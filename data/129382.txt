RATING: 8
Rating based on the quick/family game with 4 players.  Note: your mileage/opinion of what's important in a game may vary.

Components [9/10] - Overall excellent and high quality (counters could have been cut a little better but easily fixed).
Cost [8/10] - A little pricey but not overly so considering the component quality.
History/Theme [14/20] - Theme integrated seamlessly into the game.  Not a lot of history presented but what is presented seems to be correct.  Would have liked to see some dinosaurs on the counters, but that's just the creationist in me talking.
Strategy [6/10] - Some strategy involved but not clear yet how it best translates to victory points.
Fun Factor [8/10] - Not quite at the Catan level but enjoyable.  Almost continuous play for all players is a plus.
Replayability [10/10] - Looks to be a different experience every time.
Length [8/10] - Took around an hour which seemed about right, not too short/not too long.
Intangibles [18/20] - Met my expectations for a light strategy game with a Biblical theme, the ability for a wide range of ages to play, and something that will get to the table often.  Option for a deeper game is a bonus.

Overall: [81/100] = 81.0%

What a clever little semi-coop. Lots of interesting things going on with these mixed mechanics but the coolest part is how well they integrate into the theme, IMO. Quick and easy to learn, too. Lots of fun! My favorite Noah's Ark game

RATING: 5.5
A cute game with a refreshingly different theme, but ultimately it's not very good with two players. Since there is little advantage to scoring only one of a pair of animals, much of the game rests on either fighting over fences, or just hoping you draw a pair of animals you want. With 3 or 4 players, the animal scoring mechanism would be much more interesting, but as I will probably only be playing this with two, it's not for us.

Wow, a family game that feels like I'm playing a real strategy game. Includes elements of worker placement, resource management, and spatial design in an accessible package. I don't mind the randomness at all. I think this game could be a classic if it was released near the time of Agricola.

Agricola light clone where everyone builds on the same board instead.

The game is not all bad but too way too long and with too many non-interesting actions. It all boils down to who can load the most animals, and here's the main problem with the game as you can have other players load all your animals if you're unlucky. In a shorter game this would have been ok or maybe even fun, but not in a two hour game.

Decent game, with some nice ideas in it. A little confusing at first.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First game was a bit clunky as the scoring mechanic is quite complicated. Second game was much better and illustrated that this game needs 4 players really since you need to be able to stop a player getting a monopoly on one end of the ark and with 3 players you cannot achieve this.

Plus 4 players means more animal pairs and thus more player interaction.
 
Really enjoy this Thank you Secret Santa you are awesome!

You wouldn't expect a family friendly theme like this to do anything particularly innovative in a worker placement game but this very nicely puts its parts together in a fresh way - timing and preparation is everything. Good game, but best with at least 3 players

RATING: 6
Primarily a game of incentive manipulation with Puerto Rico-style action selection. I quite like the main mechanisms here but the game is marred a bit by the animal tile draws that add a lot of randomness and can easily result in a huge difference in points, especially since you can "steal" other players' animals to load on the ark.

Fine family game using the Puerto Rico role-selection system. Only marred by the random draw of the animals and the fact that someone else will steal your animals and score 20+ points leaving you with 4...

FINALLY got this out to play.  (sound familiar?)   We played just the "family game"--very nice feature!  You an start out "easy".   This is a BIG hurdle in my family, so this feature is BIG!  Rating given after only one play... may go up or down.  It seems underrated on BGG to me...

Cool mechanisms: single worker placement, your actions help everyone, cooptition with the animals and cages building. However, pasted on theme, and a forgettable and boring one at that.

Simply the best game with this theme, as far as I know.
I do not like worker placement games too much, but "Village" and this game are an exception: Ark&Noah has neat worker placement (choosing "weak" actions will mean that your turn will come up earlier, so hard choices here) with a nice twist: the action you choose does not belong to you alone, all the other players will have a weaker version of your action, too (and again: in order of their worker placement ... again, some hard choices here) plus a healthy dose of luck (the animals, ranking from 1 to 4 points, are drawn from bags) ... but what else could you expect from the author of the acclaimed "Florenza", when he aims for lighter fare?
Check this out in Essen 2012!

Looks like a pretty interesting FAMILY game. Nice looking board and bits, cool worker placement mechanic that rewards all players and keeps players engaged. Would pick this one up if the right price/opportunity presented itself.

During the whole game I could only match animals 1 time. Too much randomness in picking the animals. Too large the difference with when you can load your animal first or just have to go with the flow. Probably won't play this again.

RATING: 4.5
Parziale delusione per questo gioco dal quale non mi aspettavo granché ma riesce ad essere un mix di idee rubate qua e là anche da grandi titoli come Puerto Rico, Agricola e Zoloretto. Il gioco però non solo non decolla ma risulta troppo dipendente dalla pesca delle tessere e da effetti non controllabili. Anche il calcolo dei punti ad ogni imbarco o piazzamento è poco immeditato e un po' ripetitivo.

A weak 7. Got an Acricola feel to it but with a lot of randomness in the tile draw. If it played within the promised 45-60 min it might have been a strong 7, but our first play with four players took 2h and there is simply not enough game there for that kind of time investment.

A unique blend of mechanics that include worker placement and area control with a little cooperation and negotiation.  I've only played this as a two player but with more I imagine this could be a pretty good negotiation game as you are forced to work to together when you have each others mate. This game is a point salad reward type game.  Everything you add to the ark gives you point however, it is nice to have something to show for (the completed ark) at the end of the game.

We played one complete learning game at  the Essen "Spiel12" fair.
The game components are of high quality and the graphics look great, e.g. the animal tiles. There is some tactics in placing the action marker each round and in placing the wood and pitch. Because of the theme and the rather low difficulty/game weight it's still a family game. However don't expect a deep strategy game.

Light to Medium Euro with a spacial element that really makes it stand out for us.  Slightly more confrontation than standard Euro due to spacial element of building the ark.

A smooth action selection game with non-obvious decisions and clever co-operating incentive mechanics.  

(More games in: the randomness of the tiles is the only bad thing about this.  Unfortunately, it's quite a big element.  But it's still a good short game.)

FLGS buy... Battered box lid new inside - Hence cheap!

The Good: Nice theme, everyone so far seems to like it

The Bad: NOT a 45 min game as per description... A recent 4 player game (admittedly with 2 new, but fairly experienced gamers) took well over 1.5 hours! Scoring can be a bit fiddly to explain. So far in the games I've played, I've only managed to pair up 1 set of animals per game...

Will definitely be playing again though.

Really dug this first two plays, and that's with getting the rule about not being able to divide an already completed corral wrong, which was the one thing that bugged us. Turn order/selection mechanism is pretty brilliant.

This is listed as Worker Placement, but it's actually Role Selection. The role selection portion of the game works almost identically to San Juan, except you mark your "role" with a meeple instead of taking a role card. That's not a complaint, though; I found the game quite enjoyable. It's on the light side, but that's as expected. While the theme is (theoretically) family friendly, the pairing up of animals does lend itself to some bawdy jokes with an adult group.

There is no doubt that my wife would be consumed by trying to match all the animals into pairs and building pens for them to stay safe in. But, I'm going to let her find out this game exists by herself.  Deeper problem solving game than I had imagined from looking at the box.

RATING: 9
Very enjoyable worker placement game with the color of the workers having a fundamental effect on what you get for placing them.

Lots happening to tempt you into being distracted from your long term goals to respond to what's on offer in the short term - you have to keep aware of which first-player-only bonuses are on hand and what "deals" may shortly be actioned by you or another player. Should you divert from your strategy so that you can take advantage of them or stay focused on the end game?

Players cannot block each other.  The workers are placed on your own player board and the building of track and stations does not preclude other players from building them in the same places - it's just that the first player to build a station in each city/telegraph location gets a bonus.

My only slight reservation is replayability.  Having won by pushing my marker to the maximum value on two of the three performance tracks (for connecting level 5 stations and for the number of telegraph houses) and then connected to the 3 level 5 stations (which was never really in doubt as track placement cannot be blocked) and getting 5 of the 8 telegraph houses built, in the next game I'd be tempted simply to pursue the same strategy.  Hopefully the slightly randomized station bonus tile placements and different initial milestones each player is given might nudge me into following a different path.

In any event I thoroughly enjoyed playing the game. You have a wide variety of choices on each turn, made wider each time you acquire or change the color of another worker.  Yet the mechanism remains extremely simple:  on your turn, place a worker.

The production is fabulous:  the components are of very good quality, the artwork is lovely, the rule book is excellent, the icons and wording are clear and the game flows really well.

PS Our four player game lasted 3 hours, including setup and reading the rules.  AP was occasional.

Interesting, albeit mostly solo, efficiency puzzle. We implemented the Western Union 'hotfix' and it seemed relatively balanced, although building the telegraph stations is still the easiest thing to do. Came a comfortable 2nd.

RATING: 3
Some nice mechanics included and solid gameplay - but the game is completely broken.
There is one mcertain strategy which is much stronger than everthing else and wil always win.

2nd problem: almoste no interaction, which is relevant for choice of strategy
3rd problem: There is hardly any variation in starting setup and the course the game is taking.

Because of those 2 points combined, you would have no reason to explore different strategies from game to game, even if there were severals balanced possibilities.

Yet, the game has one dominant strategy, and starting setup and other player's strategic approach makes no difference, so every game is the same and the same strategy wins always and nothing can change that.

Faulty design.

RATING: 5
Typical fare from What's Your Game; a solitaire-ish optimisation puzzle topped off by a point salad.  There is some thematic fidelity in terms of railways expanding westwards across the USA and the importance of the telegraph.  There are also nonsensical elements like the four varieties of train that enable different actions, the stocks that are just a second currency, and the sale of unbuilt stations and track rather than transporting passengers and goods as the main means of earning money. The idea of building a pool of specialist workers and trashing the non-specialists is quite interesting.  Though, as implemented here, the choice of one colour over another seems more driven by contracts they will be trashed to complete than by their unique actions. 

Production quality is good and the artwork is quite pleasing.

Got this second-hand as I didn't want to pay full price because of the known broken strategy, but tweaked the rules as per a suggestion on BGG and in our first game no-one majored on WU.  Very enjoyable Euro game with lots of ways to score points, the challenge being to optimise your many possible actions.  The key is managing the type and number of workers, and also trying to maintain a supply of shares so you can take advantage of deals.  Happy to have a copy.

On first play, I found the game to be good, and at times really fun (I really liked the colored meeples and their differential benefits, as well as the deal mechanic with shares), but following the game, I also found myself thinking that this the game must be improved with some house rules on future plays.  

First, the Western Union option likely needs some tweaking as it seemed to be quite the way to go to win the game. In looking into the forums on BGG, it seems that the designer has approved a variant wherein moving up on the Western Union track multiplier requires MUCH more money ($500-$500-$1,000 instead of $50-$50-$100).  That might work.  Without a modification of some sort, the only way this game will work on future plays is for everybodyto get in on the action in the Western Union area, thus neutralizing its advantages.  That might work.

Second, I felt like the game needed a bit more interaction or feeling of direct competition between the players.  And yes, I do realize, there is some competition to earn the "first person to build a station here" advantages.  In the final analysis, though, that felt like too little.  

In three and four players games, perhaps limit the number of stations in certain cities, and western union spots, by a randomized "2 stations maximum in this city" chit distribution at the beginning of the game, thus making for enhanced replayability and some unique challenges each game?  

As it is, the game feels like a good idea, a good design, that wasn't quite polished into a great design.  Bottom line:  if I am going to play this game again, variants are going to be needed.

RATING: 7
At its core this really is a fun, quick-playing, puzzly strategy game. Every decision you make is a tough and meaningful one. The flow of the game is just perfect. Without the variant, there is some luck in the milestones (which is acceptable). The theme is there, but somehow it doesn't come through very strongly in the play itself. Weird, as everything you do makes nice thematic sense, but somehow it doesn't add up. I love the art and the components are of fine quality. However, the biggest problem I have with the game is that it is unbalanced. Compared to the weak and difficult (but interesting) milestones, the Western Union strategy is too easy and gets too many points to be ignored. This robs the game of its fun and can make it, at worst, quite dull. Basically, in its current form, there is no replayability without heavy house rules. This was a fully acknowledged choice by the designers and they pretty much doomed their game, played even with the official variants. A great game ruined by stupid design choice. But I still give it a 7, as the core play is great and the unbalance can be fixed by houseruling.

Fun factor: 5/5 (until players start abusing the lack of balance)
Strategy vs. luck: 4/5
Mechanics/gameplay tied to the theme: 3/5
Component/art quality: 4/5
Replayability: 1/5 (3 with house rules to fix the WU)

Very good game where all decisions felt good and much tighter/quicker than a great like Nippon.  Only major concern is that Western Union seems very powerful. It as the shortest tech track, you get contracts which lets you snowball into deals, and get not only the WU points, but also the adjacency bonuses.

Updated after a few plays:  The mechanics with different colored meeples and the game overall are wonderful.  However, it is very clearly obvious that the Western Union Strategy is far too powerful.  Other friends and confirming on BGG seem to arrive at the same consensus/conclusion.

Railroad revolution is not a common traingame but it is still a traingame. IIt's of course all about the theme but gameplay feels more like a typical eurogame. After my first play I had the feeling that the row of stations is the least interessant and that's why I'm starting with an 8 score. Should my thought be wrong, than the game can become a 9. For the rest a strategic game with clear actions and because of the different workers enough variety and actions to choose from

The intrinsic puzzle of how to allocate your different workers is an interesting one, but after 3 plays I already feel like I have seen almost everything this game has to offer. That wouldn't be bad if the game state would see more variation due to the actions of your fellow players, but as it is interaction is almost non existent in this game, so I don't see a lot of reasons to return to this one regularly.

Probably best suited for people who appreciate solo optimization with only marginal interference from 'outside'. I can play a nice game like that every now and then, but I vastly prefer games were I have to anticipate the moves of my opponents as this is usually the doorstep towards emergent depth of play.

I knew nothing about this game before I played it. It's good stuff and I'd like to play it more. I can't see how a player can be competitive without hitting Western Union hard. The 2 experienced players finished 1st and 2nd with heavy play there and the 2 of us who'd never played didn't hit Western Union much and that hurt. Nonetheless, it seems good.

RATING: 6
Played at Essen with four players. Definitely a solid game. I like the mechanics and would play it again for sure. If only to make up for all the beginners' mistakes. It just didn't feel fresh enough to pick it up myself. It reminded me too much of other WYG games I played or own. Unfortunately the rest of the group thought the same.

Rating lowered from 7 to 6. It remains a solid design, but there seems to be a dominant strategy (milk the Western Union track) and that hurts replayability. But that's not the main gripe though. Making optimal plans forces some players to extreme AP. Combine this with low-interaction multiplayer solitaire and it's hard to remember the plan you made when it comes around being your turn again.

For the strategic fun it offers there's too much downtime in my player group I'm affraid.

My favorite WYG game remains Signorie for now.

Same pedigree as other What's Your Game titles. Has the same feel as ZhanGuo and Signorie, in that you want your main action to trigger as many subactions as possible. Probably one of their lightest titles.

At first, the Western Union strategy seems overpowering, but finishing as many contracts/milestones as possible seems to balance that. I think you have to go hard one or the other, with either having a chance at winning. The Western Union strategy is probably a bit easier to do, since it's free to lay down a telegraph house. Reaching the 3 west coast cities is easily achievable and reaching the top of 2 tracks is standard.

Not quite sure of its long term replayability. I feel that I've already solved the entirety of its gameplay after 2 plays. But it is a decent title nevertheless.

Looks like a solid game from what I've seen in runthroughs. From the designers of Zhanguo, a game we really liked. Apparently a bit less overwhelming but still good, so it might be a better gateway. An important draw for me is also the playing time: a good euro playable in an hour? Me wants!

Doubting because:
- the theme doesn't interest me that much and the artwork doesn't "sparkle" for me.
- I'm not sure if it will provide enough 'new' and interesting stuff in this game to get it played. If it's 'just another euro', however good it might be, it may not be the game for us.
- it has shares. I hate shares. If it's a minor mechanism in the game, then I'm ok with it; if it's a really big deal, I won't like it.


So I'm not sure, but if you've played this game and think that I would like it anyway, then I'm definitely interested!

Like many of these types of games, the game gives you several ways to score points, and you pick a couple of those ways to specialize in to maximize your score.

The interesting twist here is that you'll be fielding a crew of workers, often getting to choose the color of those workers. You always have the same four actions to choose from, but you get a different "bonus" for that action depending on what color of worker you use to perform it. You also need certain colors of workers to fulfill personal goal tiles you're dealt, so the biggest decisions in the game often boil down to what color of workers you want to gain when the opportunity is given.

Now, I thought this was a fun puzzle to undertake, but I also felt that I "got it" in one game, and that there wouldn't be much here to explore a second time. It felt like I saw what the game had to offer, and don't think there's much left to explore, but it was neat for one game. So, I don't anticipate choosing to return to it unless someone else wanted to play it, in which case I'd go along with it.

Another good game from WYG although a bit lighter than their usual fare. The theme is not super engaging, but I really like the mechanic of having the various colored meeples giving you different bonuses for each action. It adds a nice layer of strategy trying to figure out how to best use the meeples you have. My only complaint is that I feel there isn't a whole lot of different strategies. Everyone was pretty well invested in all 3 tracks by the end of our game. It came down to who did it slightly better instead of each player having the option of going for very different approaches.

With 3 players, two of us including myself were new to the game. The winner's score was double mine but that's not why I don't like the game.  The winner chose to focus almost exclusively on the Western Union section resulting in over 250 points!! The owner who had played before came in second, finishing with about 100 points less. In a game with Railroad in the title, why should NOT building railroads be the only winning strategy!? (Others have posted similar comments.) Railroad Revolution is an extremely unbalanced point salad of a game that has nothing to do with railroads :(

4 out of 10.  According to BGG, it means Not so good but could play again.

That is exactly how I feel about this game.  The mechanics are superb, the flow is great and the action selection is fun.  What's the problem you'll ask?  Well, you'll ask if you haven't played it, otherwise you know it.  There's an evident broken strategy in this game.

The Western Union, the telegraph company that should have been a complement to the game, is so dominant, this is more a telegraph game than it is a train at this point.  The idea is so cool to include the telegraph as a minor side objective but why was it made an evolution track for the end game?  Just the link would have been enough.

The real problem is all actions in the game cost you ressources, except this one.  You actually gain points, benefits, ressources and thin your weak meeples out by taking this action.  All other actions are gain/loss relationship and are not worth more points at the end of the game.

So, I really wanted to like the game, I did.  But, it's a broken thing as it is.  Should there be a variant board released where Western Union is not so easy and dominant, I would play it again.  But I am afraid my copy will collect dust on my shelf for a long time, if not forever.

WYG does it again, but I like this even more than the last few from them (best since Madeira). Flows very smoothly. Lots of replay from randomized setup, with very little randomness during the game. It's one of those "choose a focus, and maximize the progression track that rewards your area of focus" games. Given the multiplicative effect, you can't treat it as a point salad and sample the points from each of the sources.

Another train game but this time with a focus more on workers and area control instead of route building - you can't lock anyone out of laying track. There is a lot going on and trying to navigate the system as efficiently as possible is the real challenge. While a fun worker placement game and tight with 4 players, I didn't feel that there was anything out of the ordinary here. It also departs from most train themed games in that the rail network is merely an afterthought to make the theme work. It's really area control, goal collection game in the same vein as ZhanGuo. Played it, liked it but don't think it adds enough new to own. Would play again.

Still don't know why I like this game so much, but it climbs a few more notches as one of my favorite euros.

[April 2017 - 8.4]
I don't tend to enjoy games that are low on interaction with other players. It feels too much like playing solitaire. I want at least some battles... some blocking... some negotiation.

Railroad Revolution has none of that (maybe some slight blocking for the first-placement bonus), but for some reason, I really like it. It strikes the right amount of a varying puzzle (depending on the board setup and your mission tiles) that isn't exactly obvious right away how best to solve it. All the while, you do have to keep an eye on the other players and see what strategies and scoring they are going after -- not to block them, but to keep up with them because the game has a great self timer on it and goes pretty fast.

And overall, Railroad Revolution is pretty easy to explain as far as actions go. On it's basic level, have a choice of one of four actions on each turn. It's how you modify those basic actions with your different-colored workers that adds some complexity, more strategy and great thinking moments (a crib sheet like this one really helps beginners -- https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/141166/one-page-summary-actions-bonuses-and-worker-abilit) 

With all those choices, you usually have about three or four great options to take every turn. And yet, everything is always pretty tight ... you always need more money, you always need more shares, you always need more workers. You want to do everything.

A real pleasant surprise!

Over the last few months, I've really come to like What's Your Game?. All of their games scratch that optimization and engine building itch. Railroad Revolution is no exception, you get what you expect. The main mechanic that drives Railroad Revolution is the building of a specialized work force where different colored workers add different bonus actions to your base action. The optimal chaining of this bonus actions seems to be the key to winning. 

While I enjoy the system they used here and everything works, I'm missing that one special thing that makes me want to play Russian Revolution over and over again. This is strange, since I thought that the colored workers would be it after reading the rules. But in reality, I was a little underwhelmed by the execution of this mechanic. It feels like something is missing, but I still can't put my finger on what it is. However, I've enjoyed the games I've played so far and there's always the chance to alter my rating. So for now, Railroad Revolution is a 7.

Brain burning, medium weight, forgiving worker placement about building railroad in US. One of those games where you always have bunch of valid actions to take on your turn, it only matters to select the most optimal one, with the best combo. And there is a lot of combos. A single action always does at least three things. There are 4 paths to victory, and one of those paths seems like dominant, but still there is a lot to explore around it.

By the designers who made ZhanGuo, a game I quite like. Unfortunately, this one fell flat for me which totally surprised me. The problem is that it’s devoid of the player-created tension that makes ZhanGuo so good. Like ZhanGuo, there’s a gimmick here. In this case, it’s using colored meeples to get a bonus action whenever you take a main action. Each main action offers you the option of a bonus action if you use a non-white worker. 

And that’s it. That’s pretty much the game, using colored workers on your own player board to chain actions efficiently. You don’t block each other on the main board nor do you take up precious spots (as you do in ZhanGuo). Nor do you take up limited VP spots but instead push your marker up a VP multiplier track. You're guaranteed to score as many points as you can create without being locked out. Interaction is merely asking “Are you done?”

In ZhanGuo, you need to pay attention to what cards people have left to guess-timate if you’ll be able to play a card for the bonus action and you have to check if people can beat you to a spot on the board. The tension of racing the others while trying to build and run your engine is what makes that game sing for me.

Here, they seem to have purposefully stripped out the blocking and racing for limited VP spots. All that’s left is a dry, solitairish affair of playing against your own ability to be efficient. I wish it had been further developed to add some element of player induced tension.

2016-12-01: Liked it but  you ALWAYS felt constricted by the different currencies. If you had dudes you used them and had nothing. If you then got shares you used them and had nothing. Same with cash. It was like running fast up a steep hill to get a LOAD of something just to fall right down in the next turn. :D Not a bad thing but felt different!

Of course, part of the game, is also to plan your very limited building-materials but you felt really constricted towards then end when you didn't have any more houses to build for instance.

I liked it. Not sure if the variable setups are that very different though and a little worried about replayability.

It has a LOT of similarities in the mechanics with both Nippon and Signiorie.

Very balanced game about railroad building, without blocking mechanics.
Just a race to get some 1st player bonus (that you can get anyway with  a blue worker).
You have to time your "deals" right (special cards that require you to spend shares to get bonus actions).
Looked a bit "too balanced" as with different strategies we ended up within 2 points of each other.

Loads of different things to venture into.  Really like the Western Union action play - history brought to life.  Played a couple of times now and do not think there is actually an issue with the Telegraph offices being overpowered.  Gamers simply need to be aware of how VP's are awarded before the end of the game arrives!!

One can easily see that Railroad Revolution is part of the WYG catalog. It's a game heavily focused on action efficiency, with lots of mechanically intertwined options. It is, however, also a bit cleaner and more streamlined than other recent offerings from the publisher which in my eyes is certainly an improvement. Then again, it also is quite a bit less interactive (one might even say not at all) and that is just as certainly not an improvement.

Würde man die Packung weglassen und einen Spieler in einem Ratespiel raten lassen, um welche Verlagskreation es sich handelt, würde es sofort "Das ist WYG!" aus ihm schiessen  - so sehr haben sich die Schwergewichts-Italiener über die Jahre ihren Stil geschaffen. Auch stilistisch reiht sich RAILWAY REVOLUTION in das Konzept: eine mechanistisch getriebene Kopfsache in geschmiertem Öl, hier als Eisernes Ross durch Amiland. Thematisch jetzt kein Burner. Aber dafür wieder ein Euro-Erlebnis als neue Variante gewohnter Zahnräder: verschiedenfarbige Eisenbahn-Worker lösen zur Hauptaktion noch eine farbige Nebenaktion bzw Vergünstigung der Hauptaktion aus. Das Ganze gekoppelt mit üblichen Multiplikationsleisten für die Schlußwertung. Leider krankt das Spiel an seiner strategischen Monotonie: die Kombination aus Telegrafenleiste und 5er Städte ist nicht zu schlagen und daher für alle in jeder Partie zwingend, wenn man um den Sieg mitspielen will. Das dämpft den Wiederspielreiz auf Dauer. Schade um die gute Idee.

RATING: 8
Components: really good quality
Complex:medium, easy to teach, not hard to learn
Weight: medium
Players: best with 4
Length: 1 to 1:30 hours
Mechanics: worker placement, worker/deck building
Decisions: lot
Opinion: we have to help the develop of the rail to the west, while we "invest" in the telegraph. For doing so you place one of your workers in your tableau and execute the action, only 4 actions available, but, depending on the type of worker you place you will have some other benefits, and you will not have all your workers again until all are used.
Loved the game, it is true that there is no much interaction in the game, besides the run to place yourself in some good spots, but this can ruin your strategy. In order to win you have to manage well which workers do you need and which actions you will use for them. Several ways of winning, although the Telegraph seems the easiest one, is not the ultimate.
You can go for VP with the telegraph, placing stations on different cities, building your railroad, buying trains or connecting the western cities... all accompanied with 3 tracks of performance giving you different multipliers for your actions.
In a nutshell, is a really lovely game than can be played in less than one hour and a half, which escalates well with different players and offer you enough deep to burn some of your grey cells. Yes, there is not much interaction, but you have to keep an eye on what others are doing if you need the first place bonus. And you have to focus on your strategy since the beginning

A really fun, clever game that is incredibly impaired by the ease of the Western Union strategy. I've seen expert players completely break the game by using the WU to great effect, which will unfortunately leave every subsequent game feeling like I need to script out my moves if I want to win. This game had so much potential and at one point was my favorite What's Your Game game. It is still great, but could have been so much more.

RATING: 7.4
It was a fun game, and the mechanics were fairly easy to pick up.  Like a lot of Euro games the theme was very light, and didn't tie in to the mechanics at all.  It seemed like there was one obvious 'best' way of winning -from how the victory points were allocated - and there was not much variety in how it could be set up and so I would be surprised to find much replay-ability.  The only real difference from game to game will be the objectives, but these were quite samey anyway, so again, not much replay-ability.

It was a good challenge to find the best ways of using your workers, but a lot of the secondary abilities seemed much weaker than others and I used the same few over and over.

Overall it was enjoyable, but I think I would grow bored of it much quicker than some stronger games with a similar style.

A very point salad-y incarnation of the building of railroads across America.

Another excellent game from WYG.  With only 4 base actions, this game is fairly easy to dive into, but it has a lot of nuance from the sub-actions and workforce customization.

RATING: 9
I mean, it does all of the standard WYG? stuff. It has actions that come with bonus actions so that you need to always be balancing different outcomes and choosing the action you take keeping both axes in mind, and it has multiple competing end game point goals so that when you're working towards one thing you can't take your mind off of the other goals, you need to make them work in concert as much as possible.

I also think the dominance of a particular strategy is a bit overblown. It really is just a very simple to execute strategy and so of course early on it's going to be the most successful since people are playing it closer to optimally.

There's also the issue of interaction. It's definitely not multiplayer solitaire. The first to a spot bonuses are really huge, and the game is enough about efficiency to the point that you should be planning around getting those most places you build stations. And the act of setting off deals not when you need them but when you see that your opponent who also needs something can't yet afford it.

Ok
The deal can confuse the turn order. The multiple workers are nice, but some are obviously stronger.

The score multiplier forces you ito a strategy early on.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (April 2017)

What's Your Game? is perhaps my favorite publisher. They simply do the kind of games I like the most so I was expecting good things from Railroad Revolution and it didn’t disappoint.

The rules of the game aren’t very complex, you can explain them under 18 minutes.

The game´s components and art are ok, the graphic design is functional. It´s funny that the game didn’t come with the traditional player aid sheet and I miss it (a very minor issue for me), instead the help aid is on the rulebook.

The train theme is neutral to me.

Railroad Revolution´s decisions are interesting and non-obvious, you only have four main actions (build a station, build railroads, build telegraph offices and gain money) but many sub actions that depend on the kind of worker you use, there are four specialized workers and a general one. Also there are spaces in which you can strike deals with entrepreneurs and some company goals you are striving to achieve. Good stuff, I particularly like the specialized workers (that´s the innovation of the game). I previously have seen this mechanism in Archon, but here it works much better.

The luck factor is very low, only the company goals are dealt at random but you choose from 3 available, so you can control it. This is important to me in strategy games :D. You can plan ahead and have a lot of control over all your game. On the same topic, there is very little interaction between players (there is a bonus for the player who builds a telegraph or station first). I know this bothers some people but I like it, the player who plans the best will be the winner.

Railroad Revolution has a high replay value, each game is different due to the randomize city, bonus and telegraph tiles.

Bottom line, I really like Railroad Revolution. It has interesting decisions and a very low luck factor, it is a good strategy game and a keeper for me and I continue to love What's Your Game? games. It is reminiscent of some aspects of Signorie and lighter than most games of that company, but still a good game.

Initial play was good, but I am definitely not as impressed as I am with ZhanGuo by the same designers. I think there is a good game here, but I wonder if the game will be too fast for my liking (over too quickly). Ultimately, I want to play again very soon, which is a good sign. 

A second play left me wanting more. I love the direction given by the milestones (some might find it too restrictive I guess). It seems really challenging to complete the D milestones before the endgame is triggered, especially since that means promoting at least 7 workers (and you can never have fewer than 4 at any time).

I enjoy the game play quite a bit, but I am finding that the D milestones are not as viable as pursuing the telegraph offices heavily (in addition to some low level milestones). The game seems to need some tweaking to balance certain aspects a bit more.

'Nippon light' or 'Ticket to Ride Extremely Advanced'.  Does not reinvent the wheel, but has good strategic gameplay, tight economy and the multiplayer solitaire aspect is fully forgiven when the flow is so good and it still feels like a tense race for points

RATING: 6
I guess the innovation here is the worker management piece, which is a bit like managing a hand of cards. You start the game with 4 white neutral workers, but throughout the game you add or swap for four other colors. Each color gives you a different bonus action in addition to one of the four main actions you can take on a turn. You also need to retire specific colors of workers in order to meet "milestone" cards which are worth a lot of points. While there are other ways to get points, managing your workers is the heart and soul of the game, which doesn't make this feel very much like a train game at all. That could be good or bad depending on your tastes, but this sure looks like a train game from the title and the box art!

You can use actions to place tracks that connect cities, place a station in a city you are connected to, add a telegraph office to a string of office spaces across the bottom, or sell a rail or station piece that has not yet entered play. Placing city stations and telegraph offices give bonuses according to tiles that are distributed at the start of the game, just like in The Voyages of Marco Polo. In fact, this feels very much a similar game with the worker management mechanics replacing the dice management. There are intertwined scoring opportunities and ways to get extra things by buying trains (they are just bonus action tiles) or sacrificing workers at the telegraph office and it is all well put together to be sure. But frankly, I find the dice management of Voyages more fun and I see no reason to explore this one further.

I was unpleasantly surprised by this game. For a game where you're building a rail network there is a shocking absence of player interaction. The optimization challenge is somewhat fun but it's lonely out there, and I'm not usually one to complain about multiplayer solitaire.

More than the lack of player interaction, the game is devoid of tension in any form. I don't need the tension to come from other players necessarily but I do need some tension. The action selection mechanism has zero tension. Each turn you place one of your available meeples on an action on your board and do it (no limits or constraints). The colour of the meeple determines the bonus action you get. Once all your meeples have been placed you get them all back. 

You can build rail anywhere you're connected to. There is room for each player to lay rail in each space. Likewise you can build a station anywhere you're connected to, although the first to build gets a small additional bonus on top of the bonus everyone gets when they build there.

To make matters worse (for me) the game uses multiplicative scoring which means that you need to decide fairly early on what strategy you're going to pursue and then hit it hard. There's no mix and match, stay flexible strategy. 

This game was a complete flop for me. I've been surprised by others' reactions to the game. They are mostly positive. I'm surprised that I'm somewhat of an outlier in this case. I can't explain it. Perhaps people really love strategy games with almost no interaction so that you can intricately plan 5 to 10 turns at a time.

Downgraded to 3/10 due to the dominant telegraph /5 cities strategy.
---
Strategically straightforward with minimal player interaction. The three multiplier tracks (west coast city connections / stations / telegraphs) define the three basic strategies and give players focus. At the same time, the requirements of the orders are a constant deviation making things interesting. Variation comes from the distribution of the city bonus tiles and the order of the trade offers. Timing the trades that other players cannot participate and being first to a spot to gain the first player advantage are the only interactive elements.

Railroad Revolution is the WYG title for players who like to build long-term plans. Hopefully, no strategy is overpowered. My gut feeling is that pushing out telegraphs is a must but another player opined that the west coast connections are very strong. So far a good sign that indicates that there might be some beef in controlling game length.

The main gimmick of the game are the multi-colored worker meeples. You choose from 4 different actions, with a bonus effect that's determined by the color of the meeple you used to take the action. Technically this works, but it just didn't seem to go places. It wasn't as if taking a meeple of a specific color was some kind of a meaningful commitment.

The rest of the game just felt like the blandest point salad ever.

2017-08-06 - Overcomplicated eurogame with too many artificial unnecesary mechanisms and I don't like that. Symbols are not well thought and don't help.

The mechanics are interesting, the production value is ok and the game is rather fun to play.  It's certainly a point salad but I don't mind it.  The colored meeples with various side benefits are cool, and selecting which to get / use / spend is nice.  This being said, the game balance is essentially broken, to a point where it's so blatant that it makes you wonder how the designer / qc let it through.  Despite the appearance of multiple paths to victory, a properly executed Telegraph+WesternCities will trigger an early endgame before any 'D' milestones can be completed, ensuring victory.  Anyone trying to defend the balance of this game either 1- doesn't play with really competitive players, or 2- is totally drinking the cool-aid.  You would need serious house ruling to fix this (we play with "pick any milestone you want out of the deck" and it's not enough).  If everyone is on the ball, this makes the game heavily scripted with chaos (timing & nature of deals, nickel-and-diming on 1st placements) mostly determining winner.  This is a real shock and surprise coming from What's Your Game.  I see a trend recently of games that are complex enough that balance issues make it to release and fanboys hand wave the problem away saying "the game is super rich, you just haven't figured out the other competitive routes yet, it's balanced, it has to be".  Well no, deep complex games can still be unbalanced and this one is.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I want to play again. In my first play I didn't think about the fact that I would end the game before I was ready and there was nothing I could do about that fact due to having to remove or place the last station before the end game slot after I had my track finished. Oops! There definitely needs to be focused play which is generally going to be driven by the contracts one has. The game can end much more quickly than one expects/thinks. This is a lighter WYG game in that it is more streamlined than many of their other titles - it isn't quite as fiddly either. There's still plenty to think through although the stocks are odd in that they generally just can be sold for cash or used for bonus actions. The aspect where the different color workers provide a bonus action is also interesting - such a shame that they are generally promoted so quickly!

(10/17) 7. A cool rail building/worker placement.  It's got many mechanisms similar to Euros nowadays where there are a lot of avenues for scoring including multiple tracks you can increase during the game for end of game scoring.  Very solid.

This is the level of euro I just really don't like.  Heavier ones can get my attention sometimes (although increasingly not anymore that rules complexity is considered the primary indicator of weight) and light ones can be fun in their simplicity, but this has just enough stuff to do to be tedious and too little to be really satisfying.  Just kind of a watered-down game, it feels like.  Seems like the Western Union stations are very strong.

The components are fine.  The cardboard money sucks, but relying on in-game money is the road to madness anyway.  I don't like the chalkboard-scrawl of the station prices above each city; I feel that's less than readable at a glance.

One huge/minor graphical problem is the game's use of the minus sign to indicate debits.  This isn't how money games usually indicate debits, this isn't how ledgers indicate debits, and although I usually consider myself adaptable to conventions I couldn't get used to it.

RATING: 6
Enjoyed my first play. The Western Union issue isn't as bad as I had expected. I maxed out on the level 5 track for 75 points without too much difficulty. The WU track maxes out at 72 with maybe another 40 for the adjacency bonuses. But if you go in that direction you are placing 8 houses there and only have a couple left for building in cities. You won't get many of the A-D bonuses because of this. I'll have to play again but it seems much ado about nothing. Perhaps make the WU track cost 150-150-300 (rather then 50-50-100) to match up with the middle track and call it a day.

Plays much more smoothly than Signorie and Zhanguo (though I think Zhanguo might be the better game).

RATING: 9
Excellent game by the makers of the great Zhanguo. This is an excellent successor of the same high level. Laying track, building telegraph posts and stations. The game is actually a race, because of the interesting bonuses there are at each location you arrive first. At the same time it is sort of a meeple poolbuilder: during the game you acquire meeples of various colours. Using these meeples to take an action will give you a special bonus depending on the colour of the meeple. A very smart and innovative mechanism. Highly recommended this game. Marco Canetta, Stefania Niccolini and WYG again have produced a winner.

Nice game. Some good new ideas. Lot's of different ways to victory. Played with four players with very different strategies, but still very similar results. It reminds me from some included mechanics a little bit to Zhanguo, which is also designed by the same authors. But this one seems to be even better and more round. Of course it is one more railroad game, but not a typical one. I really like it and would enjoy to play it again.

There is sooooo much gong on in this game that it is difficult to see what is the best path to maximise VPs. I like the mechanisms and they all mesh well.
After only one play I need to play it again to get to grips with it properly.
On a second play this game is becoming a favourite. There is a lot going on but it moves along at a swift pace and we completed a 4 player game in just 100 minutes.
Looking forward to more plays.
The more I play this game the more I enjoy it! Rating increased.

Very quick and breezy Euro, especially for a WYG title. I wasn't a big fan of the designers' other game, Zhan Guo, but I did think this one was fine for what it is. The various goals and things made the game feel a little too deterministic for my tastes, however, and the different worker types felt more refined in Nippon. I would probably play this again if asked, but I'd say it's a distant fifth in terms of my favorite games from this company.

A bit light to my tastes, but its a fun game. Very enjoyable. Probably the lightest from WYG until now. Seems like they are changing their target to reach a bigger audience.

Lots and lots to do here, perhaps even a little too much, in pursuit of the old 'balancing sliders' gamers' standby. I like it - the theme comes through sufficiently, and you are able to strategise properly due to minimal interaction. The interaction levels will probably be make or break for many players, though.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]Wow, a couple of plays in and I'm really enjoying how Railroad Revolution plays out. This is the second What's Your Game game I've played, the other being ZhanGuo which was designed by the same guys and you can see some similarities between the two games, but they both stand on their own.

There are a few design decisions that really make this game fun to play and a lot of strategies to explore. One of the key decisions the designers made was to allow for a lot of flexibility when carrying out your actions. Basically you are free to carry out any regular actions and bonus actions in any order you want; this really opens the game up and allows you to cobble together some great turns. Also each of the different worker colors will trigger a bonus associated with each action, so managing your pool of workers is key to doing well. RR is definitely about being efficient in your actions, especially choosing the right color worker to trigger an action and then grant the bonus action that you need. There is plenty of opportunity to trigger multiple bonuses each turn, not only do the workers trigger bonuses a lot of the actions you take also have bonuses attached to them. You have stock which can either be used as cash or at certain points in the game trigger a different area that grants extra actions. Finally when it comes to scoring there are multiple paths to explore so I'll be playing this one for a while.

There is a lot to like in this game, if any of the above sounds interesting check out RR there is too much to talk about in a quick write up. After playing RR and ZhanGuo I am excited to try other WYG games, especially Signore and Nippon.[/i]

There is no way this is the lightest WYG game.  I would put it right after Madeira in terms of complexity, and especially learning.  In a four player game with three players never having played it before this game took over three hours.  It plays much better than it looks,  but you really will not care what anyone else is doing.  You are focused continually on your own actions and objectives.  The only time there is any interaction is with the timing of the deals.  If you see a good one coming up you can plan to make sure you have enough shares to take advantage of it when somebody sets it off.  There were at least three missed opportunities for myself because I did not plan for these deals  and was not able to use them when they were activated.  There is much talk about the telegraph track being overpowered and I did see that all four players went heavy on it.  You cannot avoid it if you want to stay in the game.  I tried working on objectives only but there is no way I would compete just doing that.  But as far as solitaire optimization puzzles go, this was a lot more fun than fields of Arle. For WYG titles, (out of 5 played), I would put this third behind Madiera, Zhanguo, but above Vinhos, Signorie.

In Railroad Revolution, players build tracks, train stations, and telegraph stations across America. The game works via an action selection mechanism in which players place a worker on an action space on their player board, and then execute the action as well as a bonus action that depends on the color of the worker. Being the first player to build a station somewhere often yields an extra bonus, leading to a bit of a race feel. The main source of points are contracts whose values increased as you completed more of them, as well as multiplier tracks for building the various things. The game played quicker than expected, so time pressure was definitely present. I think it worked pretty well overall.

I need to play this with more players, but 2 was fine. I think the competition might make this go up a point. The rules are pretty simple and this is probably the easiest WYG? game, but it's still medium weight. Lots of choices and points were pretty high. You want to do a little bit of everything but you have to focus. Money is both super easy to come by when you don't need it and when you do, it's never available. The same goes for shares.

What's Your Game? Game! Of course I had to try it out! I am not generally a fan of train games. This has the network building but you can't get cut off from other people. Everyone can go everywhere- there is a benefit to getting there first though. I actually find this to fit into their catalog very well. It is lighter than some of their other titles but it works well. I get why people have been raving about it. I would certainly try again. I worry about the dominant strategy you might read about in the forums.

Railroad rev is a delicious puzzle, but it's been a long time since I've seen a game that multiplayer solitaire. Players do their best to build out a network of connections that will score them points based on how well they can complete their achievement tiles. When you complete one of your tiles, you get the opportunity to get another of a higher difficulty and a higher reward, but as the game progresses your supplies start to run out, making it harder to get done what you need to in time for the end of the game. I'm excited to play more, but since you really don't care what your opponents are doing (for the most part) I think a full compliment of 4 players might be a bit much.

There is an overwhelmingly strong path through the game, which does nearly kill it, although if this gets fixed with an expansion, the core mechanisms here are good enough that I'd absolutely come back.

A rail game where the players build stations, track and telegraph stations across the United States. The player mat has the 3 actions along with a sell asset which allows you to get money at the cost of losing one of your buildable components. The gimmick are color meeples that allow for a bonus when you take an action. Each color has a slightly different flavor of what is allowed. Also being first in an area gives a bonus giving a bit of a race flavor. You cannot recycle the workers until all have been used. As you collect more workers you are also draining workers to get bonuses and complete contracts for victory points, quite a trade off. The 3 progression tracks are the multipliers which score for what you have build on the board, west coast track, stations, telegraph.
The game played quicker than I expected and the threat of the end game does impact your decisions. Overall it went well.

RATING: 7.5
[u]The Positive[/u]
(+) This essentially is a real point salad game, but it is a very balanced one, offering many strategic approaches in order to try to steal away the victory. The one who holds true to his/her strategic path (the game offers many, and I don't think there is one dominant path) and executes it in the most efficient way will win.

(+) The game is strikingly easy to learn: players take turns clockwise and you get to take one of four actions by using a (specialized (4 different types) or non-specialized) worker. Depending on the worker your choose, you are able to get an additional bonus-action. That's it. Yet, despite the rules being simple and the game being easily structured, there is more than enough interesting decision making to be had.

(+) This is a real strategy game, much more than a tactical one (it has its tactical opportunistic moments, but all in all this is a long-term strategy game). I love strategy games and there are too few of them out there!

(+) The setup is very random: the benefits for building stations, telegraph posts, starting resources, starting milestones (company goals allowing you to score big points when reaching them), starting specialized worker, ... - this is all layed out differently in each game, which means players will need to assess the best strategic paths to follow at the start of each new game. This will ensure replayability. 

(+) The gameflow is rather smooth and quick with very little downtime. Players stay involved during other players turns because of a mechanic called 'deals', which can trigger a phase at the end of an opponents turn in which all players who own shares can participate.

(+) The game engine is simple and elegant but offers much more freedom than eurogamers are used to. Yes, this is worker placement, but there are no limitations as to where you can place them (multiple workers allowed in the same action-spot). There is no area majority aspect which only allows one or two players to score points: everyone scores according to their own performance. There is no cutting other players off on the map: getting somewhere first will grant you a benefit, but further there is no stress of getting stuck. This 'freedom' makes playing this game a breeze and makes sure there is a relaxed atmosphere around the table despite players doing some serious thinking.

(+) Mechanic-wise this game does not offer much new (see 'the negative'), but I do appreciate the way your workfoce gets built up and the 'deck building' aspect with worker pawns the game uses (they get recycled after they all got used). I haven't seen this implemented in such a 'stressless' way in other games and it works nicely. I enjoyed managing where and when to use specific workers.


[u]The Negative[/u]
(-) I very much like the box art and the art on all the tiles, but the art on the game board doesn't get my heart pumping. Of course this is a matter of personal taste, and I do have to say that all the components, including the game board are cleverly designed and very functional, as is the case with all What's Your Game-titles.

(-) There is very little player interaction in this game. Personally, I don't mind this, in many occasions I appreciate a game which offers me the opportunity to work out my own strategic plans and to test them against the way others plan their game without interfering each other, but I can see this might be a problem for some. This is not to say there is no player interaction (there is some in trying to be the first to reach certain destinations or plant telegraph posts, timing triggering deal phases when opponents are out of shares, etc), but player interactions is really limited here. For me personally no big deal, but I suspect it could be for others.

(-) My only real problem with this game is that to me it lacks some character. Yes, this is a masterfully executed point salad game which runs smoothly and which turns all the right dails and pushes all the right buttons to make it work perfectly but it doesn't introduce any bold new mechanic giving this game a unique flavor.

[u]Conclusion[/u]
Railroad Revolution is an heir to an impressive line of nothing less than fantastic euro games having been released by What's Your Game in the past few years: Vinhos, Madeira, Zhan Guo (by the hand of the same designers as Railroad Revolution), Nippon, Signorie, ... these are all games that I own and cherish and it's not easy to hold your mettle when compared to these titles. Railroad Revolution probably is the easiest and most accessible of this line-up, also the shortest in playtime.

In its core, this game is an excellent point salad game which offers a variety of strategic options with no apparent dominant strategic path. The designers clearly knew what they were doing when developping this game and did their math right. The game challenges players to stay true to their strategy and to implement it in the most efficient way possible, using a fun mechanic in which players have to manage their workforce carefully.

People who thrive by player interaction should best avoid this title, as it offers very little in that regard, but for those who don't mind this, this game ensures a 'relaxed' playing experience between players, despite being challenging enough as it comes to playing it right.

Railroad revolution is probably one of the best designed point salad games I have played in quite some time: it is easy to learn, runs smoothly, keeps all players involved until the end, is strategically balanced, doens't take too long to play and rewards clever execution of actions. The only thing that really does annoy me in this title is the lack of character: without the introduction of a daring new mechanic driving this game, playing it doesn't feel like a new experience. Due to all the reasons mentioned above I very much like playing this game, but compared to previous 'What's Your Game' releases, this one falls a little short for me and I wouldn't rate this game as high as the predecessors I mentioned before. However, if you are looking for an accessible medium-weight eurogame which revolves around strategic plans in the form of a masterfully executed and balanced point salad, chances are high that Railroad Revolution is the best game in this catagory that got realeased this year.

[u]Tips for those going in[/u]
(*) There are a lot of points to be had! Aim high (> 240 points and probably much more with experienced players).
(*) There is some engine building to be had, especially with obtaining specialized workers. At the start of the game it is best to put some focus into obtaining those colorful workers as they will allow for more powerful actions during the course of the game. Go for this early by building stations on the right spots and by using purple workers on the telegraph action in order to exchange white workers for specialized ones.
(*) Shares are not worth any points in this game, but they are important as it comes to making deals. Always try to have at least 1 available share to make sure you can benefit from an opponent triggering a deal-phase. These are often useful in order to obtain or use trains, progress on the performance tracks (which leverages your point scoring engines!) or to increase your workforce. Being left out too often when deal phases present themselves is harmful. 
(*) Money is very tight, especially in the beginning of the game, and you need it badly - especially to build railroads, but also to enjoy many additional specialized worker abilities and other benefits which require payment. At the start of the game your finances are problematic and one way to handle this is to obtain a $600-train in order to power up the trade action.
(*) Multiple strategic paths to victory are possible, best is to focus on a few key-items, rather than trying to score on everything.
(*) The milestones are a very significant points generator which should not be neglected. However, they tend to break down on your engine by sucking up your specialized workers and when putting some focus on them, it is easy to run out of workers. Make sure to build up your workforce first.
(*) At the end of the game, money isn't worth points. If you are rich and the game is nearing its end, it might sometimes be a good tactical option to hire an extra worker for $800.
(*) Starting tiles which offer to build a station or a telegraph office for free but without getting the benefits seem to be the least valuable (why would you deny yourself the opportunity of getting those benefits during the course of the game?). An exception could be if an (expensive!) station on a starting ('1')-city is required for your milestone.

--Dec2016-- I quite enjoyed this:  there are some interesting decisions that need to be made.  I might have preferred a few more points of direct interaction (since much of what we did affected the others only modestly) - and the randomness (of the goal cards: will one draw something coherent with the plan one is already executing or not?) is a bit worrying.  But I'd be very happy to play again.

I enjoy building my worker pool and trying to optimize the actions I do with different kinds of workers, although I'm not sure how I feel about the randomness in the goal tiles yet.

Railroad Revolution fits well as a gateway WYG design. It's a little long on rules explaining the various possible actions, but the core of the game remains simple. The central attraction is the use of specialised workers, who trigger additional bonuses actions depending on their type. VP is earned from a few avenues, such as completing milestones, building stations in cities and expanding the Western Union network. In typical WYG fashion, there are multiplier tracks that boost the scoring of certain avenues.

As mentioned earlier, Railroad Revolution is a light-ish game by WYG standards. The rules are still quite verbose thanks to added mechanisms like deal-making and train-flipping, but it is the most accessible title by far to introduce players to the WYG school of design. (Not that I'm a fan of that school, but that's another story.) The main drag is that Railroad Revolution seems to devolve into two central strategies of the Western Union and reaching the 5-cities. It just feels intrinsically unsatisfying for a 90 minute game to boil down to two strategies, especially when little can be done to interfere with them.

This game had potential, but fell flat for me as there wasn't anything overly unique about this game. I thought the worker placement with upgrading workers was interesting, but it was better implemented in Village. The theme is pretty generic, trains/railroads.

My strategy in this game was to go out west get the 3 coast cities and max out that track. In the process of going out west, you can easily complete a few goal cards without much effort. This wasn't a brain burner for me. I felt like this game could use more interaction between players as there was little competition for resources (except to be first at a location). With such little interaction and low variability in setup, I don't think this would have much replayability.

Another big hit for WYG. Love the mechanism of the worker placement with different abilities for the same action. It's clever. So is the funding system or the small short goals. These make players focus.
Marco and Stefania are a terrific team designing some of the best games out there. Another big hit following Zhanguo.

Some thematic sense as you push your railroad west for points and glory. Feldian linked actions. I thought production very good as the graphics easy to follow and there are a ton load of actions. However, very much an almost solitaire button pushing optimisation puzzle with little player interaction other than some trying to get to things earlier than others and adding up the many hundreds of points at the end. Unlikely to play again.

I knew I wouldn't like it but I bought it anyway to get the chance to play: in hindsight, picking up another WYG! point salad was not the wisest retail therapy. The theme doesn't hold up to scrutiny (something something trains), but the key idea is bonuses galore: first to do use a location generally gets a bonus, but there are 5 different colours of worker and all of them give different bonuses too.

Just about everything you do gives you some sort of bonus, so the game is in most-efficiently stringing them together. The first-in bonuses and randomly-revealed goal cards and deals seem to inhibit long-term strategy and encourage reactive play. Conversely, because all of the meeple bonuses are good, they ultimately just seem sort of distracting -- options for the sake of options, but you can do well with any of them.

As in similar games with random choice of goals, lucking into goals you can complete easily (or have already completed) does have an impact. 

In its favour, I do appreciate that focus is rewarded; there is less forced participation in all aspects than in, say, Great Western Trail.

this is a medium weight worker placement game where money is king and hard to come by.  Most of the money is in stock certificates and we let a player get most of them as me and the other player concentrated on making the rail network bonuses.  That is NOT where the vp's are really.  WE played a couple of rules wrong.  You do not need to buy and use workers for an action. Western Union is where all the money is.  DO not let a player get all the stock available down there particular with the first action.  Heading to west coast is not as lucrative as it seems.

tl;dr: the designers of [thing=41844][/thing] do it again!

This highly regarded team of designers that previously brought us [thing=41844][/thing]... OK, to be fair, that might not be the game they're highly regarded for, but that's not the point.
In any case, they team up with What's Your Game? again, and again the result is very much in line with what people have come to expect from this publisher.
The rules are on the less complex side for them, but the game is still more than deep enough for any lover of these kinds of games. That comes mainly from the interesting action selection mechanism where the color of the worker used determines what bonus you get with your action. Very cool indeed.
I must say I'm very happy again. If WYG keeps on going this way, they'll shoot to the very top of my favorite publishers.

Good game.  Definitely a game where you can't do it all.  The 4 main tracks are all solid choices on how to get a good score, but the best score will be a clear mix of several tracks depending on the layout of the board.

There's a lot going on here. The three bonus point tracks seem to point the way to the three main strategies here: Building track, building stations or investing in Western Union. Some hybrid strategies may be possible. I like the twist on worker placement, which involves in having different types (colors) of workers that give different bonus actions when used. I need to play this a lot more to grasp the depth and subtleties that surely exist here, and the game is interesting, thematic and fun enough that I'm looking forward to doing just that!

Railroad Revolution is a game from the publisher "What's your game?" I don't know what it is about their games, but they just don't make games I really enjoy. I don't know why. Maybe it's because they feel too formulaic? There was nothing that really wowed me in this game. There's nothing wrong with it particularly, other than that it just felt "meh".

Players are trying to accomplish three types of things, building tracks, building telegraph stations and building train stations in cities. Being the first to do the last two of those actions sometimes give you a bonus and always gives you something. How much doing things is worth depends on a) the contracts you take and b) how you've advanced on the three corresponding tracks. On our first play it seemed like the "building railroad tracks and maxing the related score multiplier" was a dominant strategy, but that was just a first impression.

A bland looking game that offers a lot of interesting gameplay.  You will be using specialized workers to activate special powers to get benefits on building, laying track, and trading.  You'll move up multiplier tracks and complete objectives for big point.  It's solid, although there seems to be particular paths to victory.

This may be the closest to a purely non-interactive, multi-player solitaire game that I've ever had the misfortune to play.  Coupled with the fact that the dominant strategy is extremely boring and easy to execute means I will actively avoid this one.  I don't know what happened here.  WYG is usually reliable.

Such a What's Your Game game. Reminded me a lot of Signorie with the multiplier tracks and throwing stations onto spaces on the board. Not a bad game though. You have to be careful going for bonuses. Can't spread yourself too thin. I'd say beef 2 of the 3 tracks you're going for because in this game you'll definitely run out of rails and stations before you're able to do everything you want to do, which is part of the game.

First impression: this feels like Nippon without the parts I disliked there. I think I would like this a bit more with a fixed ending, instead of someone triggering it.

Second impression: there seem to be two dominant strategies in the game, and even though you could argue both are equally valid, one of them is based on hidden information, and the other is more planable. That hugely spoils the game.
This is the kind of euro I enjoyed learning, enjoyed cracking the puzzle the first time, but don't want to play again. Which is a shame, because Zhanguo by the same designer duo is one of my favorite euros.

Tycoon's race to network rail and connect stations from coast to coast while investing in the telegraph.  Money is tight for capital investment and laying track over mountains costly.  Sell stock and play the market.  The signature feature is choosing when, how many, and which of your regular work force to train and promote to specialize as accountants, engineers, and other professionals which is essential to leverage moves that must always be advancing objectives.

Impressive design, where all parts interlock. Though it seems straight forward by only providing you with four actions to choose from each turn, the interactions of the different workers, trains, special powers and the order in which you process everything gives me too much to consider. Causes downtime, making the game last too long.

Played twice. I like playing it, though I'm still wrapping my head around some of the intricacies of the game.

I liked the idea of promoting your workers and sending them away to commit to project scoring. 

The game does have you spending a lot of time looking down on your board, and it is a bit multi-player solitaire.

In terms of the Western Union telegraph, other reviewers have noted, correctly, that in its current state its very powerful and can almost always win; and having played the  variant certainly helps.  My simply multiplying the Western Union track by a multiple of 10 means it costs more to move up the track and makes it more of a late strategy to save up the cash to rush up there.   

I would like to play the game again, its certainly very interesting.   It's however, not worth more than £35, and the RRP of around £40 - £50 is not competitive compared to more heavier games which brings more to the table.

I liked the game, and would play again.

Yes, I'm -still- terrible at dexterity games, but this one is so great due to its compactness and the fun little bludgeon and totem options.  It's the next-best-thing to having a full-size shuffleboard in your home.  Sooooo glad I got in on the KS bandwagon!

Decent dexterity game.  Pretty much just flicking wooden discs and trying to get closest to a target.  You get to adjust your stopping point of the disc with a piece of wood on some turns and you can cover some pieces with a thinner disc to "protect" its position.  Again, a decent little dexterity filler.

Tons of fun, especially if you are a fan of curling. I like the way the caveman hammer abstracts the brooming part. This is a game for people who want to have some light fun and even more so if they like curling. We laughed loudly, but this isn't the kind of dex game you're going to spend time trying to get good at.

RATING: 6
A very good partnership flicking game!  Pretty much the exact same scoring as curling or bocce, where you flick discs down a lane of "ice", and you get points for each of your discs that is closer to the center of the target than any of you opponents' discs.

There also some extra abilities available to you on your turn that allow you to modify your flick, and when to use these is a very important decision, adding a cool dimension to the standard dexterity flicking!

RATING: 7
Fun simple and clean flicking game. There's really no fluff here. Does some nice things to help along players who are less skilled (totems/hammers, and the general way in which a missed shot is often a good blocker). 

But I think the real star of the show here is the portability. I can't think of another disc-flicker that's this compact. So far I haven't had a strong desire to buy this as I have plenty of other games in the genre that I prefer, but I may end up getting it at some point just because of the cheap + portable factor. Though it's still a monster for table space!

Most fun in teams, I think. Though 2p is good too.

Decent quick flicking game that doesn't overstay its welcome.  Seems to me there are too many "special" pieces, though.  4 hammers and 2 totems allow quite a bit of modifiers during a round - I think might be better by removing at least 1 large and 1 small hammer.

Rating for solo playing a homemade board with discs from Hobby Lobby. They are wooden wheels. My board is very large and wooden and hand painted by me. I left it unwaxed. Unsure if I should ever wax it. As of now it is a hard flicking board. I am thinking of waxing it someday to even it out for my wife, but I feel that the dry unwaxed board is probably easier to play on. I may never wax it. Perhaps I would wax a set of discs instead.

She is not good enough to ever beat me and cares not to practice. Rating pertains to solo play.

Crokinole style flicking with a curling theme.  Unlike Crokinole, judging your distance is more important, and the board has just the right traction to enable considerable accuracy.  Wonderful components and game, and has the big advantage of being portable.

Dexterity game where you flick wooden discs towards the center of the 'fire'. It is a fun game. Discs go flying, bounce off of objects in the room if you flick too hard and you go scrambling trying to find the little pieces. 

This is a nice game to enjoy when you need a filler game and can be more fun to play using teams instead of just 2 players.

This is in fact just curling as a disk-flicking game, with some minimal mechanical additions (the hammers and totems) that don't change the feel of the game but do provide more elbow room so that even less-skilled players can set up interesting challenges for their opponents.

The derivativeness makes it a little embarrassing, like games which are clearly designed with a poker deck but then have a few extra cards thrown in to justify their existence. But the parts are nice and curling as a flick game is a fun thing to play.

Well,it's Curling, what better game can we play? The theme is 'unbeatable'. I had been watching for this for a while and picked up a copy as soon as it hit the stores. Typical 'flicking' game, which seems like it should have a few more laughs. It should be worth some plays, but I think in the long run Sorry Sliders provides a very similar game, but delivers a but better.

Well, you flick things and try to get closest to a target, while the other team/person attempts to outmaneuver you or knock you away.

It's sort of like curling, except you don't have a spiffy broom thing (and thus look slightly less idiotic), and also you are not required to do it on ice, thus dramatically reducing your chances of falling awkwardly. Trust me, this is a good feature.

RATING: 5
1 play, 2er

Pretty basic dexterity flicking game played on a paper board (rolls up into a small box). Players take turns flicking their 6 discs towards the target circle. After each flick, you may use a single special item to either (1) move that disc extra distance (length of your hammer), or (2) place a totem on top of the disc. If, later in the game, your totem touches the board then you can either reclaim the stone it used to sit on, or not; the totem is removed. At the end of the round, you score 1 VP for each of your stones closer to the center of the target than your opponent's closest stone (so only 1 player scores). Whoever scored starts the next round (players get all their stones and special objects and play again). The game continues until one player has 6+ VP = winner.

It's a pretty cool game except:
- it's way too long for a light dexterity game
- when discs start flying, it's sometimes difficult to figure out which one you just flicked or which one the totem came from

For a game where accuracy counts, I'd rather play Crokinole; maybe even Sorry Sliders (although it's been so long I don't really remember how that one worked).

Basic dexterity game; slide discs down the board. Not much excitement; not enough board space to do a lot of interesting shots or knocking pieces around. The objects aren't terribly exciting; since you've got one per piece and can use one per piece, there isn't any real decision about when to use them. Too expensive even to be a "budget" flicking game - Sorry Sliders is more fun for a simple flicking game, Disc Duelers is better (and smaller) for a complicated flicking game.

Same rating as Sorry! Sliders - same category, but with a different twist. Kairn (Caveman Curling) uses simple wooden discs on a flexible plastic mat. The discs slide smoothly enough, and each player has some special items that he or she can use to manipulate or guard the position of the last disc "thrown". As with most dexterity games, it only shines with players who are equally skilled. A game meant to be played in short bursts. Sorry! Sliders has the advantage that people can remain seated while playing; with Kairn you take turns at the same edge of the table.

RATING: 7
While not a huge fan of dexterity games, Caveman Curling is actually quite a good and fun team-based dexterity game of table top curling. The puck slides around on the wax paper quite well even though the paper is rather flimsy and thin. However, the paper can be curled up without major damage and without any creases.

I do like how the game can be split up into two teams with players from either team alternating on flicking the puck. The additional pieces to manipulate the puck, post-flicking, adds to the fun and general chaotic nature of the game. I am sure with some practice flicking, the puck will land quite accurate on target. However, this is not a game to be played every weekend. Once in a while, with the right crew, this game will bring out the Sunday laughs and smack talking.

This game is actually quite fun when played in groups. Really recommended and I might actually try to hunt for a copy. Upgraded ratings to a 7.

There's not a whole lot one can add to the basic idea of a flicking game without making it a little overdone, so Caveman Curling doesn't try to overcomplicate the game.  It's straightforward and fun.  The board rules are useful, since a failed flick might also serve as a good blocker, but I'm less convinced at the usefulness of the totems and hammers.  I understand why they're in there -- they lend some tactical support to an otherwise strictly dexterity game -- but I would prefer that the game be more about the flicking than the use of the extra pieces.  Catacombs does a good job of giving players tactical elements without taking away the importance of the flicking, but here, the extra pieces mean you don't have to strive as much for accuracy.  It's a little disappointing, but it [i]is[/i] a flicking game, and it's an awful lot of fun, regardless.

I didn't like this much at all. The great looking play mat is unfortunately quite sticky and it decelerates your flicked discs greatly, and there's not brushing or such option as in actual curling.

Fun dexterity game that essentially brings curling to a tabletop. You skill improves as the game goes on so by game's end you can pull off some quite satisfying turns.

Yes, it's bocce / shuffleboard on your tabletop, with tools with which to "cheat"; however, the tools actually add tactical and strategic choices to the game, and you end up with a quick, fun game.  This is a great social, dexterity game, that keeps you on your feet, anxious for your next flick.

Fun, but way too simple a dexterity game.

Similar to FLICOCHET or TOCCE, but with a theme added fer good measure.

It's just as much fun to flick any old set of CARROM or CROKINOLE discs at a target; Be it onto a small dot-sticker target, or even towards a different coloured playing piece. Maybe use a steel ruler as a backstop if need be.

A light-hearted romp with absolutely amazing art. I would love to get a copy of the deluxe edition of this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I have a few go at this game and felt like I wasn't getting enough fun out of it. It's short and nice-looking but it seems like the game doesn't allow for enough differences between scoring and is, of course, very luck driven. My little girl is too young to play the game but I guess it is to be considered for kid gaming / family gaming. As an adult, I'm not enjoying the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A set collection game that's maybe a little like Medici and a little like Felix...there's also even a touch of Coloretto in there.  It's quicker than the first two and about the same as the third.  The artwork is good (very similar to Felix), but I recommend the deluxe version (with the medals) as this makes the game much more fun and appealing (if not adding to the game-play as such).

Recommended for end-of-evening game groupings or for family/Christmas play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Thought I would like it more, as a fan of Coloretto and Medici.  There seemed to be fewer choices than I thought there would be.  A very tightly constrained system.  Not without its charms, though.  I do look forward to trying it again.

Plus, I love the art...but it's busy to the point of obstructing play.  I hate to say that, as the art is gorgeous, but some of the animals are hard to recognize upside-down.  And it's damned important to the game.  I understand that you can play the game by the backgrounds alone, but why should I?

This one will clearly take some more investigation.  There seems to be a decent amount of strategy in when to take cards and when to let them go.  It just seems so hard to balance slowing down your opponents with helping yourself.

We found it somewhat frustrating that there weren't enough medals for a 6 player game.  Still the gameplay was pretty fast once everyone knew what they were doing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One playing.  Cute and light. A light filler card game about showing and breeding animals which is apparently hard to find. It's a little similar to [i][gameid=46][/i] in that the dealer can choose to take cards he turns over or pass them around the table. It's fun, but not great.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Filler game.  The primary game mechanic is very similar to Medici and somewhat similar to Coloretto.  Not good for 3 players since you need a bunch of players to absorb the colors that nobody wants.  Feels unfinished with 3 players... imagine Coloretto with the same 7-10 colors of cards but only 3 rounds of collecting cards... naturally, luck prevails, and you're probably gonna get stuck with one of each color and few points.

A fantastic set collection game, it plays quickly, easily and has enough twists to keep it interesting.  also great as a 2 player game.

I love the various aspects to this game.  The Stars make some animals worth bidding on even if they aren't the animals you want to collect - and the two reasons for bidding, or the two stages to each bidding round - of winning the Glamour prize, and subsequently winning the medals.  The fact that the glamour prize can then have an impact on the medal part of the game is really very neat.

This is an extremely simple set collection card game, but one I absolutely adore.  The card art is fantastic too!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Tries to be something like medici but doesn't quite get there.  Not sure why entirely, but I don't find this game very engaging.   You really don't have many choices to make, and with all of the monkey cards it can really become a game where you have almost no control over your final score.

I actually ended up liking this more than I thought I would, based on my initial understanding of the rules.  The meta-play of trying to get groups of five medals by the end makes the last turn much more interesting than the first.  Still, there aren't a whole lot of choices to make, and most of them seem fairly obvious.  I can't get overly excited.  But it is a pleasant surprise.

This is an interesting little card game that focuses on set collection and drafting.  The game is easy enough that I would consider it a good gateway game to use before more complex card games.  Unless you're in the realm of CCG's, I tend to find card games artwork lacking, but that certainly isn't the case regarding this one.  There are a bunch of cards games that I would rather play than this, but there are definitely some redeeming factors which makes it worth a spot in most people's collections.

The actions are simple (the only thing not explained well is the Owl). The gameplay is good and we had a lot of nice chatter. The graphics are curiously disturbing, which we also liked. Another good simple set collecting card game. Ticked all the boxes for me.

Playing with my kids, it's more enjoyable, but I still don't care for the artwork and it's still pretty random. But I see it as a primer for Medici, and for that I have to say that I enjoy playing it with my kids. Up to a 7.

Animalia is mostly a game of probabilistic evaluation. After the first round, don't pay too much attention to the star count as the pay off is less and less worth the trouble. Focus instead on completing gold medals. The game mechanic allows for lots of entropy from other players and special card powers. There's an interesting strategy element in the choice of which animals to collect. The illustrations are pretty but confusing at times and the theme feels tacked on.

A fun, easy filler with considerable visual appeal.  Although at first I found the artwork busy and confusing, this seems very much a minority view.  Familiarity with the deck has overcome my difficulty.  The game plays somewhat like Medici without the bidding and math.  I expect children especially will enjoy the animals.  Because the cards are so large, this is suitable for people with limited vision.  Will accommodate 6 players if no one is allowed to hold more than one bonus card between rounds.  I own the deluxe version with the medals - expensive, but good value for the money.  I expect to wear out at least one copy.

Kind of fun and sure looks good, but the rules aren't quite complete (the game broke a bit in the end when we ran out of medals and the rules failed to cover the situation).

Pleasant, lightweight set collection game in a similar style to Coloretto but with less tactics (increased in the variant for two players). Each round cards circle around the table waiting to be grabbed by players - after all of them have filled up a hand of five cards the players with the highest total value can improve their hands and then get "medals" for large sets. Since games only last three rounds there isn't much of an arc unless the game is played by five or six players.

Wonderful! A great 2-6 player game! The artwork and components are really fun! It is a simple quick filler type game with some luck and strategy combined! The mechanics of the game run smoothly; super game play and quality always from Game Works!

The goal is to complete sets of matching animals to earn medals! You earn one medal for every animal in sets of 2 or more matching animal types. There are special cards to give you a one time temporary power and if you collect the most star quality animals you will gain cards for use in completing sets!

Splendid mesh of Medici and Coloretto.  I wish this was more readily available - as a quick filler or family game, this is outstanding, in no small part due to the gorgeous artwork.

This combination of unexceptional gameplay (which I'm not convinced works) and repulsive girly graphics should result in a low rating, but for some reason I'm holding off marking this down until it's seen further play.

I'm really enjoying this as a 20-30 minute filler.  This is also the most beautiful game we brought back from Essen, with truly charming artwork on each of the uniquely illustrated cards (no two alike!).

Cute filler card game.  The art is interesting but not so functional, as it's hard to tell some of the weird animals apart, and some of the color pairs look the same in dim light.

--July2008-- Thanks, Gareth!  My younger children (8 and 6) found the game quite delightful.  We all enjoyed the art, and the gameplay was well within the little ones' capabilities.  I expect they'll ask for it again.

This gorgeous card game turned out to be an average set collector.  Each player has the opportunity to collect sets of several different animals in thier hand of 5 cards.
With so many different animals in the deck, I think that the limit of 5 cards for collection reduces the effectiveness of playing for more than one or two animals period.
Overall I would give this game a 4, but the art is so attractive I can see myself playing it again just to stufy the art.

Kellemes meglepetes a jatek. Amellett, hogy szep meg nagyon is jo. Hasonlit egy kicsit a medici-re (itt is 5-os kollekciokat kell osszegyujteni), hasonlit egy kicsit az utolso Esseni kiallitason kiprobalt Easy School-ra ahol a jatekos lapokat csap fel es az o dontese, hogy mikor all meg. Rogton ket partit is lejatszottunk, mert a csapatnak tetszett a jatek.

Super light filler.  Not a lot of tough decisions, but some good player interaction if the right cards come up.  Also, the cards are well illustrated and the medals are made of thick cardboard.

Animalia -- 

I really like the feel of Mathieu Leyssenne's artwork, though I do think that in this case it is so stylized that sometimes it actually interfered with quick recognition of the key features of the cards. Nonetheless, it's worth it. The silly beauty of the cards helps establish an appropriately light tone for play.

Animalia is a rather haphazard filler I'll gladly play if someone requests it. Based on gameplay, I wouldn't bother to buy it, but I must admit that the artwork tempts me.

The deck of cards has VERY cute illustrations of a variety of animals on one of 5 colored backgrounds. On your turn, you draw a card then decide to keep it (add to your collection; 5 card max) or send it around. Other players may keep, or pass. If it makes it back to you, you draw again and repeat the process. Only caveat: if you don't have enough room in your display to accept the card(s) if everyone passed, you must add to your display: for example, if you have 3 cards in your display, you couldn't draw a 3rd card and send a set of 3 around -- would have to accept the 2 cards you draw first. There are 3 special cards that you may activate if you have a pair (in any color) in your display: thief (steal 1 card from another player's display), prankster (donate 1 of your cards to another player whose display is not full), and spy (look at top 5 cards and replace in any order). When everyone has their 5 cards, there's a beauty contest: whoever has the greatest beauty (sum of stars on cards less 'ugly' marks on cards) gets to draw 2 extra cards; 2nd place draws 1. These players may replace cards in their display with these cards, or hold them for future rounds. Then reward VP tokens: get 1 chit of the animal color for each animal in a pair, trip, quad, of quint. Also, if you have 5 diff animals, get 1 chit of each color. Play 3 rounds. For final scoring, get bonus  5VP chit for every set of 5 like-colored tokens. Most VP wins.

After first hearing the rules the game didn't sound all that great. But it turned out to be kind of fun. The cards are, of course, very well done; the scoring chips, too. The special powers are not overpowered and end up being fun to use. The beauty contest is cute, too. The game played in about 15 minutes, I think: a cute filler.

A poor man's Medici.  Still fun, as anything resembling Medici can't be too bad.  The bidding aspect is missed here and replaced by mechanics that are more luck-driven.  There aren't as many interesting choices here, so it's not one to be taken seriously.  Would be interesting to see how well children like it.  I can see that going either way.

[GameWorks SaRL Deluxe 06 edition] {Animals, filler; set collection, card-passing; optimal 4p} Animalia is an attractive and excellent family card game. It's easy to teach and learn. It's fast-paced and short (10-15 minutes per game). It has moderate player interaction and nastiness (using the utility cards and during card passing).  Replayability is quite good due to the card draw randomness. Animalia should be in every collector's collection but it's hard to find and is expensive.  

Nonetheless, the game isn't that fun for 5-6 players: long down time, not enough award medals and not enough cards for distributing bonus. Avoid playing it with 5-6 players even though the box states so.

The trivial strategy is to build up one or two families of animal to score high scores.  Nonetheless, players have several considerations when collecting the cards: going elegance points for bonus cards, collecting function cards to trigger special actions, gathering animals from a same family for points, etc.  Since bonus cards can be kept over seasons, collecting bonus cards is a viable strategy at early game to increase flexibility and/or potential gains. 

The illustration is ravishing, esp. to animal lovers. The medal awards are thick and sturdy.  The printing quality of cards is very high. The overall design of the game is very good.

This is a great try from first-time designer, Malcolm.  Keep up the good work.

One of the benefits of hitting the game table hard for a 100 x 1 challenge is hitting the unplayed list too. I was able to get this game in a trade several years ago. I was interested based on the artwork (it really is great) and set-collection. But this game really would play better with more players. So off the unplayed list and on to the trade list.

A member of our gaming group came back with this game from Switzerland and I had the opportunity to play it.  It is a relatively simple game of trying to create sets of colors with some of the cards (if you get a SET of powers) allowing you to trade cards around.  For playing with kids I think this game is fantastic.  The art is beautiful.

This game feels like it was designed for a Swiss insurance agency. It really was? Well, that explains things! The idea is clever enough - a bidding and set collection game where the cards have special powers when acquired in pairs - but the theme is bizarre and the artwork didn't grab me as much as it apparently has some other folks. Biggest flaw here is that luck plays the dominant role. Some surface resemblance to Medici in the mechanics, but nobody will confuse this fluffy, flawed filler for Knizia's auction classic.

As a promotional item, Animalia blows the doors of anything similar (Horse Show?).  Appropriately, no new ground gets broken here and the gameplay is comfortably familiar.  "Medici meets Lost Cities" is a common and accurate statement.  The art is the star and it is lush, immersive, and charming.  Consider Animalia as a rainbow amongst terrain-bound card games.

Short, fun card game for 2-6.  Scores can be really tight in our games, so going for a perfect (or near perfect) score is always our goal.  The special powers are interesting, particularly with lower player counts.  Great artwork and quick gameplay make for an excellent gateway game for adults or children.

I just love the artwork in Animalia, so it's disheartening to put this down as a disappointment. I thought it would be more fun that it was. Several things were disappointing, not enough activating of the special powers, as you have to have two cards before you can use one. So many times we'd get one, but not two, since you only get five cards total.

It also seemed wrong that one of the hardest things to do in the game was to collect a set of all five possible colours, yet points-wise this isn't very smart to do, since it basically makes getting the +5 bonus points impossible at game end.

The game I traded for to get my animal loving non-gamer daughter to play games.  Success!  Actually, it is quite an enjoyable game.  I think it is probably best for two, as two "shows" gives you many more options and makes the game a bit more strategic.

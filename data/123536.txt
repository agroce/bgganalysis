I don't understand the love for this game, to me it feels massively snowbally and very frustrating to be on the wrong end of the avalanche. Perhaps with more plays the game will show more depth to me... I have seen people speak of drafting opening hands, which may also be worthwhile...

Games can snowball pretty hard, but other than this rare occurrence, this is a great little competitive party game. I also knocked off a point because I felt like having the cards no longer say their actual abilities was a little time consuming for us the first.. 5 games or so. Could have been easier to jump into with some text.

A lot of great strategy packed in this little game. I like how the effects can trigger and a player can play awesome combos that way. The timing was fiddly, this game never played smooth for me.

So so game, I have other games I would rather play instead.
Out of my collection.

While I like this, I would rather play the original game with some of the concepts from Gosu 2.  Here are the changes I use when playing Gosu:

-With newbies, instead of drafting, we draw 10 and simultaneously choose 7, discarding the other 3. This is a Gosu 2 rule. With experienced players, I'll still draft as per the original rules though.

-After a player passes opponents only get 3 turns until the Great Battle happens. Any extra turns opponents get through card effects do not go against the 3 turn limit. This is a Gosu 2 rule. The original Gosu rules allowed for unlimited turns and the revised rules allowed for 10 extra turns. 3 adds a nice tension to the rounds.

-When playing cards/activating a goblin, abilities are never modified by what's in the parenthesis. This is my own made up rule that just makes the game a lot better and not devolving losing to win. I also think it also better balances some of the goblins.

-After a Great Battle, each player draws up to 7 cards minus the number of VP they have. This is a Gosu 2 rule. This works better as a catch-up mechanism as it's not so overwhelmingly good.

---

Why do I prefer Gosu 1 over Gosu 2?  There is more variety of goblin abilities in Gosu 1.  There is more variety in the awesome artwork in Gosu 1.  I like having to manage activation tokens in Gosu 1.  I'm not fussy on the shininess of cards, especially the game play icons of Gosu 2.  There are more types of 'instant win' conditions in Gosu 1.  There are some other theories but would actually have to play to play Gosu 2 more.  Gosu 2 is still a good game.

I didn't understand how a such a small box could have gotten all the praise it did, but after playing a couple times, it's surprisingly deep; it reminds me of Small World in ways. Proper use of chain and mutation abilities seem to be absolutely key, especially after the first wave, when you have a pile of goblins out and need to make room for more. Good plays can net you handfuls of cards, extra turns, and so on, sometimes all at once. Definitely dig it.

Nem feltétlenül az én világom az egymást gyakós, leginkább kétfős kártyajáték (lcg, ccg style), mert valamiért mindig frusztrálnak ezek, komolyabban veszem őket, mint amennyire kéne. Talán itt is ez volt a baj, de emiatt nem is igazán jött be. Szerintem messze nincsenek kiegyensúlyozva a lapok, mert csak laphúzásra kell menni, minden más gyakorlatilag értelmetlen mellette. De hogy abból mennyit kapsz, már full random. Ugyanígy a 9 lapos hirtelen győzelmet is csak hatalmas mákkal van esélyed behúzni. A grafikák gyönyörűek, de az olvashatóság botrányos. A kis nyilakért nagyon durva büntetést tudnék kiosztani a designernek és a tüzes/nem tüzes képességek is átláthatatlanok. 

Az mondjuk azért valahol lenyűgöző hogy ilyen egyszerű szabályokból milyen sokrétű játékot sikerült összerakni. Biztosan megvan a célközönsége.

It's pretty decent, but chained turns take too long to play this with more than two people, and the graphics, while very pretty, make the cards a bit difficult to use (some clans are very hard to tell apart in poor lighting, the levels being on the right side make it hard to hold more than a few cards in your hand and still being able to see all the relevant info about them, etc.

Still fun and recommended, however.

Fun as a light two player game.  I've not played with three, but as a four player game it's absolutely awful.  Not enough cards available.  Too much down time.  Potential for game to drag on and on and on.

This is a pretty cool hand management game not to be overlooked. I like that the first to win three rounds wins the game as well as the two instant win conditions on top of that. It makes you have to watch what your opponents are doing at all times and try to stop them if possible. The only thing holding this game back from being great is luck of the draw. All in all, it's a fun, unique game, that plays quickly, and offers some good choices. And the foil cards just look super cool!

Strategy card game that my ex-GR truly hated- the squinty text, the bizarre foiling process that made all of the cards unreadable at certain angels, demonic imp art, weird iconographic symbols everywhere....this all added up to make her ragequit quite spectacularly. 

Had a few games with friends and we got out some crazy combos so maybe it's worth the money if you like MTG style card games.

Fun little tactical card game that was as gift from a /u/Topheth. Great art and easy gameplay shadows over the iconography in this game and it really scratches my deckbuilding itches. For now.

GOSU 2: Tactics plays like a hybrid of Race for the Galaxy and Magic: The Gathering with each player trying to recruit an army of goblins made up of soldiers, heroes, magicians, and other classes – then swing it into action against the other players. Five clans of goblins are represented on the game cards, with goblins in one of three ranks. To build an army, a player must first recruit level I goblins, then build on those goblins with level II and finally level III. Those higher level goblins can be played only if a lower level goblin is of the same clan, and since goblins of the same clan have similar abilities or powers that mesh well, players tend to specialize in who they recruit to their ranks

I have played the mess out of this game, and I must say that it is best played with 2 players. Three players is alright, but four players adds a bit too much randomness and waiting time between turns. Two players is the most tactical version of this game and I really appreciate that. I love the engine building aspect of this game. It's amazing how much can be done in one turn late game. I have really enjoyed this game and will continue to into the future.

The original Gosu was a good game with a few blips (a few overpowered cards and the chits). Kamakor (the expansion) made the game even better. With Gosu 2,the game has been streamlined with the elimination of all of the text. Once the icons have been learned, the game requires 15 to 30 minutes to play. In addition to that, there is the new 'link' mechanic that adds considerable depth to the game. Of the two games (Gosu or Gosu Tactics) the original game is a much tougher game and is much less forgiving but it is the deeper of the two games.

Is it better than Magic or Summoner Wars or Thunderstone? In my opinion it is as there are only 85 cards in the game and there are 3 each of the low level cards. of course this reduces the variety but increases a player's grasp of what is possible. I enjoy that aspect however, I fully understand those players that prefer the variety that the other games mentioned offer. The point is that I believe Gosu 2 to be equal in play quality to those other games mentioned above.

Definitely an improvement on the Original. The cards are streamlined, almost to a fault, by turning everything into an icon. So up front by looking at the reference page in the rules you know exactly what all of the abilities on the cards will be. It changes the counter-intuitive parts of the original to be more like what a new player would expect (refresh your hand each round, "more powerful if you're losing" abilities are gone), which is both disappointing and good. However, death mutation still exists and is exactly the same problem as it was before. There's less complexity to the cards in general, though, so that helps.

It's ok.  Pretty light with colorful art.  But, you don't have much control at all.  It feels like whoever can draw the right level 3 cards will win.  (It's slightly more complex than that, but it's more tactical than strategic).

It's not very often you see a tableau game that's in-your-face, dirty fighting. But it's goblins, so it makes sense! A nice blend of a bit of luck, a generous heaping of strategy, and a whole LOT of tactics (the name is fitting!).

Feels like a more strategic Manhattan.  Dual use of cards (used to play or to save for auctioning) adds a tough decision-making element to the game.  Scales very nicely from 2-4.  Surprising that an English version was never made for this game, but really not a language dependent game anyways.

Wow... I have been having really good luck with games that I just love lately. The building mechanic works so well with the area control and the auction is just icing on the cake. I must really like these Moon & Weissblum board games, which is funny because their Employee of the Month is one of the worst games I've ever played. Anyway, I would happily play Capitol a few times in a row. For now it is at the top of my 'to play' list.

RATING: 7
Early days - I've only played this twice (3 player and 4 player) so far.  It's better with 4.  It's essentially an abstract game, but like all of Alan Moon's games, it's pretty elegant in that it works very well, with some depth, in a pretty simple design.  

There's a fair bit of brain-burning, but the way the cards come up in the draw can have a huge effect as well.  I also think that the amphitheatres are very powerful.  

There's a lot of take that in it, and at times this can make what you do rather telegraphed and you find yourself not wanting to play in an area where you know that it will ultimately profit someone else a lot more than yourself - but I guess that typically Euro - it's just a bit more obvious here.

I think Patrician has partly built on this, but that's a much quicker game.  Also, some people have compared the game to El Grande and San Marco, but I don't think it's as good as either of those two - having said that, in this game, you can only add to your areas and cannot remove others from them.  Some gamers may prefer that less aggressive mechanism.

Very interesting building game. Wonderful build-or-bid mechanism  with the cards provides for plenty of tough choices. The need to keep track of other players off-board building as well as keep up with the on-board events means there is plenty to keep your brain busy. Be sure to use the varient of shuffling the discard piles when the card stacks run out.

first off, i've read the stuff about the horrible scoring track, and it managed to exceed expectations.  wow, that thing sucks!  the game itself wasn't bad, i like building games like alhambra, palazzo, etc and with the static board-based development it does kinda feel as if a city is being constructed.  the mechanics mostly function, although i don't see why the auctions aren't a simple under the table blind bid.  discrete resources don't bug me, but i'd like to have a little more control over things when they're that present.  huge non-fan of the unshuffled decks, not sure what that adds.  overall i'd play it again, but i'd much rather play the other two games i mentioned.

Good 90 minute game.  Very nice bits.  I like the card auction mechanic.  In the last round you need to be very careful planning which cards you need.

Like many area control games try to avoid spending lots of resources on pitched battles for specific areas.  A good tactic is to buy fountains to fill up the available spaces.

One of the few unique Moon designs.  Original and ingenious mechanisms, tense and relatively simple, it also ends at exactly the right time.  An interesting twist on the area majorities genre with the relative strength of second place.  I also like the face up draw decks, an elegant mitigation of luck.  However, as others have commented, while the game works, nothing truly sets it apart and the theme is a disgraceful (and no, an uterly worthless scoring track made of pillars doesn't constitute theme).  A disposable, generic Euro before that became the norm.

Alan Moon sent this to me personally (I should have had him autograph it...drats!)  It was out of my hands for a few years, while I was having one of CCG Workshop's Project Leads work on an online version, but I'm very happy to have it back.

Game play is very nice.  The blind bidding works well.  You have only 4 rounds to construct your houses and bid on improvements for the city.  

One of Moon's best designs, although the score marker is shite.  Skyline 3000 doesn't hold a candle to this, and I don't foresee ever removing this from my collection.

Capitol is basically a huge game of chicken!  You're always waiting on someone else to go first so you can capitalize on their placements.  This makes for some pretty good angst.

Also cool is that you either use your cards to build stuff, or to bid on stuff later, making for some difficult decisions!

Clever little game of building Buildings and then getting the right permit to influence the scoring on the board. But make sure you have the right roof on your building and it is the right height to place onto the board. Then don't forget to save some good high value cards to bid succesfully in the auction for temples, amphitheatres and fountains which can help you on your way to victory. 1 Play.

After 1 3-player game

I like this game.  I think it is a little too simple, and this simplicity shows its flaws.  The card drawing should be really interesting, but it never seemed like it was near as interesting as the ability to draw more cards.  Also, like most tactical games, it has that "whoever gets messed with the least will be the winner" thing going on.  I think it would be better with 4.  More competition and more sharing which is what makes this game interesting.

RATING: 6
Pleasant abstract area control game that looks very cool. The rewards for performing actions diminish from turn to turn and players can lodge themselves in good spots were they can't be deposed. This leads to a run away leader problem. The blind bidding is very random because it is virtually impossible to predict how much the fountains and amphitheatres will be worth to each player. Enjoyable and the cards as actions or money for bidding is interesting.

RATING: 8
The amount of pieces and types of cards in this game makes it seem like it would be confusing.  However, once you get the game set-up, the play comes naturally.  We play it 2-player, which works fine, and it seems like it would be even better with more.  You could memorize what cards your opponent has, and really over-analyze this game, but we play it quickly.  The wooden blocks are wonderful and look great when you're done.

RATING: 3
As in many Alan Moon games, luck plays a significant factor, but the game is a pleasant mix of strategy and tactics with some really nice look-ahead planning aspects.  Unfortunately all of that hangs on a who-bites-first tension combines with faux hand management.

Rating promoted by .5 for the simple fact that while I don't think this is a bad game, it is a game that I like far less than it seems to warrant.

Rating dropped 1.5 due to simple lack of reason to ever want to play it.  It isn't an actually bad game but it lacks both charm and attraction.

RATING: 5
Probably the most gamer friendly Alan Moon game I've played to date. The basic idea of the game is quite simple, and yet the smallest rules, which are easy to overlook when you first read the booklet, make for all of the insanity in this title. For example, the ,,you may build another building equal in height or 1 block taller than the current highest one in the district" aspect which makes it very tricky to judge how tall you should make your buildings before capping them (as buildings are constructed off-board, and then dropped (wheeled?) in), too low and they're useless, too high and it will be the same result, wasted cards and a lot of used up blocks. The 2 different roof types and the rules associated with said roofs also causes considerably more agony than I thought they would when I first read about it, by the end of the game roof types are a serious squeeze on one's options, and again, make the decisions very hard. So with all of this positive why the 5 rating? Simply put, I think this is a good game, undoubtedly a quality offering, but it just has no spark for me. I don't "feel like a robot" as Morgan seems to while playing, yet, I don't feel any burning urge to trot it out either. It's adequate to receive the designation as a good game that I'm willing to play, and yet is nothing I would ever own or probably ever request. One minor niggling detail that has to do with the rules as well is that I dislike the vicious nature of the scoring, there is no built in incentive to take second place in most districts, which can make the game very all or nothing at times, a mechanic which similarly turned me off in Taj Mahal in a different way. That's not to say that there aren't situations where it is good to be in second, but I like a little more leeway in that regard in games like this, and Capitol seems a little restrictive in that you're going to want to, in most cases, try and get a hard majority with a combination of towers and well placed fountains and get it sealed up as soon as possible because in at least half of the districts, if not more, the value for being in second is so miniscule that wasting your time is just that, a waste, even if someone does put down a doubler you still won't be getting very much while they rack up the bonus. Nice bits on this one, and I rather like the board art, but the scoring track is both visually appealing and useless as advertised.

I played this game once with another boardgaming enthusiast and several of his friends, but I had forgotten about the experience until I stumbled onto the pictures of this game. I cannot wholly remember the experience, save that we played with one or two rules wrong, and that I didn't like it much. There was some sort of bizarreness about it I didn't really enjoy. Alan Moon likes his luck, and while Aaron did a good job of mitigating it in the excellent San Marco, it didn't prove to be the case here. 

[b]Update[/b] Games have a way of turning up on the table sooner or later. And so it was that I found myself looking at this box again. This time all rules were adhered to. I found the game to be a lackluster one. There is a strong tendency of waiting for the other players to make a move so you can quickly claim a good area, but this requires a combination of all three cards; and if players get sucked into a building war they might find themselves stranded with unplaceable and/or subpar buildings as timing is very critical. In addition noone really wants to place the buildings of levels 1 and 2, as these are easily overbuilt. Placing these costs 2 cards at minimum (by choosing them from your starting supply), and in practice about 4 (one building from the supply, and the other constructed during the game). But with 4 cards I can also construct a 3 or 4 story-building, and that will at least come even with the pair of smaller buildings. So why bother beginning? You'll just be setting yourself up to be taken advantage of, and there is very little reward for stepping up like that. This game needs a variant to entice players to open new areas, in my opinion. 

Then there is the scarcity of cards. You only get to draw 6 new ones; if you're lucky a few more. If you go for stones you can't place the buildings. You need roofs too to place them. And you need permits too. But you cannot know in advance how the waiting game plays out, and what turns out to be a golden opportunity to claim a district may fail because you didn't foresee it while drawing cards a little earlier. On top of that, the cards serve as bidding strength. If someone by luck of the draw gets lots of high cards, he rules the roost and there's nothing you can do about it. There's simply too much multiplexing going on to make it interesting. Turn angst is nice and well, but it should serve a purpose, not be the driving force of a game.

The result is that Capitol doesn't really take off because the players don't really want to begin playing. A perfect incentive to leave the game in its box, therefore.

Another typical Moon/Weisblum game, in that it's interesting game to me at first, but then I see how much luck plays a roll in the game, and I'm suddenly less enamored of it.

I wasn't too enarmoured of the game with it feeling a bit 'same old blah' with the exception of tense escalation of building heights in front of the players (who'll be first to drop out and roof thier building?). Each of the four rounds requires careful planning before drawing your cards which can create some downtime if you're playing with an analyser. You can't afford to fall too far behind early in this game either since the card luck can make it hard to reign in a leader. Pack paper & pencil in the box... the score columns are rather delicate to operate.

Like El Grande in a lot of ways --- periodic scoring rounds in which the two players with the best presence in each of nine regions get points. It's much lighter and quicker than El Grande. El Grande may be 'perfectly designed' (Can, oh, about 1 million geeks all be wrong about that?), but I think Capitol is more fun.

This game sees players trying to build buildings in Ancient Rome. Building is a three step process, each step requiring a particular type of card - 1. build buildings with blocks; 2. put a roof of your colour on the building; 3. position the building into a "suburb" on the board. Majorities of blocks in each of the 9 suburbs earn VP's, with bonus points available for fountains. The cards drive the game - you need them for construction, and for auction afterwards to buy fountains (more points), ampitheatres (more cards) and temples (double points). Excellent game of managing meagre resources.

Just a bunch of mechanisms I don't like put together: area-majority "king of the hill" style, blind bidding, fiddly card-drawing.  I gave it three chances, but that was enough.

RATING: 2
Yet again Moon borrows from El Grande, and a heinous result is published. It is a dry, boring, procedural game which features blind bidding. It fails to be either fun or strategic. Furthermore, it is shockingly derivative of EL Grande, yet seems pale and hollowed -out in comparision. I'd rather spend an extra 30 minutes and really 'get it on' with El Grande than be unsatisfied by this flat and procedural tease of a game. 
 
The 3rd and final chapter of Moon's now-famous "Soulless Cyborg Games" trilogy, the others being Get the Goods and Andromeda.

Stacking buildings, saving cards for the auction, and planning what roofs to put on buildings are interesting. Your options seem limited in the later part of the game.

I enjoyed very much my first game of Capitol. I like the theme. Played a few more times and noticed that the replay value of Capitol was very low, so I traded it. 3-4 plays and you saw everything the game could offer. Scoring wise, it's the worse that I have ever seen. It was a disappointment.

Mix of strategy and luck. Beautiful bits.

Simple rules lead to engaging strategy decisions. Interesting tension between using cards for actions and using them as currency to buy improvements.  Careful planning for future rounds essential to victory.  Limited number of roofs available is significant -- avoid using all roofs of one kind too soon. Game includes trackable secret information: your opponents' hands. Best play requires remembering at least what colors of building permits other players hold.  I prefer the art and theme integration in the rethemed version Skyline 3000.

Only tried once. I loved the preparing the building early then placing it stuff. I did not like being completely shut out of my key areas by luck of the card draw. And there seems to be one super-region where the majority holders automatically win the game. Cool the way bidding is mixed in -- always a plus, I find.

RATING: 8
Two clever mechanisms in this game; the card deck is used for actions but also has values for bidding in the auction at the end of the round. Do I use the actions or save to bid for the bonus trophies? Secondly, the actual building mechanism, especially choosing when to put the roof on and commit yourself when other players have the chance to place before you and so waste your efforts is very clever. The game does have a notoriously bad scoring device, just write the scores on paper.

RATING: 7
This game has some interesting choices, but didn't seem to be as compelling as most people felt.  I've only played once, and it seems like a pretty good game - but just seemed to lack excitement.  While Clocktowers is quicker & lighter, I think this deisgn may actually work better as a less serious game.

Still, I'm giving this the benefit of the doubt until I have more games under my belt.  I liked the "hurry & build" vs. "stall & delay" tactic, and I also like the dual-use of the cards (bid vs. build).  Oh... and that scoring track is downright AWFUL!  It's too bad this is out of print, but give me San Marco anyday over this.  Grade: C

A difficult game to master, with good choices at every move. Balancing yourself between building and auctions is the key. There is some randomness, but since you can do two things with your cards it not bad at all. Personally, it's my favourite area majority game.

RATING: 6
As an area control game Capitol constrains the players quite a bit in where they may place their pieces. These constraints add an interesting tactical aspect to the game but they also increase the luck facor quite a bit since you may not always be able to get the cards you need for where you want to go. Nevertheless, it works quite well in general. The only real detractor is that stalling is a very real concern. Going first puts you in danger of being outbuilt right away and basically making your turn a waste of cards and building blocks. Going last can be very beneficial, and holding out longer than the other players is almost entirely a function of the number of cards in hand which is not very appealing.

One of the most underrated games. The card mechanism is purely excellent.

Simple rules but this is quite close to a brainburner. Very tense game.

A very enjoyable game on a steady table. It only takes one clumsy person to ruin the game, but otherwise it looks great and plays well. As already mentioned the scoring track is kinda finicky, but can be made to work better by glueing a strip of cardboard or something across the bottom. The game looks great and is fun to play, but I would say 4 player is the sweet spot as playing with 2 is kind of dull.

There is a lot to take into account as you are so limited with what you have to play and what you have to build.  There is the added difficulty of spending your cards to build or save them later for the auction round in the hopes of getting a nice temple or fountain of theater.  Update: Got whomped again!  If you let one player get two theaters, consider yourself doomed.  Ah well.  Having played this a second time, I am not quite sure what I think about it.  It has some interesting decisions, but I am not falling in love with this game.  I am not sure what it is that is preventing me from really liking this game.  It is a good game, but I am not a hundred percent sure it is one I need to keep.

Update: After playing it 3 times now, I can say this just isn't one for me.  It's not a bad game by any means and it is quite clever, but I am ok with not owning it anymore.

Very nice and solid, while a bit dry. The bits are great. I really enjoy playing it.

The one thing that I don't like concerns the restriction on placement of buildings based on the colour of the placement cards. It is quite possible (as also happened for two of the players in my game) that a player must draw almost all of his cards from one stack just to get one in the colour that he seeks. This potentially devastating predicament due to the luck of the draw stems from what seems to be a dramatic departure in the design from an otherwise strategic and tactical composition that rewards some elements of planning. Perhaps intentional to make the game less "dry", but too random for my own taste.

First play and I liked this, area control or is it area influence? limited actions to how many cards and what type of cards you have. You choose which cards to refresh and weither to keep them for the auction or use them to build. Long term strategies are difficult but good play is nearly always available. Alot of reflective play with limited resources - reminds of mexica crossed with PoF. I need to play this a bit more and try it with four players. The game has too many kingmaker situations for me to love this game but I certainly rate it.

Smart, well-designed game in the "area control" genre.  However, unlike El Grande or San Marco, placing second in many regions often is not a winning strategy.  The balance between using "card resources" for construction and auction is terrific.

The components are fabulous, and the game is very attractive.  The scoring track, while visually striking, is not the most practical - too easy to bump and lose the scores.  [We just keep score on paper.]

RATING: 6
Area influence:auctions:city building:hand management

Too bad really, this could of been much better as maybe I'm being a tad generous with my rating here. Moon borrows heavily from Seyfarth's Manhattan but forgets to improve it in the most required area, LUCK. 

The biggest problem is indeed the luck, some placements are critical at the right times similiar to Manhatten and in the same fashion as that game, if you don't get the card for that area you can be potentially ruined or locked out of a key scoring area. Speaking of scoring I'm not sure I like how it is allocated here so I might try to tweak it and update accordingly. 

There are some good aspects here, decisions are tough at times and I find myself wanting to 'wait' and see what happens before I commit to things but that is not possible. The auction isn't bad and having to save your building cards to use in the auction makes the hand management much tougher. Simple to learn and a good game length are other positives. Components are great but that scoring track, sheeshh, novel idea but they didn't fully CAPITOLize on it as the design is virtually unfinished and flawed. :P

For a building game with luck I prefer Manhattan as the fun level is much higher than here. See "Big City" for a Strategic Building game...

UPDATE: 7 => 6 No table time as its just not that good, average at best so why play an average game when much better ones are around

Aug11/2007, played 4 players and enjoyed it just as much... of course my almost land slide win helps with that.

Update: Played a second game with four players. While better than with two and a game I would consider playing if asked, it's probably not a game I will suggest. Interestingly the second game ended with a three-way tie(!), with the fourth place just a few points behind.

Capitol is so 2001 but that's not a bad thing. Its two main components area control and auctions are out of fashion but they were popular once and there's no reason why such a game shouldn't be worthwile playing in 2013 anymore. Inherently, there's a heavy dose of conflict as players vie for control of the 9 prefectures. It's a game of forcing other players to commit first through efficient usage of one's own resources to have the last word in majority decisions. As usual for this type of game, players have to choose their battles wisely as the key to victory is investing low for second place and win where you invest highly. The minor details such as three "currencies" and two different shapes of roofs add enough decision space for allowing clever moves. Still a good game today, although play numbers show that Capitol has fallen from grace more than other comparable games from this period such as San Marco or Taj Mahal.
Trivia: The card draw mechanism was recycled in Fifth Avenue, the bidding mechanism in Merry Men of Sherwood.

A fairly simple building game, slightly reminiscent of Manhattan, with its different neighborhoods, growing buildings and restrictive placement.  There is a good amount of tension as the game progresses and it really is important to plan ahead.  Ridiculous scoring columns are kind of silly, and the bidding mechanism (with the "stop" card) doesn't make too much sense. 

Traded away, then reacquired in a math trade.

A very abstract city-building game. Its a very simple game with a good dose of luck and was quite enjoyable to play. Unfortunately there just isn't enough here that the game feels complete. It seems to be more of a filler than anything. A very light filler game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's sad that a game of this caliber is often best remembered for one of the most impractical scoring tracks ever. The game is an elegant mix of area control, hand management, bluffing and auctions. Lots of tactics included and filled with agonizing decisions, the game is unfortunately a bit prone to AP at times and luck around drawing the district cards might be deciding factor sometimes.

I bought this game a while ago and only recently got to play it.  It is a really neat and clever Area Majority game.  There is a lot to think about and you really have to play a balancing act in terms of using your cards to put more buildings on the board and keeping enough cards to win in the auction phase.  I'll have to play it more but it seems like a really neat game.

The more I play it, the more I love the balance of power. You&#039;re goal is to build buildings within zones. Most floors within a zone scores first for it (like in El Grande). The game is played in four rounds and at the end of each round is a bidding phase where you bid for fountains, amphitheaters and temples which give you points and cards.

Fun. I lead for the first 3 rounds with a small building policy but lost out in the last round due my small building policy. Needed to win more cards to allow me to fight with taller buildings int he 3 and 4th rounds.

Don't let some of the minor score track comments deter you from grabbing this one.  A great, and IMO underrated, 3-D building game.  It has my favorite game mechanic of dual-use cards (do you spend to build or save to bid on auctions?).  How do you use your cards?  How high do you build?  Which cards do you pickup?  IMO, works best with four plyrs.

Some of the gameplay seemed a bit odd and counter-intuitive. That said, it only lasts for 4 rounds so doesn't overstay its welcome. I do like that the cards you use to bid with are the same that you need for the actions. This allows for some difficult decisions regarding whether to build or hold off for the bidding round. The blind-bidding mechanism was clever (using the player's cards) but is seemed very misplaced. Why not use a regular action mechanic?

In short, I would play it again.

In 2004, Tom Vassel wrote: "The game is not quite as fun as Manhattan, but is probably a better-designed game, with more opportunities for strategy." 

Based on this one comment, it might be worth putting off purchasing (even at the $33.50 Funagain Games price on 4/28/10 NB: BGG Marketplace had it for $25 on 01/31/10) until Manhattan gets more game play. Another critic commented, "Its an 'okay' game with nothing that really stands out except it's faults, there are just so many better majority games that this one never gets suggested by anyone I know."

Also, BGG Marketplace is routinely selling copies of this for $30 (although shipping will be a fortune). I'm guessing this is because of Zman's Skyline 3000 re-implementation of the game (at a sticker price of around $50). NB: On 12/31/10 Tanga was selling Skyline for $20 plus $7 shipping. 

Comments on Skyline (which has nice neon colors): http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/502181/appolus-game-reviews-skyline-3000-glorified-buil

NB: Some like it and some don't. Although it looks really nice, it's probably not worth getting considering all the unplayed games that we currently have.

See the following review which makes comparisons between this and Manhattan: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/130753/capitol-my-view

NB: Scoring mechanism has been criticized by some as being faulty and/or altogether broken.

My wife agreed to learn a new game tonight, but said that she only had one hour available.  When I suggested Capitol, she was skeptical that we could learn it and play it in an hour -- but we did! This is an easy game to explain, but seems to have several strategy layers that are only apparent after playing the game through once.  The 4th round is especially tense!

Very typical of Moon and Weissblum, there are many factors that balance each other.  The numbers on the cards vs. the function, the three types of cards, the three regions, the roof types and region placement limitations, etc.  But, also typical of Moon and Weissblum, it lacks enough control and informed decisions to for me to really get into it.  Still, it is better than Oasis.  Oh, and the scoring track is very fiddly.

The few times we've played [i]Capitol[/i] its been enjoyable, but for some reason we haven't felt the urge to play often. It works well with three players; might play with four, wouldn't play with two.

The rule for drawing cards at the end of the rounds--each player draws all six of his/her cards at once from three faceup piles--is very unusual and interesting. On the other hand, it's odd the way the buildings are constructed off the board. Speaking of the board, it and the building pieces are very attractive with the exception of the temples and amphitheaters, which unfortunately were done on the cheap. With a strip of cardboard taped underneath the holder, the much maligned scoring columns function quite well. [3 plays; sold]

You'd think I would like this but for some reason this game has no soul for me.  Too sparse, "sneaky" and short for me.....don't care much for this type of outpositioning game and the theme and mechanics are just like so many other games, it does very little for me.  Feel the card draw aspect is flawed in that you can't get permits for certain zones often and you have too little control over what you are doing.  Additionally, I don't care for the mechanism where the early leaders/winners get even more cards making it even harder for those that had poor card draw early.  Never been much of a fan for blind bidding either.  The mechanics just don't meld together for me and I don't really feel an "enjoyment" or "fascination" from the game play and feel which is present in so many of my favorite games.   Not sure I will play again.

In this area control game, there are three decks of cards: cards for getting building blocks, cards for capping the blocks as a building, and cards to put the building in an area. Play over four rounds, and before each round ends, bid cards to earn special bonus amphitheatres, fountains or temples. Then restock cards for next round in player order. It's a decent area control game and fairly easy to pick up. Near the end, some of your plays may become scripted or it may become a waiting game to see who puts their buildings on first, so you can parachute your buildigns on later. It can be a cruel game if you end up not scoring with your buildings.

Area majority, this time with building stones. Timing of finishing your own buildings with round or square top is important in winning majority, and requires holding up to be able to see what your opponents do.

This game has a very nice balance between the "placement" of your buildings and the auction bidding that is required for the "special" buildings. The building restrictions make for difficult decisions when using "permit" cards and the dual use of the cards for building (floors, roofs and using permits) and bidding adds a not uncommon twist, but another twist to already difficult decisions. The use of "face up" card stacks is a feature not often seen and adds a nice flavor to act of "drawing cards". Quality "bits and pieces" round out a very nice game. The game also plays well for 2 players. I give this one 8 for playability et al and another .5 for the unique nuiances and mechanics.  Bottom line ... money well spent IMHO.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Tactical game. Slight random element which can really mess your game up through no fault of your own.  There are 3 regions in which to build houses and you can only build in a region if you have the right coloured card. If you draw a number of cards and they are all the same colour, then you're pretty screwed if you wanted to build somewhere else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I love it when a game has a piece that serves several roles.  The cards in this are specific to an action type but are also used during the bidding so you have to carefully balance these aspects.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Because you're so restricted each round as to where to play (self-imposed, but none-the-less), it's easy for one player to inadvertantly get left to their own devices, score big, and prove impossible to catch up with only a limited number of buildings to whack them with in the final rounds. And even then maybe you can't based on the zonal cards that emerge, the roof types you have left, and the competition forced on you by the other players. So to have a good game, you need equally skilled players who are all prepared to put in the same effort (ie are all watching the cards pulled like hawks, thinking through the ramifications, ensuring competition is shared amongst all the players). And that doesn't happen too often, leading me to believe the game is fragile. Traded away.

Looking forward to trying this, picked it up used for a premium at Funagain recently (Dec '05). 12/20 Okay, played solitare, and it reminds me of Hansa in it's scope, pace and tempo. Not really anything like Hansa, mind you, it's an area control game with an interesting building aspect, and auction mechanism. It might break this out to see what interest area-control has in a group - those that get hooked will probably migrate to El Grande next. Too bad Capitol is OOP. 1/9/06 Played it three times against my adult family group, and it was great. Each player got better each game, final game scoring was something like 42-40-38-36. Dad and brother said it was something like a "perfect" game, in that they could think of nothing to improve the tempo, pieces, rules, scope, mechanics, even theme. (I didn't let them use the scoring device.) It took me three years to find my copy (Funagain). Good game.

As I'm exposed to more games, I'm beginning to find some versions of mechanics that I enjoy more than others, and Capitol falls through the cracks.  It has some interesting mechanics, but the build and control the area motif feels more fun with Torres than this one.  Had I experienced this one first, it may be rated higher, but for area control I like El Grande and San Marco, and for building I like Torres.

1 play 30 minutes + 15 min / player

Starts out very light but gets deeper as players commit to specific areas of the city. The dynamic of reusing the cards in the order they're played allows for uniform distribution preventing folks from feeling greatly constrained by a build card's color not matching a desired location - just the right amount to require some tactics in amongst the strategic back and forth. As the game progressed, I liked it more and more.

Rated on the basis of three plays. The first play was a two-player game, and I have to recommend against this for just two players. With two, too many moves have the same benefit for both players and the decisions are not very interesting. But with three, the game comes alive. I would guess that four is the sweet spot.

Capitol has an elegant design in which you can watch your opponents building up structures before they are placed on the board. You can make some very interesting deductions from the state of those half-finished structures, while still suffering some angst trying to guess where they will eventually be placed. On the down side, it's possible to suffer crippling bad luck in the card draw, and that can make or break a win.

I enjoyed this with each playing, but not everyone at the table felt the same way. I guess that's the nature of area majority games where you can get pipped in a region and it affects your score dramatically. The fixed placement nature of this area majority game makes it less forgiving than others I can think of. However, that's one of the attractions for me over a game like El Grande where influence is fleeting. Good, solid game. Terrible scoring track.

Capitol -- Played once; four-player. Very strong balance of mechanics requiring balanced play in several facets throughout the game. Elegant but meaty. 

Implementation flaw: The scoring columns, while thematic, are impractical. It is just too easy to accidentally knock a scoring column out of place.  Luckily, score can be kept in any number of other ways, so gameplay is unaffected.

There's a good system lurking in this game. Players have a hand and subsequent choice of drawing cards to either: construct buildings, place a roof on buildings, place buldings in 3 areas. However, the cards also serve as money for an auction at the end of each round. The buildings score players points for majorities and second place. The auctions provide bonus buildings.

The area control aspect is rather ordinary (a combination of mahattan and Moon's clocktowers) and going for seconds especially in areas with fountains is a good idea. The hand management of meagre resources is brilliant.

This game seemed quite solid. Ite asks you some interesting questions with some interesting answers. Tests your valuation of the board, and what you expect the other players to do, and the interaction and competition is pretty fun.

Every single point you score over your opponents is a small victory that was probably well earned, so the race feels pretty tight. Card draws can play a huge role as the game goes towards its conclusion.

This is the cyborg of the boardgame world.  It has all working parts to move around and is effective in a sense that all of the mechanics work correctly, but it ain't got no soul, baby.  Playing this is like having a shoptalk conversation with a CPA.  

Posibly the least engaging game that I've ever played.  The only reason I even give this a 2 is because it actually works.  

While the board is quite beautiful, the art on the cards looks cheap and muddled, and in some way realy works against the game.  The wood is over laquered so this quickly turns into a dexterity game as buildings are on the verge of collapse. Let's not even talk about the score track.

Don't believe the hype.  Get Clocktowers instead, it is quicker, it is more elegant, and it actually has a beating heart.

Area-control with rank-based scoring based on total building height - similar to Mexica but different enough to be a fun game. Good dual use of cards (take actions, or bid for items), not enough time/resources to do what you want. Some memory element, but no one I play with can remember enough for it to matter. The theme sort of makes sense ... if the Romans built their buildings outside the city, then hauled them in? Have to think about how to make that them fit better!

RATING: 7
One of the games on my "most want to try" list and it did not disappoint.  There are so many variables to consider, such as which cards to draw, where to place your blocks, how high to build your blocks, which cards to save for the auctions, and many more.  After one play, I think it's important to win the auction that entitles you to extra cards after the first round, as you can ride that advantage throughout the game.  Also, you can score quick points by grabbing empty spaces with just one building in the middle and later rounds.  In addition, if there is more than one fountain, try to at least score second for some additional easy points.  Another game that I want to try again.

RATING: 6.5
[Schmidt Spiele 01 edition] {City building, Greek; blind-bidding, hand management, drafting, area-majority; optimal 4p} I like development games because I feel I am producing or achieving something during the game. Capitol is about building houses, a subtype of development game. Therefore, I got it from a sale of online store. Capitol is not a unique area-majority game but it has a good combination of different mechanics: bidding, hand management and drafting.

Players can find the Alan Moon's typical mechanic - card drafting in Capitol but it stands out from other Alan's games with an addition mechanic - bidding with cards. This turns Capitol into a hand management game - if you do much in the construction phase, you will lose your power in the auction phase but if you reserve too many cards for the auction phase, you will hurt yourself in the construction phase.

Capital is a good family strategy game. It's thematic and players can easily visualize moves and settings on the board. It is moderate deep - players have to plan ahead with the tight resources, to decide between building or saving cads. It also has good player interaction from competition of spaces and bonus cards. Besides, players have to carefully decide which district to occupy because the EV of district different due to the asymmetric settings. 

The bits are quite pretty but I prefer miniatures of fountain and amphitheatre. The house roofs are nicely made and the building blocks are nicely produced. The design of scoring track is innovative but it's not very practical.

[Manhattan] It is easy to compare this game with Manhattan. Capitol is a nice variant or sequel of Manhattan. However, I still think that Manhattan is more elegantly designed.

RATING: 8
Played 2+ times. I'm not a big fan of "area majority" games but it is well implemented in Capitol.  Your options start out pretty open and increase in the middle of the game and decrease as the game comes to a close.  I like that as the game comes to a close you can predict more where the players are going to play and plan your last turn partially in advance.

In Capitol there are four rounds that consist of player actions and 3 auctions and then scoring.  Who ever has the most points at the end wins.

In the player actions rounds in turn order you either play a card or pass. Once you pass you can't get back in.  There are three types of cards you can play.  The first allows you to take two blocks from the supply and either add them to one or more unfinished buildings or start a new unfinished building.  The second allows you to complete an unfinished building by adding a peaked or round roof. And the third allows you to play a completed building into one of the 9 regions of the board.  

There are a number of restrictions on where you can play your buildings.  a) The regions are divided into three colors and the card you play depicts the color you can play into.  b) you can't play into a region if there isn't any space left. c) you can only play buildings = to the current highest block height building in the region or exactly one higher.  and d) all the buildings in the region must have the same type of roof and each color must have at least one section of peaked and one section of round roofs.

Once everyone has passed you auction off 2 fountains which increase the value of the region you put it in and take up one space for a building and then one amphitheater or one temple.

Then you score each region.  Who ever has the most building blocks in each of the 9 regions gets 2 points and who ever has the second most gets 1 point.  ties are broken by highest building.  each fountain adds one point to first and second place and temples double the points for a region.

Then everyone draws six cards from the draw piles.  The piles are split into the three types of cards and the card available in each pile is face up.  There for everyone will know most of the cards you have.  (if you are first or second in a region with an amphitheater you get to draw 2 or 1 extra cards).
-----

Because you know if your opponents picked up any red area cards and you can see what types of roofs they have left and how many spaces are left in each region you are just dancing around the timing of when to commit to a certain size and roof of building and where to put them.

This is a nice, clean area-control game.  I suppose you can get a little hosed by the card draw, but by and large you are in control of your own fate.  The off-board building of towers is a great mechanism.  There is an 'outwait' element to the game whereby you have an advantage if you have more cards so the opponents have to pull the trigger on building first.  There is a memory element as well.  If you know exactly where (color-wise) each opponent can play their towers, you will be at an advantage.  Good game.

The tension in Capitol is the conflicting desire to plop down completed towers to score points each round versus the need to outwait other players so your buildings aren't trumped by their larger buildings, all while wanting to hold back some cards for the end-of-round auctions. This is still a clean, crisp, professional design that holds up well a decade after being published. I think this will still be a hit with many players, but my tastes have changed a bit and, while a simple, elegant and challenging game, Capitol is nevertheless a bit too dry and abstract for what I now want on the game table. I'll still play this, but no longer feel the need to own it. Placed on the trade pile in 2011.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a really good game, but there definitely is a luck of the draw component to the game. If, on your turn, only low-valued cards are available for you to select, then you will probably not do as well as everybody else in the next round. Still, there are some decent options and potential strategic play opportunity, so this is a good way to spend 1.5 hours (hopefully, faster after more plays). Too bad it is not more widely available and in English. The way score is tracked though is completely ridiculous though.

Capitol has some of the same area-control feel as El Grande or China, but its deck of cards makes things feel a lot more wily.  That's good because the enormous buildings that get built carry a great sense of accomplishment.  Capitol is less strategic but very impressive.

This game is a weird combination of an area control game and chicken, and the way that you build your buildings before placing them to the board adds an element of out-guessing your opponents.  Not bad.

Like an emperor, that's the way to play this game. Watch for the enemy, who will try to beat you in every region. The charme of this game lays in the competition and solide choices. This game deserves my appreciation.

Neat building game. We were playing Capitol regularly for a while then we got mired in a 2 hour crazy monstrosity of a game. We haven't broken it out since. That's not a knock on the game, but rather on one of our players whom suffers greatly from analysis paralysis.

Elegant and deceptive brain burner. Keeping a balance between using cards to bid and to use is hard. So tempting to use them all. Production quality is excellent. May up rate as a 9 when had more plays.

Played several times (with 3 and 4 players). I am rather fond of this game but cannot really explain why. I like that cards can be used in two different ways (or even three, if you consider doing nothing as a way to use a card), and also the restrictions about authorized buildings. Overall, an enjoyable game - too bad the scoring columns are so little convenient.

(Trade Interest: low/medium) even fun with two.  much more fun with four.  good strategy, and a rather innovative way of picking cards.

This one has some compelling mechanics.  I particularly find that the challenge of effictively budgeting your roofs to last you all game long is an tricky point.  I pulled off a *very* unexpected win by only one point when I had spent the entire game not winning any of the amphitheatre or temple auctions.  Oh, and yeah... the comments about the "scoring columns" - very true.  Nobody was thinking when that design got approved.

Usually games give an advantage to the first player, this is not the case in Capitol.  In fact, you want to delay putting roofs on your buildings as well as placing them on the board as late as possible so you can be sure you're not wasting the resources.  I fully acknowledge that there are a lot of tough decisions one is faced with here, but that doesn't necessarily make it an interesting experience, especially if you play with people who are ignorant and oblivious of the person they should be preventing from scoring each round.

I've only played this one a few time, but it is an excellent game.  The scoring tracks leave something to be desired, but the game itself is quite fun to play.  I don't think this is a must own, so play it before you try to get a copy.

Although there are some interesting mechanisms here, I feel this game must be played at top speed, in about half an hour, for it to be a [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] for me.

The differences between this and its remake, [thing=54643][/thing] are mostly cosmetic and ergonomic, for those who are choosing between them:
:colonist: Skyline 3000 adds one-use billboards that cost a point, reserve a spot for you, but then earn the winners in that chunk of the board an extra point.
:colonist: Skyline 3000 adds a score track around the outside to replace the innovative, fascinating, but [b]horrible[/b] score columns in this.  It's [b]far[/b] too easy to botch everyone's score in one bump or swipe — one stray sleeve, and the game is over.
:colonist: Skyline 3000's wooden components are bigger, and thus less likely to topple in play.  Oh, and the building layers are gray, instead of tannish.
:colonist: Skyline 3000's other components are bold, and brightly illustrated.  The board is very high-contrast.

I'd take [thing=54643][/thing], were I to have one of them at all.  If you don't like the billboards that were added, you can play without them — treat them like a variant.

Building something is always fun. Unless it escalates into a territorial war. This game is about avoiding commitment as long as possible. And also about card counting if that kind of thing gives you the kicks.

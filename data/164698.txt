RATING: 7
Played at the SPIEL 2014 in Essen.

I've seen the inflated prices of the original game and thus was curious what the game is about, but after the rules explanation I wondered if that could really have been... all? Even while playing, it seemed that the game was pretty much decided by the first couple of turns. But hey, I just didn't grasp the concept of those flea markets enough and found out while playing that every decision you make the entire game is important, not just the first ones. Very nicely done, bravo to Friedemann, nice game!

RATING: 7
A very odd, abstract game with the trademark 2F Spiele gaudy artwork. There is certainly depth here, but the game is so unusual that the strategies are not apparent at first. Once again, Friedemann Friese has produced something truly different to the mainstream titles. This is not a GREAT game, but Friese is to be applauded for his constant experimentation with mechanisms and modes of play.

RATING: 5
2 plays / 4 players

LIKE: A quick, tactical game with some screwage. The fast auctions are interesting, because there is no way to get more money after winning a bid.
DISLIKE: Some screwage, very cutthroat. Setup is a bit involved, but not too bad. There is a broken strategy that all players need to be aware of to prevent one player from running away with the game.

OVERALL: I don't think I enjoy this game. It doesn't have the rewards I like to feel in the game, perhaps it has too few decisions. I will acknowledge, that the game is a bit unique so it needs a play or two before players can sink their teeth in.

Much improved version of the original design.  Agonizing choices all around.  My only complaint is that the auction mechanic seems a little tacked-on.  Great components and art.

RATING: N/A
Played the original (plenary version) a long time ago and had fond memories of it, so when I saw it had been reprinted with better quality components, it was an easy decision to get a copy.  I expect I won't like the new simplified rule set as much as the original, but if it makes the game more approachable and gets it to the table more often, then its a good thing.

Played once so far, and group enjoyed it.  Overall feel of the game still seems to be there, but I think I still prefer the original board and rules.

Slightly disappointed that nuclear power is no longer one of the resources (the combo of nuclear power and fish was a nice humorous touch).

RATING: 7
I was taught the rules verbally and was told that I was playing by the first edition rules... It takes a play or two to initially understand what is going on, but once you are in full gear the gameplay shines. This is not everyone's cup of tea and if taken seriously, a gamer's game.

Thinky, opaque for neophytes and brain burning. A great game for spatially inclined gamers. I just wish that they would have taken the graphics a little more seriously. What's with Sponge Bob? 

Edit: Random tile draws may be a factor in determining the winner.

RATING: 8
It's much more accessible than some people would lead you to believe, especially with the new game.  Pretty colors, easy to understand rules and a fairly short play time (45ish minutes) makes this easy to teach kids.  However, it's an ugly cut-throat auction route building game.  

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Much more fun than the original - which I sort-of kind-of liked but was very, very, very (very) niche. Make sure to keep cash hidden all game (if you're a no-hidden-trackable-information type it won't break the game to play that way, but it's more interesting if you have to use your memory). Nice tactical/bidding game; cash and smart risk management are the key skills, much like in the original, just without the original's borderline-unplayable road development system. Anyway, this is a fun, clean-playing Friese game that fans of his should like, and should find a far larger audience than the original (although original rules are included as well). Also: quite attractive, one of his more attractive games (all prior instances were kind of ugly).

It was really interesting to see how our group's play evolved from game 1 to game 2. First game was not super-intense as we all sort of felt out the contours of system, but play 2 was really cutthroat, with lots of players getting big route numbers and quite a few tense auctions. So if your initial reaction was a bit "eh", make sure to give it one more play anyway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fairly simple, but tense, game of trying to place your market stalls as close as possible to the wares your stalls sell. Players will be vying to block each others' easy paths, while locking down easy paths of their own through clever tile placements.

I reaaaaallly disliked the original Fresh Fish due to it being so hard to wrap my brain around the rules for filling in roads, which is a crucial part of the game. However, this simplifies that rule a great deal, but in an interesting way that still keeps pressure on the players and makes for interesting game developments. If you liked the original, they still provide rules to play that way, but I greatly prefer the new rules.

Overall, a fairly simple game, but with a very cut-throat nature, and a good mix of skill vs. luck.

Remains unplayed to date. I bought it for the first edition rules which as I thought indeed share quite some similarity with the excellent Alien City, but [i]man[/i] are they worded confusingly. I'm not one to complain often of rules, knowing how hard it is to get them right in the first place... but I could not decypher them.

[b]Update[/b] The first games were played according to the rules of the revised edition. While simple, there were quite a few nasty surprises in store, with game-changing moves being made way more carelessly than their effect suggests. My opponents weren't best pleased about it all, proclaiming it dreary and disfunctional, but strangely enough also expressed interest in playing under the original rules. I guess that counts as a success of sorts.

For the new edition of Fresh Fish many of the sharp edges have been filed off. On one hand that should certainly increase its audience; the old one was kind of niche. On the other hand the changes also put the game into a more rigid corset than before which unfortunately eliminates some of its appeal to me. It's true that the old way of building roads had some issues that were mostly related to simply parsing the board state correctly but it's also true that those same rules allowed for less formalized and more creative approaches.

Fortunately, the old rules are still included in the new edition so all's well.

I think my reflex attraction to rogue strategies makes blind-auction games a bad bet for me-- certainly blind auctions like this one, where you can just lose auction after auction and get shut out of things. I'm fine with games where a scarcity of chances to act is the constraint you work under, but not where that scarcity is the punishment for poor play.

RATING: 7
Area control via paths. A simple two step mechanic of reserve space or  place tile on reserved space. Building your path while trying to block off opponents is rewarding. You want your market to be the closest to the delivery truck, but in trying to place markets, it is likely a flea market will appear and block your or your opponents path. The game is quick with hidden math, and while there is tile drawing, you feel completely in control of the game. Didn't click until the second play, but wanted to immediately play again. Plays well with two to boot!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fine game that comes with only a few rules. That however doesn't make the game less interesting or clever. It actually reminds me of older Knizia classics, few rules, but a big game.

All you do is reserving a spot or auctioning of a tile (that comes from a face down stack), but due to how the game flows, you have plenty options where and when to place things, aswell as how much you can afford to offer.

Even though it won't get a place on my holy shelf, this is a very clever design and should be a very nice family game (because it's easy), aswell as a light to medium gamer's game (because it's thinky).

Neutral - on occasion

Only played classic rules with 5p so far. I can foresee that, 2p will be chess like, and more random & take-that feature with more players. The game is well developed and the special route connection mechanism is totally fresh(for a game since 1997!). 

As many suggested, the classic rules are actually simple, but unclear at first play, which is a little bit annoying. But the novelty of mechanism should justify the ambiguity for the 1st game, and keeps the following few game promising. 

I suspect the game can't hold tons of plays, but I am sure it is worth first few tries.

Fresh Fish 是綠毛Friedemann Friese在2014年推出的新遊戲，然而同年推出的 Power Grid Deluxe (電廠豪華版) 卻整個蓋住了這款遊戲的焦點，使得Fresh Fish 沒有受到太多關注，"新鮮魚"淪為"漏網之魚"實在是太可惜了。
Fresh Fish 是個競標跟規劃位置的遊戲，玩家必須設置自己攤位的最佳位置，來獲得新鮮的食材，遊戲中每個玩家有四種攤位，必需找尋最短的運貨路徑設置對應的攤位，玩家的選擇很簡單，選擇占地或是翻開板塊，板塊分為攤位跟土堆，當然翻出攤位是必須競標獲得，遊戲中玩家的金錢是固定的，不會增加，因此必須用有限的金額來競標到想要的攤位，遊戲一直進行到每個玩家都設立了所有的攤位，將四條運貨路線加總扣除剩餘的金錢，數字越小代表路線規劃的越近，也代表能獲得更新鮮的貨品，也就是贏家。
Fresh Fish 是一款重新設計1997年的版本，新的版本包含了很多的木質token以及簡單可愛的小配件(運輸車 攤位等)，遊戲規則簡單，但玩起來格外有意思，有卡位的成分存在，也有合作開發的意味，遊戲的市場是隨機設置，因此每次遊戲都有不同的策略及體驗，我覺得耐玩性還不錯，既然是綠毛的遊戲，當然要嘗試看看。
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The new rules make Fresh Fish much more approachable. Gameplay feels different, more streamlined and direct. Gone are the subtle, surprisingly mean moves. Now, players mostly see it coming when they get hosed.  Gone also are the constantly confusing rules for laying roads.

It's too long ago since I played the original but my gut feeling is that the original rules were more interesting although having a need to polish some of the rough edges. Fortunately, the new game is interesting in its own right and the box contains the old rules as well. Better with more players, my play with three was a bit too tame.

This is a game that I would have expected to like: Action takes place on a central board, there's strong player interaction, and it plays in under an hour. It has tile laying and bidding. It almost sounds like Santiago, one of my favorite games!

I think it was the vacant lot (flea market?) tiles that soured the game for me: they come up randomly, and when they do, whoever pulled them out is trying to screw people as much as possible. So you could have N-1 turns where people are screwing you without you being able to react in any way.

In any case, it was a vicious experience that felt half random. Not enjoyable.

Blind bidding, topped off with cutthroat battles for real estate.  This game plays fast, but does not play light.

RATING: 8
Fresh Fish, with its cute and absurd theme is in fact a very opaque war of positioning. Players try to wrest control over the road network that slowly emerges through a simple logical function - there can only be one road network and the road network has to be able to connect to all squares. The game also comes with the new option of playing with pre-defined areas, but I’ve not played with the revised rules as I find the simple elegance of the old game to be just what I want. 

This is a cut-throat game of blocking, sabotage and trick evaluations. You need to look ahead, plan contingencies and twist your brain trying to visualise the myriad of configurations the board can take. The classic rule is simply in form, but in practice it is a struggle to visualise how the network will take shape even after a few plays. But once you learn to visualise it the game grows tremendously as players now fight for control and create lose lose situations for the other players. You learn how to deviously sabotage a player's position, and so the positional play and auction valuations become exquisite lest the same will happen to you. The low playtime ensures that players can quickly internalise the workings of the game and be competitive. A quirky game, full of clever plays, risk and tension in a neat package.

Friese's gift for making deep games out of simple, deterministic rule-sets becomes apparent yet again in Fresh Fish. It's almost entirely abstract, of course, and the visualisations and planning won't appeal to everyone, but otherwise the difficulty level seems to be pitched dead on: just tantlisingly out of reach of most players.

The new edition randomises the boards for extra repeatability; however, I fear it won't have all the lifespan that the design has intended.

Fresh Fish is a really super cut-throat game, but I didn't hate it. Oddly, it felt a little like TransAmerica, in which I'm constantly trying to make moves to reduce the damage. Blind bidding makes this game difficult, but I think it would be just as cut-throat with any other type of bidding. While the game might seem to be about contingency planning, it's really about placing such that other players can't screw with you.

Very simple rules, yet some tough decisions sometimes. You don't necessarily want to be really close to the truck as you may get cut off. But you get too far and it becomes difficult to get there.

I'd love to play this with more players as I think 2 worked fine mechanically, but it loses some tension that a 4 player game would have.

Rating may rise another point with repeat plays.

September 2016: Downgrade from 6 to 3. After a second play, our perceptions of this game worsened. I really still like the extortion mechanism, but the other mechanisms attached to it: auctioning tiles, and the random tile draw between food shack (good) to flea market (sucky) made the game drag and made it very, very difficult to plan for huge, long-term fuck-you moves.

January 2016: Disappointing, but that's only after one play, and I did a poor explanation of the rules, which is quite easy in this game. We played with the classic rules.

I had high expectations for this game because I found the main mechanism (which reminded me of Quoridor) intriguing.

Loses points for poor art design. The tiles and the board are all the same colour, which makes it very difficult to see empty spaces that should be built over with paths.

For me, it seemed that it wasn't as strategically deep as I was expected (although I could be easily proved wrong about this).

Rating for the "new" rules. I have yet to play the classic rules, which appear far more appealing.

The Fresh Fish reprint reminds me a bit of Martin Wallace's streamlining of Brass into Age of Industry. On paper, it all works: the modular board provides more variety, play it significantly streamlined, expropriation is much easier to grasp. But along the way it loses most of what makes the original special.

Instead of the elegant global expropriation rule, there's a system of grouped spaces on the board; when 1 or 2 in the section are turned into stalls then the remainder are expropriated. This is both easier to track and easier to influence at a local level, and that's the problem. It's not that opacity in itself is a virtue, it's that the whole-board scope placements in the original, and the difficulty in targeting the outcome of any given placement until very late in the game, added a kind of layer of subtle incentive management that now seems absent. Instead of the board slowly coming into focus, it emerges in chunks.

It all does work -- like Age of Industry, it's not a [i]bad[/i] game. It just seems bad by comparison. I have no real interest in playing the new rules again, but the "classic variant" seems close enough to the original to be worth the time.

RATING: 8
Quick-playing and attractive. The new rules seem to make the game a lot more accessible, eliminating the risk of illegal moves.

I really like the rule that if you don't win an auction that you started, it's still your turn.

In short you try to build four markets such that they have the shortest path lengths to the corresponding delivery trucks. You reserve spaces on the board in advance of trying to build anything. This is because when you do decide to build something, you draw a tile, and you may have to place a worthless (but road-blocking) "flea market" on a reserved space, rather than a market. If you draw a market, there's an auction. Everyone has $15 to spend over the entire game and whatever isn't spent gets deducted from their total path length. (This correspondence of one coin to one step of distance helps make the auctions less opaque.)

The auction seems to mitigate the sense of luck from the tile draw. I don't have the sense that the game is particularly tactical or chaotic either: Things built on the board never move; you spend the game filling in areas that haven't been populated yet. It's all about tracing paths back to those stationary delivery trucks.

I haven't yet decided whether I like it or [i]really[/i] like it. But the type of design is right up my alley.

...Tried the classic rules. They're interesting also. Between that and just the fact that this is a game I always want to play (despite that it rarely happens), I'm upping the rating to 8.

Beautiful in its simplicity, it looks like a family game. It is so much more than that. Highly interactive and cutthroat, it's all about playing the other players. Great game.

I had never played the original before, and had lots of fun playing this in Essen this year. But what's with the gigantic box?? Shelf space is a precious resource for a games!!

I've only played the revised rules and it's been quite fascinating. Trying to use the revised rules to then get everyone up to speed and into the original rules! Can't wait to actually play with the original rules. :)

Recent reprint is a complete car crash.

The new rules mean it's possible to cut off entire sections of the board. Completely meh.

Don't bother with the new rules- play by the original rules. Amazing game that now has the production value it deserves. You shouldn't play with 5 until everyone is experienced.

Fresh Fish is an interesting spatial game.  You end up kind of speculating on the value of a spot when you claim it but with the right claims and tile flips you can have a fair amount of control over making this valuable... or tanking someone else's value!  I don't know yet if this will climb into the Taluva/Samuari/Medina/Metropolys rotation... but it certainly seems possible.

I have not yet played the classic variant in the rules... but I'm looking forward to it!

Quite a quick game; fun, if slightly evil ;-)

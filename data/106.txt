I prefer Wyatt Earp (with any number of players, including 2), but Jack the Reaper is also a very good card game. The possibility to bet for predicting the identity of the killer and the possibility of Jack to escape is what makes the game different and more interesting.

I thought I had rated this game a long time ago but apparently forgot. Flat-out brilliant game and a long-time favorite. Tight, atmospheric theming and powerful dramatic arc keep it from feeling like just a rummy variant. Tense, engaging, super fun. Love the artwork, too. Hats off to such brilliant designing from Mike Fitzgerald.

RATING: 8
Nice rummy varient. Light but still lots of choices. I like the fact that there are 2 ways to end a hand, going out or playing the Ripper Escapes card. That keeps the tension level up a bit. I'm on the fence as to which I like better JtR or Wyatt Earp. Both are very similar but have interesting differences. The Ripper Escapes card adds a very nice element to JtR as does the voting mechanic. But the accumulating money on the outlaws in Wyatt Earp is neat as well. At least in this one you get a deck of standard size cards of fairly good quality unlike the smaller cards in Wyatt Earp. I also think that JtR may play better with only two players.

RATING: 8.5
Wow, four plays and not one single win. This seems to be a favorite of my GF; not only because she beats me badly every time we play, I hope. This reminds her of the card game "500", which she apparently is quite good at.

The core game is actually pretty easy to grasp, but there is a surprising amount of tactical choices here. Ripper Escapes only comes in to play ever so often, but when it does it makes the game a nail biting race. Even without it this would be a solid rummy game. The theme is excellent, and it actually gives you a feeling (although abstract) of solving the Ripper case. I even think the rules might be easier to understand if you get into the theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An excellent game that relies on rummy but it makes the whole game so much better and it gives it a theme that blends very well. Jekyll & Hyde is also good but this is better with more options and more fun to play! Another game to check in this genre is Wyatt Earp. Excellent rummy based games both of them! Congratulations Mr. Fitzgerald!

The game is quite strategic, but the rules!  My my, they are overly completed and repetitive.  Once the rules are comprehended (its best to play 2 turns than to read the rules), the game will play quickly and well.  There are several strategic actions available and each hand is unique.  This is a game that the more you play, the more strategies emerge.  A very good filler game and as the box says "extremely good with 2 players".  [GTI Code: TPCL]

RATING: 7.4
Fun spin on the Rummy mechanic, you are playing melds of Evidence, Suspects, Alibis, and other cards to score points and perhaps block out particular Suspects for being Jack the Ripper in that round. Interesting card interactions, especially if you're using one of the powerful cards towards a 'Ripper Escapes' shutout. One gripe I have is that the presentation of the rules seems overly complex; I feel like they could have been streamlined a little, and the order changed around; once I got it going it was fairly easy to pick up.

RATING: 10
The original rules are dreadful but after making a playing aid and using some of the aids from the game's Files, it turns out to be an excellent experience. For those players who tried this game and gave up because of the unfriendly rules, you are missing a very good game. Give it another try using some player aids.

Jack the Ripper is much more fun than our two other Mystery Rummy games Jekyll&Hyde and Bonnie&Clyde. With 6 gavel (action) cards, you have many more options and tough decisions to make. While building melds you must be careful what you discard, since your opponent can possibly take it and use it against you later in the game. Every hand seems different than the others and we are really enjoying the challenge of a rummy game with some depth. 

So far, Jack the Ripper is moving up fast on our list of favorites, and I expect it will only get better once we play more and learn some of the game's nuances. It is very enjoyable as a 2-P game.

A major flaw: US Games kept the same crummy rules they provided with the 2003 edition for the 2009 reissue. That's indefensible.

Note: BE SURE to download the File by Liumas; it will be very helpful when learning this game. Also take a look at my Player Aid "Jack the Ripper Cards" in JtR FILES. Once you know the cards you'll be playing the game in no time.

Picked this game up for a song at my local thrift store.  Didn't know the gem I had until I checked on BGG and then played it.  I truly like all aspects of this rummy variant.  The vote can be enticing, especially if you happen to have an appropriate alibi, and the Ripper Escapes card keeps you on your toes.  I've only played with my wife so far, but we both enjoy it.  It frustrates her at times, but I think with more plays it will grow on her.  I also found the Murders of the Rue Morgue at the same store, different expedition.  Haven't played that version, but am intrigued with comparing the two.  [Thrift $.99]

RATING: 7.9
I like two player card games (at this notionally plays with 3-4 as well) and this one manages to take Rummy and twist it into something moderately thematic that will work great as a compromise game between fans of traditional card games and fans of contemporary designer card games.  Rules are not that well explained in rulebook but BGG comes to the rescue.  Not a complex game but there is a small amount of fiddle in the rules - lots of fun and makes for a more sedate and strategic feel than the similar but more luck swingy and combo full Plato 3000.  In these styles of games choosing the right discard is key and that is where many of the interesting decisions lie but this is well enough layered that there is a lot more to it
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I've found that I *really* enjoy playing this game.  I'm not exactly sure why yet, but it's always a hoot, even if I get my ass handed to me.  Being nice and light, it makes for a wonderful choice to end a night's gaming on.  So far, I've only played it with two players, and I'm curious to see how well it scales up.

*NOTE* Luck seems to have a pretty large impact on one's success at this game.  After playing this game numerous times, it's frustrating to have a bad deal completely rook your opponent.

*OTHER NOTE*  This one really suffers with four people.  This one seems ideal for only two players.  Have yet to try it with three.  Might be *okay*...

A fun game once you get the rules down, and start to see the strategies.  The first few times you play it makes it seem like the game is all luck.  The rulebook needs work - there are important parts scattered throughout (for example, it is not explained how much it costs to be holding &quot;Ripper Escapes&quot; in the scoring section - you need to look in the glossary).

Bought this and the #4 Al Capone because we were playing Wyatt Earp a lot and thought a different rummy variant would be a nice change. We have been pleased - this is an excellent game.

One note: the cards are very thick, which is apparently a known issue with most of the MR series. The cards are extremely difficult (dare I say nearly impossible?) to shuffle. We play it enough that I would consider buying a new copy if the card stock issue is ever fixed in a future reprint. (nb: It was not changed for the 2009 reprint. Blargh.)

Of our 4 "rummy" games, I rate Wyatt Earp, MR: Jekyll & Hyde and this the same (although I probably like Wyatt Earp the most, then JtR, then J&H), and all of those above MR: Al Capone.

Adds a few twists and turns to the traditional game of Rummy with top notch production values (thick, glossy cards - though almost impossible to riffle shuffle). Luck of the draw plays its part, but there are enough opportunities for skillful play to keep the decisions interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a very clever, satisfying two player game which ends up being a little more than you expect it to be. At least with the new rules, it is not at all as difficult to understand as has been presented. Yes, some of the core game play is based on Rummy, but not the most interesting parts - or even the elements that are most decisive in winning the game. Each decision that would be a no-brainer in Rummy is balanced against two or three other considerations which makes the game deeper than might be apparent for a thirty minute card game. The best part is that, even if approached as such, the ghost of a theme starts to float over the game. Is your partner putting together a dramatic series of surprise attacks which allows the Ripper to escape after all? This is a portable, easy to learn (really) very quick game which packs interesting decisions and offers excellent mood. What more could you demand from a card game?

RATING: 6
I like rummy and this is a fun rummy variant.  Definitely the game you already know at its heart.  The other cards spice up the rummy aspect (suspect and alibi cards.)  Or add a sort of "shoot the moon"-esque Ripper Escapes victory condition.  The cards actually make sense thematically which is the game's greatest strength- for instance, playing a victim card makes you draw two cards increasing your chance of drawing another victim but decreasing your chance of going out (ie catching the ripper).  Pretty cool if you're not expecting too much- it's still basically rummy.

I have never played Rummy, but I really like this game, as players face tough choices each turn (which cards to play/keep/discard while trying to get rid of their hands). Oddly for a card game, the theme is exceptionally implemented. Illustrations are wonderful (woodcut-like), but the card stock is atrocious - card sleeves are a must.

1 play. Horribly confusing. Even after we grasped the rules, there didn't seem to be much substance to the game. (And, frankly, the theme didn't help.) So many people like it that I'll try it again, but this game is on a short leash.

UPDATE: After playing Wyatt Earp, we retried Jack the Ripper. Much easier to learn! And, it turns out, a very fun game. Not as good as Wyatt Earp still (since WE has more opportunities for screwing the other player over completely, plus escalating stakes).

UPDATE: 7 -> 8. This game is just fun, and quick. The more we play, the more we like it.

This game requires a bit of explaining the first time out ... not just the rules (which are not well-presented in the rulebook), but the important interactions of a few key cards (especially the Ripper Escapes) which more or less drive the game. Rummy is no great shakes to begin with, and this version didn't do a lot for me - I thought Wyatt Earp was much better, and I'm not exactly a Wyatt Earp fan. Apparently designed for 2 players.

A nice rummy variant.  If your in the mood for something light, relatively quick, and there are only two of you, this is a good choice.  Not my favorite card game, but definitely has a step up on original rummy.

I've always been a fan of regular rummy, and I enjoy this as a really interesting twist on that. 

My only complaint is that you can't shuffle these cards! Yes, it's nice that they'll last longer, but I would rather the cards were not as thick and stiff, and that I could shuffle them like regular cards.

Overall a really, really good game. This is one of those I wish I'd had during my college days when we stayed up all night playing cribbage and poker and rummy 500

RATING: 8
A tightly designed and well crafted rummy variant. At first glance, the limited number of cards in each suit, the alternate victory condition and the event cards that supplement it, and the many gavel cards may seem unwieldly and overwrought, and they make the game difficult to teach (the atrocious rulebook only exacerbates the problem).But the mix of cards is actually highly tuned to ensure constant and significant decision tension, which ramps up as the game progresses and crescendos nicely during the endgame. It only works well with two, though, as with more players suits tend to lock up and the Ripper escapes too often.

Production: The Victorian artwork is nice, but the cards suffer from terrible artistic design, with superfluous text too-prominently featured, and a clash between the colored sidebars and the black backgrounds (I thought black went with everything).  Play: Now that I’ve found Wyatt Earp, I see no reason to return to this title, with its non-intuitive theme (melding evidence causes a suspect to be the killer?) and difficult (for me) rules.  (1+0+1)

A victim appears in the streets of London.

Investigators begin gathering evidence.

Accusations are made and suspects are named.

And then you run out of cards and add up the points to see who the winner is.

Jack the Ripper is best with two players.
The difference between JtR and the others, is there is a guessing element to the game. At one point, you may make a gamble on who is Jack - if you are correct you get points.
That is nowhere else in the MR games.
Jekyll and Hyde - is strictly a two player game.
Rue Morgue - is good with partners
Al Capone - is Canasta-like
Bonnie and Clyde - is umm... not the best in the series.
Escape from Alcatraz - can be a bit more complicated and confusing.

Short Description:
----------------------
Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper is a rummy game with some little twists added. Each round, each player gets dealt a set number of cards. It's your goal to get rid of them in such a way that you score the most points when a round ends. The feature that differentiates Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper from rummy the most is the addition of two different scoring-methods: 

Method 1 - Jack the Ripper gets caught: This scoring-method is used if one player empties his hand. In order to get points, you basically try to collect as much sets of evidence-cards as possible and preferable you have a lot of evidence-cards for Jack the Ripper.

Method 2 - Jack the Ripper escapes: This scoring-method is normally triggered whenever a player manages to play a "Jack the Ripper escapes"-card. In this case only this player recieves 35 points, which is quite a lot.

You play hands until one player has reached 100 or more points.

Comments:
--------------
* The german rulebook is one of the worst rulebooks I have ever read. Don't get me wrong, all needed facts are there but they are presented in a very bad way. Important rules are hidden in the description of the cards and in the glossary at the end of the rulebook, although you really need them before that, namely during the description of the gameplay. So the first time I read the rules, I didn't even have the slighest idea what I was supposed to do in this game.

* The game is basically rummy with an added layer of strategy. While I found it quite entertaining, it is a little too light and repetitive for my liking.

Wonderful initial entry into the Mystery Rummy series, which all feature traditional rummy elements matched with a terrific theme and rules befitting the theme. This first game, based on the gruesome Jack the Ripper murders, is the most complex and best of the lot. The rules are a bit difficult to digest initially, but once you've got them down then a great game awaits (it's not nearly as complex as the rules make it sound).

I like this game, but I also feel I have not yet played it enough to truly appreciate the depth that seems to be waiting here.  

The rules, however, are a mess.  I don't think I've ever had so much trouble with a rulebook as this one.  Once you get past it, the game is not very complicated.  I think the problem is mainly that the first half of the rules should be last.  You need to read the rules all the way through before you have any idea what's going on.

If it weren't for the rules issue, I would say this this is a great game to give as a gift.  The cards are very high quality and the box is amazing.

UPDATE May 2015:  I finally played this game again after many years.  This one one of the first games I bought when I was getting into the modern era of boardgames, and I've been finding it very interesting how my tastes have changes (matured?) over the years.  

Where I originally thought I had an inability to grasp the strategy of the game, during my latest plays I instead felt like there are many uncontrollable elements, and that your performance is largely based on luck. So my tastes are either more refined now, or I've just become arrogant :)  I also found the flow kinda clunky.  Sometimes you draw a bunch of melds and end the hand quickly, and other times both players stall for a while until someone finally draws the right card.  

I think my latest plays really made me appreciate the durability of "Lost Cities", a game that also has you collecting sets but avoids the uneven performance of JtR.

Solid rummy variant which is really quite a bit further from rummy than I expected.

Solid theming really helps this shine.

I don't understand why Rummy is such a popular game. It seems the winner is randomly determined by the luck of the draw. And it is SO frustrating to watch the player to your left discard a card you need only to watch it get buried forever. Then they take Rummy and create spinoff games of it with theme? The theme of this one makes the game even worse. A serial killer who murders prostitutes is hardly something to celebrate with a card game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It's rummy with many additional rules and rule exceptions, written in a terrible rulebook. Unfortunately the exceptions increase complexity without increasing tension enough to warrant them. I don't think the game was designed with tension as its primary goal, though, so I recognize that people who want a more relaxing game may still enjoy this. Sold.

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time.

The rulebook is horrible.  Now that that's out of the way, I can say that it's a really fun game.  It's also highly thematic with the exception of alibis.  I find the decisions of what to discard to be interesting and you always have to be wary of when the Ripper escapes.  Ideally I would have liked for this game to come with dice and a reference card that state what number on the dice corresponds to a Suspect so you don't need to use pen & paper for voting.  Also percentile dice for keeping score would have been wonderful as well.  This is something easily remedied.

This is the most popular in the "Mystery Rummy" series, and is best with 2 players.  Very fun and interesting rummy variant, gives so many more options than basic Rummy that it won't even feel like Rummy! Another popular rummy variant with theme is Wyatt Earp (best with 3-4 players).  It takes a few plays to master the rules and strategic choices the game offers, but it is well worthwhile!

This is a game my wife loves, despite how frustrated she gets when I'm able to pull off the "Ripper Escapes" card.  Great two player game, lots of tension and solid decision making.  Have a feeling this is one that will get a lot of play in the years to come.

A rather dark theme means I won't play it much, but it's worth saying that this is a very unique application of the theming to the mechanics. Much better than Jekyll & Hyde in that respect. Though similar to rummy, this particular game is the most different from rummy of all the games in the Mystery Rummy series.

At the end of the day this is still just Rummy (once you've worked your way through the fairly horrible rulebook, anyway), but it's Rummy with a couple of twists and special cards and an interesting if somewhat odd attempt at applying a theme.

So, how much of a difference does it make, then? I don't like Rummy very much but Jack the Ripper spices things up enough that I can see this being played every now and then. There is a nice tension between keeping cards and going out, some means to sabotage melds played by your opponent and additional ways to end a round. Well worth a look if you do like Rummy, and maybe even if you don't.

EDIT:  Yeah, this one feels like a 7.  Weird how the theme fits the game--pretty darned clever (runs = evidence...well, you can't find Evidence if there's no Victim...and unless you have Evidence, you can't nail a Suspect...and if you can't get the Suspect, he doesn't need an Alibi...and you lose points from what's in hand because you were following bad leads...)I like this one!

Rummy with a twist and a theme. Sounds strange? It is. And hell - it is playable! Luck elements (after all it's a card game) don't determine the winner but force you to carefully plan. The mixture is just perfect.

The rules are not the simplest ones but after one play you know what's going on and there is problem in figuring out what to do.

I'd recommend it to anyone liking card games. It's one of the most unique ones.

For a game based on rummy, there's a surprising amount of strategy to be found in Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper.  It somehow manages to combine the lightness of rummy with the subtlety of more sophisticated card games.  And if that's not enough, the Jack the Ripper theme is also incorporated very thoroughly and convincingly.  My one quibble is that the game is difficult to teach to casual gamers.

Jack the Ripper is perfectly balanced for two players, and starts to break down with more.  With three or more, there's much less tactical maneuvering, and the game ends too often with the "Ripper Escapes" card.  I recommend only playing with two, but if you must play with more, consider removing that card.

I feel that there might be too many obvious plays in this one. This is what started to turn me off of Rummy in the first place. Can't help but feel that if you draw a Victim in your starting hand the obvious thing is to play it. This removes some of the tension that the game hoped to create by the "can't play evidence melds until a victim is played". Maybe I should take a Victim out of the game?    

Overall, the game borders on absolutely fantastic. I definitely think it is great and enjoy the combination of wanting to build your hand to score big and keep your hand small to go out quickly. The decision of whether or not to lay down a meld of evidence can be brutal.

The 'gavel' cards spice up the basic Rummy game for extra scoring opportunities and more tense hand management decisions.  Simple(ish) and fun to play, the game can even be genuinely tense when holding the 'Ripper Escapes' card and willing Lady Luck to hand you that final Victim card for a risky scoring opportunity. The theming fits the mechanics well, and the dour woodcut-style artwork adds to the atmosphere.

This game is a popular choice with my friends and my Dad, so clearly a game non-gamers can enjoy too.  I'm not quite as enamoured, hence the 6.5. Played 2-player only so far.

*update*
I haven't wanted to play this in yonks and it has shunted down the ratings appropriately.

I like this game.  Much better than playing Gin Rummy.  The rules can be a little difficult to understand the first time through and I played several games the wrong way before we finally figured it out.  It's easy to miss the fact that there can only be one Alibi card out.  Overall  this game is enjoyabe but really shines once all players understand the Ripper Escpaes sub game.  Currently one of my favorite two player games 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
As a two player. I'd rate it a 7 as a four player game simply because the Ripper Escapes strategy becomes so much easier that the other elements of gameplay are reduced in consequence.

The gavel cards give you a fantastic range of play options. Fashioning the round's cards into an effective strategy is very satisfying. And the ripper vote is a superb element added to the mix, adding a fine layer of meta-game onto each hand.

I can't believe this game is out of print.

RATING: 8
Great game, strong theme.  The first in a series of rummy variant card games released by Mike Fitzgerald. Each set tweaks basic rummy rules in some way.  Players form colored melds of the Ripper&#039;s victims, crime scenes, and possible suspects.  Other cards &quot;break the rules&quot; (letting you draw more cards, go into the discard pile, steal cards, etc.) The identity of the Ripper is determined at the end of each hand based on the highest scoring suspect meld.  Historically accurate, well-designed graphically and mechanically, and intuitive even for rummy novices.  The whole series is great, but this (and Al Capone) are my personal favorites.  This one also plays beautifully with two players.

RATING: 6
[Initial Impression: 7] Easy to learn and fast to play, this game is a fun way to pass some time.  I've only ever played it with 2-players, although it would obviously be harder to make melds and would therefore take longer with more players.  The strategy seems fairly straight-forward, with the real decisions being when to call a vote (try not to make it too obvious who you'll predict as the Ripper), whether to try the Ripper Escapes route, and trying to intuit when your opponent is holding the Ripper Escapes card or is about to play out all their cards.  One thing I dislike is the possibility (which seems to happen more often than it should) of one player getting dealt a hand that can be played out very rapidly.  Playing multiple rounds is supposed to even out this kind of luck, but it's still bothersome when one player scores a large number of points after just 3-4 turns and the other is left holding a fistful of cards that will bring negative points.  I've seen some very lop-sided victories because of this, but it also means come-from-behind victories can be possible.

A friend of mine got this and at first I resisted playing because I disliked Rummy.  It's a good thing, however, that I gave it a shot because this game is totally different with all the themed mechanics.  Speaking of which, the theme is excellently intergrated and probably one of the better melds (no pun intended) between gameplay and subject matter I've seen.  The decision making and player interaction is great.  Very solid.

Update:  After an unfortunate midflight spill, I thought this game was done for.  I watched in horror as the cards swelled and warped under the sticky liquid mass of doom upon that fateful chair tray.  Strangely enough, just a few days ago, I picked up the game and opened it to lament upon its passing only to notice through some miracle of time that the cards were actually fine!  So I come to praise the durability of these little suckers.  After soaking up half a Sprite, they only ended up having minor damage without impacting playability in any significant way!

Jun08: Horrible rules, great game!  I've owned Wyatt Earp for awhile, but went back and checked this one out finally.  I'm glad I did!  A much better game in my opinion.

I like the solid rummy game mixed with a thematic detective case.  It even mixes in an alternative victory condition that makes thematic sense!  I really like the "prediction" part where you can score points for guessing who the ripper is ahead of time.  There's a lot of real meaningful decisions to be made.

Overall, just an amazing game.

After many plays (mostly two-player) Mystery Rummy has gone down a bit for me. I still really like what it does with the Rummy system and it is easily my favorite rummy game. I have  gotten to the point where play feels pretty automatic and it doesn't feel like there is much left to discover.

This game is much like Rummy, but doesnt really feel like Rummy because the theme is somewhat immersive and works to provide a fun gaming experience with a small group.

RATING: 7
Great couples game and very clever design. The rules arent the best but really not that bad especially if you know rummy and I appreciate the extra elements thrown in here to keep it interesting. Just make a little player aid with when certain cards can be played and you'll be off and running. 

Yes its mostly rummy and has a good dose of luck but the added elements really spice it up quite a bit and do add some strategy making it an entertaining little game. For example there is some push your luck with the voting timing and Jack escaping aspects and there are some other extra cards that add to the theme and gameplay as well and there is some tension as the deck gets depleted. 30 minutes tops and should play 3 okay too. My preferred way to play Rummy, can be an addicting little game. Very well playtested, with all the added elements not a single tweak needed which really surprised me. Can be hard for Jack to escape but a little planning helps and that is why it is 35 points which is big. 

I dont usually care about components too much but this is really nicely presented with the box opening like a book and like a card game should it has excellent card quality. Nicely laminated, think card stock (just a hair too thick maybe but I'd rather have it that way than the other), fullsize, if all games would include cards like this we wouldnt even need the crummy sleeves

Initial Rating: 5.5 (May 2015)

Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper is a weird game. From the rules it seemed very complex but in practice it is very easy. I think the rulebook does a poor job of explaining the game.

It seems MR:JtR has some hidden depth that eluded me in my only play, so I’m still unsure about how I feel about the game. More plays are needed to gauge if I enjoy it or not. However I was expecting a better game from the start. I really hope the other games in the series to be better but I still have hope for this one.

The art of the cards is good enough for me and I like it. Best with 2 players. I love the theme and I feel it does come through during play.
 
Bottom line, I love cards games so I want to play again MR:JtR soon to see if I can enjoy it. As I said before it is a weird game and I feel I didn’t grasp it well enough in one play. When I play it again I will come back to re comment. 

Current Rating:  5.5

RATING: 8
Quick fun game.  Generally rummy, with some extra elements (special cards) to inject some twists and a little more player interaction.  I'd give it a '7' so far based on gameplay alone, but I give this a bonus for the quality of the cards.  The cards are thick and a little difficult to shuffle, but they look and feel great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The ability to shut out the other player (like shooting the moon in Hearts) really adds to the game. There is also a good mix of card abilities; you can take cards from the deck, the discards, other players' hands, and other players' layouts. Everyone is always at risk of losing the right cards at the wrong time.

RATING: 5
Adds special cards and theme; but, for me, still doesn't escape Rummy. Adding a Suspect card to a meld potentially doubles its pt-value--unless canceled by an Alibi. But any other Alibi cancels another...  You've may offer a 10-pt wager which suit will be largest.  Alternative victory condition is playing Jack Espape card with five Victims out... which requires other special cards to enact. My problem is even with all the bells-and-whistles the game isn't better than plain old Gin or Canasta, both of which I find mediocre at best.  (For a more meaty 2p game than JtR, with some of the same feel, go with Haggis.  Or Jo Jotte)  
Surprisingly, I enjoy Wyatt Earp very much--which is surprising since it's yet another Fitzgerald rummy with very similar rules to this game.

This is a great game to take on a trip. My wife and i love the flavor text and feel like we are trying to track down jack the ripper (or help him escape). We played this on a plane!!! A very fun and strategic game, one we just can't play just once.

RATING: 9
Reprint.  This game is not nearly as difficult and convoluted as the rulebook makes it out to be, as a matter of fact, the enclosed rulebook is simply godawful.  Fear not...  simply read through the helpful player aids and many reviews provided here on BGG... and then go back to the rulebook.  Believe me it will be well worth your effort.  

MR:JtR is a remarkable game of calculated hand management and set collecting, with further layers of thematic depth.  The 'Gavel' specialty cards add a fun and tactical variant to this traditional game of Rummy, and knowing who the Ripper is, is the ultimate key to scoring... big time.  Gotta love the manipulative use of the 'Alibi' cards.  

For some reason I feel compelled to collect the 4 (sucker-meld) 'Letters' cards...  OCD perhaps?

RATING: 6
I don't generally like rummy-style games, but this one is moderately engrossing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
* Kickstarted with #5! *

Put down a victim card so that you and the other players can play sets of evidence to the table. When someone runs out of cards or the deck runs out, whoever has the most evidence is Jack that round -- unless the killer is the one with the alibi, then it's the next highest -- and those points are doubled for you. Subtract cards left in hand. Keep track of points until you reach 100. Rules aren't the best laid out, but once you play a hand you can get through the game no problem; it's quick to play, and is good for 1-2 plays until you're ready for the next game.

PLUS: easy to learn, use of history
MINUS: rulebook that explains the cards on one side and THEN you get to how to play on the back

After four plays, I'd say this is a seven or possibly an eight. Very good game, well worth the money. For some reason, playing it reminds me vaguely of both Lost Cities and Zirkus Flohcati, two other great games. I believe Mike (the author) mentioned on Geekspeak that it was originally intended only for two players, but that the publisher put '2-4 players' on it despite his protests. I can see how it is probably best with just two and likely won't play with more.

Rating will probably rise with more play, as my first play was weird.  Not knowing how to play regular rummy, the rules actually seemed confusing for me.

It seems like a very good game for two, and I'd like to try it again soon.

I don't really get this game. Its not rummy in the true sense (there are no sequential numbers, just colors), and it seems too random to have much control over. Its an okay game, but for the amount of rules to learn vs. (length of game   fun factor), its probably not worth it.

A good couples game, particularly for someone who doesn't want to spend time learning the intricacies of a deeper game and yet still wants a strategic element.

[LUp 08-Jan-2008] In October I got Gregor to teach me how to play this as I had read the rules twice and felt totally defeated.  Playing it made it click quite quickly.

Best of the Mystery Rummys. I like the logic of the rules. Ya gotta have a victim before you can start collecting evidence, you need evidence pointing to a person before that person can be a suspect, and before that person needs an alibi, can't be the Ripper if you have an alibi, etc. Loads of fun.

I'm not a huge fan of Rummy, I think it's rather boring, but I was interested in this due to its simplicity and quick play. It seems interesting and definitely has more thought necessary than regular Rummy. I'm not sure how often I'd like to play it but likely I'll keep it around as a decent yet simple option for games to go with coffee or a drink.

Update: after 6 plays I feel about the same. Not a really thought provoking game but good enough to play in the morning. While I like Cribbage better I think this has about the same level of play so it works well enough. I describe it as %50 more interesting than Rummy.

Game feels quite a nice and the theme is great. The rules are not complicated (I own 2th edition) when you realize how everything works, so the game flows smoothly. Not great, not bad - just OK rummy game for me. In two player game, Jack the Ripper escapes VERY rarely - that's something you should always keep in mind. If there are more than two players then the game is more balanced I guess?

A very cool rummy game that has great artwork and story telling to boot.

I definitely think this could be my two player card game winner.

This is an excellent game that I enjoy playing with non-gamers.  It offers the comfort factor of traditional rummy with enough added elements to make it interesting.  As a bonus, I have to say they've been surprisingly successful in integrating the theme into the gameplay.  Even the flavor text has been interesting enough to urge me to pick up a book on the old Jack the Ripper mystery.

I must say I'm disappointed in this rummy variant especially because many indicate that this is [url=http://www.faidutti.com/index.php?Module=ludotheque&id=160]THE mystery rummy game to own[/url]. The problem is that we started with [b]Mystery Rummy: Jekyll & Hyde[/b] based on [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/173394]cvlw's review[/url]. I must agree that J&H is a cleaner game with subtle strategy.

Jack the Ripper, on the other hand, is difficult to explain because of the prerequisites required. For example, evidence melds require any victim in play whereas suspect cards require an evidence meld of the same color in play. Unfortunately there are more such rules.

Next, the initial deal seems to have a large effect on the round. Our games consisted of one person starting with many cards in two colors and the other person starting with a rainbow of colors. Multi-colored hands are less forgiving than in J&H.

Finally, a positive note. I do appreciate how different JtR and J&H feel from one another. I had worried that the games would be basically the same with different themes, but this concern was unfounded.

Traded.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a great twist on a classic card game.  The gloomy theme and artwork brings a slightly gothic feel.  It's not a deduction game like [GAMEID=1294] per se, but it does give an atmosphere of a crime novel.  Surprisingly, this is one of the most thematic games that we have.  The included rules are a mess, but it's much easier to think of the gameplay in terms of a real crime scene.  Before you really get started, you have to have a Victim card played before you can start playing melds of Evidence for the crime.  You can't play a Suspect or Alibi card unless there is already Evidence pointing towards them.  The gavel cards give you some special abilities, like searching through the deck, taking one of your opponent's played cards, or forcing your opponent to discard.  You can even call a vote for who you suspect the Ripper will be, which adds a little cat and mouse feature to the game.

Not only do you have to worry about scoring melds and identifying the Ripper, there is also the Ripper Escapes card, which feels a lot like "shooting the moon" in [GAMEID=6887].  With two people, it can start being a tense duel as both players start trying to fish for more Victims or the Ripper Escapes card or bluff that they have it.  All of these different aspects work and fit together to make it a very satisfying game.

It's also very portable (being just a deck of cards), and we've played this many times on trips.

RATING: 7
Two things you rarely hear;

'Now you ask, I think you have put some weight on.'

and

'I played Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper correctly the first time.'

Though far from impenetrable the language of the rules booklet puts several obstacles in the way to accesibility (not counting the closeness in shade of two sets of suspect cards though this is moderated by the numbering system).  A simple card game with a nice dose of strategy  to pass an evening with is made difficult with the lack of clarity.  Fortunately the gameplay does not offend so you are keen to play another hand to iron out the errors and after the first few turns you will be rewarded with a card game that produces an engaging narrative and enough opportunities to play a devilish hand.  But I am left with the feeling that a rummy game with an historical narrative which should be ideal to introduce to my parents is now one to pause over.

A very fun game that's thematically dark but plays easily. There's enough strategy to keep it interesting for gamers, but it's still simple enough for anyone to pick up and play.

A good rummy variant seemingly heavy with theme.  I had trouble learning the game from the rules, but I'm not sure if it is me or the rules that are dense.  Seems like it is actually an easy game to learn from someone else and I was just trying too hard.  The cards themselves are very stiff and difficult to shuffle--on the upside they're quite durable as well.

This game required a couple of rules reviews and BGG files before the first play.  That being said, the rules are readable, and the text on the cards makes gameplay a bit easier.  The cards are thick and a bit difficult to shuffle.  The game is great fun, and was one of the few that my wife asked to play again after we completed two rounds.  

Here is my review....

...and a session report.
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/275895

In a recent game, I called a vote before my last draw.  I guessed wrong even though I had all the info at my disposal.  Rachel guessed correctly, and won the game by 5 points.  Had I not called a vote, I would have won!  This is a good example of how avoiding mistakes is as important as finding the right plays.

Better than Jekyll and Hyde as there is more variety and more layers compared to that. I might see this hitting the table more often than Jekyll & Hyde.

Again nothing more than a filler, still won't rate it very high. Not a bad way to pass your time if you have nothing else to do. Portable and hence can be carried around.

This is a solid, light game that builds on Rummy without altering it so much as to be unrecognizable. I like the graveyard-sifting mechanic (Scenes), the Alibis, and the voting -- there's quite a bit going on, but it's still easy to pick up and quick to play. It also manages to pack a surprising amount of both tactics and strategy into each hand.

The presentation is gorgeous, the cards are thick and durable, and I love the overall feel and mood of the artwork.

RATING: 8
An excellent quick game.  A great twist on the old family game of rummy.  Still bound to the usual lucky draws, but fun anyhow.  Plays very well with 3.  Have now played it a number of times as a 2 player filler, fun still.

RATING: 7
When I first acquired this, I did not expect to find such a rich game. It is certainly not as rules-light as I was lead to believe. Granted the game plays simply and smoothly, but there are numerous strategies to employ, all of which are balanced beautifully. Mike Fitzgerald has created a brilliant twist to a familiar card game style.

More than rummy.  It took a few rule read-throughs and practice games before we felt confident we were playing and scoring correctly.  But we then went on to play for 4 hours straight -- when we realized there was about 4 1/2 hours until our alarm was going to ring, we reluctantly stopped (but even then it was difficult to put the deck down!).  There's a lot to this, but it's worth it and entirely enjoyable.  Can't wait to play again.

Since from my childhood if I hear the word 'rummy' for some reasons I instantly feel the scent of lavender and immense boredom. Fortunately Mike Fitzgerald could dismantle the game and made an excellent variant with less collecting and endless waiting for the right card to show up, and much more tools to work with, so it's much more about subtle manipulation, than set collection.

RATING: 7
Presentation is a bit drab, but fits the theme. Bottom line is it is Rummy with 1. some thematic conditional rules arbitrating when cards can be played, 2. addition of a bonus/optional scoring "gamble" that may boost your score over opponent(s) if executed under the right conditions, 3. additional end-round conditions, and 4. more complicated scoring system. Enjoyable filler that aims to mitigate some of the luck of Rummy, although the degree to which it does that is somewhat debatable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Fun light game for all the family. Would be a good gateway game to heavier card games for someone who has only played traditional card games like Rummy and Whist. Doesn't feel like Rummy feels more like a proper card game ;)

I initially rated this a 6- "completely luck driven Rummy variant", I said. Boy did I blow that call. This game has opened up for me in a BIG way thanks to having a regular playing partner in my wife, who LOVES the game. There's luck, yes, but it matters far less than I originally thought- the interplay between suspects, alibis, and calling the vote is subtle and often brutal, not to mention the great mini-game of Jack escaping. Don't listen to old me; this one's a classic.

A very clever design, breathing all kinds of new life into tired old rummy. My favorite of the [i]Mystery Rummy[/i] games, it has a great atmosphere, perhaps too good: I try not to think about the grisly subject matter. Plays very well with two. Timing the vote for suspect moment is tricky, making this game tougher on beginners than the others in the series. The "Ripper Escapes" possibility adds another rich dimension to the game. [15 plays]

I would [i]never[/i] suggest it, but you don't have to pull my teeth to play it either. I like it. For a quick, light card game, it gets no real complaint from me.

That said, I'm not sure this is all that much more interesting than Gin Rummy. The theme and presentation is nice, but the added rules make this more difficult to teach than it's worth. As such, it's best for us as a couples game (We both know the rules already), but for anyone else, I'd just opt for the traditional card game.

RATING: 2
Bad card quality. Bad art (very ugly illustrations). Bad graphic design (two of the suits are very similar colors).

The gameplay is very light with very shallow strategy. That wouldn't be so bad if the rules weren't a complete train wreck. The rulebook is almost unreadable, but that only slows down learning the overly complicated rules. There are piles of rules and exceptions for no reason. These extra rules do not increase the depth or enjoyment of the game. Why is there a dual use alibi card? Why have only four letter cards that don't act like other evidence cards? Why are the scoring rules so complicated?

I think standard rummy is a better game, because it has more strategy per minute and has the proper amount of complexity to such a light game.

Absolutely engrossing take on Rummy. I really like the Al Capone entry in this series, but Jack the Ripper is an animal all its own. It's been a long time since I've played such an intricate, thematic, and tense card game that felt so rewarding. This game is almost 20 years old, and it feels like it could have come out today. The rules could have been written better, and some might feel it's a little too constrictive with how you're able to play cards, but I think that this is easily the best game in the Mystery Rummy series. Definitely not for amateurs to Rummy though.

Card draw luck is a little too high. There are some interesting decisions to be made, but the game tends to favor whoever can either draw the Ripper Escapes card to control the game with victim cards or scene cards or just lucky evidence draws to run out of cards sooner than your opponent can.

I like that you play to 100 points, but each hand is still too luck driven for me. I do like how the theme is integrated into a rummy style game, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

We really liked the game.  Rummy-like game, but sets make suspects guilty and guessing who will be jack gives you points.  So far in our three games we have not been able to use the Jack escapes card.  I will try to play the card next time I play.

Fun rummy game that I enjoy a lot.  Nice in that I can get my parents and wife to play.  Superior to Escape from Alcatraz, the only other Mystery Rummy title I've played.


Execrable rules that make the game more difficult to learn than it should be.  Use the write-ups on BGG instead.

Enjoyable rummy twist, but actually not in the same league as the classier Bonnie & Clyde. There's only really one strategy, and the presentation is eye-searing and confusing by turns. However, you can't fault the theme and the way it's been put to use.

I seem to be alone in finding it more interesting with 3 players.

This game is a little complicated and takes a couple of plays before it begins to make sense.  Some of the aids posted on the Geek are a great help in this respect.  When we weren't playing correctly, it wasn't all that fun.  Once we got it, that made all the difference.  I wish I had more opportunities to play this and work on strategy.  In addition to being a lot of fun, the components are very attractive.  The woodcut artwork on the cards and box is appropriately sinister, and the little ribbons that help you pull out the cards are a nice Victorian touch.  (5+5)

Played it again with wife after many years. Totally forgot about how bad the rulebook was but made me realize how interesting this game is. Left her feeling bored after awhile but we at least managed to get through one game. Went online to download some useful resources which I will bring it out again the next time I try it with probably my son first, then a 3 player game.


Wife doesn't dig this as much as I thought she would due to the theme. Tried it with another friend, thought it was ok in gameplay.

RATING: 7.1
This is another great rummy game! A normal rummy game...except! You are trying to catch Jack before he escapes! In this game you are unable to lay a meld until a victim is played. If all 5 victims happen to be played, then Jack can escape! An Alibi card can be played on a matching set of evidence cards which eliminates that suspect. Only one Alibi can be in play at a time! The historical info. on each card adds to the game as well!

RATING: 8
Downsides first: uninspired name, makes it sound a bit dull; cards made out of some sort of unbendable Teflon making shuffling difficult (and actually painful); colour palette a bit limited - there are two shades of Mustard and a sort of Mustardy-orange, you don't have to be colour-blind to struggle.

Up sides: easy to explain, quick to play, there is tension and strategy but a thick dollop of luck which means you don't get too worked up if your carefully laid plans dump you on your bum. Really good as a two player game. One if my wife's favorites.

RATING: 7.5
Got this for $1.50 at Savers.  We've only managed to play one abbreviated hand so far.  There are a lot of little rules to get your mind around and you don't do them each turn like a board game, so it's harder to remember.  Well, for us anyway.  Looks fun.  We just need to find some time to play.  Missing 3 evidence cards AND The Ripper Escapes card.

Update:  We played to 100 tonight not using the Jill cards and finally realized The Ripper Escapes card wasn't there.  I must have mistaken a Ripper Strikes card when I went through the deck.  This is fun!   We like the give-and-take special functions of the cards, the different ways to score, and the quasi-historical order you must play them in.  My wife was mad when I jumped ahead early, but she then emptied her hand quickly, leaving me holding a lot of points twice in a row.  We had one hand where all the suspects got out early and I realized how suspenseful the Ripper Escape will be.  This will also be better with three or four people.

The special action cards elevate the game over Rummy. The nice thing over other Mystery Rummys is that it presents you reasons not to play your gavel cards. In others, your plays to pick up more cards, search the deck, etc, have little repercussion and they're automatic plays. Here they may be stolen for points or activate alternate scoring conditions not to your advantage. You may want to hold on to bigger scoring cards to prevent a particular suspect (meld) from being biggest and stop it scoring double. Lots of choices. The other twist is that once each hand a vote can be held on which will be the biggest scoring meld, writing down your secret choice for bonus points. This provides another avenue for interesting play, especially if you're about to play an alibi on the current biggest scorer, hence negating the bonus. The game may work best with 3, as this drives up competition for this vote which otherwise feels a little forced in a 2 player. The alternate ending (playing the ripper escapes card when all 5 victim cards are out, scoring big-time) provides the last source of tension which makes it interesting - do I play victim cards out for extra cards and provide the opportunity for someone else, or do I hold onto them and deny. The link to theme is excellent in terms of presentation and graphics. This game is the first and probably the best of the series.

So far this has been a disappointment. It seems like luck plays a far larger role than in other card games we like (like Jaipur). Good hand and good draws = win. There are some tough choices about discards, but overall so far I'm not that impressed.

The theme is a bit stronger than I was expecting, meaning it's a bit less like rummy than I had expected, which is a nice bonus.

Great game, but it&#039;s only rummy. WRONG! Brilliant theme, and some interesting twists make this one of the best 2 player games ever. I prefer Jekyll and Hyde, though, as the gameplay is more streamlined.

All of these games are about killing, so it&#039;s a shame that they aren&#039;t gory enough to satisfy my bloodlust. However, that&#039;s a minor point as you are free to supply your own theatrics.

An excellent Rummy variant for fans of traditional card games.  The gavel cards add just enough decision making and twists to separate it from generic Rummy.  The flavor text is well done and several of the actions have a thematic feel to them.  The deck seems as if it is optimal for two players, though, and it is an excellent 2 player game.

As a side note,  I find this game to be much better than the only "un" official member of the series I have played so far, which was Wyatt Earp.  I also find this to be much better than Fitzgerald's biggest hit to date, Baseball Highlights 2045.

(2 plays) A fun, themed version of rummy.  The cards work out well, and the theme actually works and makes sense.  Melds = evidence.  When you find a victim, you get two cards (clues).  If you investigate a crime scene, you get to pick a card out of the discard pile (a better clue).  This game works a lot better than I thought it would, and is actually a FUN version of rummy.

As I've hit the 7th play, my fiancee finally got her head around this game and she said it's a 7/10 now. It didn't hurt when one afternoon we decided to play Rummy with a deck of cards. I think that helped her clicked with this game.

Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper is a rummy variant that adds one-off special cards to the standard set-collection. It's tied in nicely with its theme: melds represent evidence against one of the possible suspects, and there's an alternative game-end condition to add suspense. Traded away 12/09 as it really wasn't much more interesting than playing regular rummy.

RATING: 5
Unfortunately, I find traditional rummy -- Gin Rummy, Rummikub, Canasta -- far more strategically compelling than Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper, despite JtR's far more complicated rules.

The rules that come with JtR are awful. For example, it's very confusing when the discard pile is referred to as Scotland Yard -- several pages *after* the term Scotland Yard is used! The organization the rules is the biggest reason why they are so hard to understand.

Still, once players have figured out how the game works, it does offer very good narrative tension -- although this tension is simplistic to what you'd find in Gin Rummy. In traditional rummy games, the tension is subtle since you have to deduce which cards your opponents' are trying to meld and play accordingly. In JtR, the rules for melding are much more restrictive. This makes the game less subtle, yet it makes strategies more apparent. One of the main strategies is trying to play the The Ripper Flees card, which is worth 35 points. All that's required is for five other "victim" cards to be played. It's actually thrilling to try to accomplish this task since it's so difficult. 

JtR is a game I wouldn't request, but I'd be happy to play it if someone else asks for it.

decent rummy variant. there are some cool ideas present in the game. fans of rummy games should be quite pleased. 

my main gripe with the game is that a hand can slow to a crawl and be pretty fruitless if the victim cards get stuck at the bottom of the deck. even with addition of the ripper strikes cards-which were a nice addition that attempt to combat this problem-it can sometimes be hard to get a victim in play. it doesn't happen all the time, but it happens more that every once in a while. still, it's a decent game. probably much more enjoyable if you are a bigger fan of rummy than i am.

While I am (or at least used to be) very fond of traditional card games, Rummy was always one I disliked - in any shape or form (Gin Rummy is tolerable, though). I've only played this once, and was surprised how complicated the rules seemed to be and how far from basic Rummy it was - although the basic principle is obviously still there. I'm not in any rush to play this again, but it seemed like this probably is a game worth playing, if not very often.

Powerfully addictive, compulsively addictive.

I think what Fitzgerald did is, he took the exciting part about rummy (going out) and amped it up, added all this wild dramatic binary stuff (who's the ripper? double points for you!) and the even wilder ripper escapes mechanism, which is tricky and risky to pull off but negates all the usual points.

I've played this for 6 hours straight, when me and the girlfriend had colds both. Totally satisfying.

My favorite of the Mystery Rummy games, Jack the Ripper is a real winner.  I have gotten several non-gamers excited about this as well.  Unlike Jekyll and Hyde where the rummy game suffers a bit from the theme mechanics, JtR really does a great job of enhancing the core game.  Emphasis is on big tricks and clever play, while keeping certain cards out of your opponents hand.  I also enjoy that there are multiple ways to win this one.

Meh. That's all this makes me think of. The artwork is meh, the gameplay is meh, and the feel is meh. Played this five times with the wife and could not see the "deep layers of strategy not readily apparent" that Terry Egan among others found.

Contrary to many though, I didn't find the rulebook laughably confusing, but that may be because I'd read the rules on BGG beforehand.

RATING: 6
Ignore the dull title (seriously, the name 'Mystery Rummy' put me off for months) - this is a fun, reasonably accessible card game which takes rummy mechanisms and adds a bit more flavour and intuitive scoring. 

Weirdly, new players always struggle with the rules a bit. Already knowing rummy seems to help, but it's certainly not required.

All it took was a couple of hands of this, and I was hooked. I played a lot of rummy as a kid - my grandparents were big on card games and we played every chance we got.

This is rummy with a twist. Instead of your traditional suits, you have victims, suspects, scenes and evidence from the grisly Whitechapel murders which you meld and layoff to try and catch the Ripper. If the victims all come out before the end of the game the Ripper might escape - and there could be big bonus points for one player.

Although this is supposed to be playable with up to 4 players, I really would only play it with two. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Like gin rummy, lacking melds by sequence, but adding a variety of scoring mechanisms. Evidence melds can't be played until a victim is out. Suspects and alibis can't be played until their matching evidence meld is out. Scenes and victims go together, and who ever plays the 2nd of the pair takes over both cards. The suspect with the most points on it is declared the Ripper at game end and receives double points. Unless the Ripper Escapes after all five murders take place, then that lucky player gets a 35 point bonus. Rules were a little confusing to learn at first, and optimal strategy is not entirely clear, but it's a fairly quick and easy game to play. I don't like the voting phase of the game because it doesn't seem to add much, so I usually just omit it. The cards in the edition I own are really thick and stiff, which makes for difficult shuffling.

I may have set my expectations too high based on other reviews. I like it more than classic rummy games, to be sure. But I'm afraid that's not saying very much.

The game's mechanics and strategic opportunities are shaped by its theme. This works well for the most part, and it does make it easier to remember how to play. However, the mystery aspect to the theme, where you attempt to build a case against suspects via melds, is undermined by the need to play several hands during the course of the game. Any sense you may have that you're solving a mystery is quickly dispelled when, in the very next hand, you solve the exact same mystery with different results. I suspect I would find the game more satisfying if the Ripper were unmasked at most once per game, at the very end.

RATING: 7
One of the few Rummy variants I actually enjoy. I've only played with 2 players so far and would like to play with 3 or 4 where the voting rule may come into play more. 4/21: Played with 4 players, enjoyed the game tremendously and actually used the voting rules. Much better with four.

RATING: 6.5
In general, I really do like rummy games.  I get really annoyed playing them, especially ones that penalize players because they were unlucky enough to get stuck with cards in their hands.  That being said, the theme of this game is engaging enough that I am willing to play it.

RATING: 5
Not particularly impressed after playing a single hand. Rummy is Rummy, and all the weird kinks this game puts into it doesn't really make it better after all the unintuitive complexity it adds on. A particular disappointment for me was the complete detachment of theme and mechanisms. The game tries really hard to be themed, but fails at it because the gameplay is completely abstract. It's like watching a whore going over the top with a schoolgirl outfit for Halloween.

I do like the idea of 2 mini-games within the game though, and balancing which objective to go for. Seems to me that in more traditional forms of Rummy, one person is lucky and the other person isn't. At least the unlucky person has something else to aim for besides minimizing point losses in hand.

I did not have any knowledge of rummy prior to playing this game, so learning the game from reading the rules alone was a nightmare. (This wins the award for the most misleading directions in a rulebook - 'You can treat this as two games in one!' is NOT the same as 'There are two ways you can win this game.') Thank goodness for the helpful FAQ in the Files section. My group notoriously remembers this as 'the game where learning the rules takes longer than playing the game'.

Messy rules aside, it's a great light tactical game, with tension running high as players try to go out before the Ripper escapes. The dated artwork really appeals to some players and it's also an interesting history lesson.

This may have been the first Mystery Rummy game but it sure isn't the best.

Wyatt Earp still offers the best multiplayer option. Jekyll and Hyde is best with 2. Jack the Ripper falls in between. It has the usual melding aspects but often, a lucky hand dominates play. The card effects contain some nice thematic linkage (double points for suspect with the most points), alibis that negate suspects. Fun but can be frustrating. Would rather play Wyatt Earp with 3/4 or Jekyll and Hyde with 2.

The Jack the Ripper version of Mystery Rummy was certainly more fun than standard Rummy, but after two dozen or so plays, it just didn't have much staying power.

It's rummy with a twist.  It is a nice twist, but it is still rummy.  There are some things about the game that irritate me, outside of the fact that I don't like rummy, I don't like how the gavel cards tie up your hand or how late victims stall the progress of the game.  If I didn't already think that rummy was dreadfully boring I might give this a higher rating.

I can't imagine ever wanting to play this again.

Fun rummy variant. I love the box: not overly large; sturdy; with appropriate-sized card holders and little ribbon-things to easily pull out the cards; looks like a little book!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
It's rummy (draw a card from draw pile or discard, opt to play a meld, discard a card; first to empty hand wins) with a theme. Most cards that you'll meld are "evidence" cards. There are also "gavel" cards - you may only play 1 gavel per turn from your hand (so it may be a bit harder to "go out" than regular rummy). There are 5 victim cards (gavel cards). At least 1 victim must be played before players are allowed to play evidence cards (each color of evidence card is evidence against one of the suspects). Gavel cards generally do something cool - e.g., draw more cards, search the discard pile for a card, flip up to 5 cards until a victim is revealed/played, etc. The hand ends when someone goes out, or when Jack escapes (a card that any player can play the instant all 5 victims are played; it's worth 35 points and makes all melds played worth 0). If Jack doesn't escape, he's caught: the person with the most evidence on the board against them is named Jack, and those cards are worth double the usual points. Tally up the points. Keep playing hands till someone gets to 100+; winner is the player with the fewest points.

Only game that ever led to a fight.  I tried explaining this game to my in-laws while on vacation.  I went through the cards and explained alias and alibi's but my sister-in-law got angry and wanted to know the strategy she should use.  I explained no one knew because none of us had ever played the game before.  We'll try a test hand and see how it goes.  She refused to let it go which I couldn't understand.  She threw a fit and stormed off. It was weird to say the least.  Needless to say, the game never made it to the table.... ever.  But its still a funny joke from time to time. "Rummy anyone?" brings out snickers with the family.  Looked like a great game.

[many plays] I have enjoyed rummy and rummy based game since I was a child.  So I love these mystery rummy series games.  Very clever interesting theme that fits well around the basic rummy game.  I like the theme in this mystery rummy, better than the Edgar Alan Poe story in mystery rummy #2.  I think that some of the complaints regarding the Jack the Ripper escapes card are founded.  That card can swing the game a lot and can be annoying.  However, I won't go so far as to say it breaks the game, if players are aware of it and play smart it really just adds something to watch for that can be fun.  I would play this card game over many many other card games, but just in terms of ranking on this site, I just in general enjoy board games more than card games.

[U.S. Games 2003 edition] {couple, murder; rummy-variant, speculation; optimal 2p} MR1 is a thematic family card game. It's quite interactive and fun. It's fast-paced, too. The rules are intuitive and easy to learn. The "voting" and "Ripper Escape" mechanics provide the tactical elements and intrigues of the game. Luck is not important in MR1; tactical play is more important.

The illustration of the cards is ok for me. I like the information on the card very much. It really enhances the game experiences.

[The MR series]   In order, my preference for multiplayer game - MR4 = Wyatt Earp > MR2 > MR1.  In order, my preference for 2p game - MR3 > MR1 > MR2 > MR4 = Wyatt Earp > MR3.

Played many times with 2, however, never with more than that (although I'd like to).  However, for 2 players, this is a very strategic game, with the additional "Is he holding the Ripper Escapes card?" or "Should I keep the Ripper Escapes even though he only has 3 cards left?" sub-game keeping things tense even in hands that would otherwise seem to be straightforward.  When I introduce the game to new players, I leave out the voting aspect, and introduce it later.

This is the best rummy game, ever.  Light enough to play while watching television, but the mechanics allow for some mildly interesting strategy.  Now, if only I could get my in-laws to put down Phase-f-ing-10 long enough to give this a chance.

As somewhat of a historic crime buff, I love the details of this game.  Once you get a couple tricky rules down, it plays fast.  Much better than plain rummy, which is it's base--definitly need to pay attention to what the other players are doing. If you get too involved in your own strategy, you're lost. (Have played several times, but have only recenlty begun recording game plays).

RATING: 8
Extremely fun Rummy variant card game. Really adds a nice twist to Rummy. Only played a few times, but it seems like the person who has the Ripper Escapes card almost always wins the hand, making it way too valuable relative to the other cards. Still, it's a very nice way to spend an hour playing a full game.

Like Rummy, but with more interesting interactions and special cards that allow for clever play and risk/reward. Almost a perfect game for my wife and I. Four or five hands completes an entire game, it's got multiple paths to beating your opponent's score, and it's rummy, so my wife would dig it no matter what.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The quicker play time, coupled with the rummy ties translated into a decent hit at our house.  We can play a game as well as have conversation, which these days is a great deal.  

As for the gameplay itself, it is very straightforward, and has deceptive depth to it.  It is a port of rummy, so the mechanics are familiar (melds, hits, etc.).  However, there are several tweaks that make the game interesting, and give it a decent amount of replayability.  

2 player can have a small bit of predictability from one hand to the next, but not in every single hand.  Artwork is incredibly good, and the historical text at the bottom of the cards is interesting.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Once you get past the badly written rules, this is a good version of rummy for two players. It's basically just Rummy with cards that allow for some extra options, like being able to pick cards from the discard pile or even taking a cards from an opponent in some cases.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 2[/b]
Really interesting with 2 because every card you discard could potentially be the one card that your opponent is waiting to grab. That element is lost with more players because the cards will be more spread out among your opponents.

Update: Moving this up to a 10. It's rummy, sure, but the nice-looking cards and the special actions (from gavel cards) make it a lot of fun to play. I've only played two-players so far, so not sure how it plays with more.

This one has some really engaging ideas integrated into a standard card game focusing on the trials and tribulations of a mass murderer.  So the fact that the game play, for the most part,  is convoluted - should come as no surprise,  given the premise.  

Not to worry though,  the theme serves a purpose, as it will soften the blow,  when somewhere, in the not too distant future,  he will come to be comfortably known,  as simply,  Mr. Jack.

RATING: 7
Similar to Lost Cities, I like the game play but I'm not a fan of the tacked on theme.  It adds up to a spiced up version of regular Rummy, but with colors instead of numbers, while having to follow suits of Victim, Evidence and Suspect.  An interesting alternative to a regular deck of cards.

The theme works wonderfully with the rummy game.  Loads of fun, and so far my wife's most requested game.  Can't get her to stop beating me at it, though.

9-2-08: I still like and appreciate this game, but two things make me downgrade it to a 7 from the 8 it's held for 2 years: first, the card stock is unbearably heavy, which shouldn't affect the way I feel about the game but really does; second, I'd rather play something else with 2, like Lost Cities, Blue Moon, etc.

RATING: 8
Comment after one player (second game I've played in the series after Wyatt Earp).  I prefer this much better to Wyatt Earp, the gavels instead of the luck filled bullet holes is excellent.  The "shot the moon" type mechanic of the Ripper Escapes is just an amazing addition.  I will rate it a 7 now, but I somehow think with repeat plays this will sky rocket upwards.  This has amazing couples game written all over it.

Digging it even more with my second play.... up a point to an 8.

The voting mechanic makes this game a keeper.  The 3 times I call a vote are 1.  I am about to go out and I know who it will be(normally you will share the bonus with your opponents but you need to do this to insure your opponent can't rely on it being the other 2 reasons) 2.  You have hidden information which will be played to the table soon.  3.  To help manipulate your opponent to giving you double points on a melded sets.
I have only played 7 times and keep learning new tricks, so this isn't locked in stone for me.  

Against a regular opponent there are many tricks such as discarding a card you are collecting, to help encourage a discard.  Then scoop up the discard, lay down a scene and bam easy peasy lemon squeezy.  Anyways, I'm rambling now, but this allows for some fun hand management.

Just started playing this one for the first time, having previously played (and enjoyed) Numbers 2 (Murders in the Rue Morgue) and 3 (Jekyll & Hyde) in the Mystery Rummy series. As others have said, have found the rules a bit to get your head round at first, but even after one full game (3 hands), things seem to be slotting into place and me and the wife are getting more confident with it. Currently I feel Murders in the Rue Morgue probably just edges it over this, but I can easily see how I could reverse this view over time as we get more comfortable with the rules and deploying more strategy, which I feel there is probably more potential for in this game.

RATING: N/A
Fun rummy game, the headliner amongst all the advanced rummy games now available. I liked the rule that makes the Ripper suit worth more, and the way only one alibi card can be in play which causes you to jockey back and forth with your opponent for the suit you want the Ripper to be.

Unfortunately, at it's heart, it's still rummy, and my wife will kill me every time at it. But much much better than just playing normal rummy with a standard deck of cards.

Nice for multiplayer Rummy, but for two players, I actually prefer Jekyll and Hyde or Crazy Chicken.  I like the variety of play, and all the twists to the scoring, but the ways that some suspects score is a little convoluted, and doesn't translate well to non-gamers.  For those who like their fillers with teeth, though, this is your game.

This was a fun take on a rummy game.  I liked the extra level of play that the gavel cards added to the game. We played a five round 2P game, and each round seemed to end fairly quickly with the start player always going out first...I'm not quite sure if this is normal. Hopefully it was just a fluke. 

UPDATE:  When we played again, the person that started the hand did not always go out first.  Yeah!

RATING: 6
Who knew basic Rummy could drive such a thematic game experience? Searching through the "case files" and drawing cards to play to your tableau truly feels like you are a detective looking for clues. All the scoring mechanics make sense as well, particularly the "Ripper escapes!" scoring condition that occurs when all five bodies are put into play before anyone "goes out" and solves the murder with an arrest. It's both simple and fascinating...and the scores tend to come in big, so even playing to a hundred points only takes a couple of hands. If your partner isn't too bothered by the grim-dark theme, than this is one of the best two player games out there.

This game has seen a lot of play time in my house.  Once we got the hang of playing it, it now comes out pretty regularly.  Have only played it with two players. Tried to teach it to another couple for a four player game and it did not go well.  Part of the problem was I did not organize my verbal instructions very well.  The other reason is that the game does have a learning curve and one of the other players is not into any games that exceed the "lighter" category.  You really have to read the directions and put an evening aside to play a few practice rounds.  But, once you get it down, it is a great concept with a great theme.  I highly recommend this game.

My biggest hangup is the rules, they are awful in how intimidating they look for such a damn simple game. Just play a regular game of rummy, then read about the two types of cards, Evidence and Gavel cards, you may only play one Gavel card a turn, read up on voting in the rules, and then just play. The rules for all cards are summarized better on the cards themselves than in the rules.

05/11/06 - RATING 7:  Jack the Ripper is really one of the true workhorses of modern gaming.  It's a quite solid design with interesting options (for being a rummy game), it's portable and has little game-overhead.  It's the sort of game that anyone can pull out when nothing else can be decided upon and everyone is bound to enjoy themselves.  While I think Wyatt Earp fills exactly the same niche, I think Jack the Ripper is a more interesting game due to the The Ripper Escapes sub-game, which is why Jack the Ripper gets a 7 where Wyatt Earp gets a 6.  

PREVIOUSLY:
Played once.  I don't know why anyone would rather play this so long as Wyatt Earp was still in print.

Update (8-12-04) Played some more times and my opinion has drastically improved.  New opinion of game:  good.  Alternate victory condition regarding the escape of the Ripper provide for a tense game in which no one really knows if all of the cards they've been playing will go to waste.  Awesome.

Wallace does Ameritrash. Actually not quite true because many of his games feel like hybrids and the scoring mechanism for this is totally euro but the theme is totally unlike anything he's done before. ok game but not up there with an AoS or Brass.

RATING: 8
A half-euro, half-ameritrash monster rampage game.  Fun and strategic, although a run of bad dicerolls can be pretty brutal.  Artwork is great, and the labelled wooden bits are nice enough also.  Fun, and reasonably fast game.

Note: Print Run = 650

This is such a fun game.  Has good mechanics with a really great theme and is a ton of fun to play with like minded people.  A good blend of euro mechanics and production with direct conflict and a kitschy monster theme.

I am really excited to see how the new version turns out.

The theme sounds fun, so now I just have to remember to kickstart this when it goes up. 

Seems cool, will probably never get it.  Wouldn't mind playing it sometime, though, to see if it's worth doing a print and play or something.

Wow. Excellent game. Like any game with dice, bad rolls can be a problem, but there are so many ways to interact (and you roll so often!) that I think luck is actually a pretty small factor. Rules are... not complex, but strange, making it a bit awkward to play at first? But the game is a ton of fun, great mix of eurogamey-area-control and dice-chucking smash-stuff games.

Quite frankly I'm baffled that this game hasn't received more buzz. This is a great design wich offers an amazing degree of subtle tactical and stategic play, like in the best Wallace tradition. People who call it "light" for a Wallace just crack me up. They just don't get the subtle complexity. It is a brainburner if you play it hardcore.
It's great how the game becomes more and more intense towards the finale. Every action counts and for a game that uses dice for some of its central mechanics, the game is surprisingly balanced.
One of the best area-control/majority games I played in a long time. This should be in the top 200.

----------------------

Not being a huge Martin Wallace fan, I didn't have great expectations, but I had fun.  This game is unique, with a very neat theme.  Has some interesting choices, but there is a ton of dice rolling (although I didn't mind it).  Want to try this again with 4 players and see how it compares.

Its a pretty cool, Wallaced-out Monsters Menace America, but you know, across the world. The wood bits work fine, but some plastic monsters would be super awesome. (FFG reprint?) Drafting from the action pool feels very Wallace-y, and has a nice tension. The hidden info regarding your city you want to avoid smashing is kinda lame, as you dont have a ton of control over that, but makes for mosre interesting endings, I guess.

Too ponderous for a monster game.  It's clever in parts, especially with how passing is handled, but 2/3rds of the way through I could not wait for the game to be over.

Worst Kickstarter experience I have had.  Over two years late.  The hero minis are molded in the same color as the soldiers, so they are difficult to tell apart, which is just cheap.  Paid $60 for it on Kickstarter.  CoolStuffInc sold them a month before I ever got my copy and for $49!  A few months later they blew them out for $19.95.

RATING: 7
An excellent cross of Euro mechanics with Ameritrash style smash-stuff-up-with-D6's gameplay!  I've played this a handful of times now, and have seen different strategies work pretty well in each of them.

What was furthermore indicative of this game's potential success is that I've played this with 12 different people, and every single one of them asked where they could buy it!

Overall, I really enjoyed this one, and it's just fun to have a Euro with a cool theme that plays very well.

I had an enjoyable time playing this game, taking sub-optimal moves just because they were fun.  This is one of those games where playing the game is more fun than actually trying to be the winner (not that I'm not trying to win, but who can pass up blowing up somebodies Mechnoor with 4 damage on it even it if doesn't directly better your position).  Either way, the game is quite enjoyable.  The downside is that there is a lot of chaos.  I fear that with secret city objectives, the cities that don't get targeted first give their owners a big lead, and that is just completely random.

Rock solid game.  One of the cleanest Wallace designs of recent memory.

It feels like it should have a huge debt towards other games, but most of the machinery here is new, or at least, so hard to recognize that it might as well be new.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Moongha Invaders is an odd little title, in some ways it reminds me of Tyranno Ex, not in the particular mechanics, but because it's a game made by a designer better known for more serious games who in this case has opted to do a lighter, but still interesting dice roller.

The game is actually pretty straight-forward for a Wallace title. Players build monsters, ravage cities and put down military units and heroes to defend cities that they have a secret end game scoring interest in, or to just harry their opponents in general.

The game is governed by 6 action boxes that are semi-randomly seeded at the start of each round. Actions like building monsters and attacking are always at least moderately available, whereas the mix of military units available can vary considerably.

The main way of scoring victory points is to have your monsters get the majority of "ravaging cubes" (no idea what they're actually called) in as many cities as possible. Thus, the game has some races, and also can see some fierce player competition for majorities.

The monsters available are a curious mix, most of them have special powers, and the monsters that take more "create" points to build are also more gifted in some way, mostly by being able to throw more dice for each attack action, but some of them in other ways (i.e.: additional moves, can attack with another monster, &c.)

The main drawback I see with it is the relatively static board positions that seem to develop because of the slow, action governed movement. Games like Wallenstein/Shogun bother me for the same reason, as there seems to be an illusion of more going on than there actually is in many cases.

I had never even heard of this game prior to playing it, but I was pleased with it. It's fairly quick playing for a Wallace game and should be fun as long as you come into it and play it in the correct spirit. It does have more gamey, Euro elements and scoring than it seems most American dice chucker fans would like (as such, I'm shocked that so many American-style game fans are crazy for it), but for Euro and Wallace fans who are looking for something lighter and dicey but who still want some interesting decision space, this offers up a good option. Pity about the high secondary prices.

Update: I have the Kickstarter edition, which of course sucks. I have no idea why Martin had to go add huge unwieldy plastic pieces rather than the eminently more functional wooden discs. Anyway, the game didn't live up to my memory of it from when I played the original. But it's still decent if played with an AmeriTrash / Euro attitude.

---

Um, why is it that every time there's a Martin Wallace game I want, I can't reasonably find it without spending an arm and a leg? But this tops it all. This game, unlike virtually all previous MW games, is not a serious game. It's about building monsters and attacking cities and other monsters throughout the world. And it's fun! Honestly, I'm not even sure how good of a design it is. I didn't really stop to think too much about it. I was too busy having fun! It seems this game was for sale on the Treefrog site, but isn't for sale anymore. Great. I guess I'll have to be happy with trains and stuff from social studies classes.

Plenty of fun to be had here. Only one exploratory game so far, won by 5 year-old Christopher with his "build a Mechoor and just keep attacking" strategy which ended the game in turn 5 as he exhausted his cubes. Meanwhile I was experimenting with Bloobs & a Spectoor to keep moving & hiding. I was also shielding my cities from Emily's Mechoor & Bloob attacks while she hunted my hidden Spectoor with a Snaggoo & took out my only Drakoor with a Hero.
Nice to have a B-Movie tour-de-force designed by Martin Wallace - it really shows it's provenance.

A fun game - the dice can be unkind but there is a surprising amount of strategy and tactics that can be applied. The turn/action selection mechanics are very clever including the pass.pass-action end turn shenanigans.

The plastic the monsters are made from is a bit rubbish - I can't help feel that wood-block or uber-meeples with stickers would have been better.

Just remember this isn't trying to be 'Brass' - it's a knockabout romp in a comic-book setting which still requires some thought.

Moongha Invaders was a bit of a surprise for me. In general I have very mixed reactions towards Martin Wallace games. I love Age of Steam (it is one of the three games I rate a 10) and find Brass to be interesting (an 8), but have had a much less positive reaction towards his other games. Moongha definitely ended up on the positive side of the equation (with a rating of a 7) rather than the negative.

The game is essentially an action drafting game with an area control/combat mechanic thrown in for flavor. The players go around the table taking turns drafting from several different available actions. This continues until all players pass The quantity of available actions varies randomly each turn, but all the players know which actions are available at any individual round start. If a particular action type is not available than the player can choose to place their marker on that space. This counts as a pass, however, and if everyone else does this (or just chooses to pass) then the round ends.

Combat , monster movement, and monster creation are all based on the selection of these actions as is the response from earth’s defenders. Heroes and military units are similarly placed and activated based on individual player’s actions. 

What motivates players to victory is, like in many games, the accumulation of victory points. How you achieve victory points is based on a number of factors: how much destruction you cause to individual cities, how many other monsters your monster eater consumes, and how effectively you are able to defend your cities.

I found Moongha to be a fairly entertaining take on the action drafting genre, with plenty of interesting decisions and ways that you can attack your opponent’s positions. While the game can be a bit swingy because of the 50% odds die rolls, it did not seem that they outweigh the impact of individual player decisions on the game’s results. Unfortunately, there was nothing about the game that struck me as particularly grand or riveting like the games that have ended up as my favorites. It was not a game that I was thinking about deeply for days after I played it, and while I would like to play it again I am not going out of my way to do so. It may be that this game is simply something that will take a while to excite me.

This is a fantastic game and I'm so happy to have the original Black/White/Red version and not the crap that is the Kickstarter Art. This has a really nice mix of German style mechanics and American style dice rolling and chrome. The package as a whole makes it perhaps the best Monsters Beating up on Cities game. With the world map, different types of monsters, light resource accumulation and management the game is a keeper.

RATING: 6
I consider this to be a light multiplayer conflict game with some area majority and action selection tossed in. The winner is the person that has the most victory points. How do you gain them? Every player has a hidden objective of at least two cities which they try to protect. The less damaged they are, the more points these objectives are worth at the end. When you damage cities you put cubes of your color on the city and at the end each city has typical area majority points distributed based on most damage. You have creatures called Drakoors which are hard to kill and worth VP if they remain segregated from other monsters. Finally, there is a Moogre monster which basically eats your opponents monsters for VP. Actual combat is pretty luck based but the trick is that you can mostly only attack opponents revealed monsters (they come into play hidden). Overall I think it's a decent game, but it's not one for my collection. Rating based on the original edition, whose graphic/component design I preferred.

Sounds like a lot more fun than it is due to the design choice to make it a micro-turn game. This is one of those games where instead of being able to take your ideas and just go make them happen, everything you want to do is chopped up into small (mirco) actions that you have to manage over several turns. This design approach works in many euro games and might feel right in something economic, but here it runs counter to the theme of monsters smashing and bashing and creates an overly restricted experience. 

I’m a fan of action drafting, but here it devolves into tedium because you frequently can’t, you know, [i]do stuff.[/i] Moving your monsters, for example, is an extremely limited option (why is this?), and I didn’t find that groove of excitement for pulling off  slick moves. Instead, you spend several turns building up chits to create a monster, move that monster, and have that monster attack, then roll some dice, and begin the several-turn process all over again. That’s just for one of your monsters. 

Complicating this weakness, there are dice that might undermine all the planning you just patiently went through. [i]Whoops! There’s several turns down the drain.[/i] If I have to wait that long for one action chain to complete, then at least least let me move all monsters or attack with all monsters. My two cents is that the game would be a lot more fun if you could do a lot more.

I Kickstarted this at the end of 2012. It showed up in October of 2015. I had maintained a steady excitement about finally trying this game that so many people on BGG praised in 2010. I have been excited to play this for four and a half years. Reading the rules, funding the game, looking at all the upgrades. It looked amazing. I maintained excitement, even with waiting almost three years after paying for a copy of the game. 

October 20th, 2015: I got my chance.  
It's a pretty decent euro-game, and that's the problem.  The theme is sandpaper against the mechanics. The only exciting elements are the theme and the dice chucking to check for success of destructive actions. What it offers is a slow ratcheting tense buildup of decisions. You see what everyone is doing. Moves are scripted. Everyone can see what each other is doing and plan accordingly. Mechanically, it seems like that should be delicious. 

But the theme is this pile of monsters rampaging and destroying the world. I want to SMASH SMASH SMASH. By the time I get to the smashing, it is a few moves past the point of excitement. And this makes the game drag. It’s a mechanically sound game with the right amount of play for the mechanics. The theme and the cool plastic bits demand action and results. Instead, we are given slow drawn out micro-decisions that, if everyone is paying attention, are pretty obvious by the time they happen.

I will play it again and re-examine my rating. The frustration of wanting something to happen and not caring by the time it did leaves me expecting my rating to stay about the same.

I can already see my rating, of this game going up a little, as I get more plays. This is a perfect blend, of a Euro and Ameritrash game. Oh and did I mention, that it's a LOT of fun to play?

Players build up their monsters strengths and then unleash them on other cities. All while trying to protect their own cities. Quite a few different mechanics are involved in this game, that all blend together perfectly. This is just a pure, flat out fun game. Definitely a good gamers game.

This is a truly excellent game where players have a plethora of strategies to consider both defensive and offensive.  The only reason this game doesn't get a 10 is because the insane amount of dice that are rolled, which can be quite frustrating if they continually don't go your way.  Otherwise, there is almost too much fun packed into one box.  The game has great art, great gameplay, and will be a staple in my collection for the rest of my life.

Awesome blend of euro mechanics and ameritrash theme. Combination of simple dice-based combat, worker placement style limited action distribution, and a lot of bluffing.  Although the game looks and sounds like a combat based dice chucking monster game, it is really more of a resource management area majority game.  Those who buy it hoping for a scifi monster slugfest will be sorely disappointed.  This has more in common with a stereotypical martin wallace than a monster fighting game.  I worry about the reception of the game, because people who want Wallace might be disappointed with the dicefest aspect, but people who want a monster game might be disappointed with the slow resource management / build your VP engine style of the game.

Basically, you are leveraging your limited number of actions to try to score as many VP as possible.  The VP come from a number of sources, but the destruction of cities is the primary scoring mechanism, so you are building monsters and rolling dice to get area majorities in the different cities.  The monsters have different stats and special abilities, and each offers some different strategies.  Alternating between build actions and attack actions is most of the game, as you build your critters and attack cities.  You can also move monsters, place military cubes to attack other players' monsters, and place heros to find the other player's hidden monsters.  

I thoroughly enjoyed this game and had a lot of fun with it, but I went in fully expecting a hybrid oddity, which is what this game is.

Moongha Invaders is a head to head competitive weuro of the type which Martin Wallace does so well.

Wallace blends early incentives to grow with incentives to protect certain cities, as well as a general priority to destroy stuff.

Limited actions, incentive for players to take down other players, hidden knowledge, monsters destroying the world, and after a long wait some fun plastic minis- who could ask more?

Starting at a 7.5, and hoping for more trips to the table soon.

Only 1 play, but definitely enjoy this game.  This is one of those rare games where playing is so much popcorn fun while not being silly that you really don't care if you win or lose.  Creating 50's era type monsters, smashing cities and unleashing military strikes on your enemies is top quality fun no matter how you do.

I think we played pretty poorly in our first game.  Didn't care about that either.  Way fun.

I had a lot of trouble justifying this purchase. Not so much for the cost - small print run and an import to boot, I get it. But I simply doubted that I would like it. I don't care for a majority of Wallace's games that are not published by Warfrog (the very good Rise of Empires is an exception). For the most part they are lighter and I've always thought that Wallace's mechanics are an uncomfortable fit in a lighter format. But as I read up on this game some very interesting things were being said about it and I decided I had to give it a try. Glad I did.

This game is not as light as I feared, nor is it as mechanically awkward. The action-drafting works extremely well giving you legitimate strategic decisions in a simple format. While there is a lot of dice rolling, having the ability to "store up" attack tokens does a great job of mitigation since attacking becomes a time vs. quality decision. The monsters are interestingly different and sometimes work in tandem. The different ways of scoring can lead to different strategic approaches to the game. I actually think this is a great blend of European and American gaming traditions, and reminds me of another game that I really liked in that regard, Chaos in the Old World. Not that the games are mechanically similar (although the primary source for points in Moongha is a majority contest), but they both succeed in marrying mechanics that just a few years ago seemed so at odds.

I can appreciate the degree of silliness here, but in practice the scoring, majorities, action drafting, and attacking/defending are just kind of thin. They don't really provide the zany follow-through that you would expect from the presentation. Taken in isolation they make a pretty generic game. 

I wouldn't call this bad but it's a bit of a head-scratcher. Hard to imagine playing again.

I found this an enjoyable romp with a bit of decision making involved in the game as you seek to be the best mad scientist and destroy cities around the world with your monsters.  Several different ways to gain points leads to several strategies which appear to be valid ways to earn points towards victory.  It sure doesn't take long for an army to grow and become formidable despite being human.  The different characteristics/abilities of the monsters add quite a bit of flavor and variation to the game as you can pursue different strategies with monsters.  Game is easily taught, understood and played, particularly for a Wallace game!

Be aware that you will have to be able to accept 50-50 combat rolls on the dice that may not even out over the course of the game.  If you can't put up with the vagaries of chance in dice rolls, don't play this game.

I liked it even better with 4!

A very untypical theme wise Martin Wallace game that has his typical design behind it. 
A nice tactical with lots of luck type game. the only downside is the withholding attack doesn't make much sense since it doesn't charge your die roll.
Also I like the not passing, passing move.

I play-test the game several times since his developing and I really like it very much. I played also several time with the final rules (but still not with the final arts/pieces). It is a fun game, with some nice innovative mechanic (like most of Martin design) and some dice rolling.
It is a game where players compete for destroing cities also fighiting each other.

Not exactly your typical Martin Wallace. Different types of monsters have different ways to accomplish their goals and thus score points from hiding in the shadows to bashing other monsters over the head and eating them. It doesn't feel like a lot of effort went into this one. It comes out as rather bland.

We played it today for the first time and it was actually very fun. It took ca. 2 hours for our first game.

Found for "decent" price at CardHaus.com... couldn't resist.

Moongha, a lighter Wallace game, is a fun romp. There are monsters with names like Moogre, Drakoor, Shagoo, Kidoo, etc., and twelve dice (12!). Players take turns claiming the limited action tokens to "build" monsters, move monsters, and attack cities, humans, and other monsters. While lighter for a Wallace offering, Moongha offers different strategies to be explored, several which seem viable. There are a few different ways to score points. There is also a good helping of player interaction in this one. Moongha is no multi-player solitaire!

I enjoyed it.  Almost feels like an AT-type game.  Some luck (dice) some randomness (hidden cities), but still lots of interesting choices.  Seems like there are different paths to victory.  Need more plays to assess.

This game is really bad. Imagine playing El Grande, where every time you lined up for a move to place a cube, you needed to roll a 4 or better on a d6. That's pretty much this game. I knew going in there would be dice luck, but I thought the other mechanisms were going to be interesting enough to make up for it. They weren't bad. A diceless variant of this game would probably be enjoyable. As it stands, the experience is slow and unpredictable. Big pass on this one.

Moongha Invaders is a departure from Martin Wallace’s recent themes but it still feels like a Wallace game, and has prompted the usual numbers of rules queries. It moves pleasingly quickly but I wasn’t sure about the balance between the monsters. Would play again but I’m not in a hurry to.

I expected something much heavier from Martin Wallace. Moongha had been on my board game bucket list for way too long. It turns out it is a rather light and silly game. A strange mix of euro action management and loads of dice chucking. Feels like a game from a bygone era, yet surprisingly entertaining. Had a good time shouting monster names while wreaking havoc all over the board. THE BLOOB!

I enjoyed this one a great deal. Seven different characters with different abilities to build up and unleash on some major cities. There's a lot of dice rolling, but that's a good thing because I prefer a lot of dice rolling than important events being decided on just a bit of dice rolling. While it's the thinking persons monster invasion game it's also quick thinking. Decisions are interesting, but you don't need to dwell on them too long. The pace of the game is very attractive to me - boom - that's your turn done, now think about what you want to do while the others take their lightning fast turns and boom you're done again.

There's a very clever passing mechanic going on here where taking a spent action (from six different choices), can be achieved in two turns if there are no more of the action counters left. Careful though because four consecutive passing actions and the round is over. Very simple and it works oh so well.

Can't wait to get this to the table again and again. For me it's one of the very best dice rolling fest games I've played. Totally under the radar for me until the Kickstarter campaign, but I can see why it couldn't stay hidden forever.

A játékos szörnyeikkel próbálják a világ legnagyobb városait a földig rombolni. Szóval mi vagyunk a rosszak. Egymás céljainak megakadályozásában a Föld hadseregei és hősei lesznek a segítségünkre, velük és szörnyeinnkel is tudjuk az ellenfél pusztítóit likvidálni. Minden játékosnak van három célvárosa, amelyet próbál védelmezni, annál több pontot kap értük a végén minél kevésbé rombolódtak le a játék során. A 6 akciólehetőség van a játékban, amelyek választhatósága szerencsefüggően alakul. Kockával dobódik ki minden kör elején, hogy egy alapmennyiségen fölül még mennyi áll belőlük rendelkezésre. A játékosok körükben ezen hat akció megadott számú lehetőségével élnek. Ezek elfogyásakor ér véget a kör úgy, hogy mindenki sorban passzol. De itt egy érdekes ötlet került a játékba. Ha passz korongunkat felhelyezzük, az tulajdonképpen egy adott akcióból egy plusz lehetőség addig, míg nem kerül fel vagy le minden játékos ilyen passz jelölője sorban a tábláról. Így ez is egy taktikai rész a játékban, hogy talán érdemesebb passzolni, hogy a másik fél már ne jöjjön. A játék végén a célvárosaink megvédésén kívül az adott városokban végzett rombolásainkkért kapunk még pontot többségi alapon, illetve a hat szörnyfajtánk közül az egyik táblánlevőségéért. Van olyan szörnyünk, aki más ellenfél megölt szörnyeiért ad pontot. A szörnyek közül volt olyan, amit egyikünk se használt, itt talán még lehetett volna finomítani a kiegyenlítésükön. A támadások sima kockadobással dőlnek el. A játékban szinte mindenhol jelen van a szerencse mégis kiegyenlített lett az első játszma. Talán egy kicsit hosszúnak éreztem a szerencsefaktorához mérten, de érdekes, egyedi volt. Kicsit talán erős ez a pont, de jó élmény volt az első parti.

RATING: 6.5
I want to like it more than I do.  There are some really great ideas here, but it is muddled from too much drudgery from turn by turn set up. There is a good chicken aspect in taking actions when they are available, and there is a real sense of tension in the decisions that you make. Unfortunately, for my taste, it takes so long to get to make a big splash that if you chunder your die rolls or you get wiped out before you can do anything the game becomes very disappointing.  

The fun of playing with monsters is smashing into things. All of the accounting just feel anti-thematic in some way.

I don't mind dice, I often like them in Martin's games, but here they are thrown at the back end of long and deliberate planning, so if somehow you come up with a good plan, navigate through the folly of other player's decisions only to lose on everything (possibly making the last 5 or 8 turns totally pointless) it makes it tough to respect the requirement that it takes to put yourself in a position to win.  Too much luck for the overhead.

Plus moving monsters is so creaky.  There are so few movement chits and when you get them you can only move one (or two if you have Spectoor).  I would love to see more going on across the board. Most of the time monsters just get mired into little zones and never get around. Why not move two creatures naturally and three or 4 with Spectoor?

It needs more movement flexibility, more action, and perhaps some sort of consolation prize. 

The end game really starts to drag and you poke around trying to figure out what a good reactive move is and bide your time. I might even can this last turn.  Maybe it just felt like it was a turn too long.  If I were to get rid of a turn I'd kill the first one.

There was much to like here. It could be a great game.  I'll wait for the house rule fixes.

A lightish (at least compared to what you'd expect from Martin Wallace) action-selection area-majority romp where you get to play mad scientists creating monsters that go SMASH cities all over the world! Great flavor here: cool monster names, nice artwork appropriate for those old timey monster flicks. Fun to play, although the first game (4 newbies, a few wrong rules) ran a bit long.

Would be even better with 3-dimensional (plastic) bits -- I wonder if anyone will make some Sculpey monsters? Or maybe scavenge from other games (e.g., infantry/tanks/planes from Memoir '44)?

Lovely concept. Amazing art. But typical of much of Wallace' work: obtuse rules, with some very dry moments. In my opinion, for what this is, it's been massively overrated. I suspect its rarity has inflated opinions as have fans of the designer.

Usually I don't like unserious games. I mean, I like to have fun of course but that often happens with serious games with important real themes. Occasionaly a game not that serious crosses my table and I enjoy it. Moongha is one of those games.
Players should be prepared for a nonsense random game full of lucky uncontroled elements. But this can be the fun part mainly if players know what they are playing for. A good option when playing for fun only.

Not expecting this to be a bit like Brass, however it's Wallace so automatic purchase for me.

In fact, from read of the rules (Wallace does Ameritrash) i worry this will be like Herbert Von Karajan conducting 'West Side Story' , or watching great uncle Tarquin jiving -  an embarrassing venture outside their natural milieu.

I'm sure gameplay will disprove my theory....and it does.

Every player secretly owns a number of cities on the board, and points are scored from destroying cities owned by other players. Since the attacked cities are often chosen arbitrarily, it's possible for someone to be completely screwed by bad luck and have all their cities destroyed. It also seemed a bit unbalanced, with no strategy comparing to just using a big robot to smash everything.

RATING: 6
[thing=64826][/thing] is mostly an area control game with high confrontation. It is one of the hidrid type of games, since several of its mechanics bring an euro flavor, like the action selection, while others are heavy ameri-game/wargame, mostly in the combat, with a big quantity of dice rolls, different types of units, each with their own set of rules, some quirks with priorities and parts of the sort that don't really scream balance, control and elegance. There are lots of minis and 128 rulebooks (maybe a little less). The game pits every against everyone, and players can use their own monsters to attack others, use the heroes and armies of the world to hurt others, while trying to destroy cities (this is the area control part) and keep some monsters hidden in order to protect them from attacks. Decisions mostly involve which monster to make, with whom to attack and what to attack (other monsters, the cities or the armies), which ones to move and to where, when using the armies, what place they will be most effective, and, when to pass - this is the best part of the game for me. Still, the dice rolls, however, can still make or break whatever you decide.

[size=16][b]Rules[/b][/size]
Oh, dear. Explain of the rules took a good chunk of eternity. Considering all the small rules regarding every type of monster, the different actions and their possibilities, the several forms of attack, the diverse way the armies of Earth attack (the hero, the infantry, the mechanized, the jets and the A-Bomb) and how the end game score works, it was almost a miracle that the explanation ended. I kept most of it, but one of my friends, near the end, had forgot what was said early on - but his memory lacks the quality of actually keeping information, so he is no good example, but, since I know there are others like him out there, I think is good the mention.

Once we started playing the game showed itself simpler than we would bet after the explanation. The actions, though there are six different possibilities (but two are really the same), are simple: create/heal, attack, move, use heroes, use armies. And the first two will be the most used. Create allows for the making of monsters, which enter hidden on the board - the amount of create tokens required differ accordingly to the type of monster; it is possible to use these tokens to heal damage taken by monsters, but a regular play will likely be 95% creating and 5% healing. With attack you can hold the token in order for a monster do a bigger attack - for each token the monster add its attack value again, so a monster with attack 2, using two tokens, will roll 4 dice. It is required to take an attack token in order to use others already saved, you can't just attack because you have saved. It is possible to have multiple attack tokens spread in several types of monsters. When attacking you can choose to attack other monsters, neutral units (military and heroes) or the city (but only some monsters can attack cities), and to attack a city, the monster must first destroy all the neutral units defending the city, only excess damage will pass on to the city (and all of it if the city is undefended).

Move is what is says - each monster has a movement value; and these can't be saved. The use heroes is to reveal hidden monsters and to attack the Drakoors (a type of monster that can only be attacked by heroes or other Drakoors), and also activate military that is in the same place. Use military is to attack monsters, usually of someone else, but the rare A-Bomb hit everyone in the city.

Tokens are of limited supply, and in his turn a player takes a single one, uses it or keep it (if possible) than is the next person turn. If the player passes, he put his token in one of the action box - if someone else uses a reghular action in the round, the player that passed can use the action in which he put the personal token as if there was an action token there - this is still considered "passing" for the purpose of ending the round. This is the single best part of the game for me. It is so smart and creates a sensible decision - pass not only might allow you to do an action that was depleted of tokens but also puts pressure on the other players, if even one of them keeps using a normal action token, he will allow everyone that already passed to do an action that isn't possible to anyone that [u][i]hasn't[/i][/u] passed yet! And also is the action that the person mostly want to do, but wasn't able anymore. So, when someone passes, isn't just because he is blocked or out of money, but is an important manouvre that can put you in a better place. Is mostly like passing the become first player in the next round, but probably better as you can do actions [u][i]now[/i][/u], and precisely the one you want. It remind me, in some way, [thing=18602][/thing], as in this one passing is also strong to push the round to an end.

Once everyone passes (and remember that activating actions with the personal token is also passing), the round is over. After a set number of rounds or if all the neutral (brown) rubble pieces are on the board or on damages in monsters, the game is over. Points will be tallied and the player with the most willl win.

So, once the game started, we didn't had much problem with the rules. Still, we reached some parts that, at least for us, weren't totally clear: for instance, it says that the Kiddoo attacks together with other monsters, but can he participate if the attack is against a city? After some readings, we decided that he wouldn't, he would just do his normal attack - but a single line in the rulebook could solve this easily. Anyway, even with some rough edges, the rules were miles clearer than those of [thing=141517][/thing], so Wallace might just had learned to write in the last couple of years, which is awesome for someone at his age.

[size=16][b]Interaction[/b][/size]
Is all over the place. Attacks all the time - you against someone else, someone else against someone else, someone else against you. There is plenty of space for a bashing the leader type of deal. But there isn't much blocking in the game - even with 4, most of the actions will still be there, no matter that you are the last of act in the round. There isn't a way to prevent someone from moving to a place, as there are no limits of monsters in a given city. Is also not possible to thwart a player from creating a monster - players can take create tokens, to make it harder, but there is usually enough to create any monster in two rounds, maybe three if the person isn't in too much of a hurry. 

What is possible is to attack a monster that is saving up attack tokens - these are lost if the monster is killed, so saving up has some danger.

The interaction is "in your face" and there is no way around it. Moongha is an area control, which already usually means plenty of interaction, and in this case, think is like if in [thing=93][/thing] the cards for attack were always available. However, unlike in [thing=127023][/thing], there is ways to score well without actually entering in a war with the others.

[size=16][b]Luck[/b][/size]
There is plenty of it. In a smaller part, it is there in the dice roll at the start of every round, when the dice are rolled to see which actions will gain more activations (either more tokens or more units). This can allow for the first player of the round to have acess to, say, a jet, while the others won't, if there is only one. The difference isn't all that big though, as if the first used a jet (attack 4), surely there will be a tank (attack 3) to be used. The big difference is if luck allows an A-Bomb enters in the game. It deals 8 dice of damage to everything in an area, even the city itself - it is, as expected, a huge thing. And depends on luck to appear and is luck that will give it to one of the players, the one that happens to be the first to play (note: the player isn't obligated to take it, but most likely he will).

But luck will mostly appear in the attack rolls. All the attacks have, per die, a 50% chance of success. So, of course, several people will hit once in every 5 attacks - such are the way things work. And remember that attacks is what the players use to "dominate" areas, not only to bash other monsters e military. To put in perspective think that, to put a cube in Basque Country, in [thing=93][/thing], you would need to roll a die and would have 50% chance of not being able to place it there. Or to corrupt the land, in [thing=43111][/thing], each cultist would have 50% chance of doing it properly. This is bound to cause imbalance, as one can attack a city with 6 dice and put 1 marker and other, with 2 dice put two. Yes, in infinite dice rolls things will even out. Good [i]luck[/i] getting there.

[size=16][b]Components and art[/b][/size]
The art of the monsters is great. The minis are well done, nothing really eye popping once we live in a world with [thing=139976][/thing], still, not going that far, they seem a little bellow the quality of those in [thing=83330][/thing], [thing=104162][/thing] and [thing=42776][/thing], even if by a nudge. I would put it in the league of the ones in [thing=115293][/thing] and [thing=221][/thing].

The board fold well and all is clear enough to see. The spaces on the board are functional, but, with the rubble pieces, sometimes is hard to keep all of them in the proper place while finding room for the minis of the monsters - cubes would indeed work better to mark dominance, but we all know the Kickstarter ways. Tokens are OK.

As in a most Treefrog fashion when handling KS, the game came with two Kiddoo blues and none green. Solvable, I know, but bothersome, specially for those not in UK or US, as not only things take a huge amount of time to arrive, it also might be taxed in customs. I know, this isn't something exclusive of Wallace/Treefrog, and there are much worst offenders out there, however, as my pdf map for [thing=141517][/thing] shows, it isn't a one-of-a-king thing.

Anyway, the bits that come in the huge and very sturdy box are pretty serviceable and look nice on the table. The dice are well done also.

Oh, yes, and there are half of a forest worth of manuals.

[size=16][b]Difficulty[/b][/size]
Lower than I thought at first, specially when considering the daunting ecplanation. There is a good set of choices in every player turn - which action to pick, which monster to create/attack/move/hide/heal, which place to move to, to attack, to flee from. Who is doing well? How can I hurt him? How do I protect myself? Is better to try to dispute a new area or to secure the dominance in other? (There is a limit of 8 rubble pieces in each area, so if you have 5, you are guaranteed to win the city.) How best to defend the cities I have to?

There are lots to think about, and more than once, when it was a player's turn, he would contemplate the board and ponder about what to at that moment. Timming is very importnat, as the limit in rubble might mean that one are you were controlling could be lost and you won't even have a chance to take it back - and there is a harsh tumble from first in an area (4 points) to second (1 point). The Bloobs work well together, allowing for multiple attacks in different areas (or the same), but a single Mechoor resist more damage, is cheaper to make than three Bloobs, but has a more concentrate power.

Still, [thing=64826][/thing] isn't a deep and strategic euro like [thing=18602][/thing] or [thing=120677][/thing], nor is in the same league of depth as a [thing=12333][/thing] or [thing=12493][/thing]. Is a simpler game, more straight foward, and won't take as long to "get it". The learning curve is softer. Moongha is closer in this matter with [thing=115293][/thing], [thing=14105][/thing], around the same spenditure of brain cells as those in [thing=59959][/thing], [thing=66188][/thing], [thing=65532][/thing], and others in this level.

[size=16][b]Time[/b][/size]
The game can last the mentioned low time of 90 minutes, as it can end soon-ish if all the neutral rubble pieces are used. But if the game went on for the full amount of rounds (8 for 4 players, 9 for 3 players) the game will, most likely, stay around the higher end: 120 minutes.

Downtime isn't really a big issue, even with 4 players, as the players do a single action and pass the turn over - the attacks, which are the "slower" part, are decided by a single roll most of the time, and against multiple foes, still would take only a few rolls. The downtime isn't in doing the actions, it can appear in [i]choosing[/i] the action - as I mentioned, sometimes the players just stared at the situation of board and the opponents and entered in a state resembling a coma and it was required that I would throw small objects at the person in order for it to start moving again.

I was expecting a quicker game, by some crazy reason, but Moongha isn't a quick game, so you better slot a 3 hour frame (considering also set up and tear down) to play it.

[size=16][b]Theme[/b][/size]
It is there with a vengeance. It truly reminded me of monster and/or invasion movies. When the jets attack, every 1 rolled, the city takes damage, and this I saw in that terrible [url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120685/?ref_=nv_sr_2]Godzilla[/url] movie. The A-Bomb can obliterate a city - there is a good scene about this in [url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116629/?ref_=nv_sr_2]Independence Day[/url].

There are some quirks that really doesn't make all the sense in the world, like the Heroes only attacking the Drakoors, but they do galvanize the military in the same place to action, or why someone would attack Rio de Janeiro instead of São Paulo, but the scientists are mad, after all.

Since all the monster come from the same planet, it makes sense that all the scientists have acess to the same monsters (though it would be cool if the game allowed for some customization), and why the monsters attack each other is so obvious that you just need to read the news to understand. To make the game easier, all the regions are worth the same amount of points in the end, however, if this wasn't the case, it would also fit the theme better - with all due respect, I can't see the same worth in the Mad Scientists Destruction Club for the one that razed NY as the one that did the same to Rio de Janeiro (as this process already started a good while ago and is going well). But since the game one allow for a limited number of rubble in each city, it makes sense to be the way it is for game purposes - otherwise it would be a race to the biggest point givers and, once they were filled, the others would be an less coveted sister.

[size=16][b]Summary[/b][/size]
[thing=64826][/thing] has several good things about it: is smart, allows for a good amount of strategy (still, as most wargamers know, the planning only lasts until the armies meet in the field - i.e.: until the dice are rolled). The bits are mostly in the good to very good side. Still, I can't find its niche. Around here, with over a thousand games in the group, a game needs to find a niche, to have something that it brings that no other do, or does it better. And I can't find something like this in Moongha.

For area control with fighting, [thing=43111][/thing], [thing=139976][/thing], [thing=72125][/thing], [thing=59294][/thing],  and [thing=127023][/thing] do better, though some will take longer to play, which is a positive in Moongha's side. Considering euros with lots of interaction, [thing=42][/thing], [thing=2651][/thing] and [thing=20551][/thing] do it better. So I just can't see any of us seeing a gap in a game's night that can best be filled by Moongha. Not that a game needs to be unique to be played, sometimes just [u][u][i]not[/i][/u][/u] being a given game is enough to receive a go. Moongha probably won't be asked to the prom, but if it happens to be there, it might, unplanned, just dance with someone.

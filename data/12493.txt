[Vote and comment refer to the standard game, without variants of any sort]
This game gives you everything you need to bring a great space saga on your table, however TI3 also offers a set of rules that in the end don't seem very well rounded, needing that last tweak or two to "click" properly. 
A role selection model is functional if, depending on the situation, each and every role can become your best choice. That doesn't seem to be the case with TI3: having to choose a specific role (Imperial) every round or another specific one (Initiative) whenever the former isn't available is not metagaming, it's an engine that you have to kick every round to make it work properly.
The balance among the strategy cards can also become a matter of debate, even considering the difficulties of trying to put together such a variety of contexts (commerce, political options, technological advancements).
Playing time is too long and that, of course, is not a fault of the game per se, it's me (you have to rule over an entire galaxy, for Pete's sake, what was I thinking?). The objectives usually support the enforcing of your position without leading to open conflict, with a "cold War" feel that doesn't really fit with my idea of space combat. Please, use at least the Age of Empire variant, unless you want to wander pointlessly around the galaxy while you wait to know what can make you win the game.
The command counters system has its own issues: production is coupled with movement, transfer actions are limited to two systems, the fact that command counters need their own economy adds much more problems than the ones they solve, not to mention the strange mix of aspects that they try to put together. I've decided to sell my goods and study some kind of new scientific gizmo, so I can't move my ships. REALLY?
Other minor complaints include the balance of some units and the overall "patchwork" feel of the rules, which of course can be a minor flaw as long as everything works properly, but still makes the learning curve quite steep.
On the other hand, if you're looking for an immersive experience, TI3 it's really up to the task with its (albeit sporadic) space battles, a complex technology tree, a bit of political role-playing, space exploration and almost everything else you could expect. 
Most of all, it's like a space-opera kit that you can use to tailor the game to your tastes, and somewhere in there you could probably find your favourite, mind-blowing, don't-call-us-for-the-next-few-hours space civilization game. The Shattered Empire rulebook is definitely worth a look, because some of its tweaks are easily applicable to the base game even without the extra bits.

The box, the amount of bits and cards, the table you need to keep everything at hand and, of course, the hole in your wallet (made even worse if you consider the expansion): everything about this game seems to be huge. Huge props to FFG's customer service: I got a couple of badly molded units and they took care of the substitution quickly and for free, even if I'm on the other side of the pond. Great overall graphics for a very well implemented theme. 
Good rulebook.

This is the game of all strategy games. It truly doesn't get any better than this! There's politics, technology advances, threats, warfare, back stabbing...everything you could hope for. Its only downside is that it takes six plus hours to play and it is tough to find people willing to sit down for that long to play. Best game ever!

My initial thoughts after one game:

There is a lot to like about TI3. The components are awesome, the scope is enormous, the sheer amount of decisions and options is insane. That being said, after 1.5 hours of rules and 6 hours of gameplay, I didn’t feel like I did much of anything.

I was never able to move more than 2-3 tiles away from my home system. It would take two whole rounds (or three!) to really move your fleet, which is to say, 2-3 hours of game time. I was involved in only a couple battles, during which my entire fleet was wiped out. Except in one case where my wife destroyed another player in a battle, war seemed to cripple both players rather than help the winner advance – meaning it was more trouble than it was worth. 

The downtime also increased exponentially with each hour of the game. At one point near the end I went over 30 minutes without being involved in the game at all. Also, scoring VP is kind of baffling. I don’t think anyone had a realistic Secret Objective they could achieve (all had to do with controlling a laughable number of planets and/or Mecatol Rex) and the ISP was only chosen sporadically, so Public Objectives didn’t really come out until hours 4, 5 and 6.

The sheer length of the game is troubling considering that it takes so long to do anything. I suppose I should have researched it more, but I thought with the high rating on BGG and it being a 6-8 hour game that you would be doing a ton of stuff in an epic space opera. In reality it felt more like Sid Meier's Civilization, the board game, in space (a game I'd be content never to play again). I own and have played Empires of the Void several times, and I feel like I do much more in that game in a total game time of two hours than I ever felt in 6+ hours of TI3.

And yet, despite my misgivings, I have spent a lot of time thinking about the game in the days since. It looks like the expansion and variants like Age of Empires fixes most of the issues I have with it (the snail’s pace at the beginning, limited chances for VP, rewards turtling over warfare). I would try it again, but I would prefer to do so using a variant that fixes some of the base game’s many issues.

The game that made me realise I enjoy reading rulebooks. 

Bombastic space epic with a few tasty Euro influences carefully installed. Quite possibly ruined miniatures combat games for me (not that it took much). Not taken the plunge on my own copy due to the difficulty in finding a group & day for it, but will happily accept an opportunity to play it.

How do you design a game like this?  There are so many moving parts, decks of cards, tiles, bits, choices...

Had a really good, epic time with this game.  I didn't really come super close to winning, but I could see the mistakes I made earlier and how I might have been closer!  An all day affair with 8, yet that is really the only way I could really see playing it.  Had an excellent time, and would love to play it again.  With the JO on Mecatol Rex expansion, I'd raise the rating to a 10.

Very good space empire game. Always willing to play and wanting to get people together to play a game. Sometimes I like to use a few variants to try to shorten game time. This monster of a game takes good planning to get to the table, but it is oh so satisfying...

As a long time fan of Master of Orion II and other civilization games and sci-fi games, the theme for this one is perfect for me. It's my "monster game" of choice.

I like this endgame variant:
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/358579/an-easy-victory-variant-2nd-edition-style-twilig

but I'm thinking about changing benefits to:
stage II: tech cost -1, +1 yield for each trade contract
stage III: tech cost -1, +1 fleet supply limit, free tech
stage IV: tech cost -2, +1 yield from trade contracts

RATING: 3
I would certainly be interested to try it out, but judging by the rules and everything I've read and heard about it, I have my doubts.. Seems fiddly, messy, random and just plain too long. Definitely has tons of cool theme and looks pretty good, though.

---

Tried it, but actually hope I hadn't. It confirmed (or even exceeded) all the doubts I had.

Awful, awful game, borderline broken. Long, tedious, random and boring. Ridiculous components, fiddly and messy gameplay - "do this to do that to get what you actually wanted to do done about three turns (and hours) later.. or maybe not at all." 

It looks like it wants to be coolest game of all time, but actually could not be further from it. I do like civilization and empire building games, but this is not really one, despite appearances.. It's actually hard to say what it in fact is, except utter waste of time and money.

Wow. The word "epic", while descriptive, is an understatement. This game has it all, especially with the expansion. 

Only (nominal) downside: Long playtime... but bearable. Very bearable (for me, anyway... YMMV).

RATING: 9
The most epic boardgame out there. Very competitive and a pure wargame in heart. Very different from eclipse in that respect (eclipse is more about management development economy and planning). It leaves a sense of epicness, and glorious memories, as long as it is played by people who appreciate roleplaying, gaming, complicated rules, and can devote 1-2 hours per player. I advise playing with 4 or more players to feel the galactic senate and competition better. 4 player games preserve the games feel, and can take 4 hours with a trained group, something you could pull even weekly with a dedicated group.

Needs a lot of fudging and house rules to truly shine. I play to 8 with no hidden objectives and take out the boring laws and action cards, there are many of them.

I also use the modules that add more ways for VP like Voice of the Council and the artifacts.

The Daddy. I see no other game coming close to the epic feel of TI3. It's really amazing that a game with such long play times and player turns can always remain engaging and interesting. It's a testament to the design that I never feel bored while playing, even if I'm sitting there for five minutes until my next turn. There's always planning to be done, motivations to be determined, techs to research, tactical movements to be laid out, and devious machinations to undertake. It's always a tense and surprising game that always retains the same epic feel, while remaining unpredictable and different every time.

This is THE heavy epic 4X game. I don't know of another that's as pretty and thick as this baby. And that's it's downfall for me - I can't get a group (but maybe once a year or at a con) to play it. It's akin to going out to a really expensive dinner - you do it once a year or so on special occasions, but it's too rich and thick for regular consumption. Too heavy and long for my gaming group - which is a shame because I think I'd play it more often otherwise.

Played this one many times, love it. Complex and while the games took almost 10 hours with the setup and learning the rules, time flew by while playing. All the players loved it too, hoping to play soon again!

If you like longer games and Master of Orion -like play, get this one!

RATING: 6.5
The basic game falls short of its potential due to 'over-simplified' politics, trade and technology rules and unbalanced 'strategy cards'.

The expansion fixes many of the 'base game' drawbacks whilst adding [unnecessary] 7 & 8 player option.

The wider community have designed numerous rules modifications, the most comprehensive being 'Shattered Ascension V4' [http://ti3wiki.org/forum/YaBB.pl?board=CommunityVariants].

I'm currently looking for a good set of 'Exploration' type rules if anyone has any suggestions/links?

RATING: 6
*Rating based on one play.

TI3 was on my gaming "bucket list", a list of well-regarded or popular games that I want to play at least once.  Now that I've crossed TI3 off that list, I'm not sure that I'll ever return to it.  It's not that I disliked TI3, it's just not a game in my wheelhouse.  TI3 is a long, heavily thematic and interactive game, while I prefer shorter, multiplayer solitaire style Eurogames.

Putting genre biases aside (as much as possible), what did I think of TI3?  I would have to say it is one of the better "dudes on a map" games I have played, head and shoulders above the likes of Risk or Axis and Allies.  I like that you have means of being peaceful in the game (though I think winning is impossible if you don't take the gloves off at some point), and I like that players can interact in non-military ways, through trade and politics.  I like the technology tree system, though I would have liked to see each species have its own tree.  The graphics and bits are all quality, though the graphical design of the rulebook shows its age.

I like that the game's end goal is objective-based, and not simply "eliminate all opponents".  That said, I'm not sure I like how the objectives are handled in the game.  In my one play, I found I was usually able to score an objective the turn after it came up.  I even scored my personal, secret objective fairly early, which may have been a rookie mistake as it painted a big bullseye on my head.  When an objective came up that didn't seem achievable, I was left in a sort of holding pattern, not really having a clear direction to go.  When the next objective that came up was simply a more difficult version of the previous, I again felt directionless.  The galaxy was so crowded at that point that any attempt at territorial gains would result in a swift counterattack and could have left me open to losing much of my empire, so the game devolved into a sort of trench warfare where I was simply trying to maintain my borders and hoping the next objective to come up would be achievable.  It made the last third of the game an uninteresting slog.  Even the other players seemed relieved when the game finally ended after some 8 hours.

In the end, I'm glad to have experienced the game, but I don't know that I'll ever come back to it.  I've rated it a 6 as it is a mechanically solid game with a lot of things to like about it, and if it played in just an hour or two, I'd be willing to play it again.  But as an all-day kind of game, I'm not sure I'd want to come back to it.  It's just not my cup of tea.

We clubbed together to buy this for our group.
It's definitely vastly superior to 2nd Ed in my opinion, and I do enjoy the game more since it became more about diplomacy than piles of cruisers. Managing the counter balance on the player mats is particularly fun, but the game still takes a bit too long to finish for my liking (I'd prefer to play 3/4 shorter games).
*edit* Revised my rating after further plays. The Imperial thing really annoys me since there are a number of action cards that can put you right out of the game from turn 1.
*edit* a member of our group got the expansion, so this may go up in score once we play it

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
If you're committed to the play time, the depth of this game, and realize the potential repercussions of each action on the endgame, the effect is awe inspiring.

Throughout my first play, I kept thinking to myself "wow, there is so much to this game, and it would take a long time to truly master it".  Our group had committed 10 hours to our first play (it only took about 8, with only 6 of actual play time), and by the time it was over, many of us were sad that it had ended so soon!  I think preparation for what we were getting into, really helped with our initial attitude.

The first time you play, it's really long.  There's a lot of explanation and setup involved.  However, were we to play with the same players, that time would probably be cut down dramatically.  I imagine we could get through a game in 6 hours with 8 players.

I CANNOT wait to own this game for myself!

One other thing, it seems the Shattered Empire expansion pretty much bumps the awesomeness rating of this up several notches.  So you may be doing yourself a disservice by playing the game without it.

RATING: 5
Axis & Allies on (a)steroids. When you add a ton of luckbased features to a game where luck is already the main factor, you still end up with the sort of game where luck has more to say than actual strategy. Surprisingly few things happens during the many hours of play and the different options in the game adds only little challenge. For someone who drool over themes like 'starwars' and galaxies far far away this might be the top, but I'm not that someone. To me its an average game, nothing spectacular.

TI is perhaps one of my favorite multi-player games of all time. It is easily one of the best strategy games I have played. While it can be difficult getting up to 6 players to devote the time needed for a game, the payoff is well worth it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Even though the objectives can feel disconcertingly out of place/theme, I am one of those players that can build a narrative out of TI3 and it helps that it has enough flash and chrome to assist in that. I truly feel like I am a space-faring alien race, out to bring glory to my people through combat, diplomacy, and treachery. 

I can certainly see how some gamers may feel there is not enough meat and certainly too much downtime to keep engagement and the narrative flow.

I enjoy both the long term strategic planning and the tactical considerations each turn gives. You always need to be planning one phase ahead to do well.

Marred by a very long play time. Don't play this with easily distracted people or the AP prone because then the ratio* of decisions to time invested gets out of whack. But with the right group of people this can be the epic game you want it to be. 

Another downside is that it can sometimes feel anti-climactic if Imperium Rex (game ends immediately card) comes out to soon. The uncertainty is part of the game though so it is hard to get too upset about it. One needs to prepare.

I find myself thinking about the game after it's over. I think about how my strategy did or did not work, my timing of the various play possibilities, and the other players moves. This is a good sign.

* Thanks to qwertymartin for the "ratio of decisions to time invested" concept.

Overly long and complicated for what it is. The main issue (which looks like it may be fixed in TI4) is that all ships look alike on the board but due to tech etc some are WAY more powerful than others. The game needs iconography or something to show this but everything is on tiny impossible to read cards. So it's hard to weigh up opponents' strength quickly and subtly. Eclipse nails this and is imo a better and more streamlined game. I do like the planet based economy and the diplomacy elements however.

Twilight Imperium. What else is there to say about the greatest board game ever made? There is only one game that I am always willing to play, assuming I have the time, and it is this one.

I grew up around science fiction and, in particular, Star Wars. And Twilight Imperium perfectly captures the kind of sweeping, cosmic narrative that I loved as a kid—no other board game creates stories like this one, with clever diplomacy, trade, bribery and political intrigue, massive battles, and broken alliances.

Technically the base game has a couple of minor flaws, but Shattered Empire neatly resolves them and adds a ton of interesting content. Shards of the Throne is in many ways a weak expansion, but certain modules (Representatives in particular) add even more depth and interesting stories to the game. I play with most of both expansions and wouldn't go back.

EPIC.  If you can put aside the time to play a full TI:3 game and can spare the cash to buy it knowing that you will most likely just play it a few times per year at most (at least with the full 6 players) then definitely do so.  Twilight Imperium is a game like no other; it does warfare and player politics better than any I have ever played.  My first game took about 8.5 hours but felt shorter than my most recent playthrough of Eclipse which was around 2.5 hours.  You just cannot try to take it too seriously because inevitably only one person can win and the game takes pretty much a whole day (at least the first time).  I say TI:3 is like no other war game because the diplomacy/politics actually does something.  If someone goes all out on military and the other players are paying attention then that player is going to get taken back down a peg.  Additionally, the way the victory points are earned, pre-planning is rewarded but it does not favor warfare or peaceful play.  There are far too many concepts and rules to explain in a comment here but if you can GET THIS GAME.  It is incredible.

It is "THE" empire builder game. It has everything you need to conquer the galaxy. If you are able to allocate free hours to play, than you will build explore the galaxy, colonize, build up armies, research technologies to aid you, make diplomatic and arrangements. It is byfar the most complex 4x game available, very immersive and also very huge, as it needs a large table to play on. It can accomodate up to eight players, but that will result in a very prolonged gameplay. It has lots of expansion modules, which you can combine as they suit you, giving more randomness than usual.

It is a Space Opera, not a 4X like Space Empires, it is comparable to Eclipse in theme, but in mechanics it is very different. The playtime is very long, but the game is good enough to justify it. Like ameritrashes in general, there are events that can destroy the strategy of someone a lot, and this happened in the game I played after 7 hours playing and I didn't feel very good about this.

In general I enjoyed this game a lot, very beautiful miniatures, political and trade agreements present, the battle is the main focus, but not the only one. The thecnology tree is very good too, I like this a lot. The theme is great and very well implemented. A fine game but you need to be ready for political events that can be very agressives.

THE big game of galactic conquest. The gaming experience is VERY much dependent on the group you play with. Players who tend to ignore the logic of a game and instead ally with their best mate in order to then start bashing their other opponents can ruin the fun quite a bit. Games can last up to 9 hours but you'll usually know within the first 120 minutes whether you will enjoy the session or not.

3 plays...I now feel no inclinaiton to play the game again, without some significant house rule changes.  However, I do feel a desire to try and fix it, into something that I will find playable.

The rest of my comments relates to the 'unpatched' version of the game. :)  

The role selection system looks like Puerto Rico's, but really, the first guy needs to choose imperial and the second needs initiative to get imperial, or else you just cant get to 10 points faster than the other guys (if you arent doing this, you fall hopelessly behind).
..After that, technology is almost always the best, so really, its just a heirarchy of who gets what for the first several picks.  The only actual 'choice' is at the bottom of the order.
Secondly, fighters seem overpowered, while dreadnaughts seem too expensive for their power.  I'm not sure about that, but it worries me.  It seems absolutely critical to build a fight re fleet, or you jsut CANT fight someoen who has such a fleet.  Sure, what capital ships you add to it might be interesting, but it takes so FRICKING long to get the necessary fighter fleet together, and you have to have it, that the ship types loses a lot of its interest for me.    
Third, the board setup mechanic, I dont know if I like either.  If you dont get any planets in your hand, you can have nothing decent anywhere near you, and be totally screwed.  Also, it seems that the way you set up, its unfair.  Whoever ends up placing last in a ring is getting screwed, especially if people put blanks near them.  Fourth, the game can often stall out in a 'turtling' excercise.  This makes for a boring 6 hours.  I've sat there for 6 hours and had not participated in a single battle all game.  And for everyone, if you fought someone, it meant the others would pounce on your remains very fast, because battles are so mutually destructive if you dont have overwhelming force.  Also, there often doesnt seem to be much at all to gain from winning battles, except maybe for a certain target due to your card or something.  And if you care about conquest, its because your card forces you to care, and then you only actually care about one location probably, either Mecatol Rex or an enemy home.    Late in the game, you get these huge buildups of 20 fighters and some ship on a location, and your opponent has the same, and if you fight you just annihilate each other and others can walk over you.  Why fight?  Most of the VPs come from taking imperial, and things like having 5 techs, having 3 space docks, paying 10 influence or 6 trade goods, have 1 of each color tech, etc, etc.  I can do that from my little corner of the board, with 5-6 planets next to my homeworld, where I build 6 PDS systems and get deep space cannon so I get 6 free shots at you for comign near me, and just turtle there and fulfill all the non-combat victory conditions and take imperial.   By the time you DO want to beat on someone because they will win, or to fulfill your objective, its so suicidal to do so, you just want someone ELSE to do it, so you can go take the remnants of their empire.  The game also takes FOREVER (around 6 hours, from my several experiences), and you dont seem to get any high level tech (except if you're Jol Nar), until it doesnt matter, because the game is already over.  Either that, or you go entirely for only one certain high level tech, and you get it near the end.  You choose one narrow branch of the tree to go through, out of like three brances that are actually any good. 

I really want to like it, but its very difficult.  There isnt a great deal of incentive to attack, and when there is its forced upon you by cards (and the secret objectives seem horribly unbalanced in their difficulty to achieve).  Even then, creating that war with your neighbor is usually suicidal and creates a power vacuum for others near you to rush to take advantage of, as two players fleets are destroyed.  I feel like if I was going to spend 6 hours on a game, it should be Die Macher or something.
Fifth, the action cards are rediculously different in power, ranging from things like gain 1 trade good per planet (~6-8), getting a ground unit per planet, or saying 'no one can take initiative this turn, so I keep the speaker and get imperial 2 turns in a row'.  On the flip side, are cards that barely screw one opponent, or that make your War Suns do a slightly better bombard (who fricking cares?).  They are just so wildly different in power that its a total crapshoot.
Some of the options, especially distant suns, piss me off.  Actually, distant suns pisses me off so badly it makes me want to quit the game after turn 1 when I flip up radiation and lose everything and get 0 planets, and that other guy gets 3-4 planets and a free spacedock and trade goods or a free tech.  Why play the game if after turn 1 you are screwed due to being far behind in the expansion race, and you have to sit there for another 5 hours to see how you lose?  Or everyone slows down to scout, and it adds an hour to the game.  

It really is the case that player 1 must take imperial, player 2 must take initiative, etc.  2 victory points is just such an enormously big part of your score.  There will be a few 1 pointers that come out that are easy, and some guy will get his secret objective for 2, and combined with 2 or 4 from 1-2 takes of imperial, he will win.  If you dont get your 2vps when its your chance, you are just screwed and cant make 10 first, no matter how much you might be killing people militarly.  Not only that, but there is a rediculous advantage to being the first guy to get imperial two times, since then you need only 6 points (6 easy one pointers, or 4 easy ones and an objective).  You just get your second 2 point gain before everyone, and have a tremendous advantage.  Or maybe the second guy to get it.  On the flip side, the guy getting it last is just screwed, as there is no way he gets it twice, and his secret objective merely gets him even with that guy who lucked out and got it twice.  There is just a tremendous disparity between going first (or very early) at the beginning, to going last.  And its because of how broken imperial is (which admittedly, is the 'clock' that makes the game not take  forever).  While its possilbe that a combination of several house rules might fix these various systems (though fixing the turtling problem seems very difficult to me, since there isnt much of any incentive to attack anyway, and you can defend so well with many deep space PDS systems).  So even though it might be fixable, I dont want to have to fix it, and it doesnt seem particularly exciting enough, or give enough cool game for the time investment, to warrant  trying to fix all these mediocre game mechanics.  And thats pretty much how I feel about it, a bunch of mediocre or unexciting or possibly broken game pieces, meshed together to make a very long, 6 hour experience where you sit there and dont get a lot accomplished.  And if you DO go military and manage to do it well without screwing yourself, then some guy has to fricking sit there for HOURS while getting beaten on and having no hope, since he cant possibly win.  I mean, the cool thing about this game is combat.  Late in the game, combat is pretty much suicidal, as even if you overwhelm them and win, you'll lose half your guys and then someone will be able to crush YOU.  If you do it early, when maybe you can catch them unprepared, and it works, then some guys has to suffer through hours of being screwed completely.   Note that my experience was probably more extreme because of playing two four player gmes, where everyone tended to have enough planets.  In the 6 player, some players dont feel that they have enough planets, and are more inclined to attack.  These combats still tend to hurt both players, most of the time, but at least things are more interesting...
It feels like a very average, but long and kindof slow/boring game, clouded in a cool theme, and the hype of its coming out.  
Yet another thing that annoys me about it is that influence is just so woefully underpowered compared to production.  I just dont care about influence, except to have some planet that gives 3 and no money to get an order token every turn.  Most of the laws are really minor, and the ones that do matter, even though you have 12 influence or whatever, if they decide they are screwing you with it because you're ahead or whatever, you cant really do anything about it.  Or you have all the influence and they play Thugs so you cant vote and screw you.  Whereas the industrial capacity is just so critical to doing anything.  If you get influence planets near you instead of industry, you just get screwed and cant do much of anything, and have trouble getting tech, or a big enough fleet to defend, let alone do anything militarily.

Did you ever play Civ 2 on the PC? Well, if you did, you'll remember that one of the weaknesses of an otherwise great game was that near the end of the game, after you ended your turn, you'd have to wait a very long time, sometimes well over a minute, to take your next turn because of how long the computer took to move all of its pieces. Then you would move your one legion or whatever, end your turn, and wait another minute or two while the computer moved. Well, if you want to relive the old times but with pieces you can touch and wait times 30 times as long, here's your game!

First attempt at a three-player game was so-so. I assume the game really comes alive with five or six who know what they are doing. -- Now, I have played the game with six people and seven hours after we started the gameboard is cluttered with hundreds of playing pieces. There have been six minor skirmishes. I have three victory points; two of which I can't score immediately because the rules say so and I'm bored stiff.

Tons of bits, but random set up can make or break a game. If the game was a 20 minute affair, the random set-up would be acceptable. for a four to six, even eight hour game, it is ridiculous. And if you [b]do[/b] have a fair tile distribution, then the game will be longer -- not a very practical affair.

Play time is immense but utterly worth it as this game is as epic in scale as its box suggests.

The gameplay has very solid mechanics, is very strategic and does a fairly good job of avoiding frustrating players who are not doing as well and keeping them in the game, but the six hour play time of this game is just too long.  I gain far more enjoyment from playing four 1.5 hour games than I can from one game of twilight imperium.

RATING: 3
We finally got around to trying this with 5 players. I have to say, at the start of the game and all throughout the 7 hours we played it to 6 points (the rules took an additional 1.5 hours), I was not liking it. I don't like games where there are tons of things to do, but a very limited path to victory points. I dislike it even more when some paths do absolutely nothing to affect points.

My biggest problem with TI is that most actions, and even the most prevalent ones, are not connected with getting victory points. For example, there is a huge military component to the game as most actions, modifiers, and pieces involve battles. However, you don't necessary get any points for following a military route. You can only score points two ways: One through the public objectives, of which all of our had to do with the technology tree. Which meant that capturing planets was only remotely needed to collect resources to purchase technology, except that you could get a technology for free with your strategy card selection (similar to selecting a role before your turn starts). My other issue is that the strategy card selection phase is in clockwise order from the person who selected Initiative from the previous round, which meant that the same players got to pick the attractive cards first. The second way to get points is through a strategy card that gives you 2 points. In our game, the winner got 4 out of 6 points from the sole act of picking this strategy card. Which meant there was little to really do except make sure you get or have enough resources to purchase technology cards (or get the strategy/role card that gets it for free), or make sure you get the freebie 2 VP card - very little benefit to battling others. And finally, the game was way too long for what it was worth and it took 4+ hours to get to our first battle.

Twilight Imperium 3rd is possibly one of the greatest games. Certainly one of the grandest strategy games. With the exception of a few flukes, it feels very balanced and epic on a galactic scale. If you get the opporunity to play this more than once or twice a year, you should consider it a great privilege. The only negative thing about this game is the reluctance most people have to trying such a new heavyweight game.

Update 2016: After many many action card/political deck changes and a few tweaks to weaker race abilities, I can say that Twilight Imperium easily meets a 10 on BGG. Truly its biggest setback is that the fat is not trimmed from the cards and some races are a bit underpowered. That having been said, we now give new players L1X1X/Saar/Hacan/Sol and veterans take a handicap with Xxcha and some expansion races, so they have a practical use at least. With every expansion added, there can definitely be some slowdown and large galaxy maps are actually not desirable. I can see this being a game that I continue to refine for years to come.

This is a fantastic game, that truly makes you feel part of an extremely captivating space saga and of an engaging 4X experience. In addition to the core mechanics, several optional rules and an extensive lore give this game lots of depth and variety.

Epic.  It's hard to imagine a better game to play over the course of 8 hours.  It's got combat, economics, politics/negotiation, exploration, and asymmetrical player powers.  The internets claim the base version is broken because of a dominant strategy, but that's easily fixed by tweaking the Imperial card a little bit to depower it (although this produces a longer game) or instituting minor house rules to curtail selection of the Imperial card.  Love it.

I would probably rate TI3 higher than a 7, but I haven't had a game yet to convince me to do it. I've only played one learning game, and it had some issues.

I played with expansions and some idiosyncratic variants which started me off confused. I read the base game rulebook and was surprised how streamlined the information in it was. Turns out, adding in expansions and variants turns everything on its head. I was definitely lost for a bit. The base mechanics I was interested in were still there, but a bit muddied and different. 

Plus, we played with a pre-made map (boo!). I was really looking forward to building the galaxy. It's the only early game sense of exploration and agency available. Although we did play with domains, I forgot the rule (and it was never mentioned in game) about scanning domains before exploring! Still, I wanted some control over my galaxy.

The game itself has incredibly arcane, weird pacing IMO. Maybe experience might change things? But since we had no idea what kind of public goals would come up, I spent the first half of the game sort of bumbling around hoping to stumble into a position that would set me up to achieve goals once they actually appeared. I was not playing a particularly warlike race, so jumping into direct fights for control of places that the very warlike races *were* controlling looked like a dumb move. So, ho hum, the first half was pretty meh.

The second half was more interesting. But that's when the mountain of variants and unexpected rules started getting in the way--once we actually started trying to do things. Again, it was a first play, so what are you gonna do.

Another gameplay criticism has to do with the thematic options available. There's a claim made that TI3 is an empire building game. Honestly, I'm still trying to find a good empire building game. There's no real building of the empire at all. It's a strategic wrestling match hoping you can snag some goals and not have your fragile little foothold blow up. TI3 is not empire building, it's the frontlines of a murky war with a fairly heavy degree of luck filled battle mechanics and random objectives that pop up to snag points.

Honestly, the objective based dicey combat reminds me more of Nexus Ops than anything else. TI3 is like a blown up, epic space battle version of Nexus Ops with politics, activation markers, strategy cards, etc. I'm not saying that's bad, but it's not what I was looking for. I want a little more agency in building and managing my empire PLUS the frontlines of a space war. If we're gonna build a game this big, why can't we have that? Sigh. 

On a side note, I actually think that Nexus Ops's all secret goal system works better than TI3's primarily public goal system. AND Ops lets you get (less) points just for winning battles even though fulfilling goals is way better. I'm not saying TI3 should do that. But a couple more ways to score points inefficiently to give you SOME early game direction without feeling like you're completely wasting your time would be nice.

Finally, I found the narrative of TI3 pretty weak. For a thematic game, it just didn't feel all that thematic too me. Maybe it takes players more invested in their races, but the races are a little eh for me. I'm not particularly interested in pretending to be any of them. There wasn't anything about the gameplay that really "put me there" or told me the story about drastically different races vying for power. More like drastically similar races with minor strengths and weaknesses saber rattling and dancing around each other, am I right?

Revised down from a 4. After 4 plays, I NEVER want to play this again. Interminably long, with only a handful of interesting decisions (at best), you could spend the entire day playing a dozen other great games and STILL finish before this behemoth wraps up.

Fantastic game, well worthy of being one of FFG's flagships, though not without its flaws (many of which are fixed with the first expansion).  It's not a space wargame - there's not often full-on combat, it's more of a diplomatic space opera simulator where you sometimes need friendship and sometimes need to beat people over the head with the War Sun stick.  The goal of the game is to get points, so Imperial I is right out - we like using the Shattered Empire: Bureaucracy strategy card path.

The main issue other than Imperial I is that it's got a bunch of economic objectives, which can make it really turtle-y.  The more combat-oriented objectives in Shattered Empire make things much nicer.

I love TI and how deep and fleshed out the game is. Of course, this assumes that you have both expansions. The base game without the expansions is actually pretty unfair (Imperial much?). For a long, epic, space opera game, I love how deep the political mechanics are, and that you are almost always involved in some action even in between your turn (secondary strategy actions). There are some Secret objectives that make the game focus too much on military might and making someone miserable, but house rules can mitigate that. Overall, one of my favorite games that I don't get to play nearly enough.

Played once with elements of the Shattered Empire expansion.  Came to it with some foreboding as monster FFG games have a very poor track record with me and Twilight Imperium set the template for them.  

As so often with FFG, the bloated rulebook belies a game that is actually quite straightforward.  There is role selection a la Puerto Rico, complete with the opportunity for other players to use that role to a lesser effect.  The command chits that must be spent to do anything are quite cleverly implemented.  Technological development is present and handled unfussily.  Combat is of the bucket of dice variety, with retreats handled in a decidedly odd manner. The board assembled from hexagonal tiles, the different races, random objectives and tons of action and political cards offer a lot of variability.  Unfortunately, some of that takes a very cavalier attitude to game balance.  

In our game the pace seemed off.  The early hours were an arms race with little actual fighting.  We felt that better use could have been made of objective cards to promote more aggressive play from the start.  Just as the stalemate seemed to be broken and the game was getting interesting, the game over card was drawn, leaving everyone dissatisfied.   

Eight hours passed fairly quickly; TI kept me busy and reasonably entertained.  And yet, rather like Arkham Horror, I was left with the impression of a lot of chrome concealing not a great deal under the bonnet. In nothing but the time it took did TI feel epic. Nor did it present me with the kind of strategic dilemmas I expect of a truly big game.

Production quality and artwork are as good as you would expect from FFG.  The too obvious borrowings from Star Trek, Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica were something of a disappointment.

The L1Z1X sent messages in binary, like this translated epistle to the Xxcha ninja turtles: "Rafael was my favorite of your 'leaders' BTW." 

Playing an eight-player game of TI was one of the most fun days ever.  And I mean DAY.  Eight hours of fun.  All encompassing dice-throwing goodness.  The superlatives just sound like blah, blah, blah after a while, but man...

RATING: 6.5
Where to start? This game should be my jam. I love space, I love 4x, I love epic. Let's break this down into positives/negatives.

So here's the positives for me: I love the activation system, I love the strategy cards, I love the idea of galactic politics (wish Eclipse had that!). Combat is okay. I really like that the activation system forces you to think about how you would like to go about attacking, because you can't build and then attack the same turn (without a strat card). 

On the negative side, three major flaws for me: Politics is such a cool idea... but we never really drew anything super interesting from the politics cards. Maybe we just got unlucky. Also (and this might be due to the strat cards we used), the slow slow burn/reveal of public objectives (and no 2pt imperial strat card) meant it felt like on some turns I had no idea what to move towards for points, so I was just stalling for a completeable objective. And the final, killer flaw for me: play time. Seven hours for our first game. The Puerto Rico turn mechanic can make some turns (as you wait for reaction follows) go forever, and if you have a big battle that you're not in, its just nap time. 

All that said, I would play again. This game/theme is still right in my zone, but it won't unseat Eclipse for me. I find myself wishing Eclipse would steal a couple mechanics - politics and strat cards.

RATING: 7.5
Best game our group has played in a while. Very enjoyable, though VP bonus for the Imperial strategy card is too much and unbalalnces the game of makes the card choice a bit too predictable as it just goes round each player in turn. Expansions rectify this and give a lot more options to make the game varied.

Subsequent plays has seen this drop as interest wanes. Lots of variants but our group mainly goes for combat options. Also seems to take a long time.

A monster of a game. If you've played either Sid Meir's Civilization or Alpha Centauri and thought it'd make a good  board game then this is for you. It takes elements for Axis & Allies and then adds a euro-layer to the game but adding political and non-military aspects to it through a mechanic lifted from Puerto Rico. A four hour game best with 5 or 6 people, it delivers, but its not for everyone.

This game if much improved by the expansion if only for the Imperial Strategy II card.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I have decided.  This game provided interaction, intrigue, commerce and fun.  It is the epic of epic. This one beats out Eclipse

Expansions:
Shards of the Throne
Shattered Empire

I think this game is great, still has many flaws that I don't like, I guess that is why I kept eclipse instead of this one, but it is a great game, I just wish they came out with a TI4 so that they would fix all the crap that is wrong, streamline some of the game play, enhance the politics and trade and make everything balance.  In the end, both expansions are necessary because they help balance an unbalanced game, I enjoyed it, and if they come out with a new version, will probably buy it, but only if they fix a lot, and improve on the board hexes quality, mini quality and a lot more things that would make it better.

What a fantastic game with an epic scope.  The myriad of choices, the modular and semi-random board, the countless ways that this game would develop and play differently each game is amazing.  I loved the first game I've played and I can only wait with impatience for my opportunity to play again.  TI makes me interested in other "monster" games and expands my horizions as to how quality can come in quantity. (time that is)

We were with very good player this weekend to play TI3. Honestly not my favorite game. Some things doesn't work for me like the politic and trade cards. These aspects are not fully exploited, and they just increase the general luck of the game. The main focus of the game is the war. Personnaly, I would have like to have a way to win the game either by political or economical reason. On this game, we were killing each other wihtout a reason why. 4 turns before the end, I stop expending, stop fighting and retreat myself on my homeworld. I knew how much point I could get and when I was schedule to win, and that was not matter what the others would have tried on me. The plastic pieces are awsome and the battle resolution work, but the fighter and ground troops are overrated.

Have a good game.

the more i play this the more i like it.  the turns can be quite quick with nearly no down time (the action round system works well).  this is not just a war game as there seem many ways of scoring  victory points. the theme on this is thick and juicy too.  i'll want to play this when ever i have time and good opponents.

the imperial card is of concern, but only if players dawdle and do not aggressively chase their secret objective...  if players do not play like this, the player who went 1st should win (probably).

TI3 has several phenomenal characteristics as a game. It massive and elegant, allowing for incredible player interaction. 

The issue with the massiveness of the game is it doesn't allow players to become "good" at it. Developing a strategy around the technologies, cards, and conflict would be great if this game could easily be played 10 times, but it can't. Furthermore, the combat is atrocious and can swing games way too much.

Very good game overall and makes other strategy games seem simple and feeble. However, I did find the games all took a long time, which may put some players off. I also found that the winner could easily be seen within the first few rounds, which did cause a slight lack of engagement midway (unlike European-style games, in which many victories aren't so easily predictable). Would still play again and would recommend to anyone else

It has all you could expect from a Space Conquest game and much more: warfare, technology, diplomacy, the Imperial Senate,... Awesome game. The flow of the game, with the activation system is very good, with almost no downtime. Yes it's long, but a game with this scope can't be any shorter and not loose punch. Yes it's complex (but not so much, since the rules are very consistent and easy to remember), but the game is really, really worth it. Unfortunately FFG seems unable to get a game completely right, even if it's in its 3rd incarnation. Out of the box the Imperial Strategy Card is terrible, fighters are too powerful and politics is too bland. You'll need house rules and/or the expansion to get the perfect 10 game Twilight Imperium can be.

Not as intimidating as I thought it would be. I was worried a lot about the long play time but I don't think the play time would be too bad if not teaching any new poeple.

Good strategic space game.  Once people built up to a certain point, the game was at a balance where whoever made the next attack would be at a disadvantage (since we'd all counter-attack).  Seemed to be very difficult to conduct a proper offensive.  However, this doesn't make for a bad game, it just means you have to make a plan and stick to it.  The technology system and political system are very nicely put into the system.  Combat is also very simple.  And the variety of races make for some good replayability.

Everything you could possibly want in an empire building game. Politics, War, Technology, Diplomacy, and Trade to name a few. All put together with a fluid system and amazing production values.

The expansion takes this to another level, and just piles on more. If you like Twilight Imperium you need the expansion, it's a galactical space opera of the grandest scale in your living room, this is the epic game you are looking for!

The variety of races and the combination of strategic wargame is very well done.  Worth investing an afternoon in playing.  [GTI Code: TGSD]

It frankly boggles the mind just how ambitious and huge this game is...not only in game length but scope. The ultimate space opera struggle, with well conceived, well balanced races, tons of components, and a great balance of luck and determination, the former brought through dice and random card draws, the latter through how you manage your control tokens and what strategies you'll pick as primary or secondary. Battles are relatively fast once you get the units squared away, and I doubt I'd want to play this without the Leader and Domain options, since those flesh out a more adventurous setting. Problem will always be how to set aside time and find people interested in learning to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Tentative rating based upon 1.5 plays.  There's a long learning curve on this one before you learn to optimize or even play well all the different races.  I like the economic and technology tree aspects of the game, but they can become a larger part of the game than control of the board.  This game plays radically different based on number of players due to some of strategies not being chosen each round with a fewer number of players which can handicap races needing technology, trade or other things.  With my group there's a real tendency to turtle, which makes the game less than it could be.

I swear that my friends conspire to get together and play this behind my back and then tell me about it later.

Tried the quick start and for those on a time budget that's the way to go.  This is a game that is all about the journey, not the destination.  However, over time I'm finding myself less and less willing to play this because of the length of time that it takes to play.  The introduction of Eclipse also caused this game to slip in the rankings.

I believe that this plays best with 6.

The biggest problem with the game is that the deadtime will increase towards the end as fleets and income increase and it will really start to drag.

My score on this game presumes play with the Shattered Empire expansion.  This used to be rated a 10, and I considered it to be my favorite game.  The reason it has slid back pretty much has to do with the amount of time necessary to complete it.  No less than 3 hours for a 3-player game (much, much longer for the recommended 6 players) and 30-45 minutes just to set it up and break it down.

All that having been said, I still love the game.

This is probably my favorite game. Granted, I only played it once (I want to... no, I need to play it again). Magnificent game. Sure it may take a while to play, but that was nothing compared to when Arkham Horror goes mental on you:
-Woohoo, I'm not delayed anymore. I'll just move over here and try an encounter.
*they see me rolliiiiiing - dice!*
-Guess what? 
-What? 
-Now your lost in time and space!
o_o ... 
- Khaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan!

TI3 gives you a lot of control and free reign to play as you want, and you feel like everything you do matters (because it does!). My only gripe with the game is the Strategy card that gives you 2VP... In a 4-player game we had a player that managed to snatch it 3 times in a row (he ended up winning the game because of it) but it is fixed in one of the expansions, so will get them at some point... Already hoping for a 3rd expansion. :)

Update 22.February 2015: Played the game for the second time, made a house rule so that the "Imperial"-strategy card only gave 1 point when it was chosen. It is a bit closer to the Imperial II version (which I don't have as I currently don't own the expansions). This made the game much more enjoyable and a much closer run to the finish.

I can without a doubt say that this is my favorite game ever. :)

While the game has a steep learning curve and fairly long play time the game is quite dynamic and social. (I do not recommend playing this with people you don't like)  The game is best played with 5  people and the rules are such that only slow players will cause games to go much over 4 hrs.  When I have had 5 of my friends playing this game we could usually complete it in right around 4 hrs (not including the fair amount of set up and cleanup)  Game is even better with the Expantion

Not much to be said about TI that hasn't already been said. Personally, I prefer the core game with the old Imperial card. All optional rules in effect. The game flows well, and though it takes a while, it's a strategy game with tons of saber-rattling, so it scores high in my book.

------------

After my third game of TI, I have to adjust the marker a little bit. While this is still a great game, I'm dropping it to a 7 simply because I wouldn't want it to hit the table every week.

Our last game was amazing, but ended when the Imperial order got messed with (someone played an action card to prevent Imperial from being drawn, then someone else countered with an action allowing them to switch their strategy with Imperial, which in turn would allow him to draw it twice in rapid succession - as such, the game came down to an action card lucky play... and I don't prefer those) that aside, it was still a GREAT game... just not an event that I'm looking to recreate week after week (maybe once every 6 months or so).

RATING: 10
After two (almost) full games it's finally time to make a judgement on the game... And it's a winner, with the caveat that you must have Shattered Empire to make it work properly. The game is heavy war game epic, with depth in every aspect, barring economy. Comparisons with the heavily euro Eclipse don't quite fit; this is a war game with heavy diplomacy. The game is won and lost in posturing and manuevering. Eclipse follows the same theme and plays much quicker, but without the weight of TI and with its clockwork euro design, feels like a very different beast, one of efficiencies and cleverness. 
Where TI finds better company is in games like Game of Thrones and Diplomacy - broad strategic play whilst balancing threats and relationships. This is something that comes to fullness with an investment of time - something that is consciously trimmed from other, more euro civ-builders.
The game has flaws- in true Fantasy Flight style, the rule book(s) are a mess - why a game this big didn't get the GMT style treatment is a mystery. Also, randomness has a lot to say. However, there is a broad decision space to mitigate this, and if that fails, one can try to talk out of trouble. By its nature, this will only get sporadic play, but it deserves more. An epic experience and a genuinely great game.

Va a ser el único juego que comente sin haberlo jugado.. Siempre valoro cuándo sé de que va... eso en mi caso ocurre en la tercera o cuarta partida. Sin embargo creo que tardaré muchísimo en jugarlo así que después de releer las reglas, reviws y demás zarandajas,decenas de veces, creo que sé de qué va el juego. Para mí perfecto. Ameritrash con ciertas mecánicas eurogames. Todo excelenetemente integrado... Yo no le pido más a un juego. 

Pegas: pide 6 jugadores (aunque a 4 y 5 parece ser que fona también bien). Y su duración es bastante larga. Al que le gusten estipo de juegos, como a mí, no es un problema (al contrario)... yo disfrutaré desde el principio hasta el final. Lo malo es, en mi caso, convencer a gente que no está mnetida en  este mundillo a encerrarse 6-8 horitas de juego, + 1-2 de explicación... misión imposible.

Edito a 14-IV-2012: Ya jugado, a tres jugadores para pillar mecánicas y reglas. Juegazo PERO creo que puede tener mucho tiempo de espera entre que juegas y te vuelve a tocar... Para mí quizás demasiado. Ya veremos. De momento me pongo la venda antes del palo.

Edito a 16-IX-2012: Pruebo el Eclipse y me deja unas sensaciones maravillosas. Y de Downtime nada de nada. Así que llevo dándole vueltas a mi valoración al TI3 y le voy a bajar mi nota de diez a nueve y medio. En realidad me muero de ganas por jugar a los dos, pero creo que el tiempo de espera y la duración, con lo que soy yo, me van a dejar un regustillo amargo.

Big! Bloody big and takes forever to play. Great game. Maybe Twilight Imperium IV will be Imperium Lite. In truth, if I were not a sucker for lots of little models I probably wouldn't have this as it can be difficult to arrange the time for a group of players to really become immersed in this game. Nonetheless, game play, rules and design of the game are top-class - this is no second-rate game trying to peddle itself on the back of lots of bling miniatures, but a properly resolved and well thoughtout game.

Pár nappal a játék előtt figyelmeztettek rá, hogy van egy túl egyértelmű stratégia a játékban (felváltva kell választani az 1. és a 8. stratégiakártyát). Ez a hiba ki lett küszöbölve állítólag, de nem volt időm utánaolvasni, szóval az eredeti szabályok szerint játszottuk.
Valóban túl egyértelmű, hogy ez a helyes kombináció, tehát a kezdőjátékos túl nagy előnyt kap. De nem csak ez a gondom. Mindannyiunk számára unalmassá vált pár kör után a tötyörgés, sok holtidő, a pontozón alig haladtunk előre. Zavaró, hogy lényegében egyedül célkártyákból szerezhető győzelmi pont (leszámítva a már említett 8. stratégiakártyát). 1 kör kb. 1 óra alatt ment le nekünk, és minden körben 1 vagy 2 pontot szerzett mindenki... És nem nagyon volt tétje 1-1 csatának: inkább csak úgy általában fejlődni kell mindenből, és reménykedni, hogy olyan célkártya jöjjön, amit teljesíteni tudunk. De kicsit céltalan az egész, talán egyedül a titkos célkártya jelent valami kiszámítható célt, de abból meg nem húzható új.
Alapvetően biztató volt a szabály, jó a hangulata a játéknak, és rengeteg ötletes elem van benne, (pl.a parancsjelzők elosztása nagyon tetszik, a szavazások is, stb.), és a 400+ kártya, 10 jól kidolgozott faj sok újrajátszhatóságot sejtetett, de így játszva mégse kaptam kedvet hozzá. Összefoglalva: kicsit többet vártam egy ilyen fajsúlyos játéktól, a nagy ki-bepakolás, sok alkatrész, másfél-két óra szabály, jópár óra játékidő nem áll arányban a játékélménnyel. De sok biztató rész is volt, ezért még kell neki adni esélyt mindenképp! Simán mehet még felfelé a pontszám.
(Még egy megjegyzés: nemrég próbáltam az Eclipset, ami szintén nem egy hibátlan játék, de sokkal inkább Euro, sokkal változatosabb, és egzaktabb mint ez, ezért az nekem jobban tetszik.)

Long to say the least and quite overflowing with stuff if you are playing for the first time. Apparently some balance issues that the expansions (if I understood correctly) are supposed to correct.

Damn this game promises so much but is so insanely and unecessarily complicated it becomes an ordeal to organise and play it. Complex computer games should not be turned into board games.

And I have won this twice in a row, so i CAN play it. Would easily play more if only there was the time!

Sam Healy's non-stop raving on thedicetower got me into this epic game. It is a classic in my books and in my opinion every sci-fi loving geek should own a copy of this game.

Very nice thematically,it reminds me of the computer game Masters of Orion II.The graphic design of this game is its basic flaw.I needed more illustrations but mainly I needed rule remiders.Particularly the technologies needed some illustrations and should be better depicted in a player aid,and their possible effects on each player mat.Some of the laws are devastating.I expected mainly a space civ development game.However it does make a very thematic space battles game.And the different units are perfectly minimal designed to be intuitive and less confusing than other similar games.

Initial Impression: A very thematic, epic game. The components are typical FFG awesomeness. The race to achieve a set goal of VPs is what gives this game its tempo. Winning is mainly achieved through conquest, aided by politics and technology. Each faction's asymmetrical powers seem well balanced. The experience of playing this game is well worth the time investment. I'm looking forward to playing it again, now that I have a better understanding of what I'm doing.

RATING: 4
Played once as a 6-player game with a ton of optional rules and also with the Shattered Empire expansion.  TI3  probably appeals more to gamers who enjoy making/breaking alliances with neighboring players.  The unfortunate thing is that you spend most of the game buying/stockpiling units on your initial homeworld and 2-4 neighboring hexes.  You then make an alliance with the neighbor on your right and play a game of chicken with the neighbor on your left.  If and when, you end up attacking each other, it's usually with 1/4th of your total units engaged in a battle over 1 hex.

In order for TI3 to really work, I feel that every player should know the rules at the geekiest level OR each and every player should have awesome player aids to reference.  In addition to this, players need to play at a decent pace and there should be an "active player" button that passes around.  To give you an idea of just how slow the game was moving, we completed Round 4 at the six hour mark.

I just participated in a full game of TI3 and rate this a solid 8.  The only items holding it back from a higher rating are the length of time needed to play.  The logistics required to bring this one together are extremely difficult.  The game itself is a fun space epic with plenty of action to keep players involved.  The politics at the table are fun and the fact that warfare is not necessary is cool.  The winner of our most recent game was never involved in any space battles!

The Imperial Strategy Card is not the problem. The problem is the length of the game (we played 7+ hours with 6 players) compared to the amount of luck in the game. Makes no fun to loose after 7 hours just because of bad draws (cards and tiles), bad die rolls and neighbors playing strangely...
Besides, this is a BIG game in every aspect. Once in the year you will pull this out just to enjoy the large scale (component-wise and gameplay-wise) of it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I am impressed by the quality of the components and as a fan of science fiction, I love the theme. Combat is satisfying, and allows for some variety of ships and technologies, along with racial abilities. My concern is with the amount of strategy available in achieving victory conditions. Of course based on one 12 hour (!) 4 player session, it too early to tell. Hopefully we can cut play time to a more manageable 8 hour session, with two 4 hours periods and lunch in between!

Update: Unless playing with all experienced players this is most definitely an 8-10 hour game. I find myself liking it less because it has too many pieces which do not necessarily add depth, takes too long, and has more diplomacy than I prefer. FFG seems to specialize in games of this nature but I only enjoy War of the Ring.

UPDATE - [1.14.18] FOR TRADE or SALE ($75.00 w/ Shattered Emipres Exp.)

I have an extra copy of the TI3 w/ the Shattered Empires Expansion.  Willing to trade or sell 2nd copy.

[5.1.17] I had a chance to play a partial game of TI3 with a group of 7 people, and it has laid to rest the (now older) debate between which is better TI3 or Eclipse.  

These games are at best superficially the same (space theme, elements of exploration, inclusion of tech trees, etc.), but at their core these are fundamentally different games.  

Everything about Eclipse is smooth and sleek and at its core the game centers around the efficient manipulation of your economy to do different actions (explore, build, research, etc.)

Conversely, TI3 is textured, and the game itself does not reward efficiency of manipulating game mechanics alone.  Yes, at its core, TI3 uses a Puerto Rico-esque role selection mechanic where the primary player is able to enact a slightly more powerful version of a secondary action that is offered, at a cost, to all other players.  Beyond this mechanic, however, is a modular board that bring tactics into the game that echoes that which is seen in the Milton Bradley Gamers Series titles such as Axis & Allies, Shogun, etc.  Also built into the game is a high degree of politicking, bluffing, and fragile alliance building/breaking. 

The game is wrought with twists and turns and at the end of the session you and your friends will have a story to tell.

I think this game can be best described as a game that is driven by euro mechanics, skinned by ameritrash swag, that results in a narrative to be remembered.  

It is well worth the investment of time to play.

[2.8.12]
Reading rules... Can't wait to play.  This game looks like it has a high amount of interaction both with combat and just person to person politics and diplomacy.  It is long, looks messy, crap all over the table, modular board - pure Ameritrash!

In my early teens I was a great fan of the first Civilization PC game (and later Masters of Orion). At the same age I made the first contact with Boardgames - Risk. 

When I played Risk the first time I really appreciated it, since it was a boardgame, which resembled the conquest aspect of Civilization - but of course I wanted the other aspects of Civilization as well. One could say that since then I always searched for a boardgame that succeeded in that - bringing all the aspects of Civilization or Masters of Orion to the table. I thought that this combination would generate the perfect boardgame. 

On my way I found out that a perfect boardgame doesn't need to have all this aspects and that too many mechanism can easily kill the game as a whole. Even though my favorites aren't al all like Civ or Moo I must say that TI really achieves to combine all the essential aspects of Civ or Moo and to be a great game as well.

Update: Literally after each session, I have the feeling that the gamesystem is suboptimal. The epic "build up and bash" of a good conqeust game is missing; instead of tension and narration you get a random VP hunt. Either this is state of the art turtling (since there are a few games in which a war between A and B benefits C more) or attacking has nothing to do with waging a war but is only a gamey move to earn VPs (if you use the expansion's Vp conditions). It starts to feel like the longest Eurogame in history.

The still somewhat joyful game is downgraded to a 7

Played 2 turns of a game to get a feel for it, and then played a full game. With a break for dinner, this took us from 2pm until midnight, with 6 players who had never played before.

I had a great time. There is a lot of luck, and some of your choices are dictated by your race/action cards, but this is a great game. Player elimination could happen, but it is sufficiently rare that I can't see it happening more than once in 100 games.

My rating is a little off if you go strictly by what BGG defines them as, simply because I don't frequently have this much time to devote to one game. When I do though, this game will be the choice.

3-player.
Very slow start on rules explanation/setup (we were all new to game, except 1 player having experienced TI-2).
8:30-11:30 for that first part.
11:30-4:15am for gameplay.
Managed 5 turns before needing to be elsewhere. I was likely third. Good experience, however. Yeah, it's everything all the fans crow about. I'm now a crow. On an incomplete TI3 diet. WANT MORE . . .!!!

2012-12-15 - Finally!! 3-player game, starting from scratch, using sample of options from all three parts. Rules discussion started at 9:30am - didn't finish until 12:30pm (we're detailed like that). Then time for setup - that took us until 2:30pm (had to have lunch in there somewhere!!). By then one of us had to leave, but as planned, the pinch-hitter arrived just in time for game start.  We got through 2 rounds by 7:30pm. My favorite part - the political intrigue component from Shards - that provided the richest experience. We didn't even get to mercenaries, wormholes, factories/etc. and a bunch of other options. That's okay. 2/3 enjoyed it (yay for Ameritrash!) - the third didn't like the random/luck factor (oh, bah humbug to you!). 
Love this game. Hope to train up other core players so that we reach that nirvana state of the experienced 6 player all day blowout. Sigh ... I can wish, can't I?

My first game was spent just getting my head around the rules and some basic strategies. Game two I was still rusty but at least picked up from where I left off and despite making some shocking mistakes at least had an idea of what was going on. Deeply strategic and with wide possibilities that make nothing a foregone conclusion. Scales down well to 3 players.

As time has passed the long play time and heavy dice engine has resulted in this never getting on the table. It is unlikley to make it back so time to trade on.

Jan 2012: Indeed this one is too huge and takes too long to reteach to new comers. Along with its 4-5 hour playing time, this is a day long game and with the randomness and pivotal role of the dice in combat, I really would much rather play almost any other game in my collection. Down rated to a 7 and sold on.

Just epic in its scope, which I adore on so many levels. I really enjoy how each race feels COMPLETELY different with their special abilities. These abilities should really dictate your strategy as you play. I also enjoy the combat. Normally not a fan of buckets o' dice combat, but here it works. Why? Because of the cards that can be played to really help you or mess up your opponent. I don't feel that the Imperial card is a game breaker, but actually acts as a timer for a game that will go at least 4-5 hours anyways. My only gripe would be the hexes for the galaxy. I am not a big fan of the garish color scheme, but hey that's just me. This one will never leave the collection. Also, did I mention....... WAR SUN!!!!!!!

I have dreaded adding this note to my one and only play for sometime, because it was one of the most horrendous plays I have ever personally experienced. I was the ONLY one at the table with any experience with the rulebook, and it was my game and my first play! suffice to say that my reading and understanding of the rules had taken place MONTHS before we sat down, and no I had not revisited them. Also bear in mind that a copy of a game was in the house that we are all more familiar with, even though it was new and never played as well in the person of Starship Catan. Which was my vote to play, but since it had been months since I had obtained TI, my well meaning "group" My Wife, one of my very best friends and his wife, decided it was High time I got to play my last years Christmas Gift. seeing as how I had kinda planned to play Starfarers, I had not so much as glanced at my TI rules in MONTHS, so as you know, It was brutal, I got questions before I answered their last questions, and it went on and on and on. The fault is mine as the game was unpunched, and we had four players, and I also let it go on wayy too long, I should have called the session, before the dropouts started, that was my bad. 


But I did it because in between the questions and confusion, my buddy and I both got it, and we both lit up like six year olds every time something new happened...and that is when it hit me, again actually: This masterpiece is like the most tasty meal that once you get up from it you have at once had both all your favorite courses and desserts, yet are not stuffed, just supremely satisfied. The first time I had this feeling was after my third read and research through the rules that first time months before, when I KNEW this game and could have answered all questions. Needless to say the ladies are not too fond based on that one play, even though they promised to give it another shot. Even in all this adversity, the game showed me a glimpse of itself, and I await my "second" gaming group; made up of that same buddy and several others who all love this sort of thing, getting together around this one with HOURS to kill, and THAT alone has the score where it is for me, this is one of my Favorite games currently and of all time. Continual brushing up on the rules just keeps me more and more excited to play it, and overjoyed that I own it!

05/08/10
There is another play in there, partial though it is, with no real hangups, and not totally finished, it does not raise my score any, but it got close! it was basically a learning game, for me, to get me back on my feet after the brutality of the first one. This game will be played by myself and anyone I can corral into the seats opposite me for a long time. I won't add the play here, nor any other until I have a full table again, I am expecting to raise this score however, very soon indeed.

Interesting riff on the naval warfare mechanics in Axis and Allies.  Kinda fun, but really LONG.  The balancing for the different sides seems pretty good, with some particularly better than others at certain victory conditions.

If you are in the mood for an epic space battle spanning a good portion of your day, this is the game you should grab. In my opinion, a significant improvement over earlier versions with a well defined turn sequence. My rating would be higher if the game encouraged more actual combat. Of course, my rating would be lower if it weren't for the high quality components.

Update: Picked up and played with the expansion and my rating stands.

Too hard to get a group together to play this one. For me, the way fleets are handled is too abstract.

A person can win without any obvious military or economic advantage on the board.

One play, with an expansion, so take my rating with a game of salt.  However on further thought, I doubt I'll be playing this again, but I could be talked into it if a game needed a 4th player.  I've never hated and loved a game so much at the same time.

I played it in a 7-player game with 5 of us having never played before.  So..it took a little bit to get going because of both not knowing how to play, and having a board big enough to fit 7 people.  In hindsight, I made a metric crapton of mistakes, but next time around, I have an idea of what I'll be doing...  bwa ha ha ha ha.

Some notable moments:  threatening the guy next to me into a favorable trade agreement.

Next time around:  I think 5-player might actually be a little more fun with this game, and give me a chance to see a little ebb and flow happen with this.

.........

Additional thoughts the next day, on reflection of playing 3 games of agricola or 2 games of le havre or 6 games of finca or 4 games of thurn and taxis or 8 games of zooloretto in the same time as one game of twilight imperium:  You know what this game is?  It's a eurogame for grognards.  That is, it's as slow, prohibative, and tactical as any wargame you could possibly think of, with the addition of those zany eurogame antics about building things and getting 'special' rule-breaks that go on.  

In the end, I like a lot of conflict, and I mean a LOT of conflict...and when you can easily go an hour without getting in a fight with anyone, or heck, even winning the game without getting in a fight with anyone, you're just spending points and building things.  Spend points, build stuff.  Spend points, build stuff.   ...which is done much better in a game of CIV IV on the computer, or something.  Even the interactions with other people aren't as advanced and 'zany' as much as finding a way to be more efficient than they are.

Much more, most of the conflict I did have was with myself.  "Oh, I can't do this"  "Oh, I can't do that".  "Oh, I should be doing this..."  and it wasn't actually things I inflicted on other players or had them inflict on me.  I mean, in 4 hours, I think I said "You sunuva!" at someone else maybe three times and at the game itself probably 30.  Whereas, in most of the typical games on my shelf I've had to make something of nothing or make a block move, or grab something very useful at least 5 times in the first half-hour.

HOWEVER, I can't get out of my head, what I would do if I were invited to play this again.

The game:  We would all start with 4 additional technologies of our choosing.  Next up, everything would get +1 movement.  Additional victory points for taking out someone else's home planet.  3 additional action cards and 4 political cards to start the game with.  The board, if not for the +1 movement, could be made much smaller.  That would be AOK by me as well.

How I played:  I played with the lizix mindnet.  I'd want to play with them again.  I'd set my fleet capacity to 4, two carriers and two dreadnauts filled with fighters.  I'd make a daisy-cutter around the board taking down everyone in my path.  Victory points?  Screw that.  I care about one victory point:  "All your base are belong to me, b;tches!"  Pretty doable, build a bunch, send 'em out.  The downside is that a dreadnought with a movement of 1, and a board measuring three deep from entity to entity, at 10 minutes a turn, mean it's 10 minutes at least between butt-kickings.  

...which tells me one thing, and one thing only.  This is a wargame.  I played this game, and the only thing I want to do in this game is break stuff.  Break lots of stuff.  This wouldn't be bad, but it wants to be a diet-coke eurogame with most of the interactions being pretty much player v. board.  Why bother building all these warships when only 2 out of the 8 victory points that first come up have anything to do with offense?  Do I have to worry about anyone reaming my base when there's no points in it?  Systemically, I'd like to see more creative fighting goals to go with this game's very rich combat focus, because if it wants to be a eurogame, I can think of faster games that achieve the same ends giving me more of the eurogame buck for my minutes played.

Finally, finally got this game to the table.  Took 7hrs to do a 5 person game, which is what I was expecting.  All of us were new, and while I was familiar with the rules, some of the other players were not.  Took a few rounds to get the hang of things, but overall the gameplay itself is actually relatively fast.

Although the playtime is long, the downtime is minimal.  Am looking forward to getting this game to the table again, and particularly enjoyed the difficulty in choosing how/when to spend command counters.  Rated it an 8 for now but could easily see this game shooting up to a 10 with a few more playthroughs.  Important to note that it does take a dedicated gaming group to make it enjoyable though.  Putting TI on the table is an event, not a game.

After playing it again, it's my favourite game. Hands down.  Just so complex, so amazing.

According to my experience and BGG's system, I should give this game a rating just below 7. The game length matches its epic scope, however the mechanics seem a bit dated, meaning there are games that implement the same kind of feeling in a more elegant way. 

Getting your ecomonic/war/tech machine ready and functioning takes something like 1.5-2 hours and the game only becomes interesting after this bit. Also, I got the feeling that it really shines in a 6p game, and that makes it even more difficult to bring to the table ( not including the big downtime between player turns ).

I had a lot of expectations about this title. I've played and I will keep playing it. TI3 is a mix of rules and systems taken by many games, as aGoT. The result is a game with many good aspects, but not having a balanced assemble. Roles are not identical. IMO political part is too much unimportant. TI3 success and replaybility depends mostly by the group playing it. Can be an epic and fantastic game, as a boring and broken one. I prefer to play with the FFG website ISC variant. But that's is up to you. Conflict is not a true necessity and this is a shame. Who doesn't like a big interstellar war :-))) I guess there is need for further playtesting and probably, as aGot teach us, there will be an expansion fixing the game.Anyway FFG made a very good production job, as the game is gorgeous and has a very strong theme. There is room to improve it, as is in process to be done by FAQ and new rules appeared on FFG site.To resume this is a game that is good if played with the right attitude and not in an overcompetitive mood. In such conditions is very fun.Worth to be tried, expecially if you are a big fan of epic galactic empires conflicts.

The mechanisms for collecting victory points are screwed-up as hell, though you can use house rules to fine-tune precisely what level of screwed-up-ness you're prepared to deal with. It will take you all day to play. And it is one of the finest space opera experiences you will ever get from a tabletop game. Imperfect, but nevertheless outstanding, and well worth a try if you've never played.

This really is an epic game. It takes a long time to play, but every second is worth it. It has everything you could wish for in an epic space game. There's civ building as you expand your empire to gain resources and influence. It has fighting, negotiation and politics (is there a difference) and interweves these in a brilliant way. Races strong in influence tend to be low on resources so there is always something to negotiate about. The tech development system and variable race powers make the game even more involved. But what makes this game rise above it's predecessor is the role selection mechanic they took from Puerto Rico. Take into account the bad rules organization, need for the first expansion and great components which are standard issue with a Fantasy Flight Game and you have a very good game if you can afford the time investment.

With both expansions this is one of my favorite games, although I don't have that much experience playing it, especially with a full table.

My only complaint is that it is too long for a casual get together, but then that is a good thing, too!

This makes a great 2 player game as well. We've been playing with the following rules, which are heavily derived from the Shattered Ascension variation rules:
- use 2-ring galaxy with home planets set on opposite sides and an asteroid field in the middle. Players take turns choosing from randomly dealt tiles and then construct the board. First player to choose a tile is the last player to place a tile:
    - 2 red bordered tiles (besides asteroid field in middle);
    - 4 blank tiles;
    - 10 planet tiles.
- Strategy Phase: both players pick 3 Strategy Cards.
- Status Phase: both players only receive 1 Command Counter (rather than 2).
- Trade: Races may trade with themselves, but only 1 agreement.
- Politics and Assembly: a die is rolled to randomize vote (per Shattered Ascension).

The mother-load of tile-laying space conquest games.  Think RISK with a large unit selection, with a variable board (laid out by randomly picking tiles in turn and choosing where to place them before the game starts), resource management, and diplomacy.

Good expansions that add more complexity, although occasionally removing some.

This game is very good, but it is typically very long. You're really going to need to set aside an entire day to play this game through.  If like the sound of it, but the length scares you, I'd suggest looking at Eclipse instead.

Copy of game from Guy M. I'll need another shelving unit to store it and all my recent acquisitions...

I am still on the fence about this game, but see enough promise in it to be happy about this most recent addition to my game collection.

On the one hand, it's a superb piece of game design. The roles are integrated perfectly with the board, and the rules are robust. Only the objective cards and the Imperial SC need attention, and apparently they get that attention in the first expansion.

On the other hand, the last two games proved to me that I'm just not good at building an imperial tableau that is flexible enough to get a VP per turn. Last game with Damon made me really unhappy about the game itself. We were teaching two new players, and he and I got into something of a fight over whether to give strategic information to Linette and Leigh (a situation the would overwhelm them, but I maintain also hand the victory to Damon, the better player), or let them make their own mistakes (a situation I was unhappy with as I was still trying to grasp how to actually WIN this bloody game, though Damon had figured it out, and I wanted the game to go long enough to get a sense for how to win). In the end, Damon won by a margin of six points - AGAIN.

My problem is simple - the VAST BULK of movements on the board do not translate into VPs. In fact, the only thing that does score points is the selection of roles. I want to play it again to see if I can avoid getting distracted by the game and just play the roles. This is a sad sentiment, and reflects a bad design choice; namely that the least well-integrated part of the game undoes one of the most subtle and well-designed parts. That is, the blunt instrument of the objective deck basically trashes the glorious integration between roles cards and board.

As far as I can see, the objectives reward good play of the roles - they are based around technology, trade goods, resources - the only reason to have a fleet is to conquer enough to ensure these basic needs. In fact, once you have ten resources/influence you can afford technology every round, or pay for logistics to get more CP.

If I can get good at the base game, I might consider expansions. A big part of my problem is how bad I am at the game, and how easy Damon makes it look to build a game-winning, flexible tableau. So easy that I wonder if the game is somewhat broken, since we've never got past the yellow objective cards before he's won.

The sad thing is, I like the fact that you can win with no fleet. I just dislike the fact you can't choose a strategy - in fact, your strategy is chosen for you by the vicissitudes of the objective deck. The designers say "flexibility" is key, but in my three plays of the game thus far, it means a combination of aggressive exploitation of the role cards and bland generalisation of your empire. I especially don't like how your ability to move towards an end goal is sometimes simply foreclosed by the turn of an objective card that hands the game to your opponent.

I really want to stop one nasty experience (the last time we played, and taught Leigh and Linette) making me hate this game.

Two other things - I really dislike the "foregone conclusion" effect. The game has a nasty habit of reaching a conclusion but taking two hours to conclude. That is, one runaway leader can claim enough victory points to win twice over and you can't stop them (because they already have enough of whatever to win), but you need to play out the turns as resolution.

The rule we missed - that you can prevent this sort of thing by taking over a home system - is a bad fix, because all that does is knock that player out of the game. So the options are:

1) Give up and say they won. Save two hours,

2) Play the game through, knowing you can't win, or

3) attack their home system, making them grumpy and (probably) letting someone else win.

The more I think about it, the more I think that the objectives need to be much harder to achieve and much more specific, and possibly revealed at a rate of two or three per turn, so you have meaningful choices to make that are reflected in board position, not role selection.

A game with huge scope, that takes a long time to play. Some areas the game explores are more prominent than others but in essence it revolves around a diplomacy of threats and disguising your strategies for as long as possible. Then massing fleets and brinkmanship.

Unfortunately, trading is inexcusably weak, pulling diplomatic attempts down. Politics is fun and engaging but all too often the politics strategy lies neglected since the reward to pick it is too small.

PROS: This game solves several problems of previous versions. Mechanically it's best new feature is the addition of strategy cards which add flexibility while reducing down-time. TI3 also builds off its previous strengths; thematically this game is *stunning*. The artwork, components, and chrome are just luscious. CONS: Having the Imperial Strategy Card grant VP causes a selection loop that dominates the game and weakens gameplay. A couple of the objective cards are ridiculously imbalanced, as are many of the Action Cards. Nothing has been done to address turtling-up and amassing forces. OVERALL: A fun yet frustrating 4x game. It's still very glitchy, but the chrome keeps me coming back. Though play-time is shortened immensly from previous versions, at 5+ hours, it's still a weekend-only game.

Have played several games now and, while fun, is really too long, slow-moving, and complex for what it tries to achieve. Some of the big problems involve the components themselves: The ships are much too large for the hex tiles--which are themselves fairly large. The player mats don't utilize their alloted space very efficiently and the flavor text for the races is wasted space that could be better used for something else. The Secondary Ability on the Strategy Cards should be printed on the backs, since players are usually performing their secondary ability action while the card is face-down. After that... Combat is fiddly if there are more than a couple ship types, techs, and action cards involved. The game is laden with several kinds of small cards which must be kept track of. Games drag after initial expansion phase. Turtling is a big problem...

What do I like? The opening turns of exploration, development, posturing, and sparring are fun. A game to just 10 turns can be fun. Deciding how to spend/allocate command points among Strategic Allocations, Fleet Supply, and Command Points is pretty fun. Battles with a up to a dozen pieces on a side are fun--mainly because they mean a lot if that is the best both sides can muster.

When I played this first at Gen Con I thought it one of the best boardgames in existance.

It's a *very* long game but incredibly rewarding to play. Sadly it doesn't see much table time due to the commitment needed to play it. The strategy cards included in the base game lead to a pretty boring meta-game. The cards included in Shattered Empire have livened it up a lot.

THE GAME.  My group plays this almost exclusively.  With some heavy house rules and huge amounts of deal-making, the four of us play a massive game over 3 nights (one night a week), from about 8pm until 1am.

This game has mastered the art of minimising downtime.  In fact, we normally want more time to consider our next move.  I almost find this game stressful at times - it can be very unforgiving if you make a mistake.

One of those big games that you have to play at least once, just to say you've been there. This is an empire building game on a hex board, set in space. Lots of nice plastic spaceships to move around the board, planets to take over and a tech tree and some politics tacked on the side to make things interesting. As usual, the player who avoids war the longest will most likely win!

RATING: 7
I originally gave this an 9 but this game has the same flaws most FFG games have. The more you play it the more you realise something is missing.

In our group we usually see very few fights , so a big part of the game you are playing alone , colonizing , building and taken strategy cards. Victory comes automatically after everyone has taken the 8 card. (and the one who completes the most secondary/primary objectives wins)

I think the game would have played better if some of the secondary objectives would have stimulated conflicts ; for example "the first player that invades another player's planet gets 2 VP" 

Best with 4 players (plays quicker)
Much too slow with 5 or 6.

It's on it's way!  Now to decide if the first game is going to be with expansion or without expansion!

I've read the rules, gone through the online tutorial and a dry-run of the game by myself, so I'm ready to play!  Looks like an amazing game with tons of depth and piles of options.

First real game is complete, the game is pretty darn fun!  Tons of rules and plenty of details to try and keep straight.  Three player game took about 6 hours to complete.

I love the game, but it takes a long time to play.  Now that Runewars is out, I find I can get some of the TI experience with less downtime and more action in 1/3 of the time.  TI3 will still hit the table, but it might be once a year or so.

Runewars is leaving the collection but TI is staying.  Something about this game makes me want to play it!

This game is an epic game of space politics and control. I'd give it a higher score if could be played in a sane amount of time. I've never had a game go less that 6 hours and most go 8ish.

RATING: 10
What a fantastic game. It has it all. Politics, intrigue, war, threats, manipulation, backstabbing. It takes a LONG time to play but well worth the time investment.

12/30 - 4 player game, 6 hours to finish, Played as L1Z1X Mindnet. Had control of Mecatol Rex and secret objective of having Mec Rex w/ a space dock and 6 ground forces. Was backstabbed by an 'ally' that came in when my home planet was shabbily defended and took control of it. I lost out on a Victory point because of this. Never got to finish my secret objective because the Imperium Rex card came out on the first turn of Phase 2 Objectives. Winner was Emirates of Hakkan with 8 VP, the others were at 7 and 6 and I had 6 VP as well. 

1/6 - 5 player game,Played as Sardakk N'orr. Imperium Rex bit me again. I was 1.5 rounds from winning and it had a 33.3% chance to come out. Person in the lead was devastated. Had no home system left and barely any fleet. He won when it came out.

5/26 - 5 player game, played as Naalu Collective. Person with the Clans of Saar jumped out in the lead and the rest of us never caught up. He won with VPs, our first time the game didn't end with Mecatol Rex coming out. We played with Shattered Empire expansion and strategy cards.

One word best describes this LONG.  Not that I mind long games...I have some of the super heavy wargames.  The problem here is probably long with not enough tension.  Sometimes turns just seem to drag on without a lot of action.  While I love the pieces and the rules seem very interesting it does not seem to hold my interest over the life of a game and I feel like i'm just going through the motions when we play this.  My son would probably give it a 8 but he just loves the pieces and anything with a space theme. lol

RATING: 8.5
This one has been hotly debated over its lifetime of three versions and people tend to either love it or hate it. However, after initial reservations based on the strong tendency for the game to reward "turtling," I have had to adjust my assessment upward, especially with the release of the expansion which fixes much of what I found problematic with the series up to that point. The expansions offer a myriad of extras and options such that the whole series is really a game kit out of which you can make almost anything you want in a 4X space game.

Nonetheless, a persistent issue is the long playing time, even with the "fast-start" options. If you can picture yourself playing "Civilization" (the classic AH version) then this may be for you. The release of "Eclipse" has likely replaced this game for many as the "go-to" epic space-opera experience based on its more reasonable playing time and slick design. I do wish from time to time though that I could get my group to give this another try. This truly is the "Magic Realm" of space-opera games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm unsure of this rating. The game advances too slowly and once someone gets the upper hand it's almost impossible to catch them. Have tried different house rules but since it is a 4 hour game anyway there's almost never anybody willing to play it. I haven't tried the expansion yet, and I hope we will get around to it someday soon.

RATING: 5
Rating based on limited play - looks great but it's a long game (maybe too long) and the chit activation mechanic seems a little unfinished. Retreats for example are odd, you can only retreat to a system you've already activated - meaning it's possible to retreat forward (with careful chit placement) or be in a position where you can't retreat at all ... I prefer TI2.

What I like:  Role selection with the secondary actions, awesome command counter system, and the tech tree.  What I don't:  Too many objectives involving, and therefore too much emphasis on, Mecatrol Rex.  Hardly worth having big battles over any other system.  Action cards (for me) add too much randomness and extra time to the game.  The Political Action might be great in another game, but just added more down time and complexity to an already epic game.  At this point I would take out the Diplomacy and Political roles, and thus the action and political cards. Also, I would like to see better objectives, including one or two race specific along with the secret objective.

I'm really not sure how I feel about this game. It is a fairly deep 4x game, but it doesn't seem to play very "smoothly". I used to rate it a 9.2, but now I don't ever want to play it again. Looking back on the game, I don't understand how I enjoyed it so much. Nowadays I'd rather play Starcraft instead.

edit: dammit, another game I wish I would've kept. It took several years but I finally want to play it again.

edit: played again recently and it was so boring. I'm glad I traded it away. 

Is there another sci-fi game as deep as this? Perhaps not, but that doesn't automatically make this a great game.

5x5 2017.  Big long epic sci-fi war game.  I dig the universe which has a lot of flavor while remaining abstract enough that you can sort of tell your own stories.  I love the expansions and all the different modules you can add to the game which really make it more of a game system than a single game.  The game is pretty strategic and forces you to make at least medium term plans.  A great main event for a long afternoon-into-evening game session.

Changed from 5.5 to 3.5 after second play. 
Second time winning the game of two plays but we where only 5players this time. But will only play when I'm desperate and being nagged on. Hopefully never. I get that some players enjoy this but Hells to the no for me. 

Comment from first play
Played in a group of 6, to long (11h)and booring combat. House ruled it to make it faster with shared objectives. Still didnt manage to end it in our 11h window, we where all first time players thou.

I like that you pick roles and the command tokens. 

That it is so many components that factor of not haveing a clue what may happend or come up is a negative for me in this case since the game weight is basicly more then i like, and the lenght.

Played only a single game to get the feeling of the rules. Even a single game was so much fun that I can't wait to play with real players.
So many variations to use, and then not even counting in the expansion :)
--- Update ---
Played with four players and it was a blast.
A lot of options to concider in each turn. Always need to have an eye on the other players what they are up to.
Smooth rules, with nice options to add when you feel for it. 
It has a depth that you only see the beginning to in the first game.
It has it all strategy, theme, depth, variety and timing.
A true classic with the new rules.

TI3 has it all... politics, war, trading, alliances, treachery, negotiation, empire-building... such a great game! It is very long, and can be quite the task to setup and put away, but the gameplay flows well and is interesting. There can be a slight runaway leader problem, and if you make a big mistake early on, it can be hard to recover, but I still think TI is an awesome game. Now I just wish I had larger chunks of free time that could be devoted to it.

Good first play. Definitely need to play again to solidify my rating. Lots of solid gameplay elements, from the Strategy role cards, to economy, to negotiations and battle.

Still, given its length I'm not in an immediate hurry to replay.

I love the deepness of this game's mythos.  It's not just a game to play, but a story to tell and retell.  Yes, this is a monstrously long game, but I've always been partial to completely immersing myself in a world for hours on end.  The difficulty is finding other gamers who want to share such a lengthy and immersive experience.  High quality components, a modular board, and an inspired turn control system adds to the appeal.  A never-ending supply of rule technicalities detracts, but it a game this big and complex, I'd be more surprised if this wasn't the case.  This is my style, even if I can't find others to play very often.  It's a definite keeper.

This is like a longer and more involved game of Nexus Ops, I love the variability and depth in this game.  With Secret Objective Cards, Public Objective Cards, Political Cards, 10 Races, A good Tech Tree and a random Map this game will never be the same twice.

Twilight Imperium gives you an individual empire, then provides you with an opportunity to develop and deepen the individuality of that empire by expanding in terms of resources, influence, technology and military.  You can pursure different strategies and seek to develop along differnt lines, technology is the quickest way of stamping some individuality on your race for the game, but resource rich empires will get to build more, influence rich empires will have a serious impact on the direction Political Cards take the game and rules - and this can have a significant impact on the future of the game.

Players must actively peg back other players, they must be aggressive and in some cases merciless, if they want to get the edge that will help them win.  In this sense players must demonstrate some gamesmanship, cunning, clever play and be able to take on the metaphoric 'role' of their empires, threatening where required, blustering and bluffing where necessary and cutting their losses when a deal or situation goes bad.  This is not a game for the faint-hearted.

Altogether this game is a very enjoyable experience I look forward to having again.  I like the way the game keeps you involved, even when it isn't your turn, a game of this size needs to.  I like the many avenues open, and despite everything I had read and heard to the contrary I really liked the pace and time it takes to play - things happen quickly and the game time seems to go swiftly.  This is a real joy - I am very happy to own it.

As originally presented with the Imperial Strategy Card the game is a 6 because while it is neat, being forced to select ISC for your first choice and Initiative for your second choice really sucked almost to the point of making me prefer the old second edition. Using a house rule to fix that problem such as just ditching the ISC card completely makes the game an 8, and using the Shattered Empire expansion makes it a 9.  In fact, I can't really imagine playing the game without the expansion now that we've used it. Makes me believe that the saying that Fantasy Flight releases incomplete games that are fixed by their expansions might really be true.  Too bad you have to pay $80-$120 to get a complete game.  But wow what a game! I prefer the 14 point game as the 10 point one ends too soon even though the length is more monstrous.

Finally played this after months of talking about it. The rules are very complex at first (especially if you are someone like me who has never played Axis and Allies and who doesn't play war games generally) and yes the game really is very long! Once you can find people to play against and the time to play it, on top of learning/teaching the complex rules, the game is good. The role selection mechanic (along with the turn-order and secondary action considerations that go with it) is really what makes the game interesting: choosing between acquiring or removing command tokens, gaining free techs, getting action cards or choosing new objectives, etc., can be very tricky and provide a great amoung of strategic depth.

UPDATE: Who am I kidding? This game is a bloated, overwrought monster that because of its size, length, and complexity pretends to be more interesting than it really is. We will never play this again.

I'm actually shocked at how much I enjoyed this.  I typically hate Fantasy Flight Designs, but everything seems to work really well.  It can be a brutal game, and if you don't take it too seriously, this is actually a great time.

RATING: 10
Twilight Imperium is the ultimate Ameritrash game.  Awesome space ships, unique alien races, piles of dice.  All these things, built up around a fun, strategic core.

For me, TI has the perfect mix of theme, luck, politics and strategy.  Players must plan carefully, negotiate well and make good alliances to have a shot at the victory.  The game rewards a focus on objectives, while still providing lots of room to build up your civilization in fun ways.

The usual complaints are that the rules are complicated or that it takes too long to play.  The core of the rules is quite simple, but as with any game with dozens of unique player powers and thousands of cards, there will be exceptions.  Luckily, there is such a community built up around this game that it's easy to find answers.  As for time, in our group, we almost always finish in under an hour per player - a long game, but not nearly as long as Advanced Civilization or something.

Every bit as good as the original, but different in a few critical areas.  I am desperately looking forward to my next session.  You have to be much more wary in third edition, as victory points can be acquired in many ways, and you never really know who is winning...  Rating unchanged after four six-player games.  UPDATE:  Since played three more times, and my opinion stands.  A True 10.  (Or high 9, as my new rating reflects.)  Tee-hee!

I've only played one complete game of this. I had very high hopes when I first bought and read through the rules umpteen times. It was not as awesome as I had built-up in my mind. I still have high hopes, but haven't found the time to play again. My fear is that this game will gather dust, eventhough it's high on my replay want list. 

We found the movement a bit hard to grasp at first. The whole concept of where/when to place markers during the various turns etc... Many aspects of this game I love and when I have a few more games under my belt I wll re-write this review.

Way too complicated and it takes way to long. Setting up takes an hour at minimum and playing it would take a whole day. If you start early. 
Strategically fun though, miniatures are cool, artwork and extra fluff are very nice too.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent game full of subtleties.  Wide array of strategic options and ways to play.  The designer (FFG) gives excellent support.  Probably the best strategy game I've ever played.  Note: it's not a *war* game, even though war is one aspect.

RATING: 9
Absolutely love the theme of this game, and it's the closest I've come to playing Masters of Orion as a boardgame.  The emphasis on point gathering rather than building up an empire and engaging in space battles might be a bit disappointing, but you can't escape the cool factor.  Even better with the expansion. Very long game, though.

Had to lower my rating of this game because of excessive turtling (we even tried making a smaller map to stop this) and dumb luck, which can really make this game unenjoyable and drag out for the unlucky player... If the board happens to be set up so you have few resources near your home system, you're effectively screwed for the game. If you're supposed to play this for the next 3 hours, you shouldn't be screwed before you even start, that's just poor design. Luck plays too much of a role for this to be a game you play for the strategy. Don't buy it if you like to battle a lot either. Sometimes the political cards and negotiating/bribing with other players can be fun if the game is close, but that's about all the real action you get. Read Alexfrog's review to hear more, he put together a list of grievances. Make sure you do your homework on this game and decide if Alexfrog's comments bother you before you drop the cash for it; it definitely isn't cheap...

Remarkably epic game! I get asked, "how do you play a board game for 8 hours?!". Honestly there are not many boardgames I would want to play for a full day but this game is one that keeps you interested and invested. Playing TI3 is an event that I am happy to attend at every opportunity.

i have actually never played this game without any of the expansions.  I feel odd giving it a 7 because I like the game a lot more with the expansions included but the base game has the imperial card problem and drags at times.  Overall TI has great interaction, thematic qualities, epic story-like experiences with backstabbing, and unexpected twists and turns.

RATING: 3
The most epic fail rules of all time.  Easily 90% of my games involved the big forces teaming up against the weaker guy.  How lame!

Epic fail system that promotes attacking the weak players.  Epic fail system that doesn't allow a surrender option in the rules when it's hopeless which would have been useful in 100% of my games.  Now because of that 5 out of the 6 games I've played...  Someone has quit(50% of my games), threatened to quit because this game sucks(2 out of 6 of the games), or someone has whined about how much this game sucks while playing it.

Now, you may think these stats are impossible, right?  Kublacon 16 hour game (1 person quit by putting all 15 CC's into fleet without a fleet - suicide...), anonymous#1's house (everyone quit because the outcome was obvious but we didn't want to play for another 3 hours to find out), PbF#1 Letnev threatened to quit by leaving for half a month, PbF#2 Yssaril quit in round 1 turn 1 (Basically; if it looks like you are not winning; just threaten to quit or demand a reroll), Anonymous#2's house(houseruled all VP points open to everyone, ?? still threatened to quit because this game is $$)..

There was only one extremely houseruled game where nobody quit and it ended pretty fast.  The person who won never attacked anyone, and never was attacked.  That says a lot for this game...

Hence, a game that MUST be houseruled to be even playable is NOT a game at all.  I would easily give this a zero for the game play and crappy rules, but the components and story/theme is worthy of a point or two.  All you are buying here is the components and story; but you need to create the game yourself to make it playable.  Perhaps you can play TI with pure roleplay with a GM, just like in D&D roleplay games.  At least this way the broken rules can be GM'd away.

Epic attempt for an epic fail game. 3 out of 10

With 2 Expansions:
- Shattered Empire
- Shards of the Throne

Play it 3-4 times a year, but oh my, what a great 3-4 days a year I have. This game has flaws- but they become part of it's charm. After 8 hours of play, the only description of how I feel is: gamergasmic

I have won a couple of games being a warmonger, with plenty of dice rolling, yes. However, I have also won a game (8 hours) without ever rolling the dice, not once. There is plenty of diplomacy in this game, which if played right, can steer you out of luck dependent situations (such as battles with dice).

RATING: 4
Played this for the first time in many, many years recently (with the first expansion which was a first for me).

So first up: I have a heavy bias against these types of extremely long "epic" games with tons of rules overhead, etc. It's just really, really not my bag. [i]Additionally, I'm not even into 4X games[/i] as they tend to be all about turtling, which I really dislike, and is certainly true of this game. Being the first to strike at someone else generally just means you're opening yourself up to attacks from other players.

That said - with the first expansion mixed in this is about as much fun as I can have with one of these kinds of games. I can genuinely have fun with these, but it's very much a mood thing for me.

This game still gets a 4 because without the expansion's replacement role cards, the game of keep-away that happens with the "gain 2 vp" role card just irritates me. Yeah it makes the game shorter, but christ, there must be other ways to achieve that (play to less VP, for example) without instead making the whole game revolve around this one stupid role card.

Unsurprisingly for an "epic" American 4X game, combat is pretty cumbersome and mostly revolves around a fairly standard roll-to-resolve system with some swingy action cards to shake things up. It also becomes increasingly long and complex as the game progresses as players obtain more relevant tech, with no real interesting decisions to be made during combat rounds. Building up your fleet and tech trees is fun and satisfying, but I will always take a game with more going on [i]during[/i] combat over this.

And speaking of tech trees, one of my huge complaints with this game is just the presentation. It feels like there's been no attempt made to help the players keep track of their ever-changing stat bonuses and perks. In a game with SO much to keep track of, having these dinky little tech cards all over the place just doesn't cut it. The game would have benefited HUGELY from some kind of adjustable character sheet (ala Eclipse). The next time I play I'm definitely going to try out one of those fan-made iOS apps, because the way it is now is just garbage and does nothing but lengthen the game unnecessarily.

In general, it feels like there's a bunch of neat ideas here that presented some real balance and length issues and the way the designers attempted to correct them is just to add a ton of swingy content and these little micro-systems all over the place. 

For example, the only way I can imagine the leaders are a necessary part of the base game is if they're there for balance purposes. But addressing a balance issue by adding in this tiny ancillary system that feels like it could be removed wholesale just makes me rage. It may seem like a small thing but all of these little things add up.

And don't even get me started on the swingy content. Ancient Artifact, where you can wipe someone out from Mecatol Rex entirely? Or how about all of those "You win the game!" objective cards? All of these things speak to greater issues with the game.

Update: Last time we played I tried one of the iOS companion apps - it really, really sped the game up for me. So (a) I highly recommend using one if you're going to play this and (b) I have confirmation that the game's poor presentation w/r/t your units' ever-changing stats, etc., slows the game down.

RATING: 3
A little bit too long for this type of game. The action cards are a big let down - surely a highly intelligent race would be able to make its own decisions on what it can do, rather than being given a random event they can perform. It also feels like there is something missing half way through, and the battles can take quite a long time, and hence the downtime can be quite frustrating. Most of the new mechanics have been taken from the likes of P/Rico. Stay with the previous edition, much quicker gameplay, downtime a fraction of 3rd, and a four player game can easily be completed within a couple of hours. Pieces are certainly a lot better in third, but that's all that's better.

RATING: 7
Beautiful production.  Oodles of bits.  Huge color rule book with lots of optional rules.  Is that good?  Time will tell.  Plastic mini's are a pain to get to come out clean.  
Initial Reaction:  Some action cards can really effect the balance.  In the second round the Sol player had a card that gave him advanced fighters.  Advanced fighters allow the fighters to fly around without a transport.  Fighters don't count against fleet limits.  Fleet limits is one of the three things that you have to balance with command tokens.  Understand?  I will need more play to determine how much the action cards really turn things upside down.   Edit 8/31/08:  Some things in this game are not balanced.  Does a game always have to be perfectly balanced to be fun?  TI3 suggests the answer is no.  With lots of options and the right people to play with, this game is FUN!!!  I'll move up to 9 and there it may stay.

It didn't.  Other more elegant games, scratching the same itch, have replaced it for me.  Still good memories and good game.

The best 4x sci-fi tabletop game. 

Though you have to play with people who play to win; if your friend brings his girlfriend, and she plays kingmaking for him or vice-versa, it's impossible to stop his/her victory. You have to manage very limited resources to expand your empire in every direction (colonizing, techs, fleets, defenses, laws, victory point, diplomacy etc), so if one player gets support in exchange of out-of-game benefits, the balance of the game goes thought the window and 2/3 of your friends will feel like they lost 6 hours of their time.

The defining game of space opera grand strategy (if that is not a genre, it should be). The balance between the races are great, even if they play to widely different strenghts and weaknesses. The game mechanic is unusually interactive with minimum downtime. The game benefited from the two expansions to such a degree that I would say it drops maybe two stars without them.

I have owned the game since release and I still rate this as my best overall strategy game

RATING: 5.5
Bought TI3 and its expansions from a guy as it is one of the games any serious gamer must have played at least once I think. However, I quickly realised that I would probably never get it to the table as I don't know a lot of guys who would be willing to spend 6-10 hours+++ on this game... But fortunately I later got to try it twice (so far):

In the first game, I was positively surprised by Twilight Imperium 3. While I certainly don’t want to play it all the time, and probably only a couple of times in a decade (due to its massive length!), it is actually not a bad game. I had feared that I, being a hardcore eurogamer, would hate it, but it actually has a lot of euro features which I was very fond of. Sure, you roll dice etc. and the combat can be very random and swingy (along with MANY other random elements...), but the main mechanism is about role selection and fulfilling victory conditions which give you points, and the first to 10 points wins the game!

I like the tech tree and various technologies (although it can be a little overwhelming and confusing the first time), the secret objectives (such mission cards, which can also be found in games like Nexus Ops, is something I love), the various units, how you spend actions points in three different areas etc. 

But the length of the game, yikes… That, along with the random die rolls which can mean a lot and is especially annoying when playing a game lasting for at least 8 hours, is the main reason why I don’t always want to play it. But, to be sure, I had expected it to be much worse. After my second play, I have decided to lower my rating as it is too long (the game took 10 hours with 5 players; a couple of beginners and the rest had tried it before). Also, there was too much luck to my taste with the hidden tokens on each planet - I mean, what's up with the fact that you can lose all of your troops, while another lucky person might get a free tech?! Even if you play it with the rule that only good tokens are placed around your starting planet, it's still random and unbalanced and actually loses some tension. Furthermore, it sucked extremely much to have the game end in a 3-way tie after 10 hours...

I am willing to try it one more time, but it has to be with 6 players (as the game doesn't really work with 5, even if you use the setup variant), and people have to be willing to negotiate. Still, in 10 hour I can play SO many of my favorite games instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The set up phase is fun but can totally wreck your chances of winning if your home system gets surrounded with wormholes and empty space (unless occupying the wormholes is your goal). After three or four turns the game can stagnate if no one is willing to attack first. Some races' special abilities aren't much cop compared to others. The base game needs a few fixes which are addressed in the Shattered Empire expansion. The Imperial card, for instance, that gives a 2VP bonus is a dull but essential choice and can screw up the chances of players near the end of the initial turn order if they don't get to pick it as often. Rated a 7 with 3 players. Not so good with a full complement simply due to the downtime.

I would rate this game very lower (a 2?) if you don't have the right set of people.  It is fare too involved with many different parts so only an advanced gamer will do well playing this . . . but it is too much like a Euro to  appeal to traditional wargamers.

It was pointed out that the game plays like "Nexus Ops".  There are also various rules that don't follow basic logic making for more problems as cerain things come about during the game.  With teaching a full game with six players this could easily take 6 - 8 hours (and sometimes more) . . . so the estimates are not properly done.

This game is long, but worth it.  A lot of things are going on but they all fit together nicely.  I really like how the public missions work for acquiring points and how some of the strategy cards interact with the game.  I highly recommend someone coming to the game with all the rules read two or three times, since there are a lot and trying to figure them all out at the table is a chore.  

--update. After much deliberation on the ISC (which is Imperial Strategy Card I finally figured out, wondered where the SC part came from 8P), I have decided I hate it.  The timer on the game is the 'end-game' mission.  The ICS is stupid and forces role selection and diminishes all the other roles.  I say, just throw it away and play with the other cards; not sure if that variant works but that's how I feel about it.

RATING: 7.5
Players: 3* − 6
*2 player variant available.

Very large game with an epic play time. Rules are not as fiddly as you might think, with something so grand, and are generally understandable after a few rounds. Borrows a lot of mechanics from other games, but blends them well. 

The victory point mechanic seems out of place in a Fantasy Flight flag ship game, given their current Ameri-centric lean on the game market, however it becomes a necessary component. Without it, the game would be a great deal more shallow.

If the game was meant to be won by obtaining the most planets, or having the largest war fleet alone, then any other action wouldn't be a viable strategy, however this game excels in the fact that other strategies are completely viable. It's much more than just "Risk in Space". The victory track helps here, keeping track of players achievements in all areas of the game.

While many decisive events within the game are decided upon by conquest and war between players, aspects such as politics, trade or technology are not overshadowed and serve to offer balance and alternative paths to victory. Focusing on a singular strategy leaves a player unguarded, one way or another. Switching focus plays a big part throughout the game.

Components are decent, adding a lot to the theme. The presentation can get quite cluttered, but all and all each bit serves a purpose. With players' vast, omnipotent view from above, it all seems a touch impersonal, compared to other games in which you're pushing plastic around. 

The story up front is very rich, but mainly goes out the air lock as soon as the game is underway. Flavor text seems best coming from the political cards, strangely enough. 

The political mechanics are one of the more interesting aspects of the game, to me, even though they are paper thin in a lot of cases. The only real hard-fast political rule is diplomacy, any other deals or favors are subject to betrayal, just as real as in real life.

Player elimination is a possibility... and in a game this long, that would suck. A lot.

Awesome game.  I'm not overly fond of the role-selection mechanic in a game like this, but the rest of the game is sooo dripping with theme and appropriate mechanics that its completely forgivable.  Takes a very long time to play and needs a dedicated group to tackle.  When you get it on the table, though, I have not found a more satisfying multiplayer game, period.

RATING: 7.5
Epic in every sense of the word. It seems like you need either an unlimited amount of time, or several plays of the game to get a satisfying experience out of it.  I really enjoyed the last hour of the last game I played, but that was coming on the heels of 5 hours of relative drudgery.  It's great when it gets going, but it takes a while to get going.

I believe this game is almost the perfect game.  Need to play it a lot more for it to become the perfect game.  My favorite part about the game is that there is a time frame in which you have to make a move or you will be left behind.  I also like how there is multiple ways you can go about winning.

I want to like this game, I really do.  If it was a two-player wargame, it would get lots of play.  But it's a really long multi-player game, and it's tough to find enough opponents.  I really like aspects of it, but there's just something there that doesn't click quite right.  The choose a strategy mechanic is great, but it doesn't quite work and the variants all seem to leave a little something to be desired.  But the flavor and experience, with the right group of people, can be lots of fun.  I do want to play this more, but it's going to be really tough.

RATING: 9.5
What if Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri was made into a great board game? The result would be TI3, which combines diplomacy, civilization building, and an Axis & Allies warfare-in-space game into a single 3-4 hour time block (which is acceptable to me, as a Miniature gamer). I would have no problem playing this game anytime, anywhere. 
Only two problems plague this game to me: one, like many others, I am disappointed by one of the Strategy cards that gives victory point directly - it's not a matter of measuring the exact amount of victory points to give in order to make it comparable in power to the other Strategy Cards, it's that the ability to give victory point directly should not be a power at all for the game). Second, (also a big gripe amongst people), the game's box is unnecessarily big - I fit the game into a box only 2/5 of the size of the original box, which actually allows me to bring with me to play at other friends houses, instead of being stuck at home.

Good game, but it is too long and tends to bore me after a while.  I probably will never play it again.

The more I think about it though, I want to give it another go.  Maybe it was just because there were 3 players, and the losing one chose me as the victim, which cost me a win.

RATING: 7
Tons of fine crafted components, excellent game system.  I have never seen a game that gives a player so much flexibility in his actions or how he will win the game and play it.  Not very difficult but the variety of choices make the game seem complex at first glance.
Age of Empire is a near perfect game.

This is a great game of war and politics. I definitely suggest playing with some of the optional rules, they add a lot. Make sure to play it with the first expansion, otherwise the original Imperial card ruins the game. One other thing to note about this game is that it takes a while to play... It is hard to fit in an afternoon. After numerous plays I have gotten irritated and bored with how the game progresses.

RATING: 2
Dire. Boring. Takes far too long to play and it only takes one player to get off to a good start and the rest of the players may as well pack up and go home. Too many pieces, badly written rules and just boring game play. Any game that takes a whole afternoon/evening to play needs to go back to the drawing board.

Rating with both expansions... A great and interesting game experience which heavily depends on the players with whom you play. You need at least 10 hours to play. If someone leaves the game after 3 hours, the game is over... that's its biggest down side. But this is definatly the best 4x board game. Great art work, interesting races (I love my virus :)) and unmatched game mechanics..

If you have the right group this game is a 10, if not it can be a 1..

Don't let my lower score deceive you, Twilight Imperium is easily a 10 in most people's books. But a 6 means that you'll play it when you're in the right mood, and therein lies the only problem with it. This 10 star game takes 10 hours to play (at least) and you're effectively giving up your day, if not your weekend, to get through it. It's the only complaint I've ever heard attributed to it, though I've heard every person say it at length.

Just achieves what it pretends, a mid complex, epic, long board game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Anticipation of what's possible makes this game move quickly - for a while. But, the realization of just how long it takes to get anything of significance accomplished dampens the experience. The theme is great but it's too easy to be put completely out of realistic contention - and the game just continues on and on way past that point. 

It also suffers from the problem of Player A attacks Player B, both are weakened, then Player C comes in and cleans up - which is a classic problem with games that have attrition/triangulation issues. For more on this concept, check out my blog here:

RATING: 7
I downgraded my rating from a 10 to a 7. Why? Because I feel that the system is to bland for what it wants to be. All of the alien races have these supposedly cool powers but they always use them for the same end, so it doesn't really matter. When I play with my friends we fall into our roles no matter what race we play because the penalty really isn't that great when we do, so Angel will be aggressive, even if he is the Jol-Nar, Rob will be a pacifist and Steve and I will bicker over resources. Which brings me to another gripe- resources. The game is SO random during the setup. If you get a one planet and the rest space in the draw you can pretty much give up right from the git go  because there is a tight curve you need to follow or be left behind and squashed because you only ever want to attack a player that is much weaker than you so you do not have to fear a counterstrike and mutual annihilation because there are no rewards for combat or consolations for losers. Often what will happen is player 1 and 2 will get into a fight severely weakening both sides, so players 6 and 3 will attack their neighbors and face little opposition. At least they fixed the ol' ISC in the expansion. Even with all this said I am still up for a game, just not as much as before.
Update 3/08
House rules to the rescue! I have finally found a good game with a few house rules added- now you get 3 planet systems, 1 wormhole/empty sytem and 1 red system durning set-up, Play with the ancient Empire varient WITH the Buracracy card, so that there will be twice as many objectives out, vote for Voice of the Council is manatory and its VP are PERMENENT, play with arfifacts, but use all artifacts avalible and add blanks when each playerr places one, play to 10 VP. Played like this 3 times and WE FINISHED EVERY GAME! AND IT WAS CLOSE! The winner usually bribed heavily early in the game to get a voice of the council vote or two, then took or had to defend key artifacts for a win, they were really great games!

11/08

personal preference, I can no longer teach newbies this game as there is just too much for me to explain, if someone new wants to learn and play then they would have to read the rules and especially all of the action cards before hand before I would play with them.

12/08
I think that we are pretty much done with this game, It is a great game when everyone is in the right mood, but poor otherwise with a great deal of downtime between turns.

10/09
Should be playing this soon again, probably with more house rules, I think 1 AC for the loser of a space battle, 1 Trade Good for the winner would work well, same for ground invasions, except perhaps the attacker couldn't get a card if he lost.

I can't believe what a great job Christian has done with creating a sort of Master of Orion: The Board Game! If you're into these sort of games, TI's rules will simply blow your mind with its depth and many cool mechanics such as different laws (i.e. rules) coming into play that the players must cast their votes for or against, or how about having both space AND ground combat? There's even a freakin' technology tree covering no less than 24 technologies! I admit it, I'm amazed. But really - this game IS just as good as everyone says it is, while still not as complex and difficult to learn as one may THINK. Throw in the expansion and this game gets a 10 out of 10. Wow...

RATING: 7.5
I respect what this game is trying to accomplish in becoming an epic space civilizations game. I'm a huge sci-fi nut. I've enoyed playing Masters of Orion for years.  Unfortunately, I think my window for getting really excited about this game may have closed. We'll see if more playings change my preliminary rating.

After my introduction to the game, there was a lively discussion about strengths and weaknesses and possible tweaks.  I am convinced that there is probably the right combination of variant rules to make this game really work, although I'm not so sure the rules out of the box do that. Granted, I realize I may be desiring the game to be different than the designers intended it or than another player may be looking for.

I just doubt that I have the interest to play a game this long and this light.  I have too many heavier games sitting unplayed.  If I want to play a game this long, I'd rather it be die Macher the majority of the time. I'd be up for this maybe twice a year at this point.

My biggest disappointment is that I want  a variety of strategies to be viable...but they aren't. I want a player to be able to win by military conquest...but its not possible. I want a player to be able to gain power through diplomatic maneuvering and calling votes....but he can't. I want a player to be able to gain victory through economic domination, but it doesn't work that way. You win by meeting a number of objectives that seem rather arbitrary to me. 

I know people won't ever play it with 4-6 players as it ought to be played, but for my money Babylon 5 CGS is superior to this game by about an order of magnitude.

It's a great game but 1) story/characters are lacklustre; 2) technologies could be more exciting; 3) the Imperal card makes the game easy to exploit, forcing players to unnaturally change their play style to prevent someone else from winning by sheer point advantage (high score but no significant army/territorial advantage).

I've flucuated on my opinion of TI:3 for well over a year now and I think that finally, after the release of the Shattered Empire expansion, I've made my peace with all of the minor flaws and quirks in the game and I've come to realize that it is- bar none- the best game of its type likely ever released.  It's really an amazing piece of design considering the vast scope and scale of the theme that it plays in a very reasonable amount of time while managing to present a fairly comprehensive game rich with detail, atmosphere, theme, and excellent mechanics.  There's certainly no lack of depth or player interaction in TI:3- to play the game is to be engaged in a much larger picture, reacting and negotiating with other races while jockeying for position and reaching for every victory point or objective possible.  Sure, there's some shaky bits here and there but to drag them out into the light really just magnifies the fact that this is a huge game with so much _good_, and so much _great_, going on that these problems are really quite minor.  My biggest problem before Shattered Empire was a general lack of momentum which was largely precipitated by a lack of focus in victory conditions.  Playing with the new strategy cards and the Age of Empire variant, this doesn't seem to be nearly the game-breaker it once was.  TI:3 has become one of the _great_ games, and it is likely to be one that is savored and enjoyed for many, many years to come.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Now, with the Shattered Empire expansion, this game goes from good to great.  The expansion fixes everything that held TI3 back and adds some new stuff.  Don't play without it if you can help it.

Epic game. Really enjoyed it (even though we only got 2/3 the way through after 8 hours on the first play - 5 players). Lots of complexity (particularly with the different expansions) and the rules take some time to get down to the point where you are able to play fluidly. 

Would like to try it with less players. Even though I'm sure it is the most epic in its 6 player form, I would like to try with 3-4 players to see how it goes. I've found that many games with long play times are often best played with less players.

RATING: 9
As with Through the Ages and other long games, I really don't care how long it takes so long as the gaming experience is compelling.  I would rate a 10 if the combat system had a little more meat.  It's fast to ensure that the battles don't dominate playing time, but I've played other combat systems that are just as quick but give more depth.  Fantasy Flight should have opted for some clever dice mechanic in place of tired old D10's and really spiced this game up!  Still, very fun times each time I've played.

It is difficult to rate the base set because I have not played it without the first expansion. It seems that the original ISC sucked and the objectives were too tame. (rating down by 2). Theme, replayability and depth is a big plus (rating up by 2), the length, turtling and leader bashing a big minus (rating down by 2). With the first expansion I would rate the game 7. With some house rules that discourage turtling I would rate the game 8.

Only played once and we did it in about 14 hours which is in our opinion a bit overexagarated. Though I like the massive variety of paths you can follow and the constant interaction. In my first opinion the action cards are too powerful in respect to the political cards, which have too little influence. Neither one of us was very interested in the political strategy or the trade strategy. 

A great negative point for such a big game are the dice, which can be decisive. I have to say that the winner was very bad at the rolling of the dice so will have to rejudge my opinion on the dice more times

3. Mammut
4. Merkator
5. Myrmes
6. Warhammer: Invasion


Small update:  14 point game is just too long.  Players have too much downtime, and the progression of points (at least in our game) were just too slow.  Granted, having the objectives 5 planets outside your system, 10, and 15, didn't help.


This game is an odd beast.  It has some thing in it that drive me nuts--brutal player elimination, unbalanced secret objectives, overly long gameplay, and very random combat.  Also, players who do not take the time or are polite enough to think about their move while others play, is just plain annoying.  However, everytime I play this game, I like it.  Played again this past weekend (5/25) and once again enjoyed it and got to try a new race.  This game is not perfect, but its fun.  I really want to try a 3 or 4 player game to see how it plays.

Races Played:

Saardak Nor x2 (loss, loss)
Yssaril Tribes x2 (win. loss came in 2nd)
The Federation of Sol (win)
The Winnu (loss, came in 2nd)

Variants Tried:

Age of Empires:  This give you more options for planning ahead, and certainly gives the game more flavor.  I think I slightly prefer the chaotic nature of not knowing the public objectives except each turn they are flipped.  Both are good.

Imperial II (new power cards):  These are good.  I really like the update to Imperial.  Having a power that everyone takes just because it is 2 VP is just sillly.  However, if you play with this and the other "tweaked" powers, you need to play with Age of Empires.

Artifacts:  Not a fan.  They seem placed just to create more conflict than anything.  I don't hate them, but I don't think it really added much to the game either.

Distant Suns:  I like this variant a lot.  I cannot see playing a game without it.

The game with something for everyone.  I think I'd even start to rate this higher if I could just get to play a game without one person at the table learning it.

RATING: 5
After one play, I'd say the game suffers from the same problem as a lot of these types of games -- the slooooooow build-up of forces and then the explosion of battle. The first half of the game was a crawl, and then things started to pick up. However, the dicefest nature of the battles means fights are slow and create a lot of downtime for the other players. I want to give TI3 another shot sometime soon, though.

Feb. 4, 2008 -- I finally got to play this a second time yesterday. I still haven't made up my mind about whether I like it or not, though, so my rating will remain the same. It seems like the public objectives are far too random. It would be nice to know what I should be doing to gain VPs. Instead, I feel like I'm floundering around waiting for a sign from the game as to what I should do. 6/10

March 22, 2008 -- Although we still slipped up on a few minor rules, we got the core rules down pat this time. This led to fewer rules arguments, less looking up of rules and a better game. For optional rules, we used the Shattered Empire strategy cards (with Bureaucracy), Distant Suns, Age of Empire and Caretakers of Mecatol Rex.

The addition of the Age of Empire option made the game much more enjoyable and allowed for more long-term planning. The public objectives ended up being very heavy on technology, so that made for a fairly tech-heavy game, I think.

While we had fun, the game took about six hours from start to finish, and the last hour seemed to drag on and on and on. I knew I was out of the running (from poor tactical decisions in the last few turns), and that's when everyone decided to go full throttle in terms of warfare, making for a very long turn with a lot of player downtime. In total, we had eight turns of gameplay before we moved the turn marker to Imperium Rex.

I'm still not fond of several elements of the game that I feel detract from my fun. Combat slows things down too much and creates too much downtime. The style of combat mechanic is one I'm not fond of. The pace of the game does rely a lot on the players, though. If they don't think about their moves ahead of time or are too slow to do things, TI3 can get really bogged down.

I'm not going to be in any hurry to play again, but if the owner of the game wants to get it on the table again in a few months, I'd probably join. No change in rating. 6/10

RATING: 8
This edition has great components and a great theme, but it suffers from the fact that it plays better in a group, but inevitably one or two players suffer from analysis paralysis, and so the game takes forever to finish.

There is less commitment and frustration in organizing an evening of role-playing than there is in trying to get a game in of Twilight Imperium.

Love this game! One of my top ten games! (NOTE: Yes, I did sell it! Not because my opinion of the game has changed, but because I hardly ever got it to the table and enough friends or people I know own it, that I get a chance to play it at least as often as I did when I owned it!)

I'm not sure if this is the right rating or not. This is after 2 plays. I really like this game for the most part. There is a lot going on, and I'm a sucker for epic games. This one may almost be too long though. I wouldn't consider buying this game for the fact that it would collect dust other than when I read through the rules every couple months wishing to play. If you get the chance to play it DO IT. It can be very tense and rewarding. But buying it is only realistic if you think you can get 6 people together for a 10 hour marathon more than once a year.

The victory conditions are slightly imbalanced, the game should end at the the end of a status phase when a player has the required victory points, not when a person reaches the amount. I like that at least two victory points are awarded per turn, and I believe that the compensation that the other players receive is adequate. Some of the action cards are imbalanced, just remove the offending cards.

Fun theme and mechanics, but the game play is too long and supports turtling.  My single game of this started at 9:00 PM and finished around 5:00 AM.  I'd play it again if someone really wanted to, but will usually look to play something else instead.

RATING: 8
After my third game of TI3, I upped my rating from 9 to 10. This is simply an outstanding game. The number of options available to the player, from combat to technological advances to diplomacy and negotiation, provide a wonderful variety of entertaining choices to make. The dynamic nature of the game setup as well as the sheer number of races and action/political cards make the replayability factor on this game very high. My only regret is that I cannot make enough time to play this game every week.

Note that I've only played it with Shattered Empire (incorporating various combinations of rules from that expansion, but never using the original ISC). In my opinion, Shattered Empire is a must-have. Nearly everything in it is an improvement.

Edit: I'm bumping this back down to a 9. I love the game, but its serious drawback is the difficulty new players have in picking it up. A game involving new players generally drags. If you have a regular group that can play on a semi-frequent basis, it's a 10. Otherwise, if people are having to constantly learn/relearn/remember the rules, it starts dragging.

Edit 2: Down to an 8 - family life intervenes. This does not get to the table frequently enough due to length and complexity. Sold.

What an epic game.  If it didn't take so long to play, it would certainly be regarded higher in the community.  When you are ready for a board-gaming Saga, sit down with this game and 5 friends (4 or 6 players are best).  So much going on, so many things to do and options to victory.  A perfect blend of political, economic and warfare mix to make this such a fulfilling game to play.  Strategy, diplomacy, surprise game-changing politics..  It's all in that huge box.  The Shattered Empires expansion is a must after playing it a few times in it's basic form.   Even if you lose, you will still have a great time being part of every aspect of this game!

RATING: 10
The game is massive and often takes six to eight hours to finish with four or five players. And. I. Love. It.

I've owned this game since 2006 and my copy has seen dozens of plays. I have the expansions. Nowadays we pull it out for a play too rarely, but that was expected when I and my friends chose this get-a-family-and-start-working-and-have-an-actual-life business. Still, when we play this game the experience is epic.

If you are looking for an epic strategy game with a multitude of ways and tactics to victory and have ample time to finish each play this is the game. Look no further. On the other hand, if you and your friends are not prepared to sit down for six to eight hours to finish each play, this game is probably not worth it for you.

Pros:
- Diplomacy. Oh sweet diplomacy. I might just have estranged my closest friend in real life but I just had to extort those three Trade Goods to finish that Dreadnought fleet. Onwards to victory!
- Changing and complex map. Why do I have to start next to two supernovae and you guys start next to a bunch of lush worlds filled with innocent seafaring unicorns?
- Rules to come out of your ears. Well, actually, the rules are not that bad to get down and it's relatively simple to get going but once you start to cheat with those Action Cards that break the regular rules you are in an endless swamp.
- Varied races. I shall play with the ruthless Space-Gollums, you play with those Furries that try to trade their way into victory. Sneers.
- Research. Develop your race and leave your petty roots behind. Where you once relied on tin cans and x-ray lasers now you hop around with slave wormhole generators and blast at enemies with antimatter bombs.

Cons:
- After the map for the play is generated you can see who will probably struggle and who will probably be a strong contender for victory. This can be a bad thing due to the lenght of each play. It's not very fun to play for eight hours when you know you probably won't be even close to winning.

Best Science Fiction space based epic euro game on the market PERIOD!!!  And the Shattered Empires and Shards of the Throne expansions to TI3 are awesome too!  Twilight Imperium 3 has it all - conquest of the galaxy, economics, politics, technology tree, moving target victory conditions, space battles, lots of unique alien races with starting special abilities, and a million different optional rules between the base game and the expansions to constantly change the dynamic of play and replayability.  This game scales well and can handle up to 6 players (8 players with the expansions) - although I usually prefer 6 around the table.  The galaxy uses hexagon tiles and has everything from planets to asteroids to worm holes to Ion Storms to Nebulas to Super Novas to many, many more tile types with the expansions.  The game pieces are cool molded plastic pieces.  The alien races are artistically tasteful, and with the expansions, there will almost always be different races in play in every game played.  TI3 can be a long super heavy euro style game taking anywhere from 5 to 14 hours to play.  I usually prefer to have players commit to an entire day starting in the mid morning, knowing that the game may be over in the afternoon or may go well into the evening.  There is also very little downtime in TI3 as players are constantly negotiating, cutting deals, threatening other players, voting on laws, planning their next move, reacting to other players primary action by taking the optional secondary action and oonstantly evaluating the target opportunities on the board for scoring victory points.  The combat involves rolling lots of 10 sided dice and most space battles are fought to the death.  Planetary invasions can follow as well.  This game is not for the feint hearted and should be played either after watching videos online or played with an experienced player at the table.  Lastly, this game has undergone constant development and change over the years to get to the polished level it is now at.  TI3 is one of my top 10 all time best games I enjoy playing!!!

RATING: 7
Astoundingly cool game suffering somewhat from a long play-time and much more from a myriad of rough spots which need (or benefit greatly) from filing down / houseruling: ISC, overpowered Fighters, underpowered Dreadnoughts, Microtech's badness, and more.

Situations can arise (both due to the board-building procedure and racial selections) where one player or another is in a notably better or worse position. [EDIT: This can be mitigated by using some partially-preset board arrangements, available online.] The imbalance can be easily compensated for via table dynamics, but the game is diverse enough that recognizing any but the most eggregious of such cases can take some experience...and getting that experience will take a while, as the game isn't fast. 

If you don't mind making lots of house-rule tweaks, your play-group is OK with keeping track of them, and you like games with ambiance, this is  fantastic.

But if you're looking for a beautiful masterpiece of mechanics, you're not going to find it here, and if you don't want to deal with house rules...well, it's not particularly well-tuned out-of-the-box. It's certainly playable, though, and possibly worth it just for the atmosphere, especially if your group enjoys in-character sabre-rattling. 

As others have said, this is [b]not[/b] a space wargame. It is a space opera game with warships. Very important distinction.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a big, complicated game.  Not for everyone.  Allot more than 6 hours for this game.  It looks like a wargame (and it is), but is more of a political game.  

Its kind of like "Axis and Allies" (plastic piece armies) meets classic "Civilization" (lead a civ to glory, buy technology) in space.  And winning is about having the most victory points, rather than eliminating other players.  Players can be eliminated though.

Has a bit of EuroGame influence in that people pick roles for every turn (reminiscent of Puerto Rico) and a hex map built by the players (reminiscent of Settlers of Catan), but is really a cut-throat Ameritrash game.  Lots of beautiful plastic ships, and dice rolling.

Original rulebook is like 40 pages, expansion rulebook is maybe 25 pages, and the FAQ is 10 pages.  So it is not simple.

This is a great game about sci-fi civilization. You get war, technology, colonizing, politics, everything you could think of. The gameplay also combination of Euro and AT, making it awesome. It's the best 4X (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate) boardgame to date. Simulates most of everything, there are no other words beside: EPIC! This what you get inside:

- (Lots of) Variable player power
- Many technologies to research, giving special abilities
- Although the ship models are same, but different technologies and race power can give a very different characteristics of gameplay
- Colonizing planet is one of the key to victory, but not always. Enough is the word.
- Diplomacy and negotiation CAN affect your victory.
- Role selection mechanics for determining phase of the game, but not strictly govern it.
- Neat mechanism about action points and movement in this game. 

The base game itself would rate about 2-3 (yes, really!) since it's so broken for 3+ hours game. But the expansions making it perfect. NEVER PLAY WITHOUT SHATTERED EMPIRE! Even in your 1st play. 

I repeat:
NEVER PLAY WITHOUT SHATTERED EMPIRE!
NEVER PLAY WITHOUT SHATTERED EMPIRE!
NEVER PLAY WITHOUT SHATTERED EMPIRE!
NEVER PLAY WITHOUT SHATTERED EMPIRE!

An overwrought, under-developed Frankenstein of a game that practically screams invitingly at adolescent males, yet completely fails to convey a sense of interstellar empire-building to anyone with a solid background in serious science fiction.  The rude proximity of the systems on the undersized map give the game a feeling of conflict in suburbia, rather than across hundreds of light years.  The system works, for the most part, but tries to be too many things to too many people, resulting only in being mediocre in all respects.

The game, without substantial modification, rewards turtling, which results in tedium and yawning in epic proportions, but little else.

Seldom have I seen in a game so much time spent by so many players, resulting in so very little.

Damn this game is so awesome. After the first trial with 4, I always play with 6 players. Politicking is the most interesting part of the game as you constantly have to make shaky alliances and temporary truces. Threats and bribes are common. Making good with your neighbors is essential as you can't go at it alone. Someone has to be at your back, because it's next to impossible to fight two wars at once. But be careful as only one person can win.

Played once so far. Rating may increase after another play.. it's really good, long but who cares.  Lots of decisions and various mechanics make it a winner in my book. Top quality components and some nasty political cards kept things even throughout the game.  I can't wait to play again.

No other game I've ever played is such an epic experience as TI. There is something about the way this game is designed that just makes it feel like an amazing adventure. Problem is - it's an adventure I'm very rarely able to emberk on due to the difficulty in gathering several people with enough time to kill.

RATING: 5
Played 3 times.  The length kills this game for me. It's simply hard to justify a 9-hour 6-player game of TI.  4-player takes less time (6-hours), and I think it's more interesting.  

More specific problems include: (1) the Imperium Rex card that ends the game needs a re-working; and (2) some beginning objectives are much easier than others.

In the game's defense, however, TI offers a very immersive experience.  It involves a lot of choices and a lot of meta-gaming, paying attention to your opponents, etc.

I picked this up for a $10 during one of Barnes and Noble's clearance sales. I spent hours separating and bagging all of the pieces. I was ready to give it a try at the second BGG.Con until someone pointed out that it would take up the bulk of one day of the con. I opted to follow the game while playing some others. The time estimate was optimistic - it took a lot longer that anyone thought and the game ended with a coin flip surrender, so that everyone could move on to other games. I don't have time to play long games that I [i]enjoy[/i], much less one that doesn't really look like I would enjoy it. Traded away in a math trade.

A very much improved version of Twilight Imperium from FFG. Better components, better rules... makes for a much better experience. Grand strategy informed by tactical considerations. I find it to be a great balance between limited choice planning and luck (dice and card-play). By balance I mean in favor of the planning, but with enough luck to influence play.

Fascinatic Ameritrash space epic! Incredibly long and sometimes seemingly broken in places, but the Universe is a cold, dark place and people who complain about unfairness quickly get launched out the airlock.

Not something for all occasions, but a satisfying and exhausting game that should at least get played once a year.

RATING: 10
A game I constantly am looking to play. The only problems that I have with this game are gamepace and choosing opponents.

Game pace: It is a long game, I don't mind because it flies by, but sometimes the pacing of the game gets bogged down because of a star battle or side conversations. I rate this game a 10 because the game doesn't do this the players do, but it still happens.

Choosing opponents: This game can go sour if you are playing with people who are not fun. I have played games of this where I felt like the life was being sucked out of the room because they don't converse, play rigidly, get angry when you back stab or even just attack them, etc. 

This game is in my opinion one of the greatest games. It is well balanced, has many game mechanics working together in a glorious fashion, many modules to add, wonderful plastic pieces, great looking board, wonderful player interactions, so so much packed into a nice large box! :-)

RATING: 6
The game length kills my desire to play.  I'm happy to game for six hours or more, but it's not much fun playing a single six hour game when you know two hours in that you are effectively down and out.

Because this game has a large ruleset and seldom hits the table, it feels like a chore to relearn all of the rules before every game.

Played quite a bit the first few months.. and lay dormant. Now doing a meetup every other month. This is joy! I realize that TI3's story is in the actions people choose to do.

I desperately want to like it due to all the effort put into learning the rules, and the theme and look is great. Unfortunately, in the end it doesn't feel much different from "Risk" on depressants. So far TI3 has been one huge disappointment, but given the investment I'll give it at least one more go before giving up. Update: half a dozen games under the belt now and my impression hasn't changed, although the rating keeps dropping. The game is far too random for my taste. First hour is spent setting up, second is spent building up. Third and fourth hour usually involves players sparing up to fight 1:1 in one single mega battle from which one emerges victorious and the other is essentially eliminated. The promise of strategic play just isn't there, or even tactical grabs for victory points, it's all just rather mundane. nb. I generally enjoy AmeriTrash and don't mind player elimination. I owned both TI3 and TI3:SE and have played several games with and without the expansion. Now traded away.

TI3 is an experience more than a game. Each game I've played has been engraved into my mind. Bold manouvers, sweeping tactics, last ditch attempts to grasp Mecatol Rex. TI3 is pure thematic bliss. The mechanics work very well together and forms one of the most epic games ever made. The extremely long play time is a negative since organizing a game of TI3 is almost as much of a challenge as playing it is.

TI3 was great to play at least once. The production quality was very good and were lucky enough to have someone playing who knew the rules very well.  The only thing I didn't care for was that the Ships  were very slow to move.  Understandable for a relatively small map, but I thought it limited strategy.  Maybe that is just my inexperience talking, though.  I am glad I got a chance to play, but it is too long for me to expect to play much again.

The game is too long.  But it can be an incredibly fun strategy AND social game.  As long as you take steps to decrease the length (play with a preset board, force time limits on player turns, allow players to take simultaneous turns, don't play with all possible extra content, keep good track of each player's tech, etc) you should be able to have a good time with this one.

But the 4 hours suggested on the box is a joke.  I can't imagine how even experienced players could find themselves done with a game in less than 5 hours.  Space combat die rolling alone takes forever....

Played it once and I am conflicted about this game. I am going to say it was enjoyable. However, I was expecting this amazing experience due to the fact, I was disappointed.

Will certainly play it again at some point and revise rating accordingly.

Copy paste of a ton of mechanics from Euros, but no attention paid to the pacing or if it all works together. 

This game is a beast, we played 2/3rds of a game and most of it was people just turtling their base. At the end the guy that chose the 2 AP role the most times won the game on VP. This game needs a streamline variant in the worst way. 

Components are excellent quality.

Played twice.  It was quite good.  Surprisingly good, actually.  I wanna play again.  I will say, that I'm not overly fond of the '8' action, adding the 'Puerto Rico-esque' element which means you need to pick either the '1' or the '8' 'cuz if you don't someone else will and they'll win because of it (at least for four players).  It's best with six, unfortunately.

First play, although incomplete, was very enjoyable! The replay factor is quite high in this game, as so many elements are randomized. Game is much more subtle than simply conquering the known galaxy, although that's an option! Looking forward to more plays soon!!!

Now, with five plays under my belt, including the first with the Shattered Empires expansion, I would maintain my high rating for this game. It can go on a little long, and it may not be perfectly balanced (from one race to another), but it still is a lot of fun and has a high replay factor. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
My favorite "All Day" (read: 8 hours or more) game that I've played.  It wouldn't be as enjoyable had Mr. Petersen not implimented the Euro mechanics in order to minimize the downtime.  I also like the Objectives, which are a necessary deviation from the typical Ameritrash game where you win by eliminating your opponent's units or taking territories.  Don't misunderstand me though, there is a lot of conflict in this game. It's just not the only way to win.  The game emphasizes diplomacy, technology, trading and the rest of the things that go along with empire-building.  There's A LOT of game here, but this should make for endless replayability.  The problem is that it takes an entire day to play and I've read it's best with 6 players.  Still, it's completely worth the time--what a great game!  Epic.

Update: This game is frustrating to me now. After 7 plays, I'm still horrible at it, and I think the issue is the restriction on only being able to claim an Objective (earn VPs) at the end of a turn. Too many times, one small thing has prevented me from completing that objective, and it's just too hard to recover from that. In a short game, this would be easy to accept, but not in a 6 hour game. I still like it, but it's turning sour on me. My gaming time is just too limited to make me as excited to spend an entire day playing just this game.

I don't mind not being good at a game or winning. I can still appreciate a game despite that. However, this game takes about an hour to both set up and discuss/debate which additional content (expansions) to use and which optional rules, etc. Even playing with experienced players, and there is some time delay due to rules referencing. While I love the theme and story behind the races, I am just reminded that this is a pure FFG game. It has the rules bloat, swingy action cards and political cards (less of an issue for me), and just too much chrome. 

All my plays included the Shattered Empire expansion at a minimum. Not interested in playing just the base game, based on recommendations against just that.

It's a great game that wouldn't be near as good without the story and theme. The art is phenomenal as are the miniature sculpts (unlike Eclipse). The gameplay is fun, yet flawed. As I stated above, I have a problem with the difficulty of fulfilling the objectives, which only lengthens the game. The restrictions on Retreat and building Space Docks are just bizarre. The clunkiness of the various techs is AP-inducing and difficult to remember all the benefits. Direct Hit Action Cards change the game too much. No one takes hits on their ships that can sustain damage any more, making that ability useless. Racial abilities are great, but some change the game so much, such as the Pirate race being able to steal trade goods. As a result, no one saves TGs in games where that race is in play. Despite the issues, the experience is incredible. I find 4 players to be my sweet spot. Choose a single role each round. Makes the game easier to get played, and in a shorter time without losing out on anything. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great space opera due to the unique alien special powers and wild politics cards and how there is a lot of space provided for negotiation and surprise reversals of fortune without feeling broken through action card play.

4X game that has a lot of area control and diplomacy as a result.

Great role selection cards with primary and secondary ability game mechanism. Seems like a couple of the role cards work together to create an imbalance which is later addressed in an expansion with alternate role cards.

Thrilling dice combat with both space and land battles.

Lots of rules and phases of play which results in a steep learning curve. Experienced players may be able to play this game in about an hour per player or less.

Modular game variants in base game give a lot of replayability to the game.

Lots of cool minis but it is a pain to cut the ships out of the plastic sheets.

This game is full of highs and lows and the highs are great but so much of it is just build up. And you can really fall behind early to the point of not being able to catch up. Then you're there for hours meaninglessly playing.

It's a good game but what you can for the time put in makes this overrated.

This is a very good civ game, the different player powers making things interesting. Has a smaller but similar problem to Imperial where warmongers can screw someone else out of VP by constantly attacking. A large number of rules, but they only take time to explain, once players grasp that most of the rules are defined by the text on everything and that they can only take 1 action a turn, things will go quickly. There can also be the "Australia problem" where players pile units onto one hex and sweep across the board. You can use your own style of play, but the objectives will often determine how your race develops.

RATING: 7
A fun, relatively simple multi-player version of Master of Orion done as a board game. After several plays I've had to drop my rating because, with the base game at least, there's a serious disconnect between warfare and victory conditions. The [i]Shattered Empires[/i] public objectives, as well as some of the alternate strategy tiles, are now IMO necessary to make the game interesting, and bring the game back up to an 8 or 9 rating. Another knock against the game is that newbies always get obsessed with building large fleets and attacking without any particular objective in mind. They just want to mix it up because, hey, big fleet!

The playing time can also be a problem, and it has caused me to avoid this game at gaming conventions because, between the rules explanations and general futzing you'll be lucky to reach turn 3. That being said, even a little experience goes a long way in reducing the playing time, probably more significantly than any other game I know.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Epic. I really like this game. It's like Masters of Orion on cardboard. A 4x game; eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate. It provides multiple races offering a diverse set of special abilities, a fascinating technology tree to explore, intriguing politics and diplomacy, and a big 'ol box-o-bits filled with Star Fighters, Dreadnoughts, and War Suns (Death Stars). 

I do have some issues with the game, but none that can't be addressed with a few house rules:

1) It's simply too difficult to get victory points...unless you take the ridiculously overpowered Imperial card each turn for 2 VPs. You could also choose the Bureaucracy card that lets the player choosing the card waste his turn to put out VP conditions that anyone can capitalize upon. I think a Victory Condition should just automatically reveal a card each turn, without the need of player activation. 

2) The game takes 6 hours. While some people would love it if the game lasted 3 times that long, many people would rather have a 3 hour game. I think the above rule suggestion would help resolve this, but the number of VPs required to win could also be reduced.

3) For a game that proportedly involves so much diplomacy, why is it not possible to agree to let a fellow player fly through your star system?!? Solution? Make it so!

Anyway, it's a great game, with a few flaws that can be overcome. It's got that 80's game feel that I love. Check it out.

game of epic epicness

RATING: 10
The following is my opinion.  I have played the game over 30 times.

This is the greatest board game that currently exists. However, to be specific, this is the greatest 4x/Civ/Hex/SciFi/War/Political board game that exists.

4x - Exploration. Extermination. Exploitation. Expand. This game encompasses all of it to the point where most compare this game to the iconic Masters of Orion on PC. In my opinion using the variant of unknown tiles/distant suns makes Exploration that much more rewarding (or painful). Extermination - War....War never changes. Exploitation - Politically or with planets - either way, create.  Expand - encompass the galaxy for VP or dominiation.

Thematically - Few games even come close thematically.  Every race has a deep backstory. This allows players to take on the role of the race, or, to learn more of the story of the overall universe - and just why is Mecatol Rex (in game) such a big deal.

Civilization - Every race is unique.  Every race has multiple abilities that seperate it from others.  It gives players a unique feeling/modifier.  There's a reason you're playing that race.  There are advantages and disadvantages to it.  It's awesome.  Additional unique techs/ship are available in the expansions.

Politics - There is a round for politics.  Players vote for laws that modifiy the entire game.  Or they vote on negative/positive one time effects on players/the universe as a whole.  Political maneuvering, back stabbing, alliances, all share a new form of beauty in this round.  While not everyone enjoys politics, at least in a board game, you can appreciate it.

SciFi - Not much outside of Star Wars Rebellion or Star Trek Ascendancy come close to the deep SciFi elements of the game.  

Hex - Modular based on players.  You and the other players take turns CREATING the univers. Or you can just randomize the tiles.  Either way, it has unique methods of making every game feel new.

War - Dice based combat.  Techs to upgrade ships/combat modifiers.  Quick tactics cards to allow players to swing a battle.  While the combat phase tends to be one of the longest, it is also a lot of fun.  However, there are some small issue that people have with RNC - I understand, but good luck trying to figure out a better method than what is in this game.

I've gone on far more than I expected - this game has more.  So much more.  I haven't played every variance. I haven't played every card.  Rules are complex. the GAME is COMPLEX.  The weight is a 5/5.  

Have fun.  Know that the game will be 5+hrs with 4 or more people.  I've only ever done a few 3 players games in under 5 hours.  

This game truly is amazing.  Highly replayable. Extremely fun. Intense. Strategic.  Litterally every positive adjective.

This is a serious, serious undertaking. I cannot emphasise that enough. Huge game. Huge complexity. And a huge scope for awesome gaming. The combat is really enjoyable. If you like trade, creating evil policies, asset management and sending a massive forces of ships out into the galaxy to kick ass, this is for you.

I had higher hopes for TI4, and actually might prefer TI3 with some house rules. While TI4 definitely speeds up the game, it also takes away some of the nuance and need for battle. Resources and trade goods flow a lot easier in the update, meaning you don't really have to go take too many planets. It reminded me more of Scythe in that you just try to stay in your little corner of the galaxy and do your thing. And a lot of the objectives re-enforce that by mearly saying... get 10 of these, or that. 

Games like Blood Rage and Kemet accomplish the objective/war/negotiation game much more effectively.

[October 2015 - 8.7]
Twilight Imperium is a tough game to rank. Its length of play (our games have averaged about 8 hours) is a handicap for sure ... but, if you're prepared for it, and only playing a few times a year, then it's a really fun experience.  

My best praise for the game (with its expansions) is that despite the length, after countless hours, everyone can still be in the game. I've played other board games that last about 3-4 hours, and after the first hour, a player can effectively be out of the game and forced to suffer another 2-3 hours. An eight-hour game that everyone is in it is better than a four-hour game that some are not.

Still ... eight hours is a trek and I think there's potential to streamline the game. Some of the expansions help, but in other areas just lengthen things. I find the political process, especially with all the ambassadors, spies and bodyguards a bit of a time suck and laborious. And moving your fleet takes forever. That being said, there is a beauty in the slow build-up and moving around the board. It's the anesthetist of the immediate-gratification generation and gives me that same frustration-love feeling as Few Acres of Snow, where it takes time to build up that perfect force and then move.

My biggest complaint about the game is some of the random elements like the distant suns and relics, etc.  I think the die rolling is enough randomness for me. 

I also find the Speaker token/order a bit uneven. Whoever starts out with it will always be in relative good shape, because the player to his left (who could take it and have the first player now be last) will likely never try to take it, being happy with second choice in the choosing of strategy cards. Meanwhile, the player in last turn has every incentive to take the speaker token, but if he/she does so, then the previous first player now just moves to second. To solve this, I would have the turn direction (for strategic card choice) to rotate back and forth between clockwise and counter-clockwise every time speaker token exchanges hands.

Finally, in teaching this game to people, don't bog down on the details.  Focus on how you score points, how you, build, how you move and how you take planets/battle.

Twilight Imperium (TI) has a lot of thinks to like. There is the control counter mechanism. I do like that the players turns are broken up into little actions. I don't even want to imagine the downtime, if everyone would do all their actions one after another. (Not that there isn't any downtime in TI as it is.) 
I think the public objective cards are a great mechanism.
But despite of all the thinks to like, I can't rate this game any higher. It is just too long and fiddly. I don't want to invest four to five hours into a game these days. And I don't want to remember all these little rule breaking tricks other players can do because of their tech-updates. TI just isn't a game for me.

Wish it could hit the table more often, always have a blast playing.  Have had a 6 player game go for about 8.5 hours but honestly it felt like time flew by.

It's in space, so it gets an automatic +1. I enjoy playing it, and some of the ideas and mechanics are well done, but for me at least it feels too much like a tabletop war-game, it usually takes far too long (6+ hours is typical), takes too long (the night before!) to set up, and it feels too unfinished. A card for every planet you own, action you take, and technology you develop seems too cumbersome, when there must be plenty of other simpler ways to represent game state (c.f. Eclipse). Great theme and great quality bits though, as one expects from Fantasy Flight.

This is the grandest empire building game ever made in my book. Sure it's long and it's complicated, but with 6 players it's simply awesome. No, let me rephrase that, it's FRIGGING AWESOME!

There's always things to do, plans to make, deals to be broken and friends to be backstabbed. No cuddling around, no protection of the weak, just plain old school 4X.

The best move in this game is to do nothing but build up.  Amazingly, companies still come out wargames that reward turtling.  That's the #1 issue that needs to be resolved in any wargame IMO.  I give TI2 a 4, but TI3 gets a 3 because of the repeated mistake.

RATING: 6
Talk about information overload. The game system itself isn't too complex and, although it is quite odd to be going around the universe unsure of how to score points until the cards come out, it is not uninteresting. On the other hand, once all the tech start coming out, with all the different action cards and possible political rules, it can get very information heavy very quickly. Probably once one is used to playing does the information overload starts going down, but it is quite a steep hill to climb.

Enjoyed very much when I owned it, but had a few problems with the game, one of which was it just never got played due to lack of time and  opponents.  Would love to get again with all of the expansions(which fixed most of the issues I had with the game) just because the game is so fun to play.

Idea:
Galactic war/diplomacy and politics/resourcemanagement.

Mechanism:
First create map from pile of hex tiles to create new galaxy each time. Also 17 playable races to make each game different.
Played action at a time until all pass. Before round each choose strategy card from common pool in order that give certain boni. Reveal victory conditions and try to fulfil them. Voted political laws change rules of game.

To whom 
If you like long strategygame (8h) that relies to dierolls too. Base rules have some bad design flaws (to my taste but some dont think that way) but are easily repaired by houserules. If you own copy you can play it PBeM too. Similarity to compugame: Master of Orion, if you liked that this is your game.

The longest board game I've ever played, and one of the most satisfying. I've powered through it twice as of this writing, once with just the base game and one with some expansion material (and eight players). 

It's a game that revels in its own excess, and you must be on that page in order to enjoy it. I also recommend playing with people you know, and people you know you like to play with. Because you will be with them for 6-12 hours, and their behavior will affect how much you enjoy this gargantuan game.

I wish I liked this one more, but there are a few things that I get hung up on.  One is the length, the game feels a bit bloated.  Two is that the recent edition is an amalgam of borrowed mechanics.   Three is the Imperial and Speaker cards.   I wish that Imperial gave you points for assaulting instead of functioning as a game timer.   It's very easy to score loads of points in this game by doing nothing other than staying home and building.  I love the idea of this game, but it just doesn't work.  (I hear the expansion helps a lot, although I still have to believe it's painfully slow).

The whole Imperial Strategy Card concept was horribly broken, one of those "how did THIS get past playtesting" things.  Just check out all the threads here on the 'Geek either bitching about it or suggesting ways to fix it.

There were lots of very interesting mechanisms in the game, but the ridiculous time investment was NEVER worth the trouble for us.  We'd play 4-5 hours and still never get a game finished.  A classic "too long for what it is" game.

I usually list TI as my favorite game when people ask.  There are others I might rate higher, and due to the length it's not something I feel like playing all the time, but it still tops my list.  I love big 4X space games, and jumped at the chance to learn this, way back when.  FFG has done an amazing job condensing the genre into board game form.  Long and complicated though it may seem, it's actually pretty simple.  You can do this many actions, consisting of these steps.  At the beginning of the round, you pick a specialization that will benefit your race.  Techs give you bonuses and let you break the rules, trade agreements give you cash, and laws impose new rules on the game.

The first thing you have to learn about the game is that only 2 things matter: points, and keeping control of your homeworld (so you can score points).  This also leads to one of the problems with the base version of the game.  
It comes with the Imperial strategy card, which scores 2 points (a fifth of what you need to win) for the holder.  This means that there's a lot less choice in strategy cards than it first appears.  You have to take the imperial card or, if the player to your right is start player, the initiative card in order to get it next turn.  This is by design, a clock that keeps the game moving.  However, there are some serious unintended consequences.  If you get randomly chosen as start player, you get your shot at the points first, when nobody else can really mess with you.  The game will last around 7 turns (give or take), so you'll probably get a second bite at the imperial card, while the person to your left might get one.  This means that the single most important die roll of the game is the very first one, determining start player.  
Worse still, there are action cards in the deck that mess with this progression - either banning someone from taking a strategy card or letting you hold one for 2 consecutive turns - and having one come out at the wrong time can be a major swing.   
Now, there are variants even in the base game rules that will mitigate this.  Reducing imperial to a single point doesn't eliminate the problem, but lessens it a lot.

This variability is one of the game's greatest strengths.  If you don't like an aspect of it, there's almost certainly a variant (official or otherwise) that addresses your concern.  For some reason, this game really sparks peoples' creativity, and you'll find plenty of customized races, strategy cards, systems, etc.  Our group regularly plays with a custom strategy card set nowadays.  

Turtling can be kind of an issue, as most of the public objectives in the game don't require conflict, just accumulating resources and techs.  This is partially mitigated by the secret objectives, which nearly all require you to take territory from someone or contest the central planet (Mecatol Rex).  But you can have games which are all buildup, and then a series of furious space battles in the late game that decide the victor.

The whole experience of the game is about as good as it gets.  You'll begin as a fledgling empire, grow & expand, make deals or come into conflict with your neighbors.  You might make a play for Mecatol Rex, or try and take over a foe's territory, or just sit and defend.  You'll have to decide whether to invest resources in your space fleet or R&D.  Wheel and deal with the other powers to get the juiciest trade contracts and avoid having laws pass that hinder your efforts.  There are so many possibilities, so many cards and planets.  If you can cordon off a chunk of time to play this, it will definitely leave an impression.

Impressive components, very thematic game.  TI3 fixes a few things from TI2 (such as components, PDS/fighter/ground force cost, makes Mecatol Rex more important, technology less expensive, more balanced trading, better objectives for victory—although the objectives need some tweaks, such as more combat-oriented ones).   But it leaves much untouched which needed changing, such as very sluggish/static play, excessive game length, often irrelevant political cards, unbalanced map and technologies, and no formal alliance system (except the diplomacy strategy card).  The new rules for command counters/limited activations and strategy cards are interesting and make the game seem new, but increase the analysis/planning in the game and increase the energy and dedication needed to play, and thus restricts the playing opportunities further.  I question the more-detailed combat units in a game that doesn’t really encourage a lot of combat.  A playtested variant should have been included for a simpler, quicker conquest game.

I finally got my hands of the actual game and we have played 2 4-player and 1 6-player games since. FFG has made a masterpiece here. Normally, I would knock off a point for the playing time but in this case, it is actually a good thing. I could not imagine playing this game in 2-3 hours only. There is nothing wrong in this game and it is scalable with optional rules if your desire more or less luck/playing time. A lot of discussions have happened aroung the 2 pts. ISC but in our 3 games so far, this was not a problem at all. Call me a fanboy. This to me is a classic and well deserves my rating of 10.

The ultimate game in my collection, which I abandoned because it was too difficult to move from place to place so I left her with my gaming group in my hometown.
It is the heaviest game I played, full of intrigue, drama, thrill, role play and a whole bunch of exceptions and house rules.
I think it is the mother of all space opera games. The setting and the lore are beautiful, although borrowed from every space themed classic you love.
I love the way every race is conceptually totally different, and I love modular hexagonal space board which offers so much replayability.
But great stuff oft come with dire consequences. The game is too heavy and so immensely long. It is impossible to finish a game in less than 6 hours. Setting up and cleaning up alone take almost 1 hour. We always include one meal order in one session of TI.
Besides that, there are quite a few imbalancing and limiting factors in the basic rules which are easily avoided with two awesome must-have expansions.

This game is interesting but, every attempt at playing it even with it's expansion has resulted in games that were so lengthy that we generally do not play it anymore simply for that reason. It takes far too long to play.

Ahh, what a game.  Long and compelling.  Not a game you drop on a group at the last minute, a game that you plan to play weeks in advance.  And worth it.

Space battles, missions, area control, tactics, and politics.  If you want a game to sink your teeth (and an evening) into, this is it.

If you can get a TI3 group together, all the better.

A wonderful fusion of old school and euro school gaming.  I'd give this a 10 if it wasn't for the fact that some of the variant rules probably should be used to tweak the game experience a little more.  I'd think that if a 4th edition comes out then it would be perfect.

RATING: 9
For those of you liking long (say epic), complex, space/scifi strategy games with the unknown element (you can't predict everything in real war, huh?), this is probably the game for you. The manual boasts 44 pages, and it'll take probably 
an hour or so to explain the rules for new players.

I haven't actually played the game yet, but I'm eagerly looking towards my first game, it seems I'm lucky to have at least five players in the first session - all of them equally unfamiliar with the game, so it should be interesting. I hope I'll get to play as Xxcha, Federation of Sol (yay! that means us) or Hylars..

RATING: 9
I don't even know where to begin. This game is MASSIVE and the experience it provides is second to none. The slow build-up makes it hard to lose ships on battles because you grow attached to them, and the slow expansion makes it feel like you are working your ass off to achieve things. I have only played once and to boot, I won the game with the Hacan! 

Too bad this plays for so long hours and hence it will hardly see the table, but that feel you can only get from a game that lasts this long. I played a 6-player game and the only not so good thing to me was that we were all focusing too much on the players on our sides. I understand that's our problem and the way we played, but you are practically left with that option only if you want to do a bit of everything, unless you focus on techs all the time. I also wish that the Political phase was a bit more prominent because it leads to important decisions. Would love to play this game at least once a year. Fantastic.

First impressions are good: I really enjoyed this big, sprawling game of galactic conquest but I can't imagine ever buying this one because I'm just not sure how often it would get to the table. I already own several "event games" like Descent and Arkham Horror and I already don't play those as often as I'd like.

If FFG does what they seem to be doing with their other franchises and make a streamlined version (like Arkham -> Eldritch Horror or Descent -> D 2nd Ed) I would be really interested.

Gawd, who talked me into playing this garbage. Thought it was something of a 4x game, but in the end the whole game was an excuse to race to 14 points where basically to win each player had to accomplish almost identical goals (so much for alternate paths of victory). Battles were a repetitious thing were each player and his immediate neighbors refought over a bordering region.

So much tedious work for sooo little payoff.

This is a great game for the 4x space game crowd.  I can see why so many people like it.  Great theme, great balance.  I got out of it some of thing things I really wanted to get out of Cosmic Encounter.  Sill, it isn't a euro-game, and I stick mostly to euro-games for a reason.  I don't have the 8 hours to spend on games anymore.  I wish I did.  I'd be much more into this were that the case.

RATING: 1
Cool bits, but the game is super lopsided.  Lots of awesome stuff tossed together feels haphazard.  In so many games, it just doesn't seem like the ships are even relevant to anything, victory points come so quick, the game typically ends by the time the first real combat would begin.  Maybe if the game went to 15 points it would be better, make people work to survive the fighting at least a little.

RATING: 7
While not my buddy Tim's favorite, both my buddy Rich and I thoroughly enjoyed this epice space game.  I'm not going to say that the game does not have faults because it clearly does.  The importance of being able to continue to choose the role that gives you a victory point should not be able to be messed with using cards and the fact that my buddy Tim won because of a lucky draw at the end in technology, did seem a bit off.  However, with the variant rules, I think this game has the opportunity to be really something amazing to play.

RATING: 4
As an attempt to design a "Master of Orion"-style boardgame, I would give this game a 10 for ambition and effort. However, perhaps the ambition was too great, as TI3 fails to deliver on gameplay. The production quality and detail are great and others have waxed lyrical on them but they don't save the game completely. The glacial and unengaging game play, particularly in the time it takes to build up a fleet may appeal to RTS players grown on a diet of Command & Conquer, Warcraft etc, but is unacceptable in a boardgame. It takes so long for anything to get done that players simply lose interest halfway through the game. Teething problems will ensure that there will be a TI:4, and 5, and 6....

It took us three hours for setup and to figure out how to do the first round, then we got down to two hours for the second round, then 90 minutes, and finally down to an hour per round.  The entire first game took us 6 rounds and 10.5 hours!  Two of our five players dropped out from exhaustion, but the rest of continued and finished. Overall, four of our five said, "Definitely would play again," especially now that we know how the rules work!

I played about 10 times and game is starting to show some cracks on the surface.
I see two problems with this game: playtime and required number of players (5+). It is just so hard to arrange Twilight Imperium session these days.

One can hope 4th edition will deal with these issues.

Otherwise it is still great game, and one of my favourites.

Edit: Finally found devoted group of players to play this monster of a game regularly. Two plays this month alone! Still a solid 7 for this game - clumsy, long and bloated, yet epic, fun and dripping with fantastic space opera theme.

When oh When will I get this to the table, oh woe is me

Update, finally got this to the table, and its great, I can imaghine that it gets to be a long long game with more players, but it is engrossing and well worth the effort.

Update - played a 5 player game now and with mostly new player we were at the table for 7 hrs, the game is good, but seems to take a long time to do useful stuff. Wish there were more ways to score victory pts so you could have a choice as to what to go for, my secret objective was virtually impossible to get.

Snagged for $47 (free shipping) on Amazon in December, 2011.  Best price I've ever seen for it.  Fantastic game.  Amazing bits.  Yes, it's fiddly but that's part of the charm.  Incredible amount of choice in the game but I never felt inundated with too much.  Different setup in tiles, races, and objective choices makes for a different game each time.  It is epic in scope, feel, and the length of time required to play - but it is so worth it.

- Hidden Quest
- Asymmetrical starting races
- Political phase

RATING: 6
That the game takes so long to complete is daunting.  Political facet also scares me as i don't generally like politics and negotiation in games.  That it's scifi tho, strongly pulls me in.  I'll have to at least play a full game or two in my lifetime before a final judgment.

6 plays: well i think i've reached my limit.  After trying everything humanly possible to shorten the playtime, the game length is still wholly unacceptable.  I also don't like wargames and this turns out to be mostly one.

Waiting for a chance to play it with my friends.

Updated 2012-02-03: I played a game of TI3 last fall with mixed feelings. The game looks really good (It's a FFG game) and captures the feeling of epic space game, but the long set up and playing time didn't convinced me yet if TI3 is worth it or not. Need to play it more to get to know its benefits and flaws better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is an involved game. It takes a lot of commitment from players to get through a whole game, but it is not really that complicated. However, I find that I am not a very big fan of everyone having individual goals and the abundance of cards in a game this long. It is similar to Merchants and Marauders in that respect; it just takes some getting used to probably.
-
Rating lowered from 8 to 7 after playing TI4. I have learned that both TI3 and 4 are not completely to my tastes because they take too long, can have players fall out of contention, and can come down to a very small mistake.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Better than all previous editions, but it suffers from one problem, no system to govern enlightened self-interest. Alliance systems like those in Dune and Struggle of Empires allow for players to expand and fight without needing to conquer all before them. This makes TI3 unnecessarily long.

The random draw for the board tiles make the game uneven, somebody gets unfairly hosed.

I'll play occasionally...

Truly an epic with everything great in a game-- alliances, political back-stabbing, technology development and of course space battles.

I don't mind playing this game, but by the time people start hitting the 6-8vp point, I'm just dying to get it over with. Can't imagine playing with the Imperium card only worth one, but have heard there's some sort of variant that flips more public objectives with that (was it one per turn?). So I guess the A.D.D. part of me doesn't like to play, yet I still wind up doing so once or twice a year.

Writing about Twilight Imperium while trying to be synthetic is really hard.
It is a Huge game, in many ways.
It requires a huge amount of time to be played, a huge number (6 is huge for my gaming group) of hugely experienced and "devoted" gamers in order to be played optimally (and a huge amount of tablespace).
It has a huge number of flaws rules-wise and balance-wise.
But it has tons of flavour in it, and one can enjoy it immensely in the right situation.
It gives the player an incredible degree of freedom in managing its empire, and provides an exciting amount of interaction with the whole table.
Unfortunately, I was able to play it satisfyingly only a couple of times, so as of now for me it is still a big unfullfilled promise.
If you can meet all the requirments, it is an unparalleled game.
I'm still waiting for all the stars to align in order to have my chance to play TI at its finest.
Until then, rating is an 8 for its potential.


After having many more plays under my belt, all I can say is I still feel like there is something I cannot grasp.
Ii is a great game, has an epic feel but it's very very hard to play it regularly and gives me the strong impression that there is a lot of potential that hasn't been fully exploited.

If I had to rate it just considering how much I enjoy playing it, I would rate TI a 10, but considering its "weight" and (minor) imperfections, I think 8.5 is more appropriate.

Considering the weight of the game and its far-from-perfect balancing, it goes down to a 7 for me.

I used to think this game was the greatest thing ever.  But the more I started playing games that took less time, were more developed and balanced, and not-so-darn fiddly, I began to hate it more and more.  Now everytime I think about just the set-up time of this klunker it irritates me.  In my mind, it is the king of Ameritrash games.  If that's what you like, fine, but please don't ask me to play it with you.

5/31/2012: No change in rating.  I just wanted to continue to rant about how much I do NOT like playing this game.  That is all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I appreciate the complexity of this game, but it also has many nuances that I feel will always leave bad tastes in my mouth for a game that requires this much time and energy. For the most part I wasn't a big fan of the victory point goals, the bland stats assigned to ships for god-awful dice combat, the ridiculous swinginess of the action cards, and the confusing slog that assigning/distributing combat commands create each round (yes, pretty much the whole game. It's not necessarily for me, but I DID like it and want to play again).

However, the universe that was created here is so epic and beautiful and demands to be played and experienced. The races felt unique. I enjoyed setting up the universe at the beginning of the game, and given the opportunity I really think I'd have fun trying some different approaches with the Tech Tree. There's a lot of fun game here to play with, but it's just a shame its so hard to get actual playtime out of it and so much of your effort planning out turns can be destroyed by someone else getting lucky card draws and/or die rolls.

The game itself is ok. The components are fantastic, and the basic mechanics are fine, but for some reason the game just doesn't click... it drags on and on. Down time is massive and most games quickly turn into a stalemate... and whomever attacks first looses, as does the person they attack, since their forces are depleted, anyone else can swoop in for the kill.

The time spent on this game is not completely wasted but in comparison with what could have been played in the same amount of time, it is very hard not to be disappointed.  The role choosing mechanism is a nice touch until you realize that the #1 and #2 are always the same.  The different player power are not evenly balanced.  I can understand however that other players might like it; we spent a lot of effort coming up with possible fixes and tried a variety of house rules.  In the end I'm pretty sure that there may be a game under the chrome yet, I'm just not in the mood to fix a game especially if I have to shell out as much dough for such a big box.  Hello?  Who has the shelf space for such behemoths nowadays?!?

I enjoy this even more everytime I get to play it.  This game has become one of the favorites in my collection - enjoyed by everyone in the family.  I usually play with the "Age of Empire" options regarding ISC card.  I find the 2-player game lasts about 2 hours, the 3 player game goes for 3 hours.  It takes 4 hours when I'm teaching the game for 3 players.

This game gets played a lot within our family.  It's my wife's favorite game.

The expansions are all very cool.

Check out my tutorial/walk-through at http://www.preeminent.org/steve/games/ti3/ti3demo/

I think one of the reasons I give this game such high marks is that it's a "sandbox".  There are no real boundaries or path set to how you should play the game.  Yes there are certain logical things to do when you begin the game because you need economic strength, but this game as a high level of freedom.  Even with the longer game length this requires, it still gets a lot of replay ability.

RATING: N/A
On paper, this should be my favorite game of all time.  My one play was with four other rookies, and I'm guessing we were half to two-thirds done with no end in sight before we called it.  Everyone was exhausted and brain-fried, and at least one person had no desire to play again.  Also, many of us wished there had been more political activity.

Still, I haven't given up on it. I like the idea of the preset maps on the FFG website, and there are some variants in both the main rulebook and the expansion (Age Of Empire, Imperial II strategy card, and simulated early turns, for example) that I wish we had used in our game.  In fact, the expansion looks like it addresses nearly every issue I have with the game, so who knows.

EDIT: I have a friend who owns Eclipse now, so I may never play TI3 again.

RATING: 7.5
Pros
-lots of strategic options available every time/turn
-tactical timing is immensely important
-very detailed and good variety of game play elements
-lots of components, high quality components (but somewhat pricey)
-promotes aggressive play (as opposed to turtling)
-lots of variants including in book
-social game, lots of negotiation, politics etc
-players need to be involved at all times

Cons
-difficult to learn initially, information overload, hard to analyze what options to take during game play
-long game (I can't find anyone to play!), setup also takes fairly long
-lots of pieces, fiddly and very spacious (takes lots of table space)
-not a fan of some of the strategy card (but expansions remedy this)
-possible king making or ganging up (esp on player in the lead), may be unfair and ruin the experience for that player
-political system seems a tad weaker than expected
-dice based combat can be frustrating
-downtime between actions may be very high (i.e. combats you're not involved in)
-requires minimum 3+ players, ideally more
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It is a FANTASTIC game.  However, I rated it so low simply because TI3 isn't a game, it's a lifestyle.  Blocking out a day to play just isn't all that possible too often, and when it is we start to lose steam around hour 5.  I play Descent and Imperial Assault less often nowadays because of the setup time, so it should be clear that Twilight Imperium hasn't come out of the box in years.  In fact, it has recently been relegated to the storage unit.  Not getting rid of it, its a game to keep forever, but I don't foresee playing it more often than once every few years.

Twilight Imperium is not a game for everyone, and for a whole host of usually good reasons. However, for those willing to stick it out and roll with the chaotic, errata-ed, and FAQed rules across the base game and its two major expansions, Twilight Imperium is a beautiful chaotic wonderful mess of a game.

This rating would be a nine as I think this is a great game; but out of the box it isn't because you really do have to deal with the ISC issue (see forum).  The atmosphere is intense, the whole construction of the elements of this game leave every player with crucial decisions as the game tempo changes.  I just wish it didn't take so long to play.

RATING: 8
I played my faction wrong but still enjoyed the game. This is a long game and that should be considered before sitting down to it. If you enjoy in depth war games with goals and changing roles this is a game for you. I enjoyed the San Juan style jobs which were selected by a revolving first player and then the remaining jobs were passed to the next player. Each job gave different bonuses and along with planetary resources allowed you to perform specific actions for that round. Unpicked actions were not played. The type of action was also assigned a value and more valuable jobs went later in the rotation for the round. This is a complex game with several rules and I had to ask about specific rules several times.

RATING: 7.8
Vale cada minuto. No jogo cada um comanda uma raça interestelar que tenta construir um império galáctico. O jogo tem muitas peças, muitas regras, muitas estratégias mas passa longe de ser um jogo difícil. É pesado, sem dúvida, mas não é difícil. A mecânica do jogo é basicamente escolha de ações primárias, realizadas pelos jogadores que a escolheram, e ações secundárias, permitas somente para os outros jogadores. Intercalando com essas ações os jogadores tomam outras decisões como, movimentar, atacar e/ou produzir. Inicialmente ocorre uma corrida por setores e planetas vazios, desenvolvimento tecnológico e formação de frotas. Depois quando os jogadores se encontram nos mesmos setores ocorrem as batalhas. O jogo também tem uma parcela de conflitos decorrentes das questões comerciais e políticas. A resolução das batalhas é feita de acordo com as os números que saírem na rolagem dos dados (D10). As unidades têm características diferentes como, por exemplo, custo, velocidade, capacidade e o número mínimo nos dados para causar danos as naves inimigas. As tecnologias e habilidades das raças melhoram ou pioram essas características. Os objetivos, secretos e/ou abertos, ditam o progresso do jogo e as estratégias dos jogadores.O fato é que o jogo é bem envolvente e cativante. Vale cada minuto. Infelizmente o tempo e o peso dele faz com que seja um jogo para jogadores experientes (gamers). Isso diminui as oportunidades para jogá-lo.

I haven't played enough to formulate a solid opinion as of yet, but...
I really like the game so far, and feel it was definately worth the money, but there are a few issues that detract a little from the experience. There is not as much focus on the diplomacy and political aspects of the game as i would like, and the trade system is fairly poor, imo. I have't quite decided on the ISC yet, i'll give it a few more games. The fact that a game that takes as long as TI hit the table three times in one week however, shows how great i find it, despite its flaws.

Grade set after one 75% complete 5p game lasting 12 hours. Takes forever but no mechanic feels removable. Wouldnt be the space opera it is wo them. The science part, trade mechanic and the lack of barriers makes it a clear winner over Eclipse. Assume you need to learn rules/cards/mechanics more to appriciate it to its fullest. In what it covers it seems nothing comes close.

No matter how much I like the theme and how many times I played it, I cannot get past it's problems:
- Too long, and when I say that I don't complain about the actual time. I just have the impression that the game is crawling.
- No good reason to fight and usually no good outcome either, unless you completely overwhelm your opponent, therefore turtling is a very good strategy.
- Stupid Initiative-Imperial combo.

I walk away from the game feeling tired, not satisfied, so that's why I will avoid it in the future.

One of my favorite games to play if I can ever find the time and the willing participants. There is so much variety included in this game and its expansions... no two games play alike. The only reason I give it a 9 instead of a 10 has to do with the game's complexity; there are so many facets to this game, and a few of them aren't explained [i]quite[/i] well enough in the rules, and some improvisation is required. However, I would not hesitate to recommend this game to any lover of sci-fi/space operas and fun experiences.

Technically not owned, but a friend's copy lives at our house, because he'd never play it anywhere else. This is one of my absolute favorite games, and gets more interesting each time we play. It'd probably be a "10" if it wasn't for the fact that I think going for victory points to win is much less interesting than having discrete player objectives--but that's what houserules are for.

RATING: 7
Played it several times with two different groups. And the gamed was played total different in the two groups. 
Group one. (5-6 players). TIE3 should have been our upgrade from Axis & Allies, wich we have been playing for several years. Played it 4 times with an average playing time of 14 hours, in these games there have been a lot of turtling, early player elimination and  of course a lot of down time. After the 4. play noone would ever play this again. Rating 5

Group two. (3-4 players). Mostly have been playing eurogames. The incredible components made this group really want to try this, and it have been fun. 3-4 hours playing time, lots of smaller fights all over the universe and together with diplomacy, trade and politics, its fun. But in the end its still a race for VP´s.  

Rating 8

So what i am trying to say is, that I think TIE3 need the right group to be a fun game.

High learning curve bars entry, but highly engaging, strategic, and variable game play will make people clam mer for more.

Great mechanics. I sure love that technology tree, implemented with a technology card deck for each player. Unfortunately, developing a beautiful technology for your armed forces has little impact on the victory point conditions, which are largely based on which type of planet you own. Why even bother? If you have the strongest military in the galaxy, you'll probably lose to some stupid victory point cards that have nothing to do with military strength. Revamp the victory point cards or do away with them; then this will be a FUN military game.

RATING: 7
This game is great for it's epic scale and cool bits and number of interesting and interweaving mechanics, but those positives  also cause it's one major negative--this game takes a very long time to play.  Just working through each turn can take a very long time and the game can easily go up to 5 hours.  That is why the VP mechanic and the relatively low scoring victory point total are necessary--to make sure the game ends in a reasonable amount of time.  However, the VP kind of undercuts the epicness of the game by making it end at the point when "its just starting to get good".  It's a hard thing to balance, I mean you want the game to end in a reasonable amount of time (and 5 hours is reasonable) but at the same time you don't want it to just cut out in the middle of the action.  Finally, the game needs enough players to make it interesting (3 player is not much fun).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Stunning, epic, space conquest!  It is the kind of game that becomes an event unlike anything else.  You plan for the block of time and the players knowing it is going to be an memorable experience.  This is simply an amazing work of game design.  It has such an immersive narrative that develops throughout that can only happen in a game of this size, length, and scope.  It does have a learning curve, but 90% can be grasped rather quickly if you have played games with similar mechanics before.  Just an awesome way to spend a Saturday afternoon with a group of friends with no distractions.  Can;t wait until I can play this again!

RATING: 6
Twilight Imperium is quite an interesting game. It feels very much like Axis & Allies in space, but with several other modules running the show and a Puerto Rico-like actions selection mechanic that I like. I think what is most impressive about TI3 is the ease of play. I don't think I had to look in the rules more than twice once starting, and this is a long and at times heavy game.  Everything feels balanced, wonderfully thematic and chromed-out.  But i realized about 5 hours into it that TI3 isn't a game for me.  I just don't think I have the stamina to take on a 6-8 hour game.  As well, I don't find the game deep enough to really justify the time.  There is a lot to do to build forces and plan your attacks, but it all feels a little repetitive in the end.  Maybe it's because the game is so long?  Also, I'm guessing that the "fun" comes from building a force (while your opponent does the same) and then crashing into either player's sector and rolling dice forever until someone reigns supreme.  This happened in my game.  I literally spent two hours building up a force and planning an attack on Mecatol Rex.  I admit that it can be an attractive property, and our forces were somewhat balanced so it was worth a try.  But here we go, I roll a lot of bad rolls and my opponent rolls a lot of good ones.  I am wiped out and she stands alone at the end.  But considering that was my plan for the last 2 hours, did I just waste my time?  Should I have planned other contingencies?  Was it possible to do so, considering the public goals and my private goal which required Mecatol?  These are questions that I could answer if I spent more time with the game.  But I have SO much fun with other games that are also battle games and I can get it done in a few hours.  For me, 6 hours of TI3 didn't feel twice as epic as any 3 hour game, only twice as long.  I will reserve too much judgement on what is clearly a very loved, multi-faceted game, only considering that I have played once.  Whether my feelings about TI3 are just, I do know that this is not the experience I am looking for in a game.  Too long, too stuffy, too sprawling.

Twilight Imperium is my favorite game at the time being. I love the space empirebuilding theme and the fact that a game often includes lots and lots of diplomacy and strategy. However it is not a game you just pick up and play within a few min. It takes a while to learn, it takes a while to setup and it also takes a long time to play if more than 3-4 players. You can spend a full day completing a game if playing 6 ppl, but the game really shines when playing with more ppl so its well worth it. The rating 10 is well deserved in this case in my opinion.

Way too long for me to play regularly. Not really the sort of theme I like either. But it's a well-designed game and if you're going to play that sort of thing I guess this is a very good one. Encourages turtling and that's pretty boring.

 A lot of fun to play but may have some rules/mechanics problems, most notably the fairly low correspondence between victory points and what's actually going on in the game.  There are also an excess of rules for some actions in the game.  Other minor problems include length & need for 5-6 (preferably experienced) players.  With some house rules, this is a 9. Plays somewhat better with scoring rules variants.

How I strain not to give this mess a 1.  This game was absolute in it's shear unplayability - and I suffered for hours through a game.  I can only imagine people try to find fixes and reasons to play this because of the handfuls of cash they laid down for this horror.  One of the few games I truly can't understand why people enjoy. Most games, at least, have some merit, this game has none.

UPDATE: In reflecting over my one experience with this game, I have to claim I would prefer to be Hitler's goat eaten testicle before embarking on this hell train again. What do people see?  I remember thinking this was a rip off when Barnes and Noble were liquidating it for a dollar - still do.  Dropping to a one, for payback over repeated nightmares.

An awesome 4x game that can be a blast to play. The only problem is that the game can last a very long time, especially if you plan to play with more than 4 people. It also takes a long time to explain the rules to newcomers, but if they have the patience to learn, it could be a blast.

I decent Euro war game. Basic rules not intuitive so first game will take twice as long as a normal game. I little more luck then I  was expecting after hearing the complaints of Eclipse vs. TI, turns out Eclipse has less of a luck factor in my opinion. It's a fun game but could be easily swayed to something horrible if you have some Diplomacy idiots :)

Pros:
- so many different paths to victory
- each race feels very different. Good balance between all of them.
- I personally had great fun playing this game, with a quite epic race for victory towards the end.

Cons:
- I was hoping this game would please both types of players who enjoy aggression and those who don't but surprisingly, it wasn't that well received by both. The issue is that players who want to play a bit of a fight end up frustrated by the amount of mechanics that is blocking them (diplomacy, action cards, etc) and non- aggressive players still feel under the threat of their neighbour building a huge army and willing to test it.
- One of the strategy cards (Imperial) is not very fun. It breaks a little bit the game, by basically deciding the first 2 strategy cards that will be picked and makes the game poorer. Also, it feels like a design flaw and a weird way to earn 2 victory points.
- Looking at the time investment, the group felt the game didn't deliver up to expectations, which could be because it was the first time we were playing, we'll see.
- the game pace is very exponential, very slow to start with and quite epic towards the end. Some people might like something more nervous.
- with four players, the distance between each player is such that it is possible to mind your own business during the first 3 or 4 turns, limiting player interaction.
- The art of the components is just ok - by today's standards, they are not holding up against competition - Star Wars: Rebellion for the miniatures or Archipelago for the tiles.

Good design, although too long for my tastes. I do appreciate it's heaviness and epic feel, but for me it's too long. Technology cards with tons of lines of (SMALL FONT!!!) text. This game just screams - create me an iconography! There also should be the technology tree helpcard included for every player. Or a technology tree player where players would just sign which technologies they've acomplished.
Beside I don't really like the space opera theme...

I was lucky enough to see a demo of this game at GenCon Indy in 2005. As a fan of the 4X computer games I was very excited about TI3 (I haven't played TI or TI2) and picked it up the day it arrived in my FLGS. We played the game the next day and I was not disappointed. Of course, we did a few things wrong in the early turns. =) My wife, myself and our gaming friends have played a number of German and American board and card games over the last few months. Some of the games we have played: Settlers of Catan (of course), Puerto Rico, Warcraft, Carcassonne, Mystery of the Abbey, and Citadels. I enjoyed this game more then any of the other games we have played.

RATING: 7
'Bit of a Cluster-Fuck Milkshake. Huge, epic, bloated beast-whale of a game that defines it's genre. Takes a lonnnnnnng time to play (but that's expected)- an eternity of downtime. Eclipse scratches the same itch and does it quicker & more elegantly. That's not to say Eclipse is a better game, but more likely to be pulled out. If a day is to be eaten away by a game, there are others I'd rather play than TI. But it is a classic and should be played at least once by everyone.

RATING: N/A
I honestly don't know when I'm ever going to be able to play this.  It seems to require six players for a full experience.  That's four players more then I can count on at any given time.  That combined with the length and seeming complexity makes this ridiculous.  Don't get me wrong.  I'll play with four players, but I want to play a six player game before I form an opinion of it.

An elegant yet very involved objective based strategy game set in a sci-fi space setting.  This is a gamer's game.  Combat, intrigue, politics, technology, it's all here and beautifully balanced.  The strategy card mechanic is genius and engaging.  Hidden action cards and objectives are nice but can really swing the game, perhaps more than they should.  Requires 3+ players (6+ is preferred) and many hours of play, but worth the investment if you have the patience.

So still unsure about this game.

Game 1:  Imperial 1 card incredibly broken and poor game design in my opinion.  Forcing players to select certain strategies on certain(for them to have any shot at winning)is just not fun.

Game 2:  Played with expansion strategy cards from SE. game went much better this time.  However the lack of objectives etc... makes this game somewhat longer.

Currently rated a 7 because I can see the potential there, just need to find the right combination of the multitude of variants provided.  I know there is one where more objectives are out at the start and I really want to try that one.

Space empire building game of epic proportions (in every sense). Basically a board-game version of the old "Master of Orion" computer game.

RATING: 5
Rating dropped from 8 to 5 as my preferences have changed and new games (especially Runewars) have been published that scratch the same itch, but in much more streamlined package.

Ultimately an ambitious game that seems intriguing to play every once in a while - there is exploration, politics, warfare and scientific research. The problem is that the game tends to take a very long time (6-7 hours) and move slowly, so even there is a lot of good things in here, they get dragged out. I also dislike the way the PDS units bog things down by being able to control large areas of the board too effectively.

Definitely recommend using the new strategy cards from the Shattered Sun expansion.

Simply the best board game I have played. Epic, beautiful, dense, so many options, thematic, variable. It requires a large number of players, but it is so worth the effort.

First game (3P) went even longer than planned, but still liked it.  I also played a mammoth 8-player game. (4 teams, two races per team)  I expect the rating to go up with more experienced, shorter plays, but I really like the overall system.

RATING: 9
This game is absolutely fantastic, but only if you enjoy long games. If you are looking for a quick in and out game that is simple to learn, you are barking up the wrong tree. The game plays best with six players and someone should have a very firm grasp of the rules so they can direct play, otherwise things will bog down and kill the fun. The game is big, long, expensive, and complicated. These aren't knocks on the game, it's simply what it is. What you are rewarded with is an epic gaming experience that combines diplomacy, technological development, warfare, intrigue, and space exploration. If you have the time to properly devote to learning and playing the game, this is the best of its kind.

The grand-daddy of space strategy games. It's a ridiculous box with a ridiculous amount of stuff in it and it takes a preposterous amount of time to play. That said, there's more to it than almost any other board game out there and it's a completely unique play experience.

This is an awesome game, however the length of time it takes to play it is it's downfall. I just don't have the time to sit down and play it, as much as I want too. And with 4 other players all humming and hawing over their moves, it takes forever to get going. First game went from 2pm to 10pm straight, and we were no where near done.

RATING: 9
Simply awesome. So many options, choices...pieces...hours of missing time. The time it takes to play, and maybe a bit of the dice combat are the only detractors to my scoring. (Granted, you are still quite engaged during almost every moment!)
The TI universe is really cool too and fleshed out with spectacular art work. I would probably invest in an artbook if they released one.

RATING: 6.5
I finally got to play this epic game after hearing so much about it. It didn't disappoint but it is a bit different than I thought it would be. Very excited to get this one out again.

Several plays later. The game has two main problems. A lack of a robust political system and some of the strategy cards have awkward abilities that are rarely used or easily "gamed" by the players. I still enjoy the game but I am not as excited by it. I think they need to move away from the strategy cards and create more flexibility in board position and a more robust political system in future editions if they ever release another one.

I own all three editions of this game, so there's some nostalgia in this rating. I really enjoy the combat which is heavier than risk but not as heavy as a hex/counter game, love the player interaction, love the new roles, the technology tree, which was innovative when it first came out, has been streamlined effectively, and the components wow'd me!  Loses 1/2 point for still allowing for some turtling. Those who rated this a 1 should go back and see what a 1 rating is supposed to reflect.

Once upon a time, I called this my favorite game. I love the rich deep theme and the big world that I can get lost in. I love the ship miniatures, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the political debating and voting to pass the laws that change the rules of the game. Unfortunately due to its unwieldy length and complex rules, coupled with its 3 player minimum, it almost never hits our table. I will probably trade it away or sell it one of these days, and that day will probably make me very sad.

[b]Twilight Imperium III[/b] [i]Cristian Petersen 2005[/i] 
What an epic game Twilight Imperium 3 is! Im not a fan of space games but I must admit that this one combines almost flawlessly (it has some minor issues though) many of the best features of other games. Superb plastic bits, beautiful systems, a ton of cards... Fantastic game that has also a lot of an euro system in its core rules since combat is not enough by itself to achieve victory.  Of course, diplomacy and resources management also count a lot. Both expansions fix the issues and make this game better. Original design deserves an eight but this rating is improved to an almost perfect ten with the two excellent expansions.

July 9, 2007 - I'm a bit on the fence with this one, but giving it an "8" for now.  It is a great, fun epic space game, but it has a few niggling problems, and one big one with the ISC, which is broken out of the box.  If variants can fix it, it will retain this rating. 
Oct 2007 - Shattered Empire solves the problems, but the game does flounder under it's own weight.  Still a great space game, but very heavy.

After trying this game with the expansions, I can say that this game isn't bad.  Long as hell, but not bad.  Got through the first game in 9 and a half hours with 4 players.  The game has good entertainment value, but you can get the same amount of entertainment, and then some, in half as much time (at the very least) with other board games out there.  After playing it, I couldn't help but think that it's just about as fun as Cyclades, Chaos in the Old World, and Dune, only at twice the length.

Twilight Imperium (3rd Ed.) is a fine game for players who like deep, complex games that take days to complete. I've played three or four times for several hours and have yet to see a game fully completed. The closest we came was acknowledging that one player would have won in the next go-around. It's great to have such depth of play, but you just have to be willing to invest several hours in a game, and this one goes on just a tad too long for my tastes. If you like strategic complexity on a high level, then you'll likely love Twilight Imperium. If you're looking for a game you can actually complete in less than half a day, you might want to look elsewhere.

If there is an opposite term of elegance, it would be Twilight Imperium. There are some really weird design choices here, where they try to cram in as many mechanics as possible in one game making it several mini games. But it is a game I am emotionally involved in and outside the game.

This game is a full day of experience. There is a lot of chrome, but also meaningful decisions all the time. For new players it can be a little overwhelming, but most people have thought it was fun anyway.

This game has great potential, potential that can be realized given the right circumstances. Those circumstances include: a) many changes to the rules (some things are just unworkable, or clearly flawed, such as, for instance the way the imperial card works i.e. the way you win the game), and b) a dedicated team of players (if your head isn't in this one it can be a real nightmare).

I love the fact that I once won through trade and diplomacy while the other two players waged war on each other. This game is a keeper in my collection, forever!

It is a long epic game, but has little downtime if played in three-four people. It has a solid "7" from me. 
I'd like to see how the expansion changes the game.

RATING: 9.5
A space epic with large amounts of care put into it. I've spent a solid 2 or 3 hours reading all the race sheets and cards (with descriptions/quotes) alone, the world that FFG has crafted is spectacular. The game play is top notch as well with dozens of options per turn and a terrific combat system. I only have a couple of quibbles with the game, 1st, I don't like the fact that you can turtle your way to victory with Imperial. Secondly, that you can only apply for one public objective per phase. Though with the application of the Shattered Empire expansion and a house rule or two, the game became an absolute hit.

One word is enough to describe this game. Epic!. The only thing that makes me not give this a 10, is the amount of time it takes to play, which makes it so hard to gather a group willing to play it.

Have played this once. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the game or the game mechanics- the game itself is perfect

BUT

Too long - each game takes about forever. Nowadays I haven´t got the time to play one game for 12 hours, nor the place to leave the game board and pieces lying as they were, to be continued at some point in the future.

I really, really want to love this game, but the time commitment is too great - even for an "epic" game.  I found the cards to be wildly unbalanced, with drastic effects on combat outcome.  Maybe with fewer players (we had 7 with the expansion) and a better understanding of the game flow, I could rate this one higher.

Another Space Game...go figure.  This game has massive replay-ability, but be warned it takes no less than 4 hours to play. 

The "bits" to this game are excellent, very well done.  There are lots of them.  I went out to Walmart and bought myself one of those sorting tool boxes to keep all the pieces separate.  The box is massive enough to hold this tool box so all is well.

This game is best played with 4 or more players.  I think this is a great game for the handful of times I have played it.

The 44 page manual seems a little daunting at first but with the help of other players we managed to figure it out on the first play.  

(Whoever at Fantasy Flight Games said lets put the manual online so everyone can read the rules had a great Idea)  The easiest way to play a game is to send an email to your friends saying ...on game night we are going play this new game I bought, go to this link to read the rule book.  "AWESOME"

Monumental scale game of space opera strategy. Not my style in theme or mechanics, but I appreciate the work that was put on it. 

This is a great example of a game which would be well translated to a digital format, due to so many moving part and fiddly bits. Also, the chance to play it online over days could draw me towards it.

I have only played this game once so far, but I really enjoyed it.  We played with the first expansion, had 8 people who had never played before, and had a great time.

Tied with Battlestar Galactica for our group's favourite game. We cannot get enough of this. The length of the game is the single biggest flaw, and the only one which ever gives us pause. The right gaming group is essential. Despite the "hardcore" feel of the game, it is best played with people who won't get overly competitive or constantly leave the table to brag to passerbys.

Favorite galactic civ/empire type game I've played.  It has nice components, trade, combat, resource Mgmt, etc.  Worm holes and command points help prevent some of the "turtle" defense build up tactics that plague other conquest games.  Evenso, this isn't primarily a heavy conflict game at it's core, merely part of the game.  I think that's why I like it so much.  There is much more going on than a typical sweep the board conquest game.

RATING: 5
Seems far too long and convoluted for my tastes. VPs are very difficult to come by and so taking the Imperial Card is almost compulsory. If I want a space exploration/combat type game I'll probably play Nexus Ops. If I want a civ/combat type game I'll probably play Antike. Both much shorter.

Edit: I decided to give this another go but this second game took even longer and we didn't even finish (6 rounds played in 8-9 hours). The game isn't bad as such, it just takes so long that if I'm going to be playing games for that length of time I'd much rather play several other excellent games than this one. I also think that the hidden objectives and the turn order will basically decide the winner, i.e. someone who is able to complete the hidden objective and who is early in the turn order to pick up the Imperial card for a second time will almost certainly win.

Don't be fooled. This is THE ultimate space opera simulator. The are other really nice games in the same genre (such as Eclipse or Space Empires: 4X) but none deliver an experience as rich as Twilight Imperium. Yes it needs 8 hours to play. But if you have the time (and that's a big if) and you love the genre, you can't go wrong with this one.

Seems long time-wise, but is fun if you have time to burn.  I would prefer a dice-less(or at least smaller variance than d10) combat system, but I like the way that hit points are dealt with to keep from bogging down combat. I also prefer a smaller pool of random draw cards in a game that is driven by player interaction.  Large amounts of different cards are more necessary in games with less interaction.  

Also, I have to say I only played 4 player and would love to see the bonus counters in action.  Hopefully, we will play 5-6 player next time.

ah, once a '10', falling due to expansion creep and bad play.  Now, a '7' is the best it can be because I will only play it under certain circumstances.

The rules under which TI3 will be played again:

1.  No colluding players; way too much of players deciding before they game that they won't be attacking each other.

2.  Players must understand how VP scoring works.  Turtles and attacking/screwing for no VP 'because I can' need not apply.

3.  The long war (14VP); no.  longer does not equate to better.

4.  Distant suns; no:  added game time and luck for no real benefit.  Good luck versus bad luck here can be a real balance swinger.

5.  Leaders; okay

6.  Sabotage runs; not worth the mental overhead

7.  Shock troops; okay

8.  Space mines; no.

9.  wormhole nexus; okay

10.  tactical retreats; okay

11.  custodians of Mecatol Rex; yes!

12.  Voice of the Council:  50/50.

13.  preliminary objectives:  50/50.

14.  race-specific tech:  yes

15.  Flaghips:  50/50.

16.  final frontier:  no!  another balance-altering luck factor that adds to game time.

17:  Mech Units;  50/50; the ambiguity and BS rulings about when these are Ground Forces and when they are not makes me want to not play with them anymore.

18:  Mercenaries;  yes, adds a cool element.

19:  Political Intrigue (i.e. Political II or Assembly II); never again.  added game-time and the nonsense of 'I assasinate you because I can' take-that.  Promissory Notes are similar that it adds time and except for game-throwing I Support the Throne, a waste of time.

Includes Shattered Empire, Shards of the Throne, fleet bases, and painted miniatures.

Way too long for what it is.  An extreme exercise in tedium and blandness.  A 9+ hour game where nothing really happens.  

My position was clearly irrelevant in the galaxy by the 3rd turn (Not due to any choices on my part).  Not just sour grapes because the winner of the game said it sucked and called it painful.

Afterwards we played Long Shot and I had more fun in 45 minutes with that one than I did all day at Twilight Imperium.

A good game with complications, chief among them the forced passivity of the four player variant. HavenÂ´t tried a game with six players yet, and am willing to modify the score afterwards.Other than that, this game hits my preferences spot on. ItÂ´s epic science fiction empire building with huge battles, what more could one ask for?

I modified my rating from 8 to 9 after we found out weÂ´d been misinterpreting the rules at some points and had a go with the correct ones, particularly regarding miscalculation of fleet supply during attack. Now I can say that yes, this game is tremendous fun even with just four players.

Our group has not experienced the famous problem with the Imperial strategy. It probably depends on your style of play, for the group certainly is competitive despite that.

Setting aside the fact that it encourages turtling, setting aside the fact that the rules are a poorly-worded affront to usability, setting aside the grotesquely unbalanced everything (cards, chits, powers, etc. etc.) that have a huge effect on the game state, setting aside the fact that the victory conditions are at best stale and at worst utterly broken, setting aside the fact that the components themselves are some of the least user-friendly I've seen... Wait, what was I getting at?
Oh, yeah. Setting aside all that, there's precious little to actually do! You're always constrained by artificially-imposed bottlenecks or the simple fact that in this "epic" 8 hour monstrosity you basically just play weaksauce Puerto Rico in space and slowly move your lumbering fleets around.

This game is a blast...my only complaints is that the game scares most people away due to its intensity, leaving me with few choices on game night :( ...a game like Settlers is easy to understand for everyone, so a lot of people I FORCE to play this game ends up saying "Lets play Settlers"...I then ban them from my home forever. Its almost a requirement that people read the rules themselves before playing, otherwise, there will be someone explaining 5,000 things during the game, decreasing that players ability to stratigize. But that's what makes this game so fun. It is NOT for the weak of heart. Another thing I can do without is the Imperial Strategy Card. It does speed up the game play somewhat, but no one in my group wants to take it! Its not that we're stupid, we just think its a boring card. We're currenting looking for a variant that suits our style of play. I also think a few races are underpowered/underwhelming...but other than that this game is so much fun to play. I love it!

Everything people tell you about TI is true. It is an epic space opera that you will never forget. The biggest thing keeping this from a 10 is that you are almost required to play with imperial II strategy card which comes in the expansion as the version in the original game box is too strong. 

But if you want a game with diplomacy, battles, and all the flavor, look no further. Just be ready to look for the next 10-12 hours as the games are quite long.

Epic space conquest/diplomacy game.  A good combination of direct confrontation and sneaky win conditions.  Plus really cool bits and upgradable ships.  The expansion is a must.

I'd played this before and found it interesting, but a long long playing time involved.  So finally broke down, got it, and had a group of 6 players for it.

And once again I keep thinking that though it is an interesting game with a wonderful concept, it's just a LONG drag out.  There really needs to be a way to speed this game up better.  Maybe the other races in the expansion and variant rules would help with that.

It's still a neat game, but it's going to be hard to convince everyone to sit down for another long dragged out brawl in getting this done.

Joc de civilitzacions espacials amb guerra, diplomacia, tecnologies, races asimétriques, etc... Té rejugabilitat infinita i és imposible cremarlo. A més, hi han un munt de variants que canvien el joc totalment (objectius secrets o descoberts, mapes predefinits, distant suns, etc...).

Les partides es poden allargar molt (fins a més de 10h...) i es necessiten 4 o més jugadors per poder jugar. Es necesaria la primera expansio per poder jugar en condicions, ja que la carta de estrategia 8 del joc bàsic és totalment desequilibrant...

Actualització després de més partides: em continua semblant un imprescindible, tot i que hi han certes mecàniques que no m'acaben de convencer del tot: la política és un afegit que només fa que allargar el joc i no aporta gaire, hi han algunes cartes de acció molt desnivellades, i les condicions de victoria no acaben de funcionar bé al 100% (alguns objectius son més fàcils per unes races que per unes altres, etc...). Les partides se'm fan massa llargues i, al final, poden resultar fins i tot repetitives. Massa guerra freda.

Good: Strategic - Sience Fiction - Medium 

Should be played with the expansion.

-Awsome theme, beautiful script
-Simply unsurpassed compomemts
-A tiny price for what you get. Best value game I have ever bought.
-Playable. Not complicated at all and best if someone already played it to show how it works.

The ultimate game that is playable and incorporates military, economy, trade and politics into one game. Simply the most brilliant game ever invented that works, is accessible and fun to play.
Yes it is long but it is long FUN!!

My only tiny quibles:
-Fighters are slightly too strong compared to the price you pay for them
-A war Sun or destroyer both count to 1 ship against your Fleet Supply and this feels a bit odd. 

This is the ultimate gaming experience is really difficult but if you have mastered all factors: enough time, the right players, repeated sessions, you probably had one of the ultimate gaming experiences one can have in life.

If this would only be a game about nowadays politics on planet earth...
Please print Reins of Power!!

Update: recently played a 6 player game with expansion. I was the Nekro Virus and this race ROCKS! The Nekro Virus can only obtain technological advances by stealing them from neighbours.
If their mother ship is distroyed, it destroys all other ships in that space as well.
One of the political representatives can blow himself up and kill all other representatives.
We had a great time and the changes throught the expansion are worth it.

RATING: 4
A well intentioned game, I guess. And well crafted, too. But there's three things that make me doubt I'll ever play it again:
First, it's design is driving your actions less by giving you lots of things you can do and letting you decide what you want to do most and more by stripping you of possibilities and letting you decide between everything that remains. Not really my cup of tea.
Second, it doesn't feel like the guy who wins was the best at building and maintaining a space empire. It feels more like the guy who wins did the right arbitrary (and sometimes even unthematic) stuff at the right moment and cashed in the most points.
Third and most important, it's just not worth the time you have to invest in it. I can get the fix of everything this does in a shorter time with a game that's more fun. Maybe not everything at the same time, but individually.

Huge space opera game! This one has it all: Politics, research, exploration, expansion, ground and space forces, different classes of ships, and tons more. Quite good mechanics, too, with variable turn orders.

Politics, notably, denote "table politics" more than "ingame politics cards" - the ingame ones might be able to change the game's rules, change what's an act of war and what isn't, or change how much income people get or what they can research at what cost, but don't really influence alliances between players directly (though of course, getting friends to help you push the agenda you really want is always a good thing).

What's really great about this game is the scope it has, and the depth that comes with it. It's not just a really long game, but a really engaging one as well.

Also works very well (but takes a very long time) in PBeM form. And I still feel bad about the PBeM games I abandoned :(

Enjoyed the first play big time.  This map layout was somewhat imbalanced I think.  And a lot of ganging up on the runaway leader.  But otherwise really fun.  Second play was solid and more balanced, but it ended a bit abruptly.  With experienced players may consider adding a round or two?

It has many problems but is nevertheless fun; it feels truly epic.
My gripes:
-too long; the boring beginning is fixed in the extension
-rules could be more concise
-races feel unbalanced
-need fixes (provided in extension as usual for ffg)
-has cards that allow players to run through the discard pile (of course nothing limits the time such player is allowed to do so)
8 with Shattered Empires

However, all the chrome is there, and the PR role-choice system has been put to good use; other more innovative little mechanisms blend in to make a coherent and enjoyable whole.
As usual, the components are top notch (as usual, you have nothing to sort them).
I wish I could play this more (with Shattered Empires).

There are some good ideas in this game, unfortunately it is very dependent on the setup you have and the race you've picked.  A low tech race with low resource planets besides a high tech race with twice your resources turns into a waste of 5 hours, unless the other races can gang up.  Very dependent on player experience and willingness to negotiate.  It is a political game after all.

RATING: 6
This game is epic - there really isn't any other way to describe it. There's politics, economy, negotiation, exploration, battle, logistics, and more. Granted, to do all of these things almost immediately requires a whole slew of rules but here, it's more of a guiding framework which is broken/reinforced by rules and unique cards. So there really isn't anything you can't do, so long as you have the cards that allow you to do so, which makes for a lot of clever surprises throughout. Furthermore, because the game creates something not akin to a rubber band, but rather a molasses of point acquisition, it is difficult for a leader to emerge - however, once a leader does emerge it is difficult to stop them without some collusion and collaboration. This is a nice feature as it means that there is an ongoing and necessary checking of power between players, shifting alliances and crafty collusions. Accordingly, as a necessary feature, the game has a first to 10 points (space objectives which can not be undone), or most points when the "game end" card appears such that there is always movement towards an inevitable end. While this game is certainly longer than what I tend to play, it doesn't feel as long as it does and, as you would hope, there are big game changing moments which feel epic (great/devastating depending on which side of the equation you are on). I won't say it is elegant, clean, or pure, but it is certainly a well-designed game whose mechanical structure (or framework) allows for a rich, thematic inter-player flow of events to occur.

RATING: 9
The ultimate strategy/civilization/conflict/ area control game - it really has it all. If you can find enough players dedicated to set aside the time needed to play this game, it is a fantastic experience. Rules can be somewhat overwhelming for some players, although I find this much easier to grasp and more intuitive than some other games in my colletion (e.g Arkham Horror). At least one of the players have to know the rules before playing for the first time - it is not a game where you can look up everything as you go along.

Replayability is close to endless with the different races and the variable starting universe. The Shattered Empire expansion is recommended.

I just wish I had more time available to play this and that I knew a few more players willing to play such a long game.

I can see why this game is so highly revered. It is a good game, but a real investment in both time and effort from the players. I would almost say that I think that this game is a hobby all of its own. To fully inhale this game, you got to know everything about the strategic tiles you can choose, know the special abilities of all the races in play, know what the diffrent leaders do, and finally know the possible action cards that could come in to play.

For me, this is just a little bit to much of a game. I can play this game a couple times per year, but that's about it, it is just so heavy. There is simply just too much to keep track of in this game. I really understand that the real strategy-game lovers appriciate this one, but I'm just not the target audience...

Wonderful production when it comes to the ships and board, really good looking!

After a recent play, I have realized that this game has fallen out of favor with me.  A 4-player game took over 8 hours.  There is too much focus on Mecatol Rex.  Trade and Politics are underpowered and rely too heavily on the meta game, and cause some awful amounts of randomness.  So much downtime.  To think that I could have fit a bunch of other 10-rated Euros in this time frame is sad, but no matter how well I learn the game or play with groups who know it, the game time doesn't go down.  I don't see this hitting the table again, perhaps not ever, and so I'm putting it up for trade.

I don't mean to blaspheme - I just haven't had the chance yet ton play this masterpiece with the right amount of players (4+)!

RATING: 7
Wew!

A massive game that takes some studying to get to grips with, but that rewards you handsomely for doing so.

All I can say is that if you can gather a few players that have the stamina to learn the rules of this game and set aside a huge chunk of time exploring it, you'll be rewarded. If.

The time component always gets brought up, and for good reason.  This game can easily last 60-90 minutes per player!  And with 6 or more players, you'd need to include another 90 minutes lunch or dinner break.  That's half a weekend's commitment!

On the positive side, you'll not feel as if that much time has passed, since this game has a good narrative feel to it, and players feel involved most of the time.

Another plus point is the game's affinity for modification.  Optional and house rules are worthwhile investigating, and some more recommended than others.  Finding a good, working set for your group is half the fun of exploring this behemoth.

Good game. But I think Eclipse offers more for less. The economy seems to have more dimensions in Eclipse, the technologies are more straightforward in eclipse... and in Eclipse I've never seen a player eliminated.

The danger as I see it of playing this game with new players is that they see the purpose of the game as being to fight each other and control territory. Planets are key to gaining resources but you should NEVER lose focus of the goal which is to collect victory points.

Petty border squabbles over meaningless planets that do nothing to get you points do neither player ANY favours. If a less experienced gamer spends his whole game doing this at your expense then it can suck the fun out of this thing in a big bad way. Unfortunately I've now been in that position. I've been in said position in other games and it can be 30 minutes of boredom then playing something else but with this particular beast it is unfortunately up to 6 hours of utterly relentless boredom.

If I had six to eight hours, I'd play this. An epic experience. It's true, everyone should get the Shattered Empire expansion to correct the Initiative-ISC flaw. We've played it with the "Age of Empire" variant, with a hand-crafted ISC II card, which has worked well so far.

Update (4/11/09): After playing SE a number of times, there's no going back to the base game, so I'm knocking it down to a '9', just to distinguish TI3 from SE. Also, without ISC II, I'm thinking this would be an '8' with the original ISC. All further updates on the SE entry.

RATING: 10
Epic in every dimension.  And, despite all the ISC brouhaha, it plays just fine right  out of the box.

UPDATE:  This is still a great game, the experience growing more rich and nuanced as we become more familiar with it.  This is definitely one of those games that requires repeat plays—difficult for most, I know, as the first couple of plays can be excruciatingly long and fraught with error.  All I can say is stick with it; like the monster games of old the wonders in this box are only revealed through familiarity.

[b]ISC and other tweaking:[/b]

The best version of this game is played with the Age of Empire & The Ancient Throne variants.  AoE, found in the rulebook, lays all the public objectives out in a row and allows for long-range strategic planning.  AT, an official variant found on Fantasy Flight's website, changes the ISC to 1VP if you control Mecatol Rex—in addition, it allows you to earn as many VP objectives as you qualify for, all at once.*  It makes for a longer game (with no 2VP clock counting it down) but with far more interaction, with emphasis on the ACTION!!!

[size=7]*This is also now the Imperial II Strategy Card found in [thing=22821]Shattered Empire[/thing].[/size]

[b]Board setup for more interaction:[/b]

Take the best double systems and place them randomly around Mecatol Rex (so the first ring is made up of resource- and influence-rich gems of the Empire).  Then build the other rings as normal.  This prevents the usual layout of the galaxy—with players each residing in their own premium "turtle pockets" that are bordered with crap while the throneworld of Mecatol Rex languishes in a backwater ghetto.  Surrounding it with double systems forces players to move fleets up the ladder and into sweaty proximity around Mecatol Rex for a turn (or so) of hard stares and eye-twitching until someone pulls the trigger on the Last War and makes the jump for Mecatol.  With everyone having a fleet one hex out, the game becomes a Rolling Storm of Woe mitigated only by political shenannigans and shady trading...

UP-UPDATE:  Aw, hell... who am I kidding?  With the advent of the [thing=22821]Shattered Empire[/thing] expansion, this is a rock-solid 10.  Slathered miles-deep in theme, diplomacy & intrigue, massive space fleet engagements & ground combat—there's nothing else like it.  Nothing even comes close.

I sold this since pre-ordering TI4 and being unable to get any of the expansions for a reasonable price.  I'm looking forward to a mega game session over it with friends.  

Don't be too excited about selling your copy because all the expansions are starting to hit the market for reasonable prices as the community learns of TI-4 and offloading them.  With the 3 expansions, this game is reportedly awesome and not entirely different from TI-4.

Fun.  Manageable (despite the size & length).  Has a few small shortcomings that the Shattered Empire expansion fixes (if you don't have the expansion, at least use the updated strategy cards).

Longest games I have played (8-12 hrs) and not one I would want to play frequently but still an epic experience, which sets it apart from Eclipse in my opinion. Unfortunately not playing it often leads to forgetting many rules and lessons learned from past plays. Also, there is an element of randomness and Amerithrash flavor to it. I don't mind that so much but I have found it frustrating to have a hours of a strategic plan fail due to a momentarily flawed tactical battle decision.

I don't have the expansion yet so the Imperial strategy has been a cumbersome mechanic (whoever picks that card the most wins, regardless of the game position) but we all love it despite that problem.

It is bad as a 3 player game however since once two players start a conflict the advantage to the third player is always enough to win.

RATING: 6
This, the archetypal American big box game is yet another multi-player conflict affair in which the best strategy is to 'turtle'. There's certainly no shortage of ambition in the design. This is an empire building game which incorporates conflict, trade, diplomatic and technological elements. You'd hardly expect a game this big to be balanced, fair or free from chaos and sure enough it isn't. The random setup can give far more opportunities to some as the tiles are not equally valuable, similarly the strategy choices will see the Imperial and Initiative tiles taken first with the rest a mediocre option. It also has the usual arbitrary player attacks, luck of cards and dice and the possibility of kingmaking.
In spite of all the above, there's still a good chance of having fun. Nothing is too 'thinky' so you can relax and chuckle at others' misfortune during the inevitable downtime. Although the game takes 6+ hours, time will pass quickly. In the end though you'll find it strange that more of the problems haven't been ironed out over three editions and realise that Tempus is the same game (even down to similar problems) in a quarter, or less, of the playing time.

An OK game with plastic figures that are too big for the hexes they have to occupy.  There are so many official variants now that there's bound to be a version to suit all players.

Build up your fleets, send them out to conquer, hope for no counter-attacks during the one turn your planets are exposed.

Remarkably, you can win this game without fighting a single battle.  Try the conflict oriented variations to make the game come alive - otherwise it can seem like 4 hours of accountancy.

The game is too chaotic (e.g. in the political cards) and luck-driven (e.g. in the secret objectives) for its length. Even if you do manage to significantly harm a player's fleets, it's entirely possible it won't hurt them in way needed to get victory points.

An excellent space battle/empire/war game with its only major drawback being that a relatively short game will last in excess of 6 hours, while a more typical game will last well over 8 hours.

The role cards (card 8) are totally determining the outcome of the game (if someone strays from the forced path another semi-random player will win the game).

Part of me wants to love this game. So much about it appeals to me. It was my first foray into the explore, expand, exploit, exterminate genre. With tons of rich content, terrific art, customizable tech trees, specialized races, and a variety of ever changing rules and objectives, there's a lot to love about TI3. Unfortunately, it is a terribly long and drawn out game, often taking upwards of 4 hours to play. This for me is a major drawback, because so few people are willing to invest that much time into one sitting. And if a player gets screwed early the remaining hours of play can be pretty unenjoyable.  We also found  the role card which awards 2 VP just for choosing it to be terribly unbalanced in a game where racing to get points is the whole idea. One person can't be allowed to pick it each time or they win by default, which means players are constantly forced to take it if just to prevent others doing so, but this really sucks fun out rather than adding anything worthwhile. We chose to play without this role, or downgrade it to 1VP, and this balanced things. TI3 is fun, but for a lot of casual, beginner, or just busy gamers it's a little too galactic in scope.

RATING: 10
If you have the patience and if you have some friends who share this trait, this is still the best thing to spend 8+ hours around. I played it numerous times during last few years, I remember games that reached conclusion in 2,5 hrs and I remember one particular match that took a little more than 13 hrs. But this is the peculiar thing - I remember pretty much every TI game I played in details. This is a kind of impression that no other game left on me. Of course arranging a game of TI is a nightmare. Explaining rules to newbies takes hours, and game itself rarely ends on the date it started. Scales down badly - anything less than 4 players feels flat and basic due to limited player interactions.

I would rate this game more highly were it not for the serious time commitment required to play it, usually > 4 hours. I  strongly suggest playing with the Age of Empire (objectives revealed from the start) variant, since in a game this long it feels really cheap to have someone snatch a win from a lucky objective draw in the late game.

Finally got to play, they key to this game is prepare and play with fun people. There can be a lot of downtime, especially with new people but if those people are good to chat with and no one takes it immensely seriously it is a total blast. I would play it once a month, especially with the Mecatol Cup at stake.

RATING: 9.5
This epic of space exploration, trade, politics, research, and warfare is certainly the reigning heavyweight in my group. Twilight Imperium will take most of a day to play - about an hour per player - but is worth every minute of it. A review in text cannot fully encompass all of the features with gusto, so go watch a review that will do the game justice. I will say letting people pick their races to start and roleplay the differences - especially through the political phase - is probably one of the most enjoyable aspects of gameplay.

Finally bought this bad boy. I started reading through a tutorial/sample game last night. Here's to hoping I can get this played more than once, because it looks awesome.

update -- aug 14, 2011

Just played my first game. In. Credible.

update -- nov 13, 2011

I've played a couple more games now. My first (referenced above on aug 14) was 6 player without any expansions. I've now added a 7-player and then a 3-player, each with both expansions. I took the rating down from 10 to 9 after my second game, and now I've dropped it from 9 to 7. I like the game, but I don't I love it. As the complaint often goes, the length is a bit of a killer. I'd usually like a little more variation in an entire afternoon and/or evening of gaming. I think TI3 will be a great couple times a year thing for me.

--feb 6, 2013--
Maybe I don't like the game quiiiiite as much as I thought? Every opportunity I've had to play since my last game I've turned down. For a game several hours long, I usually tend to crave something like Starcraft or Dominant Species. Hmm. . .

RATING: 7
Fascinating number of options, but a painful setup and some convoluted rules make this game a bit inaccessible to some people and difficult to get a game in regular enough to remember all of the rules.  Plus, I have never finished a game in less than 5 hours despite the 4hr time due to the large number of decisions every turn..Works well with any number of players 2-6 though. This game is thoroughly original and has everything you could want in a game except brevity and straight-forward rules
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I would recommend getting the Shattered Empires expansion to go with this. There are certain strategy cards in the main version that start a "clock" ticking & force other players to keep that card out of their opponents hands, lest they give them to many victory points.

Fun but LONG game. My first game with 4 experienced players and one other new player was almost 7 hours, but it was engrossing and did not seem like it took that long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First off, this is an awesome game.  It's huge, theme-laiden, rich, bit-heavy, and epic.  I really like how you feel connected to your race while you slowly expand your empire.  The chit system is great and trading, politics, technologies, etc. are a nice added touch.  However, the role system (which is a fantastic idea ala Citadels or Puerto Rico) is implemented rather awkwardly and often results in some out of balance trade-offs.  This would be OK in a cooperative game like LotR, but in a competitve setting like this with limits as to what you can accomplish turn-to-turn, it ends up tasting a bit foul.  If this problem were addressed and fixed I would easily volunteer the time necessary to play this mammoth game much more readily.  Still a solid 8 as is.

One, of not the, best game I've ever played. So much going on on different levels. Backstabbery, strategic choosing of cards, steamrolling over enemies or just poking them for points, or get smashed up by more people if they have the idea that you're about to win. Awesome! Would play it with the expansion and the other stratregy cards since it balances better.

One of my grails, and I finally broke down and bought it. Now the real challenge: to find people who will play, and a free 8 hours to do it in...

Update--Finally played! I'm moving this up to the top--it's nearly perfect. If only somehow it was easier to get on the table, it would be completely perfect--but sacrificing anything to make TI3 shorter or less complex seems wrong. So, 9.8 then, and well deserved.

RATING: 8
Rate is between 10 to 5, because of the length, and the unclearness of rules in special details... 

Comment when it had 10 points:
Some may tell that it is too long... but if you enjoy every minute, then it cannot be too long...
Perfect game as it is!
6-8 hours of battles, politics, backstabbing, negotiation, imperial dreams and struggle for the local domination...

Totally understand the appeal.  Great theme, lots of variability in starting races.  And I'd play it agin . . . however, the game suffers from what I would refer to as  "Munchkin Syndrome."  It's a multi-player game . . . eventually, one player makes a move, several other players pounce on that player to keep them from winning . . . and the guy way across the board who neither gets pounded on by other players, nor has to commit any resources to keeping anyone in check, is the one who wins.

Epic Space-Opera from a 4X game where you should have bunch of free time to play but still it worth that. I think TI3 had done everything better than most of mega strategy games. 

It has political struggle, trading, diplomacy, warfare, logistical planning, everything a mega 4x strategy game needs. Then with the late game appears, Twilight Imperium  evolves to a different game, where has so much tension, clashes of long-term strategies and even in the pitiest situation, a player has always chance to win. 

It is fantastic, gameplay offers many options and totally satisfying, delivers unforgettable game sessions.

both expansions in the base box, only will sell/trade all together.  base game was received in a trade and the box itself is in fairly rough shape.  Inside, the base game components show a little bit of wear, which I covered by sleeving all the action cards, political cards, and planet cards.  Have the galaxy frame to keep a 6 player map together, all ships, tokens, and dice (have extra dice as well) are kept sorted in two plano boxes.  The expansions have seen one play session, look brand new, but I didn't keep the expansion boxes as the one box will hold everything.  No pieces missing.  Buying the fourth edition.

RATING: 6
One of the most famous cosmos backgound games. Twilight Imperium has successfully expressed the great space war among various species in the universe. The game, however, also has a few weak points. First, the game too many rule details so that the game has a high barrier to new participator of the game. For example, the game contains hundreds types of cards. Players cannot get used to those special cards in couple of games. At least more than 5 times matches, users can gradually understand how to use appropriate cards and make a proper strategic decision. Second, the game is not really influenced by players' tactical choices, but the better upgrade situation. A diplomatic approaches, strategies, and dice luck is not really working in this game. The aspect of game is mainly affected by the upgrade level. The higher, the better chance to win. If a player has higher upgrade level, the player has more winning conditions. Therefore, it is hard to catch up technological gaps among players. Because of all of these notorious accessibility and hard rule details, I couldn't give a good grade on the game. Besides these weaknesses, Twilight Imperium is still the one of the best space war games.

RATING: 8
Ideal Players: 6

Description: An extremely complex roll-and-conquer type game that uses some euro-game mechanics like role selection. Research technology, build infrastructure, and conquer the galaxy!

Pro: Technology, politics, and trade all add unusual dimensions for a roll-and-conquer game. Because victory is by Victory Points rather than territory, conflicts are encouraged to be over some meaningful objective. The strategic depth in an 8-hour game is enormous, especially with experienced players.

Con: It requires an 8 to 10 hour time investment, six skilled players, and the most table space of any game I know. Despite all that strategy, random dice can spell victory or defeat.

The epic game, it has tons of things to do if you want to be the emperor of the galaxy. Sadly enough, the way to win doesn't have anything to do with entertainment gaming.

I've only played 4 or 5 times so far, but I haven't really gotten into the game at all.  There are just too many levels of serious power imbalance for my tastes - initial board layout, racial differences, secret objectives, and (especially) action cards.  I dunno, maybe with more play I'll get hooked on some subtle tactical play or something, but for now it's just too dang long for the limited fun I get out of it.

OWNED SINCE 2011
I love this game. Although it can be long, every one at my house enjoys it and it gets played regularly. My smaller kids, ages 7 and up, enjoy building an army and exploring the map or attacking other players (When I play with the younger kids, I have them share a veteran player's "tech sheet"). My older children, 10 and up, really get involved with the game. When playing with our kids, we usually start the game in the evening after dinner, take a break, and finish the next morning once we wake up. It is easy to handicap the better players on this game, so that  everyone can play at their best and not dominate. We also take out some of the victory objects that require a longer game. Players are usually close in "victory points" regardless of the size of their army. Bottom line, it is designed to customize and can fit everyones taste. People I have board gamed with, who do not find the science fiction theme appealing, have enjoyed this game. When we feel like getting involved in a game, this is one of our favorites. I must say that we never use the little "tech" cards that came with the game. I printed out one of the tech trees found at BGG, player made, and we use that to track our technology advances. I also printed out a technology advancement tracker, also player made from BGG, and we use that to keep track of ship upgrades and such. I print them both out on one piece of paper, using both sides of the paper,and we just use a pen to mark what we have. This frees up a lot of cards from the table and makes it easier to remember what you have. IMO, a must have for the game.  
 UPDATED 2014
This game is called complicated. I have also heard it called long. Well, It is not Complicated. In fact, it is one of the few games that I can pick-up after a few months and play without reviewing the rules or player aids. IMO, Mage Knight (which I love) is more complicated (lots more) and just as long (with 3 and more players). I think people have a stereotype of this game that is untrue and prevents them from trying a great game.

Played with 4, 5 and 6 players. Twilight Imperium is overlong and the result of a game is subject to a fair degree of chance. It is atmospheric and can be fun to play but does not quite manage to maintain my interest during those many hours despite the combination of military, technological and political strands.

It's basically Master of Orion the board game.  If you like 4X turn-based computer games, odds are you'll enjoy this game.  It has less exploring than those games have, but quite a bit more political avenues as well.  The pieces to this game are very high quality and so is the art and rule book.  It is really hard to say anything bad about this game and it has borrowed nicely from Puerto Rico in terms of taking on a "role" each turn.  The only draw back is setup time and game length (6+ hours).

The complete free range of opportunities afforded by this game makes it my all-time favorite.  You just have to realize that not every race plays the same way.  You have to change your style depending on your opening draw.  But even races I hated at first I grew to love if they are played right.

Loved the second edition to death. It seems to me that ambition got in the way of design when Petersen put together the third edition, hence the low score. I realized the thing that really bothers me is the lack of "game-shui" -- it does not flow easily even after you get the hang of it.

Awesome gameplay with soooooo many ways to win.  Take for example Mason Palmatier who just played Imperial every turn and ended up winning the game with one cruiser and a home system.

The technology tree is complicated enough to pretty much not have any strategy beforehand.  This mean everyone just rushes to get a War Sun.

A bit long.......need many beers to get through this one you need..........and dedicated people who won't just quit halfway through.

With experience people this game goes surprisingly fast however.

Initial rating 1 play with expansion

Totally overblown but epic game. With the expansion AND a few tweaks, probably close to the best AT game available (my  rating is 8.5 with exp) along with Dune and it reminds me a little of that game with the variable power bonanza, lots of theme, tons of bits, long gametime, a few too many rules but overall a great game of space exploration and civilization.  Typical FF, not completely playtested, ISC is stupid as 2 VP’s (should be 1) plus other little things, some political cards etc, 20 pages of variants tells the story, expansion helps a lot at least but why cant these guys get it right the first time, more outside playtesting damn it!   

First game is a little rough with all the rules/options but it does start to flow nicely once going and I could see my rating going up with more play and a house rule or two (ISC at the least). You can get lucky with the VP chits, not as much of an issue in a full 10VP game but that is one long game, the house rule of 7 or 8 VP's is more to my taste I think, 4 hours is long enough for a multiplayer game.  That is another thing I noticed, it takes some time to ramp up which slows it all down, a faster start would mean a quicker game with more action. Not that much of a wargame again because of slow development, by the time people expand enough the game is winding down, although the full 10 VP game would probably have some more good fights before its done. War should probably be more rewarded too to discourage turtling, like 1 VP for taking over an opponents planet. Reducing some luck with public objectives open at the beginning might help also add some strategy.  

A good strategic game. For me a quicker ramp up and a shorter game that is more balanced (you can say this about almost ALL FF games) would have been a perfect game, maybe some year FF will figure out how to perfect their games.

I've played this four times now, all with the expansion and many of the expansion variants.  Our first game was very long, 9.5 hours for a 4 player game that ended in a tie. That left a bad taste in our mouths. The second time was a three player game that ended very quickly, just 5 turns in. But we had the swing of things and the game moved faster.  It's still a game that I had to fight to get to the table, we like it but no one loves it. I hate to get rid of it and the expansion since we've put so much time into learning it and playing it but I just see it getting played much, so I may end up trading/selling them, we see.

RATING: 7
Fundamentally a incredible sci-fi game.  Epic, complex, but rewarding. The theme is gripping and the game is beautiful. 

PROS:

- Nice mechanic elements and very good game even though all aspects of the game are stolen:
# map: stolen from settlers of catan, the scenaries change in each game.
# roles: stolen from puerto rico, even on choosing a role with primary and secondary actions on each of eight different roles.
# war rules: stolen from axis & alies, but d10 is very randomize, i prefer d6. 

- Fun increases exponentially with number of players.

- Spectacular and excellent components. 


CONTRA:

However there is only 4 major, unforgivable flaws, that makes the game only a rating 7 for me.

1- Too long. Schedule 8 hours to play. 
2- Hard to teach to new players (has too many erratas, requires official faq 1.2 - http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/PDF/ti3FAQ.pdf)
3- It is not a warlike game, to fight does not serve as much. He is better to stay defensive.
4- The imperial strategy card. 


OVERALL:

With some homerules to fix #4 (read http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/PDF/ti3variant.pdf), consider this game a 7.5 for me!

As you play more games the playability raise, you can feel the deepness of the game with all the variations possible: political/action/racial/map/etc.

You may also play only 2 players with specials rules, it does work very well.

Playing at 2 to 5 players is great, personally I think 3 players is very good the game is not too long.

I have played more then 15 games playing with different races, provide a very different gaming experience.
impressive work

The opposite of what FFG is now doing past 2008, mostly games created "on-demand", with very limited deepness and immersive aspect

The best space-opera game to date. Sure it's fiddly, runs over 8 hours, has numerous rules exceptions, and the length of the FAQ rivals most rulebooks, but an 8 player game of Twilight Imperium is epic in a way no other game is.

I haven't played, but the majority of the negative comments are far more convincing than the majority of the positive ones. "Turtling", "Killer downtime" and "Unbalanced" vs. "I love this game", "Great Bits", and "Epic experience." Another game where most of the fun is externally derived? Where the *idea* of, the threat of and tactile giddiness of a large attack fleet supercedes gameplay?

RATING: 8
Grand epic space opera.  Build fleet.  Explore worlds.  Conquer them.  Research tech.  All about getting victory points by meeting objectives on objective cards (like get into a battle or own certain kinds of worlds).  I feel like I should like it more than I do.  Very complex and long.  There is a certain amount of luck in the battles rolling dice and there is a lot of luck in the planet draws.  Can very easily be unbalanced with luck of initial and neighboring planets.  Can be ameliorated a bit if you make sure to balance people's starting allotment of space hexes.  Most tech not terribly important but death star type ships horribly powerful, so not a lot of satisfaction with tech achievements.  Each turn choose a role a la Puerto Rico, which makes for interesting plays.

RATING: 8
A great game, but my last game was 9 hours long. We had 6 players and 4 of who were completely new and I had only played once.  We also took a 1.5 hour dinner break, but still it was to long a game. It is hard for new players to resist the urge to turtle, which makes the game drag and in this case led to a easy victory for the Jol Nar.
This last game was much better, in that it only lasted about 5 hours with 5 players. That seems about right. Got to play another 5 player game as the Winnuu (an expansion race). Woot.
5/19 Played another game with 6 players that took 9 hours again, it was too long and this was mostly an experienced group. We played without the character card that grants 2 victory points a turn so it took a long while to get moving on the victory point track. I played the Borg (i don't remember their real name) and won. Woot!

I played two more games this weekend (9/28-29/2007) I got crunched as the Federation of Sol, but did pretty good as the barony, but not close to winning. 

Played a game as the Yssaril (gollums). Great race, won the 5 player game.

In a vacuum, I probably would have enjoyed this more, but having played Game of Thrones I couldn't help but compare the two. Game of Thrones does everything better.

My biggest gripe with this is, if I'm committing 6 hours to a game, I want to feel in control of what happens. This is too dependent on dice rolls and random objectives.

Still, the space battles in this game are AWESOME and I would absolutely give it another play.

2-1. It's long, and I like that.  I do like fiddling with the rules to either make it more confrontational or varying the victory conditions, since that is the mechanic I think needs it (N-1).  The turn order mechanics, movement, and resource tracking are are elegant.  Your choices for technology, diplomacy, and trade are wonderful.

Amazing game of galactic conquest with war, politics, and plenty of backstabbing. Variants give this game so many options to build the game you want to play.

Play length is obviously a bit long but you get into it and after a while you forget how much time has passed as you're too busy worrying whether your neighbor is going to betray you or not.

Initial Rating: 9.5 (June 2010)

I LOVE this game. It’s a complex game with many options each turn but thanks to this each game is epic. Also the space theme is awesome. The long play time can be a problem for some people but I like long games. Overall this game is in my top 3.

Current Rating: 9.5

TI was one of the first games I purchased and I continue to love it. However, to be honest, if I played the game today I probably would like it a lot less. Still as one of my first loves, it has a special place in my heart but I’m downgrading its rating :D.

It doesn’t have any complex rule per se, but it has many rules. Also the game time is very long, due to this TI is a medium-heavy game for me. You have many interesting options each turn. TI is one of the few games I don’t notice the passage of time, it has lots of down time (the worst sin a game can commit IMO) BUT I don’t feel it as I’m immersed deep into the game, trash talking the current player and trying to influence him :devil:.

I’m aware that the Imperial card has a minor flaw, but that has never stopped us from enjoying the game, besides if you fix the flaw (adding the Imperial card from the expansion) you also add a couple of hours at minimum! For me, the game is very playable right out of the box. 

Best if played with 6 players (but 5 is also very fun). With less than 5 players, the game can be longer because each player now have to take 2 strategy cards. It comes with many cards and races guaranteeing a big replayability factor. Great art and components.

TI was in my Top Ten Favorite Games of all Time, I had to drop it (along with Arkham Horror) to make space for Mage Wars and Netrunner, still I love it, from the theme, to the epicness of the game. It has intrigue, betrayal, politics, trade, war, technology race, alien races and much more. For now my favorite space themed game (Eclipse is a good eurogame but it doesn’t come near TI for me).

I won’t ever sell my copy and I plan to buy the (expensive) expansions. I won’t ever say no to a game of TI.

The game benefits from being an epic event game spanning 10+ hours with immersive roles and swings of power AND playable by 3-4 in a weeknight.  A great design of mixed military, economic, civ-building, & diplomatic games.  The biggest flaw is that the time scales so poorly.  A 3 player game honestly takes 1/2 the time of a 6 player game.  Of course, a six player game is better in every other regard except time.  An irreplaceable part of the collection that plays differently each time.

Edit - Let's change that time commitment to 6.5 hrs for an experienced 8 player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Dropped rating from 6 to 3. Play time is simply too long:
1 hour setup, 1.5 hours to explain the rules. Then 1h per game turn (for a total of 7 hours), and another 0.5 hours to put everything back in the box.

That's a whopping 10 hours. Totally not worth it. It would take a lot of convincing to ever make me play this again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Loads of fun, and fills the civ-building niche nicely.  Has flaws, but enough fun to overshadow the flaws.  Implements PR-style role selection in a dramatically different game, emphasizing the versatility of that mechanism.  Does tend to drag on a little long, with lots of downtime during other players' Tactical Actions.  Combat is extremely devastating to lose, which encourages turtling.  (I'm a turtle by nature, but it's boring if everyone does that.)

Personal note:  Play at least once with the expansion.  From all the comments I've seen, expansion would likely raise this game to a 10.

It's a fantastic space fantasy game which is definitely an epic. I love its variety of strategies, interactions/negotiations among players, space military maneuver and civilization developing flavor. The gaming scope is immense but the gaming mechanics is concise. More players are better, even it means more gaming time. Almost all of the variants given in the appendices of the rule book are worth a try, even it means much more gaming time. The last but not least, Political Strategy phase is usually the most blast and memorable part, especially when it took my 30 minutes ~ 1 hour to come out a big deal between me and my allies. Every one of the memorable Political phases will be an unique experience in my whole life due to the rich of agendas included.

RATING: 3
Every major area of this design is mediocre. The systems combine to make it a logistical pain in the ass to accomplish even simple things. That overhead saps energy from the interesting things one would like to accomplish during the game. It uses a Puerto Rico- or Citadels-like role choice mechanism, yet imbalances the strength of the roles such that many players don't really have a choice. The unit types don't mesh together to encourage any sort of combined-arms approach. It's clear that the designers knew what good, elegant game mechanics were and tried to include some in the game. They failed to do so.

It's much more difficult to grasp than RUNEWARS but once you get it it's not bad at all. There's just soooo much going on that it's hard to foresee every circumstance. The key to the game is holding the central planet to accumulate the needed VP with the "8" card.

I'm surprised this game has so many ratings. If I multiplied the number of ratings this game has times the length of an average game, I'm pretty sure the number would exceed the known lifespan of the universe.

I originally bought a used copy of TI3 without seriously expecting it to get much play; I thought I'd end up soon selling it off myself. Nonetheless, TI3 is a genre-defining game with which any serious hobbyist should be able to profess familiarity, so I essentially dared myself to buy and learn it. I'm a sucker for space opera, which definitely helped.

Most people in my gaming circles hadn't really played anything approximating the scale and duration of an average TI3 session. However, after gathering a group of open-minded and eager individuals for our first game, I realized I had underestimated its appeal. Close to twelve hours (with breaks) flew by and everybody involved came out of the game jonesing for another session.

At first I was very dubious on the whole Command Counter system, and now I really like it.  My biggest complaint with TI3 is the turtle-syndrome.  Planetary Defense Systems make a lot of players very timid...a house rule making them cost more or allowing players to buy fewer might fix this issue.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After initially being drawn in by the glitz, glam, and lore of TI3, the allure wore off for me after a handful of plays. On the surface, this game appears to have it all: ships, minis, planets, races, technology, combat, politics, trade, etc.; and this is true at some level. However, beneath this glossy exterior is a design that results in disjointed, unthematic gameplay. My issues with TI3 range from the minor (the fact that all techs cost the same, the fact that planets can't be use for both production and influence) to the more serious: the wild variance in the cards (including a huge amount of "whack the leader"), the fact that the way points are scored often force you to play against your race's strengths, and that even when you do complete an objective, it often feels completely devoid of theme or purpose (e.g., "I now spend 10 trade goods;" Why? To whom?). Some of these issues would be fine in a 1-2 hour affair, but when you invest an entire day in a game, they just aren't acceptable for me. Despite having some memorable moments with TI3, I no longer feel it is worth the time and energy.

(I'm giving this rating mainly for nostalgia. I did have some good times with this, but I'm moving on.)

Update:  The downside of this game is that you generally have to play an hour more than necessary, just to crown the player that everyone is sure to win does.  Needs to have another hidden VP system.

Update: The expansion makes my former comment obsolete.

RATING: 5
Cool game but certain patterns emerge when selecting roles. I don't like the house rule of limiting the Imperial card to 1 vp because it slows the game up far to much, keep it at 2 vp and the game is more intense,  you now have a reason to beat down the person who just took it two times in a row. I now rate it a 5, it is to big and bloated.

Epic sprawling space conquest game with victory point conditions, diplomacy, miniatures, combat, a hefty playtime and a even heftier play time.

A big letdown now that I've finally played.

Well tbh I was expecting...more? It is epic in lenght, but you don't really build a space civilization, just just build a bunch of ships. Most of the tech is about giving +1 to move or to hit, not very 'epic'. The voting system is nice, but doesnt impact much and the trade deals doesn't give as much as you would expect. There is no real escalation when it comes to getting points, and round 6 did not differ much from round 2. Lots of potential, but ultimatly too rigid and dry when you consider the lenght. Eclipse and Space Empires 4X are far superior and has you actually building an empire, not just fleets.

RATING: 8.2
Good systems, a true tech tree (one of the few around) and an epic scope mostly overcomes the downtime and typical wargame issues.  The action cards and the political stuff adds a bunch of flavour but you could play without them to reduce play time - especially the political stuff which is a bit pop-gun amongst the heavy-duty space opera.  It seems to me that the epic space war game could not be designed much better than this - the problems are inherent to the genre.  The downtime is there but its not oppressive - its actually the most bearable of the 4+ hour games I have tried (and better than many 2-3 hour games as well!).  Remember the game is in the end a Victory Point race and that should be the focus of strategy, but it can result in an underwhelming end, where (for example) someone wins the game by "spending 6 trade goods".  Do NOT buy the expansion unless you are planning on playing with more than 6 people!  It is a total waste of money for what you actually need, which is the extra objectives and the Imperial II card.  Make copies of these off a friend or the internet.
-----------------------------------------------------
Current house rules:  
(1) leave out all of the technology related objectives.
(2) leave out all of the targeted action cards UNLESS you are playing with agents
(3) play Age of Empires
(4) when playing with less than 6 players, keep the ratio of total resources per player the same as with 6 players.
-----------------------------------------------------
Three point strategy 
(1) try to claim a VP every turn
(2) you will probably not win unless you get your Secret Objective
(3) if you claim your Secret Objective too early you will be attacked and won't win, so try to claim your secret objective on the turn you win, claiming a 2-VP objective as well, to go from 6 to 10.

I'll be honest; my first play of Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition was marked by tedium more than anything else. Off hand, I'd say it's like Puerto Rico in space with a handful of dice-driven battles at twice the price and quadruple the length. And somehow, there are fewer decisions to be made. Still, it was my first time through, and we were playing a six-player game, which meant lots of downtime. One of the players pointed out that you could use that downtime to thumb through all the tech cards, read the flavor text for your race, etc., but in the early game I didn't want to miss anything other players were doing, and in the later game I looked through that stuff in about 10 minutes, a mere fraction of the game's overall downtime. I have no objections to the game's lavish production; in fact, the hour-long set-up and rules explanation were more impressive and engaging than the actual game. As for the much-vaunted theme, the science fiction universe of this game is shamelessly derivative. L1Z1X Mindnet = Borg. War Sun = Death Star. Etc. Etc. Not a turn-off per se, but not a big attraction either. Perhaps the theme is meant to affirm the genre and not expand it; in that sense, it could be a place for enthusiasts to congregate, instead of one that draws a new set of enthusiasts. Ultimately I think I would like this game if my decisions arrived several minutes sooner. I'm told it's quite good with four-players, so maybe my six-hour investment will be worth something, after all.

I did not see much to love during my first play. I'd be quite curious to try a 3-4 player session of this to firm up an opinion. 

[b]Update:[/b] So, three years after my first play of TI3, we're given the thunderous arrival of Eclipse. Quite simply, if you have not played either game, you owe it to yourself to play Eclipse first. Far better pacing, far better game.

Played one game so far.  It was long, we ended up tired but it certainly shows potential for being really good when playing with experienced players.  It will be hard to find the people and the time but it will get another go sometime soon.  An epic game.

RATING: 3
Great pieces and a lot of interesting things going on, but overall I found the game too long with too many rules. Trade system didn't seem very good. Tech system was fun. Unless you love looking up lots of rules over the course of many hours, I wouldn't recommend it. But if you are looking for the super meaty version of Cosmic Encounters, have at it.

What a beast. I went into this kind of knowing what to expect, but I had never played anything like it so was definitely in over my head. Negotiation/diplomacy isn't my thing and that's a big part of this, but the exploration and role selection is cool. It has a ton in it, so I can see why people love it. I'd definitely play again.

Of itself, this is a flawed game.  By its very nature it encourages turtling and some of the wildly OP action cards are stupid beyond belief.  That said, there are ways to make it play a lot better (not, in my opinion, without homebrews - see my modpack "Veiled Incursions" for my slant on that)

TI3 is a huge sprawling monster of a game. It's the Hummer of boardgaming. More is better, no questions asked. A big boy's toy, no attempt at decency or elegance, only blunt power. For a change of style, it even mixes Eurogame VP collection in which will give the gut/experience players a hard time winning. The challenge is to stay focussed on the goals and not getting lost in the myriad of possibilities (this Warsun looks kinky, let me work toward it). It's highly variable with lots of optional rules, individualized player factions and variable setup. But its gamekit nature is a double-edged thing. While it's the guarantee that each play will be a unique experience, it sets the field for disappointments as well. My first and so far only play was 8 players, took 8 hours and had enough incoherencies for three other games together (potentially due to 8 players):
- Strategy card selection was almost the same each round. First was Logistics (take 4 command counters), second initiative, last player always got Politics. A huge disappointment for such a central mechanism.
- Political phase didn't matter much. Almost never anyone bothered to try to bribe other players to decide for them as it is close to impossible to steer a majority of 7 other players your way.
- Trade phase was boring due to Hacan dominating and reducing the degrees of freedom for all others.
- Luck of discoveries skewed the end result, admittedly to my favour.
Considering all these grave issues in an 8 hour game with lots of down time I would be surprised about TI3 rated as high as it is. But I'm aware that the majority of voters values the experience the most and is able to ignore mediocre mechanisms, downtime issues and disastrous luck to playtime ratio. I would give it another try but only with 6 players. To put things into perspective: I won this game, so this is no sore loser TI3 bashing.
6/10 as a set with the expansions.

Thought it lived up to the hype.  I'd play again without any hesitation.  EDIT 8/19/07:  Added an extra point after playing with Shattered Empires.  If you are looking for a massive, immersive, multifaceted gaming experience, look no further.  Long, but them's the breaks if you truly want epic.  EDIT 12/20/09:  I think I've now played nine times, and it's a 10, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be.

While this game clearly falls in the epic category (handles up to 8 and plays 1 hr/player or more for inexperienced players), it is a completely amazing game.  If you are fortunate enough to have 4-8 people who are willing to dedicate the time to play this game from time to time, you are in for a seriously awesome experience.  Phenomenal game.  Only drawback is the time it takes to play.

Fighters are too powerful, so races with better fighters are the best.  Other ship types are marginalized.  To fix: the destroyers should be enhanced to easily mop up fighters, then the bigger ships would be needed to mop up destroyers, and of course fighters would be needed to mop up the bigger ships.  This would restore ballance to the universe...

This is a stellar game. Pun intented (if that is indeed a pun) I love this game but we have some house rules to make it slightly longer but not incredibly long. Our house rule is that the Imperial card only gives 1 victory point instead of 2. This allows us to get a bit more technology and doesn't make the game overly long.

Wow, people have said this game is "Epic". Now i know why. Took me two large plano boxes and i had to really scrimp to get it all in there. For now my goal is to find four other people willing to invest 5 hours on a game!

Playthoughs with 3 were fun. If people plan ahead this game flows well. If you are playing with people that dont or can't plan ahead move to another game. The first "Oh it's my turn Hmmmm..." will be a good clue to pull out Tickey to Ride :P

Interactive strategy tiles so players may play when it's not their turn. Lots of facets to the game besides building and conquering. Well designed and was always a game to look forward to playing.

Major drawback is that it's not for light gamers: [b]lots of rules and long playing time.[/b] So it's hard to get a game going with friends.

Okay, I haven't played this game in over a year. I was craving to play, but realized that I too have transitioned my gaming experience. TI3 is [b]really slow especially with the expansion rules[/b]. Never realized how important the ISC card is in the game. Victory points simply take way to long to obtain. Even when you decimate an entire army, there is no points rewarded, in fact most of the time you'll get ganged up on by 2 or more players and fall into last place.

Strategy is limited by the swarms of units. Really comes down to luck rolls. Political cards and tactic cards have minimal impact on the game. And of course, objectives are either far too difficult to obtain or far too easy that everyone gets them.

Although this was my favorite war game ever, I've grown to realize how [b]monotonous and belaboring[/b] each turn is, especially if you are most certainly out of the running. All you can do is prolong the game or prevent someone you don't like from winning, while you hand the victory to someone else. 

Truly disappointing experience, especially with seeing a sneak peak of how the new Strategy cards work. Shows me the direction in which the game is progressing, apparently the opposite direction I am going.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent space exploration game. I'm not sure about the epic feel that gamers talk about when referring to this game, but there are many ways to develop your alien race and many ways to achieve victory.

If you try to learn the game with some Axis and Allies and Puerto Rico experience, its quite simple. And once players learn the strategy cards, the game moves quicker and is less prone to downtime.

Played three six player games and definitely no more. There are a few moments in the game that are fun but it is mostly torture. There is this illusion of strategy - most of the important things in the game come from random card draws and action card plays as well as dice rolls. There are so many better games you could play so many more times in the eons it takes to finish a game of this.

RATING: 5
played the basic game, but found it an underwhelming experience. The rules are epic but it shows that Euro mechanics do not a Eurogame make. The many added levels of complexity do not necessarily influence the game that much. The problem is structurally the same as in Risk. Grab land and build up your forces. Nothing in the game arranges player interaction. 

Although the strategies' mechanic is borrowed from Puerto Rico (and others) it is fundamentally different. Each role in PR resolves one of the steps in the production proces and therefore the order of play of the cards is crucial. However, the roles/strategies in TI mostly set the order of expansion, while production is largely independent of the   strategy. I will elaborate at some point when I've worked this out more fully. Feel free to send a message.

I only have one play of this game, so take this initial review with a grain of salt. A lot of good choices to be made, and definitely epic in scope, but I can scratch the same itch with a fourth of the time investment. Additionally, the absolute necessity of selecting the 8th strategy card (and the 1st the turn before it) is a huge problem for me. I realize it drives the game toward 10 victory points, but it's completely artificial and provides far too great a benefit in the long run for the player that selects the first role on the first turn of the game.

Based on 3  plays.  The many virtues of the game are offset by the imbalances, tendency to turtle, and unseemly duration.  The Secret Objective cards in particular are a crap-shoot, yet can often be decisive.  There are too few encouragements to combat, which tends to be an ugly internecine affair.  The downtime, though not egregious, still isn't pleasant.  Despite the beautiful and strategic trappings, it essentially plays like a suped-up version of Nexus Ops.  It has grandeur, yes, but afterwards I don't feel particularly awed or satisfied - just exhausted.

Huge epic space game. Mix of Puerto Rico (choosing ability each round and getting the primary for your choice and everyone else gets to do the secondary action), Settlers (modular hex board is setup differently every time and resource gathering and building) and some type of war game with dice combat. Very long game, but also very fun through out. Endless replay value since there are so many different races with different powers and the galaxy (modular board) is setup different every time and the card stacks are huge, you won't see all the cards in one game, not even close. 
Very long game, with 6 players it could take about 8 hours to play.

Reduced score from 8 to 7 after playing the base game without any expansions.

I want to like the non-expansion game more. Mechanically I like it more but it feels like it has more problems. The expansions tend to make me like the game less... I'd rather play eclipse.

Fun game for 3 or 6.  Haven't tried it with different number of players, might not be as good due to the layout of the map.

Role selection, hidden objectives, VP based victory conditions, different races with different tech tree advantages, it's all here.  The fleet limitations and role selection make for meaningful decision every turn.  It's a race to accomplish your objectives and score victory points, so turtling is not a good strategy in this game

The marriage of trash with recycled trash.  Take the most common elements of Euro games, i.e. role selection, resource management and slow development on a hex map and balance them poorly with some dicey trash stuff, then add some pretty generic looking plastic bits and make it last for five anticlimactic hours.  I've been told that this game makes one feel like a power player in some convoluted intergalactic novel, but to me it's the greatest example of a Sisyphus experience in gaming that I have ever been a part of.

RATING: 5
In a multiplayer game of this length, I need to be convinced that the experience is worth it.  The game needs to be balanced, and any major luck-based elements need generally to even out somewhat over the course of the game.  This game screams imbalance to me, and so it is hard for me to commit the time.  I'd rather play three shorter, better games.  For a game of this length that works, I suggest Dune.

Space, exploring, building an interstellar empire. You are talkingMaster of Orion in boardgame format ?! That's my kind of game. Simply perfect (for me). Vide scale of posssible actions and strategies, nice artwork. It's an instant classic.

Big, dumb fun. 
The good:  great value for the money, lots of eye candy, nice mix of other games (PR/SJ for strategy phase, tolerable roll-to-hit mechanism, some Cosmic Encounter-like rule adjustments for races and political events), and the biggy -- lots of randomness without much luck involved.  The bad:  overlong unless you have a fast-playing group, requires many players willing to invest a considerable amount of time, doesn't require much deep thinking, for all that's here there is no discovery aspect to the game board, interplayer negotiations are limited (especially compared to the likes of Struggle of Empires), and one of the races we used seemed particularly ineffectual (The Emirates of Hacan) and another overly strong (Universities of Jol-Nar).  Like others have said, our game ended just as it was getting interesting.  A fun experience, but one unlikely to occur often, if ever again.  If this design had been a computer game, it would have gone straight to the discount bin.

I'll always remember the time a gaming friend of mine insisted on including every expansion and optional rule in a first game for 8 players and we proceeded to only get through 2 1/2 turns in an entire day.  Henceforth it was really hard to get anyone to ever play again.  But I simply do not know of a better 4x game and I've tried most all of them.  This one really gives the best feel all around of epic scope, multiple paths to victory, and so on.  You simply need to be careful how new people are introduced to the game and it can still be finished in 3-4 hrs just like the box states.  I don't own the game any longer because it was never my copy anyone chose to play with but I'd look forward to any opportunity to join someone else's game of this anytime.  At this point I haven't played the game in at least 3 years though.

I just don't know where to start.  TI is a truly epic game - in size, length, scope, and theme.

It's a great combination of civilization-building, negotiation, and conflict.  [i]And[/i] it has tons of really cool goober...

[b]My thoughts[/b]: 
Best with a slight tweaking. There is one flaw to this game, the Imperial card, and that's about it. The expansion strategy really fixes this problem. Two words: War Sun. But, seriously awesome bits and cards and player race sheets. Would probably give up my entire collection and keep this if I had only one choice. So much variety and tension.

Played Twilight Imperium for the first time with 5 players using both expansions and a bunch of house rules.  I am a huge fan of Game of Thrones 2nd Edition (Christian Petersen design) so I had high hopes for TI3--I even held the expectation that this could become my new favorite game.  We played for about 7 hours and then called it when the only experienced player at the table clearly had the win.  Afterwards, I was spent and felt like my brain had been hit repeatedly with a 2 by 4.  

This is the most over-designed game I have ever played.  Tons of rules, tons of exceptions to those rules, tons of complexity tacked on to complexity with little thought to whether the additions pay for themselves by adding game fun.  Coming in as a new player I was simply overwhelmed, couldn't keep track of everything and gave up trying.

The guts of the game, the combat mechanic, is decades old Axis & Allies:  roll 1 die per unit and score your number based on unit type to inflict 1 casualty on the enemy.  Dreadnoughts and WarSuns absorb 1 free hit before dying just like battleships in A&A.  Planet invasions are like amphiphious assaults, etc...(*yawn*)

Reviewers have said playing TI3 gives them the feeling of having experienced an epic space story.  I felt nothing except brain burn.  TI3 is like the first draft of a thousand page novel published as is but in need of a five good rounds of editing.  There is possibly a good game trapped inside this sprawling behemoth, but until some of the overwhelming detail is stripped away, I won't see it.

I'm not a big fan of the objectives system either.  Conquest is undervalued with victory points awarded for arbitrary accomplishments.  

Okay, maybe I'm being too harsh.  After all, it was only my first play.  I definitely think my rating would go up with additional plays.  I suspect there is a huge learning curve with the game and until you master the crushing detail, it will be difficult to implement a well-informed strategy (which is a great chunk of a game's fun for strategy geeks).  I will not write off TI3 just yet.....

I am simply amazed at what this designer has accomplished with this game.  I have never seen or played a game that combines simplicity of play with as much character and depth which is the hallmark of american games.

I dig.

Ugh I don't know how to rate this one. You can tell this game is a labor of love, and a game where most people will love it or hate it. Extremely lengthy space exploration with diplomacy.

Sometimes this game gets compared to Eclipse but the games are not alike at all. I'll play Eclipse over this anyday.

Mine is still in wrapper but played a friend-of-mine's version. One of the best games I've ever played. Improved tremendously over the 2nd edition, but the only problem with it (and so many other games) is it takes too long to play therefore we don't play it much and then when we do, we have to almost "relearn" it, and it therefore takes extremely long to play again, therefore we don't play it again for a long time, rinse, wash, repeat.

Epic, huge. Fun, but much too long for me; I had a headache after playing both times. Playing this feels like that last leg of a road trip that goes too long without a pit stop: you've had fun but you have a migraine, and you have to piss REALLY bad.

My copy is in good condition with a couple exceptions:

1. One corner of the box is slightly crushed, and is peeling back a bit.  This could be repaired easily with a small amount of archival tape.

2. Two of the carriers snapped in half while I removed them from the sprues.  I repaired them with plastic glue, and you'd be hard pressed to pick them out of the bunch.

Let's face it: The game is just not as good as you want it to be. It takes forever, has clunky mechanisms, the expansions are almost mandatory. 

I get some enjoyment out of the game when playing with the "Shattered Ascension" fan rules (check those out, if you are remotely interested into the game). But the negatives (long playtime, overly complicated, slow moving), far outweigh the positives (epic feeling, cool negotiations/political metagame). 

I hear people talking about great games of Twilight Imperium with a great story that unfolds while you play. Stories that you can talk about years later. 

Unfortunately, this never happened to me, even though I really wanted to like this game and I've tried it multiple times. Quite frankly, all I remember is having incredibly cumbersome TI games where nothing really happened after six hours of play and moments of excitement were pretty rare.

So, farewell Twilight Imperium.

If you ask me what 4X has the best depth:length ratio, I'll answer TI:3. While definitely long, its length can be one hour per player if once all are familiar with it. There are both longer and shorter games, true, and while I do enjoy those too, I always end up comparing them with this one. Shorter games usually fall behind in at least a couple departments, while longer games are almost impossible to organize.

TI:3 features the expected 4 X's: expand, explore, exploit and exterminate. But what makes it great is that it also has diplomacy and trade in spades. All departments have a very nice compromise in between depth and fiddliness. Deep enough to be both thematic and substantial without turning to be nor unwieldy nor unintuitive.

The game also features several core mechanisms which resemble those from euro games. In particular, the drafting of the strategy cards, as well as the action draught imposed by the command counters, are two intuitive and streamlined mechanisms which add a lot of depth to the game.

Sadly, its main flaw relies in one of its main pillars: the strategy cards. In a very specific strategy card, now that we are at it: the Imperial card, which grants two victory points, no questions asked. This makes the drafting more mechanical, as two cards will always be picked whenever possible: the imperial, for the victory points, and the initiative, which determines who will pick strategy cards first on the next turn. This provokes the Imperial card keeps rotating throughout the whole game, which has the side effect of granting a considerable advantage the starting player, as well as to those seated to his left. Thankfully, the first expansion, Shattered Empire, fixes this by introducing alternative strategy cards.

So, is TI:3 good? Provided you can schedule day long sessions, yes, it's good. And if you do own the expansion and address the strategy card issue, it's bloody excellent! Play it, play it, play it!

Epic empire-building wargame, which truely takes a rather long time to play (first session with 3 players required some 7 or 8 hours of actual playing time). The selection of the strategy cards is too scripted (first initiative card and next round imperial card, which gives you 2 victory points [on a total of 10, this is a lot!]). Initial set-up of the galaxy is crucial, get some interesting planets next to your home system and drop the rubbish close to the other players. Don't forget to play towards the objective cards (public and secret - although some of the secret objectives are very hard to accomplish), because only victory points matter (not the complete domination of the galaxy or most planets or most warships or whatever else). **** First session (3 player - vanilla) played (and won) with the Universities of Jol-Nar. **** Recommended to play with the expansion Shattered Empire. The strategy cards are much better and fix the higher mentioned issue! **** Second session (5 player with Shattered Empire) played (and won) with the Naalu Collective. Taking and keeping Mecatol Rex is great! **** Third session (3 player with Shattered Empire) played (and second) with L1z1x Mindnet.

(3 plays)In my opinion, this game owns its genre. To me, I just can't compare this game to others. Even though I never actually finished a game of this, I feel as though this game obliterates all other war games. Not only that, but the game handles large numbers of people fantastically and everyone is constantly thinking for the entirety (10-14 hours usually)of the game. I love to play this game, it's really more of an experience than a game, an all day event that you invite all your friends to come early in the morning and finish late at night. The reason this is not a 10 is because, even with the game (and the first expansion) the game still has some problems. The war mechanic works, but in my opinion could be redone, the amount of time it takes to play this, I think is perfect, and, this may sound a little silly, but people tend to do what is right in the game and not try to get victory points. People will role play. This is the reason the games can can on for so long (IMO). Recently, I've started to tell people before we platy that they should just think about VPs and not what is right, this can take from gameplay a little. All in all, this is a fantastic and beautiful game that fully lives up to its title.

I just wish I could play it more often and that it wasn't so damn hard to get enough people to play it... :(

Best empire building and space exploration / conquering game I ever played. Got better with every version of the game and I'm a fan of it since the first edition. But TI3 has problems too - one has been the problem with the imperial card and its two instant victory points that can be a pain in a game towards 10 victorypoints. But with the new cards inside the expansions this has changed and now TI3 is really a blast. Only thing that made me rate this game "8" instead of "10": The complexity. It is really cool to have a game where you can fight, trade, negociate, act with political agendas, use leaders, use mercenaries, action cards, laying mines, building up planet defences etc. etc. ... but at some point you have a game that is so complex that you can't overwiew all the possibilities anymore. TI3 is very near to that point or perhaps has already passed it. By making the game better and more complex from version to version TI3 has now reached a level where you can't play the game within a normal "time slot". That means: If you plan to play TI3 you must have MUCH time - about eight hours or much more with unexperienced players. It's a pity - I love this game but I have a gaming group that likes to rotate the game on the agenda each time. With 12 really good games within this rotation TI3 doesn't show up very often. And if... well, often we decide to play something else. Why this? Well, we don't have enough time, are less than five players (TI3 is better with many players, 5 and more  ), have to many unexperienced players who are not interested in such an epic "monster game"... and YES, TI3 IS a monster game.

RATING: 3.5
I've really tried to like this game. The theme is great. I love the theory of an epic space game with all these different races and space ships and what not. The rules even sound good in theory. But in practice it's tedious, frustrating, broken and fat with subsystems and mechanics that add no value.

Every time I play this game I end up feeling robbed. Robbed because despite taking up to 8 hours very little actually happened in the game and I barely had any control of what little did happen. In a typical 6 player game you will only have the opportunity to play maybe 20% of the board and will not be able to interact at all with 2-3 of the other players. It is a serious design flaw for an 8 hour game if another player can win without you having any opportunity to prevent it. 

I feel this game is also far more random than people give it credit for. Again this is a serious design flaw in a game that takes 8 hours. A huge amount of the victory points in the game are allocated by pure chance. So many of the objectives are either extremely easy or extremely difficult for certain players depending on how the board happens to be set up. The secret objectives are even worse, again they are hugely dependant on board layout but due to their secrecy you cannot prevent other players from achieving them. It really feels like secret objectives just randomly assign 2 extra points to certain players. I know that in the games I have played there has never been any correlation between the end scores and the quality of play, which is extremely frustrating. I don't want to play a game for 8 hours only to realise at the end (or worse, at the beginning) that I never really had a chance to win.

And that brings me to the huge amount of rules in this game that are either broken or add no value or add more tedium than value. The ISC is obviously broken, proponents of this game like to claim it isn't but the best argument they can offer to support it is that you need to meta game out the imbalance. It was really embarrassing when FFG stated that the card was working as intended. Everyone uses the expansion fixes for this. 

Fighters are a big problem. I accept that they aren't broken since everyone can build them but they detract from the game for so many reasons. They are so much more powerful than any other ship that any otherwise interesting decision making when building fleets is reduced. Worse still they are so numerous that they clog the board to a ridiculous degree and increase the length of every battle by 100%+. What exactly is the point of them? Everyone needs to build them yet they negate each other, the net effect is only to increase tedium. Couldn't they have just found some way to factor fighters into the inherent firepower of carriers?

The political sub system is a complete waste of time. It will only have an effect maybe once in every three games and even then it will usually be minor. This is the most obvious bit of fat that should have been trimmed from the design long before release. The action cards are almost as bad (and even more random) but I can live with them.

The command counter allocation sub system, whilst interesting in theory, is also a waste of time as it never really has an impact that outweighs the complexity and time it adds to the game. Fleet supply is mostly irrelevant due to fighters (and in fact makes the fighter problem even worse). Strategic and tactical actions are usually always plentiful enough to do almost everything you would want. I'm not saying the system is entirely worthless but in the end it just isn't worth it, I'd rather just predefined action and stacking limits at the benefit of speeding the game up maybe 10%.

I have many other small problems with the game but I think these are the most major ones. I really don't think it would be extremely difficult to design a game with this theme that plays twice as fast yet feels more rewarding. I'm keen to see a 4th edition of this game but I'm not holding my breath seeing as how far away they are from a good game by the 3rd edition.

Everything you've heard is true. Very long game (8-12 hours easy), complex rules (not difficult to grasp once you know them, but there are a LOT to know), mentally involving. BUT I would say although the game gets you to think you have to focus on battle, you actually don't--I played two games w/o fighting and won one of them, so it's possible. I really have to emphasize that comfort and space are needed for this game. We had to play on the floor (didn't have a table big enough) and after 9.5 hours on the ground, my back was killing me. I'd recommend a table big enough to fit about six Monopoly boards, and wear your pajamas or sweatpants and a t-shirt. Get ready to take breaks every two or so hours, as well.

Long, very long.

Alright game - in theory - but it's a very long, complex game that still simply comes down to everyone shouting "attack him! he's winning!!"

I'm suprised people don't put more effort into the design of these games to stop that being the deciding factor....

Played twice now an unlikely to play again. The first game was with the feeling of "this is dull but would be better once i've got a feel for it"

However, it was even more boring the second play. Simply nothing happens! Where is the fun? The 'political' angle consists of people trying to convince each other that someone else is winning. The battles are utterly dull, the way combat happens just seems to be so boring i never felt involved - just throwing dice and see what i get...

The game looks great and the concept is right up my street but the actually game play is dull. 

Drop the 'role selection', clean up the techs & make the whole thing more dynamic and it may be playable. Moving into 5 regions and fighting with 2 other people a total of 4 times over the space of 8 hours is not my idea of an 'epic space opera'. In the end it feels like one of the most boring 'euro' games i've played.

It seems that it all boils down to building up for war though which is fun, but I wish there was more to it.  And before you slap me, I know there is much, MUCH more to it.  I just don't know yet how to do all that stuff effectively.  I can't wait to play this amazing game again though to try to figure it out!

Lots of great mechanics and content. Nice.
But the unweildiness of the game, huge impact of luck, rules that favor boring styles of play and the obscene amount of time it takes make it a less than rewarding play experience.

While there is player elimination, a player who has, for all purposes, lost already in turn one or two often has still to sit out the game.

The expansion improves it somewhat, but it's still nothing I'd play every weekend.

The ultimate civilization game. It just has everything: tech research, warfare, lots of figures, trade, sabotage, ... And most importantly, the politics! Betrayal, promises, intrigues, bribes and blackmailing that pop-up in this game are more than just a cherry on top of the cake. We've had some spectacular game swings due to some well-timed betrayals or hastely forged alliances.

This is one of the most over-hyped games out there.  The theme is fun (albeit generic), and the different races create a sort of lore that draws you in...and once you're on the hook, like an unscrupulous bait and switch appliance salesman, the game delivers something very different.  Honestly, TI3 is a wounded, lumbering behemoth, staggering about blindly.  

My experiences with this game involve sitting and waiting and waiting.  If ever there was a game where an AP player could hold your weekend hostage, it was TI3.  And as a bonus, after waiting for some slow player to optimize his turn, you get to wait through a different player's filibuster around the voting.  I've made dinner, cleaned, ironed, and played 2 games of iOS summoner wars between turns - no exaggeration.  I have played the game several times because I heard such great things, but honestly, TI3 not only takes your whole weekend, it makes you angry and frustrated and provides no fun in exchange.  

The winner of the game is the player who throws his hands up in despair and fakes a date as an excuse to leave the table.  Add to that a dense set of rules in a poorly organized rulebook (which you have to reference all the time), a setup that is too big for ANY table, and an enormous box with no attempt made to provide a sorting solution, and you have a game that is so bloated that it feels like a 400 pound man squeezing into his daughter's tutu.  

Don't believe the hype, this game is awful.

Even I have to wait to be in the mood for this 4-6 hours of gaming masterpeice.  I love it.  It's complicated and intricate and varies a lot.  It's a lot like civ on the computer, and runs pretty well.  It's hard and not all the races seem like matches for eachother.  If I didn't have to teach it over and over and relearn it year after year.  It'd be a great game. :)  I still like it so 10 :P

Where do I start? TI3 is one of the biggest disappointments of my gaming career. It doesn't suck because it takes basically a day to play. It sucks because it isn't enough fun for that kind of investment and time does not fly by while you're playing. I love Cosmic Encounter and people talked me into TI3 because its diplomatic feature is supposedly as good as Cosmic but with many more features on top of it. Well.. no. That's definitely not the case here. The heart of the game is the good old "dudes / ships on a map" thing. Fulfull your secret objectives, amass your ships and move/attack. Nothing special. It didn't feel epic to me. Just long and boring. The races are cool and the minis seem nice for that era.. but wasting my precious weekend for TI3? Never again!

VERY long (6-8 hours w/ 5 players) and rather involved/tedious.  As far as war games go however, it's quite good (get the Shattered Earth expansion, even better).  The scope (both length and complexity) will drive off many people but if you can find a good group with enough time not to be rushed, this makes for epic games.  I think of it as a richer, more interesting version of Axis & Allies where you have to worry about more than strictly war.  The bits & board are super nice and the background story and theme is impressively detailed and interesting.

I finally had a chance to play to the 3rd edition after 2 years of waiting. OK where to start, let start with the good points.

Compared to the previous editions, there were some improvements. For example the planet cards prevente to used money token in order to produce stuff. This is nice and it is much more convenient to play. The hexes are biggers than he 1st edition so more space to place stuff. that's about it.

Now with the bad points. There is probably so much that I could not list them all since I'll forget a few. I'll try to start with the differences with the old editions.

TI add a lot of ressource management to the game which create the syndrome of "do something to do something to do what you want to do" instead of just doing it. It slow down the game and it distance more the fun stuff "invading, researching, negotiating" from the main stuff "ressource management".

Compared to the previous version, the turn order is totally screwed up. There is a lot of inspirations from eurogames in TI3 by using a role system like puerto rico. the problem is that it makes the game last forever. I can take 1 hour in a 4 player games just to explore and conquer the nearby EMPTY systems. Imagine when the real battle will start.

The objective based victory is also a problem to me that I first realised in nexus ops. It creates the syndrome of "everybody to their things and somebody wins". It almost feel solitaire multiplayer. The reason is because the game force you to do stuff to get VP. So all the players focus on that and the presence of other players sometimes have no importance to complete these objectives.

Now, let get into the stuff that really annoy which sometimes date from the first TI.

Ship movement: Of course which can move at different speed in space. But to move from a system to a system, you FTL drives (faster than light) which are totally different from manuver drives. In other word, during interstellar travel, ships should move at the same speed. Else you would not be able to make fleets.

Technology: Technology gives you bonus modifiers to almost any aspect of the game. Bonus which ost of the time are easily forgotten.

Fleet Supply: I understand the concept of fleet supply. But actually, it should restrict the number of fleets you have not the number of ships per fleet. Because the way you play now, you could have 20 fleets of 3 ships with 3 fleet supply which would be in my point of view much harder to manage than 1 fleet of 60 ships. Limiting the number of fleet would have promoted the effect of not being able to be everywhere at the same time.

Imperial: Of course there is the imperial card bug, which was so obvious just the first time I read the rules. I never played to actually realise it.

Diplomacy: I would loved to have a good diplomatic tension in the game to make sure you can win other ways than war. Bu there is not a good diplomatic system in TI3. It very limited what you can do or negotiate.

Initial Planet conquest: I hate some much the idea at the beginning of the game that you do not need infantry to actually control a planet. So you drop your unit, "this planet is ours" you take it back and move to the other planet. Wow!, I did not thought the people would have stayed that much loyal.

Starship armor padded with fighters: I just find it TOTALLY STUPID that fighters are there to actually takes the hit that ships should have taken. First, fighters should not be on the board. It removes the situation where you have many empty carriers. Second, there should be a capital ship rule: If you have more capital ship than normal ship, the next hit must be taken on the capital ship. In this case, it force the players to have balanced fleets.

So in general, the ideas are there (If I compare with the master of orion 2 video game) but they are just badly implemented. It also promotes on of the fantasy flight's new idea of make the people think about not fun things for no actual logical reason just to add strategy in the game (like in some euro games). That's something that happens in starcraft with the reverse order stack resolution.

--------------------------------------
Comments from 1 of my friend that summarize it all:

1st game played: He attacked other players and end up not winning the game be he had fun.

2nd game played: He did everything possible to win the game. He strictly focused on the objective. In the end he won but he had the most boring game ever.

Result: Twilight Imperium reward the players for doing things which are not fun.

After the first play with 4 people, I was a bit disappointed with gameplay.  It seemed like the game ended right when it was about to get interesting.  I guess in the future if I play again I won't put off fighting for so long.  Definitely willing to give it another run but at this point I'm certainly content to play someone else's copy!  I enjoyed the meld of politics, military, economics, etc and the action cards and political cards do add some spice to gameplay.

To be honest I am not really this games target audience. I am not a big fan of epic games. I appreciate the ones that I play, but sitting down to a 6-9 hour game just isn't my thing. Maybe it is because I have OCD, who knows? Anyway, what this game does it does particularly well. I especially enjoyed seeing how some of these mechanics were the seeds that laid the foundation for A Game of Thrones: The Board Game. The choices are interesting, and the VP winning condition makes the game seem much more open and variable strategies much more open to consideration. The components are top notch, as expected from FFG, and the graphic design is acceptable. The game is just over the top with the amount of stuff that you must manage during the game. There are fifteen different little decks of cards that you are using, there are at least 8 different types of miniatures that can control. Everything is just so much. The tech tree is interesting, and I think it was implemented in a pretty clever way. The races seem all different and have their plusses to them. All in all it was an enjoyable experience playing this game, but due to its epicness I would probably only play once every year or so. Just too much game for me in the end.

This is a very difficult game for me to rate as I feel that it is filled with a large number of good ideas but also exhibits major flaws.  The space exploration/warfare theme is excellent and the variety of options allows for a truely immersive experience.  In terms of game balance, however, it has some major flaws.  Early turn order is a massive advantage as the Imperial Strategy is overwhelmingly powerful.  The various abilities of the races are, in my opinion, not only asymmetrical but also unequal and some secret objectives are incredibly easier to achieve than others. Further the rewards of combat don't seem to measure up to the risks and perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of the game is therefore significantly underutilized.  Ultimately, it's too long for a game that involves such serious issues of balance and includes as much chaos as it does.

Complex, multiplayer grand strategic si-fi game.  There must be something in this si-fi game as a number of my geekbuddies recommend this game highly.  However, I find it quite difficult to get start with, especially with the planet activation system, whereas you place your activation marker to the destination planet instead of from the planet where the units came from.  There are also quite a number of new terms and gaming concepts, like production system, technology cards and units' capabilities for the players to absorb first.  On the other hand, combat is a matter of fighting to the last man, with combat die-roll of equal or greater than the units' combat rating.  It is fairly straightforward and bloody.  One of the strongest game feature is the randomness of this game, from the creation of the universe to the selection of public objectives, to the political and action cards with varying demands on the players.  So no two games would be the same or predictable.  The interaction among players and the races they represent is also intense and fun.  Many special race capabilities have a subtle impacts on the development strategy for the race.  You can always opt for a different strategy not in the race-specific fashion though, depending on the public objectives on the table.

Played one game with six people right after I bought it at a convention.  All of us were enthralled for the next 6.5 hours (as we learned the rules, too).  Mechanics are not too complex, but there are choices and tasks for each player on every player's turn.  There is construction, planetary occupation, politics, trade, research, fleet management, combat... this game has it all.  If you stop to think about it, you can tell a lot of thought went into these rules to make things work well together, to reward choices and tone down others.  The components are lush.  This is the best big-box game I have ever played, and I would be hard pressed to think of a more immersive, fun game of any sort for a group of people.  This one gets a 10 right off the bat until I find reasons to degrade the score.

Extremely fun game play. Interesting turn sequence system that leans toward the Euro style, and away from the typical "you take a turn, I take a turn" western game style. Although the turns can be long, everyone is heavily involved in each turn, making the game far more exicting for everyone. 

Plan to invest a few hours in working out the game setup and turn/phase/round sequences the first time or two that you play. Its not too complex to play once you get over the learning curve. But there definately is a learning curve. Loads of variety. The potential for variety in this game is such that it should never become boring, IMO.

At first glace, the game looks like 'Risk' on a 'Settlers of Catan' style hex grid map. But the game is far more multi-dimensional than Risk. The variety of race advantages/disadvantages, and technologies really makes for a wide variation in play strategies. 

One of the real game play issues with Twighlight Imperium is 'balance'. The races are not ideally balanced, IMO. For instance, I've noticed a slight imbalance in the way the game rules and combat system handle larger ships vs fighters, and this seems to give a clear military advantage to some of the races whose bonus revolve around the fighters.

Another game play issue is the huge variety of rules that are options. In one way, options are good. But it can also create a bit of havoc when trying to determine which are in play, and which are not. Also, with so many options, the game is a bit of a 'patchwork' of rules, that can really be confusing and lead to issues with game balance. I'd suggest developing a list of the rules that work well for your game group, and stick to them. Once you find a combo of rules that works well, the game should be more straightforward.

This game is definately in my top ten 'favorite games to play' list. It is however, not a game that you can play in an evening. Great for 3-4 players who have the better part of a day to commit to the game. I'm still giving it a '9.5' though, because its just that damn fun when you do get a game going.

Wow - this is another game that can't make up it's mind. With SOOO many law cards, there's just so many possibilities for the game to get 'broken.' We had that happen in our game, where, to adopt a law meant one person would def. win; and to not adopt it meant no one COULD win, without fully eliminating everyone else from the board - this happened after 5 hours of play.

Has creative mechanics no other game I played has, most notably the "living diplomacy" which means players will have to negotiate each other verbally about star system occupations, trade agreements, giving favors, and waging war. It makes you feel the weight of your decisions.
It has some negative elements, such as the 6-8 hour playtime, and the fact that it takes so much place a digital version plays better than the physical. But make no mistake, this game is legendary!

Totally epic.  The greatest thing about this game is that you remember the details of each session.  Every time you draw a different race and that totally changes your strategy.  I love this game, but will only play it with the new objective cards (which give the game a stronger military focus).

The offtimes in this game is sometimes very long when waiting for the other players. additionally the gametime could be very long.

The play secuence is nice, and the tunorder is not alwasy the same.

It is a nice game but other space games are much better.

RATING: 10
A long deep game, my favorite of all times (even when I've only played it a few times)

The tree of what you can do expands into almost infinity (and there's an expansion! Oh my god!)

This game is not for the faint of heart, the 5+ hours that you will spend playing it will be full of heartbeat-raising decisions.

Every small matter, from watching every little bit of your opponents to lure your friends to vote against a law you don't want passed, to the nail-biting combat, will make this the game of your life.

It is all: the combat of the MB games of old, the elegant design and stability of Eurogames, the decisions and strategy of a very complicated abstract and the fun of a pinball machine!

Edit: I've managed to translate, print, paste, and cut all of the cards (including Strategic) and race sheets in the game. It seemed this was my friends' cue to tell me they don't want to play the game anymore.  I guess I need a new game group

What can I say? Played this twice, both sessions well over 10 hours. It's a monster, but for some reason the game seems too *short*. There's so much packed in to it, and there's only a couple of rounds per player really.

The time investment is too great, I won't be playing this again, but it certainly is a remarkable effort.

Finally finished our first game, which was split into multiple days. Amazing game, and I have not seen anything else like it. Battles, Politics, Truces, Diplomacy. Expanding, Exploring, Exploiting and Exterminating. Amazing what could be packed into this long and epic game.  Played with parts form both expansions as well. Looking forward to trying to break it out again next winter, hopefully for just a weekend or two.

I played this in a convention. I find it to be long and tedious, although with some interesting mechanics. The worst part, for me, is that the vast majority of one's actions during the hour-long turns seem to have little to no impact on the actual score. I rate it this low because, while conceptually it is not that bad, the 8-hour play time is simply offensive considering that out of those 8 hours, maybe 20 minutes in total have any impact on your score. It is essentially broken due to that reason.

Played it at 4 players, 6 players and 2 player variant. 

4 players was alright, but allow people to stay in their corner and build their own thing and still win the game.

At 6 players, the game shines best and it was a lot of fun. We used Imperial 2 strategy card instead of the one from the base game. It changes the dynamics of the game. 

Both 4 and 6 player lasted 8 hours. Although they were all first time players. It is about 1 hour per player.

Below is not part of the official rule:
We wanted to get the game on the table more often, so looked up on the 2 player variant.
It is excellent. The political play is a lot of fun. this variant.

RATING: 10
Easily in my top two games ever played - especially with both expansions (the other one is Descent (1st Edition) with expansions). The Centerpieces of this Game are not the really well combinated mechanisms or the great artwork or the nicely balanced races (at least after two expansions). It is much more the extreme amount of communication, negotiation and the nearly unlimited possibilities to interact with each others (or better with other civilizations) that make this game really special. This game makes you actually be an individual of a foreign race and lets you act like so. 

Playing time is dependend on the options you play with and of course the strategy and objective cards you chose. 
This is the single game that players still talk about weeks after a match. Just a class of its own - outstanding.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The strategy cards (same as the roles in Puerto Rico) need a lot more synergy between them to work.  The political card is a particular disappointment.  Unfortunately (due to the IP card) I have players in my group that have stated they will never play this again.  Unfortunately for T3, Nexus Ops moved it's cheese quite a bit and what's more, I feel Second Edition is superior.  I have no clue why this is ranked so high. Nice plastic pieces that obfuscate a rather tedious version (much like Axis and Allies)?

Comments entered on 13 Dec 2010:

This is the third iteration of the Twilight Imperium board game. The first two were variations on the American style board games with an I-go/you-go turn mechanic. The third edition borrows the role selection mechanic and involves a threaded turn structure and makes this game significantly different and far more interactive.

I purchased the first edition of this game when living in Moorhead in about 1997/1998 and never played it. I purchased the second edition of this game while also living in Moorhead and never played it. In January of 2005 while working at Paradox in Fargo, I bought the third edition and then ran several events at the store of the game. This was FFG's first "big box" game and is still one of my very favorite games.

I have the base game and the Shattered Empires expansion.

Roleplay an intergalactic power - fun!

A lot of work is required to prepare this monster.

The play time can go long or short. To go short, get into the theme. To go long, try to win; I'll be hoping you get some hoser card along the way.

There's so much to this game that it deserve the title of epic in full.
All things play nice together and the experience is amazing.
Only one little thing: there is a bit of randomness especially if you add all expansions together: action cards, political cards, the way the galaxy is assembled, the objective card (secret and public), might give you in a very tough start while your opponents may have a easier time.
Highly recommended to try it at least once.

Very long but huge fun.  Exceeded my expectations, which were pretty high.

I was very surprised how well the game held everyone's interest for an extended 12-hour marathon first game (for all 3 of us)!  2nd game (with 2 newbies and two of us on our 2nd game) lasted 8 hours (until one player reached 8VP, but we kept playing) and an additional 4 hours (until that same player reached 10VP, with the rest close behind).

Reminds me of Sword of the Stars, one of my favorite computer games.  I especially liked the many opportunities the game gives for deal-making among the players, sparks lots of interesting conversation and trash-talking :-) 

We've played over a dozen games since.  Average game (5 players) now takes us about 6 hours, plus an hour for setup and getting organized, and including a meal break.  Still my favorite game.  Have a core set of players who enjoy this so much that we are getting together about once/month just to play this game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The game is a battle between very different factions in a space setting.  It is big, complex and a sprawling 4x game.  It takes more than 1-2 hours to teach.    

I found the game to be far too long.   At larger player counts you are taking forever for your turn.  Depending on player numbers and expansions, you are looking at a 6-16 hour game.  I don't mind 6 but I don't want to go much longer than that.  It really is not that great for 12 hour investment.  

I really would recommend that most people don't buy this.  You are going to have a tough time finding people to play.  If you have a game group that likes event games where someone serves meals while you play, it may be ok.  Just not for me.

A blend of Settlers, Puerto Rico and Risk game mechanics masquerading as a monster-space-combat-empire-building game.  A not completely unenjoyable way to burn 6 hours all the same.

On the whole, I'm not likely to play it again even though I like the genre and concept.

It took a while for me to figure this one out. Very heavy compared to my normal fare. I enjoyed the game and would play again though. It's very easy to be forced out of contention by the layout of the board and the objective cards you are given. However sometimes you can claw your way back out of such a situation. This is an event game, plan the date for this title well in advance and make sure everyone understands the length. It helps to make a rules document and see that everyone has a copy before the game day. Plays differ from one to another dramatically. Sometimes it'll be a tight race sometimes it'll be a blowout but for me it's always worth the effort to play if I've prepared to play it. Note: with the Shattered Empires expansion nearly all the points that make me waffle on this title evaporate. This is an excellent event game with the expansion. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I great game with lots of strategic options. Not a difficult game really as it keeps repeating itself over and over once you get use to the turn structure. Battle system is OK - a little simplistic, but that is a minor quirk. A think a little more thought could have gone into the combat (imho). Although it says 3  players - the 2 player varient (see forums) plays fine and takes about 2-3 hours - sometimes faster.

Comparable to Eclipse; both have their pros and cons: rating wise they are equal.

I'm playing it, but I feel it's boring. I'm a defensive minded guy (I think that the best defence is... a fully manned double-deep trench line!), so with this kind of multiplayer games I wait that someone else start a war, hopefully with other people. Offensive minded players can like more the game because they actually do something during the turns. The 6 is for the really high quality of all the material stuff. I play the former version and I think that is is somewhat better, even if I feel that some new mechanics is simply put here because in other games work well (e.g. Puerto Rico)

This game takes a long time but captures the epic scale of a SF novel. Let new players be warned, the hundreds of plastic ships and technology upgrades will put you into a mindset of total annihilation.

TI (plus the first expansion) is an amazing, epic, experience. The races are not balanced, and you can get hit by bad luck early, but the game is so much fun to play one tends not to mind too much. Where you'd have had more fun spending those 12 hours playing 3 other games is a moot point; these days I play Eclipse much more often than TI just because of available time. Where it really scores over the likes of Eclipse is with the variety and theme added by the Galactic Assembly, where players can effectively vote to change the rules as the game progresses. You do need that first expansion to address some rules issues.

Getting this beast for Christmas too.  I want a huge space opera and what better then the granddaddy.  I thought about investing in Eclipse or another 4 X space game but then thought, if Im going to spend the money and play a game for four hours Id rather just buy the biggest baddest game in the genre and play it for 6-8 hours.  It won't hit the table often, but when it does it will be an event.  And hosting a huge saturday afternoon evening TI3 event is part of the appeal to me.  Really looking forward to learning and playing this bad boy.

Update:
We've gotten this game to the table four times already.  Three three player games and one four player game.  Lots of fun, everyone really enjoyed it and we will be playing it as often as possible.  In our most recent game we were able to reduce the time needed considerably so the worry of time commitment hasn't turned out to be a problem.  That being said, still waiting to play it with 6 players.

What can I say? I like deep involved "social" games with lots of things to do... TI is the epitome of this gaming style. It is defined as "dynamic" and "big picture" -- it is indeed, all of that and more. The lower rating is because of game length and the number of random surprises. It takes a long time to play -- we used to play 2-3 times per year, but now we're lucky to get in one game in two years. It's well worth the effort if you can find enough players. Six players is the ideal number, though the game is good with four. This game is all about player interaction, but the time factor estimate of 1 hour per person only works if everyone knows the game and stays on topic. After six hours, this game tends to get tiresome. The Shattered Empires expansion is a must. The Shards expansion isn't, but it's not bad.

Combined with Shattered Empires expansion, this game is absolutely fantastic with 4  players ALL the time.  It does require a time commitment, which can make it hard to organize a large game.  TI3 Wiki is a great alternative to actual tabletop play (you'll need the game do to this however).

Sadly, despite having good ideas, it has the problem of playability. If you arrange the game to 10, but also 14, points, you don't ever go over the third tech level. Then, why a list of all these tech advancement? If you go to play without the points restrictions, you must eliminate the other opponents, that for a modern boardgame it's a nonsense (I play with my friends for fun and stay togheter, not for pull out of my home).

The ultimate game, but for me, ONLY with the Shattered Ascension house rule set from PsiComa (only the base game without expansions I'd probably rate a 4). I'd like to spend most of my waking hours playing this game or talking about it.

Every game is an epic struggle, inspiring great war stories and "what if" scenarios. The game is massive both in scope and playing time, but those are not negatives for me.

The biggest thing I can say is that although I always play to win, in this game "the journey really is more important than the goal". Even if I lose badly, I still have a lot of fun and memorable moments.

Twilight Imperium Third Edition is an epic empire-building game of interstellar conflict, trade, and struggle for power. Players take the roles of ancient galactic civilizations, each seeking to seize the imperial throne via warfare, diplomacy, and technological progression. With geomorphic board tiles, exquisite plastic miniatures, hundreds of cards, and introducing a rich set of strategic dimensions that allows each player to refocus their game-plan, the original designer Christian T. Petersen has seamlessly incorporated the better qualities of other recently popular games to improve on the game-play of the original TI, making it at once perfectly well-rounded and pleasantly familiar to experienced gamers.

     My favorite game.  Rather long and horrifyingly slow if Analysis Paralysis is present. Epic space game with politics, diplomacy, warfare, resource gathering, loads of races to play and technology development that keeps it from being stale with different objectives, rule manipulating action cards and political mandates that are voted on by players.  The 3rd edition really shines with some innovative mechanics. Christian Petersen's finest outing.

RATING: 9
The incredible components together with the brilliant resource and movement system would place TI3 at a rating of 11, but the time investment and some baffling design choices (ISC and some of the action cards) reduce it somewhat. Our games so far were with Age of Empire and  the ISC with 1 point (or 2 if holding Mecatol Rex), which seemed to work out rather nicely and will probably remain our set of variants for now.
Played thrice.

This game is very visually impressive, but in actually gameplay, it has a combat system similar to Axis & Allies and a job / role system similar to Puerto Rico. It has so many pieces and rules that play can be very lengthy to receive the dubious reward of Axis & Allies type combat. Not a bad game, but I don't think it's worth the monetary investment required to purchase it.

RATING: 10
Ti3 as a game with out the Shattered Empires expansion if a flawed experience. (i would rate it about a 7) The 10 reflects the fact that I never play this with out the SE expansion. With the new Rules and objectives this is truly the best space expansion game available today. Sure it is long, but if you are worried about time then go play something else. If you are looking to play an excellent game of science fiction empire building then clear out a Saturday and invite over some friends. 

the game plays well with 3 - 8, 3 and 4 player games take about 1 hour per person once everyone know the rules (I would say by the 3rd play). 8 hour games are going to take you from 8 - 10 hours depending on how fast the group plays.  To really enjoy this game you need to have the flexibility of not setting a time limit, but on those occasions that you can do this it is time very well spent.

A gift from my 2012 Dice Tower Secret Santa!

I have played a 6 player game once with my gaming group with the Leaders mini expansion, which adds a lot of theme to the game.

Out of my 5 friends, 4 were total noobs and 1 had played before, but needed to be refreshed a bit.

I started explaining the rules to everyone at 11 am, finished at something like 12h15 and we went to lunch.

After lunch, we started playing at about 2h45 pm and the game ended at 11h45 pm, about 9 hours from its beginning.

Despite of its gargantuan lengh, we all had a blast, loved this game and are all looking forward to playing it again.

Some of my friends suffer from AP, and the game's tactical decisions seemed to worsen it. If it didn't happen, the game would probably have lasted for "only" 8 hours or so.

This is the most complete game I have ever played, and I would easily give it a 10 if it were shorter.

Update: I have integrated both the expansions to the base game and, OMG, it seems its rate will skyrocket! I'm just waiting to play it to give the feedback. Will it be my first solid 10 on BGG?

Update: the game is much, much better with the expansions, but there's a lot more going on now, and it causes some players in my group to have even more SERIOUS AP issues. This has caused us to be dragged to a game which started at 12:30 and finished at 23:00. 10 hours and a half of play time.

In spite of being unable to give it a 10, it has become my favourite game so far. It is absolutely great and will always be my first choice if I have time and quorum to play.

RATING: 8
An epic space game that is complete with the 1st expansion. It maybe too epic and wish my friends and I had more time to play. It has everything you could want in a game.  My only dig, aside from time, is I wish there was a little more combat b/w each player.  If not careful, combat can severely cripple you and you'll miss out on getting objectives, which is what the game is about to win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Everything I need for an epic game! Development - Exploration - Battles - Conquest - Politics tied with the excellent "Puerto Rico" mechanism and great components by FFG. My favorite and probably this will never change. 

THEME - I love 4X games on PC like Master Of Orion 2 and this could be its tabletop version. 10/10 

COMPONENTS / ARTWORK - No other company has the quality of FFG 10/10 

RULEBOOK - As always, FFG has detailed rules and examples. Plus you get a lot of flavor both in rulebook and race sheets. 10/10 

FUN - In this game, I don't care about to win. I like to see my civilization being developed. 10/10

ORIGINALITY - Strange but there aren't many space empire building games out there. 9/10

MECHANICS - The blend of euro, war and ameritrash games as good as it gets! 10/10

DURATION - The cost you have to pay in order to enjoy such an epic game! I think 5 or 6 hours for such an epic game are normal. 9/10 

REPLAYABILITY - What? With random setup, 14 races (using expansion), technology trees, laws, variants etc. are you worry about replayability? 10/10 
  

Also own Shattered Empires expansion

8.0 Rating

Rating is from first game. I really had fun with this. The game is changed fundamentally in a few ways and I'm not sure if i'd say it was better or not than the original(s). I loved the new aspects of the game (the Strategic Command Choices, reduced costs, new units, Varied Victory Points, ect...) but there is a tradeoff in scope. No longer do you have to worry about an opponent launching a full scale invasion in one turn before you can do anything to stop him. He can launch 'part' of one, and then you'll get the chance to react. He may then continue his assault on successive rounds with you responding inbetween each. There is a certain 'telegraphing' of moves that changes the feel of the game overall. "Oh great, N'Orr has chosen the Warfare Strategy". You then use a Tactical move to build new ships to deter him before he can attack (provided you have the lower initiative Strategy). Although 'streamlined for less downtime', the game is not really any shorter. I'm going to rate this an 8 for now. Great game, but I won't be selling off my 1st Edition copy.

I originally gave this game a 5 just because I have some friends who love it and I thought I'd throw them a bone.  Then I dropped it to a 4 because, well let's face it, I don't care that much.  After thinking more on it I decided to give it a 1.

This game SUCKS!  It is 95% down time waiting for some other chode to make his move.  Everyone talks about the awesome political intrigue the game has to offer.  BS!  There is as much political intrigue as a middle school student council vote.

After 8 hours we weren't even close to finishing the game.  I found myself on my phone all day waiting for my next move.

DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS GAME.  SERIOUSLY!  Save your time and energy.  I just got my wisdom teeth pulled about 5 days ago.  I would gladly have the surgeon put them all back in and re-remove them before playing this crap again.

RATING: 6
The game is a huge collection of pretty standard things seen in 4x but does them quite well.  The problem for me is just that the whole thing is way too convoluted and doesn't actually lead to that much fun play. The point scoring mechanism is a bit dull and feels stupid. The laws are potentially interesting but played out incredibly dull with no impactful law ever making it through. The diplomacy aspects in general provide awful ways to just gang up on the leader and bicker for hours about tedious stuff like how many trade goods to give to for allowing others to make a trade deal which often doesn't even do anything.  

Overall it's just so convoluted. A 9 hour game where you do like 9 turns and too much time is lost on petty diplomacy,  trading and what not instead of the fun bits. 

It is better than most 4x? In many systems yes,  but overall i rather just play 4 medium games than one of this.

Must play at least once or twice in 2013 - Have I finally found the holy grail of epic boardgaming goodness?  More play will confirm the initial impression after 6 games.  Surprisingly MORE simple to play than I expected, and it seems more consistent than my beloved Starcraft.  Some random elements can be slightly frustrating but it seems good players can plan accordingly and rise to the top.  I would NEVER turn down a game of this.  It's main problem is that it is a 3+ player game, so you need many dedicated gamer friends to make this work, wich is not my case.  I rarely have the occasion to play this, while I can play Starcraft with 2.  I noted that our 3 player game could last around 2.5 hours wich is perfect, but lack a little diplomacy that would be present with more players.

RATING: 10
After 6 4P games - My kind of game, lots going on, too many decisions, aggressiveness in all areas - not just military.  Just an all around classic (like Runewars and Starcraft).

I suspect that this is the perfect 6P game.  Going to have to try it ASAP.

Does not work well with 5P.

After a couple of dozen plays I still really like the game. This is the definitive epic space political game.  Want more combat - Starcraft is the way.

Rating raised to 10 as I simply desire to play anytime I can.

So close to being great and FFG yet again prove their inability to get things right. Long errata, clear lack of balance, mistakes on every single player sheet, pointlessly large box yet no storage compartments... i mean come on i paid a lot of money for this. 

I like the theme though and with a few house rules this can be a decent game. If i have 6 players willing to game for 5 hours though i can think of better things to put on the table.

If the game went quicker would be my only 10.  This was the game that introduced my game group to board games and we love it, but at the same time its difficult to complete a game.

If I didn't have a perfectly wonderful life away from boardgaming... i'd play this all day, every day.

*NOTE* To be worth eight, you need to play with the official Imperial II variant, which you can download from the FFGwebsite. With the Shattered Empires expansion, this is worth a solid nine.

Although not much can match this game for sheer epic scale, be prepared for a long sit in with this one. The unapologetic mishmash of chrome and Euro-style strategy rules results in a game of quite astonishing tactical variety where the path to victory is never obvious. The circular nature of the board, political and trade mechanics and objectives system combine brilliantly to ensure that this is a game which rewards negotiation without allowing it to dominate.

FUN: this is the ultimate epic SciFi boardgame.

UNIQUE: this game has almost every aspect of empire building, warfare and politics in one package.

NEGATIVES: it’s still extremely long, has a steep learning curve and the luck factor is quite high for such a game. Yet, this got played and liked more than I expected.

This game has elements from many others that I enjoy very much and manages to combine them in a very good way. Epic feel, can be won competitively in various ways, fairly simple rules, nice components, great theme and allows for eight players!

Improvement over TI2, but still too long, too random (with cards adding too much chaos) and too fiddly to come out again with my game group.  It takes far too long for anything to happen, too.  Shame, it's a beautiful game with fantastic theme.

With a couple more playings, this could become our staple multiplayer game for the next several months.  The number of races, political cards, technology, and many decisions available for the players make this game replayable.  My current gaming group has decided that no modifications or varients are needed at the moment and it's fine to play right out of the box.  The rules may seem daunting, but after a quick few turns so everyone can exercise the rules, things fall into place.

2 kg of plastic figures should be enough but it isn't completely. With standard rules this game ends way too quickly. You have to use some of the official variants and your own house rules to make this good. Still, it's way too often an arms race instead of a galactic war.

Epic game.  Epically long.  Epically complex.  Great theme and components though. But too much for me.  Interesting choices, but ultimately this game just makes me want to play Eclipse more (which is faster, and more fun).  I can see that this would be better with repeated plays, but with limited gaming time available for me, I'm not willing to invest the time.  I'd rather pay a number of shorter games than Twilight Imperium.

There also seems to be a significant luck factor in the secret objective cards drawn, as to how achievable they are.  On first play it seems to be unacceptably so, given the length of the game.  Or perhaps I just completed my preliminary objective card too late to be able to adjust my strategy :)

Played with expansion in.

Far too long, clunky and luck based for the play time. This game could be condensed down into a much better game.

Epic empire building is not my kind of game, but I respect the sheer amount of components and the feeling of actually developing a civilization.

This is a good game. It has a lot of strategy and a lot of tactical aspect about the game. But when me and my group plays it we always argue and get mad at each other. Also its too long to play on a regulat bases and I dont like the victory point system. If I try and have fun and expand my 'empire' then I lose. But if I try to win then I dont have any fun. But this game has a lot of aspects to the game nad It acually feels like you are leading an empire in a galactic war.

It is very long. You really have to set aside an evening to play it. And it isn't nearly as epic and thematic as everyone seems to think. But it is a very fun game. I've played it twice now (which is the equivalent of playing other games 8 times), and I definitely respect and appreciate this game. Solid 7.5 (I would almost never turn a game down, but I also probably won't just bring it out at a game night and request that people play it with me).

I love this game..After several plays and careful selection of the rule sets from the rulesbook, we are consistently ending the games within 4 hours with 5 or 6 players. With 4 players we actually finished it in 3h and 15 minutes with a 15 minutes break for drinks and restroom. 

Our current record was 2h 45 min with 5 players. pretty neat game. Most games are donw in 3h 30min, and a 9 player game was done in 5h 30min (while BBQing)

RATING: 3
This is an interesting game brought down by playing time and sheer weight of upkeep.  The mechanics are interesting and satisfying.  I played my first game last night, and the first two hours had me hooked.  The third hour started to drag a bit.  Hours four through six mostly stopped being fun.  And in common with the other Fantasy Flight big box games I've played, the longer you play (and the more production ramps up), the more time you spend on upkeep, and the longer the downtime between turns.  It makes for a downward spiral into boredom.  Don't even ask about set-up and tear-down time.

It's a shame, really, because the next day I was still thinking about the game and what might have been if only the Winnu hadn't taken out one of my carriers. There's the kernel of a great game buried somewhere under all the plastic bits and exceptions to the rules.

As a computer game, where upkeep is out of the players' hands, Twilight Imperium would be awesome.  As a board game, it's too long and too fiddly.  I would play it again, but I'd bring along a book to read between turns, or some quick-playing filler games for the same purpose.

I wouldn't be the one to suggest playing it, since there are so many other games that can provide similar weight and player engagement in a fraction of the time.

-----

UPDATE: Rating falls from 5 to 3 on the threat of another game.  A coworker suggested we get a group together to play this on an upcoming holiday, and I turned it down because I don't want to waste a day off playing Twilight Imperium.  I realized that not only does TI feel more like work than a game, it's less fun than my actual job.

Our houserules:

Print and laminate research guide & player aid (with variant rules).

Star by Star variant (homeworlds can be placed anywhere, each player is given an even distribution of planets/hazards)
(star by star: 36 hexes not including M.Rex. Each gets 2 obstacles/wormholes). Wormholes MUST be at least 2 sectors apart. No hope's end or mirage (+ figher or + troops planets). Muatt must start in the outer ring.

Show Secret Objectives FIRST. 

Show Age of Empire objects also. 

Custodians of Mecatol Rex.

Can choose best of 2races as well as 2 secret objectives.
Age of Empires w/ custom beurocracy 2
(6 stage 1, 4 stage 2 objectives. all initially locked)
Secret and Public Objectives revealed before setup (so you can strategize).
2 dice dreadnoughts. (only 2 dice for regular combat, 1 dice for all other)

FLEE: same as retreat, but your units don't counter attack. Instead, choose to ignore half of the hits (rounded down). Must flee to previously activated system OR place new command counter in sector that you retreat to.

Retreats are still an option for attacker (must declare before combat round).

Option: Trade Primary Ability REDONE: at the end of the trade phase, you can give AND receive ONE unused command counter to a trade partner to boost a card's trade value. Trade values can be boosted up to double their initial value.

Bonus counters give TWO trade goods (not one)

Use 3 Artifacts (use all dummies) (consider using 4 artifacts)
All homeworlds are worth 1VP (so each race starts with 1 vp). Similar to artifacts.

Play to 10VP.

Play with no Naalu and Saar

Race Balancing:
    * Give Sardakk another Carrier
    * Give Xxcha another Carrier
    * Change Winnu's race tech to 'At any time'
    * Let Mentak do the stealing right after Trade is played
    * Yssaril must pay 1 resource (or trade good) each time they pass

 * Dreadnoughts get +1 dice for regular combat (not bombardments)
    * Dreadnoughts and Warsuns lose 1 dice per hp of damage

Most rules borrowed from Shattered Ascension.

Speeding up the game:
Time limit per turn (5m). Also, please try to tell the next person to go if you are producing. (produce on the side, then tell everyone what you made and what you tapped)

Team Variant:
2 teams - random (AFTER the game is setup). 
Secret objectives are completed IF a teammate qualifies also? (think about this)

After part of the game (either after X rounds OR after someone reaches X points), there is an alliance change.

Everyone gets 2 cards - a loyal card or a traitor card. If you get 2 traitor cards, you switch teams with the other traitor. If the other team does not have a traitor, you switch with the person who is in the same rank as you (1st, 2nd, or 3rd on team).

Team rank is based off a formula (points? planets? influence?)

I was not happy with the first play-through of this one, as you really need to learn how to play it by getting absolutely trounced. On my second play--which I wager most folks would agree it starts to click a bit better--I realized what mistakes I made and played a much more robust strategy. This is not solely a war game.  I still lost on the second try, but had a lot more fun doing it.

Do yourself a favor and download the cheat sheets here on BGG. It makes the game a hell of a lot better to grasp.

RATING: 7
I'm not sure there's much point to writing a review on Twilight Imperium 3rd edition. This game is a sprawling mess, too large in scope, too long, too complex, too easy to lose in the first hour (after which there will be six to eight hours remaining - depending on the group). Or you could say the game is epic, it's a sandbox (spacebox?), a great toy that you can play with your friends all day 'til everyone is near exhaustion and are either sitting at the cusp of victory or barely eeking out a pitiful existence in some irrelevant corner of the galaxy.

When you are done, the new emperor crowned and gloating and everyone else sulking at having spent 8 hours just to lose in the end (or long before that point if they were so unfortunate), was it worth it? Yes, yes it was. The game does epic, and does it well. It is large enough to encompass all styles of play - from the min/max competitive, to the storyteller, to the guy/girl who just wants revenge for that time you did that thing, all without falling apart or feeling less because of it. And when you're done you've basically spent a day with your friends, playing, talking, drinking & eating (I certainly hope so, for your own sakes) - so it's all good!

Then you can all spent hours discussing the story that unfolded, or the strategies that worked and didn't and how you plan to do better next time (for there will be one, maybe in a year, maybe?). You don't get this investment in shorter, less epic games, and for that it's worth the ridiculous expense (mentally and monetarily) and time it takes!

My verdict: Needs to be planned in advance, but a good game, or maybe not, actually it's rather possible that this is a rather poor "game", but it's great nonetheless!

I think this game was a big step back from the earlier versions.  I don't know why it is rated so high.  It does have wonderful components, but the play is much more complex.  Adding the offices with primary and secondary roles SLOOOWWWSSS the game down so much.  Every time someone tried to attack someone else, it was stopped dead by those wonderful action cards.  It can be frustrating to build a dominating fleet to have it stopped dead by one of the many cards someone else has in their hand.  The secret victory point goals are random so you have a pacifist race with a war monger goal or vice versa.  A six player game took 1 hour per turn…ouch!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Game in a Nutshell: Explore the galaxy, build fleets, research technologies, and battle it out to gain points through different hidden and open objectives.

Played as: 6 player

Played With: Shattered Empire only

Pros: Ambitious project with many different elements of interest. Extensive technology advances and an assortment of different races with their own abilities makes for an impressive amount of potential re-playability.

Cons: The play length hurts the game because while you may still be mathematically in it for the first half (which may take the recommended 4 hour playtime on its own), if through chance, your own stupid mistake, or a combination of both, you all of a sudden are virtually out of the game, you may have to sit around for another several hours humoring yourself and others with decisions of no consequence. This creates the most painful downtime experience I've ever sat through, one of which my head was aching. I don't like the tremendous amount of things to remember at once. 

Other: Take the cons with a grain of salt because if it wasn't for the games extended play length, it'd be an undeniable masterpiece. I've rated it where I have not because I don't have a desire to try again, but the likeliness that I'll feel like spending the time for another run.

Best Use: Perfect game for a weekend at the cabin when you have lots of time to come and go.

I've played twice. Had an ok time. The chrome is appealing, but it takes so long, and just doesn't quite pay off for me. Last game, I started with a super weak position, didn't have enough resources to do much (while others spent long turns doing things) and then I won because they didn't pay quite enough attention to me taking the 8 strategy card. So, it was a bit boring for me for 6 hours due to poor starting position, yet I won. Weird outcome. 
I much prefer Space Empires 4x. Less flashy bits, but solid game play, much more focused and a bit shorter. And less waiting around during other players turns.

A great disappointment, maybe resulting in the abnormally low rating.  Perhaps over time this will drift back to the 6-6.5 level, but I doubt higher.  I had several gripes with this game which had so much promise.  The board was way too small, and remained static through most of the game as there was very little incentive to attack one's neighbor.  Our winner basically did nothing all game, and chose strategy 8 several times, and held on to a bitter end after 5+ hours.  I wanted to like the game very much (despite all the silly plastic spaceships) but it didn't make it.  I admit my preference for the much ignored Throne World.

RATING: 5
Unique strategic experience with loads of variety and interaction.  Heavy on theme and narrative.  Prohibitively long and complex, requiring the group to commit a full day for a single game.  Many small, often contradictory rules to remember.  Some parts are not well balanced.  Players can get crushed early and never catch up.  Highly dependent on table politics and prone to spiteful play.

Truly epic game of conquest and diplomacy that successfully blends Euro mechanics with Ameritrashy goodness.  Difficult to get to the table due to its long running time, but oh so worth it if you can.

The Imperial SC can give the first player a strong advantage, so it helps to get the expansion or look for the rules on the Imperial II SC and substitute that into your game.

A good big epic space game.
It's too conflict heavy for me personally so that's why it has the low rating as I don't really want to play it again.

I appreciate the systems of the game from a design-perspective, but it's just not worth the epic long play time.

Grand scale space opera; plan 6-8 hours for the game. Emulates theme perfectly; only problem with the game is playing time, which will keep it on the shelf more than it ought to be. This is the game that SM's Civilization should have been.

Fun and engaging, but I wish trading or politics played a bigger part.  For that matter, warfare, too.  It takes way too long though.  By the 3 hour mark, it's only when things start to get interesting--but I'm usually too brainfried and tired to give a damn anymore.  Way too epic.  I have never finished the game.

I play the SA variation of the game and my rating is based on that. The raw game + expansions have some issues such as very long play time,turtling and some balance issues, I would rate the standard game to maybe 8~8.25. The SA variation encourages aggression and speeds up the game alot, it fixed balance issues and adds alot of flavour to the different races.

To me this is the absolutely best empire building game out there, I would play this any time.

This game used to be a 10.
Then I got into wargaming, noticed how this game is fun, but also pretty convoluted, more about the bits and pieces than depth and strategy of play.

Especially the base game, of which most of the goals have little to do with interaction. Just a 'gather your resources' and promotes a 'if you don't attack me I don't attack you' style of play.

Very long game that requires at least 4 players in my mind.  OK with the game, the theme, but too hard to co-ordinate games.  Some issues with game mechanics and game balance.  Don't think the fun to time spent ratio is high enough to warrant future plays.

Sold spring 2008.

RATING: 10
Big game and very enjoyable.  So far the horror stories of game length have been just that.

I love this game, and it is my favorite, by far, but the difficulty in getting this game to the table keeps it from being enjoyed more.  Play it, and it will be 4-6 hours well spent.  I have no problems with the current ISC, but I can be talked into playing without it with the expansion.

Update:  The third expansion has a far better Imperial strategy card that makes owning Mecatol Rex important, again.

RATING: 7
1 play.  I totally forgot about victory points the entire game and wasn't really clear on the 8 possible roles (the winner used the "trade 6 trade goods for 2 VP's" role over and over again).  Managed to get a space nipple...er...death star...er...whatever they're called on the board but the game ended before I could begin annihilating the galaxy.  Fun, reminded me of Axis & Allies a bit, except there aren't any alliances and VP's seemed to all be based on technologies or planet types owned.  I thought the VP's seemed pretty strange, it's supposed to give variety but it ended up feeling arbitrary and chaotic.  Some people happened to have planet types required or technologies required...those that did not either missed out on them or had to steer their resources towards accomplishing them.  I also wish the political votes and stuff had come into play more in our game, 'cause that seems like it might be pretty neat.  Also, I have to say...there are way too many racial special powers.  It seemed like everyonee had 3 or 4.  Even if you are very familiar with the game, it still has to be hard to wrap your head around to try and plan around.

Outstanding game.  Will always want to play.  The issue with this game is that it is best with 6 players and getting 6 players to commit to 8+ hrs. at a table is nearly impossible.  It gets played a couple times a year, making the pace that much slower due to constant checking of rules.

This game should be played as a negotiation game. The only things you can normally actually transact are trade goods, but you can do a lot with quid pro quo. Selection of strategy cards in particular is a good opportunity for negotiation. You can negotiate for another player to leave you the strategy card you want, or to take one you don't want an opponent to get.

My rating on this one has slowly deteriorated over the years to the point I want to trade it off. I was sucked into gaming by Risk and Axis and Allies so when I saw this game years ago filled with hundreds of plastic ships and planets to conquer I got real excited. But after repeated plays over the years, I frankly find this game to be very boring. You spent literally HOURS playing this game but when you look back at the experience you find that almost nothing really happened. It is completely bogged down in minutiae and fiddly bits that just drag the game out. I used to love Fantasy Flight games because they seemed to be the standard bearer for Ameritrash games with very high production value and great themes. But I find that many of their games are in serious need of streamlining. Many of their games simply last at least an hour or two longer than they really need to for the gameplay you actually get, and Twilight Imperium is a glaring example.

----------

Feb. 2011 I traded it off for Horus Heresy. Let's hope that one holds my interest more.

RATING: 6
A very impressive game, but difficult to get in to. Lots of niggly little rules that are difficult to keep up with as you're waiting a long time between your turns when playing with rookies. Once you have the rules down though, this is a quality game, let down only perhaps by some slight imbalances that can lead to victory points for particular races that are able to exploit the varying objectives more than others. This is a good game, but I'd prefer a 2 player war game over this if the option was there.

Epic.  Play and watch the story of the galaxy unfold before you.  Clearly not for everyone, but as a sci-fi fan you can't go wrong.  Again, I like long games.

Update: Rating dropped after not playing for over 8 years.  I enjoy it, but my desire to play it is not very high.  The one session I played to completion was fun, but I just have so many other good long games like Civ, Kingmaker, Dune, or even SE4X.

Update: Traded.

RATING: 2
Take strategical actions, move space ships and roll combat dice to expand your space empire to be able to build more space ships etc, for most points.

Plays: 1.
Type: Faux wargame = a game where you move military forces on a map, but where victory isn't intrinsically about conquest or destruction of enemies.
Complexity: Heavy.
# of players: See BGG.
Playing time: See BGG.
Player interaction: Conflict and Diplomacy.
Randomness: High – dice and card draw with high impact and little control.

Replayability: Average. Those that enjoy the epic space opera theme will probably want to explore the strategies of the different races. The board is modular, so every game is very different. It’s an extremely long and very random game though. Sitting through several hours of no chance because you drew the wrong race and objectives does not inspire you to play again.
Fun: Average. Building a space empire is fun. Rolling lots of dice in space battles is fun. The interminable playing time and endless downtime between your turns is not fun. The downtime is quite remarkable considering that most strategy actions allows all players to do something. 
Memorability: High. This creates a story about space empires.

Thematic integration: Good. This is designed theme first. The victory conditions feel decoupled from the gameplay though.
Components: Not as good as one would expect. I would like better looking bits for my epic space opera game. This goes for everything – the ships are bland, the cards are tiny and the board tiles are uninspiring.

Who will like this: Ameritrash fanboys.

Amazingly long and tedious for what you get in return from this game. I even like long games and I say this! First time I played this I was involved in just 3 battles over 8 hours of game play. I have rarely in my life been as bored.

If you fall behind early or suffer a serious military defeat you can literally face hours of sitting twiddling your thumbs while having nothing to do. Not much fun being taken competitively out of a game and knowing that you still have 6 more hours to play.

Fun game, perhaps a little too complicated, but fun nonetheless.

4X games are my favorite genre.

The main detraction is the rules are written by Fantasy Flight; I have yet to find a coherent rulebook written by this company.  SEE BELOW

Fantasy Flight rules:  Explain one concept in contradictory ways among several non-consecutive pages, and among these pages leave out necessary instructions on how the rule operates correctly...put that part of the rule in with the pictured example example, but leave it out of the rule explanation completely.

There must be a game similar to this in terms of mechanics, but simplified.  I only played it once, but it seemed like 90% of the game was "setting it up" and me asking about 1000 questions about the myriad of rules, turn orders, etc (it was my first game).  I think this is as close to a 4X computer game as a board game can get...but to be honest, this game would work better as a computer game.  WAY too much tedious handling of bits, rules, turn orders details just killed the "epicness" of the game for me.  And even the epic space battles broke down to whoever had more ships, and got luckier on the dice rolls.  Way too much turtling then a mad dash for as many victory points as you can.  I really wanted to like it more than I did, but the length of game and the lack of immersion really killed it for me.  I would play this again if asked and people really needed another, but it would be far from my first choice.  Would NOT recommend to a casual gamer since people will most likely get pissed off at you for being confused and you would get bored/frustrated at the barrage of rules and administration.  I can see it can be a "brilliant game" if everyone knew all the rules to the minutia and were efficient about the chits administration but it just wasn't for me.  Not to say I didn't enjoy the game, but based on the way the ratings are worded, I'm forced to give it a 1.

After the first play or two, this game almost ended up on ebay.  After successfully pushing for another game however (who wants to take the time to sell something on ebay) we started to realize that there was actually a large amount of depth to the game, in addition to all the moving parts and fancy components.  
The game has a lot going on, so much so that its sort of hard to keep track of what everyone else is up - which to me is a good thing.  Due to its variable playing area, huge variety of victory conditions (objectives), distinct races, huge tech tree, dozens of Action and Poltical cards, and especially the Strategy cards, the game offers a rare mix of diplomacy, resource management and expansion, tactics, and strategy, and is guaranteed to never play the same. It is not meant to be a risk-like player elimination wargame, its far from it.  And if played as intended is a fun, immersive, and fairly deep game.  The game does need a little help though with the political aspects, but there are some really good posted variants for this.

Played twice in one day. Looooved it. Had heard it takes all day to play... first game with 5 players took around 3 hours. Second game with 4 players actually took much longer and we agreed to end early when 1am rolled around. Played until 7 victory points instead of 10. This game rocks! I may even like it better than Tide Of Iron. (note: I believe we were using 1 or 2 rules from the expansion)

Several older unregistered plays under my belt.

In my mind, this game captures perfectly the feeling of an epic space opera sci-fi novel. Politics, war, trade, imperialism, technology and alien civilization - it all fits together cleanly.

I think we would all play it more if it didn't take so damn long, and thus the rating will remain at 8. If I have the time and the players for something longer, GoT or Warrior Knights will probably hit the table first. Otherwise, this is a top notch title, and no other game of its type, with its theme, even comes remotely close.

The Sci fi game so many borrow from. The grand daddy. I have twilight and the expansions and can't recommend it highly enough. Of all the games me and my gaming friends play I'd say Twilight Is the biggest game to be mentioned when were not gaming. It's an amazing game, set in a universe that seriously deserves to be expanded. Some folks will tell you certain games are better (and they may be) but games in this genre 9/10 were influenced by Twilight imperium. It cast's a Metacol Rex sized shadow over the Sci fi world. The only reason it doesn't get the 10 is due to it's game  length. Don't get me wrong, we stretch it over 3 nights (16 hours) and we love every minute of it but I can understand how this could be held against it. Brilliant.

Conflicted feelings about TI3.  On the one hand, the bits are so pretty and the game promises so much.  On the other hand, combat isn't all it should be--fighters are overpowered, for example--and the board tends to clutter, especially in 6-player games.  I've experimented with lots of house rules, but eventually realized it was competing with other long games I enjoyed more.

RATING: 8
The definition of epic. Can easily take over 6 hours for a game with a full complement of players.
I love the depth of this game; tech tree, politics, trading - it's got it all.

I have heard a lot of people saying the game 'requires' the expansion to work properly, but I must say I have thoroughly enjoyed playing the base game alone. The only change we have made from the expansion was using the Imperial II strategy card text to remove the restrictive, frustrating 'game clock' mechanic imposed by the original Imperial strategy card.

I can see the game clock being useful if you really want to play the game in a shorter timespan, but the single occasion we played with it I found it simply narrows your choice for two turns in a row (or you will fall behind in the victory point league) as Initiative and Imperial make their way around the table.

By the Fists of Xxcha, this is clearly a very complicated, long game. It takes longer to play this game than to watch the sun rise over Metacol Rex. Much like the scheming neural network of the Mindnets of L1Z1T, there are too many rules. The language-heavy turn-play is like trying to read a Winnu novel. 

Still, I understand why people like this game. It's as epic as the Yssaril Tribes Civil War and the trading is more fun than market day in a rural Emirates of Hacan town. Unfortunately, as the Sardakk N'orr say, "if you have shmiznat in your qi'tkor, you better x'orr back home."

Wow, better than I expected.  Played well with three and was exciting and tense.  When played with the original Imperial Strategy I think it's a flawed game so I'll only rate it a 9.  However, if you play by the Shattered Empire Imperial Strategy II, or possibly with other variant rules, it's a pretty easy 10 for me.

It's hard to gather the people and find the time to set up a proper TI3 game, but when you do...damn is it fun. Still the definitive space opera. Nothing comes close. 9/10 only because the whole game could fit in a box less than half the size and save people some shelf space.

Two plays, and that was more than enough.  What are all these hardcore gamers and BGG veterans thinking, rating this a 9 and 10?  Is this game the equivalent of a souped-up car?  I think it is.  This could have been a great game, and I feel as if all the good reviews are wishing that it were, rather than dealing with what's actually behind the big box and pretty bits.  No game that has to be so extensively patched and then still takes hours uponb hours to play with little fun to be had should possibly be rated so highly.  In a year, I predict this game will sit on the shelf, largely unplayed.  Petersen has some great ideas, he just can't implement them well, and playtests them not at all.

UPDATE:  Bumped up a point and a half, as I'm reacting more to the BGG TI3 fantatics than to the game itself, which I would play again under some very severe conditions.

We never played it vanilla, but went straight for the Shattered Ascension variant rules, and surely will never regress to the original rules, ever. The only con would be the immense gaming time you'll spend playing with the variant rules (7-12 h). Sweating groins, big time.

Provisional rating after just a single play and I have to say right up front that I found the whole experience very enjoyable indeed.  

Sure it was a looooooonnnnngggg session, particularly being the first game for most of the players - in fact the most "experienced" had only played it once about 9 months ago!  But, what an immense, immersive, enthralling system.  There are layers and layers of subtleties and interactions, never quite enough command counters and a true sense of the universe not quite being big enough for all the races.  

The biggest compliment I can give this game is that after a single marathon session I'm dying to play it again.

RATING: 8
The classic big space opera game from Fantasy Flight from the days where they made coffin sized boxes and blew gamers away (to be fair they are still pretty damned good). 

This game has it, tech development, combat, player interaction and race based abilities. The minis are cool and it used a hybrid design to introduce Euro elements to a dudes on a map game. 

Problem is, for many people there was too much in the design and games can take a long time to play out. This is perhaps unfair on the design as it is the players that can drag out a game by 'turtling' and playing defensive when they need to be more aggressive. 

I wanted to love this but my play group was not right for it. TI needs a group that understands it well and knows how to play it (a bit like Titan) to keep the play time manageable.

RATING: 5
The 2nd edition had a lot or problems. A 3rd edition was a good opportunity to solve those problems and maintain what is good in the previous versions. That was my hope. Unfortunately the designer went a step further. He wanted to incorporate the influence from the flood of euro games. I simply don't like the result because the various mechanism don't work together and seem too artificial. Also the problem of the long duration has not been solved as the options provided for a shorter game seem unsatisfactory to me.

RATING: 10
If you never had the chance to play it, but already think Eclipse or Exodus are epic - wait till you actually see this FFG Magnum Opus in action. While it absolutely is too long for a normal gaming-session, consider bringing it out as an event on a rainy saturday afternoon. You almost can't escape jumping into the role of the race you picked, it just happens because the game supports it with every rule and game mechanic. Awesome!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
By itself the game probably rates a 5, but add in some home-grown rules and you have got a great game!  The core mechanics are very solid, but you really need the extra rules to get over some of the "fluff" rules.

My god, what a box!  So far I've played 3 games (a 5 player game that took almost 7 hours, a 5 hour 4-player game and a 7h 6player game) and boy it was fun, epic and a struggle.  The rules are actually very easy (given that it has a 44 page rulebook) and gameplay is elegant.  The pieces are just gorgeous.  Waw, this is a great game.  Epic Space Opera is the perfect description, and it deserves a high rating, but the demand on time is just too high for our group to play this... That's why I've bought Eclipse, and that seems to scratch the TI3 itch just fine... :-)

Hey, does anyone want to play Risk meets Puerto Rico in space? Except the game goes on about as long as both of those games combined times two? Sheesh, is this ever over-hyped. For being the so-called ultimate 4x game, it feels ancient in its design. 

Would much rather play Exodus: Proxima Centauri for a similar experience.

RATING: 9
TI3 is a game unlike most others I've played. It literally boggles the mind with the amount of strategic options players have at their disposals each turn, and it's easily one of the best and most brilliantly designed games I've played. I can see myself playing TI3 for years to come, and right now my goal is to play one game with each of the 10 races to get a handle on each of their special abilities and gaming styles. 

After playing the game quite a lot since it came out, I'm lowering it to a mere "9". The reason for this is mostly because there are a few more or less broken elements that, though very minor, detract from making this a prefect game. However, I feel the expansion adresses all this and more, and I give TI with the expansion a full 10.

It was great. A really great game, that every serious gamer should play. But we played a game with 8 players, none of which had ever played before, and it was very long. Very, very long.

I'd like to play with 4 or 5 people who have all played before, and then make judgement on the game. But while I enjoyed it a lot, I still like Eclipse better.

Ameritrash heaven. Beautiful production, excellently written rulebook. The game has lots of rules, but it is surprisingly easy to teach, although some AP occurs due to the myriad of options.

Nice mix of strategy, tactics, luck, diplomacy and trade. Use some houserules for map setup though to prevent screwage.

Playtime is a killer though. It can go on for 1 hour per player. Depending on the playergroup the game can tend to bog down on a turtling deathmatch.

Two plays in, I've downgraded from a 10 to a 7. It is a fun game, but it can be quite slow in the first few turns, though this might just be beacuse I've played both times with complete newbies. The roles can seem forced- Speaker is dumb if he doesn't take Imperial, 2nd chooser is dumb if he doesn't take Initiative, etc. The 1pt ISC might make this less bothersome, but the roles still seem unbalanced, in terms of what they allow and what they give the other players a chance to do.

Might upgrade again with another play, although I am no longer convinced this is the perfect game, and I no longer want to spend $80 on it, whereas before I was ready to sell organs to get a copy.

I'd had high hopes for this but was underwhelmed by the fiddlyness of its bookkeeping, the poor tech tree, the lack of wargamyness and the blantant disconnect between the things that are fun to do and the things that win you the game. It was an ordeal. Also, some politics cards broke the game and were unanymously rejected by everyone on the table who had played it before.

Possibly my new go to epic game over Arkham Horror.  However, its downfall may be that it really seems to need 4 or 5 players to hit its stride.  Playing with three found people just scrambling for the two quick points on card 8 each round.  Board also seemed too big for 3 players at that count.  Needs more of a Small World/Neuroshima Hex style map where space is at a premium.

RATING: 5
Very Good. Nice boards and bits. The rules can't be more fiddly, because the game would be unplayable. I was very disappointed after my first play, perhaps knowing a little bit more about the rules, the game would give our gaming group more fun. What a relief I didn't buy the Shattered Empire Expansion.
Out first play took about 8 hours between explanation to 4 of the 6 players, a lot of discussion about some game rules, and two VERY SLOW players on the table. I don't see this game hitting the table soon again.

Excellent: 2007/02/27: WOW... three player game, three hours. Now, you can feel how the game works. The rules are not that fiddly as I thought after the first game. Clearly, your first game after punching the bits should be a three player, get familiar with the rules, feel the game flowing, and get ready for the six player epic battle.
There's also, another important thing about this game... don't talk too much outside the game. My group talks and jokes a lot, but playing this game, requires focus on the board and gameflow to prevent the 9 hours sessions. 

2007/04/20: I hate this game when it gets played with the wrong people. You need fast decision makers on this one. I WON'T ever again play this game for 7 hours. It can be played within 4 or 5 hours and the playing group needs to be chosen properly.  With the right group, this game I still consider it awesome, but with the wrong group, I barely enjoy it. I'm not going to take this down to 8, because I still want to try the Epic Battle with fast players, no chat taking the game into LONGER sessions, and even if I prefer games in which you can make jokes or something, for certain, TI3 CAN NOT afford that.

2007/07/13: The more I play this game, the more I dislike it. Someday I will have to try the Shattered Empire expansion and see if it improves the gaming experience. This game really needs the expansion.

The ultimate game for political negotiation.  The space warfare aspect is obviously there but shouldn't take up as much time in the game as the negotiating between players each round.

Still dont have my mind wrapped around some of the mechanics and rules.  Learning the action cards and political cards are a must.  Knowing the public objective cards are also a must.

I really enjoy this game - there's that part of me that loves that epic space game thing, and this game comes closer to the mark than anything else I've seen.

There are a few problems. I'm usually against using house-rules in games, but in this case I was happy to mess with the victory conditions - I think these actually improved the game a lot. I especially recommend these victory conditions that this 'mendosa' guy came up with (Update: he's now working for FFG on the expansion, so maybe we'll see these in the official game before too long...):

Unfortunately you're in for a 6+ hour game, much of which you will spend pretty much hatching your own plans and pushing your pieces around. It looks like player interaction, but actually it's more like a convention of bond villains. Everyone sits around, rubbing their hands together and plotting their little plots.  There's not much actual action, just a lot of anticipation of action... until everyone goes crazy in the last couple of turns and someone ends up on top. That being said, it's been totally engrossing everytime I've played it, and we've always ended up hashing out the gameplay afterwards, which is always a good sign. I would probably play this baby a lot more if it wasn't for the playing time.

First play was an epic 14 hours.  The time went by fast and I never felt bored.  I love this game.  I am sure we will get the time down, half the table was new.  I'm not crazy about player elimination, I will have to read up on some house rules to see how to maybe avoid that, but it happened around the 10th hour so the player that got eliminated was happy to go home.

RATING: 7
Definetly the most epic game on the market. I wont rate it a 10 because you need to keep playing fast (else it could take up to 12 hours instead of 6). You should also explain the game on a different day than the one you play. Even a first round can be played in 6hours. Good rounds manage it to play it in 1hour per player.

Increased the rating to 10. Currently my favorite game. Play it whenever possible (which is not that often with a game that long)

Update 2016: Reduced 10->9 simply because it is too long and I can't get it to the table.

Far too slow, and far too much military "stuff" for a game where military action is generally more of an abstract threat than an actual event. Seems like replacing all the different ships with fleet point markers would have little downside and would simplify things.

Note: This rating is based on my limited experience, I've only ever played once. I played a 6-player game in which 2 friends had played multiple times, 1 had played just once, and 3 of us had never played. A 30-min how-to video was played beforehand, but I took little from it and felt about to fail a test. 
This game is fun, but not my favorite. It's not only a very long game (ours took 9 hours after set up), there's a lot of downtime between your turns even once everybody has a decent understanding of their options. No other complaints though, I think it's a very well thought out game and I disagree about it being biased against people who've not played it before. Despite being uncertain what I was doing more than half the time and making several small mistakes, I won the first time I played. My only reason to not want to play is that it is sooo long so that a day must be set aside for a single play.

Fantastic sci fi 4x, my only wish is that more of the guys were as willing to invest the 9+ hours per game as I am. I'm so obsessed that I completely rebuilt GalCiv 2 into being a Twilight Imperium PC game....
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Twilight Imperium is a majestic, sweeping mess of a game. There is beauty in the fact that it even exists, but actually playing it is a joke – and it's rendered completely obsolete by titles like Eclipse that more efficiently integrate it's various components.  

Rejected.

RATING: 6
Certainly a very good game.  It is an 8 with the caveat that it will eat up a day's worth of gaming time.  As long as you're okay with that, and can find five other willing participants, go for it.

---edit---
Knocked a point off because the prerequisities of time and number of players means you're just not going to see this at the table very much.  Sorry TI3.  I tried.

RATING: 6.5
There are at least a dozen very cool mechanics or design elements of this game, and I enjoyed many different aspects of it the three games I played. My only complaint was that its almost too much. There's so many facets and strategic and tactical paths that ultimately my choices seemed a bit arbitrary. I'm a high level game player, I'm not afraid of rigorous strategic thought. I've ogt a rack of chess trophy's and have invested hours upon hours into numerous TCG's, and long and complex board games like Civilizaton and I.C.E.'s Lord of the Rings. But somehow the trade off between the effort I needed to put in to T.E. vs. the return on that effort, divided by the number of hours required to play didn't yeild an 8,9 or 10. I think a slightly less complex version might yeild a better play experience.

That said, I would (and will) play again and perhaps I'll change my rating.

RATING: 9
I'm still questioning my own 10. It's definitely an outstanding game, which grants you a day of epic and memorable adventures. Some of the cards, however, get pretty close to breaking the game, as they may destroy someone's carefully planned - and even safe-guarded - strategy in one move. In any case, just for the experience and for the variety - of races and strategies - it gets a 10 for now.

Edit: And it's a 9. Some cards are definitely too much.

Based on one play. Although it was a long game, it didn't feel long until the last hour. But that was 7 hours into it. I was hoping for a bit more wheeling and dealing and backstabbing. I wasn't a fan of the action cards, they added just too much random to an already random game. I would play again but I would put a time limit on people's turn.

Very fun strategy game, but also very time consuming.  If you were to attempt to play this game, I would allot an entire day.  An afternoon never seems to be enough time to finish a game of Twilight Imperium, but that could also be due to my group's affinity for distractedness.  If you have a group that can stay on track, I would definitely recommend this for an afternoon of intense space combat and diplomacy.

A truly epic game that lasts a bit too long for it's welcome.  I have only played one game of this so far, but it brought up a few things that I did not enjoy.  

1. We played with the objectives available for us to look at for this particular game and they were greatly bent towards technology, which I had less of.  

2. My secret mission seemed quite a bit harder than the other secret missions out there.  

3. After 9 hours of gaming the person that waits the longest to attack gets a hearty bonus (fresh army), and on top of this ultimately the game ending decision came to the players that were not even in contention to win, i.e. if we selected these actions he wins, if we DONT select these actions the other guy wins.

Even after all is said and done this game was STILL a blast to play and I would love to play again while drastically changing my approach.

Epic game. If it wasn't for the length, it would get a higher rating. Some how I think it should be a 3-4 hour game. Just not enough attacking early on and I won the game by only attacking 3 times in very small battles. Still, I'll remember the game for a long time.

Respect! Love the oblique nature of scoring points, so unexpected to see something that looks like a Risk-style conflict game reveal such a scoring mechanic. I dug the theme and backstory, so rich. That said, I'm never playing this long-ass game again.

RATING: 9.5
Holy cats, talk about a game living up to expectations.  This "game" is the equivalent of a 80-pound Lego set: Elements of lots of other games (special racial abilities, primary/secondary role choices, political voting, the obvious Risk and Diplomacy parallels) and every sci-fi work either written or created for your computer are packed together in one messy, glorious jam, with tons of optional rules to keep things fresh (or more closely parallel your favorite universe).  In fact, you'll NEED to adapt this game to your group's tastes: Do you prefer your objectives known at the top of the game, or slowly revealed?  Do you want to make fighting a more attractive option, or do you prefer a cold war?  Do you want to make the ISC a little less powerful, or more so?  Every turn provides tons of options, all of them difficult to make with your limited resources -- you'll want to do everything, and you'll have to focus on the true objectives of the game.  Plenty of politicking and a little bit of kingmaking at the end if you're not careful.

Are none of these options attractive, and you'd prefer to play out a game based on your favorite sci-fi universe?  Look online.  Star Wars, Star Trek, Star Trek: TNG, Bab5, Dune, Stargate... print them out and go crazy.  Folks are making their own planetary systems, their own strategy cards, religious systems, deeper trade systems, and tons of other options on a nearly daily basis.

TI3 is an true epic, averaging about an hour per player and an hour of explanation.  And it's worth every second and every dollar.  I suggest playing with the base rules once, deciding what looks good in the Lego box, and seasoning to taste.

What to say about TI...if you like strategy games, then this is the best one. Deep strategy, plenty of options, excellent conflict, awesome plastic pieces, good art - there's little this game lacks. All of it's problems are about how certain areas, like the original Imperial Strategy Card, lack the awesomeness of the rest of the package. It's all subjective, but all in all, one of the better board games ever made. Oh, but it's looong.

RATING: 5
Lowered from a 9 to a 5. The game is totally broken. Depending on setup, certain races can be worse than a race with no special abilities. Certain secret objectives can actually be impossible. Its too easy for the person who knows the game the most to take advantage of new players. I've played it three times and all three games ended unexpectedly when one person who had an easy secret objective suddenly claims 5+ points in a single turn. I think the worst part is the game holds so much promise and then is always epicly disappointing in its resolution. Basically, the "game" is just a secret handing out of "I win" cards, and then we all perform a really complicated series of pointless maneuvers until the person plays their "I win" card. I can imagine that in theory this "I win" card might not be dealt and the game could be amazingly balanced and a ton of fun. In practice, this happens rarely if ever. And its LOOONG.

RATING: 6.5
It has some posible balance issues with planet tiles placement, first players, and so on, but even if some players might get an "unfair" advantage, that does not make them winners automatically.

The game is fun, enjoyable, not deep, but it's very long, and we always spend an undecent part of that time navigating through the rules, somthing you can't avoid unless you play it very often. That's way too many time for the entertaing value I get from the game. 

There are some other issues, like being forced to chose the Imperium/Initiative card, or the the first players get an unfair advantage, being able to use it more times than their opponents. Some of this issues could be houseruled, but this is someething I don't like to do in games, unless I play them very often (something that never happens with any game).

The game components are very good. I can only complain about some units being too similar to others.

Overall, it's a nice experience, but one that I'm not willing to repeat often, because of its excesive lenght.

The ultimate wet dream for any sci-fi strategy enthusiast.  The theme covers pretty much every galactic standard icon (space stations, battleships, different planets and races, etc) while the game mechanics offer something for every preference (territory expansion, space battles, special powers, resource gathering, upgrading, diplomacy, etc.)  The only problem is, you have to book an entire day (with the right group) to play a game.  But oh what a ride!

Although I can rarely get this on the table, it doesn't stop me from trying, and some of my best gaming experiences has been with this game.

Only one play at 6 players (normally the best configuration)... Never again! Role selection is simply stupid (and we play with a variant, 1 point, still strong), nothing is fluid. The only good move I did in the game was to vote a law to shorten the game 1 hour: cheers!

RATING: 6
I love the concept and style of the game - it's stacked with variable set ups, factions and technologies to explore, plus numerous extra bits to customise each game. Everything points to a big box of fun - which it is, if you have plenty of time and like minded opponents. However, despite the array of components the gameplay isn't especially varied. Yes, you have different styles of play depending on your faction and events can change some rules, but I feel the game has a script where it builds up slowly to a flashpoint where suddenly one player attacks and the others jump on the remains (or the leader)... or not, because as the board doesn't really relate to the collecting of victory points you don't need to confront the other players (except over Mecatol Rex) and the game can become very static. 

Also the victory conditions don't allow the players to specialise and attain victory through conquest, politics or economic domination. Warfare isn't essential, despite the massive (defensive) build up that occur, and economics and politics given very minor roles, which seems a waste in a "game of epic galactic trade, politics and conquest". The game has these elements but they are all a sideshow to the main event which is the collection of technology, resources, influence and maybe a grab at the centre planet. 

Overall, Twilight Imperium 3 has too much chrome, downtime and small frustrating rules and not enough substance to make a great space epic, which is a shame as there is very little on the market that comes close... I'll just have to play it some more until there is.

Colossal. Vast. Legendary. Heroic. Homeric. Epic.

One of the best games ever designed, TI3 is all of the above and more.  No two games will ever play out the same way due to its vast and grand scale. Negotiation, backstabbing, political intrigue, double crossing, kidnapping and murder; with spaceships, wormholes and lasers.

Can't play this game enough due literally to its daunting length and the time commitment that must be made.  I get to play it about twice a year due to the difficulty of scheduling out the six to ten hour game length and finding the friends that are willing to commit to seeing it through.  Wife out of town?  Time to schedule a game.  Two weeks vacation? Lets carve out a day; come over at noon.  

I will be teaching/playing this game with five teenagers (aged 15 to 17) this summer at a camp.  I have scheduled five consecutive days each consisting of two hour sessions. Will it be enough?  I think not since they have not played before.  But they will get a good taste of what this Wagnerian  epic has to offer.  Sam Healy, where are you?

RATING: 6.75
Very good epic empire building game.  Colonizing planets, developing new technology, waging war, producing combat units, conducting trade and engaging in diplomacy.  Rules are fairly detailed, lots of player choices and options.  Plenty of sci-fi colour/theme.  The voting and trade mechanics provide for plenty of diplomacy.  Components are very nice and the game is very pretty to look at.

I have put about 7 hours into this game (two different games, not nearly to completion).  Downtime seems reasonable but the full game is probably quite long (a good 6 hours or more with 4 players?)  The game should have lots of replay value, due to the variable set-up, different races and other cards.  Certainly a lot of luck involved, especially the action cards which can completely surprise you.  Probably some balance issues with the races as well, but couldn't detect anything too serious.

All in all a fun game, though probably too long and too much downtime for some people's tastes.

First time I tried this game and it is veeery complex. Many rules, some confusing, I had to keep asking about clarifications on some rules all the time, BUT all in all a good experience.
I ended up getting mangled almost into oblivion half way through the session and struggled to not get killed entirely until the game ended.
Days afterwards I found myself thinking about strategies I could have executed in different ways, and other ways to utilies the different cards I had and such.
Will definitly try it again, and then probably change my rating. Time will tell. :)

This is more of a "Civilization in space" game than a wargame. Played as a wargame instead of a civilization/evolution game, a couple of hours of gaming time is added to an otherwise long game. 

The game is really about victory points and not about what happens on the gaming board. You have to be able to accept this fact and play for victory points instead of concentrating too much on the board, or you might be disappointed.

The game suffers from long down-time and runaway leader tendencies.

Initial setup can can decide who wins the game before it starts, which is a terrible thing in a game as long as this (4   hours). Too unbalanced for its game length.

If played with the right people this is a great game.  If played with the wrong people it can be strangely unsatisfying.

Edit: This is a game that gets much better as you get more familiar with all the intricate rules.

Edit: This is clearly a game you've got to put a lot of effort into playing, but the more you play it the better it seems to get.  I've got no hesitation in saying it's one of my favourite games of all time now.  Back when it first came out I wrote a review for the game but I should have waited a couple of years - my paltry review doesn't do the game justice.

Edit: dropped a point off my mark.  My last couple of games of this fell really flat.  When this game works it's one of the best gaming experiences ever.  When it doesn't, it's very unsatisfying.

Impressions after one play of the "Shattered Ascention" community mod (includes both expansions, but no optional rules, many many tweaked rules).

Okay, now that's one of those games that I had a dream of the night after the first play. There aren't many games out there that got me so far. Lot's of things I totally love about board games, but I can also see why some people really dislike it. Because It's messy. because it's very much a typical FFG release with too much play time and an awful amount of fiddliness. Causes frustrations in the vein of "Conquer the world" Risk and Diplomacy. Because, like all 4x games with a really long play time, I expect it to be a fun killer for all players who drop out of the race. 

Still, TI3 is a game I'd always want to play NOW.

In all honesty, the way TI3 comes out of the box, I don't know if I wanted to rather just abstain and rate it a 3 or 4. With all the fixes etc., well yeah, more like a 9.

Great game for those days you want it to be complex, massive and full of intrigue.
This game has several rule systems for different parts [politics, exploration, scientific development, war] which all combine under the umbrella of having to chose your main strategy every turn [through the use of specific cards].
The only bad thing about the game, is its length. It can easily run into a 12 hour game [from the moment you open the box till someone wins] if 4 people play it [4 make for the most interesting game, IMHO], though 6 to 8 hours is much more of the norm.

Dropped my rating on this very slightly, mostly because the fun I experience in play doesn't warrant the time required to get to that fun. Looking forward to a 4th edition, and/or simply playing Eclipse instead.

With both expansions in play, this is an extraordinarily fiddly game. I think this rewards a certain kind of player -- the kind who plays nothing but TI and has a deep mastery of it.

Epic ! Indescribable ! Take a Modular Board, Add Variable Race Powers, Variable Turn Orders, Action Selection, Politics, Trading, 4X, Objectives for Victory Points, Ships, Wormholes, Tech Building, Fantastic Artwork and Graphics, and Christian Peterson's magic touch, and you have Twilight Imperium 3.

Probably the best game I've ever played, though I'm certainly not good at it.

Better with some of the expanions, but not all at the same time.

Arrived on 28th of February. Am aching to try this baby out!

So I finally had my first go on this game. We didn't play a full game though. Aware that this is going to take a long time to play we settled on just about as much as it took us to get into the playing mechanics, absorb the rules, etc. Everybody was quite happy with the result and I believe this is going to be a game that I'll be playing more often than I initially expected, which is great. The concept is awesome, playing pieces are good but still, I think I slightly prefer StarCraft over this one, but only time will tell! Need more games of both to decide...

Its super hard to get a game of TI3 going.  Its also super hard to convey the objective in TI3 to other players.  Eventually most players will start to get it and then you'll stop playing because it ate into multiple days over the course of a few weeks.  Its good fun once it gets going though.

There are two major problems with this game:

1: You fight for a few points back and forth in a game that takes hours to play. This means strategy and tactics is less important and luck and position is crucial. 

2: Downtime. I've played a game with more then 90 min between my moves with NO interaction during that time. I was lucky that there was a sports event on TV that I could follow to the end before it was my turn again.

I know I rate this game lower than it's average, but that's just the way it goes.  I love SciFi games and war games.  This just doesn't hook me.

I find TI:3 too fiddly.  It's a cross between Puerto Rico and Throneworld in my mind, and just takes too long for what it is.  In the base game, there's little "need" for combat and holdings on the map rarely translate much into actual victory or defeat.

The idea of the roles in the game is OK, but I find the execution lacking.  It just makes the game really long and more involved for me.

Too fiddly, too little drive to fight, too little gain for eating your opponent's lunch.

I played this PBF on the TI3 wiki before it imploded and I get to play FTF at WBC annually.  TI3 is just a fantastic experience and a great game with meaningful choices.  It has been overloaded with expansions that add a few critical improvements along with a fair amount of dross.  That said, the state of the game after Shards of the Throne is near perfect.

RATING: 8
Space is big. Really big. And so is this game. However, once you take the bits of the sprues, punch out the counters and bag everything up, all the components fit in an A4 file box. TWA3 is an intense and rather long gaming experience. There are obviously some question marks over the Initiative/Imperium strategy card mechanism but the game still works and there are a number of optional fixes. My real problem with this game is the difficulty in finding the time, space and 4-5 opponents required to play it properly.

RATING: 9
1 play - First play was 3rd addition (during which time 4th edition was available for pre-order). Wow was I blown away with this game, which I just expected to be an epic version of other battle games. Its the VP scoring from objectives that truly make this game great, as the focus really becomes on negotiating deals to obtain objectives (NOT total dominance). These means that alliances formed by players are NOT ultimately undermined by the knowledge that one player will need to destroy the others in the end (which is generally true in a lot of war games like it). In fact, many objectives are not even battle related!

There is definitely a learning curve here. The base rules are simple, but when adding all the other components it is quite heavy. However, it is worth the time to learn. This is a well balanced game of politics and battle, where every decision can cost you. At six hours and up, it is not an everyday game, but if you have the time, check it out.

The problem is that the game is just too damn long. We have played with people who are all familiar with the game, but I don't think I have seen a game that was less than 10 hours, and that's just too much for one game on one day. If the game was somehow quicker, then I would be down about anytime.

The most awesome civilization game I have played to date. I could say many things about this game, good bad and inbetween, but the real selling point in my case is theme.

And to me, THAT is a good game.

Era dai tempi di Buck Rogers che non giocavo a un balocco con ambientazione spaziale classica, e ci voleva proprio. Il setting è azzeccatissimo, ed è bello che sia regole (tante) che lunghezza del gioco (per niente breve) contribuiscano a caratterizzare l'ambientazione (dopotutto una space opera è lunga e complessa... un gioco che vi si ispira può essere breve e semplice?). Un po' di considerazioni sparse: 

1) il gioco è una festa per gli occhi: i soldatini, la grafica delle carte, gli splendidi esagononi. solo a vederlo ti fa star bene e ringrazi di essere un geek. 
2) nel gioco non stai mai fermo. Non conosco la vecchia edizione, ma tutti lamentano una certa staticità che adesso è fortunatamente sparita. 
3) mi sono piaciute le carte strategia alla Puerto Rico. 
4) anche se all'inizio è frustrante, la presenza di innumerevoli colli di bottiglia (numero contato di mosse, numero contato di navi costruibili da una stazione, numero contato di navi che possono coesistere nello stesso sistema, ecc.) aiuta a rendere il gioco più equilibrato: a che serve avere mille unità produttive se puoi costruire solo quattro cose per volta? 
5) la parte politica mi ha lasciato piuttosto freddo. leggendo le regole, speravo in qualcosa di più decisivo come in Warrior Knights, dove le vittorie passano dall'Assemblea. 
6) chi in "World of Warcraft - il gioco da tavolo" si faceva le pippe guardando gli oggetti e i poteri, qui se le fa col tech tree. è davvero enorme e sfaccettato ma, mi chiedo, non sarà un po' troppo grande e un po' sopravvalutato per la vittoria finale? 
Concludendo, un gran gioco: non breve, non semplice ma ottimo e da rigiocare all'infinito: peccato che la sua durata sia veramente scoraggiante.

This is a huge game, in all aspects. A lot a components, epic in size. Unfortunately, I never was able to finish any of the 3 games I've played, due to lack of time (played 4 turns). This puppy takes along time to set-up, explain rules and play. I guess it can be a rewarding experience to play to conclusion, just as long as you play with players that know the rule beforehand and don't take forever to play their turns...

A good game, it's unfortunate I won't play it often due to time constraints.

Points given to design, pieces and layout. It IS a beautiful game not to mention a heavy one too. However, even with FFG's bid in streamlining this game, I've found that it can still take up to 6 hrs to finish a game and this is subjective to the players taking their time in planning their moves. More often than not, you would not see someone attacking within the first 3 turns and this equates to about 1½ of game play! In all this game requires a lot of time and players in order to make it fun. Still a good game like T1 and T2

It is longish, and way heavy for most of my Euro playing friends. The theme may turn off some as well (sci-fi). Not me! Worth every penny (and it is expensive, although not by the pound). The huge number of posts about this game tells alot about it's power. Popularity alone does not make a great game, but it often leads you to one!

4/13 traded for Eclipse

Oct 2014: lowered to a 4. Eclipse beats this one in every way for me now. The ISC card is bad, you need to use the expansion. I'm embarassed by my earlier comments about this game. You can tell at the time I was in the middle of my "crazy" period, where I was buying $100 of games a month, and was playing all of them. Now its down to about $300/year or so, a lot more on iOS. And today I am a fan of cleaner, simpler, more elegant designs. And more playable.

It's a sprawling space opera that has not been replicated in any other game. It can be quite long depending on how well versed the players are and the variants being used, but with experience, the play time is ~60 minutes per player. The races feel unique, the techs are fun and the game isn't about military strength most of the time. The political phase is by far my favorite part of the game. Passing laws can leave some very memorable moments. The first expansion, while not 100% necessary, does fix the issue with the Imperium tile. Turn order basically passed every single turn as getting a free point is WAY too good to pass up. It can literally be 10-20% of your score by doing absolutely nothing each turn.

Extras: FFG Sleeves - Mini Yellow and 4 d10's in each player color.

Played a three player game once ...just WOW! Update December 2016 - played our first 6 player game, all new players. Game took 8 hours ending with epic battles for Mecatol Rex and smaller 'other' wars at the edges of the galaxy. All players enjoyed it so much we didn't really want it to end. Only disappointment seemed to be with the political cards which rarely applied to anything relevant but everything else was engrossing at almost every point!

I really wanted to like this game.
And the 2 times we have played it it has been a blast... for 2-3 hours.
You build your fleets and build more and have fun and then when you would like to use them the game is over.
Or you have already played for 4-5 hours and start to get really bored already.
Too slow pace in the game.
You build starport, wait till next turn to build a fleet, wait again till next turn and then you move the fleet.
3 turns to get an attack going!
Anyone has time to react to that!!
Faster pace and better objectives really needed to save this game.

I just read the new rules for the expansion.
Seems that the expansion corrects(!) a lot of the mistakes with the original.
Better strategy cards, more aggresive Objectives, quick start rules to get it going, faster colonization of empty planets (via a strategy card), cheaper technology,  etc.
It's a shame that the expansion costs 50 (!) Euro since it makes the game become more like what the original should have been!
The rating would be much higher also if the playing time was shorter. Now it never gets played because it takes so long time.

We have now played twice with the expansion. Fantastic game! Just a shame about the playing time. We can never finish a full game of this. But it was fun both times anyway!

The stack of Action Cards is 3 inches high for Christ's sake. The Political Cards are 3 inches high. There are a bajillion unique races with all of the expansions, each with their own FLAGSHIP and starting tech....OH, there is a tech tree by the way!! I mean come on, this game is awesome!!!!

This is one of those 'one day I must get around to playing this' games that is good to own but unlikely to be much played - esp. with both the expansions. With playing time of more than three hours per player, and the game (with expansions) running from 3 to 8 players, games are likely to run very very long, so they require a big commitment from all of the players. Game also demands patience because there are a lot of decisions to be made and so there is a serious risk of AP.

I wasn’t sure if I would ever actually play this, or if I would like it if I did. It turns out, I was pleasantly surprised. There are more euro-y resource management elements than I expected, and they dovetailed nicely with the pure Ameritrash of huge fleets of plastic spaceships and handfuls of dice. We played a 3 player game in about 5 hours. The trade and negotiation elements of them game were not prominent, and the experienced player reported that comes from the low player count. I’m not sure I’d ever want to go above 4 players due to the length of the game, but we’re already planning another session soon.

After getting through the complex and endless rules, we really liked this game.  It took some time to get the hang of it though.

I like all of the different aspects of the game and the various tactics and methods available to achieve victory points.

My negative thought was the luck factor in battles.  While you may heavily outgun your opponent, you can still lose solely to bad luck.  That is a shame.

I think that it is highly replayable if you allow a really long time to play.  Very much worth devoting the time to do so though.  Can't wait to try it again.

The more that I play this game, the more that I really like it!

I love Twilight Imperium.  I played my first game about a month ago and this game will remain one of my favorites for quite some time.  I played this with a good amount of people I've never met before and it was still a blast playing.  I would recommend this highly for anyone that doesn't mind a game that will honestly take an entire day for them to play.  Out of all of the long games I've played this is by far my favorite, and the best part about it is that there are so many modules and ways to play that I will probably never get to experience them all (as opposed to other long games).

Epic and with lots of stuff to keep track of, this game is about balancing your options (or unbalancing them as the case may be) so you can get good progress while managing to keep the other players at bay or unaware of that progress. Learning to take advantage of your race and position seems to be key, and though the game has long term strategy goals it shines when you manage to pull a good tactical move on the political or military arenas.

A good game, but a little hampered by its own complexity. I am part of the "Base ISC is broken" school of thought; the problem with it is that it takes over the focus of the game too much. The game becomes an exercise in jockeying for it from the get-go, to the exclusion of all the other interesting things it has to offer. The game can also be a monster; with 6 players, you're looking at a big time investment.

Me and my group battled this one out two times in one month.  It is a lot of fun but both times the game ended just when it was getting good.  Plus the Imperial card is completely nonsensical; It seems like they could integrate the mechanics better than that.  Both times the winner was not necessarily the strongest in anything but rather the one who got the imperial card the most times. It makes for a silly ending that seems divorced from the gameplay. If one was ambitious it could probably be modified to be a great game, but at 5-6 hours a game you would really have to love this game.

Finding time to play board games with my friends can sometimes be difficult.
Most of the time I find we can only manage 2 - 3 hours so play various lighter games BUT on those rare occasions when I can get this to the table,there is NOTHING that can compare.This game has it all.
 If you've stumbled across this page and have ever contemplated buying this game then please take one thing away THIS GAME IS AWESOME! even if you only get it to the table twice a yearthe experience will be worth it.

Years later, I've played this game a few dozen times and I still enjoy every minute of it.  One of my all time favorites.  A long game with lots of to explore, and every play is different.

It took the first expansion to really make the game work, but with the expansions there is tons and tons of content.  If you're willing to commit to the playtime, there's no better empire building game out there.

One of the best day-long space battle games - this one takes a pretty dedicated time sink.

There are too many issues with this game.  Way, way too long for a light Axis & Allies or Risk 2210 type of game.  It has serious balance issues. You can practically lose the game during the initial setup, even before the play has begun! Very fiddly and messy with a huge number of components. In fact, so many components that make it difficult to play the game on any normal or even large size table.  Gets frustratingly slow and boring as hell due to long down time and time spent on logistics that have no impact on the game results.
Perhaps enjoyable to hardcore space/si-fi fans, but as for me, I would rather play Axis & Allies or Risk 2210 than TI.

Just epic. Any game that can run 6-10 hours with you only realising near the end of the game just how long you've spent playing it clearly has a lot going on to keep the attention span. Manages to pack the grandiose sense of galactic exploration, struggles for domination and political intrigue into a (relatively, considering the potentials for strategy) surprisingly straightforward to play package. This game is widely revered for good reason.

RATING: 9
Update: after collecting dust on the shelf for several years, this game finally got to the table for a real play. And it's everything it should be, and more. This game is an event game, to be sure, only pulled out once in a blue moon. However, if you're into epic gameplay, and have the right group (an ABSOLUTE NECESSITY!), you will treasure this title.

Older: Love what I've experienced of this game. My game group is not very receptive to complex, long games. This game is both of those...very complex, and very long. One needs to have a group of like-minded players in order to get this to the table.

However, even based on the sporadic experiences I've had with this game, with relatively unwilling players, it was still always a great game session (at least for me). I suppose what I'm trying to say is that this game is aimed at a very specific type of player. If you are that type, and are willing to hunt around for others, than this game will reward you for your efforts.

I enjoy the technology growth. One major flaw would be that some Secret Objective cards are not balanced with others. Another would be the Imperial Strategy Card is too powerful and is almost a must-take whenever possible.

[b]Comment:[/b] Epic area control game where you compete with other players for both public and secret goals for points. Takes 8-11 hours to play with max players, even when everyone knows all the rules. 

Despite it being a highly strategic game, it uses dice for combat. The game also pretty much requires expansions to be playable thanks to the final job card being too powerful in the base.

No game so far has come along and replaced this as our epic space game, but that's not to say this behemoth couldn't still use some streamlining. In particular, the technology deck is difficult to understand, as the way some techs need other techs first means you really need to know the deck well and decide what you will work to before the game begins.

ITS A CLASSIC NIGGA
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
It is a good game, and sometimes I consider buying it when a good opportunity arrives, but there are some things that annoy me to no end in this game.

The implementation of the theme in this version (third edition) is somewhat faulty. So, the council has decided... so what? What if I'm a rogue nation? What if I don't like all that dialogue and feel I can just keep fighting to conquer all until there is but one people standing? That's the thing you SHOULD be doing in this game, only you're not. The game seems to stay forever on the edge of action - and in the end very little of significance really happens.

It doesn't have enough conflict to please the grognard in me, it's not strategic enough to please my inner eurogamer and it has too many flaws in the narrative it creates to make me completely immerse in its theme.

Let's take this out of the way: Politics in this game is just a card game where one player tries to block the other in ways that far too often make no thematic sense whatsoever. It's politics as if every country in our World just blindly obeyed the United Nations on matters like technology research... Many things that may make you win the game make very little sense on a second analysis.

I feel that to fully enjoy this game you must make an effort to convince yourself that the logic behind the way the game works is not gamey but thematic instead (this would be ok if the game played in, like, 3-4 hours... it doesn't).

It's not everyday that I'm in the mood to do that for such a long period of time.

I have an OCD desire to see if the 'poorly rated' wargames are really that bad, so....

1 4-p game (wuth SE expansion)that went almost 9 hours with at least a couple of more to go. I was the only person not to have played before but there were so many rule uncertainties and errors, and combined with having never seen the Action or Political Card decks (nor the Objective decks) the play was glacial and pure chaos. It felt like the leaders would be beaten back in succession so the VPs would be gained at about equal rates until someone made a shot for the big Secret Objective points for the win (somewhat like Catan). So it felt as pointless as Risk until the endgame was reached but it took far far too long to get there. I will avoid playing this game again at almost all costs.

Note: With more experience the game would flow better but still would not go above a 5 in my book.

RATING: 7
Couples awesomely posh bits with euro hybrid rules that take it beyond the traditional ugo-igo build & conquer play of the previous editions.  The command chit system is especially innovative. The victory conditions, as driven by the Imperial action can lead to a scripted feeling, but does provide a much needed guaranteed end game.  Slightly flawed, but very fun.

As I have self-identified in the past mostly as a eurogamer, it feels somewhat strange to list Fantasy Flight game as my favorite at the moment, but TI seems to be a bit of a cross over. Some of my friends that tend to like Ameritrash, really got into the theme and enjoyed the game, helping to bridge the gap in interests. The only downfall with this game is the time investment required. I absolutely have loved every session with this game, but the fact that each play takes so much planning means this game doesn't see the table very often.

RATING: 8
An epic - meaning LONG - empire building game. Definitely for the Sci-Fi fan in you. 
This is a hard game to rate. 
Certainly a beautiful game with outstanding components. Does a good job of capturing the feel of its theme. 
An outstanding game? No too many game issues including - the length, random factors, problems with balance reigning the leaders, catching up when you are behind hamper it. 
A poor game? No there is a lot of options for your turn and the game has a lot of likable mechanics for example the strategy card and the command counter mechanics to limit your actions. 
Feel the variants with Age of Empire (revealed objects) help focus people on what is necessary for the game. With out it you must have a list of the public objectives so you can be aware of what is coming. At the very least a new player needs a list of all the possible public objectives. 
Not as convinced about the alternative SC8. While the base version limits some selection of roles it acts a nice timer. However, all players have to remember to work against the players who gets the sc8 twice. It does throw an advantage to players 1 and 2.

I tried the first edition back when it came out and it struck me as a wannabe game by a wannabe publishers.

Right now, this game is long and overproduced considering the small amount of decisions you get to make.

A fiddly slog with little satisfaction to be found through victory or play. Why people still wish to spend time on this game is beyond me.

Great game. A little bit lenghty, but really fun. It's not a family game, and has lots of decision making instances, and requires strategic and tactical gaming abilities. It's not a wargame (althouhg it can be) and a goal oriented player will beat a brawler everytime.

Combats seem more balanced than Eclipse due to d10 rather than d6 - but eclipse upgraded ships are more fun to create.
Need to juggle everything (and everyone).  No full alliance mechanic - If you are in a sector with someone else's ships - you shoot.  Needs playing through more than once to make the best of the galaxy creation bit.  Not sure on balance of races after one play through. So far only used basic rules

Good grief.  Great eye candy.  Great idea.  Someone put their heart and soul into this game, and came up with a complicated wall-o-exceptions.  This huuuuuuge game takes a day to get going.

I was a bit underwhelmed by this. This game is not bad by any account but I cannot see more than the sum of its parts. Neat and complicated mechanics but stale and rather static gameplay. I was never really excited while playing this but felt like carefully executing a fine plan without the spirit of adventure and chaos you would expect from a game of interstellar conflict and colonization. I can see why people like this but I need more chaos, randomness and surprise in my games.

RATING: 8
I've been wanting to play this game for 15 years. I finally had my first chance on 06/03/16. I initially scored this a 9, but downgraded it to an 8 after my second play (see below). The first time was a fantastic experience, but two issues stood out for me as problematic:

1) It's not really a 4X game. It's a point collection game. I learned this the hard way towards the end of the game. You often need to do things that are counter-intuitive for a 4X type experience to get the points. I will be better prepared for future plays, but it does take something away from the storytelling and epic nature of what a true 4X should be. Attacking a player to get a point, the other player being ok with that, and avoiding a more protracted war, is more of a Euro-style mechanic, which irks me a bit, and was not what I would have expected from this game.

2) I was given an preliminary objective card at the start of the game that was fairly opposed to my racial bonuses and goals. I had to go off and focus on something that didn't make a lot of sense so I could turn in the preliminary objective card to get my secret objective card. This wasted a lot of time. In future games, I will ask for a house rule where you can get two preliminary objective cards (and secret objective cards) and pick one of them. This seems less punitive.

My first game was 7-8 hours of play with five players. I love this game and want to play it again soon. Here's the thing, though – if I had 7-8 hours to play a five-person space 4X game, and the 4x experience was what I was craving, I would prefer to play Stellaris by Paradox Interactive, a true 4X space computer game, with four of my friends around a table with laptops. And, I'm much more of a board gamer than I am a video gamer. Twilight Imperium III is not a shining example of 4x, but it's a shining example of board games.

I played my second game on 10/16/16. It ended up as a 10-hour long game for four players. If I am going to dedicate 10 hours to game, it needs to have the epic game payoff and I don't think that's possible for me with just four players. There's not enough dynamic activity with just four. Add to that, when you are playing this game with four players, you use all eight strategy cards, which means a four player game is actually longer than a five and perhaps six player game. This second experience downgraded the game from a 9 to an 8 for me. I don't think I will want to play this game again with just four players. Either give me a big, epic, multi-dimensional game with lots of activity or give me a shorter game with less players.

The richness of this game is impressive; the history and lore developed for the empire and distinct races definitely contribute to the game's sense of grandeur as does the artwork and its sheer size.  Its scalability 3 - 6 players (8 with the expansion), ever changing board, changing objectives and the fact that there are a pool of 10 races (14 again with the expansion) one might face contribute to its replay-ability.

Instead, you could play Eclipse and Puerto Rico - twice each - and have more fun. Likely not to be played again.

Epic is one word for it.  Convoluted, inelegant, and overwrought are others.  The length of this game comes not from grand operatic player interaction, but rather from excessive downtime and tons of fiddly rules.
Still, it is fun.   I've got other ideas of how I'd like to spend 8 hours though.

RATING: 4
Terrible game. Needs heavy work to make playable or interesting. Length is too great for how little goes on. First player has too strong of an advantage. Choices for roles are too obvious due to broken roles. Combat is too deadly for both sides to engage in without leaving both players lagging behind. Game encourages opportunism instead of strategy or risks. 

Not worth the time to play.

May be better with the expansion, but even that is doubtful.

First impression after just 2 plays: 
Even though I really like the theme and the material, I am somewhat disappointed. Gameplay seems to be very slow, it takes quite some time to accomplish something. Before you can really build up a fleet or your tech tree, the games ends and that still took at least 5 hours.

My favorite game. At first I was reluctant to get this since it is hard to find a group committed to play it through the end, but even in our unfinished games we had TONS of fun (and the time just flew).

I recommend this to any heavy gamer with a mature group. The mechanics are very clean and streamlined. The amount of decision making and politics involved on this game is enormous, but the mechanics works so well that you never fell overwhelmed.

Also, there is very little downtime. The actions takes little time to complete, and you usually want to pay attention to the actions of your opponents while planning your next action.

The base game comes with some balance issues that does become obvious after some plays. The first expansion fixes that entirely.

RATING: 8
Very fun in depth game.  Good for hardcore players only, very rule heavy.  Playtime is insanely long.  Would rate higher but playtime is just too long.

Had a group that used to meet in Madison to play this game all day long once a month for about 6 months.  We had some really good times playing it.  Due to the game's political nature, you can really enjoy jumping into your role with either friends or people you don't know.  By the end, you'll all be at each other's throats either way (hopefully the people you play with won't remain this way after the game ha).

Definitely recommend randomized seating for any group where you don't know the individuals involved.  The political nature of the game can grant advantages to those willing to team up for part of the game, and friends tend to do this irrationally.

Long, tedious, and fairly random.  The best strategy is figuring out how to end the game quickly.  If someone figures that out, please let me know.  If the game moved quicker and was more about playing than wading through a mess of rules and mass confusion, it might have been a better experience.  Even then, it's probably not my style of game, but I'll try it (or the base game) again.

There are a lot of great things about TI. Combat is simple, yet involving. The tech tree is well thought out (even though it requires a bit of work to navigate/organize it), and the game strongly encourages a proper amount of teamwork and betrayal.

All of that being said, sometimes I feel the winning conditions of the game don't line up with the awesome mechanics. Combat seems unnecessary until you need more influence due to the random (often imbalanced) victory point conditions. The game practically rewards turtling.

Variants exist to make these issues more manageable. Just make sure you have them figured out before sitting down for your 6 to 10 hour long game.

Complex, engaging, politically challenging... for the first hour or two, then let the chaos begin! Like many 'big' Fantasy Flight games, Twilight Imperium starts off well and becomes a horrible cluster of a game: followed with debates and a lot of vague decision making. While the game is solidly designed in many ways, Twilight Imperium is just so damn long for very little payoff. Due to these complaints, the game gets played barely once a year, when it does I am exhausted by the end.

>>>Note how ratings drop as I got to know the game better.
First play: Rated a 9.
3rd play: Rated a 7.5.
5th play: Rated a 6.0.
~9th play: Rated a 4.0

Fighters are overpowered (and destroyers are underpowered) and why in the world have they put in all these event cards to make big ships even more useless?  

Random victory conditions mean that you are likely to be hosed for entire duration of the game.  (e.g. a peaceful race with no combat bonuses gets military victory conditions.)

Voting on laws sounds like a cool idea, but rarely does it matter.  B5 game has votes that are more important which works better.

Played a couple more games, and both times a player was totally out of the game from inappropriate victory conditions.  This is very bad for a game this long.

Many people have mentioned how early players have a huge advantage over those in later positions.  This is a race game to 10 VP.  But rules are set up so players get 20% of their VP each time they start the round.  So player in 1st position has gained 4/10 of victory (with free victory points) when he starts 2nd round.  If 1st player doesn't win on his turn, second player is at 4/10 of victory on next turn.  Rarely in a 4 or 5 player game, does 3rd player get a chance to get to 4/10 of victory (with these free points) as the game is usually won by then.  I've never seen a player in 4th or 5th position win this game.  Why would they want to play a 5 - 6 hour game when they are walking dead the whole game?

Have stopped using game rules, when we play we use Owll's rules.  Feels to me like this game was never blind tested by FFG.  For $100 I expect a game to be tested and obvious problems fixed.  Don't feel I should have to buy an expansion to fix gaping problems in base game.  (Their "Game of Thrones 1st edition" boardgame was the same way.)  Last Fantasy Flight Game I will buy.

Game rewards turtling far more often than aggressive play.  None of my friends want to play anymore.  I'm going to sell my copy.

Played "Eclipse".  Now I am sure I'm going to sell my copy.

I played half a game of this back in 2008, and within 6 months I bought my own copy. Such is the nature of the beast that it took me until May 2012 to actually play my copy - and when I did it got played two weekends in a row.

The bad points? Play time is crippling - unless everyone knows what they're doing you're looking at upwards of 1.5 hours per player. It's ridiculously unbalanced at times - not so much from the dice but the overpowering nature of some of the cards. 

But for all that - it feels right. It feels big, and epic, and how taking over the galaxy should feel.

Definately don't plan to play this without alotting an afternoon or evening.  First play takes a long time to get going.  Once the players are in the zone, things become a blast!  A 10 if not for how long the game takes.  After five plays, this game takes way too long for my taste expect 4-6 hours for a 6 player game.  With each successive play, my rating gets lower and lower.  There are just too many rules to keep track of.  You need a computer to catch them all.  New expansion brings the game to an absolute crawl.

I love this game.  It isn't perfect, but I love the theme.  Probably more than anything else for me, is the theme.  I love building an empire, I love researching technologies, I love big space ships, I love space battles, I love conquering planets.

It has numerous downsides (time needed to play, no self-balancing mechanics where the current loser gets helped and the current winner gets hindered), but at the same time, I think it helps with the theme of "You're building an empire...in space!", rather than playing a game about building an empire in space.

I play this anytime I can get at least 2 other hardcore gamers together for 6 hours or more.

Beautiful modular board and bits, but extremely long and multiple players are required, as is quite a large table. The box is ridiculously oversized, and should have had containers for all the bits instead of being just one big empty box. Fortunately it is big enough to hold both my separately bought containers and most of the expansion.
Finally played a 2-player version with a number of Shattered Empire options, and it's quite fun.

Lots of bits and choices to play with during the slow build up. Enjoyed the asymmetry, though I think it would benefit from being taken even further. 

Seemed to bog down with nobody wanting to make the first move for Mecatol and weaken themselves.

I'm eager to play again and see if we can get a better grip on the scoring system and give the game more momentum. However, the rest of group is tepid about playing again.

March 2017: Played at Jim's with Jim, Allen, Andrew, Bryan, and Jim's friend Dave. 6-player game took from around 10:30am to 11:30pm. That included 60-90min lunch. No dinner. So, close to 12 hours. Wow. I loved the conversation/company. Lots of laughs. Good attitudes. But the game is waaaaaay to long for what it does in my opinion. Between 10:30am and 5:30pm we only had 4 die rolls. Lots and lots of building up forces, but a looooong time until battles.  Other than the laughs, I liked the asymmetric races, the starting techs, and, of course, Jim's blinged-out copy, I'm glad I can say I've played it. So that's cool. But I'm also glad I can say I will not play it again.

An unwieldy, topheavy behemoth but a lot of fun.  It has a definite epic feel like classics such as Axis & Allies and History of the World.  I especially like the political and diplomatic aspects of the game.  Long, but ultimately very rewarding.  I wish the building and movement of ships were a bit less tedious.  This rating is with the expansion.  Without it would be more like a 7.

Terrific, well-balanced space war game.  This is one of the best games I've played.

The twelve-hour timeframe can get to be too much, though.  Eclipse has made me rethink my love of TI3.

Update, 11/4/14: I've been thinking about Eclipse, which can be a lot of fun, but I always love the long game that this one allows for.  A copy was on clearance at my FLGS, so I bought it.  I had to.  I've wanted it for ten years.

Update, 6/4/17: I've gotten more of a chance to get this to the table recently.  My two older boys (7 & 9) are old enough to be able to play this one now, so we've set games up on the table and played 'em over the course of a week.  This is a really interesting 3 player game, and it's just at the right complexity level for them right now.  We're having great fun.

I've only given it two goes but I have to admit to being disappointed (games that involve this amount of time that do not reward you in two playings have a flaw). Many aspects of the game are cobbled togethor from other sources in a way that doesn't quite work, bits from Eurogames being shoved in (such as the inbuilt timer which attracts so much criticism) without real consideration for how it will affect everything. There is a good game underneath it all and it could probably be brought out if the chrome were radically stripped back (remove trade completely and lose most of the politics, then push it back to a series of military objectives). There is a lot in here but the reality is that the game does everything it is trying to do worse than a game like Buck Rogers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is certainly an experience.  After 1 complete play, there is plenty to keep track of in this game.  Additional player aides for ships etc is a must I think.  Really enjoyed the experience, however, the objective cards with which to score VP's are completely random.  Some of these being completely impossible to achieve, others relatively easy.  It would make more sense these being race specific in the first place rather than pot luck.
I would like to see more trade & diplomacy next time to see if this raises the gamed beyond what essentially turned into a combat centric game.
It promises a lot, with different strategy cards, but whether due to our groups style of gaming, it certainly seemed some of them were less viable to win with.
Coming more from a Euro background, the element of luck vs strategy is greater than I would have anticipated for such a lengthy game.

last played 29.11.14. 3 player game. preliminary objectives vary greatly and meant player secret objectives were hard to get.

Why this is in my collection
Its a space epic, its occasion, played for the experience.  From the games we've played, I would suggest its more prone to luck than strategy.  Happy that we play this, even if its just once a year.

--------------------- TI3 -----------------------

Such a huge game deserves a huge entry in my collection.

With two sets of expansions we can play with up to 10 players. (but alas the flagships and some tech from Shards of the Throne would be missing from that).
3-8(-10) players

=================
Timing
=================

It takes around 3 hours to learn (teach) the rules, at least an hour for the setup (much longer if you haven't yet optimized your storage solution).

Presuming this is done before playing, it takes 6 hours to play by default, eight for "the long war", plus one hour per person above four, plus around another couple of hours if you use the promissory notes from the expansion, for a total of 14 hours if you have all the rules and 8 experienced players.

It needs a total play area around 3m x 2m, plus extra satellite areas for pieces.

RATING: 2
:) Nice components

:) Some interesting mechanics: activating space tiles, colonizing planets, voting system, primary and secondary actions on action cards, ...

:soblue: Despite some cool mechanics, the game horribly fails by the introduction of random overpowered action cards which rain down on players from all sides and which fully randomize a game which holds the false promise of being a tactical/strategic game.

:soblue: The game outstays its welcome: it's way too long for a game with such high randomness/luck factor and downtime is massive. When a big battle occurs two players will be rolling dice for over 5 minutes.

:soblue: The game is filled with small cards and tiny text. The complete lack of iconography makes it impossible to keep track of your opponents abilities and technologies

:soblue: the end game and victory conditions are mostly random too, I guess that suits a casino-style game?

Twilight Imperium is one of the worst game experiences I have had in my gaming carreer. It is an overly long and complex, chaotic and random luck-based game desguised as a tactical strategy game and so one of the biggest hoaxes in the boardgame universe. I never want to play it again.

Moderately complex rules would be fine, but the game then the game goes on to add, tweak, modify and just downright break that core set of rules with all the races, diplomacy and other elements in the game.

One of those games I was really excited about on paper but that never seemed to deliver the gaming experience I was hoping.  

I only played the 3rd Edition base set, but the game seemed to have a lot of problems (namely with the Imperial card and the "I go first, so I'll win in X turns" problem), which I think was addressed in a later expansion.  Perhaps it's a much better game now.

Either way, if you've got a group that likes really deep games, space empires, and doesn't mind learning a relatively complex set of rules, I'd imagine you'd really enjoy this one.  Wonderful components and look.

A long game with many moving parts, though it is not as complex as an uninitiated onlooker might assume. 

I like the idea of having a different set of objectives each game, but the objectives in the one game I played all seemed too similar to one another. They either involved destroying certain types of units, controlling a certain number or type of planets, or winning battles. A fourth edition might streamline this system by removing the randomized objectives and establishing permanent objectives that are slightly more generalized.

I don't think this game is as monstrous as everyone else says... but it's definitely a big game. The basic rules are very simple and easy to learn, and while there's a fair amount of exceptions based on the ships, that's not too bad. It would have been nice to get a ship reference card with the original box.

Lots of stuff to do and think about, and lots of negotiation. The expansion forces more warfare, which is always a good thing.

I think the base set is fine -- I had fun with that and didn't think it was too constrained, but the expansion does make it feel a little more wide open. The game will take longer, though, so be careful. I feel like the game moves very smoothly, but if people get locked up in thought, then it will drag.

A grand strategy, 4x type game - it's not really to my taste - for someone who likes 4x and very strategic games, this would be a 7-9 rating at least.
It takes a very long time to play! So if you are going to, might be a good idea to set aside an afternoon for it!

Played twice.  I like it.  I dunno if the meaningful-decisions-per-hour ratio is very high, but it's a bunch of fun.  I'm currently working on a super-deluxe (and private, since the text of the cards is non-distributable), beautiful PBEM version of this.  ("Currently" here used to mean "Was when I typed this, but have long since abandoned it.")  Ending up selling this -- only got two plays in four (?) years.  I don't have the group for this right now.

I think playing Eclipse first kind of ruined the experience for me.  This game seems to have a lot of elements that really don't need to be in place to make a good 4X game.  The objective cards are interesting, but they seem to throw balance out of the window.  We played for 6 hours with 3 people and stopped at 5 VP's (at 2AM) instead of the normal 10 VP's.  

Plays WAY too long.

RATING: 9
The game is a great illustration of power dynamics. Its a long game but a player narrative grows over that time which makes it enjoyable even when you have no chance to win. 

I give it a 9 because the game can be won while effectively playing in a bubble with no or little player interaction which in my opinion removes the best part of the game. There should be some civ building victory points, but not so many that you can ignore everything else happening at the table.

29-05-2014. Rating after about 6 games of TI:3, using various modules from the expansions.

Great, great, space 4X game. Yes, you conquer, explore, exploit and exterminate. The game is LONG, easily goes up to 8 hours + with 6 players. I've been in some 12 hour games. The 12 hours are no problem for me as the game is so complex and you're able to do so much different stuff that it remains challenging and interesting till the end.

Love it. It's everything I could ever ask for in a game and it's executed perfectly. The length it takes to finish is never a problem for me, but not quite the same for others. Just need to find people that don't mind sitting down at noon on a Saturday with a case of beer and playing this well into the night.

After another play I've come to the conclusion that if this game wasn't so long it would hit the table more. It's perfect, except for the time it takes to play. Only thing keeping it from being a 10.

--May2006-- After a couple partial plays: quite amusing; I wish a game like this had existed thirty years ago; my brothers and I would have played it a lot.
--Jan2007-- Spent 7 hours playing this afternoon; we didn't quite get the aesthetic: score was 1-1-1-0-0-0 when we let it go!  Maybe that 2 point Imperial card isn't so bad an idea.
--Apr2008-- Hah!  Finally got the hang of it.  Our last game worked really nicely.  "When played correctly" it's much better than I'd thought:  at least a 7.

Basic game is, well, fairly basic as far as game sub-systems are concerned.  The ground covers many familiar themes.  That being said, it works fairly well for the ameri-trash type of game it is.  I'm looking forward to another play or two where we use some of the optional rules and expansion elements.

Update: I sold this off.  Frankly, 7 hours of being out of a game because of early randomness is ridiculous.

I would really like to like this game (give it a 9 instead of an 8). It's huge and it has nice pieces. The gameplay is ok, I guess but this mish-mash of different mechanics make it quite unwieldy. Also in all games I have played the winner was the one who didn't get into any bigger battles and in games like these (huge fleets and armadas) it should be required that you do battle!

RATING: 9.5
Very ambitious. A bit overwhelming, and probably not appropriate for newbies.  Game rules are thorough, but their structuring is quirky.  Need some clarification as to acquisition of VP's, overview of turn mechanic, function of PDS systems, limitations and requirements of activating systems, and use of control markers, etc. (most of these are implied and clear enough to veterans; to us, these points were somewhat elusive).  For such an epic game, however, these are minor gripes.  TONS of bits, quailty board tiles, and a quality production overall.  Plastic bits are a bit ornery coming out of the sprues (which were warped), and the "storage tray" is laughable.  Otherwise a very good job (and excellent artwork) top to bottom.  One major gripe (and hardly a unique one with FFG) is that of the inner box--for such a tremendously unabashed box size, with soooooo many pieces, sheesh...where am I to put them all?  The box is actually too big for the game when punched, either due to planned expansions or cost cutting on production (it's cheaper to ship a game unpunched, no doubt).  Kinda reminds me of Dark Tower--once you remove the cardboard that stabilizes the pieces for shipping, and take the pieces off their sprues, I guess you're expected to either dump all 12,0000 bits into the box and spend time sorting it out before every game, or to go out and spend *more* money on some type of storage solution.  That's a bit unforgiveable at this somewhat questionable price range.  This thing doesn't even fit in a suitcase for Pete's sake!!  And the cards--of which there are many--there's not way you can just toss them in the poor excuse for a card holder and assume they'll stay there.  Plan on spending some dough on addressing these issues *after* buying the game.  For all our fits and starts, though, I think with some rules fine-tuning and experience, it will grow to be one of my favorites.  Criticism based upon "it takes too many people" or "it's too long" are baseless with me--you don't go to a movie house if you don't like to sit in the dark.  Don't play galactic conquest games if you only have enough players for chess, enough  time for Uno, and only enough ambition for checkers.  Or buy a PC and play a sim.  If you want something watered down and short--this ain't it and is not trying to be.  I also was confused by knocks because luck may effect whether or not you get "cool" planets near your home system at the beginning of the game and that it could have a bearing on your game expereicce.  These aspects do not overhwelm or destroy the game AT ALL.  Well...yah.  You might get a junk hand dealt to you (just figurativley speaking, I don't mean in the gameplay itself).  That's how it works--but great care was taken to inject balance and options into the game.  You can think you're three moves from losing and end up winning in 2.  Or vice versa.  The phrase "Play it as it lies" comes to mind--and you don't win this game based upon the cool planets near your system (though for some strategies, that could help).  All in all, balanced, colorful, efficient, engrossing, involving, detailed and articulated.  Quite an adept and polished achievement, and one of the best games I've played--could have been a 10 if not for the storage compartment issue.  (There must be expansions coming becuase I think think that there is a TON of air inside the box when it's all packed in well).

I wanted so badly to enjoy this game. Lots of bits, a space theme, a randomized board... In the end, however, I was left disappointed. It's not that I mind long games per se, but the longer a game, the more important it is that the game keep me engaged. This one failed miserably. I realize that this is a great game to many people, but I must give it a 2.5. 

I would actually appreciate it if someone would convince me to try it again, but it would be a tough sell.

I can't help but feel that this game is somewhat clumsy. For one thing, too many of its mechanisms are augmented/eliminated/added by the cards that spill out of every orifice of TI3. Action cards, tech cards, race-specific cards, political cards, and all of them entirely text-based! This game becomes an exercise in double-checking, which just drags the experience to a halt at times.

Despite that, this game can be loads of fun. Its epic scale coupled with a great theme and largely solid mechanisms make for an engaging (if LOOONNNNG) game. I especially enjoy the political maneuvering encouraged by almost every aspect of the game. The constant threatening and pleading really cement players in the experience.

Learned this in June 2009 and played it a few times.. haven't felt like I'm really playing it yet, but instead just going through the turn mechanics to get to the end of the game without really striving for victory points. That has made it less than enjoyable for me and wishing it was just a little simplier.

Seems to have slim and balanced rules, with huge gaming potential. Research, warfare, colonization, politics and all in one game - not the least an epic space atmosphere.

Very close to a 9, for me, even though I find that I don't _always_ want to play (mainly due to time restrictions). There are so many ways to win, so much to do, and politicking seems more or less like a necessity (which is a good thing, love making deals and fighting propaganda wars). There's a lot of downtime with 6+ players if you don't plan ahead, so please do that and you'll shrink playing time from at least 12 hrs (with the expansion) to perhaps 10 or so.

I have played TI3 many times since it came out. I believe that this [i]can[/i] be a pretty solid game, if you use some variants. I have been using the Age Of Empires variant, along with the ISC being only 1 VP. Those are the only variants I use, and neither of them really change the way the game works, just the way the planning and strategy is used. Being able to see all the goals, and activley pursue them, is what makes the Age Of Empires such a good addition to the gameplay. The Command Counters are a good aspect, limiting what your able to do, and having to make some long term plans.  All actions are neatly tied into the planet that was activated with the Command Counter, so there is no confusing what everybody else is doing, and where. Simple Combat, powerful Action cards, Political cards that get voted on, and different abilites each round via the Strategy cards, all making this an interesting experience that will be different each time.

Stop comparing Eclipse to TI3. Totally different experiences. This is a game that tells a story and that you talk about what happened in the game days after you played it.

Nice update to the original game. Steals mechanics from Puerto Rico (!) and has bigger hexes and plastic units. Tech cards are a bit annoying; the first edition tracks worked better, but I guess the tree is a little different now.

Only 1 play.The scale and depth were amazing.My main complaint is that we had about 6 non obvious rules questions, 3 of which still have not been answer after checking FAQ and forums.The combination of the Strategy cards, tech, politics and action cards make for lots of rules questions as you wade through how they all interact.After 1 play of Shattered Empire I downgrade the basic game because I would not play it again without that expansion.

SHORT SUMMARY: A regular group has been coming to my house to play games. Every single time TI3 has been the requested game for the main event. This game has its flaws (lots of them), but its fun to play and so far ahead of the competition in its category that no other game is considered. Thats less a comment on TI3's particular traits, and more a comment on the general quality of boardgames of this type. We just don't really have a viable alternative.

I haven't made my mind up on this game yet. On one hand I always want to play it (hence the 9 rating), but thats because its my newest and shiniest game. On the other hand, I have some doubts about the game. If these doubts become substantiated the score is going to plummet like my War of the Ring rating. I won't go into my doubts here until I've played more games, but anyone who has played Rommel in the Desert must be able to make comparisons with this game about movement rules.

After a few more plays this game actually flows a lot better than I thought it would, and the main game scales really well from 4 upwards. Not sure about with just 3 yet. Still waiting for someone to distill it all down to 2 hours.

I played one 6-player game and didn't have much fun as the L1Z1K. Then I played a 4-player game as the Yssaril Tribes the week after and had a blast. I don't know if it was because of the group, because I was having more fun roleplaying the Yssaril or what.
What I do know is that Twilight Imperium is a collection of pretty crap mechanics that don't add up to much, but that the interplay between the players at the table creates the fun. I think it all comes down to the players as to whether the fun of that interplay outweighs the bad aspects of the game, which are primarily its mediocre mechanics, its lack of any real weighty strategic or tactical content, over long playing time, and general fiddlyness of rules and playing pieces (clearing up after 6 players by yourself can take a LONG time).
I've just picked up the expansion and I'm actually getting emails from my gaming group saying how excited they are to be playing a game of TI3 with all the extra stuff. I've never seen that reaction before. My group at least is getting a lot of fun out of this game.
If you're considering getting this game though, be honest with yourself about whether you will actually be able to regularly get the players together to play it. If not, stick to something that requires less players.

You absolutely must play this game using Age of Empires. Without it the game totally drags.

Think I'm getting my science fiction fix playing Battlestar Galactica now though. Its got the epic space feel and wonderful theme of TI3, but is so much more fun to play.

[i]Twilight Imperium[/i] has everything that you ever dreamed in an epic space empire building game: Tech tree, different races, development, exploration, expansion, production, trading, secret and public objectives, warfare, diplomacy, politics... There are also tons of plastic miniatures, cards, reference sheets, counters and dice rolls, and a huge modular board made of big hexagons. Nevertheless, even when it has it all to be the greatest space gaming experience, it loses in the cost-benefit ratio, cause it takes so long to play that the game can become weary after a while. Even beauty itself can tire people out. Still it worths the effort to pull this monster out from time to time.

It's a celebration of the ridiculous! 
After first play, it feels rough and unfinished. We encountered a lot of problems and the rules aren't as clear as they could have been, especially seeing the complexity of the game. 
Expansion Shattered Empire seems to patch these holes in the gameplay, so I might take a look into that. 
The game seems to have much potential, but feels not entirely worked out yet. The theme is great by the way, so if SE really patches these problems up I'll edit my score and it might become one of my favorites.

Edit: SE patches it up well in my opinion.

This game has many things I hate about "Ameritrash" games: There's some serious imbalance in the Secret Objectives and Action Cards, and I wonder if Advanced Fighters may be broken powerful, and it's just a long dang game--even with people who don't take a long time on turns. 

But I still had a great time paying this. 

[Update: Played with the expansion and it was even more fun. Now at a 9.]

My only criticism of the game is its prohibitive play time. The mechanics are genius, abusive turtling is ruled out and players are encouraged to bribe, threaten and coerce one another in the excellently thought-out political section of the game. A must-have for any board game fan. That being said, the game is far too long to play during anything but a dedicated all-day session, and finding other willing participants for that isn't going to be easy!

I enjoy the mechanics, and I've had fun everytime I played.  My gripes are the play length (take "too long" and keep going), and that there are too many rules to interpret.  Especially with the expansion, there's tons of new action cards that don't specify what to do in a tie, or some other ambiguity, and there is as much debate about the rules as there is playing.

Having played a few games games now, I think this is a game that needs players to pay constant attention to what the others are doing.

I will not rate this game. I have never been a fan of empire building games. x I was taught by the FFG demo master so I didn't have to wade through the rules but I felt the game action was too slow in developing for my taste. The whole explore/conquer and build up for war is boring and tedious for me. I like the shooting to start early. There is at least one too many layers of complexity in every aspect of what is essentially a roll to hit game. I would prefer simpler administrative and resource management but a richer and more detailed combat system. All in all, not my cup of tea.

I have played through TI3 around 5 or 6 times.  It is a very rewarding experience filled with a great theme, great war mechanics, and a surprising amount of politics.  

Unfortunately it can be difficult to find 3 - 6 players who can set aside an entire evening (6 hours ish) to setup and play. There is a direct conflict between players and backstabbing is common.  This can be wonderful with a great group of players, or challenging with people who take things personal.

The rules are exteremely complex and deep.  New players are at an extreme disadvantage, but an experienced group will have a smooth play and a fantastic story to tell at the end.

We started this game at 4:30, setup and learning took us close to an hour, and then we needed to start packing up just after 9:30; so, all told, we played for about 4 hours and were about 2/3rds of the way to being finished. We'd have needed at least another two hours, probably more. As the game progresses you get more and more ships and more and more resources so you have more and more options and more and more little things to take care of. We were also finally starting to get into conflicts - I was the only one who hadn't. I almost regret choosing the Diplomacy card to avoid starting a conflict - that at least might have been interesting - but, at that point, fighting wasn't going to earn any victory points, it was only going to lose them. Anyway, now that the fighting had started, the turns were going to take even longer as the bigger and bigger fleets rolled into one another and the amount of dice required to resolve combat grew in direct proportion. Which would be fine, if combat had any effect on the score, or helped in anyway to bring the game closer to its conclusion. As it was, fighting was just a dice-rolling interlude, with little meaning to anyone outside the combatants. I admit there was some meaning for other players, but by that point I didn't really care. I just wanted it to be over. I'd sat in a corner for 4 hours, building a fleet of pretty toys, barely doing anything, and, incredulously, and this is the worst part, I was one of the leaders in scoring! Bleh. I could have pushed my fleet out into a scrap, to finally make the game more interesting, and I was about to do that on the next turn, but the scoring system of the game provided no incentive to do so; in fact, just the opposite, as I mentioned earlier. Essentially, I had to get to the point where I just didn't care about the game anymore to finally start doing something active and let winning be damned. That's not good. It would be better if the game's scoring system drove me to act, rather than my acting because the scoring system drove me to sleep....

Finally had the opportunity to play this epic game. One of the few "epic" games I had yet to try. Perhaps it is because I've played the likes of Dune, Rex, Adv Civ, and other long games, that while I enjoyed myself, the game itself did not strike me as being "amazing." There are lots of layers and lots of levers, but ultimately is was plastic dudes on a map, fighting for VPs. Certainly, there is a lot of replayability with even just the base game. Add in the expansions and a group could explore options for years without ever playing the same game twice. Perhaps after a decade, a newer, somewhat streamlined version with all the same options to vary the play experience is due. I feel like something like Blood Rage provides much of the same experience with lots of variety, in a much shorter time frame.

I have mounted the beast! I wasn't sure when I got into gaming if I ever wanted to learn TI3, but BSG and Eclipse both got me interested in space/sci-fi (when I've always preferred fantasy), and it was then preserving myself, and making sure every condition was right when I'd lose my TI virginity (a.k.a. not at a con against 7 other experienced players with every single optional rule).

It's long, but it doesn't feel like it since you're constantly plotting and thinking about out-of-turn secondary abilities. And the game length is justified with the diplomacy, trade and political elements, making it a much richer experience than your regular build-'em-up-and-slam-into-opponent.

Rules overhead was surprisingly low too, with complexity coming from card interactions. Worth a try just to pay homage to all the influences this game took in and spawned. And it's not just the usual suspects. This is the original hybrid; always surprising for the uninitiated to discover that the modern grandaddy of Ameritrash is half-Euro. An engine of Puerto Rico + Axis & Allies, decked out in tons of trimmings.

[b]Puerto Rico[/b] - Freely acknowledged by the designer. Puerto Rico's leeching system is overlaid cleverly onto the action system, with the timing of when you use the Strategic Action being crucial, as you can use Tactical Actions and Action Cards to put off using the Strategic Action if need be (e.g. Tech-ing late if possible). Leeching also isn't free, with the need to prepare Strategy Allocation counters beforehand. The Strategy Cards are also authored very thoughtfully.

[b]Runewars[/b] - Exact same system in moving units around and activating them, though the way of visualizing the retreat in TI3 is pretty cute. Similar map setup rules (also the Distant Suns variant), plus Secret Objective. Pacing in getting VPs is also very similar.

[b]StarCraft[/b] - Planets provide either resource or influence, and you exhaust them to use. Build space dock/factory, then build units.

[b]Axis & Allies[/b] - Exact 1:1 correspondence of units between A&A and TI3 (with only Bombers and Artillery that are missing), making it easier to get into the language. Also, I've been looking for a good, more involved island-hopping game than A&A for a long time, and didn't realize I should be looking in [i]space[/i].

[b]Eclipse[/b] - Trade Contracts are similar to Diplomatic Relations, though of course they're more involved in the granddaddy. Didn't make too good use of TCs and think much of them my first game though; seems a lot more free-form, which I don't like as much. I'm not one for bribes and promises in games. Too many people seem to hold "You promised me 5 turns ago!!!" in as high rigidity as "We need to draw our cards in turn order!!!" and "He's defending, he HAS to roll it; you shouldn't roll for him!!!"

[b]Cosmic Encounter[/b] - So many races and thick card decks!

A more unique element is the voting on codes of laws that change the rules, and other game effects from Political Cards via 'Yea' or 'Nay' on the combined influence (delegates) of your planets.

VPs are earned only at the end of each round, and you can usually only claim 1 objective regardless of how many you achieved, unless you took Imperial II. Or you could play with Bureacracy, which has a more deliberate, keep-your-options-open feel. This is how it should be, clawing your way to 10 VPs, with your options steadily narrowing as low-hanging fruit are cleaned out early (but you steadily grow power), and being really behind if you miss out on a VP. Not like all those Euro games that give you VPs for scratching your ass, with final scores in the 200s. Big on timing if you use Imperial II, getting 1 VP every turn and not falling off the pace, then sprinting to the finish like every marathon you've seen on TV. You'd better have enough juice to reach the finish line because if you don't, you're inviting a 4-front (maybe more) war against yourself.

The forerunner of having a variable number of actions per round is also here. You have to optimize command tokens each round between 3 pools: Command Pool (to make Tactical Actions), Strategy Allocation (to leech off Strategy Cards, and trigger some other tertiary abilities on cards/races) and Fleet Supply (to support more ships on each system). Tough decisions here, based on what you think is going to happen next round with both Strategic and Tactical Actions. And getting only 2 Command tokens each round also means you will be vulnerable after a major offensive push. 

Public objectives help with reducing turtling, incentivizing conflicts in the center, and also uprooting everything in 1 system to get involved in battles, especially after you've already exhausted the corresponding planets (which you can't hoard the resources from). Play boldly, since nothing's irreplaceable except losing your home system.

No game plays the same way. Many games make this boast, but not like this one, where the map is set up differently, there are so many races, the action card and political card decks are thick, the objectives are different, the tech tree lets you adapt, and there are multiple rich avenues of interaction and conflict (attack/diplomacy, trade, political, strategy card drafting/leeching). You rarely need an excuse to push ships around and engage in giant space battles and land their payload for planetary invasions, but the politics, trade, public objectives etc spin out a unique, epic story with every play.

(This rating and comment is based on the system as a whole, assuming the right expansion modules are salted to taste.)

I want to love this game, believe me. I appreciate it for what it is - an epic, sprawling, experience. I just wish it was a better _game_. The victory conditions are too coarse and don't reward fighting enough (even with expansion), the flow of play could be more streamlined, the political stuff does nothing, and the action cards are either horrible or gamebreakers. If I want to play a long game, I don't want THIS much randomness. It has yet to feel like someone has won for a good reason, and I've played it enough times to be sure about that. I even started thinking about my own revision for the game.

First play took a while, but was a lot of fun. There seems to be a lot of variablility and replayability to this game. The strategy cards function like role cards in Puerto Rico and add a nice element to this game, though I'm not sure about the Imperial card. I understand the expansion fixes this. I look forward to many more plays, though I'm hoping the next game goes a little more quickly.

Played TI3-basic once...won't do it again, the base game "Imperial" strategy card is just plain stupid.  I only desire to play TI3 as TI3-SE with the Shattered Empire expansion, that's just the way I like it.  If I had purchased and played the TI3 base game with no expansions, and no "Imperial II" strategy card (#8), and was forced to play only with the original "Imperial" SC#8 card, I would have thrown this game away in disgust.  Also, without the "AoE" option, or if I had been introduced to this game with the ridiculously random and dumb base rules map creation (instead of balanced pre-set maps), or had played the "Distant Suns" option, I would categorically declare this to be one of the worst games ever invented.

What makes this a truly fantastic game are the optional rules, along with the introduction of a strategy based #8 card, "Imperial II," in the expansions.  Some people play this game as a children's "fairy treasure hunt" - others, like me, play this as an actual strategy game.

After the owner of TI3 was asking to try the game for 2 months at least, we finally managed. Took 4-5 hours and wasn't as bad as explaining the rules for 90 minutes. The owner just destroyed us, but that was expected. I like it, it has a nice though slow narrative, so that's probably the epic part. Even with slow pace the downtime is relatively small, so that's the good thing. I think I need to play it a couple of times to form the final opinion, though I think I prefer games of similar style with quicker pace (we played CITOW two days ago and that one I love - bam, bam, bam and it's over).

A wonderful SciFi game at first glance with some serious rule flaws. Luckily, some easy modifications fix it: Just drop the Imperium Card from the game and don't allow stacking counters for the overpowered fighters.

It still takes a bit too long for playing in an evening, even if you make the map a bit smaller than recommended. And some of the game components like the political phase are a bit superfluous. 

But the game is so strong on theme, tactics and intrigue that I like it a lot despite its flaws. It's a Master of Orion as a boardgame, and that's a compliment.

I love the space empire-building theme, as well as many of the mechanics. It's a bit of Axis and Allies, a bit of Puerto Rico, a bit of Magic...

Why not just flip a coin at the outset? The many variants and attempted fixes haven't solved the core problems with this game.

I have gotten two four player games in now and I love this game. I'm not too fond of the random objective cards but the next time we play we are shooting for 5 or 6 players and going to use the Age of Empires variant. 

I have now played 6, 5, and 3 player games as well and played with shattered empire. SE makes this game a ten, unfortunately without it, TI3 will be an 8. But I still really like this game!

Just had my first game, and I must say I'm pretty impressed: game lasted for about ten hours (we were slow, 3 noobs in the game), but I didn't feel them wizz past .Aweseome components, too .
*edit* after second (12 hours) game, I must say the scoring is a bit strange, and the ending of the game anticlimatic . Imperial getting 2 points is a bit too much imho.

For me - game looked extremely nice... but was pretty much dissapointing. I can't say why, but most probably - it was to random as per my view. Additionally - it takes ages from one player to another when there is a kind of battle. At the end - we got quite bored... and this is not what game should be, right?

Probably the most fun board game I've ever played.  Lots of strategic options, high replayability, and the game seems built specifically with the ability to modify and tweak in mind.  Can't believe it took me so long to find it, though I'm glad I waited for the 3rd edition, as the other editions may not have been quite my style.

Oh Twilight Imperium, how I want to rate you a 10... Twilight Imperium is everything you could ever want in a 4X space board game and more. It has everything from resource management to politics and fleet logistics to a robust tech tree. Everything about the game seems like a smooth transition from a PC game to a board game. That being said... A game with this kind of depth is a real time investment. Every time we want to play a 5+ player game we have to plan a day out, while that's not a bad thing, it's also not a good thing and makes playing the game that much harder. Game play is a solid 10/10, but the time it takes to play this game knocks it down quite a few pegs.

I liked this game, the theme is great, who couldn't love space plus epic battles with fleets zooming around and taking planets. The downsides however are firstly that it's a hugely long game...too long really...our game took 7 hours. This wouldn't be too bad if you felt you were making significant progress, but often a couple of sides would battle back and forth continuously over a single hex with very little outcome. There just aren't enough ways to earn VP's easily, and the Imperial Card becomes a 'must take'. If only all my battling had seen more in the way of VP's (I was trying to take a planet for my secret objective), I might have felt the time was worth it.

If a version was brought out that was quicker with more VP access, I'd be loving it...

[2012-09-23]
A Starcraft és az Eclipse után túl magas lécet kellett volna a Twilight Imperiumnak megugrania és nem sikerült neki, de sajnos még csak rezegtetnie a lécet sem, pedig a fent említett két játéknak is vannak hibái. A Twilight Imperium szabályismertetése, ha nem is strarcrafti hosszúságú, azért a sok apróság miatt majdnem olyan szintű és minimum 1 órás. A játékot véletlenszerűen húzott űrlapok lerakásával kezdjük, sajnos itt rendesen beszól a szerencse. Nagyon sok múlhat kedvező kártyák (termelő, befolyást adó bolygókkal ellátott) húzásán, mert nyilván azt a kezdő bolygója mellé fogja tenni a játékos, persze lehet a másik mellé is berakni gyengébb lapokat, de ezzel magunk számára is megengedjük ezt a lehetőséget az ellenfeleinknek. A játék parancsjelzőkkel zajlik. 8 stratégia akció közül kettőt választunk négy játékos esetén a Puerto Ricóban megismertek szerint, ezek számozottak, amik meg is határozzák a sorrendünket a játékban. Mindegyiküknek van egy elsődleges és egy másodlagos, gyengébb akciójuk, ez utóbbiakat mindenki parancsjelző befizetésével végrehajthatja. A játékban nincs kereskedés és érdekes módon az űrcsaták sem hoznak győzelmi pontot. Viszont ezen stratégia akciók egyike 2 pontot ad. 10 pont elérése a cél, amit még körönként feljövő 1 pontot érő tulajdonképpen egyszerű célok teljesítésével lehet elérni. Ezen felül mindenki egy titkos célt húz, ami 2 pontot ad, ami nem tűnik nagy szerencsefaktornak, de azért mindenképp jelentős, mert nagyon fej-fej mellett haladunk a pontszerzésben. Így kicsit olyan céltalannak tűnik a játék. A stratégiai akciók is egyértelműen sorrendbe állíthatók jóságuk szerint. Az egységek számának szabályozása és a csaták szerintem jól megoldottak. Nem könnyű, de sajnos ki lehet esni a játékból, ez nem túl jó pont. Nem rossz játék a TI, de számomra kevés jó ötletet tartalmaz a fent említett két játékhoz képest és a sok holtidő és hosszú játékidő szerintem nem igazán éri meg. 4 óra alatt sem sikerült végigjátszanunk az első játékunkat és még 1 óra tuti benne volt. Szóval nem tudom mikor ülnék le hozzá megint, de előbb játszanék a két fent megnevezettel, mint a TI-vel.

A very good and engaging game. With the right group, there is lots of tension and very difficult desicions to make. And sometimes, picking Imperial is NOT the best strategy...

RATING: 9
Yes, the euro role-selection mechanics is somewhat forced upon gameplay. Yes, the VP system might encourage gamey conducts, favour rather weird deals, and result in anti-climatic wins by rather passive players with no dominating board position. But this is all the same such a grand visual and intellectual experience, conveying all the flavour and scope of the most ambitious space operas. One of my all time favourites.

[b]Best Game I Don't Already Own Award[/b]

WHOA! Only played this with expansions, and I was really impressed. I see loads of potential here.

Rules are pretty simple but theres lots of FUN complexity with the upgrades, cards, and LOADS of factions to play. I can tell there's a lot of replayability in this box IF you have a great group for it.

I was advised that it's pretty difficult to come back from a point deficit in this game, and that's a possible weakness, but good play seems to be able to secure you a point more often than not, and it also seems possible to go on a sprint with a big move and still win, as long as you don't consistently neglect your scoring.

And in general, the difficulty in coming back seems to be necesarry to create the desperate scramble for the victory points -- the visible missions really force things to happen, which is GREAT, because otherwise this would be a much more standstill game.

[b]VS RuneWars[/b]: I dunno, I suspect I'll like this more ultimately and that's mostly due to all of the crazy factions. But RuneWars has so much cool stuff that I think the two games happily coexist side by side despite scratching a similar itch.

[b]VS Eclipse:[/b] I think these are actually more different than I'd heard before playing TI3 -- sure there's plastic ships and loads of hexes, but the main takeaways in Eclipse are exploration and customizing your ship. Customizing your ship especially is a lot of fun and Eclipse's claim to glory.

But this games flavor suits my personal tastes much more, with its WILD personality and bursting flavor -- Eclipse is pretty solid, but feels like a void empty shell next to this.

[b]VS Starcraft: The Board Game[/b]: Starcraft feels like a smaller scale skirmish, but it's really solid for me. TI3 I suspect will do the "epic large player count" thing better I think I'll like Starcraft more for a 2-4 player skirmish. I don't know, haven't tried epic 6 player Starcraft but I think with a big epic long game like that you'd want more going on -- Starcraft has better combat with less generic units and more exciting tactical manuevers, but TI3 feels better built to handle an epic scale game with its extra elements of negotiation, politics, trade, etc.

[b]VS Cosmic Encounter[/b]: Here's this games real competition for me, and where it probably flat out loses -- I was surprised by this (that I would wind up comparing the two as similar), but I think Cosmic Encounter successfully distills all of the high points I like about this game and crams it into a much more playable game. Yeah you lose the epic build ups, but you get everything else delivered to you so fast. A game of Cosmic Encounter is like an "extract-of-TI3" being automatically pumped through your veins on demand. 

So in a sense, playing TI3 was AWESOME (one play gets it into my top 10) -- but on the other hand, it also made me appreciate Cosmic Encounter, already my most legendary game, even more.

[b]Bottom Line:[/b] Not good, but GREAT strategy game that's dripping with asymmetry and player interaction, so I naturally and automatically love it.

(5 Design + 3 Enjoyment)

Max rating potential: 10. Need to play more.

I have a hard time rating this as a stand alone piece as the game is so vastly improved by the usual Fantasy Flight Expansion fix.  I'd be hard pressed to play this without Shattered Empires.  The improvements in the expansion specifically address the well sited flaws in the base game.  

The concepts are great and this really should have worked out of the box (Especially as they had two other tries to get it right), but it just has too many flaws to justify playing this on its own.  

TI3 is a fantastic work in progress. On it's own tt really should get a 4, but what works in the new version is so great that I'm hard pressed to say I don't like it.  See TI3.5 for the playable version.  (Which while even playable has some problems).

I had some problems getting used to this game. After two or three plays I was not sure whether I liked it. But then it clicked and now I think this is the greatest game I ever played.

This game is rated really high for me for several reasons.  I like war games.  I like strategy games. I like sci-fi.  I like pvp.  I like land grab and area control. I like quests.  I love the political aspect of this game. I love epically long games with millions of little pieces and cards. I love Euro-games that are all about victory points.  And TI is a points game disguised in a really cool sci-fi war game theme.

What's not to like? For me, this game has it all. A little on the longer side, but if you get some experienced gamers together, you can play it in a decent amount of time.

Great fun, but ONLY if you play with people who will actually do combat at some point -- I quit playing with my group because they'd spend all night building up and never attacking.

After a couple of plays, I like this game quite a bit. There is definitely some luck involved, but not so much that skillful play can't beat it. Dreadfully, ridiculously long--this one needs the Game Cube, desperately.

Rating based on two plays. It sure has a pile of rules, but it was fun to play. However, the complexity and length requires that I not play it more than "sporadically", hence the "6" rating... Oh gawd! My second game took 8 hours. Sure, up to 1.5 hours of that was going over the rules at the start, but we didn't actually finish the game, so it probably would have been 8 hours of play time. Too long!

Like others, I strongly recommend the Shattered Empire expansion. Even with that, I think it needs some tweaks to the Strategy Cards and a few other rules. (Fortunately, this is easy to do, and the game design even seems to invite it.) With that, I'd raise it to a 9. Downsides: it takes a while to explain the rules, and it takes a long time to setup and play. Once you know the rules, though, the game is simple. It takes the Axis & Allies combat model, research and movement; adds in the Puerto Rico role cards; and the board layout of Settlers of Catan.

Recommendations: don't use the Tech cards, but instead have a check sheet that you can also use to track the Unit capabilities. Also, provide a list of the Strategy Card abilities so everyone can read them where they sit. And have beads to put on exhausted planets instead of flipping them over.

I mean, I guess I get this in the sense that it's cool that you've got tech trees and this long-ish arc to develop your race and they're all different. The problem is that it seems that it takes an awfully long time to get to the real action, and that you're really building up for three hours to make a desperate gamble to make the move to satisfy your own personal victory condition. I'm not a huge fan of games that take over three hours to play, so that's part of it, but I just didn't feel especially drawn in.

Anyone who knows my taste in games knows that I avoid long games. I don't want to be stuck for several hours playing a game I may not enjoy and will likely never play again when I could be playing several games I know I enjoy. There are exceptions, but a game longer than two hours needs to be well loved for me to even try it. I knew that Twilight Imperium took a lot longer than two hours. I didn't know whether I'd enjoy it. 

I loved it. Almost immediately I saw how it integrated so much of what I like. It's asymmetric, intuitive, interactive, open, dynamic, replayable, and yes, long, but oh so worth it. There's none of what I don't like in Fantasy Flight's games, where too often game design pales in comparison to production, complexity masks otherwise simple decisions, and stories are told rather than created. In Twilight Imperium, [i]everything[/i] works.

The length is part of what makes it so great. Because no one wants to get into a conflict too early, seemingly small things like establishing a colony here and building a ship dock there can be perfectly defensible on the surface, but everyone can see the meaning behind the manoeuvring. There are moments where you know that your neighbour is pushing you, but you aren't sure if meeting him with force is worth it because you know it will change the game. At the same time, you worry about the consequences of inaction. Everyone has their hand on a grenade, waiting for the right moment, and then someone goes a bit too far and it's total war. Once the first pin is pulled, the game explodes. And amid all of this, you have to position yourself to win, which is not, after all, about imperium so much as gamesmanship.

By giving this game a 10, I'm not saying that it's perfect; however, the experiences I've had playing this game are among the best I've had in the hobby.  I still reminisce with other players about the climactic battles and dramatic moments we shared.

Sadly, my post college life with work and family doesn't lend itself to the long play sessions this game requires, and I have since sold it.  Nevertheless, this game will always have a fond place in my heart.

Well, here's an odd case.  Like a Wagnerian opera, it's big and bold, and very, very slow.  You get tension, but one wonders if there's as much of a payoff as there should be for that much time and effort.  Do you end up really enjoying the evening as much as you would have with other games?  Lots of super-cool details, no doubt.

The big fat gigantic mother of all board games, this is on the longest, most extensive, stratigic, and massive games you'll ever play. And consequently it's one of the best.

RATING: 7.5
I certainly enjoy playing it, but it's not my favorite.  I think there's just not quite enough incentive to attack, for one thing.  Exacerbating this is that combat is so dicey - I was brought up on A&A, where, due to larger numbers of units, combat can be predicted with some accuracy.  Do I recommend it?  Well, that depends who's asking.  If you're a wargamer, then no.  If you're a light gamer who thinks the bits look cool, then sure, but be sure and read the rules carefully.  And prepare for a long game.  If you're a general gamer (playing some Euros, some wargames, etc.) who wants an epic space game, then you're in luck.

EDIT: Sold off.

This rating is based on my first play of the game.  I went into this game not sure what to think, but knowing that I really wanted to try it.  I was not disappointed.  the game was very good.  I like that, even though there are six players in the game, all players are involved in everyone's turns because of the secondary powers of the different strategies.  I would definitely like to play this one again sometime.

I've played Twilight Imperium three times now and so far every game has consisted of three "steps":
1. "Wow! The components are so awesome! And it's actually fun to set the game up!"
2. Four to seven hours of pure boredom. Slow and not the least bit interesting.
3. "Thank God it's over, where's Blokus?"

Not my game at all, unfortunately, but I suppose I could give it one more chance if there's a game planned and they desperately need one more player.

This game is about 3 hours too long for the enjoyment it pays out.  It's a decent 4X game and if it was streamlined down to 2 to 3 hours, it would be great.  Traded away since in the same time I could play 8 scenarios of Combat Commander and have more exciting tales to retell afterwards...and 8 different stories.  Similarly I could play an entire game of any one of a number of my 18XX games and be on the edge of my seat--often right til the end.  The end of TI is kind of dull and anti-climactic.  It's not that it's a bad game, but about halfway through I begin to wish I was playing something else, instead of looking toward another 2 or 3 hours of TI.

Twilight Imperium has just about everything I want in a game. Sure, the beginning round or so is predictable expansion (which you can simulate if it really bugs you), but after that the game opens up and becomes a tangled mass of decisions and possibilities. The randomness of combat dice rolls and cards drawn is balanced by the euro-esque strategies of role selection, efficient action management and long term technology and goal planning, with those goals being impacted by your opponents' actions. The level of player interaction is so far beyong simple invasions and combat rolls. The expansion adds heaps of new options that you can insert in to play or leave out as easily as Firefox plugins. Twilight Imperium is an experience, but unlike a lot of 'experience games' there are genuine layers and layers of actual game at its core. Instantly one of my favorites.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Right off the bat I will state that I have never played this game without the "Shattered Empires" expansion.  And yet, whether it is fair or not, I will rate the base game according to the differences that were described to me by people who were familiar with both the original and the expansion, but I will reserve most of my comments for the "Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition - Shattered Empires" entry.  As great as this game is, it sounds to me like there were some serious flaws with it that were corrected by the expansion, making the expansion pretty much a necessity.  With "Shattered Empires", I rate this game a 9/10.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8/10

I actually enjoy it a lot.  You do have to have the right crowd, since it is somewhat of an 'experience' game (i.e. you can get brutally hosed through no fault of your own, and you have to take it with good humor).  The biggest down side of course, is that it takes forever and you can never finish.  If it finished in 4-5 hours my rating would go up.

An interesting game, fun at first. But in the end fundamentally flawed. The last time I played, the game ended in as an hung game over a rules dispute. (it had stopped being fun a couple hours before that anyways).

The secret strategy cards are all too hard, and totally unbalanced (for instance, getting 6 GFs on mecatol rex is vastly easier than getting 4 dreadnaughts there). Even if you think that beating down on players who were lucky enough to draw a good race is a "balancing mechanism" (which it isn't), there's no way to do that when you don't know what someone's secret objective is.

I won't be wasting any more time playing this.

Long, very long but nice to see and probably to play. The mechanism of the game is apparently complex as it contains a lot of details but I can say nothing more as we played with a lot of wrong rules.
Played again, this time with right rules (but are PDS too strong?); 6.5 hours!!! the game was starting to become interesting when we dropped it !!!! We need to start at 8 AM to finish a game. Vote confirmed. Seems to be too statical as the first 4 round are for positioning purpose only.

Based on 4 plays.  None of the plays left me feeling satisfied like a good clean, complete game took place.  It always feels like we had to tweak this and that with house rules.

Have played it only once (so far) and won as the Mentak Coalition. Tied on 9 points when the game ended on the 8th turn with Imperium Rex, but won the tie-break by having fulfilled more objectives.

Absolutely superb game, it has combat, politics, diplomacy, a tech tree, action cards, resource management, different unit types, alliances, trade and with a variable board and variable victory point conditions, longevity as well. The game I played did take 8 hours, so for those who do not like this then it will be a problem. We arranged a Sunday afternoon expecting this so it wasn't an issue.

Edit: Played a few more times now and still enjoy this immensely.

This is a tough one.  I played it this weekend and I really liked it but the length is a huge barrier for me.  I can't imagine wanting to devote 6+ hours to play this game again.  If it clocked in at 3 hours or less I might have rated it an 8.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Many call this a 4X space game, but players do not truly develop their civilizations, rather they simply build armadas. As such, it's really an area control game hidden behind a whole lot of smoke and mirrors; more "Diplomacy in Space" than "Masters of Orion the Board Game". Still, it offers vast degree asymmetrical play and a wealth of optional elements. As much a delightful toybox as it as a game.

I'm guessing I never play this.  Certainly not until I get a bigger table.

Hey hey, finally played it (3/26/11)!  That's one "Great White Whale" game taken care of.  Lots of fun and, amazingly, a 9 hour game flew by.  (Probably shouldn't take 9 hours, but the 4 hours on the box is absurd.)  Plenty of flaws and I don't think I'd play it a lot more times, but was well worth the play.  Can't get too into the competition as their are some major balance issues, single card issues, the Imperial card issue, etc.  In our game, War Suns were probably too easy to get and dominated the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Superb game that captures the feel of controlling an epic space empire. The only problems I see with the game are the high random factors and extreme length of the game.

If they could have made it more "Euro"-like --streamlining the rules, minimizing randomness, and reducing playing time -- (but NOT a Euro!) it would probably be one of the best games in my eyes.

As it stands, it is still one of the best only because it is unique and captures the feel that I love. Plus it is very modible and expandable and features INSANE replayability, which is essential to me.

The game is a 9.25 with the expansions, but without it is only an 8.75. I just decided to average the ratings for this score.

RATING: 5.5
This is a visually stunning game. Absolutely beautiful, and its sheer size is dominating. My rating is based on only 3 plays - 6-player, 6+ hour games, only one of which actually ended with a player victory. The others ended for lack of time. Lots going on but not all that much action. Fighting wars doesn't usually earn VPs and non-conflict wins are possible (but make for a boring game).

Twilight Imperium was my first boardgame purchase you could say.  It really helped solidify how huge and awesome the world of boardgames is.  The pieces, components, artwork, rules, you name it, are well produced.  Watching a galatic struggle go from its humble beginnings to epic endings is always a fun experience.  Always a great game to play.

On Shattered Empire: To me, it seems that fantasy flight produces games, sells, them, then comes around with a very overpriced expansion.  However, call me a completist, I always have to get expanisons to games I enjoy.  The expansion doesn't add much, but it adds fun, albeit small, additions.

RATING: 5
A game I would love to love. But some variant to negate the power of the Imperial card will be needed. As the game is written in the rules, the game is too much of a dance around the golden Imperial card, and that is a shame, as the game itself is very nice. You will need to be on your toes in terms of making your moves, or the game will drag on for too long.

Great game but it takes an absolute age to play. It's very well produced - I particularly like the different races available of which there are ten to choose from and they all play quite differently. All the game components are excellent and feature artwork of a very high standard. The problem with this game is finding at least two other players who are willing to give up the best part of a day to play the thing with. It's also quite a brutal game on people who haven't played it before and a lot of explanation has to take place. I also feel in regards to this that because of the sheer volume of rules (over 40 pages in the rulebook) a lot of allowances for inexperience should be made and hopefully there's someone in the group who has a talent for explaining games. It's a very rewarding game after repeated plays however as people become more familiar with the system of play and which tactics to employ (just like any other good game in that regard).

This is a tough one to write.  I really like this game because of its complexity, the fluff, the components, etc.  It's a fun game.  However, it's not one I can play often due to the time investment and after playing it the second time I am beginning to feel the rules are a little flawed.  Check out the reviews on this one.  They are pretty spot-on when talking about the game's strong and weak points.

This review is from playing twilight imperium with both shards of the throne and shattered empire expansions.

It is THE EPIC space empire board game. Explore planets, research tech, build a might armada of ships, fight your foes, ally yourself with others, vote for political agendas that can change everything. This game has really really good potential, but without homebrew rules for victory points it is actually quite bad. Victory point rules in basic game is broken (does not work at all), it gets a little better with expansions, but it is still horrible.

With our homebrew variant:
Start with 10 victory cards face up
Seed in more conflict orientated victory cards (less of turtling cards like tech and spend x resources)
After round 3 and onwards game can end. Check at the end of status phase of round 3 if game has ended, one with most VP wins.
Use voice of the council and artifacts that give victory points on planets.
Each player can always claim only one victory card at the end of each status phase (and in addition they can claim secret objective or premiminary objective)

If the victory point rules would have been good this game deserves a 10, but when it requires homebrew rules in order to play I have to reduce the score by 1

Having a game this epic with all of it's suppliments and option rules has given my game group nearly infinite ways to play and enjoy 4x like never before.  Highly recommended for those that enjoy spending rather copious amounts of time with friends: backstabbing, trash-talking, and rubbing sweet victory in each others faces . . . at least until it is your turn for humble pie.  A game not for the faint of heart.

No other game is as great as this one when I, and my gaming group, are in the mood for a ginormous play session with a massively heavy game.  The 3rd Edition magically blend the thematic excitement of American-style games, with the German-style elegant mechanisms.  Nothing short of a masterpiece.

I really like this game. 

My thoughts on the Initiative/Imperial combo. Personally I think it's kind of clever. We all thought it would end the game faster and was a given move, but it's cleverly balanced by putting the player that is involved behind the eight-ball as they don't have a strategy card that helps them with other objectives. Also the person that takes Imperial could end the game before they get their bonus points. So taking Imperial is not a sure-fire victory.

My interest in this game dates from its sold-out second edition.

We use the following two-player variant:
* remove 10 tiles from the game (4 empty systems, 1 asteroid field and 5 random tiles)
* Use the 2 player galaxy as defined in the TI2 rulebook page 5
* Do not use the "Initiative" Strategy Card, so swap the Speaker token between game rounds, and use only 7 Strategy Cards in total
* Each player selects 2 Strategy Cards, the three remaining ones get Bonus tokens like in the 5-player game
* Use the "Age of Empires" Variant, together with "Imperial II" (this is also called the "Ancient Throne" variant)

I think Twilight Imperium is a fantastic game, but it has a huge flaw of being WAY TO LONG! I played a 5 man game for 6 hours and there was no conceivable end. The game gives huge rewards to the player that knows the rules inside and out. The way to learn that is to play, I would say, about 50 hours of the game. Thing is I have lots of other games I would rather be playing during that 50 hours.

An updated version of TI2. Most of the new mechanics are a welcome change and the lack of bookeeping is a huge plus. The threaded turns make for a much more interactive experience. Rating has dropped a few points due to a number of silly issues that never should have made it past playtesting. The Variant/FAQ probably add a point to the rating, but out of the box, the game has some flaws which will just turn some people off. With a few House Rules, the game can be absolutely fantastic. I think with a bit more playtesting, it could have been a real gem out of the box instead of a 'diamond in the rough'.

Broken in so many ways.... The role choice mechanism isn't a choice for the first two players. A few planets does not an empire make in my book. Trading...ick.

This review is based on one play, it was also a rules learning game for all players but 1.  We started our game at 3pm, I knew it was going to be long, I was hoping we would have begun at noon.  The end result was a stalemate (people gave up) at 4:30 am.  What happened?  I took imperial any chance I got until I was at 8 victory points, everyone then ganged up on me and wiped me out leaving me at 9 victory points.  The next highest person was then also wiped out before he could end the game while the other players sat around at 1-3 victory points.  After that occured the remaining players said screw this and ended the game. I personally felt there needs to be MORE victory points in the game, you wiped out a player should grant an automatic 1 or 2 victory points etc.  Was it a decent game?  Yeah, it was interesting seeing other games mechanics used in a long winded war game.  Did they all work, not really, some of them felt way too fiddly.  There was abit too much micro management for my liking, I spent pretty much most of the game trying to make guys, get carriers to them, then move them to uncolonized planets before I got gangbanged.  For what its worth its just WAY to freaking long, but its long and slow.  Not a whole lot went on the entire game yet it took us a retarded amount of time.  All and all, it seemed like a game where in turtling, picking imperial and having lucky planets around your home to colonize wins you the game.  Very much a game of beat up the leader.

01/13/07: We played our first complete game with six players from start to finish!! Took us about 9 hours. Lowered the rating from 9 to 8 because of the a) looong playing time, b) the problems that arise from the imperial strategy-card (in this case, if some people (e.g. me) take the card whenever they can and other people passing on it and then ganging up on the people with the most VP...which generally leads to more of a) ) and the general fact that I am not a very aggressive gamer.
08/20/06: My impression after the first play (three players) is *very* good! This game combines elements of american- and euro-style games in a very clever way and the quality of the components is stunning, to say the least. The very clear and well organized rules are also worth mentioning (especially for FFG, since Arkham Horror´s rulebook almost drove me insane - pun intended). The game is quite long, but I guess after two or three plays it will move along quite nicely. I should also mention, that just preparing the first play is very timeconsuming: There are lots of tokens to punch out and bucketloads of plastic-miniatures to cut from the sprues. I guess, that this took me approximately six hours total.The game is very immersive and easy to learn (but not simple) and I am really looking forward to our next play!

I have mixed feelings about this game. I'd like to love the game because it's got some really nice elements, but I have a lot of problems with it.

First off, the game is way too long. It usually takes around 6-8 hours to complete a game of TI. This is much longer than any game should be, but if it were just this that was wrong with the game, I would still love it. The main shortcoming of the game is that victory points - the mechanism for winning the game - are almost completely dissociated from what happens on the board, at least in the base game. What I mean by this is that what happens on the board will only slightly influence the victor of a game, and engaging in warfare is the worst possible move you can take, bar-none.

The base game offers no victory points for succeeding at warfare, and gives you a ton of victory points for doing things like building up, turtling and not building an army. What this means is that the game essentially gives you a really intricate battle system that sounds like a lot of fun, gives you a dynamic board which will be the stage for all this battle, and then rewards you for not using any of it and just staying in your little corner of the galaxy for 6-8 hours.

I've heard that the expansion (Shattered Empire) fixes a lot of my problems with the game, but as I don't own it, it's hard for me to say. My advice, then, is that either you buy the base game and the expansion right away, or you steer clear from it altogether. If you're not willing to shell out the money for the expansion, you're just going to be frustrating yourself for the better part of a day.

My rating is based on the game as presented out of the box, which I think is either broken or arbitrary, especially given the length of time it takes to play the game. With some of the suggested alternate rules, my rating is probably a touch higher. The bottom line is that this game is too long and too random for my tastes. The space theme just reminds me that I could be playing Merchant of Venus.

TI3 does so many things well.  The action allowance system is well balanced, the tech tree is awesome, and the Puerto-Rico-style role selection is always a crowd pleaser.  I appreciated that victory points didn't always come from combat, and it leads you into different strategies throughout the game.

The one aspect that fell a little flat to me was politics.  I love the idea of negotiating and passing legislation for the galaxy.  But, at least in our game, the legislation was typically pretty underwhelming, so it wasn't really worth taking the politics action.

But other than that, I liked everything about the game.  It's definitely ahead of [thing=72125][/thing] for me, and probably even passes [thing=175155][/thing] to become my favorite space 4X game.  Now, if only it was a little easier to get to the table...

As a previous player of TI2 (rating = 8), I definitely put this game at a 10.  The game mechanics are smooth and player-interactive.  The components are just awesome!  Each game is so different that the replay value is very high.  The command decision choices are numerous makes the game rich.  Sure, there are a few things to tweak or options to use, but nothing seems broken to me.  This is a regular favorite with our game group (typically six-player games).  The TI3 Shattered Empires expansion makes it better with fixes to a few problems and great enhancements!

This is the ultimate game for me. There's an incredible amount of depth, strategy, and options here. Variable player powers, variable phase order, political posturing, and a remarkably rich theme all in one box. The biggest drawback is the playtime, but no other game feels quite as epic as Twilight Imperium.

Unlike many others, I feel that the core game works just fine and actually makes for a shorter game when played by the basic rules, but there is a certain cycle that players follow.

While I still very much enjoy the game, especially the space opera theme, unique races, and the overall concept; I have to admit that the game is showing its age. FFG has shown in more recent releases that it's capable of delivering an epic experience with far more streamlined mechanics. To date, nothing has matched the epic scale of Twilight Imperium, but at this point it may be time for a new edition.

Twilight Imperium is a game unlike any other I've experienced in terms of the level of time commitment, choices, aspects, and overall scope, yet winning the game boils down to luck of the draw (in terms of what victory conditions come out via your secret goals and public goals) and a certain amount of kingmaking. Make no mistake, this is a game that makes you invested, primarily due to the amount of time you take getting invested in your ships and the galaxies being developed, but at the end of the day, it asks a lot of you and seems to leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth and a day come and gone.

After 1 1/2 plays, I can't say I am blown away, but it is a fun game.  Can really bog down with combat and I was kind of let down by the diplomacy, which was close to non-existent.  You can also get completely screwed by the setup, but that is kind of minor compared to other things.

I would love to rate it a 9, but I feel that from game to game the amount of combat can fluctuate greatly depending on strategies.  It is possible to do very well while rarely fighting at all.  If combat were a bit more central to the mechanics, I would rate this a 9.

Long game, though it doesn't feel like it because I'm invested for the duration.  It may take all day, but that day feels like Christmas.

My main complaint: the victory points are weak in terms of theme.  I'd prefer it if victory was directly tied to control of Mecatol Rex, or other specific goals that would enable a stronger narrative.  Maybe the Lazax scenarion in the Shards of the Throne expansion would solve that?

Played 4x now (HaHa), still great

The "Imperial card" should be recognized for what it is. That is a means to keep the game in balance for the non-agresive races. Agressive races, who merely follow their programmed scheme of building up and attacking without ever "sacrificing" a turn to take up the Imperial card, are bound to fail and shouldn't wonder, when they're losing.

This game is famous, and for good reason. So big! So much table space needed! Needs so many players to live up to full potential! Such a heavy, huge, expensive box! So complicated to learn/teach! Takes so long to set up/tear down/play! And so, SO FUN.

This is a game that's a pain in the ass to find the time, space, and committed players to make a game of it happen, but is just SO worth it on the rare occasion you can make it happen. Mechanically, the game is just beautiful... there are so many ways to play, your choices flavor play so heavily, the ending typically feels satisfying win or lose, this game is just amazing. I wish to Christ someone would make a digital version so you could online matchmaking, because this game is just so damn fun, but you can own it for years and never get a chance to play it.

A truly epic game, both in theme as in game length. Try to rule the galaxy with a combination of warfare, technology and politics.

In 1 game you'll be fighting wars on a couple of fronts, trying to stay ahead in the technology race, while in another game you may be getting rich on trade and win by not firing a single shot. Amazingly, this game tries out dozens of ideas, and most of them work out great. Truly an accomplished design!

Given the scope and length of this game I was expecting that we would all be stumbling over rules the whole game, just learning as we played. But we all grasped the rules pretty easily and proceeded to have a good, tense game.

Played my first game of this and I cannot wait to get it to the table again. The diplomacy, the combat, the politics, the theme, its all there and its all perfect. Easily rated a 10 and I would rate it higher if I could. I wish I could get more people to look past the time commitment and get them to play because they are missing out.

I don't like the idea of the 2VP Strategy card (we used the SE expansion ones) and I don't think I ever have a desire to play with the original one.

My new favorite game!!  Trying to conquer the known galaxy (and your friends) through military action, politics, trade and subversion was never so much fun.  A great game for armchair generals, politicians, tradesmen and diplomats.

This game may seem big and daunting at first, but once you begin learning the rules I find that it rolls along pretty well.

I’ve won the last two of the three games that my group has played: once (without firing a shot) as the Xxcha Kingdom and again (with minor military engagement) as the Yssaril Tribes.

I can't wait to try the Shattered Empires expansion.

I really like this game. I like that a person can't win without a balanced strategy. The first couple of times, my brother built a huge war machine and conquered planet after planet. He was surprised when he didn't win.

Out of the first three times I played, I won the second and the third, which always makes me like a game more.

Long, complex, involving and [b]totally worth it[/b].

TI should stand for Time Investment.  It requires one to play and more importantly, it requires one for the learning curve.  It can be harsh on first time players to play a 6-8 hour game to just learn it.  I didn't really feel confident in the game until my 3rd play.  That being said, it is epic in scope and a great experience.

Played once. Loved it. Obviously, it's the kind of game I'd like to play once or twice a year, consistently. I'm going to wait until I've played it at least one more time to put more thoughts into my comments. Suffice it to say that I love what it accomplishes in terms of a grand-scale game including everything great about Euro games and conflict games. Yeah, it's long, but I had a blast in my one play trying to plot the best time to build, move, research, attack, and of course trade. 

Can't wait to play it again. If it stands up to multiple plays, I imagine it will eventually be in my Top 10. I'm considering asking Santa Claus for it this Christmas. I'm just so nervous that it will sit too long between plays. We shall see...

This game is one of my favorites. It is a lot of fun, though definitely need a little time and space to play. The base games strategies left me with the rating, if you buy this game you should definitely buy Shattered Glass Expansion, as it greatly improves upon the base game.

Set up time is a real negative in my opinion too, but, not much you can do to change this... there is a lot going on and because of that you need a lot of pieces and a lot of cards.

Solid game, I love playing it, and am glad I bought the expansions!

Extremely disappointed. Very tedious, long, overwhelmingly fiddly and random game, with a bunch of tacked on ugly mechanics, which, despite its complexity, manages to stay pretty light strategy-wise with Euro-ish victory point system that makes no sense, is random and does not create any meaningful narrative whatsoever.

The praised "politics" system is ridiculous and feels incredibly forced. Why doesn't Diplomacy need any titles, voting or politic cards?

This is what a perfect game looks like.  This is the third edition so it better be good.  Excellent miniatures, cards, board, rules, options, etc.  A blast all the way around.  It plays long (3 to 4 hours) but that's to be expected for a game like this.  The price tag is pretty step, but I would rather pay $20 to $30 extra to see a game done right than to have a good game have bad components.  If you can afford this game, you'll like it.

Only played once.  This seems like a game whose fun-ness depends heavily on who you play with.  And it's a chaotic game; you have frustratingly little control over your destiny.

Really I can't think of much to say than 'TI GOOD!'.

It's NOT a war game. It's a threat-of-war game with players chasing victory conditions for points. The plastic armies are like the armies of the US and Russia circa 1970s. Large, dangerous, and only for use in proxy-war skirmishes. Full scale war devastates all parties involved.

A fun game that takes too long to play. If it were shorter I would play it often, but It's hard to get my gaming group to take it off the shelf. this puts it at an 8.

Additionally, the combat is decided by rolling dice. Which for me personally is quite disappointing considering the depth of the rest of the games strategy. this brings it to a solid 7 for me.

A true victory point build, expand, and conquer, epic beast of a game. Great fun all around. Set aside a full day if you want to play this with 4+. It is nowhere near balanced, but when I play a game like TI I'm not looking for balance, I'm looking for an immersive experience and a fun time conquering my foes! There is no doubt in my mind that this is the grand daddy of Starcraft and that Starcraft tries to be a more compact version of TI focusing mostly on the combat side of things.

As an experience, this is a fun game.  Lots of activity, lots of things to do.  Makes for a fun game night.

As a game, this is horrible.  Way too many problems with the rules.  The special powers are terribly unbalanced.  The setup encourages hunkering down and eking out a win rather than going out and seizing it.

The tech tree is both boring and poorly thought out.  The action cards just don't add.  The political cards are a joke.

RATING: 5
Wow, this is a beast.  Not suitable for non gamers and people with short attention spans.  Quite free and open, and many different paths to kick some ass.  Fun, but long.  Hopefully, the playing time reduces with more experience.  A flawed game that takes forever.  It has some fantastic ideas buried in the game, but the flaws in the game just make it almost unbearable to spend the time needed to play it.  I think I may have to wait for Twilight Imperium IV.   The lack of playtesting is clearly evident(sigh and double sigh).  It contains all of the elements a game this long should have... it just wasn't hashed out enough.  Shame on  you!

Note:  I really have a disdain for house rules, but the ISC played out of the box is just too much for me to handle.  I don't mind the principle of it, its the fact so many power cards can influence it, and not every person is guaranteed it the same number of times.  It also seems unnecessary.  The game already has a timer with the objective cards!!!!  This is the only game that I refuse to play without some house rule.  Most games I refuse to take seriously unless they contain no house rules.

An abortion of a game. This thing didn't only turn me off to Twilight Imperium. It made me question my love of all space opera. I was watching Force Awakens, watching Han die, and all I could think was...how did the Imperial Card make it past a single playtest...is that why the Rebels can't ever seem to catch a break? The Empire just keeps getting 2 VPs until the win while everyone else turtles around the board? There are over 500 variant articles on this game! What else does that say other than people are desperate to make this POS playable, and it ain't. Playing this game is like getting intestinal polyps removed without anesthesia. Ugh. Go play Eclipse.

I was sorely disappointed by TI3.  I expected a fantastic epic game, but found a game that was completely bogged down by a plethora of re-hashed euro mechanics.  I was particularly disappointed by the fact that this is one of those games that allows conflict and fighting, but discourages it significantly by making it too difficult and unrewarding, so people end up sitting around, building up in their own corner of the map, waiting for others to fight.  That kind of wargame is a big pet peeve of mine, so this isn't my cup of tea, although I'd probably be willing to give it a second chance.

It's epic. It's also exhausting. It needs quite a bit of preparation and will easily consume what feels like a whole day. It can pay off, and it's tremendously fun if it does. The first half is almost always engaing. But as the game enters the final stretch, you may come to feel hopeless which might make you attack someone, just so that finally a big space fight will happen, which might throw of the other players because it's unnecessary. Richly thematic and great components. I love the idea but I dread the let down that it can be which makes me very hesitant to suggest it.

Overwhelming at first for a lot of new players probably, but man this game has everything. Diplomacy, trading, civ building, discovery, and of course, lots of space conquest. If you can find the players (even 3 works ok, though it makes the already lackluster trade feature even more lackluster) who are willing to spend the time, it can be fun. However, the frist two players to start attacking each other will usually lose which seems to be a pretty serious issue.

(1 incomplete play) No rating because it was incomplete. If I were to rate it, it would probably be a 6. My main complaint is that it feels like there's a lot of potential imbalances -- nearby planet quality to start with, and the effects of laws and action cards moving on from that -- which are hard to rectify even diplomatically (and I'm a fan of Diplomacy). This feels problematic in a game of this length; I would be worried about getting screwed in a bad position for 4 hours of fighting from behind; no fun. But I'll sit down again *with players who have read the rules beforehand* with enough time, to try it again, if someone pushes it.

RATING: 7
Holy smokes, what a Behemoth!  My rating is based off of an initial play with 8 players, including the Shatered Nations expansion.

Now, don't get me wrong, I understand that a game of this depth and size can't be digested in a single play through.  The game is megalithic though, and new players should be prepared for a long haul, particularly if there are a lot of participants.

There is light at the end of the tunnel though, and I think I would play TI3 again... with the right crowd.  There is a lot cool material here, and I would like to dig into it more.

One thing I will mention that I have seen in other reviews... the victory points are difficult to come by, and the path to winning is odd.  Your secret objective will get you 20% of the way there or so, but after that you're left to the wim of the cards.  This Machiavelian path to victory does fit the theme though, so perhaps it is part of the overall experience.

Super Meaty, but fun.

RATING: 5
[thing=12493][/thing] is a monster of a game in many ways: it is big (350+ miniatures, 400+ cards), sprawling, long, complex (but not all that much), and it has many, many moving parts.

TI3 shares the role selection mechanic that is used in games like [thing=3076][/thing] and [thing=28143][/thing], in which you choose a role, that will give you a major action and the others can "follow" the same role, but doing some minor action. To follow a role you spend Strategy tokens. There are 8 roles in the game: Initiative, Diplomacy, Politics, Logistics, Trade, Warfare, Technology, Imperial.

Every round, the players will choose a role to do, and the choosing order will go from the player that took Initiative in the last round (and the player can't choose Initiative two times in a row). The players choose a role in clockwise order, beginning with the one that took the Initiative role last round. But after this, the order of play will follow the order of the numbers on the roles. The players can activate the role anytime during his turn, and once he does it, the major action will happen, then every other player will be able to do the minor action of the role by paying one Strategy token (and usually will be necessary to spend resources also) - the Initiative role doesn't have a major action, it allows, however, to the player that selected it to use all the minor roles without spending Strategy tokens (and, of course, the player will be the first to select a role in the next round).

Also, the players will have a number of Command tokens, and they can be used, each at a time, to activate a hex (system) in the board, and is only possible to activate a hex once for round (the Warfare role allows for the possibility to activate the same hex twice). You activate a hex in order, usually, to build units (ships, ground forces, docks, PSDs) or to move units (then you place the Command token in the hex to where the ships will move).

The game revolves around these things: actions of the roles and actions (activations) made by the Command tokens. Basically the roles serve for: Initiative (be the first to act), Diplomacy (stop someone from attacking you), Politics (bring an event for voting, also to gain Action cards), Logistics (to gain tokens, that you can put in the Command, Strategy and/or Fleet Supply), Trade (gain resources, also allows for trade deals to be made, or to break all of them), Warfare (to activate twice the same system), Technology (to discover new technologies), Imperial (score points).

[thing=12493][/thing] is very rich in options, and not a lonesome game, as everyone pays attention to the others, trying to take advantage of the minor action of the roles, struggling to get the timming of actions right (like waiting to activate rolls when you know some other players won't be able to do the minor action), and, of course, because it is a game of conquest, so it is only a matter of time before the battles start to happen, especially for Mecatol (the capital center of the board), since many objectives - both public and hidden - requires the players to take and hold Mecatol.

So it is a game that puts players face to face, brawling for the same spaces, the same actions, building fleets and technologies in order to attack the planets of others. And also of politics, since you can make deals with the other races, vote for events that will benefit some (or harm others). It is, also, a very long game, with many hour of playing time.

I was enjoying it quite a bit, but, after six hours of game, one event came - the Ancient Artifact - that basically DESTROYED the whole game of one player, the one holding Mecatol. He had put a major force there (12 big ships, a dock, ground forces, a PSD), and, since he was winning, almost everyone vote to approve the event - and it was all in the hand of a die roll: 1-5 and everything in Mecatol would be wiped out; 6-10, and everyone would get 2 techs. The roll stop at 1. Now, the game basically ended for the player that was in Mecatol - he just couldn't build again his forces, specially because another players were next to his home planets, preparing for attack.

I usually don't mind be in the receiving end of a bad event - it comes with the territory when playing thematic games. But this happened around the 6th hour of the game. Six hours to be taken down by an event. The event didn't affected me, but I still was taken aback by it. Sure, we did have to approve it, but what chance have the person, alone in Mecatol, ahead in points? Not even the promise to leave, and later truce among them, brought someone to his side, because, you won't need a truce if the player is trounced and he won't need to leave if all his forces there are obliterated.

So, the event soured the whole game somewhat - since a swing of luck this big can happen in what is a strategy-heavy game.

I could play it again, but I won't ask nor miss it.

Undeniably awesome, but I drop a point just cause it's got a bit more luck dependency than I wish for when I'm going to commit an entire day to play.  But on the upside, the luck issue resolves my main drawback to Game of Thrones - needing 6 equal players.  TI3's luck factor can let player skills range over a larger spread and still have a good game.

RATING: 8.5
A glorious space epic!  I love this richly textured, multi-faceted game.  Great bits in the best AT tradition.  Lots of player interaction.  The downside is, of course, ~10 hour play time.  (I know some folks swear it can be played in 3-4, but I can't help but think it would be at the cost of losing a significant amount of the player interaction that makes the game great.  I suspect that with a group that has played together a few times that the time would tighten up to 7-8 hours.)
  
[b]Update:[/b] with a pre-built board, races assigned in advance, [i]Age of Empires[/i], and a couple other tweaks, we got the time down to [-]6.5[/-] 5 hours with 4 players.

After two long plays I am barely scratching the surface

Played once with 5 and once with 8 - never finished either

Interested in a game with 5 or so who are familiar with the rules to see if this game will shine - there is a hell of a lot there, though, and I think I will enjoy it eventually

I played this after I've already played Runewars, and I can't help but compare this unfavorably. So much in the game seems like unnecessary time filler, compared to the fine management needed in Runewars.

Played six times so far.  All I have to say is "WOW"!!!  TI3 is one great game.  Maybe I only say that because I've won five of six.  One slight problem I see is turtling.  In most games I've won, I've had the smallest number of forces but managed to complete my objectives more quickly then my opponents.  If you're looking for a space based slugfest - look elsewhere, unless you add optional rules. To prevent the turtling issue, we created an optional rule that lets players claim an extra 1 VP per turn for successfully taking over a planet from another player.

Probably the closest to a 10 rated game I've ever played.

Even the two-player variant here on BGG is very fun to play.

Got a 3rd play in and finally finished a game.  Really like the epic feel of the game, but after 5 hours with only 4 players it's really too long of a game to get many plays.
Just finished at 5 player game (10 hours with lunch break) and really annoying that a bumped player mat caused me to lose some allocation tokens and affect the endgame.  Still came in 2nd even though I was the inexperience one and make several early game errors.

RATING: 7
Lots of replayability but I'm not sure the game is worth the length of play time. The bits are really cool, but the games I've played make me wonder if it really works.  It's kind of too RISK-like in that everybody is afraid to make the first attack and get eaten up (turtleing). I'm also not a big fan of games in which you have to study the card deck to know hierarchy and prerequisites. I'll play if invited, but will not likely suggest it.

Just as with Doom: The Boardgame this game  has a threshold before you realize how it should be played. I haven't crossed that threshold yet. Fun game, not a wargame. Should probably be played  with Shattered Empires.

I lowered my rating of this game because I really think the duration of play is a design flaw.

If the game's playtime were halved by introducing smooth and smart rules and mechanics then I would get a 9.5!

RATING: 8
Großartiges Spiel, aber es dauert viel, viel, viel zu lang.
Positiv ist das man dem Spiel die Länge absolut nicht anmerkt, negativ ist, dass man nach neun Stunden spielen einfach müde, unkonzentriert und lustlos wird. Idealderweise über zwei Tage spielen.
Schön ist, das man jederzeit Siegchancen hat, selbst wenn man das gesamte Spiel über hinten liegt.
Schlecht ist dass man ständig viele Dinge beachten und im Kopf haben muss, was nach einigen Stunden gar nicht mehr so einfach ist.

Simply fascinating game of epic space combat.  Somehow, this game takes the most complex, unwieldy subject matter imaginable and turns into a downright elegant game experience

Petersen has taken all the best elements of modern "euro" mechanics and put them where they belong - a sprawling monster in which asses are kicked rather than kissed

Just noticed that there was little middle ground in my ratings profile, so I'm redressing the balance with games to which I am rather indifferent.  OK, but not rushing to play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Third time's the charm in terms of layering enough Euro-style mechanisms on top of an originally too simplistic, too diplomatic conquest game to make a game that is more interesting, more structured, and less of a diplomatic free-for-all rife with tit-for-that, manipulate the newbie, and kingmaking.

The cost, however, is an absurdly too long and complex game for what it is.  If you're fine with its length and still present diplomatic aspects, then this is an ok game and probably better than Eclipse.  Faint praise, I know...

For me, however, this is an ungainly beast.  I'd rather play Diplomacy for a diplomatic game or my own Throneworld for a pure conquest game.

Fantastic Game- blend loads of different styles into a almost entirely cohesive whole. Great fun, great flavour, great mechanics, simply great! Flaws? One or two, but massively outweighed by what is right. Play it, then play it again, and don't let the length put you off. Well worth the cost and the effort to get lots of geeks together!

The grand-daddy of all "epic" space-opera games, this one truly has it all and was the foundation upon which Christian Petersen built the rest of the FFG approach to board game publishing. Excellent rules, reasonable rulebook, quality components and lots of options with the expansions. The only true downside is the time investment to appreciate the epic nature of this experience.

So what if there are A LOT of little rules to remember and you need at least six to seven hours to play with five. So what if it takes quite a long time to explain the rules to newcomers. This game is really exciting. It wonderfully combines proven mechanics to create a fresh, atmospheric game with a truly epic feel. Only nag is that there should have been more objectives that stimulate players to move across the board and fight.

Played only once with 3 players. Very fiddly, yet the theme is sucking me in. The units are varied, but I feel like players tend to collect massive armies and then push when the victory points are closed. Otherwise, the buildup is counter-productive to game play. Still, the theme.....

I played this at Origins 05.  This game seems to deliver what it promises.  It is a large, reasonably complex space epic that doesn't leave anything out.  It was actually much less complex than I had feared, and the basics are covered on the player mats and the strategy cards.

RATING: 7
A military unit strategy game, it is a superior version of Runewars.  However, this game is intimidatingly long; it can run over 10 hours with a full table.  The game is very satisfying to play and do well, but if a few people decide you have to die there is little you can do to protect yourself.  A lack of bonuses on defense mean that offense is the only option which does limit tactical opportunities.  While certainly a memorable experience, the enjoyment from it will depend heavily upon how well you can play table politics.

RATING: 8.1
The old massive all-nighters are almost gone. This dinosaur still roars strong though. A brilliant game for people able to dedicate a day to grueling space opera. One shouldn't play this with less than five people and one should bring enough food and drink to sustain at least ten hours of gameplay. Make that fifteen if you have the extensions. old-school epic for anyone from the 80's. Kids shouldn't try this at home.

I'll never realistically have the time, friends, or money to play this, but I occasionally have the urge to throw myself into a piece of media that is just really expansive, and this sounds like something I would enjoy along those lines.

Rating includes using Shattered Empire strategy cards.  Using the cards that come in the box, the game is unplayable.  If you just get the main box, print out the strategy cards from Shattered Empire and use those instead.

This is my all-time favorite game.  Absolute favorite, without hesitation.  I would play this game every weekend if I could get the interest in it.

Rating after one game - Good Ameri-trash sweetness. I love the build up and technology tree that is inherent with the game. It readily pulls a theme from such sci-fi classics as Asimov's Foundation. Initial layout can slant the tables to one player or another so make sure players realize the resource importance.

A 4E space game with the mechanics turned up to 11!. I kind of enjoyed my first play of it, but really it was the people I was playing with, more than the game itself so I might as well have been playing Risk. Too much to keep track of, too many decks of cards and interactions with special powers and planets etc, etc. Nice bits but careful planning and subtle maneuvering can be destroyed with a couple of die rolls. Too much game and not enough play for my liking. Much prefer Nexus Ops.

I enjoy the Imperial 1 card, and also the Bureaucracy, Tech 1, Trade 2, and all in all the Shattered Empire Strategy card. I can't get a hold of the box, so right now we just play with substitutes.

This game is also known as "The new and improved Impact" in my gaming group.

Twilight Imperium is a sprawling and lengthy slugfest, with amazing exploration, space fleet, combat, and political maneuvering. Unique, powerful alien races make every game it's own challenge, but be prepared to spend an hour re-reading the rules before you play, and then a whole day spent on one massive session.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
My favorite game. Perfect space opera. And although some house rules are needed imo (we play with a system that gives fog of war on exploration)

Its a love or hate game, that really divides the waters, as playtime easily can reach 12 hours.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.9
This is by far the most epic and well-themed game in my collection. It can be difficult to arrange full sessions of it, but it's worth it every time. Games usually clock in at 6 hours once every player knows what he's doing, but I find myself so invested that it never FEELS like it took six hours. Like Arkham Horror, Cosmic Encounter, and Netrunner (as is probably the case with most Fantasy Flight Games), every single card and character has it's own clever flavor text (and I highly recommend reading the flavor text at the beginning of the rulebook to new players, or having them read it). This would probably be my favorite game if I got to play it more often. Ameritrash at it's very best.   

Shattered Empire is a must! 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Preliminary rating after one play.

I don't mind games with long playing time but there should some excitement be involved with the game. In TI, action is almost non-existent, so we spent the exorbitant playing time (about 8 hours) doing basically nothing except for some building and choosing some cards.

The pieces on the board do not reflect the game situation, in fact, they are quite irrelevant. After six tedious hours, there was the first real attack in our game - did we care at this point? Not really, no.

Even people that like TI admit the game boils down to "turtling" and basically just sitting around. Is this indeed an exciting gaming experience?

TI is supposed to be a civilization game, not a wargame. But most of the things that you do are related to war (space ships, action cards, occupation of territory [= planets], technology advancements etc.). In the end, you never use your military power. So what? What's the point?
 
Game flow is just tedious, after some time, I completely lost interest in following the actions of the other players - it almost never involved me anyway.

As for game mechanics, the trade and political part seems grafted with very little actual relevance to the game.

In the end, this game is a real disappointment. Boredom rules on the board, IMHO the many fine components that come with the game promise more excitement than there actually is.

My rating is a 2, but just because the production value of this game is truly great.

I owned TI3 and both expansions for a year and half before I found a chance to play it with other people.

I read anything and everything I could about TI3, strategies, and options all across the internet but nothing I read, watched, or listened to mentioned what I experienced after playing it for the first time which happened to be a 6 player game:

Twilight Imperium 3 has the most elegant mechanics in a board game that I have ever experienced. Everything from choosing strategy to tactical movement and combat to political decisions to negotiations and treaties is poetry in motion.

That first game lasted 7 hours with 6 people and I was engaged every minute of it. In fact when it ended I thought about what had happened throughout the game through the next day and wanted to play it again immediately.

You will hear how long TI3 is, how many components come it, how "complicated" it is... I suggest you throw all those opinions out, play it, and judge for yourself.

One game of TI3 is more satisfying than 10 other games played on a game night for me. 

Incredible game. If you're ever in the DC area drop me a line and we can watch the galaxy burn together.

Maybe I'm giving a low score unjustly due to the high expectations I had to the game from a lot of respected reviewers who claimed that the only issue the game has is it's play time length. It was not so. Time is not an issue for me when the game is exciting. But declaring war and having battles is very bad business, even if you get by chance an objective that requires that of you. Although we are aggressive players ...The first battle was only in mid game and after a few bad dice rolls my fleet that I build during 4 turns was wiped out while the other guy lost a fighter. My tech was better...just unlucky I guess.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After 2 games impression:
Veeeeeeeery long (5-10hours + setup) and yet it still seems you barely do anything before the game is over. Getting into attacking position takes too long unless you get lucky action cards or have been able to grow good techs by being left alone. In fact the way to win is to look like a non-threat that your neighbours ignore and grow big before you start doing any VP scoring and drawing attention. A lot of luck involved but this is in fact for the better. Theme and the fact that everyone has to play with unique play styles lift this one up higher.
The biggest downside is that the races are not balanced, everyone can win but some feel far better than others.

To sum it all up: One of the most interesting game experiences I've had, but too many things that outright annoy me and prevent a top rating. If you're not into the theme and/or loooong games don't even try this one, it might make you hate boardgames.
Update: After having played a lot more boardgames I can only reach one verdict... unplayable piece of ****.

Its sad for me that I don't like this game more.  I am not a fan of house rules and often lose interest in games that need to be 'fixed'   Whilst I think this game is fun and I will gladly play it, it's very long for a game that is usually decided by whom takes the Imperial strategy more than anyone else.   I hoped for more like 2nd edition but quicker, instead I got 2nd edition but longer and less interesting.

No part of it seems disjointed, and it comes with tons of variants (as well as tons more in the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/22821/twilight-imperium-3rd-edition-shattered-empire]two[/url] [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/95802/twilight-imperium-third-edition-shards-of-the-throne]expansions[/url]) to customize it to your group's taste.

2008-05-17 - Now played the 2p variant and it was amazing! Bumping rating up from 6->7.5. The 2p game finished in 3 hours including setup. I would definitely play this again. Also played a 4p game between these ratings and I liked it. There are a _lot_ of things going on and it is so very delightful.

This game has several flaws: a player can lose any hope of victory quite early (disappointing in such a long game), encourage turtling, unblanced special powers, unbalanced roles to select, very long.
Sort of wargame with some "euro" mechanics thrown in resulting in a tedious mess.

Epic game. It takes a lot time to play it but it's worth it. Building up your civilization through colonization, fighting, discovering and negotiaiting feels great. I love the level of player interaction here - there are constant discussions and negotiaitions, not a dull moment to be seen, even thought the game is quite slow. One of my favourites, as I think this is what gaming is all about - adventure, sanse of discovery, interaction with other people. Love it.

The game mechanics seem to promote too passive play. Our games tend to be long, uneventful and boring. Everyone just builds up their forces and then it's over. By the time any combat might happen, someone reveals a secret objective and wins.

I've played it with 6 people, and the whole experience felt very bloated. Too many minis to deal with, too much auctioning for cards, and too little combat. It's almost not to your advantage to fight other players, and I just can't get too into the political intrigue. Really you're just fighting other players over minute resources and it's not all that interesting.

Theme is cool with lots of species and the war suns / death stars star wars stuff is nice.
the modular map is nice
The rest (system, turns, cards...) i found it boring and preventing any level of immersion.
the boards, tokens, cards... are cumbersome to set up and do not add to the feel of the game.
it is a game for hard core strategy player who just like to shine as the clevest player by managing the multiple layers of complex cogs of the game... not something i look into for games

An excellent epic game that nicely combines mechanics for warfare, economics and diplomacy. I really like the aim of the game being to score victory points through completion of objectives irrespective of how well you do in any of the above three measurements of power. The strategy cards mechanic is an excellent idea giving players various options and keeping gameplay variable. The game is a long one to play, but with preparation and the right players is a real journey.

RATING: 6
Has some issues - its a virtual elimination game, some cards are very powerful others mostly worthless, too long in the fact that some players know they aren't going to win half way through, one big battle can determine the game - unfortunatly there aren't enough die rolls to even out the bell curve in one game - so the lucky player can often win the game. Some starting player powers are much, much better than others. Bits do look very good though and the voting aspect is fun.

This is another one of those mechanically sound, compelling games that just doesn't interest me that much.  I can totally see why its fans like it as much as they do, but I'm not a fan of 4x games, even when the combat isn't a requirement (in our one game, none of us got aggressive until it was necessary, so it was a fairly peaceful game, but it wasn't possible not to fight after the first 2/3 of the game).  It also takes a long time to play, and while I don't mind longer games, this one just doesn't have what it takes for me to feel like it's worth the amount of time it takes to play.

I like this game, but it's /long/ and the endgame feels a bit drawn out and inevitable. Really, it's Risk, with chrome. I haven't played it enough to know whether the chrome actually adds interest to the gameplay, or whether it's just needless complexity.

Second game with 5 played in under 4 hours...this is THE space-game. The political, secret agenda, and different-each-time VP conditions make this so much more than space-conquest. Winning is more likely to involved conquest at just the right time for just the right objective and for only a few turns rather than sweeping attempts to wipe the whole board.

Love the experience of playing TI3 even though I don't really like the game. I tend not to enjoy the overboarding (and in my mind useless) complexity of many FFG games, they are just too fiddly and not streamlined enough for me. The same accounts for TI3 but I enjoy having the full day experience of a space opera 2 or 3 times a year.

RATING: 6
Twilight Imperium is a beauty. Great graphic design, colorful and heavy duty hexes to build the gameboard and a truckload of plastic spaceships. It all can sprawl quite a bit during gameplay, but considering the game's scope, that's probably to be expected.

The game itself is an excellent design that provides for important decision making nearly every turn. The large variety of alien races and their asymmetrical racial powers make every game play out differently and the political phases can be a blast, with much bribing and backstabbing. Another nice feature is the truckload of official variants and optional rules included, which can be added or subtracted almost at will without changing the flow of the game. On the downside, the game occasionally will end before there have been any meaningful confrontations between players. (This was addressed, quite successfully, in the Shattered Empires expansion.) Also, combat resolution is a little uninspired, but it gets the job done.

While the game itself is fantastic, it doesn't hit the table nearly as much as I would like. It is simply too hard to experience Twilight Imperium on a regular basis due to its frightfully long playing time. Even with players moving at a brisk pace, it is a five or six hour endeavor, longer with more than four players. A game of Twilight Imperium pretty much excludes anything else when our gaming group gets together. As such, we usually end up playing three or four shorter games instead, which tends to do a better job of keeping everyone interested...Still, it's one of the all-time greats and should be in every gamer's collection.

Update: After almost a decade of newer, leaner games I am having a tough time staying on this band wagon. While I adore the setting and everything it tries to do, it simply no longer holds up. Too much downtime, too many fiddly rules and modifiers...this is a game for someone that only has five games in their collection, as pulling it out once a year makes for seriously tedious gaming. I've also come to realize the time investment to fun ratio is way off. Usually there is only one exciting play per game, which is far too little for a game that takes 6 or 7 hours to play. This one will live on as a fond experience in my earlier days of board gaming, but otherwise I think I am pretty much done with it.

One of my favorite strategy games of all time. The mechanics underlying the whole game are deceptively simple and elegant, yet the game itself is epic and grand in scale. The only down side is that it is often difficult to get a large enough group together for a long enough time to finish a whole game. But when you do, it is  truly amazing gaming experience.

As close to perfection as a board game can be. And all this "cheese & whine" about how long it takes to play - well for me it's like complaining that Song of Ice and Fire takes too long to read.

Mind you, the rating I gave reflects the state of game with the Shattered Empire xpac which is widely considered mandatory. The base game would have a tad lower grade.

Unless you can play this game in sessions, it simply takes too long and inevitably wears out its welcome. The 4 hours stated on the box are a joke, I've never had a game take less than 8. The most recent game was over 14 (6 players, 3 of them new). In my experience, games generally end because everyone is too exhausted to go on and a winner is declared just to bring an end to it.

Significant house rules are needed to make the game faster. But even then, with both expansions this game has far too many moving parts, which need to be pruned out.

I love this game, the theme is fantastic, the politics and interaction is superb. The downside is it takes so long to play and needs five or six people. The best game we played so far was five people using one of the asymmetric scenarios from Shattered Ascension (see www.ti3wiki.org). It was a day of pure indulgence and pleasure!

To be honest I can't decide whether this or Race for the Galaxy is my favourite game.

It's bloated and has a lot of flaws, but it also has a lot of cool stuff.  The ISC as written is dumb, but there are good alternatives after all this time, so no fuss there.  HATE the tech cards...why not a single chart and markers?  Use the (presumably expensive) cards for other mechanisms where they make sense!

At the end of the day, though, this game is just too long for too little payout. The scale is all off, ending up feeling more like warring frog tribes in a small swamp. Where is the vastness of space? Why is combat such a freaking boring luckfest? Why was no effort given to address the "let's you and him fight" problems? Why are the planets so dull? Why was the political aspect toned down from 2nd edition?

RATING: 7
 Only 1 play (with some number of expansions) and I got utterly destroyed (1 victory point).  The game gives you so much to do, however, that earning only one victory point in four hours was extremely fun!  

The political and economic aspects are clever.  And the Puerto Rico-like roles do a good job of both enabling/constraining actions and keeping the game interesting for those that are more removed for the action (free stuff, woo!).

My only concern was that there was relatively little military action (except for one huge showdown) for a game of such length.  On the one hand, this emphasizes that the game is not strictly a war game, with economy and politics being equally important.  But on the other hand, it also seems like it really encourages turtling, which can drag things out.

Anyway, after one play, I am enthusiastically looking forward to another game, for opportunities to try out new races and new strategies.

"Third times a charm."  Clean rules set, minimal book keeping.  Great 4X game.  I've been waiting for this one to get overhauled for a while, and it looks like they've done it right.  Note that for what it is, I still rate it a 10 but it's an epic monster with everthing plus the space shuttle sink thrown in.  Lots of politics and more.  Since Eclipse has come out, I put this one below Eclipse on my list for ease of play and accessibilty.

Disappointing.  I had been looking forward to this game, hoping for a clean version that was fun, and basically MOO in space.  

What I got was a LONG, drawn out affair that dragged on.  I have no problem with long games, I enjoy Empires in Arms, Diplomacy, Europe Engulfed, etc.  This just left me cold.  I was lookng forward to my actions, not because I was dying to do something on the board, but because I wanted to do something other than rearrange my spaceships.  

There was little incentive for combat for several reasons (6 player game).  First, everyone was close enough to grab 5 planets for that objective.  Second, the special objective was too difficult for me to achieve (4 planets with the same tech advantage) so I had to write that off.  Upon reviewing others special objectives, they either dealt with some aspect of Mecatrol Rex, or taking some spread of tech systems.  Unfortunately, they were all worth the same 2 VPs, even though some were obviously more difficult than others.  Third, since everyone starts at relative parity to each other, their was very little incentive to attack as the forces were so even.  This is exacerbated by the fleet supply tokens as you are forced to load up on those to gain a massive advantage to win battles.  Fourth, PDS systems seem WAY too powerful, as they can wreak havoc on an invading force and make attacking systems prohibitively expensive (combined with the fleet supply limits, this effectively halts extended campaigns).  

I will give this another try, but several players in my group are beginning to feel the same way about this game after several plays of the game, so I do not feel that my rating will improve.

I played this for the first time recently at WBC at the prodding of a friend. Oddly enough it fits my science fiction-esque imagination well for playing a  multi-player economic & combat space title. I'm not so sure about the victory conditions but there's a great deal of fun to be had playing with 5 (or more with the expansion) opponents just trying to squeeze out victory from the tabletop galaxy the hexagonal tiles form. Good points include the huge number of differences each player's empire can evolve in play and that the game doesn't immediately become imbalanced due to a 'technology' change. The rules aren't overbearing, though certainly not simple as many games can be. The play went smoothly with only a few of the hiccups of a player who wanted to spend more time than necessary analyzing his every possible choice to maximize results. 

My son has also played this game a number of times and it has been enough of a favorite to him for me to pick up a copy (plus the expansion) and get it ready for some family play.

TI3 is a really well done game.  However, I'd rate it higher (maybe a 9 or 10) if it was about 25% shorter.  We played a 6 player game today, admittedly with 6 newbies, and the game took (after explanation) about 7 hours.  Assuming we could cut it to 5 hours if we played again, it is still about 1 to 1.5 hours too long.

We played with the 1 point ISC/open objective card variant.  I think that the 2 point ISC card would be a lot stuffier and also more random.  I think the variant is the way to play this one.

Better yet, play with the expanision!  TI3 is much better with the expansion than without it.

Also, limit your players to 4.  More players doesn't add anything except time to the game.  4 is perfect - all the roles get selected, and the board is balanced.

At the time I bought this it was the biggest boardgame I owned. We have played it three or four times since then and I have always just had a hoot. I love the fluff and setting and the rules are great too. This was the first game we played that made heavy use of the Euro-based card rules and the built in timer. 

I have given this game an 8 because it has some flaws. The expansion Shattered Empire brings it up to a 10 for me.

Addendum:  Shattered Empire makes the game A LOT better.

Oh my god.  This is an awesome game.  If you like empire building games this is a must.  Just make sure you have the required 8-10 hours for your first game.

As we played the turns did get quicker as less rules checks were needed.  But I can't see how you would get below 6 hours for a 6 player game.  Also make sure you have a big table.

By the end of my first game (9 1/2 hours) myself and all 5 other players were already planning when to play the next game.  Buy this game, you wont get to play it often but when you do, each game will be memorable.

This gets a 6 only because any game that takes 5 hours to finish is really hard for me. I don't normally play these kind of games and I have to admit that I wouldn't be opposed to getting "dragged" into another game so long as people don't mind me pacing and doing other things during the game.

RATING: 7.6
"An epic game". It has a very long game time and has lots of components, ships and battles. The base game is a bit dry and repetitive though. Next time I play it I want to have a free day ahead of me and the expansion to complement the game.

RATING: 8
With my group of player, we play a game under 1 hours/player (and we almost use all component of the expansions). This is like a big party game, we threaten each others, we backstab, we trashtalk each others, we make ugly faces, we laugh (yeah... we drink maybe too much during the game). We take it light hearted because there is quite a chunk of random with the dice rolling and objectives draw, but it doesnt remove that for the rest, it is all about strategy and opponents crushing under spaceship's pew-pew-pew.

Great Game, in all respects: king size box, loads of stuff, fabulous rules which keep you on the edge all the time, challenging both tactically and strategically, and very nice artwork. The best SF game I know. And as an added bonus: it takes 5 hours to play! Never regretted a second of it.

RATING: 7.5
Long game, will have to try it where everyone gets 3 free tech advances from the start.  Otherwise the tech tree is just too hard to get advances, and to win you just take Imperial strategy ... and if that's all you do ... why play it in the first place.

RATING: 10
This is an amazing game. Great for many players it is still a fun maker for even a few. The artwork is well done and has tons of plastic minis. The politics cards make it a heavy interactive game and the system, eventhough in the beginning might be hard to learn, is flawless with the knowledge of the rules. Perfect for those sundays when you have plenty of time to fight for the ruling of the known universe.

This is the "big one" at the moment, right now holding IMHO a place similar to that which Advanced Civilization and Diplomacy have held in gaming history. To me, a serious gamer isn't one who plays cutesy games like Munchkin or Killer Bunnies, nor is he/she one who plays Euro stuff like Puerto Rico. I'm a much more forgiving person as far as games are concerned, so I'll say that those games do indeed have a place: they're shorter and lighter, and sometimes that's what's called for. But if you have an afternoon that you want to dedicate to something epic, then this is what you choose. The Third Edition components are incredible, the game play deep and involved, the options almost too much to handle. Unlike some games, there is no "down time" while you wait for someone else to hurry the heck up; you have to be paying attention all the time. Now, many complain about the Imperial Strategy Card, or ISC. Whatever. It's necessary to move the game along, and there are a variety of optional "texts" for it, so that if it REALLY bothers you, you can change the rules a little and still play. There is no excuse in fact for not playing. Which brings me to another complaint people seem to have with it: that it's too long. Prohibitively long. Well it IS long, but I've sat through tedious games of Princes of Florence and Runebound which were themselves overlong and seemed to be even longer because the games are kind of boring, whereas a four-hour game of TI3 seems to go by very quickly. And I'd rather play one game of TI3, win or lose, than four games of Puerto Rico or - God forbid - Citadels.

One of my favorite board games.  I love this damn game.  I love the theme, the way it plays, everything.  The time factor is a bit rough and games with more than 4 people tend to really drag while waiting for everyone to take their turn but still, given a game night, I'd pull this out almost every time!

RATING: 7.5
Rating is for TI with the Shattered Empire expansion. Knock off a point or point and a half for just the base game, as it has some issues with turtling and the Imperial strategy card.

But, with Shattered Empire, you have a new set of strat cards that don't include the imperial, the objectives tend to be much more aggressive in nature, artifacts add additional conflict to get another VP, advanced fighters have been reigned in, and the game just works a lot better. Then it is [b]the[/b] epic 4x game.

Amazing epic game/experience that has it all: deep space struggle for domination, politics, trade, science, exploration, combat. 

It has its flaws (imperial strategy is so strong that you have to take it every time you get an option, forcing you in turn to take initiative as soon as it is available), but the main price for this awesome experience is time ... you need a lot of time to play this mega game.

But if time is not an issue for you then you own it to the galactic emperor inside of you to try it out.

This game just tickles me.  Almost every famous popculture SF moment is represented here in one way or another.  Plays very long, but I always find myself wishing for more space (literally), and more turns.  Is it a good gaming system?  No.  Is it a tight game?  Hell no.  But as a gaming experience, it is unparalleled.

This is a space empire building game.  You need to be aware of the Imperial Strategy, and you probably need to fix it to your taste.  There are some strategic choices to make, and there is a lot going on on the board as well.  It is a long game, but that is the nature of an epic empire game.  It sounds like if you play it a lot, flaws emerge.  It wasn't engaging enough, given the time it takes, for me to keep owning it.

10/25/08-6 player 4 ring long map with DS counters 2nd SC set - What a game - the only thing that keeps this from a 10 is the length - i suspect my next few plays will raise this as the group I play with becomes more and more experienced

I have mixed feelings on this one.  The theme is fun and I really enjoy playing this.  But (and this is a biggie) it's a member of a series of games (like Age of Renaissance) where the highest profit comes from attacking the weakest and taking them down, but the games balancing mechanism is for player to attack the strongest player who is benefiting for a rich get richer power curve economy inadequately constrained by action and resource limitations.

One of the few gaming purchases I have come to regret. The concept of the game and the design of the mechanics is amazing, but every time I play, everyone ends up hating each other and being miserable by the time we start flipping Phase 2 Objectives. I believe it would be better if I had opponents who were more into wheeling & deeling, but I've yet to come across some. Game loses a full point from me for the existence of Public Execution. I'm all for banging the leader, but, guys, what were you -thinking-? Still willing to play again I have any friends left after the first few games.

Not entirely what I expected: its not a game of empire building and great space battles.

I totally understand why people would love this game. Once you have invested in this game, to understand the mechanism and player interplay, it's a very deep game with a lot of possibilities.
There are probably some limited optimal development paths for each race. But there are likely more than 1, so there are still options to adapt to your neighboring players and how the game develops in general.
Each race does facilitate a unique playstyle, which starters probably won't pick up on ('Humans' being able to stall a turn by 'breeding' for example).

I have one mayor point against this game: It takes such a long time to finish. A lot can be optimized to reduce play time (having individual people managing certain parts of the game, being experience with the game and the race you are playing, play to a lower point ceiling, etc), but even then it's still a long sit down. I already find it hard to find people willing to put down ~4hours to play a game of Arkham Horror, so I can't really seeing me getting this game to the table more than a few times per year! For TI3, that would probably suffer a worse fate :( 
Planning a whole day to gaming, I'd rather have some variety in what I play (There are multiple games I like better than TI3) or would rather do a RPG-day.

One fix I can think of is having the ability to stretch the game out of a couple of days.  But this requires you to make effort to preserve the game state, taking pictures, leaving the board for the next day (if people are sleeping over) or look for a digital playing field like using VASSAL perhaps.

In a shorter timespan, this game would have been around 7 or 8 for me. But in it's current state it's a 6 as I would only accept playing this game when in the right mood due to it's long playtime alone (matching the  rating description).

There are so many exceptions to rules, rules introduced mid game and maybe removed later but maybe not, technology cards with multiple prerequisites that also have prerequisites just to get a small bonus to one type of ship but not all types of ships, and by the way you can only purchase that technology during a round in which the technology strategy was either chosen by you or assigned to you. It's just way too much to keep track of for a new player.  However, there were aspects of it I like, and I suspect it would be better after more plays.

The game needs some serious tweake:
-too long (in eight hours we completed appr. 50-70% of the game with 5 players);
-some objectives are much more difficult than others (why not simply say: player with most planets after x-rounds wins;
-trade portion practically non-exsistent;
-this also counts for the negotiation portion of the game.

This one's a toughie.  Personally, I think it's one of the  most finely crafted games in the history of games.  But it's hard to play well.

Let the Galaxy burn, and this game along with it. My first (and only) play of this game was long, long awaited. I wanted to see why this game was so legendary.

The answer? It's length, and only it's length. There are so few interesting decisions in this game that it sucks the fun out of an 8 hour session. Seriously, I could've made more interesting decisions in a 12 minute game of For Sale:

Tile Placing = 1 interesting decision
Turn Order = 2 interesting decisions
Building = 2 interesting decisions
Attacking = Surprisingly no interesting decisions
Technology = 1 interesting decisions
Voting = interesting, but it never mattered.

Utterly lame game. I'd much rather have played Nexus Ops. 3/10

Rules are hard to remember. Takes forever to play. We gave up our third try because we had 3 new players and it just dragged on. Not much good with only 3 players, needs 4-5 committed players who all have read the rules and are willing to commit a full day to playing. Could be epic but hasn't gotten there for us yet. Ended up selling, not worth the time and effort IMO. Wanted to like this so bad, and still think about it sometimes years later, thinking, should I give it another go? Probably wouldn't turn down a game if offered, but imagine that I would hate being whooped by more experienced players for 6+ hours. Need to look at other 4X games to scratch this itch.

Aftering playing only one game, I was hooked. I've immediatly went out and bought the expansion afterwards. I can't wait until tomorrow, when we get to play this awesome, epic sci-fi game again. TI is a great purchase with lots of strategy and theme that should keep us begging for more for years to come. My play group is loving this game so far, hopefully they want to keep playing this game for quite sometime. Afterall it is a long game to play through.

*Update* 
I changed my score on this one slightly because of the amount of time it takes to play. I'm not able to get it to the table as often as I want because of this. I really need to plan for a day when we cam play this one again soon.

This is the most epic game I have ever seen! It. is. just. EPIC. Takes a lot of time to complete the game (which of course is an advantage), a lot of things to do, and a hell of a lot of strategy in there. I like the optional rules with which you can tweak your game for your taste. Also it's a sci-fi themed game! I love sci-fi! This game on it's own is only a 9 (blame on the Imperial SC) but with all the expansions it's almost an 11!

In my group are two copies and that just the only thing stopping me from buying it. The only downside is the time that it takes to play the game, and that's only  why we play it so little.

Wow!  I can't believe it took me this long to play this game!  There is no doubt that the designer of this one really polished out their intent for it and thought of almost every nuance they could.  Granted, I've still only played this three times, I can see why it is so revered.  The game itself is the perfect marriage of theme and mechanics.  
Mechanically, the distribution of Command Counters on your player board is a wonderful abstracted representation of how to command an entire race.  Do you want to be able to micromanage the movement and productivity of your race? Allocate a CC to your Command Pool.  How about if you want to make sure your people have enough infrastructure to mass up larger armies?  Bump up your Fleet Size with a couple CCs.  How about making sure you're prepared to adapt your long term strategies based on your opponents?  That what your Strategy Allocation is for.
It's an elegant system that, while easy to implement, makes for some difficult choices.  The fact that the turn-to-turn tactical movement/management and long term strategic choices are so well tied together is impressive.
Now, I will admit to only having played a 'real' game twice. And only with 3 and 4 players at that.  We never even completed either game (PEOPLE AREN'T LYING WHEN THEY SAY THIS GAME TAKES 6 HOURS MIN!!!!!  SERIOUSLY!  BLOCK AN ENTIRE DAY OFF FOR IT!!!).  But my partner and I played (and finished) an unofficial 2-player variant (http://www.preeminent.org/steve/games/ti3/ti3demo/2-player/home/index.shtml) and it was abundantly clear how well designed TI3 actually is.  Even when adapting the rules that are so obviously intended for much larger asymmetric player counts, TI3 still felt like we had to think ahead and make important short and long term decisions.  We only had to house-rule one or two things in a 5 hour game.  And those we're never difficult, since it was easy to see how the original game designers intended those rules.
To me, that flexibility was exactly what makes this game amazing.  Yes, the rule book seems daunting.  And yes, you may initially be confused as to how something as seemingly simple as ship movement works.  But, once you've seen it play out once or twice, it becomes quite clear, and you will see how versatile those mechanics make the game.  The way you can use their restrictiveness against an opponent.  The way you can exploit a bad situation to your benefit.  
This brings me to my only two criticisms of the game (all "0.1" of them).  First, as eluded to in the previous paragraph, you really need to SEE the game played (at least once or two tactical turns).  The rules are actually well written, and maybe some people will instantly know what a tactical action would look like.  However, it wasn't till two of my TI3-virgin friends had seen our experienced friend play one or two rounds that that they really got the mechanics.  And, when you're playing a LONG game like this, one or two rounds is one or two hours!  That means that, for our first (never completed) game of TI3, we were flying blind for the first 2 hours (of 4).  And, given I had already spent about 1.5 hours explaining the rules, that's a LONG LONG TIME to convince someone that a game's system is worth learning.
I, myself, had watched a number of online tutorials which had additionally prepared me for the games concepts.  I would say that TI3 almost requires that kind of preliminary exposure to make it accessible.  With out it, I can see many people, who would otherwise enjoy it, being turned off.  That's a sad (but true) fact that diminishes my final rating of TI3.  
Combined with the oft-stated inability to organize even one gameplay session in a year (due to it's long play time), and you have a game that is worthy of a prefect 10 but won't ever have the frequency of play that warrants it.
But, enough of it's (small) detracting factors.  I would be remiss if I didn't laud over the games theme!  WOW!  What a fantastic job they've done here!  
At first (first glance at the box in the store) I was quick to dismiss this game.  I mean, it has a tiger person on the cover!  How cheesy can you get!  Sure the art was good, but it's a TIGER PERSON!  It was hard not to think [TI3] was some cobbled together Star Wars fan-fic, all wrapped up in an overly convoluted game system, whose only fame comes from the loud voices of teenage boys playing in their parents basement.
However, to my surprise, the game is plastered with rich theme - to the point that it is hard to think this is actually a game that came AFTER movies/books like Star Wars and Dune.  Normally, I'm not a huge fan of the 'Space Opera', but this game really embodies the nuance of the genre.  It takes all the romantic archetypes of hysterical civilizations (the ancient Romans or Persians) and all the symbolic people of mythologies (like Sirens), abstracts them into fantastic game mechanics, and writes page upon page of background that is both fresh and recognizable.  I found myself reading every race sheet's background and envisioning real people, struggling in real ways to achieve supremacy.
It's a real testament to how well a game is designed when, after reading a fictional history of a character, you can easily remember how that character works mechanically in the game.  Those themes are so well thought out, you really do want to play out your race as they were intended.
And that's before you even get to all the (completely optional and unobtrusive) flavor text that litters the planet, political, action and objective cards!  I found myself actually reading the flavor text of a proposed law out loud while playing.  It just felt like exactly what I needed to do to muster up the votes to pass or veto the motion.
And that's TI3's charm:  You come away from the game really loving how you shaped your race.  Really caring about who was "elected minister of internal security".  Really regretting the loss of the planet "Quan'Qua Kki Xito BLAH" (making fun of the names there), whose indigenous peoples were saved by your intellectual Universities of Jol-Nar only to be ousted by the violent Sardakk N'orr.  It's the epic (yes, this is one of the few appropriate uses of the word 'epic') story that a game weaves that makes this game wonderful.
TI3, I LOVE YOU!

RATING: 4.6
CRIPES, this has plenty of exceptions.  I think the game components could use some better naming and identification marks to show to what they correlate.  I do like, however, that there are really disparate ways to approach victory, so you can attempt whatever angle seems appropriate for your situation.  This game offers some good options, with a lot of downtime; the game's pleasure-to-length ratio is way too low for my tastes.  Our first game (2 newbs & the owner of the game) took 6 hours with 3 players.  Yecch.  I was pleased to win sneakily, but could have played several games in that amount of time.  The second game, with everyone knowing how to play, took 5 hours.

The tech tree in the game is pretty silly for a 3- or 4-player game to 10 points; however, I imagine that in a 6-player and/or 14-point game, you can flex all the game's features.  ...but I wouldn't want to.  I spent probably 80% of those 5 hours of the second game actually watching a television show marathon, rather than engaged in the game.  Incidentally, I tied for the win on the second game.

I'm just stunned from this game. What possibilities and what a game.. This touches just the right spots in my gamer brains.

After adding the Shattered Empire expansion to gameplay, this behemoth tightens it's grip as a number one space opera there is. You can spend the better part of the day scheming and plotting in the galactic council trying to get hold of the emperor's throne. Shards of the Throne adds many more good options for this game.

This is still one of my favourite games as of summer of 2014.

A good gamer's game.  Make sure you have plenty of time to play.  It can go on for quite a while if people take a long time with their turns.  The game is slightly flawed in the balance of scoring (see the Imperial card).  The game is a lot of fun, but from what I hear the rules are intensely complicated to get through.  I had the luxury of being taught by those who already played the game.

2012 edit:  I bumped it down to a 6 because I played Eclipse yesterday.  Eclipse is like TI, just cleaner and way better.

Nice presentation and an interesting set of compromises but, ultimately, the theme feels detached. What narrative that does emerge rests on the players' imagination alone, with little meaningful contribution from the gameplay itself.

The definitive space and 4X experience, better than any civ game out there (with honorable exception of Through the Ages). Not so heavy as they say, only quite saturated. Mechanically it is definitely a blend of sort, nothing particularly unique, but clever - not much downtime even though the board can get busy. Action cards make it more of an experience than 100% strategy rewarding game. When combined with race that uses them efficiently action cards can turn the game into something I almost dislike. Beside that, no other flaws in my opinion. Considering time, you simply cannot have it that epic without time investment - same as in TTA. You can make great games like Exodus Proxima Centauri or Nations, mechanically much more flawless than TI3 and TTA... and somehow you wouldn't come even close to their greatness and epic feel. I leave to someone else to find out why is that so.

Very interesting design notes - wonderful insight into some aspects of modern gaming by one the most powerful persons in the business.

Among other inspirations, Asimov's Foundation is probably the most relevant.

Being a hardcore wargamer, this was not what I would call a complex or heavy game. The mechanics are overall good and interesting. The game builds up nicely and even if you get annihilated in space, it is relatively easy to bounce back. What I did find clunky were the victory conditions with, in the expansion, the possibility to shoot far ahead if you manage to use a certain card allowing you to get multiple victory conditions at once. In addition, there is also a tendency where you simply build up the hugest fleet possible and using a bucket of dice approach clobber any enemy near the center of the board. Certainly a better game with 5 or 6 players.

I have now played this game several times since purchasing it, and am discovering new depths and strategies all the while. I have yet to win, and was in fact totally trounced, scoring only 2 points in the last game. Nevertheless, the game always provides a satisfying playing experience, and I always look forward to playing it again.

Just what you want when it comes to empire building. It is cumbersome upon first look, but once you understand the rules it is EASY to teach, easy to play, and a ton of fun. LONG game, but you can just cut down the VP's needed to win and it will go much faster.

Space combat game with political elements. Players take roles each turn. Components are superb. Very nice little spaceships. Game can take a long time to play. 

EDIT : I recently played this with a bunch of experienced players and houserules. The game became a lot more diplomatic and combat was just one of the factors in the game. 

This is more a game of negotiation then of battle and combat.

My second purchase.

And the one that was most complicated for me to get :-).

Living in Serbia while being a gamer is not easy.

First of all, we are in Europe. Which means that our prices (compared to USA) are quite high. 

Then. We are in Europe, but not in European union. This means that importing (via post/dhl/ups/usps) anything from abroad which costs more than € 20.- is subject to customs of 20% + VAT of 18% + inspection fee of € 9.-. 

Buying board games in Serbia was also not easy (and still is not). We had like 1.5 (one and a half :-)) game stores that were selling games for € MSRP + some extra on top :-(.

Just do your math, this is not pleasant to your valet :-).

Anyhow, as I have a friend who is living in Vienna, and as my job takes me to Vienna on (at that time) monthly basis, it was matter of few emails and one visit to http://www.maelstromgames.co.uk/ and both: Twilight Imperium and Shattered Empires where on the way to my friends address in Vienna.

This was and still is my favorite game of epic proportions! I'm always willing to play it!

This is my new favorite game.  After only one play through we barely scratched the surface of the depth of this game.  With so many different ways to get he points you need to win, multiple races and of course a modular board that changes with every new game the replayability is off the chart.  Might be a little long for some, but in order to appreciated the multiple challenges and variances in outcomes you need that time.  Rules can be challenging to learn at first, but once you get rolling the game flows smoothly and seamlessly.  If you are into epic games but haven't tried this one it needs to be on your list.

1/22/09 -- As is, without modifying the strategy cards, this game is pretty lame.  What's funner than earning 1/5th of the VPs you need to win simply by going first in a turn?  Almost everything.  And the irrelevant political cards/phase seemed like a nostalgic vestige from a previous edition that no longer had a place in this "euroized" update.  Some good ideas, but a poor execution that was only later saved by a $50 expansion.

12/13/05 - After 2 plays, I couldn't figure out if this game was crappy or good.  The revisions that were put into the game from the previous edition dramatically decreased the play time, but I'm not sure if it was for the better or not.  I ultimately sold it for lack of regular opponents, but I think I'll always wonder if that was the right decision.  I'd play it again in a heartbeat if someone else were to bring it to the table.

The internet seems to love this game, and the ideas in this game make it seem really fun, but every time I've played has been boring, not engaging, and just a chore. Too much going on that ultimately ends up resolving itself in random dice rolls. No narrative has really developed in any game I've played. It's not the people I'm playing with either! They really enjoy thematic games and can pull a story out of thin air! They love RPG's, and working together to make a game an experience! But this game doesn't support that, it tells you you're a space virus that gives you a neat little ability, but mostly you play the same as everyone else and you've spent 8 hours pushing ships around on a board. I wish the galactic council was actually the focus of this game! It's the one redeeming factor, and I wish it played a bigger role! Instead it's just another option to let the player in the lead start winning more.

I've said a lot about this game because I *want* it to be good. I *want* it to be Cosmic Encounter with an actual map and real diplomacy and a real story. But it fails at just about everything it does in practice, which is disappointing. Don't at me.

This game has loads going on, but each rule is relatively simple.  TI3 is one of my favorites, but the length of play and the real estate needed to set it up means it doesn't hit the table nearly as much as I'd like on games days.

Rating dropped a little bit for Runewars giving the same feel in an infinitely more playable package and length.

Nice but it did not impressed me so much: it is a very slow game and the interactions between the players could be reduced at the minimum if they are quite far.

Along with Arboretum and Bohnanza, this looks like a masterful little card filler. SU&SD called it "A Celebration of Luck." For this sort of game, I'd say that's high praise.

Bring on the sandstorms! Bring on the roving bands of thieves! Bring on the cruel whims of fate!

RATING: 8
This is a very good game for what it is. it's very simple to learn and doesn't require reading so I have successfully played it with a 6 year old. Once you know how to play you can do so in 30 minutes or less, and can play with up to 5 players. It's also small in size so it's easily portable, even on vacations. It is a fun game and has some interesting strategy. In the end it is a card game a little bit based on luck of the draw, so this doesn't count as a "serious" game. But for the reasons I mention above it is fun to play and we go back to it frequently with both adults and kids.

RATING: 8.5
Saw the reviews and thought, here's a fun looking game that is both small and looks like it can be played at the pub.  So, I searched around and decided on getting the new release rather than an older used copy (the price difference is pretty negligible).  Great game for anywhere from 2-5 people.  The random monuments add a bit of variety to the game.  Great tension as you look at your hand, thinking you're building something great, but do I play now or risk a sand storm going around the circle again?  Simple to learn, easy to get into.  Get this one.  I'm going to hit it at 8.5 for now with room to grow if it hits the table more.

As someone who hasn't checked out the earlier version I find this a blast. The different Monuments shift up the gameplay just enough to maintain replayability, and the actions are easy to learn and really carry the theme forward. The new artwork is also much classier than what I've seen of the game it re implements. Will go right next to Valley of the Kings and Artifacts Inc on my shelf (which pursue a similar theme but with different mechanics).

Cool little card game about set collection, points being scored when playing a set from your hand on your play area after having drawn one card and possibly traded with the market (or in the rare occasion, visited the archaeological site). Quite fast playing, quick to explain and play, and although some sites are better/more thematic that others (you pick one of the six available each game), the game is good, capturing and makes thematic sense.

Initial Impression: For a simple set collection game, this game has some theme to it. Begin a turn by "digging" a card from the draw pile, trade cards in a central market, and sell sets of "artifacts" to a museum. Sounds simple enough. However, there's a push-your-luck element involved as sand-storms can remove half your hand. Toss in a little take-that with some thief cards and you've got an engrossing game with systems that mesh well together. Finally, collecting map pieces to plunder the treasures of the dig site just evokes the Raiders of the Lost Ark theme music in my mind as I play the game. As a filler game, there's really alot to love in this little box. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A good gateway game, very easy to introduce to new people.  The disadvantage is that the optimal choice on a turn is almost always easy to see, and thus I don't find it that interesting.

Archaeology: The New Expedition is an excellent filler that manages to introduce basic board gaming mechanics within the context of a catchy theme (i.e. draw a card is "dig for treasure" etc) making it really easy to teach. I especially love the push your luck aspects with the tent/sandstorm and the end game. The monuments provide a sense of variability while the thieves supply the take-that. It's quick and scales well.

RATING: 6
A simple but solid set-collection game, my other half is a bigger fan than I am which is why the game has lasted in the collection for as long as it has so far. I just much prefer all the other card games of this ilk in my collection - of which there are many, as I love card games. I the pseudo-drafting in the game is less interactive and interesting than other games I have played, reading the other players and their intentions is much easier than many other card games and the decisions you make in the game are less interesting and/or difficult than other games. Furthermore, the game fills an odd niche of being ever so slightly alienating for non-gamers with the numerous different pyramids that dictate set-up etc, but nowhere near as engaging as a deeper card game. So the game very rarely hits the table with family/newer gamers, but also rarely hits the table when I want to play something deeper or more complex with a gaming buddy. However, I will play the game if my missus particularly wants to play it.

Great filler.  New edition with extra monuments adds some additional variety and fun to the base game!  Played with a different monument (the one that lets you dig in a pile of 15 cards to see if you hit 5; sort of like a mini BlackJack; can't remember the name) for first playthrough and the risk/reward aspect was really enjoyable.  Awesome art too.

Archaeology: The New Expedition is a fun light set collection card game with a lot of "push your luck" elements, which some people may not be a fan of, but I think works really well in this game. There are sandstorm and thief cards that make you discard half your cards or allow you to take a card randomly from someone's hand. The amount of these cards in the deck is public knowledge, so you can plan for these negative events accordingly. This game is easy to teach to a variety of different kinds of gamers (or non gamers), so it is a game I am very happy to have in my collection. The only downside I see to this game is the fact that on your turn you only draw one card, which can lead to very uninteresting turns at times. I feel like once you "cash in" and sell items to the museum, it can take several turns before you finally can afford to trade again. Other than that, it's a decent game.

Very simple and quick card game of set collection and disaster mitigation.  Well, more like disaster reaction.   You can easily spend a good portion of the game rebuilding good hands that got destroyed.   But everybody has to do this, and it happens frequently, so it quickly becomes just adapting to the tone of the game.   Nice production and presentation too.   Could work well with non-gamers and families.

RATING: 8
Archaeology is a simple, but fun card game. At its heart - and perhaps this is missed by some - it is a "press your luck" game. How long will you risk holding on to treasure cards before selling them to the museum? In this spirit, we enjoy Archaeology very much. The theme fits too: dig for pieces of treasures, trade them in the marketplace, sell them to the museum.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Set collection with plenty of disasters mixed throughout the deck. Push your luck at its finest. Players will need to evaluate the risk in holding valuable cards in hand vs scoring them early for fewer points. Archaeology the Card Game has always been a favourite, and now with the release of The New Expedition, additional variability in the map cards and support for up to 5 players is a welcome addition to an already fine game.

RATING: 6
This is the new version of Archaeology The Card Game. First of all, this edition looks much better than the old version (ala Lords of Scotland and Fairy Tale). As for the gameplay, it's a set collection and trading game. Though, you're trading with the communal pool of cards, rather than other players. It almost made me feel as if I were play a multiplayer version of Jaipur. That said, I think Jaipur is a much better game than this, despite the games filling different player counts. I think this comes down to the luck of the draw in Archaeology. There is obviously luck of the draw in Jaipur, but you're always taking from the center and have control over how much gets added to the pool. This is risk-vs-reward decision-making. In Archaeology, you draw blind from the deck, and some cards are much better than others. There are also random cards in the deck that screw players over and have targeted attacks.

Overall, this isn't a bad game at all. The game looks good, it's easy to teach, it doesn't take overly long to play, and there is some replay value with the various monuments that are included in this version of the game. That being said, there are other quicker/light games that I would prefer to play.

Archaeology: The New Expedition strikes me as a good gateway game.  There is enough game to it that a ‘gamer’ won’t mind playing it and its simple enough to teach your average newcomer.

Personally, how I feel about the game depends on the monument being played and as card games tend to be, it can end up a bit of a swingy luck-fest whether you get a supreme winning run or a bit of a bum hand; with that said you always have options, there are always decisions to make but that can’t mitigate someone getting a bulk of the maps or high-value items and have greater trading value.

A szabályokat hallgatva nem tudtam elképzelni, hogy ez hogy lesz érdekes. De végül az lett. :) A szabályok tényleg 5 perc alatt elmondhatóak, mégis izgalmas tudott lenni a játék. Alapvetően szettgyűjtés némi csavarral, jó sok interakcióval. Egyértelműen ez a sok interakció adja az izgalmi faktort. De persze mindez azzal is ár, hogy aránylag nagy a kitolási faktor benne, illetve a húzással a szerencse szerep. Ez utóbbira talán jó lett volna kitalálni valami kiegyenlítő mechanikát, mert azért nem nagyon nem mindegy, hogy négyes vagy egyes kártyákat húzol. De 20 percben persze nem fájdalmas a szerencse szerepe.

Simple set collection game with a push-your-luck element that isn't as obtrusively random as I thought it would be since the used catastrophe cards (sandstorms & thieves) are set aside, visible, and list exactly how many exist in the deck.

It's a very basic game of set collection and risk/reward. I felt that my hand was always too empty to do anything fun and most turns were spent by drawing a card, being disappointed by another 1 value and passing my turn over. The economy is a bit weird, the best card per trade-in value is the stone tablet, not the 4 other types of cards that are more rare. The maps can also be OP, but that's at least by design.

I've only played the introduction game with the pyramid and the other dig sites look a lot more fun. I want to try the other sites as well as try fewer players as I think that will improve the game immensely.

Archaeology: The New Expedition is a set collection card game. In a flooded genre, Archaeology stands out. In Archaeology, players aim to collect sets of artifacts. More in a set leads to more points, but the game is filled with push-you-luck elements that make it hazardous to hold on to cards for too long. Sandstorms  Thief Cards, while small additions, propel the game to something much better than its peers. Many set collection games, players keep cards in their hand and hoard until the best possible time to play. In Archaeology, players are pressed to play early. While an early play will score less, it is guaranteed. On top of this, there are special map cards that allow access to a set aside amount of cards. Here is another push-you-luck element. More map cards yield a larger benefit, but it is all wasted if it is taken by another player. Archaeology is tremendously simple, yet decisions are meaningful and satisfying. The artwork is well done and the game scales well. There are many set collection card games, and Archaeology is one of the special ones. Its choices are less arduous than other similar games like Lost Cities and also not as deep, but for what Archaeology sets out to do, it does very well. This is a worthwhile game that deserves attention.

I really enjoy this quick little set-collection card game.  The addition of the variable monuments and the tent card improve this game for me.  It can be a little mean and disheartening sometimes with the cards that rob your hand of cards but obviously planning for it is part of the game.  No reason to own both versions of this in my opinion, this basically replaces/enhances the previous iteration.

Sounds interesting on paper, but I soon realize the flaws after a few games. Very little incentive to hold GOOD card with high value in your hand. Also, the math for point scoring don't seem to be right consider the risk and value of those card...

Not much "Game (Player's decision)" in here especially in higher player count at 4-5, as all you do is draw a card in your turn and you get significant less turn due to everyone share 1 common draw deck. I guess it is fine for a luck of the draw style card game if that is what you're looking for.

Accessibility and portability are primary reasons to own this game. Most people enjoy it, but I never particularly look forward to playing. Others have been "meh" about this one. Short enough to be a good opener/filler.

RATING: 7.5
This is an excellent choice for a gateway game since it is short, portable, relatively easy to explain and offers lots of replayability with the modularity of the monuments. The setup can be convoluted the first few times since there is a strict order in which everything must occur. I wish the box had a better storage option to accomodate this, but that would reduce it's portability

Szerintem nagyon jópofa kis set collection nagyon egyszerű szabályokkal, szép megjelenéssel. Van benne döntési lehetőség bőven, de kétségtelen, hogy a szerencsének is jelentős szerepe van. Tetszik, hogy a 6 különböző műemlékből mindig csak 1 kerül játékba, így azért van, ami változik a játékok során, mondhatni növeli az újrajátszhatóságot. A piac rendszer is rendben van, a homokvihar és a tolvaj lapok miatt folyamatosan ott van az a feszültség, hogy nincsenek a kezemben lévő lapok biztonságban, ezért bizony mérlegelni kell, hogy kisebb nyereséggel, de inkább eladom őket a múzeumnak. Szerintem egészen sok van ebben a játékban, de ha nincs is annyi, amennyit érzek, 20-30 percben akkor is szuper alternatíva.

RATING: 7
Perfect filler game for both gamers and non-gamers alike.  I feel like luck-of-the-draw mostly balances out in this game but can understand some people's objection to that.  Also to the take that element of the sandstorms and thieves well I'm not normally too big a fan of games with those either.  In fact the first time a sandstorm came up my wife declared she hated this game (She has since changed her mind!).  Such that teaching the game requires one addition for some basic strategy.  I'd now tell new players to assume every next draw will be a sandstorm.  That puts you into the right frame of mind to either 1. Keep enough junk '1' cards in your hand such that you can ditch those 2. Play incomplete sets where your hand is too risky instead of waiting for full completion. 3. Knowingly push your luck by waiting longer than you might otherwise. 4. Maximize how long you hold onto the tent which protects you from a single sandstorm per game.  Protecting against the Thief is not much different (i.e. try to hold a few junk cards rather than outright play them as a set.  You'll get too eventually if everything works out at far less cost in points.).  The last 'issue' would probably be with the monument and what and how you earn things there but it also doesn't bother me as I've even traded the map card you need on occasion to complete a valuable set instead.

It does come across as a fairly light game (to me anyway) but one where I find the gameplay enjoyable and different enough that, at least at this point in time, I honestly cannot see this game ever leaving our collection.  It's just fun and quick to play and I do like how the new monuments in this version give you options for varying the gameplay experience even if they too are arguably not all as good.

This game also plays great with 2.

For my 2 cents, regardless of my rating it only a 7 from a how often am I willing to play perspective, I say 'Bravo' to the game designer.  Based upon this version I actually wouldn't change a single thing.

Wow!  So much fun!  This is an updated version of the game that was released a number of years back.  The new artwork is a huge improvement too.  Essentially, you are performing set collections of cards (Egyptian treasures/artifacts) while dodging hazards like thievery (opponent steals a card) or sandstorms (lose half your hand).  Trading cards from your hand in the marketplace (face-up cards in the middle of the table) is an awesome little step in the game to speed up your collection.  Light game, plays quickly, can't go wrong.  Blind buy based on theme and comments here.

This we have played a lot over the last few years. You are set collecting archaeological relics, trying to avoid thieves and sandstorms whilst at the same time collecting maps so you can explore the chambers of the pyramid (and discover new cards into your hand) and deal with a central market.

It is the favourite game of my youngest daughter. She loves drawing the thief and stealing my map or expensive relic card. She loves games where you can get at someone else and you definitely can in this one. It is strange though when I draw the thief and go to chose a card blindly from her hand certain cards have a markedly increased resistence to me taking them, I can see the strain on her face as I try harder to pull the card from her grasp (bad dad I know)! This is the sign that "this is not the card you are looking for" and that I should move along and choose another. Strange how she wins nearly every game!


One extra point I will make as I have to do it everytime we play. The set up requires the shuffling in of the thieves and sandstorms after the pyramid and player cards have been dealt out. An extra step of shuffling which is nothing for most people but if you don't shuffle really well at this point it can spoil the game as those "bad cards" can come out all at once.

Good fun game but it does have a bit of take that with the thieves and the sandstorms, don't even start me off on the sandstorms, they mess everyone up!

UPDATE

So pleased we upgraded to the new version. The artwork is much more pleasing to the eye, the extra artifacts allow for five players and the extra monuments make a great game even better for us. This is going to get a lot of plays as it is still my youngest daughters favourite game.

If you haven't tried it yet and are looking for a light, quick, set collection card game with a little bit of randomness and take that (a very little which for kids makes it more fun) I can completely recommend this game.

One of the best card games in my collection, a great mix of set building and push your luck. Played two player, I like the 'threat' of the sandstorms and the thief cards, and there is no real nasty element to them (the thief card from your hand is chosen at random) which means the game is partner friendly for those who don't like their spouses picking on them). But they force you to think about whether to go for it and try and complete a set, or play it safe and take the points from your incomplete sets while you can. And you are always thinking about whether the cards you trade in the marketplace will end up helping your opponent more than it's worth. The art is wonderful and the cards are of excellent quality. Will never trade or give this one away.

Short, simple, and extraordinary quality considering the overall size of the product.  The market is easily the most enjoyable aspect of the game; second to that would be the push-your-luck mechanic.  There is just enough theme to pull players in, and the variable locations help mix the game up from game to game.  The thieving and sandstorm cards are reminiscent of "Catan" and "Forbidden Desert", but only offer minute player interaction.  Clearly, certain card combinations will give a better return on investment than others, which limits certain gameplay options.

[b]Archaeology: The New Expedition[/b] was sold via auction 10/15/16.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 8)[/COLOR]

[i]I quite enjoyed Archaeology: The New Expedition and really appreciated the few changes they made to game play: adding a variety of monuments to play with and the addition of the tent card which can lessen the pain of sandstorm cards. Archaeology manages to stand on it's own in a very crowded group of set collection games. There is a fair amount of player interaction since there is a common market you are buying cards from and the thief cards. If you want a more chill set collection game I'd recommend Morels (which I think is the better game anyway) but if you are looking for a little edge in your set collection games you can't go wrong with Archaeology. Also a huge plus compared to my other favorite set collection games, Archaeology plays up to four.

*Unfortunately there is one major component issue that really cut down on the number of times we've played. The game comes with two decks of cards that you then shuffle together to play. One deck of cards were cut noticeably smaller than the other making it impossible to riffle shuffle. I contacted Z-Man and they sent me another set of miscut cards so I'm guessing most copies of the game have this problem. It's really frustrating that this problem exists and what's worse is the new printing of Fairy Tale has the same issue. This may seem nit picky at first, but to own a card game that you can't easily shuffle kills my desire to play the game (I hate shuffling cards in stacks and I found cards still clumped together). I may try sleeving my cards and see if that works better.
[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This is an excellent set collection game and will definitely see a lot of play in my house since it will work great in a pub/cafe setting and is great with two. Excellent addition to our card game collection and in my opinion is a major improvement on the original design for the following reasons:

- New artwork is excellent, it blows away the old version.
- Plays up to 5 now.
- Tents: protect you from 1 sandstorm of your choosing, this definitely helps you feel like you have some control over the random nature of these cards.
- 6 monuments instead of 1 which adds a lot of variety when exploring.
- New treasures and some treasures had their point values adjusted (the broken cup has been nerfed a bit).[/i]

Having played this more than when I first commented, I find I have to drop it down to six stars.  Too many times we've had players who draw nothing but $1 cards, which utterly screw their ability to get anything of worth.  It's like a drawn-out version of the early game Catan problem, with the false hope that *this time* you'll luck out.  It's still a neat game mechanically, but I'm in the mood for it less and less now.

Definitely more of a push-your-luck game than a strategy game.

Great artwork but the game is just a bit too random.  In my 5 player game, 2 players drew two map cards each and they got to go through the monument and get the extra treasure cards.  To no surprise, they came in first and second.  When you are only getting 1 card a turn, being able to get 2-3 extra cards is very powerful which makes this game unbalanced and too random.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The obvious problem with this game is that there really is a clean algorithm to follow, and after that you just don't have anything else to think in this game. I personally think the "hole" in the game mechanics is that you can trade infinitely and without any restrictions and that it doesn't cost anything. That makes you almost never worry which set you actually hold in your hand or what is available in the market (because there will always be plenty, given the sand-storms). Just optimize your "victory-points per market-point" (VP/MP) ratio with every deal, and you'll always play an optimal game - there really is nothing left to think. I'd even come close to saying this game's mechanics are a bit broken due to that (maybe that's a slight exaggeration - but at least it makes it less of a game and more of an exercise in following an algorithm).

Good filler but in some games, turns can feel like you're not really making that much progress do to crappy cards coming out. The chambers are nice as they add variety to each game and the cardsrock is great.  I like it, but it doesn't blow my mind anymore. My non-gaming family does enjoy it tremendously so it's good to have around.

I only managed to solo it while I had it borrowed. But with each of the monuments. 

For sure I can say that this version did to the original the same thing that seems to be in vogue with recent remakes of luck pushing games: adding gamey elements and diluting the tension. In a game of set collecting under the fear of desert storm which takes away half of your cards, adding a camp which bypasses one storm takes away a lot of what, I think, is most interesting part of the game - risk. The new monuments also lack the big-risk-big-reward flavour of the Pyramid, giving less incentive to players to hoard map cards (and risk losing them to the storm). But, you can the play the game as it originally was. 

The main idea of a game is collecting sets VS danger of losing them to storms or to another player via an occasional thief card. You can sell sets at any time - but more cards, more points. Seems okay, but the flow of the game is kinda slow (draw 1 card per turn from random draw deck). Plays can exchange card with central "market", where also all cards lost to storm end up. But the storms do wreck the economy and players never really recover, meaning players are unlikely to obtain high level cards from the market in later stages from the game. 

Solo game didn't impress me and not sure how much of this impression is the game and how much of it is soloing. Obviously it's something similar to Ticket to Ride (set collecting, slow building of hands), but the dramaturgy is different, Achaeology feels kinda drawn out as the game has a long end phase that feels like the end phase. (doesn't end on a high). I might even be willing to play Sushi Go over it, even if that one is fluffyer, but it's shorter. Probably as exciting... 

EDIT: Rating down. Just seemed uninspired, generic and too long.

Excellent card set game. Plays similar to Bohnanza the bean game in that there are are sets of cards of different types and the more you collect in set the more points they are worth. Simple but effective gameplay

I like this quite a bit.  It's exactly the kind of card game I had hoped to find when starting to get into modern board gaming.  Go to game with the mother-in-law.

The definitive version of this fun little filler. I've seen people online say they prefer the old artwork, and after having played both versions, I don't understand that at all. The new card layout is much better and the overall look is nice and fits well with the theme.

One thing to know about this game, though, is that it has a large push-your-luck element. A lot of people seem to be expecting a simple set collection game their first time. I was guilty of this before my first game. With this expectation, it can be frustrating to start losing cards to sandstorms and thieves. Once you approach it as a push-your-luck game, though, the game experience improves greatly. Now you have to decide to lay down those three coins for a few points, or hope to get one more before the next sandstorm hits so that you can get a much better score.

The addition of multiple different monuments will help with replayability, and the tents are a nice touch to help you defend against one sandstorm.

I got rid of the old version a while ago, but this one seems like a keeper. Just need to play some more to see where my rating will end up.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3-5[/b]
With two, you just steal cards back and forth using the thieves, and the market can get boring. The game gets more interesting with more players.

Since [thing=191300][/thing] is basically yhe same game as its earlier version, [thing=31105][/thing], I will pass on basically the same comments.

A nice game in the essence of the more famous Bohnanza (the more you get of something, the more is worth). Though no exchange can be made, there are cards for Thieves (which let someone take a card from another player) and the fearful Sandstorm (that make the players loose half, round down, of the cards currently in their hands to the market). There isn't much interaction between players (except when one is robbing another!), but the game is kind of fast, so it don't matter that much.

There is a timming pressure in the game, since the Sandstorms can really kill your plans, if you are holding too many cards - so players must always be weighting in the prospect of gaining more in the future and risking losing what they already have. There is also the considerations regarding the Pyramid: it has "chambers" with cards on them - the deeper the chamber, the more cards it has. In order to acess it, players need to use Map cards. One Map card can earn you 2 cards. Sweet. But two will net you 5 cards. Even better! Three Maps and you get in the inner chamber and gain 8 cards! But can you wait that much? If someone takes the first chamber cards, you will have to wait for another Map, and risking losing it to a Thief card.

[thing=31105][/thing] is this risk and hand management.

My problem with the game is the market. Since players lose cards to the market, after the Sandstorms, the Market can simply almost lock itself. Sure, you can gain one card per turn from the deck, but it can be too little to make the Market work for you again. There simply might be too costly cards in there, and they could keep there the whole game. I have some very uninteresting games due to this - the market became an afterthought and all there was left in the game was the luck of the draw.

[b]Now, for the main differences: [/b]
a) Now you have Tent cards, which lets players prevent one Sandstorm, which can be pretty key sometimes;
b) Different Monuments to explore. Before, there was only the Pyramid, and now there is the Temple, the Tomb, the Sphinx, the Buried Ruins and the Mine. The Pyramid still works as before. The other Momunents (you draw one at random at the start of each play) works differently, mostly changin the aspect of Maps/Cards (how much you will have to gain for how many Maps). The Sphinx and the Mine even add a push you luck aspect - not really necessary to a game already with a fine amount of luck, but, still, the others also have luck (as one pile of cards can be way better or worst than other), only in these two Monuments the players can at least have some control over it.

In the end, [thing=191300][/thing] is a slightly superior game, due to the added Monuments, which increase reaply value, and the Tent, which I should have thought myself to add, as the Sandstorms could really screw some plays. However, if you don't liked [thing=31105][/thing], [thing=191300][/thing] still won't work for you. It is the [b]same[/b] game, with a few small additions that don't change the feel nor the gameplay.

For me, is still a good enough filler.

Simple to learn and teach. Has worked with everyone I have played it with. Really fun having to decide what to trade for and when to sell things. You will learn to absolutely hate the sandstorms but they really make the game. Should be part of every game collection in my opinion. One of the games I use the most for getting new people into the hobby.

Simple, fun set collection games that changes depending on the tiles you draw. We have played standard, push your luck and with secret information. All of have been interesting and change things up enough to keep it interesting.

The tension from the thieves and sand storms keeps the game interesting and sometimes forces choices for the points I could have now versus the possible bigger payoff if I am willing to take a risk.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A good filler with a decent market system that's easy to teach. Some of the building tiles are significantly more interesting than others. Not a big fan of having to sift through the deck to set it up for each play considering the short play time.

Addendum: at this point I have minimal desire to play this game. I'll play it if requested, but only with certain monument tiles.

[b]Archaeology is my go-to gateway game for 3+ players[/b].

Newcomers are not intimidated by the rules reminiscent of family classics like rummy or scopa. Unlike Ticket to Ride, the game is not demanding time-wise.

Luck of the draw is what makes the game approachable and exciting, but the cards offer meaningful choices. My younger siblings can actually compete with our parents without frustration settling in.

The Z-Man artwork is beautiful and flavorful. The box is sturdy and the card stock feels high quality. I highly recommend Archaeology!

Slightly better than the original.  I don't know that it is worth purchasing if you have the original.  There are lots of small improvements to the payouts that I like.  Other changes can be easily moved into the old version.  The features that I looked forward to most in the new version (the new monuments) ended up being a disappointment for me.  Many ended up being far less interesting than I expected and made many of the games feel far more lucky than the original.  My wife and I weren't a fan of most of them.

Definitely worth getting if you don't have the original.  If you do have the original, 
I don't see this as a must get.  I had high expectations given how much we enjoyed the original.  It meets the level of the first game.  It just failed to provide the bump up that we were expecting.

Really nifty little filler - makes me think of playing games on rainy days or when the power is out. A bit like Jaipur in terms of the set collecting, but with some extra randomness thrown in the form of sandstorms (curse them!) and thieves. I really appreciate the different monuments to add some replayability too. The Indiana Jones fan in me definitely nudges the score up for this one too - the theme comes through much more than I would have expected.

Great filler, maybe even the best when it comes to small card games (although have still to try Biblios and it seems Tides of Madness is better for 2, but this one scales better) yet, as every small card game, even with generous offer of special locations, it ultimately wears out pretty soon.

A beautifully updated version of the original card game. I was always a fan of the game, but I was very happy to replace my original copy with this. 

One aspect of the game I really enjoy is how well it plays with different groups. It accommodates folks that just like UNO-type games, but it also seems to please more involved players. I've had a blast playing this with my mom.

Ilyen "tarsas"jatekkal meg nem talalkoztam! (lehet ezt annak nevezni?)
CD-rol szolo zorejek kozben, rohangalas az asztal korul, majd kovetkezzek egy tapadokorongos pisztollyal valo zombi-, es szornyvadaszat - es ha van meg mindezek utan energiad, akkor a felsoroltak kozben egy reflexjatekkal szorakoztathatod magadat. Mindezt 17 percben...
Nagyon nem szeretem az olyan jatekokat, ahol ki lehet esni - itt ki lehet. 
Megvaltas volt, amikor visszaérkezett - a meg eletben maradt jatekosokert  - a helikopter. (ez jelezte a jatek veget!)
Szamomra ez meg partijateknak is gyenguska...
(+1 pontot kapott, mert a tunya jatekosokat is egy kis testmozgasra tudja kesztetni a jatek!)

like many others I rate this game higher than how often I'd actually want to play. extremely fun party-dexteriety game, jungle speed doesn't even come close.

RATING: 8
What a fun game.  It's pretty ridiculous, but is a nice change of pace now and then.  At first you feel pretty silly shooting at the cardboard monsters, but by the end of the game when you're down to your last guy and your entire game depends on getting a shot off, it becomes quite tense!  Love the innovation.

RATING: 7
A treasure card collecting game with variations.
This is probably one that will appeal more to active little boys that like firing the tranquiliser gun (which is not too durable) and running round the table (or down the hall to avoid breakages). There is also the little bit of gruesomeness that comes from your squad members "dying" if you fail to complete a task (shoot a target, run round the table or redeal the discard pile). Although your team members could be resurrected by the witch doctor!

The CD (jungle day/night music dictates when treasure cards can be collected) is wonderfully atmospheric and definitely adds to the game, but does mean that it is a game for home, rather than travel.

Overall - great fun

What is it with the French and their love of the traditional card game Snap? While this game may have the same mechanics as Snap, the use of the audio soundtrack that you have to listen to in order to know when to snap and when not to snap, the need to run around the table, and the use of a toy pistol, give this game a very diffirent feeling. I won't say an adrenaline rush, but certainly a rush of some kind.

Got a cheap copy on Ebay. Sadly the gun didn't work and two of the darts were missing. I've since replaced the gun with a Nerf N-Strike Maverick six shooter gun. I'm ready to rock with this game as soon as I find a place I can safely play it...

Filler de 17 minutos que se juego con CD de música y en el que hay que alternar una serie de acciones según las cartas que van apareciendo: dar la vuelta a la mesa, disparar, repartir las cartas de nuevo...Original y muy divertido para jugar con niños (y no tan niños). La pistola está genial!!!

[Dexterity, Reflex] Picked up the Mattel version of this game for US$6 while passing through the Kuala Lumpur airport and stopping by a toy store. Had no idea this was by Roberto Fraga, the Mattel box had no designer credit. Of course, I didn't think of the trouble that trying to get a game with a toy gun in it through airport security might cause. Close to the x-ray machine, it suddenly occurred to me and I stuffed Squad Seven into my bag between Maharaja and Tramfabrik, hoping that the sheer amount of bits would mask the gun's outline. I made it through both the Kuala Lumpur airport security AND more interestingly, the Singapore airport security, and safely got my booty back home to Manila with nary an inquiry. *** UPDATE: Ok, so it's a kid's game. You can still have some fun with it! :) The remix on the game's website is a nice-to-have. Burn to redbook audio and keep in the box for the next time the kids come a-calling. [Rating for kids: 9]

This game is, effectively, a variant of the old game Slap Jack.  It's a really zany, well produced, fun variant, though.  Note to those opposed to fluff games: there is NO strategy to this one.  It is all quick reactions, running around the table and target shooting.  Fun with the right crowd.

I love it - I don't know why there aren't more games like this!  I guess one could argue that it's more of an activity than a game, but everything feels fresh.  The heart of the game is essentially a speed/recognition game, like Halli Galli.  But it's fun to frantically run around the table, shoot the dart gun or try to deal the cards back out to everyone.  The CD is an integral part of the game and adds an audio component that is rarely a part of a game (I can think of games like Snorta!, but even the CD in Space Dealer is purely an add-on, not necessary for game play).  I think Roberto Fraga must be a genius - he is one of my favorite game designers, along with Schmiel and Knizia.

I am not into dexterity games in the first place but this one gets old very quickly. I can't imagine anyone wanting to play this more than once. Slam your hands on the table in half a second to grab treasures whether you have the eyesight to see the snakes or not. I only started to catch up once I started to do this without thinking. Its ten minutes of mindless fun and then you can decide to trade it away.

Oh, for a rulebook as slick, attractive and well-designed as the fabulous dartgun that comes in the same package! A classic example of restricting the proofreading duties exclusively to those who already know the game, this is all the more crippling here because it neatly severs Squad Seven from the potentially huge audience it could have had.

Once you collectively decide on how you’ll actually play the game (and the rules and components at least help to restrict this decision to a sensible common ground), Squad Seven will give you 17 minutes of hectic, chaotic and hilarious fun. Without these preliminary decisions, the game will assuredly break down right in the midst of it, and that would be a shame, because you were just going to shoot that two-headed dinosaur.

Ayant comme destination le Musée d'Histoire Naturelle de Washington, un avion cargo chargé d'oeuvres d'art et autres trésors arrachés aux antiques cités Incas s'est écrasé dans une région reculée de la jungle amazonienne.

«Votre mission si vous l'acceptez» est de mener une équipe de 7 aventuriers pour récupérer un maximum de ces trésors. Votre Squad est débarqué au coeur de la jungle par un hélico et vous devez chercher ces trésors jour et nuit à travers un territoire dangereux et inexploré avant que l'hélico ne vienne vous récupérer.

Very crazy game I had been reluctant about. The box design is just awful! The game itself though is pretty funky and you need to be in a special mood for that one, if you got kids, you can always count on them, if playing with friends that don't look at it with friendly eyes... have 'em have a few glasses of alcoholic beverage first! It will be crazy fun hence forth! And those bloody 17 minutes take incredibly long... The gun alone is absolutely worth it (got the one from the first edition which looks kinda like sci-fi, the coil is pretty hard... which is cool :cool:!)

Typical with gadgets in games, faults occur such as here that 3 of the 6 darts tend to "dribble" out of the gun, rather than shoot out to reach the targets. Is this intentional? This can be infuriating for the competitors and fun for the onlookers.

RATING: 5.5
More fun in concept than in reality, though not terrible considering all of its component parts.  

It is basically slap jack with a gun to shoot targets.

The slapping part is done with more savvy in Jungle Speed, and you should be exited to get to shoot the gun rather than punished by it.

Then you get to take the time out to look for the darts in a real time game...grr.

Not much here, which is a bit of a disappointment, even when you play with the advanced rules (slapping penalties forces them on you).

But, it seems like it would be fun to play once every couple years at a con or something.

I normally love these kind of games, and it is good enough, but really there are better games like this out there.

BTW, the art is great, but it is a shame that they didn't line up the card art correctly (skulls to characters are wrong).

RATING: 4
Real-time soundtrack game most notable for its included dart-gun.

Players take rapid turns playing cards face up to the centre of the table and acting on them. Some are treasures to be picked up etc., but whether the action is legal depends on the time of day, as indicated by the soundtrack. Some cards are events, requiring an action to be taken before the next "scream" is heard -- the most fun of these involve the two-headed monster and the witch doctor, whose standees must be shot with the dart gun. Other events involve running around the table to simulate rushing across a collapsing rope bridge etc.

I'm not the target audience for this sort of game but I'm not really convinced that it works. The best aspects are the play-acting events, but they don't gel terribly well with the competitive real-time cardplay. It's something that I think would really work better as part of a co-op, and we have indeed seen movements in that direction with games like Space Alert, Spaceteam and Artemis.

It's a great novelty and good to try with kids, but probably not quite as good as other alternatives. I don't think the physicality works as well as it does in purer games like Dancing Eggs or Jungle Speed.

It's a blast. It fun and it's hilarious. The "rulebook" feels incomplete and it's certainly not the type of game you'd be playing with your "strategy only" game crowd, but it's highly entertaining as an experience. And very thematic in that you really feel like running through a jungle, sometimes because you're being chased by dinosaurs and sometimes because you want to sneak into an opponent players' camp.

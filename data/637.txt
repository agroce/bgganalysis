Love the game and especially when playing with lots of people like at PREZCON.  Card based strategy for NASCAR racing, simple to learn, hard to master - timing is everything and you have to pay attention to what your opponents are doing every minute!

Pretty good card based racing simulation!  A fast pace really makes this game a lot more fun.  The only bad point of this game is that a bad draw can ruin the game;  It's hard to get rid of a ton of pull away cards when you're losing the race!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
OK NASCAR sim game. Pretty boring throughout. The card decks for each player seem way too big. I didn't draw one draft an entire game. Plus, there is no risk management since the flags wipe everything out. You can make all of these aggressive moves and nothing happens to your car - Flag comes, and you're back to 7 cards like everyone else. Stay as close to the front as possible and hope you draw the right cards at the end.

RATING: 6
I think I understand what they were going for in this game. The card-driven element is pretty interesting.  The multiple uses for each card, and opportunity to manage hand-size with increasing risk actually provide some neat decisions.

The actions/responses are probably truer to what's going on in a race, but ironically I felt a lot less like I was racing.  When the cars barely move (only in relation to each other) I don't get the sense that we're going "12 laps" around the track.

Bottom line, I just found it mediocre as a game about racing. I don't think there is anything egregious wrong with the game.....I just didn't particularly have fun playing.

Few designs work well as both good simulations and good games, but this really captures much of the tension, back-and-forth, and strategy of stock car racing (as far as I can tell) in an elegant package. There are only a few types of cards in the game, making it quick to teach, and it scales up well. Since the the cards are all multi-purpose, the game rewards hand management and skill much more than first appears to be the case. The final lap is vital, but one will find that good players will end up ahead at the end of the race more often than not regardless.

RATING: 5
A solid racing game where each player plays with their own deck of cards.  Good rules impart the sense of racing, but the game does boil down to the last few card plays.  When you think about it, that&#039;s like real racing!

Good player interaction is the best feature of this game, although it can get repetitive as the laps roll on.  Advanced rules (tire points, &quot;nudge pass&quot;) are a must.

ALMOST a great game, but with too many "flip the wrong card and you lose" moments. The WBC final is certainly one of the top experiences in gaming.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A surprisingly fun card-based racing game. We played with tire points and 3 different choices for how to pit, and these added to the decisions for how to use the cards to make a satisfying play. There are some nice decisions here to go with the luck of the deck (it is a card game after all). 

I'm not sure there's anything more than tactical play here or that it's necessary to play for longer laps since it'll come down to the last 50 or so anyway, but I found it fun. The multi-use cards are cleverly implemented.

Great Game, I think it is the best Stock Car simulation out there.  The only downside is it is best with a lot of players, the more the merrier.  But none too good with 4 or less.

I encourage open hand discussion, with players making deals about supporting passed or allowing others to pass so they can draft behind.  But all bets are off at the end of the game, when the chrome horn comes out...

This is one of my five favorite games of all time.  I first saw it at an Origins convention where I was looking to pick up another game, took a flyer and couldn't stop thinking about the game on the trip home.  I am not a huge NASCAR fan but this game is so good it turned me into one.  What's great about it is, that unlike many sports and racing themed games, it excels both as a great simulation and also as a great game.  Sure, there's luck involved but there is also luck in real racing, too.  (Mechanical troubles, mostly)  But the guts of the game is about card management.  Also, as other posters have stated, where the game really sings is with all the advanced and optional rules which include things like Green Flag Pit Stops, Tire Wear, Fuel Mileage, Two-Lane Racing and racing with two-car teams.  It is also a game that can be played with just about any number (well more than two or three) -- you can fix the time by deciding how many laps you will run -- and you can easily accomodate any late-comers just by putting them at the back of the pack starting next turn.  Only bad news is the game is pretty much out of print, hard to get, and second-hand copies go for double to triple the original price at most auctions.  Love to see the designers get together and put out a third edition.

tweaking the rules for a local con

I have set up a race for up to 15 players, short track, going with normal width, expansion cards in play.

aiming for 400 laps, using the nudge pass chart AND importantly, we are playing passes CAN be made between adjacent cars as players can force their way thru, we are calling these passes SQUEEZE PASS where if the final speed numbers from a challenge are equal in the playtest then a nudge result is checked! 

this also applies to passes against the inner and outer wall, we only had one instance in the plates where this needed to be checked, I think I will bump up the check number to 50 pts

nudge is at 100 in total between the two miraculously we had 7 cars have to check ( we have drafters check too ) not one car flipped a wreck or high in turn!

anyway, gonna bump the number to 50 and with a nudge\squeeze make it 150

lane shifts of one or two lanes allowed in ONE shift, one shift per turn either before actions or after

a car may not end its turn against the wall

IF a two wide is played in the racing lane where an open space is beside the two wide car, then player cars can play a pass to go around the two wide, but no sqeeze between a two wide and a car allowed!

that's about it

This game is a fantastic fun time. The rules as written are complicated and do a great job of simulating a lead pack in a NASCAR race. However, we usually play the much simpler WBC rules, that are simply more fun and easier to grasp. 

If you ever make it to the WBC do yourself a favor and play this game. The heat races are really simple, but the final race where some of the more advanced rules are used really shines. 24 - 30 races is good times. 

This game is beer friendly.

Love this game. Hard to get new product as the creator only sells the game during WBC. I bought several games/decks over the years and will have them sleeved as I don't see this game being sold anymore. Has ways to play solo with dummy cars so you can play a season. This game is a keeper. Gives adults a reason to buy those matchbox size stock cars and play with them. It's all good when you are playing this great card game that simulates the passing aspect of NASCAR.

1.5 playings of an abstract cardgame that is pretty straightforward; moreso that is apparent from the rulebook. The hand-management aspect of play was mostly obvious and the final outcome much more a matter of luck than skill (future playing may alter that balance assessment a little). But be advised, this is not a racing game.

RATING: 8
Without question, the game that best simulates NASCAR racing. Features a track positioning mechanic, but pit strategy makes the difference (at least in the advanced version). Flip the track card to determine the number of laps covered that turn. Each driver plays a number of cards necessary to equal or exceed the lap count for the track card (drafting is an option). The player can then use his remaining card action for passing and blocking. Includes separate decks for each driver, pit stops and lap counts. Have eight driver decks and all four tracks (super speedway, 1 mile oval, road, and short track).

 [COLOR=#006600] • 12 players: [/COLOR] A few times at PrezCons - Side by side.  Once with full Pit rules. (Excellent!)
 [COLOR=#006600] • 14 players: [/COLOR] At PrezCon - Side by side.  14 to 16 is ideal.
 [COLOR=#006600] • 16 players: [/COLOR] Twice at PrezCons - Side by side.  I imagine that any more than sixteen players would mean too much downtime.

[COLOR=#006600]Instructions: [/COLOR]Daunting
[COLOR=#006600]Learning Curve: [/COLOR]Easy — for basic rules.  Full rules are not difficult, but I think it's best to learn them only after having gained familiarity with the basic rules.
[COLOR=#006600]Depth: [/COLOR]Hand management is both tactical and strategic (particularly the use of Response cards to manipulate play order)
[COLOR=#006600]Luck: [/COLOR]Most luck of the draw can be mitigated by thoughtful card play, [i]but[/i] some draws can be devastating. 
[COLOR=#006600]Downtime: [/COLOR]I find other players' turns engaging, but for those who don't, there is still involvement as long as you are not well behind those who have not played yet, as you may be able to respond to the plays of those immediately before or behind you.
[COLOR=#006600]Fiddliness: [/COLOR]The cars on the track are constantly manipulated, and cards must be played with certain orientations.  
[COLOR=#006600]Components: [/COLOR]The cards are sturdy and functional.  It's the die cast cars (not included) that really deepen the atmosphere.
[COLOR=#006600]Player Interaction: [/COLOR]Passing, drafting, and challenging all involve players regardless of turn order.
[COLOR=#006600]Conflict: [/COLOR]None to speak of.  
[COLOR=#006600]Theme: [/COLOR]The mechanics were clearly built around the theme.  Adding die cast cars really reinforces and enhances the racing theme.

[COLOR=#006600][b]Comments: [/b][/COLOR]

See my geeklist "My PrezCon 2008" (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/30634) for way too much verbiage.  And note that the comments for McGartlin Motorsports are divided between several entries on the Geeklist (items 4, 8, 14, and 18), so do scroll down.

At PrezCon 2011, we played in an invitational session (outside of the tournament) where the full pit rules were used.  Full pit rules are awesome! Each pit matters, and the gas tank (limited draw deck) makes for meaningful choices.  

Over the years, I've heard complaints that the game really boils down to the portion of the game following the last mandatory pit stop.  Everything up to this point can be rendered meaningless by the order in which players exit the pits.  This viewpoint has [i]some[/i] merits, particularly for the basic game.  However, in the [u]full[/u] game, while pitting is necessary, it is not [i]mandatory[/i], so players choose when and how to pit.  Players can therefore use pitting to shape the makeup of the remainder their draw decks.  I've only played this way once, but I found it engrossing throughout.

[COLOR=#006600][b]Why we own it: [/b][/COLOR] 

I only get to play this at PrezCon each year, and over the course of those few days I play several times.  Every year I'm reminded of how great this game is.  Particularly during the Finals, as I find the side-by-side race with 12 to 16 players the high point of the entire Con.

Not only do we own this, we own over 20 matched sets of 1/64th and 1/24th scale die cast cars.  It's deeply thematic and downright fun.  Of course, I've been spoiled by racing with Jon Zug, who is both a NASCAR fan and an excellent race leader.

[2 plays] Initial reaction rating.  I like car racing games in general.  Even though they deviate from my typical taste of dry strategy games I always find it fun and exciting to see who will win in race games.  I am glad I got to try out this game as it is a hard one to find.  Sure there is plenty of luck in what cards you draw and what cards the person you are trying to pass has.  However, I still found the experience of playing this game just all around fun.  It is too bad that this is not in print, or I would pick up a few decks just to have as a social, light game when people came over.

Played with the basic rules once and it wasn't anything that great. The only reason to pit is to remove bad event cards.
  
Played it again with advanced rules and advanced challenges and the game became pretty cool. It gives you some reasons to pit. You can get out of the lead draft and try to get back in it. Advanced challenges allow the person behind the car trying to pass to pick one of the two cars to draft during the pass. This lets them move ahead a space if they pick the winner and makes the cost of losing the challenge more severe. Good stuff.
  
With 4 players and advanced rules going to the pit wasn't too much of a decision since you didn't lose too many positions. Probably needs to be played with 7 or more to make this something to consider.

UPDATE: Played with 5 and 2 NPC drivers it seemed to work well. People enjoyed it.

This is a fun and exciting simulation of NASCAR without the speed. Card management is essential. The advanced rules should always be played.

A quick disclaimer, we played this incorrectly thinking there was no hand limit, so we had a huge number of cards to play from, which affected the strategy tremendously.  I prefer this card-driven game over Formula Motor Racing, for one due to the lack of die roll, and the other is the variety of cards as well as their synergy with each other.

After 1 Play: There's a lot of fiddly nonsense for a game that will be decided by luck in the final two turns.

This game does a great job of simulatiing the feel of a real stock car race.

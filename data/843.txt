Great multi-player.
You use a number of options to create your chariot then you race.
Similar to Circus maximus but with more options.
Similar to Speed Circuit but ancient.

Played too long, and the endgame is ridiculous since it's easy to take over other chariots once you are dismounted.  We did have fun, but it was just too broken to try again.  I'd rather go the Maximus route.

A little long (a lot of people like to play 2 instead of 3 laps, but two laps is too short for there to be any strategy). The real show-stopper is in the rules for &quot;jumping&quot; chariots, however - it seems the best strategy is to dismount on the start line, and wait on the median to jump the winning chariot. For a real game, probably best to play without either the &quot;cocky leader/catchup&quot; and &quot;dismounted driver&quot; rules.

Great game, might be tough to get a crowd of like minded people together.  A little longer and more violent than a typical Euro, but much lighter than a war game.  That being said, it can be a gut buster with the right crowd!  Love it.  Much smoother and a much better game imho than circus maximus.

Confusing, illogical, and annoying rules (there are several ways for a man on foot to outrun a chariot).
The game is nice until you get through the first corner (basically turn 3) and then it just gets bad.

Fun game that stays tense until the very end. You'll definitely feel the exhaustion of the teams as the race draws to a close. Don't look for realism however, dismounted charioteers can shamelessly try to jump on another player's chariot and try and take it over!

The basic movement rules manage to be at the same time simpler and more realistic than Circus Maximus.  The combat rules, on the other hand, are pure WWF and I don't use them.

Simple, funny, somewhat anarchic.  Great fun.  The Gunslinger of chariot racing.

My second daughter won our last race with my driver falling off the team of horses he was riding (and being crushed) just as he was about to cross the finish line first.  She then mortally wounded her little sister's driver in the shadow of the winning post, before cantering over the line for the win ...

I played Mike Chase's Mega Circus Minimus at KublaCon 2002. Anthony Gallela, Andy Chambers and some KC staffers played. It was a hoot. We ran one lap. I came in second in the race and second for most carnage inflicted. Andy snipped my kill ( Anthony's driver was knocked onto the track when I rammed his chariot and Andy finished him off. ) It was a lot of fun.

Own the rulesbook only.

We brought this to the table again, with a few house rules.  Confirmed that it can be a fun game, if played right...

I was awarded this game for "winning" Twilight Struggle at Dragon Flight 2010. I didn't actually win my game, but my opponent was the host of the game and the other 2 players had left, so he gave the prize to me.

From a test run this game is a challenge to say the least...  my better half flipped her chariot with a dangerous skid in the first turn and then I did the same thing!  You really need to pick you fights carefully and keep the high speeds for the straight-aways or you'll be toast!

A little too fiddly of a racing game for me, with checking the charts for various dice rolls (flipping, getting dragged, etc.), and the oval track is boring.  I would always vote to play Formula D/De over this one.

This game is fun for the first 15-20 minutes.  After that, I'm hoping the game ends as soon as possible.  It's not that much of a simplication from Circus Maximus.  There are still too many rules for this type of game.

Some fiddely and unclear rule segments in here. The rules on how to handle the turns are sound however, which makes for a good base for any chariot racing game.
Not sure if the horses regain their strength too fast though.

Good game.

Though perhaps not universally loved, I have enjoyed this game each time I've played it.  Coming from a Dungeon Master role in D & D, it was quite easy to come up with a way to integrate events that are not in the realm of the rules structure, yet, could arguably occur.  

For example, when a 'running charioteer' tries to take a chariot from another player who is about move by him...rather than a die-roll and a) the running charioteer knocks the mounted charioteer out of the chariot, and the running charioteer gets the chariot, leaving the newly dismounted charioteer on foot, or b) the running charioteer misses the chariot.  What I do is give c) the charioteer on foot a chance to 'latch ahold' of the chariot passing by, and then fight for control of the chariot.  Here, the two must fight for a full turn, , then on the second and subsequent turns they try to wrest control of the chariot from the other...

Perhaps I'll write up this variant and add all the modifiers and such for others to use...

With little tweaks like this, I quite like it!

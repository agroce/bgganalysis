:thumbsup: There is an enormous degree of variability with the way each play differs in terms of spells, disasters, and more.
:thumbsup: Each play is a unique puzzle with the room configurations, and working through every turn is fun.

[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]The quality of some of the miniatures is a bit lacking, although not to a significant degree.
[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]The memory element can be a little frustrating, yet it can easily be removed if desired.

:thumbsdown: Setup can take quite some time and differs significantly from scenario to scenario.
:thumbsdown: Rotating or moving rooms can be a little fiddly with the way other elements need to be moved back into place.

Wizard's Academy's scenario has some promise. Novice wizards are called upon to defend the academy from various threats.  At start we lack the wherewithal to cast the simplest spell. Glyphs must be gathered and what various combinations will do must be learned by trial and error.  With some luck, an entertaining puzzle can unfurl nicely.  With worse luck you can spend a couple of hours achieving hardly anything as you run around in circles.

Production quality is decent, although the miniatures fall some way short of the best standard.  The artwork is quite lovely.  Dividing rules between two booklets has never seemed a good idea to me and Wizard's Academy hasn't changed my opinion.

Very clever simulationist game that just didn't click for us. Has an annoying and from what I recall somewhat unnecessary memory element, and turns sometimes devolve into a sequence of knock-on events that feel a bit like Flowchart Simulator 2016.

I was impressed, but not eager to play it much. Others will almost certainly love it.

Interested in backing this one when it makes it to Kickstarter. The theme is right up our alley.
Update: Didn't back the kickstarter due to the high price. I just don't really want to pay extra for minis. I played the print and play. It was an ok game, but nothing I'm dying to try again.

Just played through introductory game, terrific, looking forward to advanced version. Edit: advanced version a bit of a struggle, too complicated by far and the rule book(s)  is(are) terrible. If this game were worked over and streamlined it could be great.

Played two handed solo with the Tabletop Simulator DLC.  Solid game.  But my games have been pretty uneven depending on the luck in the order of drawing spell cards.

It sat on my pile of shame for a pretty long time. And that was a big mistake.
I really like the spell-book-board-type-mechanic-thing where you cast spells according to the glyphs you have without knowing what will happen.

"I use this glyph and that one to cast...
Oh sh*t, I summon an Imp."
Not really that dangerous but I loved that hilarious situation.

I'm looking forward to playing this again soon.

After playing the complete game and one of the scenarios I'm becoming more impressed. This is well designed, easy to play, hard to win. Not unbeatable but hard enough that it stays interesting.

I am really, really impressed with this game. I backed the KS at the last minute on a whim, and after many other poorly-considered KS disappointments I didn't have high hopes for this.

After we played our first game, I was exuberant. It's probably in my top 5 favorite KS games ever (of some 200 backed). The game is tense, fun, challenging, and truly cooperative, as you have to work together to collect runes and diversify your spells. The room/spell mechanics are brilliant, and the game presents a really interesting puzzle, with a little bit of risk/randomness with the card draws. I also love the "botched" spell mechanic, which you can sometimes even exploit by deliberately casting if you can use their effects.

Now all the game desperately needs is expansion content. PLEASE!!! GIVE US AN EXPANSION!!!!

A unique take on co-op board games. To try to defeat quarterbacking, the design overwhelms players with complexity. There's just so much going on that it requires a lot of focused attention to even know what the next turn is going to look like. Instead of a board game, the effect is that of a giant multiplayer jigsaw puzzle. Because of this, it has a steep learning curve and I wouldn't encourage playing with casual gamers. But the theme comes through well and it's incredibly satisfying when you have an "Aha!" moment and see a way to use a bad spell to achieve a good effect or something like that.

RATING: 8.5
A very well-designed game, and I'd say it's probably the overall best co-op game I've played to date. A few favorite mechanisms:

- After playing a Disaster card at the beginning of your turn, drawing another immediately, thus giving insight among all players into what will be happening. Sure, sometimes bad coincidences with spells come up, but in general, the lack of unknown uncertainty is very low. Nicely done.

- The fact that botches are not always entirely negative, at least at lower levels. The fact that some can be used to positive effect (with a known tradeoff) is quite interesting and well thought out.

- The threat interactions are awesome. They don't happen much, but the long list of possible interactions are very cool and give players some interesting tactical options.

- The wand, staff, and robe mechanisms, which allow a player to use glyphs to create magical items of their choice. This is just an awesome layer of customizability, and I only wish that in practice it could be done more frequently.

- Glyph sharing, whose most basic purpose is to reduce the amount of frustration on a player's turn, but which also provides some interesting choices (share or not; which to share? which shared glyph to use?). The fact that you don't have to be in the same room to share is  expedient and not very thematic, but simply works too well to fret over; it's mechanisms like these that herald a designer who is both aware of how game mechanisms affect players' enjoyment, and one who is able to make well-considered thematic tradeoffs to improve it.

- Other small details, like the choice of academy improvements at the beginning of a scenario, the dimension spells, the escalation mechanic, and many more.

The one thing I wish were more present in the game is more emotional resonance when certain events occur or when taking certain actions. The characters are well-imagined, and the game could benefit from some narrative elements involving them. For example, I'd love for the escalation deck to include one-shot events that present a difficult choice to the players along with a bit of narrative, similar to Crossroads cards in Dead of Winter.

Imagine that on each reshuffle of the Disaster deck, a story card is added (so in addition to 2 Disasters, also add a story card). The story cards could be progressive, so that the story unfolds as players proceed through the escalation deck. That one little bit of theme would be the cherry on top of an already excellent game.

Played PnP version. Too long for what it offers. The first half of the game isn't that interesting. There are some neat ideas in the game but I feel the pace is too slow. The interactions of the different game elements provides interesting ways to solve the puzzles, but also adds complexity and a lot of corner case rules.

Component quality - specifically the minis - are among the worst I have ever seen. This is especially annoying given that it cost $235 on Kickstarter for a game containing 41 "high quality resin minis." One would expect component quality of a Cool Mini or Not game or better at that cost but instead receives minis half the size of my thumb with poor detail - some of the minis smaller than nail clippings. A total rip off!!!

Players take on the role of a new student in a Wizard's Academy. Over time, spells are botched or learned and used to prevent some sort of catastrophe within the school. Mana is gained (and can sometimes be shared) to cast spells that are available to each player. Threats must be dealt with as well. This game requires careful planning and a bit of luck. Some of the events can be a little random, but the game is enjoyable overall.

A very good co-op game, with more going on than the likes of Pandemic, which will also account for the longer play time, easily the 120 minutes listed on the box.

The theme of incompetent magic students having to rise to a dread challenge is very strong and replayability is assured with the different  scenarios, the set up of the play area (in the form of tiles for rooms in the Academy) and the mix of spells and disasters available in each play.

The game plays smoothly, except the Grimoire has been an essential item by my side so that I could check all of the details about how threats activate, endure, interact and affect the game; I haven't been able to, yet, lodge all of the many details in my mind, but I'm getting there.

It's a long game, so I don't get it to the table as much as I'd like, but every game has been full of interesting surprises. This is the best co-op I know of for being reminded that I'm not as smart alone as a group that includes me. All the different combinations of spells and rooms and disasters create so many options, and many of them are wonderfully silly. Also, it's just lovely to look at. One of my favorites.
I also have this on TTS, so that's an option!

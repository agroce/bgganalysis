RATING: 6
Nice little 2 player game / variant on it's parent. The variety of buildings in the expansions makes at least one of them essential though if you wnat to keep playing
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
As it pertains to Agricola, this is what the game should have been. Admittedly, I mostly play 2 player games, so this fits much better than "regular" Agricola. This plays fast and easy, and while it can also suffer from "samey-ness", it still seems fun. Probably because it only takes 20 to 40 minutes to play - which is the "right" amount of time for an Agricola game, in my opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
It's not nearly as tight of a game as it's bigger brother, and it plays in 35 minutes which is a super plus for us (fills a niche in that regard). The two expansions are mandatory and really save the game for repeated plays, and also help reduce the desire to play Caverna or big Agricola. The current rating is also taking into account that we always use the expansions with it, for without, the game would fall much lower. Unfortunately, it's interaction is limited to traditional worker placement action drafting/deprivation in terms of snatching points. Given that there isn't a large decision space in terms of scoring points, the expansions essentially save it from dropping to a 3.

Tight worker placement game where the aim is to develop an animal farm. I really like this game but I wish the first expansion wasn't impossible to get - the only thing missing in the game is more buildings!

Sold, despite that I like the game a lot. Since I got Agricola: Revised Edition I can't justify owniing this. Will probably never play it again.

RATING: 7
A 2-player only game about animal husbandry that retains significant similarities/flavour of Agricola, but which also is interesting enough on it's own merit.

The game lasts 8 rounds, with the mechanic being worker placement, of which each player has 3 workers (there is no family growth).  The action spaces are fixed for the game.  The goal is to score the most points, with points being scored via: 1) animals (this is where most of the points are scored, with 1 point per animal, with bonuses for increasing numbers, and a negative penalty for too few of a type(s)), 2) buildings, and 3) farm expansions.

Actions range from collecting resources (wood, stone, reed), building fences/pastures, building stables, building buildings, upgrading buildings, expanding your farm space, collecting animals, and choosing start player (plus wood).  The mechanics of action selection, animal breeding, building, animal housing etc. are the same as Agricola; there are no occupations, improvements, feeding (no harvest stress).  The game is quite tight and plays quickly and intuitively.  Excellent components, very portable and reasonably priced.  Overall, a very successful streamlined variation of an aspect of Agricola.  

Own the [boardgame=130752]More Buildings- Big and Small[/boardgame] and the [boardgame=145355]Even More Buildings[/boardgame] expansions.

I'm not a big fan of the original 'Gric.  Maybe it was the people playing or the randomness of the cards but it just did not do it for me.

This little game, however, is rapidly becoming a favorite.  Excellent components, fun game mechanics, and interesting choices make this one a lot of fun.  It would get repetitive and possible to "solve" if you only have the base game.  The first expansion is almost necessary for this one if you plan on playing it repeatedly.  I haven't opened the second expansion yet but I assume it will be more of the same re: the first expansion.  I'm just a completest.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable filler game based on the animal husbandry aspects of Agricola and without the food requirements. I received with the first expansion together so I likely would have rated this a '6'. Since there wasn't too many buildings and four of them are the same in every game I felt the game could get dull before too long. The expansion adds plenty to take care of that.

It lacks a lot of what I love about Agricola - the diverse options for your farm in the bigger game makes your final board setup feel very personal to you. Not so in ACBAS. Everything is so tight. However, the mechanic is nice, and the game is short, so I suppose it serves a purpose.

Fun 2 player variant of Agricola. Moves quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It is truly a reduced version of Agricola, entirely about gathering (and multiplying) pigs, sheep, horses and cows. The action spaces are constrained just enough to ensure interaction and competition. There's the simple joy of building a farm while also troubled with choices and managing resources properly. It's very nice, comfortable, well-designed and fast to play. The farm gets overly crowded at times which feels unnecessary and clutters an otherwise clean experience. Still, good game - compressed Agricola.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
wonderful 2-player game. short, but deep enough. If leaves you with the feeling of playing through AGR, but in 20 minutes. Longevity is a weak as, being a 2 player game, you would likely play this with the same person. Games would start being very similar. would probably dry out after 15-20 plays for the same couple. However, with the building expansions, that goes out the window, literally unlimited replayability.

A very good 2-player game with just the right complexity/length ratio. Just make sure you have the first expansion because otherwise I believe that the game will start repeating itself very soon. A little more variance from game to game would have given this title some longevity.

RATING: 7.95
This is an excellent, quick way to get an [I]Agricola[/I] fix when there just isn't time for the full game--and actually, I'd say this is a good enough game to work on its own without the direct reference to its parentage.  

Certainly more 'enjoyable' than Agricola, meaning that it can be played somewhat more casually and that there isn't the same level of pressure; however, an expansion is a must to maintain long-term replayability, as the four special buildings that come with the base game alone don't provide enough different paths to victory. 

This has become our go-to travel game--all the expansions can fit in the base box, and the base box is tiny (notwithstanding the fact that it still comes with a bunch of animeeples). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
What a wonderful variant on a given theme. Just similar enough to Agricola to retain a sense of familiarity, while focused enought to provide an entirely new gameplay experience. It is a tight affair for two players which really delivers within a good timeframe, long enough to matter, short enough to immediately replay!

Very good destilation of Agricola. Tight and engaging game in 30 min. I have only played the basic game and there is a lot of room for competition and variation. I am planning to get one of the expansions. Since I have only done that with very few games, it can be considered a very good signal. Rating may go up.

Update: Rating went up and I got the first expansion. These small tiles bring a lot of variation to the game. Great small game.

This is light variant of the classic game for two players. You have limited choices, basically you have to acquire as many animals as possible. It lacks the harvest phase of the original which removes the pressure from the gameplay. It is fun and light-hearted. Not the best in the two-player genre.

I was not a fan of Agricola the one time I played it, but it has long been on my "must play one more time before I write it off" list. Agricola Big and Small, in addition to being Agricola Lite, is also a wife friendly game. 

The game played well, and for the first time I saw why people like Agricola. I'm not sure I'll suddenly be a fan of Uwe, but at least I appreciate better what he's designing. And I definitely have to play Agricola one more time. 

+1 for having tons of cool animeeples.

Indeed, it felt exactly what half of Agricola was. The mechanics of worker placement game stands out immediately on your first game turn.

Learning curve is relatively light. 8 year old son got the idea in less than 10 mins.

It is fun when both gamers are of equal skills or exposure to this game. The winner will always be the one with better experience on this game. When that happens, the game becomes dry and annoying to play, especially on the inexperienced. 

Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and it felt better than playing Chess. 

Components are good and beautiful. Light fast Agricola, but the enjoyment compared to the larger cousin is somehow lacking. 

A good effort in a small box.

All Creatures Big and Small falls completely flat as a two player game. There's hardly any tension at all. It's got a solid worker placement skeleton, but the ways to get points are painfully obvious and boringly easy. I don't think it's actively 'bad' per se, but I do not enjoy it.

What this game does well is distill the 'fun' farm-building of Agricola without the stress.  The reason this casual variant of the full game works so well is because its portable and quick to set up, and with the expansion buildings adds a good dose of variation to the mix as well.  My wife and I pack this for all our road trips.

This game is great. It definitely fills the niche of small box, quick playtime, yet still packing a punch. I agree with the assessment that at least one expansion is necessary. Because there is no luck it hasn't been a hit with all my playing partners, but it's a keeper nonetheless. My enjoyment of this has me interested in Caverna.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a nice two player game that, not surprisingly, fits nicely and squarely within the Agricola franchise.  If you like Agricola, as I do, you will likely enjoy this game.  In essence, this game takes a fun piece (the raising and housing of animals) of an already incredibly well designed game (Agricola) and places it into a short two player game.

In All Creatures, you experience the joys of worker placement, building things, acquiring and breeding sheep, pigs, horses and cows, and trying to figure out how to structure your farm yard to accommodate all those animals.  Sheep, sheep everywhere!  

Likely, this game is more a 7 of 10 for me, but considering this is a quick, two player euro with excellent mechanics, theme and components (love the horses), gonna give it a bump up to an 8.  I do miss the dogs and emeralds of Caverna!

Elegant: a word that describes perfectly this game.
Everything is equilibrated, intuitive (even if abstract as in every euro-game) and fits with the theme, and in the box (extension included). Setup is easy and fast, playtime is relatively short, downtime is short too.

The perfect game for two players travelling.It's also a very good introduction for your girlfriend to boardgames: the theme is nice, the meeples are adorable and the tactical choices are large (all equivalent). On this point, it is superior to the original agricola, where all layouts tend to be similar. It's not the case in this little game. Even if you lose, you have a good time creating a different farm each time and trying new strategies.

My new go to cafe game! A lot of game in a small box. Doesn't have the stress of trying to feed your family, but still has the spacial arrangement, animal collecting, resource management feel of full Agricola. Plus it has the "need more actions" angst which should be present in all worker placement games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My only real concern is the static layout, which would seem prone to settler-quarryism once one has a lot of game experience.  I think the resource-for-points building could mitigate that by itself though, if people aim for a long-term strategy using it.  Anyway, I love the space this fills as a real game for 2P which is totally doable in 30 minutes - including setup and scoring.  Not too light, not too heavy, and I'd rather play it over anything in the Kosmos line.  This is sure to see a lot of play.

Traded. I love its aesthetically pleasing components and quick playing time, but as many said it's a totally different game when compared to its parent. While I can see some people liking this as a completely different game, I think the game suffers a lot by losing variability. The game starts to feel same-y after few plays and it left me more of a puzzle feel than thematic experience that Agricola gives, which also led me to think this is a bit overproduced for what it is.

The best two player game I have played yet, all things considered. And I have some great two player games! Takes the pain and suffering out of Agricola (which was actually fun), and some of the brain-melting choices, and leaves only the shiny fun bits. And it looks lovely. And is in a small, portable box. And doesn't take long. If you only have one other player, it is a must.

Végre sikerült kipróbálnom az Agricola kistestvérét. Kellemes meglepetés: letisztult, ki van belőle szedve az etetés, és ezzel az Agricolára annyira jellemző szűkösség eltűnt. Zöldségek sincsenek, és épületből is csak néhány van, nagyon egyszerűsített formában. Végül is majdhogynem egy állatszaporítós szimuláció az egész, ahol nagy baj nem történhet, csak az a kérdés, hogy 30 vagy 50 állatunk lesz-e a végére. Az állattartással kapcsolatos alapszabályok nem nagyon változtak. Összességében ha valakinek csak fél órája van, és úgy akar játszani, hogy az Agricola feelingje meglegyen közben, akkor ez tökéletes választás, még ha a nagy testvér jobb is. Az épületek száma miatt indokolt lehet kieggel játszani (én nem is játszottam kieg nélkül).
Körökkel jobb, mint a Le Havre 2 személyes.

I had fun with this, but the more I play it, the more I am bothered by the logic of it all. Enlarge your farm so you can breed more animals. Repeat several times. Imagine having two cats at home. One cat has a litter of kittens, but instead of putting the kittens up for adoption, you decide you need a bigger home.

The animeeples go down a storm with both boys even if strategy is a bit beyond them. Seven year old just wanted to raise horses, but with a bit of help pulled out a respectable score in the high 30s, though he was disappointed that he lost to my score in the 50s. I've explained it is about bettering his own score rather than trying to beat an adult at games like this! 

Edit: Raised rating now that I have the first expansion which feels like it completes the game by making it sufficiently different each time (a bit like the occupations/improvements in its big brother).

I found it nice and enterteining.  It's short, plays fine, and has very good components.  I don't think it is even comparable with Agricola, it's just the setting.  I don't know how replayable this could be.  Probably not much, since there are very few buildings... so here comes the expansion :)

Take Agricola, remove cards and need to feed, limit it to animal breeding, and you have a pleasant no-luck tactic game that lasts 30 minutes and plays very smoothly!

The game is clearly designed with non-gamers in mind, but is nevertheless enjoyable even by hardcore gamers as a 2-player filler.

I guess it would greatly benefit by more buildings (hey, it seems an expansion is already out there!)...

Normally I don't play a lot of two player games, but because Agricola isn't a bad game with two, I wanted to play this game also.

RATING: 10
Outstanding 2-P game! This and Morels both came out in 2012 and I predict both will eventually become classics. Both are rated a 10 for us. If you play a lot of 2-P games, you must get both of these.

ACB&S shows that Rosenberg is back on track for those of us who like smaller games with a good dose of tactical play. We don't like games that last 2+ hours so have had no interest in his recent lengthy offerings.

ACB&S has plenty of tough decisions along with different winning strategies. You never have enough time to do even half of what you would like, so take your losses and maximize your strengths. It's a highly enjoyable but tense game and my wife loves it.

She even read over the rules before and after our first few plays. In over 4 years of gaming she has NEVER done that before. This gives a clear idea of why this game is a 10 for us!

UPDATE: We have played this game every day for the past week. My wife talks about it during the day and is striving to learn which tactics work best. No other game has ever received such attention from her! Wow, what a game!

When you are looking for a little 2p variety, this game is a wonderful addition. Has the great feel of building and growing *your* settlement, with a good play time and tight decisions. There may be a little denial play (taking resources that the other player needs) but it is never spiteful. You take the resources because you need it as much as they do.

However, one or both expansions are pretty necessary to stop the game feeling samey, given the lack of setup variability in the box.

I generally like woker placement games and I wouldn't have thought there was a need to have a short game of this style. However, I find what this little game achieves to be remarkable in the time! You have worker placement and battle for those spots with a nice tension. You have cool little animeeples that you want to see just how many of them you can get together. You have the complexity of, how do I get to boost all those animals, and at the same time, make space to home them? How to arrange my fencing? If it worth going for this building now instead of taking that nice mound of resources or animals?

I think this is an excellent introduction to strategic worker placement games, that is a lot of fun and is very enjoyable to play for seasoned worker placement fans when you want something shorter.

It's not in my top ten games but it is a cracker, I have to score it a 10.

The base game really could have been bundled with some expansion content, but is surprisingly replayable. When combined with the expansions this is a 9 for me. I think that combination is one of the best values in 2P gaming. A fairly deep game, both strategic and tactical, and quick playing. My go-to game for 45 minutes with 2. 

(I've rated the expansions 9's as a reflection of them all combined)

This lets us scratch the Agricola planning/building/

to essentially plan ahead of time for eight rounds, but
needing to adapt and change your plan as the game
progresses.

Both my wife and I enjoy the game. It's fun and strategic with which resources you pick and where you put your workers. The initial play through was difficult because the rule book is fairly meaty. But, once we figured out the rules, the games flow pretty quickly and smoothly. One other fun aspect is building your farm and placing your little wooden animals. It doesn't have direct conflict(as in battling your opponent) but the other player choosing what you were going to pick can throw a wrench into your plans really quick!

It's a fun game for two people and would recommend that others give it a try, even if they don't know if they like worker placement games.

Relax-and-manage-your-farm game. Interesting decisions with regards to:

1) Which animals to pursue
2) Where to place them
3) Timing of actions
4) Purchase/upgrades of building tiles
5) Expanding of your farm pastures.

Packs a meat for a 2 players game! You have so much to do but so little time. 8 rounds is all you have.

It's a clever little game and a surprisingly compact port of some of the ideas of Agricola into a casual two player game. I've only played once and I intend to play it again, but it didn't grab me as much as other two player games did on their first play (such as 7 Wonders: Duel, Battle Line, Summoner Wars). What is a little bit of a turnoff is that one is encouraged to chain one's moves so far in advance that the pressure is on a bit not to make an error in that chain, that ending up for me (at least) being the decisive factor in one getting behind. I suppose blocking is a factor...but with one player maybe it can be part of that chain of reasoning...I think I'd just prefer something else. Maybe if I were more of a pure Euro fan I'd be won over. A number of gamers I really respect think highly of it, so I definitely need to give it more chances for me.

Played with the expansion - it was 'ok' but a bit dull and really felt like a VP race/optimisation game/puzzle.

Scoring seemed overly complicated, why? Because it's an Agricola spin off it seems, they could have altered it and the game would be the same, just easier to explain.

All in all, many other 2 player games I'd much rather play than this, definitely not agricola 2 player 'lite', but nothing 'broken', so get's a 4 rating, I have no desire to own this.

Components are good but there really isn't a ton in the box for the money. I guess you're paying for the experience! The animeeples are cute though!

Solid worker placement game with the same general theme of its big brother, but much less tension because there is no feeding. 

Moves quick and has a lot of tough choices. At first it doesn't feel like there's enough time to do what you want to do...but that just makes repeated plays and evolving strategies more rewarding. Relatively small footprint is a huge plus

The expansion is pretty much necessary after plays if you want setup variety (which is one of my favorite things in a game). To be honest, it feels like one of the expansions should have been included in the base game. I feel a little cheated when the MSRP of ACBAS and the two expansions is the same MSRP of Agricola.

No one should have the expectation that this would top Agricola. And it doesn't. But it does achieve what it's designed to do.

A tight 30 minute game that has elements reminiscent of Agricola. The fence building, stables, and animal breeding. It's fun as a quick filler for 2.

Had to dock my rating - it turns out the first player has a huge advantage. The game gives you a scoresheet, which is nice, but at play 20 we looked back and realized the player who went first had won 100% of the games. It was often close, but the fact remains the second player had never won. You need some small handicap - one or two wood should probably do it. But once we discovered this it took the air out of the game and we haven't played again since.

If you're familiar with Agricola, pretty much everything in this game will be familiar to you.  You use action spaces to gather resources in order to score points.

However, a lot of the fun of Agricola has been stripped out in this simplified version.  Your focus here is pretty much building pens in order to house animals.  Lots and lots of animals, since that's where the majority of the points will come from.  There's no growing the family, or the tension of feeding your people; mostly just building fences so you can fill your farm with animals, and maybe gathering some resources to build a couple buildings.

Overall, it's a workable, stripped down two-player version, but I'd rather just play Agricola, even if I just had two players.

Patricia liked this game, but she liked its big brother more. "What's the point?" she asked.

When playing the big game, the purpose of the game (in her mind) is to feed your family. :)

We screwed up the scoring on our first game - we missed the rule that you get 1 point per animal. The rulebook's scoring section could be done a lot better.

Simple rules that allow for a fun farm building experience. Best not forget that the game is short and that you are playing against someone, or you may end up short on some needed resources.

Oh yeah, and get as many sheep as you can. Every time I lose it is because I don't have enough sheep.

The expansions turn this very good game, into a great game. Now I just wish they put out a 3-4 player expansion.

RATING: 6
Based on 1 play:

For all its simplicity, Agricola's baby bro here has no less tension. Yeah, you don't have to feed your family, but the pressure of trying to score big and avoid negative points in only 8 turns makes every decision just as stressful and important.

It really is cool that someone managed to strip a worker placement game down to its bare essence and make it play this fast. If that sounds appealing to you, you will probably like this game.

My only legitimate complaint is that there's no random setup element (ala the occupation cards in Agricola). In a two player game, where you're likely playing with the same opponent over and over, it's even MORE important to have some variety in that way. In 3+ game, at least there's more people there to make different moves that affect your play. Here, even though I've only played one game, I could see it becoming scripted quickly.

I understand the expansions address this issue - I'll almost certainly pick one up in the future, as this is a fun game but right now the idea of playing again soon with the same opponent doesn't seem like it would result in a different enough experience.

[u]March 2014:[/u] A nice enough two player game. Unfortunately, the lack of randomizing device means that after 9 plays I feel like the game does not surprise me anymore and plays start feeling scripted. Add in some random bonuses at the start of the game through the use of cards for example would greatly expand the replayability.

All in all, a solid game but that lacks replayability.

RATING: 9
I love Agricola, so this was a must buy! It plays in like 20 minutes, so it's a great way to get your "Agricola fix" if you don't have the time for a full game. 

Of course, it only supports 2 players, and it's a very simple form of Agricola in which some meat has been left out which detracts a bit (although it's of course intentional to have a streamlines/easy version of Agricola which can be played in a fraction of the time), but overall it's pretty great!

Like Agricola, there are so many things you want and need to do, but there are simply not enough actions to do everything - which is something I love! The tension is, however, a bit lower in this game compared to Agricola as you don't have to worry about feeding your family members; that is an aspect I enjoy in Agricola as it makes the game so tense.

There is absolutely no luck in this game - everything is open information which I tend to like. For some, this may lead to AP, though it hasn't been the case when I've played. I can't imagine it is ever going to take more than half an hour, and all in all it's an enjoyable game!

I honestly found this a mediocre to poor game, despite being a huge fan of Agricola. The pieces are nice, and the game well presented, but replay value was low and I was just not enthusiastic, and I play Agricola, La Havre or Gates of Loyang with friends at least twice a week and have for two years, so I am certainly a Uwe Rosenberg fan. I just found it ... lacking.

If you think Agricola is too complex or too long, give this game a try.  It is all of the fun of Agricola in 1/3 the time and with 1/3 the complexity.  I do recommend the expansion, however, as otherwise this becomes an almost-solveable exercise in getting as many animals as possible.

RATING: 8
As a big fan of Agricola, I was very eager to try out this simpler 2p variant of the game. First, some minor negatives of my experience:

No harvest = no pressure. I like the fact that Agricola can make my heart race, especially when I gamble with progressing my plan against risking taking a begging card (which will usually result in a loss). There is non of that in "All Creatures". However, this *is* supposed to be a lighter game, so I can't begrudge the point as much.

Little time to do everything: When I saw the high animal counts on the side of the box, I thought that would be a cinch to get. It wasn't. I feel like I am just getting started when the game ends.

Now - these negatives can actually be positives. My favorite aspect of the game is that it only takes 30 minutes and still remains fun. I love optimization games, and essentially this what this game is. The person who can better optimize given a changing set of inputs will win the game. Since it is so short, you can easily experiment with different strategies and iterate your thoughts very quickly. I very much see this hitting the table often with the wife and I.

A good friend twisted my arm to try this one. I had played Agricola a bit, but it never really clicked with me. I think that's partly because I was always playing it 6+ months apart and against very experienced players. Couple that with a game system that is pretty tough and card play that left me scratching my head, and it always left a bad taste in my mouth.

Stripping out the animal breeding works pretty good. The result is a 30 minute lean two-player worker placement game. I'd be curious if my wife enjoys this.

Update: traded a copy of this game, but I might pick it up again if they release a new version with the expansion buildings added.

RATING: 8
Hard to believe I hadn't played this one as it's always been a highly regarded 2 player game. I enjoyed my play and I am pretty sure we played in about 35-40 minutes which was great. 8 rounds, 24 actions is all you have to build your pastures for all your animals. You definitely need to expand so your animals get bonus points and that is something I need to focus on more in my next game is expanding early and more than just 1 board. I look forward to trying the expansions for the additional buildings to see just how much they may change the strategy from game to game. The only thing I'm not sure of is if my wife would play this. It's light and easy but not the kind of game she typically likes so the actual chance of it being played often is hard to say right now.

Given the opportunity I would rather play the regular version of Agricola (even for 2p).

A nice compact game of animal husbandry.  This would get a higher rating with a little more player interaction to make it meaner.  As it is, the turn countdown (there are only 8 in the game) does give it a nice edge and a sense of urgency.  You certainly can;t waste actions.

What I also enjoy are the multiple paths to victory.  I've seen animal dense feedlots win, I've seen resource hoarders win, and I've seen sprawling ranches win.  It is always encouraging to see this kind of variety in a zero luck game.

When this game entered the market I wasn't really in a mood to play it: its parent game wasn't a smash success with me, and I saw little reason to give the specially adapted 2 player-version a go. (Especially when the parent game plays just fine at 2.) However, my partner indicated she was interested in trying it out just the same, and so when the opportunity presented itself at Spiel 2012, we gave it a try.

The game is basically the livestock-part of the original. Players are still entering a worker placement race with a fixed amount of actions; action fields with resources which have not been taken still get refilled; and there is still both a VP bonus and a malus for having a specific number of animals at the end of the game. However now it is really a race to get as many animals on one's farm, as every animal counts for 1 point. Basic rules are still in place, though one has changed: in order to house animals the pen must be completed prior to introducing animals there.

What has remained is the sometimes harsh player order which sees useful actions being snapped up by the opponent. The problem is now that several actions [i]have[/i] to be taken by both players, and that there seem to be few useful alternatives. Yes, one can invest in buildings or resources for a later round, but that is hardly an interesting 'path to victory', so to speak. It's merely the same path, just delayed and executed with more oompf in which the players hope that they'll make up for the lost turn. Although the game itself plays very quickly, and is very attractive to players looking for a game about animal husbandry without being buried in tons of rules, wood, cards, and cardboard, I supect that it offers very little in the way of decent replayability. And in a darker mood I suspect that is precisely the reason why the expansion was offered, introducing a lot of buildings—all of a sudden there is a truly alternative path to take!

In summary: a nice, friendly game for people looking for a feel of Agricola without the weight. But at the same time not for people who are looking for a lot of replayability.

Przyjemny dwuosobowy fillerek w rozbudowę gospodarstwa. Grę przygotowuje się szybko, a rozgrywka też nie trwa zbyt długo, maksymalnie 30-40 minut. Wymaga starannego planowania i strategii, która zmienia się w minuty na minutę wraz z sytuacją na planszy. Niestety jakoś ta gra mnie w ogóle nie porwała i nie została w kolekcji.

Muy buen juego! consigue reducir el agrícola quitándole lo que más me gusta (plantar y cosechar) pero deja un juego de optimización de espacio y de acciones/recursos muy interesante. Una pequeña joyita de Rosemberg, la verdad es que me ha gustado mucho.
Nota curiosa: Cero azar! El único elemento random que tiene es la elección del jugador inicial; a parte de esa, el juego no tiene ningún factor aleatorio!

A great game for couples and close friends. This is an introduction to Agricola (if you find the game time too long, this is a great alternative!). When people ask me what this game is, I simply say that "It's Farmville on a boardgame". Tons of replay value. Hoping to get the expansion as well!

Components: Colorful, soft art, just like in Agricola. The workers and resources are just plain discs, but the animals are individually shaped.

Experience: I like the emphasis on animals, but miss the special powers (and luck-of-the-draw) from Agricola. I'm not a big fan of games that begin exactly the same each time, with no randomization in the setup. I prefer a game that presents me with a unique challenge on the very first turn.

only complaint is reduced replayability which may be a concern with too many plays. this becomes obsolete with the great expansions and would have led me to a rating of 9 at least.

Pretty minimalistic Agricola: only 8 rounds. A little bit of building, no farming and a lot of animal breeding/herding.

Also lacking occupations and improvements means this game doesn't have the charm, character, replayability or variety of Agricola.

Agriocola: All Creatures Big and Small (A:ACBaS) is a nice and lighter version of Agricola which still manages to keep the basic feel of it's big brother Agricola. In this regard, it's a nice introduction to the full-blown experience of Agricola. While everything but the raising of animals was removed, A:ACBaS still manages to capture the feel of Agricola. I'm mostly using it as a stepping stone to introduce people to it's bigger brother which I do enjoy more. Nevertheless, it's fun to play and I won't turn down a game if it contains at least one of the two available expansions. Just the base game feels a little to restricted to me.

A fine filler, but I'd much rather play a full game of Agricola. I do like having horse meeples though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I understand why this game exists as it does.  In fact, I'm all for a simplified/stripped down version of the game for two people to play rather quickly.  Unfortunately, I think it had a bit too much stripped away.  As it stands now, almost all of the game is deciding which actions you can wait on, and which you have to take right now.  That's fine, as it's a fun element of the base game, but I also really like building up of game engines that function differently from other players' engines by the end of the game.  That's not really possible here.  So I did enjoy the game, but I'd much rather play regular AGricola if that's possible.

Players are farmers, acquiring resources and livestock, and building up a profitable farm.  Lean, punchy two player game where players alternate taking actions to grab stuff off the action board, and wedge it into their farm.  Standard Agricola stuff like wood, stone, reeds and the animals.  No feeding to worry about, and the hundreds of cards are delightfully absent as well.  It's Agricola distilled down to stuffing as many animals as you can into your farm, and hoping you did it better than your opponent.  Twenty minutes of brain burning fun.  Loved it.

Agricola stripped of all the extra bits: only farm animals, no vegetables and no need to feed anyone. The game plays extremely fast and still retains the core of the Agricola experience.

Great game if a little too quick for me but I suppose that is part of the game that you don't have time to do everything you want to build the perfect farm.  Components are great and overall apart from the fact that Horses and Cows were a little hard to tell apart (really should of painted the horses black and the pigs pink).  The wife enjoyed it as well so can't complain (think she just loved the animeeples).

Quick and fun meat-only take on the Agricola theme. Surprisingly replayable, given that the initial set-up and subsequent resources inputs are the same each time.

RATING: 7
All Creatures Big and Small is a small 2-player version of Agricola that plays relatively quickly and focuses on animals and pastures. The game removes the feeding portion of the game, as well as plowing/sowing. Some people will see this as a great thing (myself included) because feeding your people is a stressful aspect of Agricola. in addition, you can't grow your family in ACBAS. Each player gets 3 workers and no more additional workers can be attained. I like this as I felt like the person that can grow their family first has the best chance at winning in Agrciola, as long as they didn't get a begging card in the process. The base game is a perfect information game that can be literally played the exact same way, if your opponent were to allow it. This can lead to scripted moves in the first round or two in the game, which is certainly a negative thing. 

A lot of people consider at least one of the two expansions to be necessary to own, if you're going to get this game. Each of these expansions include 27 special buildings. You don't need to get one expansion before the other either. The base game includes 4 of which you'll use every game. When using the expansion, the game still is perfect information, but it will shake up beginning moves, because not only will you have the normal 4, but an additional 4 - 8 special buildings that can change people's strategies. Assuming you get an expansion with the base game, ACBAS is a fine entry into the Uwe Rosenberg farming line. If you can't get an expansion, get a different 2-player game.

Initially really enjoyed this for the quick play, and the amount of strategy squeezed into 30 minutes. But, it really needs the cards for me. Some kind of simplified card system might have been in order.

RATING: 10
Fun for two, but gets repetitive after a couple of games. It really needs the expansions with more special buildings. Quite irritating that there is only 4, no reason there couldn´t have been more to begin with.

Update: This game is way overpriced. The basegame is 39€ + the mandatory expansions are 13€/piece = 65€!!
You can get Caverna, which has ten times the material, for 69€...

But still, I highly recommend.

That awesome Agricola lite was a must-have! And it's true factory farming there, piles of lambs look always gorgeous. But one thing I miss from the original Agricola: I would like to slaughter animals and eat them..! That's strange because I don't eat animals in real life... board games seem to awake some ancient carnivoristic tendencies in me =P

RATING: 9
Very engaging design and production. Plays rapidly but provides much to pleasantly ponder. Often results in "let's play it again..and again". Has quickly moved way up on our list of favorites! The theme is great and the sim-intimacy of working a small family farm is very well expressed. Animal husbandry in a neat small box!

RATING: 7.5
Fun little game with interesting strategy decisions rooted in simple rules. Excellent physical quality (love those animeeples), though boards are a bit cramped -- I would have preferred bigger boards, though the consequences be a bigger box and higher price tag. The multitude of little bits reduces the utility of the game for travelers or pub players. Also a good light Euro gateway game. Recommended.

RATING: 3
Without the 'More Buildings' expansions this is one of the least replayable experiences available; surpassing Smallworld's 'Tales & Legends' as the world's most imperative expansion. I find the animal management aspect of Agricola very interesting, but it fails to interest me as a standalone. Maybe its because you can't turn them into food, and instead struggle to build enough fences. Despite its shorter length and its lighter feel, I'd prefer 2p Agricola nearly 100% of the time.

RATING: 6
Played once.  It was pretty good, but I felt that most of the games would play out the same, and that there wasn't a lot of variety in the game.  Glad to find out that there's an expansion; I think that would improve the re-playability and variety greatly.

MAY/14 - Hmm. Well...I played with an expansion for my first game and quite liked the game. Played my second game with just the base set and found it very dull. So now it's a $50+ game (base + exp).

I like the idea of the game, I really want a bite-sized Agricola, and I find this fairly fun, but I do find the easyness of animal breeding to be a bit dull. I don't like having dozens of wooden animals crammed onto a few tinyy squares. In that sense, I wish the game was a bit harder.

AUG/14 - Found this game uninteresting on the third play. If Agricola is a root beer float, All Creatures is like flat root beer.

Agricola boiled down to two players, just animal husbandry, and 20 minutes of playtime (add to that a much reduced setup time).

Even though ACBaS gets rid of one of the defining elements of Agricola, the feeding phase, it still feels remarkably close to its origin. You still get too little of everything, and with the shrunken scope and playing field the dance for the right action spaces is as interesting as ever.

One major difference to Agricola, however, is that ACBaS is entirely deterministic. There is not a single random element to mix things up once in a while. That is not a problem for the first few plays, but I would expect the game to become stale and scripted rather quickly going forward. Luckily, there is an expansion waiting in the wings. Honi soit qui mal y pense.

Really great two player, smaller version of Agricola. Many paths to victory, especially when adding the expansion buildings, so the replayability is huge. Gameplay is great; each turn there's always going to be more you want to do than the number of actions you have, so each one feels really important, however it's not so unforgiving that you can't recover from one or two bad actions. Will be a favorite for a long time to come!

This is a pleasant game and a rather good distillation of some of the core mechanics from Agricola. This one is definitely lighter and tighter, but quite a bit less punishing then its parent game. I think it's quite a nice diversion and while it may lack the meatiness of a fuller game I could see myself playing this casually. Its replay value is quite limited, but fortunately the expansions help give this one more variety. I couldn't imagine playing without the expansions and it was a little cheap to not include them in the original game. It's one of those few games where the expansion honestly "completes" the game and keeping them separate feels like you were sold 3/4 of a game the first time around.

We also own both Expansion - "More Buildings" and "Even More Buildings".  All boxes tossed - this is a keeper.

It is not Agricola-lite. It is Caverna-lite, with both players optimizing the special buildings that they choose to build in order to succeed. 

My bet is that Uwe's design progression went: "Agricola" --> "Agricola: ACGaS" --> "Caverna".


It's more like Caverna because all of the special buildings are available to either player, unlike Agricola where you have an exclusive secret set that are available only to you (your hand-cards). This adds a layer of tension, because your opponent may build something that you had planned to build, thus denying it to you (all special buildings are unique).

Half the game is denial. Watching your opponents progress and foiling it with your own placements and purchases.Thus, there is more player interaction than the bigger games, probably because there only two players and any choice you make is zero-sum.

The expansions simply add more special building choices. We draw 6* special buildings per game (of which there are 30 or 40 with all the expansions) and it makes each game a different challenge. 

If you are like us - preferring smaller, shorter games with similar depth to "big games", Agricola: ACGaS is for you!



* the rules tell you to draw 4. 6 is better - more chances for cool synergies to pop up.

Agricola: ACBaS is a very easy game to teach and play. It plays very fast, has tight mechanics and a good amount of choices. I like that there is open information, no luck, many paths to victory, and I like how relaxed the gameplay is compared to regular Agricola. I was also surprised, but not bothered, that the omission of the family and feeding mechanisms from Agricola takes away from the theme and makes ACBaS really feel more like an abstract game than anything.

As much as I don't like Agricola I enjoyed its simplified version. It has some depth, some decisions and yet it's compact in terms of both setup and playing time. Of course it's nothing even remotely so complicated as the original which doesn't bother me at all :-)

A worker placement German style board game tailor-made for two? Yes please and thank you. I was always intimidated by Agricola and now I know why. I did horribly on this simpler, streamlined version. Apparently I suck at running a farm. I still enjoyed creating one and the competition for resources. AACGaS is a winner even if it makes me a loser.

It is original Agricola that plays in about 45 minutes.  The base game does not have a ton of replay value due to the limited amount of special building tiles, but they seem to have alleviated this issue with the creation of two expansions containing 27 special buildings each.  My rating may go up after playing with them.

Nice game, however not near as good as Agricola. The problem in this game is where to store all those animal meeples - boards are too small for that.

I have found that this gives me much of the experience of playing Agricola without the same investment in time. 

Additionally, being blocked out of an action in ACGaS is not nearly as painful as it is in Agricola. And I don't mind not having to get food for my family as well. The unique buildings from the expansion spice the game up in the same way that the cards do in Agricola, so I don't even miss that. This will get many more plays than Agricola will.

RATING: 5
Agricola for 2 player only but also very light.
Fewer different resources, no feeding, only one upgrade for your shed and house. With all they left away the only thing they added is horses (means 4 different animals to take care of). There are two spaces for wood and two for stone. If one player takes one space so you take the other. All in all too simplicistic. I don't understand this trend to simplify a game until there are only bones...
If a painter would leave away all colors to claim that you now better see the canvas, there must be something wrong with art.

As a sandbox efficiency puzzle, it does it job well enough. With only two players, there is slightly more interaction than other Rosenberg games because it is easy to follow what your opponent is collecting. It is still minor, however, but a player's actions will have somewhat of an impact on the other's. What this game brings is an easy-going joy of farm building. With no need to feed farmers, the puzzle is about planning your space and encouraging your animals to grow. This is a comfortable game that has the pleasant feel of an old favorite.

This is supposed to be a quick and simple two-player alternative to "Agricola", but even without having ever played the original, I still thought the game lacked something. The choices aren't very tense or interesting. There are two spots for each type of resource on the main board, and if your opponent takes a resource you want, you may always take the other spot. One player focuses on getting horses, the other gets cows. There are very few types of buildings and they are nothing special. Despite making thematic sense, the gameplay feels quite abstract, and the unnecessarily clunky scoring - with a table on the side of the box! - is another negative point.

The production is flawed, too, with small boards and big player pieces. Maybe the annoyingly large discs were supposed to have stickers but someone decided to cut costs in the last minute. At least they included "animeeples", but there aren't enough of them, and cardboard tokens are inelegantly used when necessary. The only thing they did right was the box size, so that it stacks perfectly with the (generally better) games from the Kosmos two-player series.

All in all, I had a just average and slightly boring experience. I might give it a second chance, but I'm happy that I could play a friend's copy and save my money.

"Agricola" couldn't convince me and this one didn't do a better job. The only interaction comes from blocking spaces and there isn't much to explore. Just get as many animals as possible. The few special building arn't really special and will be boring after a few plays.

In short, there are MUCH better 2 player games out there.

Downsizing Agricola,  I would have like a change in the scoring system which is as contrived as in the parent game, because.... what's the point?  I already play the 2 players Agricola, without cards, with or without the extension, so what's the point of this version, which is surely less "complex" than agricola, but shaves off not only many rules but most of the fun and tactical variation?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun little miniature version of Agricola. The short time length and the reduced field of consideration (i.e., primarily animal husbandry and a bit of construction; none of the field-labouring, and occupation-based bonuses) should make for a lighter game of Agricola for two. However, since the game is perfect information (gone is the variable 'what comes next' cards, as well as occupations and minor improvements), if players are (very) not evenly matched (in terms of calculating advantages of actions, implicitly or explicitly), the conclusion won't be a surprise at the end of the match (first player advantage can mitigate some of this). Nonetheless, great design with loads of viable strategies (especially when you throw in the expansion(s)).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of my favorite 2-player games.   Having never played Agricola I can't compare it.  

The game plays quickly and smoothly.  There are just enough choices to give each player a different path, but not enough to make players feel lost.

For experienced players there are multiple good strategies and counter play to be had.  Playing regularly with my wife we can quickly intercept and interact with each others plan. And even when one player makes a move to directly block the other's progress; it only lasts for that turn and the blocked player still has options.

This is a Mini 2 player version of Agricola.

ACTIONS (each player has pnly 3 workers and there are no ways of obtaining extra meeples)

1 - COllect wood x3
2 - Collect x1 wood and be first player
3 - Collect x2 ore
4 - collect x1 ore
(amount of resources from above will stack)
5 - collect 1x wood 1x ore 1x reed
6 - collect 2x fence + X fence (X = additional fence for each 2 ore you give)
7 - pay X wood to get X fence
(when you play 6 or 7, place fence on your game board or keep them. You may only place fence from these 2 options)
8 - Collect x1 fence + Extension board
(fence will stack)
9 - Build shack
10 - Build special buildings
11-14 - take animals on board
(animal varies and will stack if no one takes them)

As usual, if you place a worker piece on any available actions, you get all the stacked pieces. Oh yeah, don't forget, animal breeds too, but you only get 1 extra animal and not for each pair!

One of my favorite two player games ! Highly recommended for two players and even kids pick up this game really fast

Agricola két személyes kis dobozos játéka. Nekem és a páromnak nagyon tetszik. Nincs benne etetés, hanem az állatok gyűjtésére van kihegyezve. Jól kell kihasználni az épületeket. Sok játék után persze kevés az a változatosság, amit az épületek adnak, ezért célszerű legalább egy kiegészítő beszerzése. 

Szöveg van az épület kártyákon, de mivel azok ki vannak rakva, ezért könnyű azokat a szabály alapján értelmezni, tehát nem kell megijedni a nyelvfüggőségétől.

I did not dislike agricola, there were certainly parts of the game that captured my attention and made me want to play it. Now they made this 2-player version and got rid of all the things I didn't like so much (the cards/food/stress) and kept all the fun in a little box :D What's not to like !

Competent lightweight facsimile of Agricola for two.  Decent in a pinch when it's too impractical to lug the full game around or time is short, but there's definitely something missing.  ACB&S lacks the hard choices - there are good choices, and there are better choices, but there aren't any [i]hard[/i] choices.  I'm glad this game exists, and I see myself playing it again, but I won't run to it the first chance I get.

I love this game.  Its nearest to Chess in it's reduction of luck in the equation when reaching an outcome.  Even the "who goes first?" is well negated with the mechanic. I've been playing this game for 2-3 years now, and although other games have certainly been enjoyed as well, I can still replay this, have a different game every time, and get a great mental workout.

I still can't beat my husband at Agricola, even in this two player version where you don't need to worry about feeding the family.  I love the wooden animals that come with this game and it is nice to have an Agricola that plays in 30 min.  It is also a lot simpler than regular Agricola due to the lack of the cards.  I did like the game and look forward to trying it again.  I'm interested in the new buildings in the expansions, when we get to that point.

I really love this stripped down take on Agricola. It's simple, elegant and fun, while still tight and competitive.  At the end of the game you smile and think 'what a nice farm I've built, look at all the animals, rather than 'Phew, we didn't starve to death, and I have one cow.'

It is a good and simple version of Agricola for 2 players. Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small is condensed into stock farm management. The game takes about 30 minuetes. Comparing with original Agricola, the game provide easier rule and fewer tactical options. This game is going to be a good guide to Agricola for someone who feel tough on the original game. Right after players get used to the game mechanic, people would prefer Agricoal to A:ACB&S. If someone give me a choice to choose, I would rather play Agricola original. For two players, Agricola takes less than an hour. Even though I agree A:ACB&S is a good guide to Agricola, for this reason, I would rather choose Agricola instead of All Creatures Big and Small for fully enjoying the farming game.

I really enjoy playing this game. Every game feels tense, competitive and comes right down to every action being important. And it plays so quickly that multiple games are almost always warranted. I like that it has strategic depth while being fairly quick and casual. There's something strangely hypnotic about trying to build up your farm and feeling like there isn't enough time to get it done. In the end you almost always end up with a pretty decent result and feel mystified as to how it was possible given the constraints. This is both highly satisfying in seeing the fruits of your stress in the completed game as well as motivational for improving on further plays. 

Solid game!

Who is searching for the experience of Agricola will be disappointed, but if you are searching for a nice game which has the same feel this will definitely hit the right spot. 

Rules are easy to grab and the games plays quite fast (i suppose slightly above 20 minutes if both players know what they are doing).

I only own the base game but I haven't grown tired of the 4 basic buildings and relative opportunities. 

Definitely a keeper.

Great little 2 player only version of the Gric that plays in 25 - 30 mins flat which is great and about half as long as base game and much less set-up/tear down as well (by the time you set that regular monster up/put away, draft cards, etc). 

Definitely needs expansion buildings included for serious players as it opens up options a little and increases the replay by 100% or more. I had ideas on how to beef it up a little before playing thinking it might be too light, but now I'm not sure it needs it. 

I held off on this for a long time just because it seems like dumbed down version (it is) that isn't so different from the family game in regular Gric AND the replay value with just this game alone and no expansion was quite limited. Expansion fixes replay and even adds to the meat here so likely to pick it up now

Smaller and more focused version of [b][thing=31260]Agricola[/thing][/b] that has a higher fun factor. Play time for the first few games was close to 1 hour, but has now settled right around 1/2 hour.

The game is cool for how you sort of build up your little structure of expanding your farm, and then you get it going and start building up your farm and before you might get bored it's done.  This game is really streamlined, but ends up being maybe *too* streamlined.  Specifically, the games end up feeling very similar and almost like you are playing the same game over, without a lot of complexity opening up.  Also, the outcome of the game often isn't really a nailbiter.

Also, if you play the app, even the hardest level of the AI isn't that good, so you may be able to decisively beat it on the first go.  The game is fully deterministic, so it doesn't have any real replay value after that.  The app does have cute animations of the sheep and such, so it is pretty to look at and good for pass-and-play.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (August 2015)

I LOVE Agricola, so I was keen on trying the 2 player edition of the game. Our play was pleasant enough but it didn´t offer what I was looking for so I don’t like the game. 

This edition of the game removed everything I loved about Agricola, now there is no tension (you don’t need to feed anyone), it is static (always the same setup and buildings, there are no cards) and it is a dumbed down version of Agricola (everything is a lot easier here).

Due to the static setup, it always will play the same way. Variability is only provided by the players. This is very negative for me. It also means it has a very low replayability factor (like Caverna but much worse because here there are too few buildings). I can see the same strategies being played every time. It sorely needs an expansion.

The bonus points are only found on the box, I would have liked to have a player aid for this, but this is a minor quibble.

If the idea was to make a 2 player version of Agricola, it failed miserably, besides 2 player Agricola is great as it is so it wasn’t needed in the first place. If the idea was to make a dumbed down version of Agricola it succeeded. I concede it can be a good family or introductory game (perhaps my mom would play it with me) but it is definitively not for me.

Among its virtues, the art an components are very good. It plays VERY fast and it is very easy to learn.

Bottom line, I don’t like the game, it is way too light and gentle for my tastes and it removed everything fun from Agricola. I won’t buy it.

A simpler Agricola. This game is more accessible, less punishing, and plays faster than its older sibling. However, with the streamlining of rules and actions, the game is less challenging and does not do enough to satisfy. Kinda like an appetiser to Agricola's half-pound cheeseburger. Except the cheeseburger is marinated in cheap vinegar and loaded with cavier, raw mutton, crusty bread and sawdust.

A mini version of my favourite, Agricola. This lighter version for two players only sees the players only worrying about animal husbandry.

Impressive 2-player implementation of Agricola. It does away with the cards and creates variation by adding four randomized buildings (tiles) that you can purchase and place each game. It also does away with the farms and focuses on pastures and animal husbandry exclusively. You basically try to breed as many animals of as many different types as possible in 8 turns. Great, thoughtful, two-player game.

Like Agricola, it makes me feel like resolving a math exercise.

Only thing is, you need at least one if not both expansions to get the needed depth and replayability.

RATING: 8
I think this is a nice two-player game with some interesting decisions and management of several resources. Although it has the Agricola moniker it is not great for the same reasons Agricola is great. I could see hard-core Agricola fans, especially those that can knock out a two-player game in ~1hour, not really having a use for this simplified version.

Of note we have no family growth or harvest in AaCBaS except for the breeding phase. Animals are only used as a set collection mechanic you can not convert them to food, indeed, there is no food at all. So the engine building of Agricola is not here which is really at the heart of the game.

This is not a slight to AaCBaS, just a fact to help understand how different the two games are. There are many aspects of Agricola in AaCBaS. The way resources pile up between rounds, building fences to store animals, points from buildings (although in Agricola they were major improvements), and worker placement. These mechanics work very well here and create a tense action-limited game of resource management and set collection.

One thing that kind of annoys me is that this is a two-player only game. There is no real reason for this limitation except for lack of game boards for more players similar to the scaling needed in Agricola. The base mechanics, like in Agricola, work very well for two but why not include more? The best two-player games don't just work at two they require two as any more would ruin the game, this is true of many of the great Kosmos two-player games. Again, this isn't a major complaint it says two-players right on the box and it works wonderfully with two.

On the whole I'm very happy to own this, I can see using it as a primer to Agricola and as a nice small version I can bring to a coffee shop. It does play faster than Agricola so it's also useful for that reason.

Agricola on a diet! 

Very neat slimmed down version of a great game. 
Still maintains the difficult decision choices 
at less than half the time commitment.

Super!

RATING: 8
A very interesting stripped down version of Agricola that offers much of the same feeling in a reduced play time. Since I usually ignore animals until later in the game, it's fun to have so many animals, and the abundance of resources in the game provides storage problems that I don't usually encounter in Agricola.

It is fun to play and enjoyable, though certainly derivative and I would say unnecessary if you already own Agricola. If both people know what they're doing, playing Agricola doesn't take too much longer, and offers a deeper experience. I think that this would be a good way to introduce the system to kids, though.

Agricola stripped of all the complex scoring and upkeep phases. This game becomes a little bit more of a generic worker placement, but it is easier to play. There is a lot less tenseness because every action seems to have some merit (so you can't get screwed by making suboptimal choices).

The thing that strikes me the most is that it is extremely overproduced for such a simple and light game.

This may not appeal to some Agricola fans because of the relative lightness, but it distills the parts of Agricola I like without the bits that, for me, bog it down. Agricola is a great game, but it's just not my cup of tea. All Creatures Big and Small has what I like about it - the worker placement, the spatial planning, and the theme - without the bits that turn me off.

Definitely get the expansions, as they add a bit of variety that keep the game going after repeated plays.

RATING: 7.5
I rather dislike Agricola, but this takes the theme and focuses on the more spatial/timing puzzle of fencing and animal care. Making the buildings be free fences makes for intriguing decisions at points: do I fence it off, or what 'till I put a building there? 

I'd say however that if you play this more than a handful of times, you'll need one of the two expansions, or games get samey fast.

Nie mam odniesienia do oryginalnej Agricoli ale wersje 2osobowa bardo lubie. Niestety gramy w nią zdecydowanie mniej niż bym chcial. Dużo drewienek cieszy oko, bardzo podoba mi się mechanika ograniczając losowosc praktycznie do zera. Niestety cierpi na tym regrywalnosc, gdyż początkowy setup wygląda zawsze tak samo. Jeśli uda mi się przeforsować częstsze pojawianie się tego tytułu na stole to na pewno dokupie dodatek.

Great worker placement game for 2 players!

Breeding being limited to 1 new animal per type is thematically broken.

This needs 1 of the expansions to be non-deterministic.

RATING: 8.5
This game has just about as many moving parts I want in an Agricola game, delivering the joy of the game with much less of the sorrow and stress.  It's a real joy to play.

The only doubt I have about it is that the game almost seems a little too non-confrontational (despite being a 2 player game)?  That's eurogames, I suppose.

RATING: 8
This is a wonderful game and one of the best introductions to worker placement for casual gamers. It is much easier to learn, and more fun to play, than full-blown Agricola. It travels well and you can easily play it in a bar, hotel, or restaurant. I recommend getting one of the expansions for more replayability, though I'm not sure you need both.

Agricola light. Takes away all of the clunky aspects about Agricola and streamlines them. I feel that Uwe has perfected his system over the continuous tweaking seen throughout Le Havre and Ore Et Labora as of late. However, this game just loses too much of the intimacy that Agricola does thematically. No longer do you have to feed and grow your family. Taking you out of that thematic element makes this game a lesser offering.

Game is very durable. Icons and pieces very intuitive. A pig looks like a pig, a fence looks like a fence etc. Colorful and innocent-looking.

-1 for nobody expressed that they had fun afterward,
-1 for too complicated rules
-1 for too artificially complicated gameplay.  it is very linear, nothing changes, it feels too much like a sudoku fitting all the animals.
-1 for no randomness at all, it's more of a simulation.
-1 for too slippery board pieces
-1 for bland design and place holders for 4+ animals, sheep don't fit.

It is very good that it is out of print and it should stay that way. I am willing to part with my specimen at any price and good riddance. We played once, scored 40 points each, and it just is so meh - I never liked agri the full game either, watching paint dry is more spectacular.

Even if the playing time is 45 minutes (instead of the 30 on the box) this is an absolute musthave .

Update.
Well I wish I would have used this money to save up for caverna.

The game works but it removes the feeding, and because both players have to approach the game in a similar manner it is very scripted.
Playing time is indeed 30 minutes because most options are straightforward.
Agricola works well with two players and is far superior to this spin off

Get the expansion if you are purchasing this game.  The expansion increases the rating to a 7 as it will change the game strategy with the different buildings.  The base game will get stale with the same buildings all the time.  Tiebreaker is LAME - c'mon, the player who wasn't the start player to begin the game wins ties?  Really?  Plays very quickly and one does not have the agony of having to feed one's family - this is just straight up harvesting wood, stone and reed to construct special buildings/stables or fences to contain as many animals as possible in 9 rounds of play.

Ein reines 2-Spieler Worker-Placement Spiel.
Nach Arbeiter-Einsetz Manier erhält man Ressourcen (Holz, Stein, Schilf) oder baut damit Weiden, Gebäude die Sondereigenschaften besitzen oder Futtertröge, die man wiederrum braucht um auf einem weiteren Arbeiterfeld angesammelte Tiere zu nehmen und unterzubringen, die Schlussendlich die Siegpunkte generieren. Nach 8 Runden ist das Spiel auch schon vorbei und es wird geschaut wer denn nun am meissten Tiere anhäufen konnte.
Ich finde es einfach klasse das Spiel. Es hat mit dem großen Agricola weniger zu tun, aber das Gefühl von "Ich brauche 5 Aktionen, habe aber nur 3" und die daraus resultierende Entscheidung was ich dann nehme und was mir mein Gegner weg nimmt empfinde ich großartig. Eine viel bessere Umsetzung wie z.B. das Caverna-für-2 Spiel, das ich auch hatte.

RATING: 6
Addresses my complaint about Agricola (namely that the depth & replayability comes from a vast array of variable items/powers that interact in complex ways) by having a more fixed universe of play, but I suspect this means that the game will become rather 'fixed' after repeated plays.

What is a game I can play when I am in the mood for Agricola, only have two players, and want a game that takes less than an hour? Hmmm...All Creatures Big and Small! This game is perfect for introducing someone to the game of Agricola. This game is much simpler because of the elimination of cards (occupations and improvements) but still feels like you are playing Agricola. The only problem with the game is that it has been out of print for a while...

I like this much more than Agricola.  No need to feed your people, you are strictly growing your farm.  This makes the game experience more positive and less stressful.  Another positive difference from Agricola for our tastes is that this has no cards, and thus is a perfect information game.   I rate this as an 8 versus other 2 player games.

RATING: 5
I always wish that games have variable setup (interestingly enough unlike its predecessor it goes from much variable setup to none), but this is a quick, easy to learn 2 player game that has a decent amount of depth. I don't enjoy it as much as LOTR: Card Game which I traded to get this, but A:ACBS will definitely get more plays. The worker spaces while being numerous still feel like you can block off your opponent a bit, and the constantly refilling resources means which spots are strong changes from round to round. Rulebook is a bit of a mess. The animal pieces are really nice but at least in my copy some of the wooden discs are really misshapen.

RATING: 8
Excellent two player game that gives the feel of Agricola without a lot of the complexity.  I really love this little game.  There is no feeding and you are trying to maximize the number of animals you have in your farm.  It brings in buildings like Caverna, and with the expansions it is brilliant.  There are an infinite number of ways to play with new buildings.  

I cannot get my wife to play Agricola but she loves this little game.

Nice feeling of agricola, but not quiet the real thing
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Streamlined Agricola--animals only.  Still worker placement, so not my favorite kind of game.  Seems like it needs more choices out of the box.  The expansion supposedly helps, but with the cost of the original, it hardly seems like you should need to purchase an expansion.  I felt like I could virtually plan a game out ahead of time, with only 8 turns and 24 total workers placed.  There was very little interference between players, but likely the choices become more difficult as tactics are developed.  I probably will not find out as I turn to the many other choices for two-player games.

My wife and I were looking for [b][thing=31260][/thing]-lite[/b], which this is.  It fits pretty much what we wanted in terms of speed to set up and quickness to play.  However, it's just too light.  And without the added tension of having to feed your farmers, it just fell flat for us.  I hear the expansions make it a better experience, but I'm not convinced it'd be money well spent.  For the price of two expansions, I could probably buy another full game that's more to our liking.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The base game has no variability in set up and thus each game can be pretty much the same. I missed out on the expansions and that's a shame because the base alone isn't enough anymore.

RATING: 7
As a shorter version of Agricola, this does a pretty good job. It still features some of the agonising decisions that are the hallmark of Agricola, but in a shorter play time.

As a lighter version of Agricola, well... not really. There are fewer actions to be taken than in Agricola, and timing is as important as ever, so it's still a difficult game. I'm not sure I'd use it as an intro to Agricola. For learning from a rulebook, Agricola is better as there is a solo variant to practise with, and for teaching, I'd say it's better to play the big game and just guide players through their first game.

For me, this was bought so that my wife and I could get a more frequent Agricola fix, since play time and set-up time are factors with our small kids. This has been a successful purchase in that regard.

I wonder though, whether this game will have the same longevity as its big brother. There is no randomness at all to the set-up of this game, so I suspect that after a couple of games with the same players, a routine strategy will begin to set in and the game will become somewhat scripted. I hope this is not the case and that this will hold up to 200+ plays in the same way that San Juan and Thurn & Taxis have for my wife and I, but time will tell.

[Played 3 times]

Simple and fast, it features minimal interaction (too many spaces, including several redundant effects, to be able to meaningfully "block" the opponent).
Deterministic, with no variance in the setup and limited options, it seems a tad too easy to "fully explore".
Innocuous.

RATING: 9
All the fun and tension of a deeper Uwe game like Agricola or Caverna with much less playtime/setup.  Also, this game is far more accessible to players who aren't into deeper games.  All Creatures, especially with both expansions, is a deceptively deep and meaty game.  The theme is adorable and wife-approved.  Which is nice because our games are generally confined to Patchwork, Love Letter, Rattlebones, etc.

This game slightly scratches the itch to play Agricola. Being a two player game, I would prefer to play THIS over the mother ship head-to-head. It also is a game that my wife can beat me at, which is a rare plus.  It became very chess-like until I had a friend with a great printer make me the expansions which now makes each game have just enough variety that it remains fun.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Plays fast, has tight rules, and cute animeeples. It's excellent for couples. The game forces you to constantly prioritize having a more efficient farm layout or getting more animals. You get the fun of playing Agricola, with one third the game length, and a fraction of the time it takes for setup and tear down.

Anticipating this to bump a point with the expansion.

05/15/13: Finally got around to playing with expansion. The new buildings make the much game more interesting. Before this expansion, the game was getting scripted and feeling redundant.

Cute little game. Remarkable how one aspect of Agricola was isolated, and used as the basis for this game.

Runaway leader)

Many more unrecorded plays.

+More Buildings expansion a necessity.  My rating is with this first expansion.

+/- Even More Buildings is very cool but adds a lot of pieces with lots of text even though this second expansion makes new strategies viable and its rule changes add many more buildings to the building offer.

RATING: 7
I was pretty sceptic about this Agricola remix after reading the rules, since I did not see what would prevent it from getting stale after a few plays. And even after more than a hundred plays, we’re nowhere near to getting tired of Agricola itself, and at least our two player games are usually concluded within an hour. Including setup.

Actually trying the game when a friend wanted to give his new copy a spin was a pleasant surprise. Admittedly, the plan to add the first expansion right after our first game helped a lot to lure me in, but I think that I can see how even the base game with its paltry 4 special buildings can offer quite a bit of variety. Which I’ll never explore, since if I were to play again or even purchase it, I’d certainly use the expansion, and the whole package would get a rating of 8.

One of my favorite 2-player games. Lindsey and I have played it a handful of times, and I have played it several more times with others. A "must-have" for any 2-player collection.

The expansions are necessary for replayability (disclaimer: I have not played the expansions), as the base game does feel repetitive after a dozen plays--even though each game plays out differently with differing strategies.

1-25-14-took awhile but i finally came to realize that we do not enjoy static games so much.  if there's no tactical side to the game it doesn't have that fun factor for us.  Even the introduction of the expansion has not infused anything of interest so it will hopefully go to a home where it is appreciated.  

9-16-12-This is one of those games that is simple to learn, easy to play, with multiple choices--but you can never do everything you want to do!  Fun, quick, interesting.

Man this is a good game. It's satisfying, so short you always feel like you can't do everything you wanted to, and packs considerable depth and variety into a small package. The first time out, we played it three times in a row, and each time I discovered something new to try. I see plenty more to discover, too.

It doesn't feel like filler, though the length is filleresque. It's super-cute, and I like the mix of doing your own thing and having to keep tabs on your opponent and block them appropriately. The worker placement element is well-implemented, and all of the choices on the board have value in different situations.

It also works well with a wide variety of folks -- everyone I've played it with, including non-gamers, has enjoyed it.

At first I thought it's stupid idea to make more abstract 2p version from a game that's already great 2p game, and good because it ISN'T abstract, but now I think it's pleasant one. Without the expansion it's only fun for game or two though. With the expansion it's a good way to get Agricola fix in 2x less playtime and 3x less setup. Probably good gateway to big Agricola too? BUT the 'story' is nowhere as immersive - you still have nice familiar meeples, but you're just building random barns and stuff.

The game is quick and fast. It's nice to see your and your opponent's farm grow. And the times we played it, the farms turned out different each time. I can imagine that if you remember all the steps to gaining a high score and your opponent doesn't obstruct those steps, you could win each time. I foresee in the long run that the expansion is necessary. Hopefully 999 Games brings out the Dutch expansions.

My wife likes it, but not as much as 7 Wonders and not even as much as the Catan Card Game. I think she also likes a bit more randomness in a game. This is, by the way, the game where she promised me she will play a bit more boardgames with me, just to keep me away from the computer screen and her from the TV screen. ;)

First play left us a little overwhelmed and not entirely satisfied. It increased the general feeling I got from playing the IOS version that we might not enjoy full-blown Gric' all that much. I'm glad that we can dip our toes in a little bit more with this version before deciding to eventually buy the mothership.

Sold July 2015 for seeing too little table time.

RATING: 7.5
Rating based on plays w/expansion.

The best thing that this game has going for it is the game's quick play time.  Agricola in 45 minutes, including setup?  Awesome.  It doesn't have near the decision tree, however, and the game isn't as stress inducing as Agricola (which I enjoy).  The expansion helps keep the game fresh enough, but it still plays out someone similar each time.

Decent game.

From my wonderful 2013 BGG Secret Santa. 
The best way to describe this game is the tightly balanced duel of something like RftG meets the options and general strategy of a harvest trilogy worker placement. The game is very slick once you mount the "making it work" phase and get to the "tuning" phase, especially with the expansion buildings.  I like the game well enough without them (rated an 8), but with them included the game (takes it to 9) has a whole new charm as an ever changing puzzle that is fun enough on one side of the table but becomes very competitive when the person across the table reminds you they are there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A shorter, lighter, two-player Agricola spinoff.  Not as deep, varied (or good) as its ancestor, but still enjoyable.  Works well if you have only a short play-time window or if you want a lighter game.  Works well as a game to play with my son.

I think it might get dry after several plays because, compared with Agricola, there is not as much variability and not as depth to explore.

Great game, with a lot of theme and really interesting. There is a lot of strategy though there is my biggest complain of the game: once u developed the better one for you, all games against same oponent are kind of the same. Still an incredible game I enjoy a lot.

Pretty good little game. I might like it better if not for the name; every time I see it, I'm reminded of how much I like the REAL Agricola, which makes me want to play that instead. If this had a different name, it would probably be an 8 or higher.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I am not a big Agricola fan, but this seemed like it would have a much friendlier feel to it.  I do enjoy it and appreciate how quick it plays while still providing a nice, tactical placement game.  I rarely get to play two-player games so it likely won't see much play overall, but I'm generally happy with what it does.  However, there's nothing overly special or unique about it, and in the same niche I would probably lean towards Targi.

I like this quite a bit more than the original.  You can accomplish quite a bit more in this quick little 2 player game, than in the larger 4 player game.  Just writing this makes me want to break it out and play it again as its been a while.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fun, quick and a lot harder than I thought it would be. I find it hard to balance my actions in this game, which is a good thing because it means that I won't tire of it quickly.

This fills the slot of a more advanced "Patchwork" (also by Uwe), but is less interactive (because the optimisation is at the forefront, while I find Patchwork to have more intentional screwage). I suspect this is why I'm no good at it, I want to ruin the plans of my opponent, but the three workers a turn means you have to prioritize your own farm ahead of screwing theirs (though, when things overlap it's very fun to watch their plans fall apart).

I have the expansion, and while it keeps the game from getting similar, it is also a factor in keeping screwage down, as the paths to victory are more distinct, both players diverge to a greater extent and you don't follow the same pattern from game to game but instead try to optimise for the set of buildings available.

I like it despite the lack of direct screwage (mostly because it is a 2-player game, which I play in a context where less rather than more screwage is better) and think it's rather good. As a puzzle it is certainly rather tricky - calculating and figuring out the optimal placements of both workers and your farm buildings / fences.

There is also something to be said for the way things unfold on your board. You certainly build your own farm and it's fun to watch things emerge different from game to game. Your horse ranch with a large sheep pasture, to a more "balanced" farm with all kinds, or a farm devoid of animals but filled with all sorts of buildings (that one didn't win). 

A good game!

Basically mini-Agricola (without the feeding) that focuses more on the farming aspect and building tiles.  You like animals then you bought the right game, the whole game is get the most animals and fill out your board(but the game is only 8 rounds)... and it's still a fun worker placement.  Great fun filler! 2p only game!

This game takes something that's almost perfect, and actually makes it a game so near perfect it can get.

The worker placement aspects of this game are excellent and so is the variety of strategies that can be used when you include the expansions.

There are two things that reduce the scoring of this game.
1. It's only for 2 players. I would love to try it out with more players with this level of complexity and not the full Agricola experience. I think it might actually work with using 2 copies of this game for playing.

2. The expansions. The expansions makes this game work so much better. There's nothing at all wrong with the base game, but the lack of unique buildings to build is frustrating! If only 10 random buildings could be added to the base game it would make the core experience so much better.

*Oct 2012* Not as good as Homesteaders, IMO. This is the only game my wife has played with me so far that she asks me to play (though she hasn't played Homesteaders!). She always beats me, too. It is a great game, though, the reviews don't lie, and I enjoy it a lot. It also plays quickly, my wife and I have yet to play just one game of this in a sitting; at least a second game immediately follows. This game has made me want the full version of 'Gric, at which point I will sell this one. 

I will say that this is the only game I've played that feels like a full boardgame in 30 minutes. If you're on the fence about this one and don't own a wife-friendly, quick playing, and satisfying game, you will not be disappointed by this one. But get Homesteaders instead!

*update Dec 9, 2012* I own Agricola. Ever since buying this game, ACBaS has sat on the shelf. I don't think I'll be selling this game, especially since I now own the expansion. It's a great portable quick playing version of Agricola. 

*July 2013* Haven't played this game in a while. Forgot how insanely fun it is (even without expansion). Upped to an 8.5

I'm not a big fan of the original Agricola or Ora Et Labora for that matter, finding them too "big" for want of a better term. So the streamlined Agricola: ACBAS is much better suited to what both my wife & I prefer. That being said I grew less enamoured with the peaceful farming theme by the day and eventually traded this away particularly as it dawned on me that limited 2-player only titles do not meet my gaming requirements, at this point in my life, which is why I haven't picked up the otherwise excellent Targi ..

This "minigame" captures the quest for efficiency that you find in the original Agricola, but lacks the tension of what to do with your various resources. Specifically, without the need to feed your family, you never have to decide if animals are for cooking or mating, if grain is for cooking or planting. There is some tension in how you use the resources, but the main draw of Big and Small is the shorter time requirement. The full game offers a better experience with more tension and meaningful choices, and a more interesting narrative arc, than the kid sister.

En esta versión para dos jugadores nos encontramos una reducción de las acciones y eventos posibles, así como una contundente disminución en la duración del juego a tan solo 30 minutos. Es sustancialmente sencillo de aprender y las reglas, aunque mejorables en algunos puntos, son asequibles al neófito. Los jugadores se centran en la colocación de trabajadores para la obtención de recursos y ganado, en la división del terreno y posicionamiento de edificios y especies, en la diversificación en la crianza de animales en la granja, obligados por las penalizaciones en la puntuación. En esta versión además no deberán preocuparse de una fase de alimentación tan agónica en la versión original.

I've only played this game with my eldest daughter, but I've grown to like it more and more with each play. While it certainly isn't at the level of its big brother, this is an excellent, quick-playing two-player Euro.

For newcomers to the hobby, this is a great introduction to worker placement and the Agricola franchise. For experienced Agricola players, you might get a few plays out of it, but it's kind of like playing Agricola three times in a row with the exact same cards: you figure out a good path the first time, a better one the second time, a tiny bit better one the next time... Do you really need to do it again? Yes, there are expansions, but you basically get those in the box with Agricola. Since these are personal ratings, I'm going with my own interest in playing this, but I can see how this would have a longer lifespan in other situations.

Agricola light but maybe too lightweight for us as the base game doesn't give much options after our first play... needs the expansions to remain interesting in the long term? Will give it another try.

Update: I re-tried this game to play with my 6-year old son and he really liked it! He was going for the horses but forgot about the buildings so he lost in the end. The day after, he did a mix of horses and buildings and he eventually won by a big margin! 

We really liked the game as a fast intro to worker placement - plays 30-40 minutes, easy rules and cute wooden animeeples - will try the expansion next. Increased my rating from 7 to 8 but I guess it might go up with the first expansion. He keeps on asking to play the game again so that's already a good sign.

Really enjoyed this. It's what I want Agricola to be - Agricola without the pesky cards hurting my head too much!

Wow. This one surprised me so much. I was on the border of it for a long time. I like Euro games and worker placement games but don't think I would like them if they were long as in over an hour. This is why I have lords of waterdeep instead of agricola proper or pillars of the earth. I was on the edge of this one for some time.

Pros:
1. Looks like a nice light euro game, easy to learn, teach and play.
2. Looks like something fast and quick enough that you can travel with it and play it on a weeknight even if you wouldn't otherwise feel like play a game that was one or two hours or even 45 minutes. This only takes half hour at most.
3. Has cute animal meeples or animeeples which are adorable.

Percieved Cons:
1. Just another euro game (I thought). I already have plenty that don't get enough play, a few of which by Knizia and a couple of those I want to get rid of in retrospect.
2. Not, at first, an obviously exciting theme. Farming and only with animals.
3. General reviews by Agricola players were lukewarm, saying that this was just an inferior weak version of the original.
4. Only plays with 2 players.
5. As a euro game, the theme is probably pasted on.
-----------------------------------------
I've played it three times already and though I've only scratched the surface on figuring out viable strategies and tactics, this game is DEEPLY satisfying. An excellent game and a surprisingly good one.

-It feels relaxed and NON stressful. (I hear agricola has BAD stress associated with it. This is light-hearted)
-Yet it's still engaging and interesting. You want your farm to grow and enjoy seeing it grow. There's still a feeling of friendly competition that is real. 
-You don't feel like you're playing competitive solitaire even if that's what you're mostly doing. Largely because of competition for worker placement slots.
-The theme does work and does make sense. It's not the most thematic experience but this isn't JUST an abstracted strategy game with animals painted on it.
-This game is so very accessible and easy to learn and play. It really is. You teach it, set it up incredibly easy and yet.
-It's not a kids game. It's not luck based, random, or stupid. There is REAL strategy here and the game is almost completely determining if not entirely. There are no random luck modifiers here (sometimes those are good, but this one works great as high strategy only). This game is all about skill and thinking. You really can't win by luck. Unless you count your opponents choices as luck. There's just no randomizing effects and that makes ever choice especially meaningful and deep. But the relaxed theme and atmosphere and quick gametime make it so that you arn't kicking yourself if in retrospect you made a mistake.

-This game is FUN. And that's what matters. I never had much interest in farming games and maybe I should try agricola proper. Yet I still have a feeling I'll like this more. I can pull this out on a week night, on a weekend, on a sunday morning during coffee. This game is great, accessible, fun and high strategy while having just enough theme and cute little animals. It's balanced perfectly as a two player game so though more players would be cool, sometimes two player ONLY games make the best experiences for two players as compared to say, 2-5 player games played with only two.

No other way around it, this is a great game. I can't think of anyone who wouldn't appreciate and enjoy this game!

Played app and would give it a 6 but because the app sucked I think the main game would get a 7 or so. It was fine, but I didnt like how arbitrary stalls and stables added a certain number of spaces and some buildings had a fair bit of reading. And most of all I just found it inferior to Caverna which I find more epic and fun in scope. Decent 2p I suppose though.

This game is how I discovered that I don't like "tight" games. Turns and resources were so limited that I didn't feel like I had room to breathe.

RATING: 6
The game without expansions does not offer a lot of variability, and the two most interesting aspects of normal Agricola (the cards and the feeding) have been taken out of the game, making it less interesting to me, worse after ten games.
I might be looking into getting one of the two expansions, to give me more choices in every game, but my wife refuses to play it anymore, and since she is by far my main playing partner for two player games I decided to trade this game away. I don’t enjoy it enough to keep it around for the rare occasion when I play a two player game with somebody else.

I play games for escapism, to get away from my own life and spend time as a spacefaring alien race, the king of Spain in the age of exploration, a WWII general, etc. I'm not opposed to trying to manage a farm, if that is all I'm doing, but the mundanity of gathering food and feeding my family in Caverna and it's predecessor is just the kind of boring micromanagement that I'm trying to escape from. The 2-player Agricola: All Creatures Big And Small does away with the extraneous activities and lets players simply focus on animal husbandry, making it my favorite of this family of Uwe Rosenberg's games.

I enjoyed this game as a lighter Agricola.  It really boils Agricola down to some choice essentials, of course it leaves a lot of the fun as well on the shelf.

Agricola's animals distilled into a quick two player game in a Kosmos 2-player box size, and buildings now working double duty as fences as well. No variation at all in the setup, so the game gets heavily scripted with repeated playings. Definitely needs the expansions to be worth playing more than once.

A more frenetic take on worker placement than the Daddy game, due to having no need to feed, and I think it works very well. Having Animeeples coming in the box was a generous touch, and the mechanics lifted from previous Uwe games are almost excusable. Being a luck-free game is good, too.

For now, plenty of good tactics to be had (not much long-term strategy at all), but I can see it growing stale without some expansion buildings. Hopefully, they'll be free Essen goodies rather than a cash-in boxed expansion, because if it came down to it, I'd rather spend my money elsewhere, I suspect.

Further Thoughts: This is really starting to shine through now. The first expansion gives this masses and masses of legs, and I've a similar hope for the second. Two will probably do, though.

[b]Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]This game has been a hit with both of my older kids, especially my son. Most of our plays include buildings from Agricola: ACBaS – More and Even More Buildings. If I were only going to buy one expansion I would go with Agricola: ACBaS – Even More Buildings. Agricola ACBaS has seen steady play since we bought the game.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]- Excellent 2p worker placement game.
- Components and art are top notch, love the animeeples.
- I enjoy seeing what our farms look like after the game, we always have a story as to what kind of farm we created. 
(I always feel bad having 10 sheep crammed into a stable).
- The expansion buildings really make you think outside of the box as you plan your farm. 
- 30 minute play time packed with strategy.
- Extremely high replay value once you add the expansion buildings (I can't believe we've played this 50+ times).[/i]

03/04/17:

Played it once previously with wife on vacation but can't remember specifics so played again with 6 year old son. He couldn't really grasp the strategy of balancing the need for all 4 animal types to avoid getting negative points. Maybe it is my fault for not reminding him to do so too. 

It is quite agonizing to be able to get enough horses and cows to avoid the negative points and the main point was not breeding early enough. A classic game design from Uwe Rosenberg where there are many things to do but not nearly enough time and actions to do them all. As it stands, I might consider culling this as it seems there is only one path to victory and that is to minimize negative points and focus on amassing one or two animal types through an early breeding scheme. I don't think the buildings give enough VP to warrant investing greatly in them. 

Will need another playthrough with wife to have my final review.

A fun to play game for two players. The game is short so you don't have to reserve a whole evening to play it. It has just enough complexity so you don't get bored. The rules are easy to understand and the clear construction of the game helps with the rules so once you have read the rules you have to look up hardly anything.

A really nice two player implemantation, capturing the feel of Agricola but making it all happen in 30-45 minutes, which is just right for a friendly spouse type game. The tension of the main game is still there (do I need to take these resources now or can I wait), but there's a ton of options so if worse comes to worse, there's generally other good stuff you can do, making it friendly. There's still plenty of good decisions on the the most efficient way to expand your farm and house all your breeding animals, and min-maxing VPs. While it doesn't have the full-on flavour of the cards, it does provide a selection of different buildings each game to mix it up. A worthy addition to the line.

This one is a brain burner!  But it is so much fun.  You only get 24 turns (8 rounds, 3 turns each round).  So you try and figure out the best thing to do each round.  But then, the other player takes the action spot you were going to take, and now you have to choose a different spot and reevaluate your plan.  Ahhh!!!

RATING: 7
Based on one play: This game does a good job of bringing the main mechanics of Agricola to two players while also really simplifying the game. In this version, your main concern is the number of animals you have, it removes house expansion, family growth and a lot of things, while maintaining a simplified Agricola feel. If you love the complexities of Agricola, this is likely not for you, but if there is a non-gamer you want to play a similar type of game with, this would fit well as it is much easier to play.

This game is exactly what it tries to be: a short 2-player game that uses the worker placement mechanics of and wonderfully evokes the feeling of Agricola.  The game is limited thematically to raising animals and eliminates feeding, but you still very much feel like you're trying to take actions at optimal times and building up your player board.  My one complaint (which precludes a higher rating from me) is that the game is completely deterministic: there is no variable setup and no random elements, so you could end up playing the same game over and over again.  But if you like Agricola but want a short 2-player version, this is definitely worth a look.

Agricola is one of my favorite games, so I was happy to be able to pick this up in a recent clearance sale. All Creatures is all about acquiring animals. To that end, players need to build fences and building that will allow them to store the animals. This game is almost as tight as its big brother, but plays quickly with less rules complexity. I’m not sure I’ll keep it permanently, but I’m looking forward to a few more plays.

Wonderful tight & balanced game that brings the essence of Agricola in a smaller package and shorter play-time. It should almost be mandatory for designers of micro-euros to play this half a dozen times and get a feel for the perfect balance of scarcity and competition and engine building and pace that is possible in a stripped down miniaturized Euro game.  

The expansions are great too. They don't so much change the nature of play, as enhance it by giving other ways to balance resources or modify the pace at which you can shift gears as you build your positions. Every move will find you wanting to do multiple things and every move counts. You will never end the game feeling that random chance or weaknesses in the game design penalized you. Whether you win or lose, it will be the result of your strategy and execution.

Great 2 player game *with expansions added (game quickly becomes predictable with only the base set). Regular Agricola requires quite the setup for only 2 players, and sometimes you want to just play. This solves the problem. Quick setup, quick play, nearly as challenging and not as frustrating as regular Agricola can be.

Agricola without needing to feed your family, and in a relatively short 8 turns to build everything up and get all the creatures, apparently works.

There's really only one path to victory: get as many animals as you can. Competition is for animals, and resources for stalls and fences.

Pretty fun, though I imagine that you might quickly figure out a good strategy, and that it then gets same-y fast. The expansions help with that, and a few different buildings every game from those take it from a 7 to an 8.

This is a farming game that focuses on the raising of Animals. Using a tight worker placement board, you build fences, gather animals and build point scoring buildings. At the end of each round, 2 or more of a type of animal will produce an extra one of that type. At the end of the game, animals will score depending on how many you have of each type. The game will give you negative points for missing a type. Without the expansions this game has very little replayability, as you see the same content every game, but with the expansions you get a semi-random array of buildings each game which keeps things exciting. This is a delightful little mini Agricola experience that discards a lot of what I disliked about that game. It's one of the only 2 player games I can get regularly played with my wife, which is a big plus in my book.

RATING: N/A
Agricola-lite, and that's probably not very descriptive, especially since low-calorie alternatives make pretty major concessions. You have a Farmer Action Menu and you choose actions, here made up of your fairly standard resources, buildings, or animals. Unlike Agricola Major, there's no "pay the game back" hole in your bucket, so the tension isn't the same. This one is more about the diluted panic that sets in as you struggle to grow your infrastructure to keep up with your ever-expanding animal population. 

I'm not sure what to say about depth. For starters, the basic game probably isn't "Deep" by a traditional measure, as the fixed setup and fixed building roster means the game would eventually become solvable (make no mistake about it -- without  a computer, this would take you a loooooong time to do). With the expansion buildings, that reprioritizes things and causes you to value some resources differently as the player strategies diverge more. 

I happen to enjoy the dread that Agricola Major has so much of, so the minor panic here is enjoyable but nothing like the original. I'd still rank this one above "2p Family Game version of Agricola," though.

Very enjoyable game. It generally plays the same over time (if you play with the same player) since there are no random factors but it is stillquite good and if people experiment a bit early game than the entire game will shift so playing with people who change up their strategy or playing with different people will give this mroe replayability.

Agricola jr. This game is so incredibly quick that you always just BARELY seem to get things done in time, if at all. I loved it.

RATING: 10
(42 plays)

One of the games that made me really passionate about the hobby, and still one of the best two player games out there imo. Own the first expansion as well. I played again for the first time in months and it hasn't lost a step. A gem and I'll play this over Papa Agricola anytime. Just easier to get table and captures the same experience in a more elegant way, and in a super fast playtime. The first expansions elevates this little game to a masterpiece.

RATING: 7
A good filler for gamers. Obviously not as deep or complex as Agricola - the actions are much fewer and there's no feeding - but still requires a lot of thought for a 30 minutes game. No randomness involved, meaning the better player will always win, but also replayability in the same group may be limited because of both limited variability and group thinking.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Trimmed down Agricola, why not? Generally, because I'd just as soon play a 2p game of Gric - so portability is the main draw: something to pack for a short holiday.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.9
Great game, fun, easy, yet deep and makes you want to try again for a higher score! Less stress than Agricola, feeding people sucks more and more as you get older, like paying taxes.  

Very portable! I took this on a three week vacation and we played it at night in our downtime!  The expansion is needed to give it some greater replay ability. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's all the same worker placement on limited spots that regular Agricola dishes up, but stripped of the brain burning feeding of people, cards, crops, etc. On it's own it's a simplified good little Agricola rip off for two people. As a whole all it's got going for it is the smaller box size. Regular Agricola already allows you to play without the cards. It allows for a game that's simplified enough and works fine with to players. So if you have Agricola then there's really no need to play this unless it's with kids or as an introduction to entry level gamers. As either of those two things it works very, very well. But if you enjoy Agricola then I wouldn't bother with this if you're not playing with kids or entry level gamers or you've only got 20 minutes for a game of something that feels like Agricola.

If you go the expansion route you get a much better game - especially if you ignore the rules and add eight tiles instead of four - and a game that plays significantly differently each time. Unfortunately the expansion is an extra investment that I can't justify having gone that route with the full Agricola game already.

Why the English title? I'd have preferred the proper text "All creatures great and small" if you're going in the direction of borrowing from All Things Bright and Beautiful. What's going on there at Z-Man Games? First Endeavor loses its "u" and now this. Where will it end?

It's a reasonably fun game you'll tire of quickly. But wait, there's a building expansion. Oh no... I'm falling down a slippery slope...

--------------

Update: Okay, I'm warming to this one. At first I couldn't see why you'd bother if you owned the full Agricola - just play without any cards I thought. Now I see the point a little better. Small box. Quick setup. Can play with my six year old and introduce him to the world of Agricola. Plays in about 20 minutes. In its own right it's a good game.

This is a wonderful little coffee house game for me and my wife.  I'm a little worried that multiple games with the same partner could burn the game out quickly, however.  The lack of round escalation and randomization, not to mention the lack of cards, found in Agricola proper leave only the propensity of your gaming partner to change a chosen strategy to provide a dynamic gaming experience from session to session.

We'll see, but still it scratches the farming itch in the time it takes to finish a white chocolate mocha, and that's awesome.

My wife and I get to play head to head games occasionally, and this one is a new addition for us.  It's fun, a little bit competitive and has several ways to earn a victory, so we're always playing around with new strategies.  I'm not a big fan of Agricola, but this one is just great.

Wow, I like this game so much better than it's big brother. I've only played with both expansions, so the starting setup vary from game to game. There is a lot of valuation in this one, and there are actually quite a few places I want to go. Unlike Agricola, where I can usually get to at most one of the worker placement slots that I wanted each round, the worker placement in All Creatures Big and Small feels open enough that you can accomplish things but tight enough that you always want to do more than you actually can.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A really enjoyable game that scales down Agricola but retains the feel of the original. The game is a bit lighter as you aren't trying to feed you family or have a handful of cards, but the strategy is still there and the setup time is not.

This is a very solid two players game. The game feels very much similar to Agricola, except that a) you are only dealing with animals, b) you do not need to worry about feeding, and c) takes way less time to play.
Expansions are a must have as playing with the same base buildings gets boring and scripted after a few plays. The expansions adds a lot of very interesting buildings making the game highly replayable.

I got this before I picked up Caverna. It's "cute enough" for my SO to want to play. She giggles every time she gets to breed a "sheepy-sheep" after a round.  Even I can't help but smile every time a cow or horse animeeple does a faceplant. Very cute animeeples. 

The games are quick, competitive, and deep enough that I can play it over and over again without getting tired of it. 
The only downside is I get stuck in a rut, trying to build the same farm over and over again (kind of my Caverna problem too).

[5 plays] First two plays with my 11 year old daughter Ruth. Her first step into a meatier euro (she has played Dominion, Qwirkle, and lots of decent kid games by Haba and Rio Grande) Ruth picked up on it very well and improved her score vastly in the second game.

This is cute, fast, streamlined version of Agricola. I wish I had tried the family version of base Agricola to compare. I suspect I would like that better, but I'm not at all sure it would have been a better way to teach her or would have held her interest as well either.

I think this is a great little 2 player worker placement game, with plenty of angst if you want to play it hard with someone. With Ruth we both took it seriously, but I only ever considered my best move, and wasn't looking at blocking the way I might with a peer.

Excellent production values with tons of cute animals. 

Taught this to Garrett who liked it and beat me first play.

Most recent play July '15.

I got this game used as part of a larger purchase. I had heard it was OOP and that it was worth more than the asking price. My wife and I enjoy Uwe Rosenberg's Patchwork so I figured it was worth giving another 2-player game a shot. This game is a quick yet solid worker placement game. If you really try to make fast decisions, you can play an entire game in 30-35 minutes; however, decisions are usually more difficult as you develop your player board. I have yet to try its first expansion but a quick look through the new tiles it offers gives me reason to believe it will greatly improve upon any limitations of the base game.

This is one of our favorite games. In fact, when I asked Michelle about what she thought the ideal couples game was, she said this and Jaipur came closest. Play time is much shorter than Stone Age, but the gameplay is heftier in some ways, since you have a farm to build. Component quality is excellent: the artwork on the boards is fantastic, and the animeeples give it a lot of character. 

The only thing is that it can get a little repetitive with many plays. The expansions help some, but if you get bored with the gameplay they won't help (though I don't see this happening for us in the near future).

Played at CPG against PA.  

Learned this rather quickly as I've played Agricola several times.  I'm not a huge gric fan ... I've seen it described as swimming up a waterfall of peanut butter and that's what it feels like to me.  THIS game, however, felt different.  I really enjoyed this one and I lost by double digits my first time.  I would really consider buying this and playing with the wife.  I thought I was done with Gric games too.

I don't care much for Agricola, but for some reason All Creatures Big and Small works for me. It's a short and simple version that strips out a lot, but still leaves you with some fun choices. The game nearly died out for me until I happened upon the first expansion, which is an absolute must. The game becomes too mundane without the different building options. Regardless, it's still pretty formulaic and you'll typically try to more or less do the same thing each game. It's an enjoyable experience and fun to play every now and then.

This is Agricola and Le Havre blended together, streamlined, and shortened. Compared to Agricola, there isn't the same tension or depth, but there's less setup, upkeep, and playing time. Agricola is a cutthroat strategy game that ends before players have a chance to coast on their momentum; ACB&S is a low-interaction, zero-luck engine builder that amply rewards both players for their efforts. It's probably the best intro worker placement game simply because of its length, but I miss the tension of its big brother.

Great take on the bigger Agricola. It preserves the planning and feel of Agricola, but with less tension/stress. However, you NEED at least one of the expansions for replayability.

I was underwhelmed by Agricola, and lent it to my sister after only two plays. It's not that it's bad, it just isn't very much game for all the setup. If I'm going to spend that amount of time on setup and clean up, I'm going to play something that's a lot better than Agricola.

This version is [i]so much better[/i]! It's much quicker in both setup and play, and the rules are easily taught before and/or during the first play through with a new player. You do get -3 points for each type of animal of which you have 3 or less at the end of the game, but those are the only negative points in the whole game. While Agricola punishes you at every turn, All Creatures Big and Small feels constantly rewarding.

It's half a point worst than Agricola.

RATING: 6
This game is way, WAY better than Agricola, even though its title sucks and it doesn't exactly include ALL creatures, does it?  Admittedly, the base game requires the addition of some expansion buildings to keep it from being "solvable", but with them it becomes a really excellent 2-player worker placement game with lovely components.  It's simple and plays quickly (though almost too quickly - I wish there was one more game turn to finish off that perfect farm).  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6/10

Don't be fooled by the size and game length. This offers a very similar brain workout to Agricola. Many BGG users here seem to equate game length with game weight. Whilst naturally it has less going on without the Occupation Cards, the buildings offer a similar experience to the Improvement cards in Agricola.

It is certainly not for the faint hearted or those new to modern board gaming or the worker placement genre. As a comparison I would rank it's weight somewhere between Stone Age and Agricola.

[Zman 12 edition] {Farm; work-placement, resources management} Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small is a wonderful 2p implementation of Agricola.  It keeps all the essence of Agricola: resource management, the urgency of feeding, and you-want-to-do-more-action-than-you-can.

Player inaction is strong! I like it.

It's not that easy to teach this game, there are many action types and details.

The illustration is absolutely wonderful.   The production is top notch.  Thumb up.

Could this be the perfect two-player game AND the perfect wife-game, all in one go?

Super-fast 2 player Agricola. It's more fun than the 'proper' Agricola, because it's so much faster, but played with the wrong person, could easily bog down in to analysis and blocking moves.

Incidental blocking still exists, but seemed less likely to occur based on one (quick) play.

I don't honestly know how many times I'd want to play, but I didn't hate it as much as I expected to.

Seriously though, if you AP during this game, I'm going to stab you in the eye.

This plays like a euro version of Chess. I love that it is completely balanced (aside from the usual first player issue) and it is a tight, quick, highly interactive worker placement game. The simplicity isn't necessarily a weakness as it streamlines play, however there are very few buildings to choose from that limits strategic choices (the expansion may help here). I love how pressed players are to try and achieve everything they need to on a given turn and before game end, and the tension between the back and forth, hoping the other player won't take needed placement locations. It is a bit limiting in terms of strategy (both players have to achieve essentially the same things, eg minimum of all animals) but is rich in tactical decisions and how you go about achieving that end.

I've never played regular Agricola, but I have a feeling I still will prefer this version even if I do. It's often described as a fat-trimmed version of it's namesake, and I can agree there isn't much fluff in this game. An excellent two player game, and one I'll play whenever my wife suggests it.

RATING: 7
I like Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small, but even for two players, given enough time I'll choose Agricola over its two-player cousin every time. The main drawback here obviously is depth, variety and thus replayability. All Creatures is cute, and does offer some interesting choices despite its fairly quick half-hour play time. And it's nice to not be worried about feeding your family all the time, though I do miss eating a tasty cow now and again with this one! In the end, I think All Creatures just doesn't have enough "there' there to hit the table often. It's more of a one-in-a-while, if-I'm-in-the-right-mood game.

Agricola: ACBS is one of the best 2-player small box games available.  Worker placement is put to good use here, providing a range of choices each round but limiting them to three.

Absolutely love it so far. Was initially a little worried that this game would become repetitive, but so far we've been trying different strategies each game and it doesn't seem repetitive at all. It definitely has that Agricola feel, but a game lasts about 20 minutes and set up is fast. I think an expansion with more special buildings and maybe some cards (like occupations or minor improvements) would really make this one of the best two player games out there for years to come.

Update: Not long after I got the game they announced an expansion. I'm still loving the base game, but the expansion looks like it will be a must-buy. I can't wait.

It's beautiful, it's short, and I like this kind of drafting where the price or value of something may change (in this game: it's the value). However, I do prefer it when the stuff you are drafting is used in some way that interacts with other players, which definitely doesn't happen here.

I got this to get a taste of Agricola, and maybe modern Rosenberg in general. It's nice but I don't need much more of it.

What you draft is piles of resources (which can accumulate if not taken), the Start Player privilege, and the right to buy things slash convert resources, or place your fence markers. I find it funny how easy it is to imagine making any game idea work by phrasing it in terms of this general system.

The total lack of randomness plus being two-player is bothersome. It puts the game squarely in chess territory, which means I'm more interested in watching an AI play it than in playing it myself. The idea of increasing the longevity of this game by adding more building options (as they are doing) doesn't strike me as promising at all. I think it would be easier and more effective to randomly close off a couple of the actions every round.

...Ok, I threw together a variant with three players and random space closures every round. It's a bit much (particularly with there only being one space that lets you build troughs) but it was promising.

...I should add, it's clear to me that the reason I don't love the game is the spatial component, the specific rules of building up your farm. I feel I can't analyze complicated systems like this to learn something general about game design. And as a player it just has the feel of a solitaire puzzle to figure out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small is all about timing. The earlier you get pairs of animals, the sooner they'll start multiplying -- but you'll also need to budget time to build the fencing and buildings to support your livestock. The entire game only takes about 30 minutes, and the relatively tedious between-round board reset feels like it can take up half the game. Adjusting your strategy based on available worker spots is rewarding, though, and the little wooden animeeples are fun to play with.

An excellent 2 player adaptation of the full game! Having only two actions per turn, and only eight turns, makes every one feel important. But the game doesn't punish you too much for a bad decision.
It's interactive enough to not feel like a game of competitive solitaire, but it's not cutthroat; there is always a solid backup action to take if your opponent steals the best one on the board. 
Will definitely remain a favorite 2 player!

Agricola with less tension.  Still fun to get the stuff and see how many points you can make.  I like this.  I like the animals.  

Since is so short it's easy to lose in a single moment when the opponent takes the action you needed.  Don't pigeonhole yourself.  

I like this unforgivingness in other games but not here.  Seems to not fit what the game is about.  Casually getting animals and building stuff on a fun afternoon.  

Solid.

This much lighter 2-player version of Agricola still offers the players plenty of interesting decisions in what is typically a 30 or 40 minute game. Cudos to Mr Rosenberg for having the courage to heavily streamline such a well-loved game as Agricola. And in doing so reach casual players who found the original too involved or too long (like my girlfriend ;-)). In order to stay fresh after a of plays, the base game does need one of the More Buildings expansions.

RATING: 7
Mechanics very similar to Agricola --> good thing because it is easy to teach and learn (for people who know Agricola already). Simple game play and setup are definitely a big positive for me here.

I'm quite concerned about the replayability though (after one play). As there are no random elements in the game, I am afraid the game could start to feel very much the same-y. I usually prefer games that force you to adapt as they make each game feel different - in ACBaS there is very little of this happening.

This is the perfect Euro filler for two. The half hour play time is dead accurate, even as a teaching game. The small action board creates just as much tension as its big brother, but no family feeding makes it much more forgiving. The expansions add some much needed variety though, and are practically required for repeat plays.

A great little "gateway" Agricola.  If you're looking at introducing a friend to the main game, you can do a lot worse than teaching them this first. 
Pity it's only 2 player... I reckon it'd be a truly fantastic game with 3 or 4!  Hmmm... Maybe using 2 copies (it's pretty inexpensive) and placing the order tiles side-by-side.  Players can place their meeples on either of the boards (allowing double use of action spaces) but only 1 of the "first player" spaces can be taken each round.  
Might just have to try this out.

2 player Agricola, but about 30 minutes long and you don't have to feed your people.  Still retains that feeling of having too many things to do, but not enough time feeling.  Lots of decisions to make for a short game.  Great!  Terrific components and compact design A+.  Really a perfect game for my wife and I.

Would definitely recommend the first expansion to add replayability.  I'm not sure the second expansion is necessary though.

RATING: 8
I enjoy this game more than I'm rating it because I feel it was unnecessarily hampered to require it's expansion to really have long-term re-playability.

I feel like first player gets an unfair advantage.  They get the better started resources on turn 1, and in order for the other player to take that privilege, they have to bite the bullet and take the weaker resource pool as a sacrifice to get first player back.  I guess that's legacy from the original Agricola, one of the things I didn't like in that game either.

Overall though, a very tight, fast-paced, and enjoyable game in a small package.   The expansion(s) really elevate it to something fun and different each time you pull it out.

Excellent game. So much quicker to play than Agricola and almost scratches the same itch. However it does not replace the original agricola as there is no fight against starvation. Basically it takes animal breeding and pasture building from the original, adds a bit of content to them and strips the rest. The result is one of the best 2 player games you can play in 30 minutes.
Rating without expansions is 8.5 but with both expansions this becomes a 10 for me.

**PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION

Fun little filler that looks Agricola-like, but is more relaxed because it doesn't have the struggle to survive. It has cute and attractive components too!

Love it after a few plays, but question its replayability in the long term as we nearly ran out of animals in one game... And industrially farming sheep feels too powerful.

UPDATE: Upgraded to nine after more plays. The super-sheep strategy is beatable, at least with the expansion. A nice cute meaty filler.

Agricola light for two players. Although I haven't played Agricola, there's no doubt, not only in the title, but gameplay where this game gets it's influence from. It's a nice relaxing game of building up your farm without the need to worry about feeding everyone every round. Fun and straight forward but not a whole lot of interaction between players. Farm building solitaire with a friend maybe? Regardless, with the expansion it adds a few more buildings so the game is different every time.

I must confess I have never played Agricola, so I have no way to compare this 'light version' to its bigger brother. What I can say, is that this is really a 2-player game I enjoy ... A LOT! It is very easy to learn and teach. But for a relative simple game, it has a lot depth – especially when including the two expansions. Packed correctly, all components – including the expansions – can be in stored in one box … making it an ideal game for traveling.

I feel as though Uwe addresses many of my concerns with his larger games in his 2p games, primarily that of lateral options/breadth. Not only that, but his 2p games really are designed specifically for just 2 players in the sense that many 2 to 4 player games, yes, still work somewhat with 2 but turn into a wildly different experience with a significant shift in play-style and dynamic. 2p Agricola works fantastically and excels beyond other 4p games played with 2.

I have always wanted to like Agricola, but it has some critical flaws.  Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small addresses all of them.  This is a great, quick, worker placement game that can be played in 30 mins.  Just like Agricola, you can't always do what you want on every turn.  You can never do everything you want before game ends.  Unlike Agricola, there aren't choke points where both players are racing towards (reed and family growth) that can nearly insure victory.  The game feels a bit more forgiving in that sense.  Also, since it is only 30 minutes (compared to 2-hours), if you are losing, it will not drag out for too much longer.  It is often harder to tell you are losing in this game anyway so you don't feel like it is over before it is over, even when it is.  Everyone always has an equal number of workers (an big issue in Agricola balancing: more workers = more power = more food = more workers = rich get rich).  This game really does a great job of scratching the Agricola itch, without having to play Agricola.  It is quick and light for when there isn't that much time.  Caverna can replace Agricola when there is a lot of time.

The one major downside to this game is the lack of variability.  Without one of the expansions, the only variability is what the other player decides to pick and how you react to that.  If you play with various people (or someone who likes to vary their strategy), that can be a enough to keep up the replay value.  If you play with someone likes to hone in on one strategy and always play it, then it can run its course.  The expansions alter that a bit, but not too much.  They don't add too much to the game, but sometimes enough to make it interesting.  Sometimes it doesn't though...

Still, a great game to pull out when you want a quick Agricola or worker placement itch with less commitment.  Love it.

There is surprising amount of possible strategies in this small game which is great. It can be very tense. It takes just the right amount of time to play.

And by the way ... this is probably my wife's favorite game ... and this by itself raises the rating by 1 additional point.

Agricola simplified, with just the animals, no crops, jobs, improvements, etc.  and very very few buildings. Straightforward, easily learned rules, clearly iconised easily used components, quick play and no randomisation. If I had any complaints at all about this game, they would be that it's a bit too short, making it very hard to recover from bad decisions, and that it has to be played highly competitively, as you cannot allow your opponent to play his own game unhindered. Especially if he wants to play with sheep. Sheep are the key to success.

Agricola for two, playable in half an hour? Awesomesauce. It retains all the best qualities of the original (no, I am not the greatest fan of helper decks) - there's always too little time, and yet by the end, both players will always have achieved a lot. A must have for players often stuck in two-player sessions.

It is not Agricola but a very nice 2P game on its own. Right up there with the best of the Kosmos 2P games.

A great 2 player game! It's really fun to build up your farm and plan it out.

On first play we weren't aware of the scoring, so it would really help to know that first so you know what to really work towards.

All in all a great game with many options to go about during your turn.

Highly recommended for a 2 player game.

I like this as a quick&dirty game of Agricola. It's less taxing than the regular game is (requires less planning) while keeping the spirit of what I like about this game. And the games plays a lot quicker too!

I do miss variety in the buildings. I like that they went for a more streamlined version where you can easily keep track of all the available options, but I would have liked to see a few more options.

RATING: 7
Captures enough of it's predecessor to make an enjoyable quick little puzzle. Looks like the extra buildings are necessary after a few plays but mechanically this is a solid 2-player game, even if you haven't played the big one.

Not as good as "regular" Agricola, because of rather limited choices and replayability. Still one of the best two-player light games out there at the moment.

What a great little two player game.  I didn't think that they could condense Agricola down but they managed to and it turned out to be a fantastic game.  It has a quicker set up time and a lot of quality gameplay for such a small box.  I do feel like the game is a little overpriced but for Agricola lovers who are looking for a quicker game with a smaller package and set up time, this is the game to buy.  We have had fun with the base game but can easily tell that the expansions are a must for variety.  There are still many tense decisions and the unique building every game make for insane replay value.  This killed Agricola for me and I sold it off (but may acquire it again someday).  Nice production quality and my wife loves this one!

Note: Includes a custom Artscow bag to hold the building tiles.

My son's game. I like this game. So much, that I decided to buy both expansions. What I don't like about it is the minus points for animals and rather strict times (just 8 rounds).

This is every bit the pleasant 2 player worker placement experience I hoped it would be.  Focusing on just the animal breeding portion of "Big Agricola" is pretty genius for a light, 20-30 minute game and seeing your farmyard fill with animals is quite satisfying.  Easy enough for my 4 year old to at least go through the motions and enjoy building her farmyard while having enough decisions to play at a higher level with other gamers.  I'm very happy I picked this up even if my 2 player gaming opportunities are a little slim.

Yep.  Focus Agricola on the animals, make it for two players only, and you can compress it to 30 minutes of tough decisions and worker blocking.  The rules have been tweaked a little, but if you know Agricola like the back of your hand, you can learn this game in 60 seconds.

At the moment one of my favorite 2-player games. Quite some decisions and different approaches, lots of interaction and: quick rules and fast play-time (less than 30 mins). If you want a medium 2-player game, go for this one. Bonus points: breeding baby-sheep is an instant +1 rating from the girlfriend :)

This is a decent euro with certain mechanics that feel familiar and reasonably fun to play around with including:  Puerto Rico style action selections wherein the "action selecting" player gets a full action so to speak, and the rest of the players get a half action; resource generation and expenditure to buy asymmetric advantage buildings, and end game goals that vary from game to game.  

The action selections are influenced, somewhat interestingly, by a moderately clever linear track that eventually (although sometimes after far too much time depending upon player actions) tolls the end of the round.  I liked that mechanic.  The end game goals are somewhat hidden to the players at the beginning of the game, and must be selectively discovered by taking a "peek at a goal or goal cards" action.  I had mixed feelings about that mechanic, but I must admit, it was a little fresh. 

I did not like the resource tracks or flimsy board.  An actual board and actual resource cubes seemed more appropriate.

All in all, a worthy game that for my tastes felt like it needed a bit more play testing to develop fully.

I could have given this game a higher rating if it was more complete. A mixed bag of stolen/barrowed mechanics crudly implemented. There is nothing new here. There is to little varity. I rather play eminent domain that does everything better than this game. This game could be great with more finetuning. I rather play suburbia/castle of  mad king ludwig or peoloppones to get the citybuilding taste and eminent domain or puerto rico/race for the galaxy for i choose you fallow to read and manuver around your opponent satisfaction. And argent the consortium for discovering the scoring. Everything at once left everything bland.

The game has a nice flow and seems well designed. On the other hand it is only good and not great enough to be played regularly.

There are some really interesting aspects to this game, and if it was put together better, I think it could be a really stellar game.  The Kings Wrath aspects to the kings will cards are not harsh enough, and also seem too easy to satisfy.  Also, even though the 1 point is nice and juicy, I wish there was a mechanism to move actions forward if no one is selecting the first option.  I also wish there was one less option available, as it did feel a bit too easy to do what you wanted.  The game probably also felt one round too long.  I think the secret scoring idea is really cool, and its one of my favorite scoring mechanisms out there, but it is just done way better in Argent.  Dang, this one could of been cool, but just seems under developed to me.

RATING: 7.5
A hint of Puerto Rico with the mechanic of the active player choosing a double action, while non-active players get a single action.
The scoring has a hint of Argent: the Consortium, as there are 8 hidden scoring cards and you have to score 4 of them.
There is no downtime since you have an action on every player's turn. 
The one criticism is that the King's Wrath of -2VPs in every category is too easy to avoid as it wasn't very hard to avoid them. Perhaps some house rules to increase the penalty to increase the tension in that one aspect.

Grafik spricht mich überhaupt nicht an. Auch sonst ist die Präsentation relativ beliebig. Zuviel Ikonografie. Der Aktionsauswahlmechanismus und die unbekannten Ziele sind schön. Reichen aber nicht um mich zu überzeugen. neben West of Africa der nächste "Pass" für mich für den Verlag.

Alles, was der Kritiker an KINGS WILL kritisiert, ist das, was der Liebhaber lieben wird. Es gibt gefühlt kaum ein Euro-Charakteristikum, das KINGS WILL nicht auslässt: Themenbeliebigkeit, Aktionswahl anno PUERTO RICO, Ressourcenmanagement, Entwicklungsleisten, Rundenabgaben, obligatorische Endbedingungen für die Schlusswertung. Haptikerleben und Materialqualität reichen von sehr gut (alles an Holz und Plättchen) bis geizig (Spielfelder aus Dünnpappe im alea-Brück-Sparmodus). Die Art Direction des "stets erstaunlichen" Harald Lieske ist auch wieder wenig erstaunlich und typisch Lieske Spielworxx-Gebrauchsgrafik. Na ja. KINGS WILL wäre womöglich nicht besonders erwähnenswert, wären da nicht die Hidden Victory Conditions, die man sich im Laufe des Spiels erschliessen muss und dem Spiel auch im übertragenen Sinne ein originelles Geheimnis verleihen. Ein Hauch von Deduktion, Rückschlüsse ziehen und Memory durchweht KINGS WILL als feine, flüchtige Aromanote über dem Gewohntem. Ein Glück dem  Herzog in der Pfalz, der Zorn des Königs ist ein verborgenes Lächeln. KINGS WILL macht sich nicht die Mühe seine innere Schönheit hinter dem offensichtlichen "just another soulless Eurogame" aufzuhübschen und an die große Kirchenglocke zu hängen und pflegt stattdessen das stille Selbstverständnis eines klassischen Autoren- und Liebhaberspiels ohne Make-up und höhere Weihen. God save König Otto.

Played the Prototype in a final state and realy enjoyed it! The ammount of actions is so tight that you need to know what's the King's Will... just can't do everything.
Definitly a must buy for me.

INITIAL IMPRESSION
Mechanically cool. Secret goals, al la Argent the Consortium. Action selection along a row with the chooser getting to do 2x the actions. Bunch of other generic Euro stuff to round it out

Issue for me seems to be one of tense and options. Felt like the game went 1 round too long because everyone was easily able to see 80%+ of the goal cards and complete all of theirs while easily negating the negatives of others. The negatives were extremely easy to handle

The upgrades to actions seemed expensive for what they did mostly. King track penalty was easily handled and the options for trading for points was limited and didn't seem better at the high end. Wood, Stone, Leather, Wheat was also nothing new for resources and the expanding land/growing people doesn't seem like a big factor (everyone just gets a few)

Too many unpolished issues with this game, mechanically it had potential but just falls flat

共通目標が伏せられていてそれを知るためのコストがかかったり、資源を勝利点に変換する機会が極めて限られていたり、ラウンドごとのノルマをどこまで達成すべきか選択できたり、終了フラグを切るのを完全にプレイヤーに任せていたりと、ゲーマーが作ったであろうことが一目瞭然な意欲作。荒いが、魅力的。

King's Will has an interesting central action selection mechanism that vaguely reminds of Puerto Rico with the characteristic that the selecting player can execute both functions of the selected tile while the other players can follow on a single action. The selected tile is placed at the end of the row of tiles and the other tiles that were behind it, are move ahead until the King's Will tile ends up in front of the row. At this time, the will of the king has to be fulfilled and victory points can be traded for.

Another choice at this time are the hidden victory conditions. In each King's will phase, players select 1 out of 8 hidden available conditions. Either one they have peaked at before and liked or a blind choice. This is where the game fails for me. Some of the conditions can be easily achieved without doing anything else than planned anyway or simply doing  something which cannot be countered. Other conditions can be a difficult struggle without much payout. Another element I don't like are the boring two linear 'tech trees' allowing cheaper builds or more efficient resource gathering. The many different elements together can cause serious AP with optimizers.

The King's Will works, features the usual Euro tropes but does nothing better than its inspirations. The lengthy explanation for the many unique buildings and victory conditions is a further turnoff. I rather play Puerto Rico or Orleans instead.

Fills a gap complexity wise between Puerto Rico and San Juan. There's no need to sell your goods for money or vps and  so the learning curve for new players is not that steep.
With Puerto Rice there is the problem of inexperienced players interferring with experienced players' strategies; this game is better for mixed groups.
I don't have a problem with the face down victory conditions; you need to know maybe5 of them (out of 8). More may be an advantage, but I think you can play competitively with less, too.

The King's Will mixes known mechanisms without creating anything unique. The action selection, where part of the action may be taken by all players, reminds about Puerto Rico, while the engine building, where knowledge and buildings make certain actions more powerful, can be found in most euros nowadays. 

Yet, there is some pleasure to be found in setting up your board so that you will benefit the most of the actions likely to come (or choosing the actions that benefit the others the least). The secret victory conditions, of which some may be previewed and committed to, seem like an unnecessary addition though and the many different buildings make the game hard to learn. However, once started the game flows quickly and delivers the typical euro feeling of progress.

tl;dr: solid dry euro

Oh, this game is tight. All game long everyone is scraping for money and resources. As soon as you get anything, you'll be very, very tempted to spend it right there and then, because there's so much you want to do and so little you can do. But the pain is quite enjoyable. OK, it is pretty dry, but that doesn't bother me. There's plenty of options to explore and I expect there to be many strategies that are viable.

Very nice package and a very thorough treatment.  I was especially pleased to see a "first day" and a "second/third day" map in addition to the four that make the whole battle area.  These will make smaller scenarios much easier to play.  Thank you MMP!

Smoothest design I've seen for so much accuracy.

This game will not replace the more detail-oriented 
CWB series for me (RSS may have been going overboard),
but it's earned its keep. Very very impressive.

Good quality stuff is capable of pressing attacks
maybe a little too well.

My favorite game in my favorite system. Line of Battle is the definitive treatment at the regimental scale.

The full battle played solo will certainly be a handful, but then again this is Gettysburg in all its glory. Not a true monster, but it is a major game. Totally dig the map, but it could have been made a bit more LOS friendly. The player can implement quite a few options for play.

Part of the Line of Battle (LoB) series that is the magnum opus of regimental American Civil War systems.  By far the best game at capturing the unique circumstances that was the Battle of Gettysburg.

Takes some getting used to, this one, but once you grok the order system, and probably most importantly the mentality behind the orders, it really starts to shine. Moving and fighting is plain enough.

The July 1 scenarios are quite scripted, but they do replicate the actual situation well.  In addition, they provide an excellent graduated introduction to the game system, because you don't have to grapple with the full complexity of the rules about orders until you've played some turns on "autopilot", especially if you're the CSA player.

This system is nicely streamlined; it plays in much less time than its predecessor, the Civil War Regimental Series.

My 8 plays were all sessions in a single game I played with my son-in-law over a multi-month period.

For an overview of the LoB system, see my review for None But Heroes. In short, it's an excellent tactical simulation of Civil War engagements, with just enough complexity and chaos. The orders system ties it all together for a brilliant experience.

I rate LCV a 10, compared to NbH's 9 for the sheer amount of content. Over 20 scenarios are available, and all of them are playable on one, two or four maps. Of course, playing the full campaign on just the 1st day map, and then trying to move it to the 2nd/3rd day map doesn't make much sense, but the fact is that you can still play some very big scenarios, which make full usage of the orders system, on just a single map. NbH requires both maps for that (I say this for those who are short on space, like I am).

I am having a blast playing a 4 player team game of the Scenario 7.2 Campaign Game on Wednesday evenings. I have also played several of the smaller scenarios included in the game. 

Dean Essig has definitely taken his new Line of Battle game system to yet a higher level of clarity, playability and realism with the release of this game.  This IS American Civil War regimental level gaming at its FINEST. 

Also, the number of map and scenario options available in this game is simply outstanding along with Dean's design notes.

After two plays I have to say this game lives up to the hype. Fast playing and easy to get into if you're used to hex and counter wargames. It's a huge game but an extremely playable one with superb rules. Did I mention that it has 22 scenarios and that you can play the campaign game on two maps?! This game has everything and it's Gettysburg after all so how can you go wrong?

Dean Essig's magnum opus on Gettysburg.  Reached its pre-order target on the day it was released, which was the 150th anniversary of the start of the battle. 

MMP got it published within six months of the game going up for pre-order, arriving in Sydney in January 2014.

I started a solo play of the full battle, mainly to get my head around the constraints the designer has placed on the events of the first morning.  The pacing is great - the Rebels feeling their way forward; the Union cavalry pulling back in good order whilst John Reynolds starts hurrying the infantry forward.

The system is so smooth the game is a pleasure to play.

Just received this, certainly looks good. I have a couple of the older RSS games, and I had a very difficult time grasping the rules. The LOB 2.0 rules seem a lot more straightforward. I doubt I will ever play the full 3 day battle (barring a play through at a Con or a club), but there are a lot of smaller scenarios. Good system for these battles, just be aware that the orders/ command system is very much a 'spirit of the rules' type thing, rather than 'letter of the law'.

Just learning this game & the LoB system.  I like what I see from the LoB system so far. 8/10.

As for the game specific rules, I think the 1st day special rules may be a bit of overkill.  I am also stumped as to how the Union player can prevent the Rebs from capturing Seminary Ridge before the July 1 4:00PM  "deadline", and if the game is worth playing out when that happens.  Hmmmm....

The game seemed very scripted to me after watching calandale's videos on it. He remarked later that one could play it and ignore the scripting rules. I have done that before. I might consider buying the game but I should try GMT's Three Days Gettysburg game first since I have a copy.

This game is broken.  Biggest problem is nonsensical victory conditions that make flanking moves, the Round Tops, Culp's Hill, etc. completely irrelevant.  Plus it does not accurately simulate Civil War tactics or reward proper tactics.

Map and counters look great.  There's room to maneuver around the historical battle sites to allow for Longstreet's flanking proposal, etc.  Looks superb.  I may begin a group play within a couple weeks.

Still unsure about LoB system. Seems a downgrade of CWB/RSS. Some new good ideas with a bad implementation (reserves let you push an attack almost forever regardless of actual losses). 

The more I think about it, the more I feel the game system was reversed (favoured defender became favoured attacker) and all the new rules that made the cut were trying to put back some of the lost balance. Why?

RATING: N/A
Have played the intro scenario a couple of times - solo and ftf - and am beginning the 4 map game.  

Having played TSS (both SPI & TSR) - 5 complete games an numerous aborted/reset starts - and 3DoG - both 2000 and 2004 versions - several times, I am intrigued by the orders system od LCV.  While the 1st day seems closer to a simulation than a game - based on the orders restrictions, I am having a blast so far, even though I am not able to run wild like in the other systems.

Still working the Confederates under Recon In Force restrictions so not ready to rate this game yet but am IMPRESSED so far.

I got this at the flea market at San Diego Historical Game Con last year, oh what a find! I haven’t gotten this to the table yet, but I have gone over the series rules and this looks like a really good game. I enjoy the complexity of Civil War command and control and the chaos of the battle field but most Civil War games don't do it at all or make very complex rules. This game has found a balance, the rules are not over complex but do a very good job simulating the situations commanders of the time faced. I will definitely putting this in the top tier of my games I need to play.

It is definitely another well researched game on Gettysburg. There are some unusual quirks in this one. You do not always see artillery easily lobbing grenades over their own front lines. There are some benefits and some drawbacks in not allowing artillery and infantry to stack. The order system is a love-and-hate affair. The reduced die rolling for combat is welcome, but also generates some results that seem dubious.

At the same time it should be emphasized that it does play easily. There ARE a lot of merits to the game.

Leaders appear overrated. If you have an able leader you are easily able to construct a stack that is virtually unstoppable unless physically shot to pieces. The weakest unit in terms of morale in the hand of the best leader becomes better than the best unit. I am not sure that Hancock would transform the lowliest unit of the XI corps into a unit that is better than the Iron Brigade by mere presence. For some reason leaders in Civil War games are far more important than in any other period of time, apart from major commanders such as Alexander.

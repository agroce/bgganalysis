I like this game a lot.  It reminds me of FUSE because it's easy for new gamers to pick up; its fast and furious; and your team needs to be good at communicating. There is a lot of fun packed into this game in just 5 minutes, and the illustrations are really, really great.

This game is a hoot. I almost didn't back it on Kickstarter, but I enjoyed the punny art style, and folks were going ga-ga over it on BGG, so I took a chance. 

And I'm glad I did. It's a fun game. Everyone I've introduced to it has loved it, win or lose. It's definitely a party game, set in real time, where everyone is throwing down cards like crazy to defeat a stack of minions, obsticles and mini-bosses, before attempting to take down the big bad, all within the course of five minutes.

RATING: 8
A great, quick, easy and fun game that provides an intense level of action. The 5 minute timer mechanic that works well for this co-op game that emphasizes speed over contemplation and is a good start for a game night or if you only have a few minutes to play. 
Replay ability is high even though the content can be complete within a couple of play through as the game's core mechanics maintain the intensity each time you play.
The downside is that the game is balanced for 4-5 players and anything less puts you at a serious disadvantage to advance each dungeon. Additionally, the game is shallow on the skill cap so for in depth experience it is not recommended.
Overall, this game is a great ice breaker and can provide fun for all skill level of  gamers.

2 play-throughs at 2-player and had a great time! A very fun, chaotic 5-minute brain fart-inducing card game. We'll take a few more games before the iconography really sticks allowing us to be more efficient in our plays.

We made It to level 2 in our first play and level 3 in our second, but got demolished in the third round.

Very clever and fun card illustrations and text too, it's a shame you can't fully appreciate them while playing.

If it were stripped of time pressure, 5-Minute Dungeon would be a numbing exercise of drawing and collectively laying down sets of cards.  Extreme time pressure renders that simple task more difficult and lends communication and action a frenetic pace.  I have quite enjoyed a few plays of it.

Production quality is only passable, with slight bowing of the boards in the copy I played, though card quality is decent.  The artwork is generic, cartoony fantasy.

A fast real time co-op that delivers what it promises, well, except for the time stoppage cards (and special power) that can extend the game beyond five minutes, which actually made our game more enjoyable.  One could do a lot worse than this super fast co-op, but then again, this game is just not the kind of game I enjoy.

This has been a great success lately in our group. I really like the mechanics and timer ensures there will not be a alpha-issue like in standard co-ops. 

Just remember to house rule time stop to last until any player does any in-game action and holy hand grenade to not work on bosses.

Got 5 minutes? wanna play a simple game? hold on 10 minutes while I get it out, and another 10 to explain it. Oh and I can't carry it in my pocket/bag because of the box size, so I'm less likely to actually HAVE the game on me when I have 5 minutes & friends ...

While this is a fun game my son does not like the time pressure of 5 minute dungeon.  The card art is humorous, but again, the five minute timer does not allow you time to appreciate the references while you play.

I wasn't impressed that much. It's real-time coop which I tend to like (FUSE, Escape: Curse of the Temple) but this one just was too simple. That doesn't mean it's easy to beat...it's not...but all you're really doing is symbol matching cards in your hand to a monster/obstacle card in the middle. There's some special cards that each character has too along with special powers but overall the game is super samey. It also appears to have some balance issues but I'm not even factoring that into my score since I haven't played it enough. The best part about the game is the vibrant art and funny names on the monsters but you don't even notice them when frantically flipping through the deck.

I bought this game because I wanted something that took 5 minutes for times when we didn't have time for a longer game.  But it turns out we like to play it several times in a row.  We usually play for at least an hour.  It's addictive.

This game is very fast to teach.  I suggest playing the first time without a 5-minute clock though.  At least go through a round.  That makes it much easier to play fast the second time through.

Lots of social interaction.  Simultaneous action.  There is a bit of strategy if you want to get better at it.  We enjoyed talking about how to improve our times between games.  There are several player boards with each one increasing in difficulty.

It plays well with either 4 or 5 (haven't played other numbers.)  Game is a little easier with 5.

My gaming group loves this game and asks to play it regularly.  We play it several times each game night.  So much fun.

They also love the artwork.  We realized we needed to stop and look at the art before playing it again because it's so amusing and well done.

I feel you could set the timer to whatever time you want even though officially it is a 5-minute timer. If you have someone in your group who doesn't know the rules or isn't quick or is anxious, then just set the timer to a higher number.  This has no effect on gameplay.  I've played it with a 7-minute timer and with a 5-minute timer and liked it both ways.  I believe you could also lower the timer to 4 minutes for a tenser game as you get better.

This is a quick dungeon co-op dungeon crawl for up to 5 people that starts out challenging, but very easy to learn and play. As you play more and more difficult bosses, it gets harder and honing team strategies becomes very important. This is not to say the game isn't still accessible. I have mostly played this with gateway gamers, and they loved it. The symbology and presentation work well, and the app is a nice extra touch. 

If you don't mind the timed nature of it, definitely give this one a try.

So. Damn. Good. 
It is not often outside of the end phases of highly strategic messes that you have an actual, visceral, physical reaction to a game. 
This creates it. Something about the magic of a timer makes a game (that has a mechanic so simple a grade-schooler could do it) insanely rewarding and fun. 
On top of that, it is cooperative, so it's good for even your most easily butthurt friends. And it fast, with very little set-up.
Seriously delightful.

Admittedly, after about 10 plays, I think some of the magic would wear off, but for $20, I think that is fair.

This is an awesome exhilarating game. 
We did beat the 5 bosses in our first play, but I have to tell you that we are used to play together in co-ops.
Although you have, every game, the same cards available, you never have the same game, so it keeps you on your tows.
And at the and of your game, you should take a brake for your heart to calm down  and your adrenaline to wear of (hihi). But that is what the game makes fun.
On the contrary of what the game suggests, the game does not take 5 minutes to play. You have 5 minutes to defeat 1 dungeon, with monsters, persons, obstical, mini-bosses and the big boss. But it doesn't stop with 1 Dungeon, and that is the awesome bit. 
If you are able to play the whole game in 1 go, you should count rather 45 minutes. But this is "if you can beat the game".
Good luck, and enjoy !!!!

Need some careful reading about discarded card and  re full hand card size, but after understood it well (I hope) , it is a funny and extremely quick game.
Perhaps the Valkyrie power (discard 3 cards to let other players to draw two new cards) is a little overpowered, but perhaps the only way to surpass quickly nasty minibossses or at least have a chance

Two drawbacks I count for this game:  
1) after you beat the game  once (and in 5 minutes not so easy even with baby barbarian), people don't try usually harder boss, because the 2-3 tries  put a strain on people for the  fast pacing and frenzy to beat deck plus boss
2) The 5 minute app for  Android of this game is insanely charge draining power and causing  a lot of heating for my ASUS zenphone 2 (and i never suffered such problems from  Star Realms or Pinball arcade Apps)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In my experience, this co-op is enjoyed by hardcore gamer groups and non-gamer groups alike.  Hectic fun that rewards the ability to plan and re-plan in an instant as the game throws you curveball after curveball.  Extremely easy to teach but requires a highly coordinated group to beat the highest difficulties.  Not much of a quarterbacking problem since the game moves too fast for any one player to take over.

Have not had the opportunity to play it with more than 2 people.  With 2 people I think the challenge is good and the game is a lot of fun to beat the clock. If you lose, its not a big deal. You just lost 5 minutes!  Play again and lets win.  It becomes clear that stopping time and using abilities can almost break the game.  Its still fun, I like winning!  If I really don't want to take advantage of the mechanics then I would just exclude the wizard or pull the time stop cards.  I can see where the game gets easier with more people as you have more character abilities to quickly resolve the cards.  I still find it fun to find new interesting ways to use players abilities to make card pulling synergies.  

Its easy to teach. 
Its obviously super fast to play.
The app and voices definitely make the experience better.
Everyone is laughing and having a good time.
If you destroy a dungeon in 2 minutes, that's fine, more time to play more rounds!

Won this through a contest put on by BoardGameStories.com. Received on 03/27/17.
Artwork and graphic design is stellar! I've played this with kids and adults, and it's more fun with adults, honestly. Quick thinking and decision making works out well in this game, especially if you have a power that lets you pause time. The more people at the table, the better your chances of winning, even with the higher ranked dungeon bosses. Plus, you need to pass the door cards and mini-boss cards around between rounds, because the humor is lost during the game. Someone had a lot of fun creating this game!

This game excels in what it is made to be,
A short 5 minute easy to learn cooperative team game.
If I were to think of a game to use an introduce a part of board gaming to my friends, this would be it, doesn't take much to set up, best way to get into the game is 0 time spent on explaining and just plunging right in(after telling them to draw cards). The suspense of "5 minutes" will just hook em and they will start learning how to play as the first 5 minute progresses and you experience your first defeat.

However I think that this game is not meant to be played over 2 cycles with the same group(Going through all the same bosses twice), unless your group would like to spice it up and make things harder. Yet, this doesn't make this game unrepeatable, because it will always feel new with different groups. Also good to make them look forward to trying out other new heavier board games in the future.

Definitely think 5 players would be much easier since you have a higher number of cards to burn through, and more options (even though hand count is lower).
Will be playing again. Nice reboot game after a long day of gaming.

Backed on Kickstarter. I am amazed how many design flaws this game has, yet still recieving tons of possitive reviews. I suppose, many people just houseruled it. The art and production is top-notch, but basically everything else is either unclear (manual) or not properly tested (gameplay with various player counts, balance of bosses).
Without BGG FAQ you basically cannot play this game, and even then, it is insanelly hard (I am aware of variable difficulty table in Kosmos release). You may later learn what combination of characters is good and which is useless. I didnt anticipate this is a strategic game of choosing the right character!  (Holy Grenade insta boss-kill anyone?!) I think this game went into production too rushed. For me, big dissapointment.

* Kickstarted! *

Using the timer app, you need to drop the cards in the right sequence to defeat the enemies… but once a card hits the table, it's gone, meaning that you and your fellow players need to watch that you're not running out of the necessary abilities before the end.

PLUS: actually plays in five minutes, easy to grasp
MINUS: not the main game for the night in any way

Very fun cooperative, real-time card game that moves at a frantic pace. I have played with a few different groups and varied player counts and praise is always unanimous. Lots of interaction and laughter.  Kickstarter copy came with top-tier components (linen finish box and player boards) and the art and color text are terrific.  Each round lasts only five minutes but it feels even faster.

Like that it's co-op with a fixed play time.

Would probably get a bit repetitive after several plays though.  Game owner informed me that there is not much replay value; once a group has completed the 5 dungeons, there is little motivation to try again.

Cool artwork.  (I'd be really interested in One Deck Dungeon if the art looked like this instead.)

Dislike that the rules say to play it as a roguelike (returning to level 1 if you fail a level).  Seems like an artificial way to prolong play time if a group is expected to go something like 1-2-3-4x-1-2-3-4-5x-1-2-3-4-5 (rather than 1-2-3-4x-4-5x-5).

I can definitely see other people liking this game, but for me as someone who is not a fan of light real time games I didn't like it. Also, for the genre I think Escape is better because the need to coordinate with moving in different directions and meeting up adds more variety to what your are trying to do, whereas here you are just abstractly playing cards for symbols, and each monster and boss don't really feel different. I also dislike the cleanup time between each dungeon.

A fast cooperative game. The games are supposed to be comprised of 5 levels of 5 minutes each, but the timer can be stopped while the team regains composure and tactics.

I like real-time co-op games, and this one delivers! Great theme, fantastic artwork (love the diversity and women/men split, too), whimsical tone, excellent optional app (love the Scottish narrator!), and holy crap does five minutes go fast. It's intense!

It's quick to learn and teach, too, which helped me get it to the table with my kiddo sooner than Escape (which I also love, but don't think she's ready for just yet). And the bit-sized rounds and flexibility seem like they'll make it easy to bust out in gaps on a game night.

The box is an annoying shape and the cards are a hair on the flimsy side, but the insert is great (a rarity) -- and at this price point I'm not going to quibble too much about the cards, or sleeve them.

I expected to like it, but not as much as I do. A pleasant surprise!

So far, based on two 2-player games, it's punishingly difficult -- but also so quick that it's easy to spin up and try again. We learned tricks to reduce our handling time after each play, too. I suspect having more special abilities, and having more hands to flip cards and move piles, will be big benefits of playing with more than two.

Great co-op speed game. Easy to learn and fun for all to play,  just match the symbols on the monster cards as fast as you can so you can defeat them and move on to the next.  The trick is to communicate and not overplay your hand because once you "play" a card you cannot pick it back up.  My wife even enjoys playing it. It's hard for me to find a game that we both enjoy.  She gets easily frustrated with games that have complex rules. For me, this game has a special spot on our shelf beside ticket to ride,  king of Tokyo,  and hit z road.

Gameplay does not feel well balanced and I'm not sure if the game has enough replay value once you've played through the bosses. After a few rounds you will have seen all the cards anyway, and there's no difference in strategy that you can take as it's all reactive.

Was not sure how this game would hold up with more hardcore gamers. Took the game on a whim to a Descent gaming session and we played it prior to setting up our campaign.  So some serious dungeon delvers taking on 5 minute Dungeon.
Pros
- Easy to teach and jump into
- Fast tempo really makes for frantic nature that has only been captured by a few games before
- Deck variety is noticeable and gives each monster / event it's own challenge level to beat
- Card stock looks like it will hold up well

Cons
- A bit of reset up after each game as cards are shuffled together 
- Challenge level definitely varies with number of players. First game with 3 players we lost to the first boss by 2 seconds.
- Theme / puns on cards are hilarious, but go by so quick you barely notice.

Summary - We started with just three of us. We were making so much noise the host's oldest son came down and wanted to play. Then his youngest son jumped in. Soon we had played through 4 or 5 times and could have kept going.    Both of the other gamers said they would definitely pick up a copy when it hits retail.  So this definitely earns a top spot in my collection for game night starters that people can jump in and out of.    Get it, play it, love it.

Super fun fast paced game. Alright as two player because it felt like if we picked "the wrong characters" that there was no saving us, but I can imagine with a full group you wouldn't have that issue as often. Only other unfortunate thing is that due to how fast you're playing, you don't have time to appreciate the fun artwork! But that's ok, you can just look through them when you're not playing. Overall pretty fun! Cant wait to take on the final boss!

Frantic and addictive! There seems to be some slight balance and scalability issues, luck also seems fairly high, and I have mild concerns with replay-ability, but the pacing is so intense that I don't mind these issues (yet). Also, I enjoy how they did make each character feel somewhat different with the individualized decks and powers.

As of right now, I thoroughly enjoy it, but I can foresee this running out of steam unless they start releasing expansions to add content and fix these small problems.

We LOVE this game.   A great fast game, perfect for kids, and easy to teach!  We have managed to defeat all 7 levels, but barely, and only after a lot of playing and teamwork.  The good news, we can create our own 8th level, and the game plays differently with 2, 3, 4 or 5 players.

RATING: 6.5
My wife really enjoyed this game. It is far less stressful than other real-time games we own (I'm looking at you ESCAPE!). The artwork is awesome but I feel like it may go largely unappreciated as gameplay sends cards flying off the board as quickly as they're drawn. We've only conquered a single dungeon but I am interested to see how 4 dungeons goes. One thing I don't like much is the need for each player to shuffle together 2 different player decks for 2-player games. I would much prefer just reducing the total number of dungeon cards and attacking it using the limited cards in 2 players' deck. This is a minor issue though. I'm still undecided as to whether I prefer card play over dice rolls with these types of games...

Real time cooperative card matching game. It's super accessible to new gamers, the game can be taught in 2 minutes. Serious gamers can find some joy in this too. I wanted to diversify my collection to have games where people can just play, have fun and not worrying about games that are rule heavy. It's a really straight forward game but I think there is still a small element of skill and focus to beat this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A fun co-op card game with an emphasis on communication/negotiation and hand management. It stumbles on player count vs. difficulty. 2 players can tackle the first two bosses...but you need 3 (or 4) players to handle the 3rd boss, and 4 players minimum to take down boss 4 & 5. This isn't true in every case but the point is that the game can't be explored fully with smaller player counts w/o some sort of house-rule. If this issue was corrected it's a 8+ in my book, but as it stands it's an above-average game (still fun though).

Fun silly "React fast" game
Game is much harder with the fewer players you have through and certain characters are just better than others. With only 3 players we were struggling and then when we played 5 players the game got pretty easy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Really fun game, plays super fast with all the craziness of a real time game. Stopping time in this game and organizing who-should-do-what feels strangely “realistic”. Completing a more difficult boss means your team is getting better at playing the game.

Recommended for players that can handle the real time mayhem.

PS: THANKS to anyone behind the cards “one man two bows” and two men one bow. I really LFAO when ecountered them.

I quite enjoyed my plays of this game.  In this game each player is a certain type of fantasy trope hero trying to defeat the BBEG of a dungeon in 5 minutes by playing cards to defeat a series of traps and enemies and finally the boss monster itself.

This game is really tough, I have yet to get past the second floor of the dungeon myself.  It plays really quickly (5 minutes per level in fact, go figure) and is an awesome and easy to pick up filler.  I also enjoy the artwork and love the humor in it.  If you can get the Kickstarter normal shaped box edition you should though.  The retail edition comes in a stupid and hard to store hourglass-shaped box.

RATING: 7
Fast-paced and zany, this is a game that steps up the adrenaline, to the point where many of the gags are missed during gameplay, and you have to go back and revisit the cards played in order to enjoy the humour.  You can tweak the difficulty by selecting which dungeon to play, and of course, there is variability in the different decks.  My son and I typically play 2 player, which means we are allowed to combine two decks into one.
In the hectic race to get through cards, no one bothers to check the rules, so it is possible that a lot of the time, we are breaking the game, but I have the feeling the creators really aren't sticklers, so long as we are having fun.

LOVE THIS GAME ... i purchased the deluxe version on Kickstarter just opened it the other day ...  The kids (and I mean 10 - 16) all love it, I love it... only problem is every second i am home i get harassed to play.  The game is really cleaver and the 5 minutes makes this brilliant, the game is noisy and takes a lot of interaction with the team.  At the end of a few rounds you actually need a breather.. and the furthest we have got is to boss 3, not even half way.   

The instructions are really easy, and it takes no time to learn.  Our 10 year old watched one round and was into it.

tl;dr: all fluff

This is a chaotic, co-op, throw some cards under time pressure game. It's not bad or annoying but the depth is... of an undetectably small amount. Also, we didn't win, but that had nothing to do with our skill. We saved our best cards for the big boss at the end and exhausted all our options. We didn't run out of time, we just didn't get the cards we needed. OK, for a 5 minute game that is not too bad, but still, if you do everything right...
In any case, this is a romp and I guess many people will enjoy this, but I prefer my light games to have slightly more depth. This is all fluff and no substance.

Absolutely bloody brilliant. This game is the hit of my local game society and everyone loves it. Kids and adults alike can join in. Easy to pick up and play but defeating each boss is not guaranteed - fantastic replay value. With fewer players we mix multiple decks as it feels 4 character decks are needed for reasonable play. We also have a house rule for the most powerful card in the game to keep it challenging.

This game provides a perfect warm up for a more in depth gaming night. Not only does the game only take 5 minutes to play, but it only takes about 5 minutes to teach people to play it.

I love the simplicity and really hope to see some expansions come out in the future!

One of the easiest to understand real-time cooperative games. A great game for the non-gaming crowd who likes a short but fun experience. The player and card powers to freeze the clock to talk make this game unique.

Plus the jokes/puns and artwork on the cards are great. Low rating is due to a specific game winning card that makes all the strategy basically "save it and use it on the boss". Will need to play it a few times with that card removed or make it invalid against the end bosses to see if that adds to the challenge.

I have the "Print & Play" version via Kickstarter and I'm super disappointed because they chose not to include ANY card art at all.  So I paid for a PnP that boils down to an alpha set on index cards.  I understand WHY they don't want to include art in a PnP but it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. Given the lack of any card art I'm not really motivated at all to actually print this game out or try playing it.  I feel like I've been suckered.

Played a friend's copy. Has issues with difficulty being heavily dependent on player count (more=easier), but it doesn't matter really - because each boss is limited to 5 minutes, the amount of frantic fun packed into those 5 minutes just leaves you wanting to play again and again (even against the nigh impossible, at least at 4 or less players Final KS boss).

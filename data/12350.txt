Interesting game on the border of boardgaming and roleplaying. Very flexbile, a lot of scenarios, many possible actions, feeling of adventure well implemented. The art and quality is below average, only "functional". Huge rulebook and pretty hard to know where to start and what to do (it's structured but in a very strange way).

RATING: 10
The game I would've wanted when I was a kid -- so kewel to have such detail onboard the ships.   Very nicely designed and with lots of rich gameplay. It's a brilliant, elegant system that cleverly realizes its sci-fi theme.

Just to lend credence to my praise of this beautiful game, I'll mention a few warts.... There is this impression that some roles (like the Engineer) don't do much, and are largely limited to just running from engine to engine;  however, I think there's more than enough to the game to overlook that.  Getting up to speed in the game does take some time;  the system is simple but certainly not simplistic.  Games can take awhile, and there should be many, many more scenarios available for it.  Also, the game is referee'd, which seems to be almost mandated by the theme, however, being the referee isn't everyone's idea of fun.  (It works for me because I get to throw different things at my kids to see how they'd react while enriching their gameplay -- they feel like they're living an episode of Star Trek!)

Another thing to comment on is the rulebook.  We just love reading this thing;  we may have to order another copy before this one wears out!  I can't imagine the amount of work that went into creating this game and distilling it into this rulebook.  Yet, in some sense the rulebook "fails" the game -- it seems like there's lotsa little details scattered throughout that I'm never quite certain we've incorporated everything as we play.

This "rulebook failure" is compounded by the expansions:  If you can appreciate the game for its depth of play, its creativity, the sheer fun of it, then you'll have to own every expansion.  But there's the problem:  The game has evolved, with new skills, abilities, just tons of new stuff to the point it can be very difficult to know whether you're playing it right.  

So there's no way to understate it:  Battlestations demands a very real commitment.  Not so much in time to play it, but time to understand and digest all the rules.  But there's simply no denying this game the perfect 10 it so richly deserves.

We play with Lego mini-figures for our characters, and the game just seems to be made for that!  The scale is about right (in a cartoon-y sorta way) and the kids really get into moving and posing their doods as they move them around.

A sure sign of this game's success is the mission log that my 12 yo is dutifully keeping.  Each mission plays out as a chapter in their characters' lives, and usually there's a few highlights that make the mission log.  E.g., in the last mission, my 9 yo accidentally grenaded his older brother, knocking him unconscious!

RATING: 8
It has some flaws (typos, mediocre bits) yet the game manages to capture the Star Wars vibe that made millions of people fall in love with that series of movies before George Lucas went nuts.  Plus the creators managed to successfully merge two disparate game types (RPG and Board Games) into one successful offering.  This game is going to be played in heavy rotation in our game group.

It makes a monthly appearance at our weekly game night.  It's been great fun whenever we've played.  A good blend of roleplaying and boardgaming without some of the heavier, more tedious aspects of both. 

We have the added benefit of an experienced referee which makes the game quite enjoyable.

There is a good game in here, but it could use some streamlining. We played a mission in which there were traitors, so it started as a fight between non-combat PCs and combat NPCs, so that when we got to the space combat our ship and crew were in a bad state. Perhaps another scenario would have been better.

Wow. It really works. The bits, though cardboard, are quite durable. Needs a better hexmap... oh so badly!

But fun: it's really a light roleplaying game with a strong board system, rather than board-game with roleplaying overtones.

I love the theme of this game.  The game itself is a rich RPG/Boardgame hybrid where players get a chance to create their own unique hero and watch them either shine or fail through various encounters (although I usually play with pre-made characters for my group).  Just don't get scared off by the rulebook or prep work, as the game is really much simpler than it first appears.

I enjoyed playing and being smashed.  I was surprised by how reliant the game was on a good roll of the dice (you can't be Scotty if you are always rolling threes when you try to pump the engines).  One bad roll can seriously damage your options for an entire round.

RATING: 4
Tentative rating after one play.

Not for casual play.  There's a lot there, and much to absorb.  My feeling was that the scope was to large for what I was ready for.  It's both a light RPG, and a tactical space combat game.  I think that you need to immerse yourself in the game to get the most out of it, and I'm not ready to do that.

I wouldn't call this a RPG/Boardgame... I'd say it's more like a board game with a lot of flavor.  It sort of finds a sweet spot that gamers will be happy with, and Role-players will feel is lacking (which, is good, because I don't want to play with black trench coat wearing middle-aged men who need a hair cut and a shower).

RATING: 6
Battlestations has a simple idea, but plenty of chrome (rules, special powers, equipment). One nice aspect is that first time players are limited in what they can do, so complexity builds. A novel concept that looks good.

Lower the rating as a stand alone game (5-6). You need a campaign for full value. If you are more into the role playing aspect, or a campaign, the rating goes up. 

With a bit of work, it soloes fairly nicely, although you'll never be surprised by a scenario...

It takes about two hours of playing before the rules feel comfortable.  Individual rules are easy to understand, though: some aspects of the rulebook layout confused me, there are a few details the rulebook doesn't cover, and the rules are a bit fiddly (so remembering them all at the same time can be hard).  There's lots of fun in acting up your characters (ala an RPG).  I wouldn't recommend this for a one-off game or for just two players; it has so much more potential as a campaign with a team (and their ship) growing in abilities.  Finally, the different player professions are not all as fun because many missions are heavily balanced towards one or professions.

So close to playing!  Looks like fun, but then reading the rulebook becomes daunting about halfway through.  It's kind of like an RPG, but since it is a boardgame, you can't really fudge the rules like an RPG, so there is an added level of stress.  Too little like Warhammer Quest in Space, and too much like GURPS:Space Boardgame.

Great co-op game with simple, but detailed rules that lets you shoot for the stars and feel like you are in one of the space adventure movies while doing it. It's a boardgame with rpg lite flavor. If you are not laughing and making movie comments then you are not playing it right. I started playing with my sons(9,10, and 12), they picked up the basics really quick, they still ask to play at least twice a week.

It takes some work to get through the rulebook, and not everyone is going to enjoy this type of game, but if you like Science Fiction and RPG like games, you cannot go wrong with Battlestations.  The first couple of times it can be slow to get going as people are learning the rules.  But with repeated plays it certainly speeds up.

Soooo much to love.  The perfect rpg/boardgame hybrid.  Really not that hard to play and LOTS of fun.  The game excels at portraying chaos in a very fun and managable manner, and even makes dying seem not so bad.  If you're one of those weirdos that prefers pseudo science and men standing around talking to just accepting that a lightsaber WORKS because someone turned it on, then you should check out the Pax Galacticum expansion.  It's not fair to say the fun has been removed, but most of the combat has and the chaos now stems from scientific and diplomatic misunderstandings.

One of the most magnificent things i've discovered in this hobby.  I stumbled upon it at a convention, in it's giant-sized form, run by the designer himself.  Bought the rulebook immediately.  Began running a Firefly-themed version of our own design at home (only way to get some of my group to bite on it).  Part board game, part RPG, all fun.  Updated edition coming Fall 2017!

I found this a real challenge to learn.  The rules were not painful to read, but the organization of key elements could be improved.  Pretty brilliant ideas here.  It feels like you really have to focus on pacing when running this game or it will bog down and bore some of the players.

Great Game. Boardgame with level mechanic to make the game different each time you play. Can run about 2 hours so be prepared for that.  I wish cloning was removed to dying a little more serious of a condition but nothing that can't be housed ruled (like the unsinkable special ability). At the end of the day this the finest sci fi boardgame and probably one of the better overall games on the market.

I was fooled into purchasing this by the positive reviews here, many of which turned out to be the designer and his buddies.  Crappy role-playing game masquerading as a board game; effectively "Warhammer Quest" in space (except bad).  This game feels like it was written 20 years ago and ignored game development since then.  

What a disappointment.  When I buy a board-game, I want a board game.  If I'm playing a role-playing game, I'm going to play something with a decent modern rule set.

Problem exacerbated by mediocre editing, terrible art, mediocre production values.  Obviously the work of amateurs.  The whole thing feels like something slapped together by my buddies.

At first it was a just curiosity- a simple game with weird missions and weak art in its first edition. But slowly I grew to enjoy my copy (purchased for VERY low sum at a gaming event), and then I met Jeff Siadek, who is one of the most amazing and dedicated game designers I've ever met. He has an acerbic wit that takes getting used to, but he has grown to become a great friend and an incredible resource to my own game designs. And Battlestations has grown in my mind as a result.

This game is truly infinitely expandable and allows for almost any decision you want to make. Technically you could fail the mission entirely and go off, exploring the outer reaches of space or land your craft on alien worlds depending on the expansion books you own. But the focus is on organizing your team to get around the ship and interact with other ships and even solve mysteries that don't require combat skills at all.

As far as I can tell, it also was the basis for the video game FTL, and even that game doesn't hold a candle to what Battlestations is capable of. I have become such a fan that when Jeff flattered me by inviting me to create a mission for the game I ended up getting involved to produce Second Edition, using my favorite artists and adding plastic 1 inch minis. So full disclosure I am pretty much obsessed with the game. ;)

RATING: 7
This is a fun game, although *very* scenario dependent. The suggested starter ones (the duel, boot camp) are lame and not that fun - nothing to do for the science officer. Played Terrorist Cruise Liner recently and that worked much better.

The "gotcha", and the reason I can't rate the game a little higher, is the lack of decent player aids. Battlestations is just complicated enough, with peeking and popping and grenades and such, that a good player aid with a list of actions is really vital (this game really would have benefitted from some screw-tightening and simplification, as well as a more coherent rulebook). There are quite a few *almost* good aids here on the 'Geek, but nothing quite right for casual/first-time players.

Anyway. Battlestations is much more of medium-weight RPG than a boardgame, and as such it can be a lot of fun with a good mission, or a little dull with a boring one, and having the right referee who can keep things moving and make quick rulings on rules is important. Typically the game should go 3 hours for a middling-complexity mission once at least the referee sorta knows what he's doing, but it can get bogged down. 3 hours is OK, but you wouldn't want it going too much longer than that. The big tip for players: there are times when you are going to be passing or preparing; you aren't going to be doing something cool every phase. You need to learn to think in terms of what you are going to be doing this round, instead of each phase, so you can move quickly through the phases where you are moving from place to place, preparing, or passing.

This is definitely an "experience" game. While it should be simpler, and the rulebook is awful, it's no worse than Descent or anything else by FFG, and it finishes more quickly  - combat is much more lethal. And it's much more effective in terms of getting you into the sci-fi atmosphere. While wouldn't disagree with many comments posted here by the lower raters, the game works well for me.

Outstanding space crew simulation that can pack some seriously intense moments.  Really enjoy the campaign play and linked missions using the same crew.  The rules are solid and not too confusing but may be difficult for someone who has never played an RPG before to understand.  However, the game does not require that you enjoy RPGs to have fun, as it sits firmly on the board game side of the spectrum.

My only complaint thus far is that there are moments where the game can be a bit slow and plodding.  However, when it's on - it's definitely on.  The components are not exceptional either.

Really a great game, and for those who shy away because of the RPG-elements... not more as an in Doom or Descent or in most of the other campaign games. The rules are fairly easy to learn, and not all must be known by all players right from the start. Expect lots of fun.

I played one mission where four of us were pitted against four NPCs in ship vs. ship combat.  We got the crash course on the battle system, which was a little unnerving since I'm not used to playing dice-heavy games in which I don't know the rules well.  (The games I've played are either simple enough that a quick rules explanation will suffice, like Heroscape, or complicated enough that I've pre-studied the rules, like tabletop RPGs.)  However, the GM did a good job at giving us ideas for what we could do without pushing us into anything.  Since this was a quick, battle-happy session, I don't know what else I can say.  There's enough going on in this game that I *would* want to look at the rules in advance if I were to play it again.  The boxed set looks like a pretty good deal for the many bits that are included, plus the handbook.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Those who like Space Hulk will like this one.  The rules allow for RPG variances with standard actions.  Sadly, this means you are at the mercy of whatever the GM thinks is possible (and what is not).  Of the demos I played of this, the GM decided the players didn't need to know their options and consequences beforehand, which distracted from the game.  Perhaps just a bad GM experience, but an official demo I should assume is a typical experience, yes?

Fun pseudo-rpg set in space.  Played this at GenCon SoCal with the creators and had lots of fun.  It's going to be tough to play a lot, though, I think, because with my RPG group we play games like Dungeons & Dragons or Call of Cthulhu.  With my boardgaming friends, we usually play stuff like Age of Steam and Power Grid.  So, it's going to be a niche thing.  I was actually thinking of using the basic rules to play games in the Serenity/Firefly universe, and I think it would work very well for that.  I had enough fun, though, that I'll definitely play it some and don't want to get rid of it.

Amazing theme, perfect amount of self-awareness in what is fundamentally a very silly game world. The concept is one of my all-time favorites, but the gameplay just bogs down so, so badly with every single turn requiring rules checking, bookkeeping, tons of fiddling with components (this missile moves here at this speed, this ship turns at this rate this turn, but next turn we'll have to get this much engine power devoted to slowing down, etc.). The end result is a game I want desperately to fall in love with but that makes itself so difficult to actually play as to only get pulled out on special occasions. I think a lot of this comes from the fact that it's billed as a board game when it is far closer to a full-fledged RPG that happens to come with some board components.

The description of the rating sums it up nicely, I will never turn down a game of Battlestations.  The combination of ship to ship and intraship activity is what makes this one special, in my opinion.  Each member of the crew feels as if they contributed to the success of a mission, be they Marine, Scientist, Engineer, or Pilot.  The underlying system is simple enough there is little need to reference the rules during play, but the variety of possible actions allows a crew multiple paths to victory.  I can see where the time investment could be a turn off to some (a mission will likely take 4 hours), but is not an issue for me.

I Love this game... I have bought so many expansions for it and the Minis.  The reason i can't give it a higher rating is that i can't find anyone to play it with.  Most RPG players want something less boardgamey and don't see this as an epic RPG, they see board constraints.  It seems to be a bit too much for the average board gamer, and they usually have the option to role play (highly encouraged) but they try to strategize and not try to get into character.  You really need people who love both worlds like i do.

This game is a perfect mix between tactical board game and simple roleplaying game. The elegance of the rules provides the foundation for tremendous depth of possibility that draw players in to immersive, imaginative fun. This is especially true with the How Much For Your Planet expansion.

The player community is also very helpful, friendly, and excited about the game even years after release, probably since the developers are still very involved in continually making it great along with engaging the fan base on a personal level. While it's a great game in its own right, the friendliness and availability of the community and developer is priceless.

I love Battlestations. It does an awesome job of balancing boardgame, RPG, and fun. We're about to start what will be my second campaign with this group: Pax Galacticum. I have a box-load of painted minis for the guys, but haven't had a chance to seal them yet.

I dig this game immensely!  Coming from a long history of GMing RPGs my whole life, this was a natural fit for me, and the groups I usually play boardgames with love the cooperative, action packed fun this game provides. 

Each mission is a madcap race, wherein failing can sometimes be more fun than succeeding! The stories that are created from each mission are hilarious!

For a RPGer like me that game is almost perfection; not really fond of the game universe  (though there are a nice bunch of good ideas) mostly because the weird humour in it; with very little tweaks you can play Star Trek or even Star Wars (the system is nearer Sar Trek, i think); actually i play a little adapatation of Wedon's Firefly 'verse.

More like an RPG with boards to play on than a board game. The beginner mission was decent but I think the later missions should be more involved. Very wacky aliens.

RATING: 8
Fun, lighthearted, sci-fi RPG as a boardgame. You can select your class and race, set some attributes, and gain experience, prestige and items. Then you get sent off on missions by a referee who is also working against you.

I imagine this is the sort of game that will appeal to BSG or Space Alert fans. There are quite a few rules, so you will need a dedicated person to ref the games. But, if they know it well, they can hide the complexity from the rest of the group so that they can Just Play.

Update: Kickstarted the upcoming 2nd edition.

This is a great game, although I can't really categorize it.  It's not totally an RPG, because it is episodic.  It isn't a spaceship sim because of the importance of characters.  If you want to play an RPG, but traditional storytelling types like DnD are too foreign, this is the perfect type of game.  And if you like Star Trek, you need to play it.

RATING: 7
I really want to enjoy this game.  The concepts are great, but there's some flaws that prevent it from coming out often.  Play space is one big one.  You've got a galaxy map, and at least 2 normal games worth of space taken up by separate ship layouts... THEN you add in a decent sized sheet or card for every player and controlled enemy in the game.  You need an arena to play the game, and setup takes a while.

From a gameplay point of view, I'm crazy in love with the idea of gameplay on two different levels taking place, and the design is well done in that regard.  My big problems are the luck points.  If you play a game with 5 people, everyone can force a reroll at least a handfull of times... damn near guaranteeing nothing severe can happen to the players.  It's not just a difficult to challenge the players without completely outnumbering them, it's damn near impossible.

With some house rules, and a regular gaming group carrying a campaign, I imagine this could be really fun.  It just hasn't lived up to the concept for me yet.  (I do love the consistent use of colors to depict job related actions and locations throughout the whole game)

The action is interesting enough, and the cooperative style is fun... But the low production value of this game, in the age of lots of plastic and mounted boards, makes me hesitate.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Tentative rating after one learning game. 

Cooperative games are tough to rate, and Battlestations could fall on either side of the fence. It could be an epic experience of a board/RPG game hybrid, but could also fall into a trap of roles. In our game, the roles of pilot, scientist, engineer, and soldier did a very limited amount of actions, and we didn't really break out of our assigned molds. While this can be fun for a game, I'm not sure it can hold up long-term. 

I hope that with experience and gaining skills/stat upgrades the game play is less defined. This would make the game more interesting on a campaign level.

I had fun playing it, but there were still a few things niggling in the back of my mind that further play should answer.

I feel that this light RPG is simple and comprehensive for the space setting. It is my favorite RPG. It has rules for everything I would want to do in a sci-fi setting. Players use their skills to help complete the mission through the medium of their ship. The sense of teamwork players get from surviving a mission makes the game very fun to play. 

I haven't played this game for several years, but man is it fun. I wish I could play it right now. 

I wish it was a little more streamlined and didn't use the grid or hex maps, I would prefer something like the LoS system in Tannhauser, that makes movement and LOS easy, but that's my only complaint.

As the producer of the game, you may take my rating with a grain of salt.  But here is why I give our game a 10:
I still jump at opportunities to play.  After all this time I still keep old characters that I've run at conventions, just in case.  In case of what, I don't know.
Dan Hamilton did a phenomenal job on the illustrations and Todd Boyce did an amazing job on the starship tiles.  Jeff Siadek did a great job on the rules, and I worked very hard to make this a game that I wanted to play.  I hope you enjoy it!

This is really an RPG.  A referee is required to "run" the "modules", characters "level up" with experience points.

RATING: 6
This is a light role playing space combat game where each player takes the role of a crew member aboard a starship.

The Damage allocation system is interesting, damage being assigned to the various modules based on the direction from which the hit/missile came from, then penetration damage is spread across other modules in a straight line (except for missile hits which are represented by damage to adjoining modules instead).

I also liked the idea of allowing the players a free reroll when doing a skill check in their specialization.

On the negative side, the game can get repetitive, as one continuously moves between stations.  This also negatively impacts the speed of the game.

The rules contain some inconsistencies and some abilities/actions may be misleading because flavor text was used.

This one came close to an '8', but for the above reasons a '6' is more appropriate.

As one of the playtesters, I heartily recommend this game!  It's a very good cooperative game in which the players have to work together to achieve common goals.  Lots of tense, nail-biiting decisions as the players figure out how big of a risk they want to take to accomplish their goals.  It has the fun of piloting a starship without all the excess math that can bog down gameplay.  Great fun!

Not the best RPG/Boardgame Hybrid I've seen.  The components were pretty awful and the rules were the opposite of streamilined/elegant (i.e. clunky/fiddly).  I once heard an interesting game theory called the "two minute" philosophy.  As it goes, all games when distilled down to their basic mechanics are exactly two minutes of fun and how well those two minutes are mutated and stretched while being varied is how good the game actually is.  Battlestations most definitely has its two minutes but it stretches them way too long and leaves gaps inbetween.

RATING: 3.5
For reference, I've played through half the Deep Ones campaign, the majority of the Egg Sac campaign, and two or three stand-alone missions from the core book. I've played as a player and the GM numerous times. And... it's just not that fun. I like the flavor and concept of the game, however, the rules and missions are simply not thought-out in most cases.

The players will attempt to make progress with their ship and characters, only to be destroyed by some cheap rule in the next mission. In the campaigns, the players are given different ships or their ship blows up so frequently that there's no reason to care about their primary vessel.

Stategy-wise, the game's not great either. In early missions with a small, under-powered ship, the best strategy is to board the enemy ships as fast as possible. With a bigger ship, it's better to just blow the other ships away. There are a lot of missions have extremely tedious objectives as well. For example, in a mission from the Egg Sac campaign, there's an anomaly with six individual targets flying away from it that each need to be shot from their six different sides. Not my idea of fun.

I thought I'd really like the system going into it, but there are too many problems. The books are chock full of typos and errors. Like rolling on a 66d6 chart that's missing a couple dozen results. Or referring to page "XXX" for more information in a book without lettered pages. After 20+ missions played, I can safely say this game is not for me.

The game is proving to be a good time!!  Have to iron out some of the rules for play...but seems very promising for a better score after some more play!  Having everyone inolved for a common goal is really a neat attraction for the game.  Much lighter than TRAVELLER and has a nice visual board for play.  Components are very nice and should last a lifetime.  
Be careful cutting out the characters.  As suggested on the website, score the lines before cutting.  Take a look at the official site to get an idea of how the cut-outs fit together!!!!

Game is designed in the Dungeonmaster/team format, and I must admit it does it's job successfully. I'm not a scenario game fan but I wouldn't mind being part of a round of Battlestations when asked. Amazing amount of detail makes the game hard to teach, but once learned it replaces any need to ever RPG again. I hope this starts a trend toward making adventure gaming more 'adventurous'. Large manuals and in depth (not complicated) rules make it not for the faint of heart but those that brave it will be rewarded with a fun and deep experience.

In Battlestations, 1 player acts in the role of GM and controls aliens, enemies and any suprises that will come up. The other players take the role of starship crew. Players will first build a ship with various tiles. Each tile represents a different location on a ship, such as a bridge, engine room, torpedo room, teleporter room, etc. Players can go to the appropriate room to take the designated action. At the same time, the game is played on a 2nd board representing the space around the ship. The game is played in scenarios. The goal of the game is to complete the scenario specific mission. The crew will win, as a team, if the scenario goals are accomplished.

A boardgame that is disguised as an RPG where players choose a character and role in part  cooperation of a spaceship that must complete it's mission.  It's much like playing a Star Trek crew member with a mission run by the GM.  There are lots of fiddly little rules and exceptions, so knowing the rules book is really helpful in speeding the game along at a good pace to minimize downtime.

Battlestations: Second Edition! Tabletop Starship Simulator preordered via Kickstarter. Estimated delivery: Jan 2017  Game arrives: July 2017, six months late.

Definitely a niche game that will not appeal to all.  It takes the right group because it is does require cooperation to do well, and there is the temptation to just do your own thing.  (A certain engineer can't wait to leave his post and jump into a boarding missile!)  Not a game to take seriously due to the almost Cosmic Encounter-ish alien races one can play in your multi-species crewed ship.  It does have some clever mechanics (like the ship-to-ship combat system) and I really like to act as pilot.  Very dice heavy, but lots of re-roll opportunities to smooth out the worst luck most of the time.  Five players, with one acting as GM is the sweet spot, and I think it would repay an investment in time for the campaign.  Still a game I keep coming back to, though, when the opportunity arises.

Simultaneous Ship to Ship Combat and Boarding Action simulator with light role-playing.
"You and your friends each play the role of a crew member on a starship that faces whatever grief the referee throws at you. You'll blast enemies, pull outrageous maneuvers, unlock the secrets of alien cultures, and crank the last bit of juice out of an overtaxed engine while trying not to get yourself, your crew, or your starship blown to bits in the process."

A chockful of great ideas, charmingly presented and, sadly, dragged down by the clunkiest set of rules I've come across for quite a while. This swamps all the good stuff with an unnecessary procedural complexity, so that a game that lasts for 5 hours will contain as many interesting decisions as a game of Taluva (20 minutes) or a game turn of Starcraft.
Could have been a classic if subjected to any development at all.

2-8p, 160 m.  Sci-fi roleplaying.  I generally don't like dice-fest roleplaying games and this is no exception.  Thankfully, this one is light enough, and the theme attractively applied, so I will play it if it is the only game in the room.

I bought Battlestations as a structured, less time consuming alternative to a full role playing game that works well with children. Battlestations succeeds in this role.  Battlestations is a light-hearted, fast-paced game and needs to be approached as such. It has a strong space opera style feel that works well in a short 2 to 3 hour game. See my full review for more details http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/1251094

A little bit boardgame, and a little bit RPG; perhaps not perfectly filling for someone hungry for either. Great space opera theme, cooperative, plays best with one player filling the GameMaster Role, humorous artwork and rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Large time investment, little return.  Lots of downtime (with my group, anyway), and when it's your turn your character often has nothing to do.

Not enough story or plot in any given mission to make it feel like an RPG instead of yet another boring co-op--a type of game I am not fond of.

But enough of the sentence fragments.  For me, Battlestations falls into the "I want to like it, but I just don't" category.

That said, if you like co-ops, check this one out.  It doesn't suffer from the "one player runs the show" problem that many co-ops have, and unlike Arkham Horror player actions matter to the outcome.  The theme is strong.  Gamers with a more social bent than I have may also enjoy it--my downtime may be your opportunity for table talk.

Currently after 1 play I am not very impressed. I expect this will go up after additional plays however. I think I tried to do the mission in the incorrect order which lead to there being no chance of success.

Zie het maar te overleven. Iedere speler kan als bemanningslid een eigen "ras" kiezen met verschillende sterke/zwakke punten. 1 speler is de "gamemaster" en speelt de aanval van de Aliens.

A star trek like board game.  With ship to ship combat and light role playing.  Every one gets to be involved in the combat so no one gets bored.  The pilot controls the ship. the scientist scans, gets target locks, operates defensive countermeasures, operates the teleporter, and programs the hyperdrive.
The engineers keep busy working the engines for more power, rerouting power to needed areas (helm, cannons, shields), and performing repairs.
Marines do the fighting with onboard cannons, missle bays, and also by teleporting to enemy ships, or by launching themselves in boarding torpedos, or if needed fight off enemy boarders that find their way onto the ship.

It's great to see a successful RPG/Board game hybrid.  Especially a sci-fi game.  Roleplaying, Equipment, Missions, Ship Battles, Exploring, Hand to Hand fights, Humor, Variable Characters, Character Advancement, Boarding Parties, Campaigns and the list goes on.  Lots of great stuff and very customizable in that RPG way.  My only complaint is I thought the layout of the books could have been better.  I even had some fun with this solitaire.  Ultimately, I'd rather just play Traveller - but if I had the right group this could really be a long playing hit.

Traded.

An older unrecorded play. More of a rpg system than a board game. Love the theme, and the IDEA of most of it, but the experience felt like it bogged down in the minutiae of needless rules about piloting and braking the ship, space combat, etc. I would love a space-themed Trek/Star Wars style rpg where players can explore, fight, and experience a Space Opera universe. I am just not sure this is that experience.

It's rules are intimidating (106 A4 page rule book!) and sometimes disappointingly vague, it's components are lacking shine with card-stand minis and there's also not enough of anything... and it takes a frightful amount of time to play.

Despite this it's kind of fun when you get it running. It's just a shame it doesn't feel 'complete' as is, and requires pooling together resources like spaceship miniatures, crew miniatures and other things to really get the game on its feet!

I'd define it as more of a RPG kit rather then an actual board game.

8.5 based on 1 play. This reminds me a lot of Descent, although BattleStations is a little less accessible. This is partly because of the lower production values but the main reason is because of BattleStations large number of reference charts. Descent just seems ot be a neater and easier to learn system. Having said this, whats not to love about BattleStations mix of ship-to-ship combat at a ship level and crew level? Some of the rules are a bit quirky (you slow down in space unless you speed up - since when did space become "sticky"), but I love any game that allows you to play soccer with a live grenade or to climb into a missile and launch yourself at an enemy ship.

RATING: 7.5
This game is:

A) Well supported, with quality pewter minis, expansions, files, and tons of scenarios.

B) Doing something new and innovative, and doing it very well (space combat + crew activity + roleplaying).

C) Campy old-school space opera, with cheesy and cool aliens and gadgets.

I have a harder time recommending it to a general BGG audience than I do to my D&D group. I think it will appeal to both with mind-expanding drugs.

Not a bad game overall, right now it is rated high because I have a strong desire to play it again, the replay value seems to be good, I have the expansion (Galatic Civil War) and it comes with so many different games to run that we should not lack for things to do on rainy afternoons.

RATING: 7.5
Feels like a blend of rpg and board game. Can be played as a series of space adventures where heroes are sent out to a mission. No beaming down on a planet though, all the action takes place in space - on the heroes ship, spacewalking or abroad of an enemy ship/freighter/some space station. The action takes place on two scales: on hexmap where ships can engage in space combat and simultaneously on the ship´s deck where characters can move around and take actions and engage in tactical combat if the situation calls for it. I find the simulation level to be a bit too high though, there are a lot of things to keep track of and spend time on. The game does not have very complex rules, but it definitely has a lot of them and it needs a lot of commitment from players, especially from the referee. But still there are lot of fun and unique situations to experience in the game.

First Edition - Opened but unpunched.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game would be a ten if it were designed better. The rule books are organized poorly and there isn't enough unification of the rules. You have to flip all around to look up anything (thank goodness for the online resources). Only about a third of the scenarios are worth playing in their default state. 

The creator keeps changing his mind on the rules and plans to make yet another revised edition and go back to original rulings. This gives the impression that the game is still beta. A work in progress. While this is frustrating, it is quite playable. I just wonder if it should have been published after more testing and feedback.

The game can be a bit fiddly and be a table hog. It would be nice to have one rule book for everything and one scenario book. Right now everything is spread out over several books in various states of revision. There are lots of rules questions but the creator is quick to answer.

Despite the negatives mentioned the game can be quite fun, even solo. Great stories can come out of a session. This game falls short of greatness due to the shortcomings mentioned above, but its still a good game if you are willing to invest the time to learn it well. 

It's EXTREMELY important that the Referee know the game inside and out before playing, otherwise it will fall flat quickly with the other players. Also don't play the game without the first supplement book, Galactic Civil War. It makes the game better.

oh and my wife hated this game, She thought being water boarded might be more entertaining. I blame the simple scenario we played. Don't play the simple scenarios they are boring indeed.

When a session of this game comes together it can be a great experience. Care must be taken before introducing it to people.

A really appealing game, but I nedded quite some time to get around the rules. By first two plays didn't went to well but I blame that my no so perfect preperation. You sure need to know the rules by hard, use the rule to speed up the npc turn and you should explain all the actions available thoroughly. Otherwise the gameplay will drag a bit and it will feel all a little fiddly since your character can do only minor tasks sometimes. Apart from that I really like the setting and the concept.

Played three player with three characters each, and it was a fine bit of fun, though perhaps a little too light in the decisions and flavor for a game of this length.  I kept thinking it would be better if they could figure out how to boil it down a bit to make a simpler, shorter game with the same (neat) ideas.  

Of course, this kind of "experience" game is less and less my bag lately, whereas I used to love Magic Realm and be up for Source of the Nile most any time.

I'm also concerned that the game would be lots less fun at one character per player.  LOTS.

Hmm, I have a sneaking suspicion that this wee little RPG sneaked into BGG!

Update:
Took over two years to hit the table but it was worth the wait. Requires a GM who has read the rules (which could use some reorganising) but the game is essentially an RPG-style campaign. Players create their characters (class, race, stats) and go on GM-run space missions.

Turns tick along fairly quickly once you get the hang of how things work. You're essentialy a battleship crew trying to tweak the ship and movements to achieve missions. Die rolling is simple: 2d6 against target difficulty minus any stats and bonuses.

Missions ran the gamut from boring to bloody insane. There is little downtime but sometime characters really have nothing to do. This is where the RPG aspect falls down a little: characters are really limited by what they can achieve especially since movement is limited and time in the game is previous. If a pilot dashes away from the helm to help repair an engine, you can't avoid missiles. If you're human pilot, expect to take ages to get anywhere! ETc. Still, good fun.

The initial box I got (second priting I guess, the manual is version 1.1) had pretty lousy bits in it. And then a plug for the producers website to get pewter minatures... this feels like they're making you buy the bits seperately...

RATING: 9.5
Fun! A good blend of boardgame/RPG with the space theme well-implemented, though the scale is more "Firefly", "Andromeda" or "Blake's 7" than "Star Trek".  Rulebook is nicely illustrated with a glossary/index in the back that enables fast rule-checks.  Rules are a little complicated, but play is straightforward with the assistance of some of the play aids here and at the Yahoo group.  The double-sided board tiles are good, but the cardboard figures provided are disappointing with no variety (some miniatures are sold separately). Good support online (FAQs, play-aids, etc.), looking forward to the expansions.

RATING: 8
The BEST sci-fi RPG/boardgame hybrid.  Works great for a short campaign with your RPG friends or with your board game friends.  Role-playing elements are minimized so as not to scare board gamers.  The space combat and boarding rules work extremely well to create fun and tense battles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Too much of a roleplaying game for me.  It reminds me of a combination between "The Awful Green Things from Outer Space" and "Star Trek: Starship Tactical Combat Simulator".  The lead figures are cool.  There's a lot of dice rerolling!  I'd suggest at least two characters per player, although I think I'd rather just play ICE's SpaceMaster under a knowledgeable GM.

Good: High replay value, continuing characters is a great idea, good combat, good problem solving.

Bad: Game can be slow in places.

Bottom Line: Not a party game or casual game, as a adventure game that's meant to be replayed, the game is superior to anything on the market.

From a game designer standpoint, allocation of crew to tasks is a major resource to manage.  From a "We're running a warship" perspective, I wonder whatever happened to the tradition of having two guys on each duty station who can do the job.

Interesting RPG / wargame. The theme feels a little light as the races feel tacted on and not developed, although I only played a little demo game. Also, there are a ton of actions you can do, but most of them are needlessly complex. Plus, all the dice rerolling makes the game longer than it should be. I think if they came out with an updated streamlined rules edition this game would be better, but from my demo play it is merely average.

How many good things can I say about this game?  Well for starters even though my gaming crew from Savannah, GA aren't anywhere near me anymore except one, the two of us and his girlfriend have been able to really enjoy what little of this we can play.  I like the intensity created in that "what do I do next" feeling of the game as well as the "rpg" portion of it by seeing our characters grow.

I just want more people to play this with!

Great, flexible game that is pretty easy to learn and is adaptable.  The rulebook keeps a fun, light-hearted tone, but play style could easily be darker if the referee wanted it to be.  Missions are varied and a referee could design more without a problem.
Everyone gets their moments to shine and can contribute to the success of the mission.  My group has had a lot of fun with it.

This game has some great ideas for representing ship-to-ship and hand-to-hand combat at the same time (because you're boarding each other's ships), while making both significant.  Even jobs like Engineer and Pilot feel as important as fighting.  But I'll never try it again, because the demo I played (at Origins 2008) was just horrible.

They welcomed newbies into the game.. and then didn't explain it at all.  Really.  The game started like this:

GM: What action do you do?
Me: Um, what are my choices?
GM: Well, you can try to upgrade equipment at the beginning.  It uses your Engineering skill [I think].
Me: My Engineering skill isn't very good.  Is there any danger if I fail?
GM: Not really.
Me: Ok, then, I'll try to upgrade this laser cannon.
GM: Ok, roll 2d6 like this, and... you failed.  The cannon is broken.
Me:  What??  But... you just said...

The first half of the game was sort of like a battle of wits with a djinn who is sworn to answer your questions in the least helpful way possible.  I started to get my footing in the end, but even then it was way too slow to be fun.  The **4-hour** game had about 18 rounds of actions!  I'm not sure where the time went, because my actions generally took a few seconds.

Wow, wow, wow. I play RPGs and Boardgames and this is a beautiful melding of the 2. You really feel part of a crew, everyone scrambling all over the ship to do their bit. We each played as different races and all had great strengths and weaknesses. This is just about Sci-Fi perfection. The only reason it's not a 10 is play length is more like RPG session length than comfortable boardgame length, and I've not yet played it enough to know whether or not my love for it will not diminish.

A fun game that is part role playing and part tactical combat.  Most sessions revolve around starship combat, including boarding actions.  It is a combat heavy game that can take quite a while to play, but keeps players active throughout (unless your character dies or goes unconscious).

It will be interesting to see if the upcomming expansions add more of a role playing element.

Got this at the BGG.CON Flea Market for $10.

What a tough dilemma.  I played the game at Origins and it is pretty much what I expected it to be.  It is truly a light RPG with some board gaming elements.  The main surprise was how all the players each had completely different roles to play.  In a typical RPG, players typically stay together and fight as a group.  This game requires the group to split up in order to accomplish their different goals.  Out game involved boarding another ship, so some had to stay behind to fire the weapons and control our ship while others had to actually board the enemy ship.  You might think it is less interesting to stay behind, but they always had plenty to do.

The problem I have is almost certainly the reason I was able to pick up the game so cheaply at BGG.con.  While the game is on the verge of being practical, I am not sure I will ever use my own copy.  I am playing board games because I don't have time to learn and play RPGs anymore.  This game is a very light RPG, but even so, I am unlikely to learn the game well enough to actually run it well.  Still, it is a fun game.  Unlike the previous owner, I am willing to keep the game due to it's unique nature and potential.

Though I'm not particularly experienced in this genre, this is my role-playing adventure of choice.  Takes a while to grasp the rules, but once you iron a few things out, game flows very smoothly.  Different roles lead to very different things to think about, and everybody needs to play to their strengths.  Combat is quick without being too simple.  Different ships will require different approaches.  Neat idea.

"Gives the roleplaying feel without needing the roleplaying effort." Love it for that, no need to wing it or do free style theatre ... and yet you may do so if you want. Fantastic also how it covers non-combat missions too. Nice to play with kids, my son looked forward to each mission.

Battlestations! is an enjoyable tactical combat boardgame in which players simultaneously game ship-to-ship duels with the boarding-party actions. You won't find any complex rules around manuevering physics or energy management. This game focuses on the "people"-element. Pilots, Engineers, Marines, and Scientist/Medics must man their Battlestations! and make skill rolls to control the ship. Characters can develop from mission to mission. 

The combination of ship-board action, starship combat, and the people element makes for an enjoyable dice-chucking evening. However, the rules are really RPG-light rather than boardgame. We played a number of games and eventually stopped because it wasn't heavy enough to be an RPG, but was too heavy to sit down and play well as a boardgame.

Tried this one out at GenCon SoCal.  I'm not quite sure what niche this one fills.  For games that look and smell like RPG light that I demo'd today, Doom seemed like a lot quicker and frankly, more fun.  There was obviously a lot of thought put into this one, but the components detract from the game, and it seems like it could drag out a while.  I was playing in one of those made for conventions demo events, where there were grandiose things happening, and a lot of chaos, so I might have a different view of the game in a different environment.

I've played this solo to test out a mission twice (without totally finishing the mission) and played a full game of the "Bootcamp" scenario with 4 new player characters. It was fun, but the players couldn't believe they were expected to finish this in 8 rounds. We talked about how they could have done better but assuming we played correctly I don't see how they could have finished in 8 rounds.

This was way too complex for me - too many rules and too little action.
You get to do so very little with your character and so it tends to be very dull. Manoeuvring your ship out in space is so slow-paced and there are way too many alternatives that you can choose between (special abilities, equipment), it takes ages to read through them all and pick which you would like to have :soblue:
But I like the different species you can choose between, for example; Silicoid, Xeloxian, Canosian. Check them out ;)
But overall, not a game for me.. Sorry :(

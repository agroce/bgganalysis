Initial Impressions:
------------------------------
I liked the action selection / Hand Management decisions in this one, but the game felt too long for what it is.  It was interesting also to mange how much incriminating evidence you had, but also trying to maximize points.  Wouldn't mind playing this from time to time, but it didn't blow me away.

Looks really interesting. Looking at backing it on Kickstarter.

Secret action selection. Picking the same action as someone else usually makes the action less profitable. Like High Society, the player with the most suspicion at the end loses. Okay once you understand the five action cards and the characters' special abilities.

Not my style of game, but as a designer I love it. So elegant. Action Phase always does it right :)

Fun, interactive simulatenous action selection game with a hefty dose of opponent screwage.  Surprisingly thematic but mostly mechanics (exactly how I like it), and a decent 40-minute playing time once you know how it all works.  Best with 4p by far.

I wanted to like this, but, bottom line, it was not fun.  It's a great theme, and the basic ideas work with it well enough.  The cycling through 5 action cards before refreshing was alright, if arbitrary, and I like that some actions are better when others to pick the same, and some are worse.  There is tiny text on about half of the loot cards, with many different effects.  I like variety, but this got annoying.  Too often we would have to stop to ask what a card did, sometimes twice for the same card.  I think the basic design would have shined with a more refined set of loot.  Keep bonuses for sets ("gold", "coins", etc.), use large, bold keywords for effects (e.g., "Fragile")  As it was, I was tired of playing by the second cycle of actions, and it was only halfway over.  I tried (really!) to enjoy it, but it just kept dragging on.  Thankfully, the game-ending police showed up about as early in the deck as they could have.  Full disclosure: the other three players, none of whom I regularly play with, all enjoyed the game.  Not me.

Tons of fun and lots of interesting choices to make (do I risk the extra suspicion for this card or not?).  The artwork is awesome and the game has lots of laughs.

I was interested in the game because I really like this type of mechanic in games and I really like this tongue and cheek theme... love it actually!

The game comes in a very small box and it packs a bit more punch than what might be expected from such a small package game... 

It's pretty simple to play but some cool  cool decisions to be made on when to play a specific card.

There's one card that's best played along with other players, there's one card that it makes no difference and there are 3 cards that are best when you are the only one playing them.

The game also has a bit of Take That because you can give suspicion to other players, you can exchange loot that has not been stashed, etc... like a good game of Scoundrels should have!

Also, each player will be a Scoundrel that has a 2 different special powers or abilities and there are several different scoundrels... and every game there'll be a Mark, the guy we are stealing from, that will dictate some differences to how things will get scored at the end of the game.

The cool part is that you want to steal the best things but usually the best things will also cause the Suspicion to be raised on the person that has them... and at the end of the game the Scoundrel that has more Suspicion on him will go to Jail and can't win!

We all liked the game a lot after our first play and I expect to play it some more :)

I'm not usually a fan of the "everyone choose a card and reveal" mechanism, but it works really well here. The different powers are all really cool, and I have yet to play any two games of this that felt at all similar. Just an excellent filler game with lots of crazy stuff going on.

Would play it often, but it's certainly a harder sell than some other games. I like that it plays similarly to Race for the Galaxy.

RATING: 6
This is a solid game, though a bit long for what it does. I always enjoy games with the suspicion mechanic in this one, like High Society, or Cleopatra and the Society of Architects, where you get good stuff but you can lose in the end because of it.

KS campaign was conducted very well. The game is nicely produced, has a comprehensive and well written rulebook. Game is not deep, - a filler or end-of-evening experience. 
Negatives: lots of tit-for-tat without a lot of progress, game is too long with too much text on cards.
Players have a small suite of action cards - actions are chosen in secret, resolved in turn order. Action cards cannot be collected until they have all been played, so it is important to time things correctly and to track other players. Goal is to collect and bank loot (theme is "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"). Feels like a distant cousin to Junta, action selection has echoes of Concordia.

This game is just plain fun. I enjoy the challenge of trying to steal all the things, but keeping your suspicion score down as to not be the player who gets arrested when the constable shows up. Having a different mark each game also can change things considerably as some actually change the rules of how to win, not just which loot scores you more points.

I adore the theme and the mechanisms all work, but the game is just too long for what it is. If we cook up a variant to shorten it without hurting the card interactions/set collection it'll stay in my filler rotation.

Addendum: I think Grifters just stole any enthusiasm I had for this one. They don't play similarly, but I can't see this one sticking around without heavy house ruling and I'm not sure I have the patience to test changes.

Played prototype at origins, tableau building with symbols in the tradition of Greed and Innovation, but with some supercool innovative mechanics which keeps the game fresh, fun, and interesting.  

Add a 'dirty rotten scoundrels' theme which is sorely underrepresented in our little industry and you have a fun unique game that will go into my 'carry around with me everywhere' backpack.

Glad I played it, can't wait to back it on kickstarter.  Travis and Nick are also two amazing dudes that are passionate about their games and game design and i can't wait to see what's next for them.

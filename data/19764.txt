Nice.  If you like Hex or Metro or Tsuro, you'll probably like this one.  I found that I was defending a lot and maybe this shows I haven't got my head around it enough.  Also I didn't really want to move my already placed pieces, and I'm sure that I should do at times.

I find this a very accessible gipf series game.  After you get to know how the pieces can move with regards to the punct and how they stack, the rules become quite simple.  It also benefits from having no intial layout phase as DVONN and YINSH.

I've been avoiding Punct for a decade.  I'm the superficial type who cares about the looks of his abstract game.  So what's this?  Holes in the board and generous use of grey-green?  It's been my loss.  

Punct is an intriguing game of connection in which pieces don't have to stay where they're first placed.  There's also stacking to pin an opponent's pieces and break or create chains. The limitations on movement and stacking imposed by a shaded spot on each piece (the punct) really give this game it's character.  I have found the game play less immediately engaging than in Zertz or Dvonn, but - no surprise - Chris Burm has made another game of considerable depth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I find the mechanism of moving over the dot a bit silly and unnatural. The latter is a necessity in good abstract strategy games.

The way pieces can stack works nice, but you'll find it hard to stack on already stacked pieces.

RATING: 7.71
This is quite possibly the most difficult game to follow visually in the GIPF series.  The combination of strategic placement of the piece and the spatial ability of the player to mentally move and rotate about the board makes PUNCT very unique.  My only gripe is the board...  The central hex is not nearly as well defined as it should be and I am dissatisfied in the quality of the board (my has warped with temperature changes).  I've been contemplating a wooden replacement.  Great gameplay and replayability, I highly recommend if your tastes stray towards abstracts.

A fine addition to the GIPF series.  This game plays quicker than the others - even TAMSK with its timers!  Each playing gets progressively more complex as players learn to spot key moves.

RATING: 7
An interesting game, can get pretty hectic and becomes a battle for one route as opposed to branching out for multiple ways. Defense feels very difficult: you feel like you are constantly on the back foot, does not have the great back and forth that TZAAR or DVONN have. More of a complex route building domino stacking game. While I am personally pretty fond of it, not many are gonna be chomping at the bit to play this one.

PÜNCT is criminally underrated in my opinion. A fine balance between tactical and strategic elements married into a connection game with truly amazing depth because of the sweeping movement of tiles, the different tile shapes, the 3D stacking, and the area influence mechanic in the "standard" rules. A crowning achievement in abstract board game design that rewards multiple plays.

I much prefer Yinsh, Dvonn, Zertz or Gipf!  

Production quality: The white game pieces look like dirty ashtrays stained with nicotine.  The board is as cheap looking as a fold-out Chinese Checkers set from the dollar store.  The WORST part about Punct is that the pieces do not "lock" into place when stacking or placing on the board!

Quite brain-melting. The number of options on a given turn is far greater than in any of the other GIPF games I've had the pleasure of playing. It makes you feel lost in the early stages of the game. That said, I'm sure it provides a greater depth because of said options.

The one game in the series that seems to stand a step below the rest. The time I played (mind you, both players are still rank beginners with this) we did two games. We went with the advanced rules (nothing starts in the middle), and I ended up spending my entire time trying to block my opponent with no build-up of my own. Yeah, got slaughtered. So, 2nd game I decide to ignore the opponent, so we both ended up in a race side to side. I won. But... we just looked at each other and asked "what's the point?" and packed the game up. We obviously missed it, yep.

PUNCT is an abstract in the GIPF series. I thought I'd heard that it was one of the less impressive games, so my expectations were low. I was very pleasantly surprised with this battle to connect two sides of a hexagon with different shaped pieces. There are other games like this, such as Twixt (3M), but PUNCT is way more interesting because there is a way to stack the pieces on top of one another. You can only do that by moving pieces that are on the board already and each piece has a "PUNCT" or dot that must sit on top of your color piece. These restrictions make positioning and planning paramount. I'd love to play PUNCT more to see if it has lasting power.

As I'm not an expert on connection games, I can't tell you how this rates against something like Twixt, but I can say I took right to it and enjoy playing.

I love games where first impressions give way to greater understanding; so often for me games are no more than what they first appear to be. PUNCT really grew on me, though. At first it seemed like Twixt redux. But as I got a chance to play more, more interesting subtelties emerged and the game really grabbed me. In fact, I think it's one of the better GIPF-games; not as interesting to me as the wonderfully different TAMSK, but more engaging than DVONN or YINSH, and I found the play to be more engaging than ZERTZ even (although I think most players will like ZERTZ at least a little better).

This game is a two dimensional goal (connect point a to point b) for which you must think in three dimensions. It blows my mind. There is conflict over key points. There are bluffing moves. There are direct and indirect lines of attack. There are three dimensional attacks. This game will work your mind over.

However, very quickly it seemed like it was impossible at our level of play to score a victory by connection, as defensive play would prevent it. Which turned the game into who owns the middle. Problem is, the connection game is far more fun than the own the middle game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Took a bit longer to grow on me than the rest of the series (I think because the mechanics are a slightly more complex). But by the second game I really enjoyed it. Might have the deepest strategy of the GIPF games. Takes a little longer to really understand though.

Update: Downgraded to a 6. The increased learning time means anytime you haven't played in awhile, I'm just going to pass on it and head for DVONN/YINSH/ZERTZ, which are all I really need anyway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
My rating for Pünct is a little lower (0.5) than for Zertz, even though I think Pünct actually might be the more interesting game. However, it took us a LONG time to play compared to every other game in the GIPF-series, so I cannot see myself play it a whole lot in the future. I think I would suggest most of the other games before this one. 

To me, Pünct is a little more brainburning game than the rest of the GIPF games because you have to rotate the pieces in your head. It’s a pretty cool mechanic, and it does set the game apart from the other games in the series, but it can slow the game down as there are so many options! Where to place, do you want to move a piece, how do you rotate it etc. If the game doesn’t end by someone connection two sides, the end game can drag as people are trying to get the most dots in the middle before the last piece is played. Still, it’s a decent game which is almost a 6.

The only Gipf game I don't own and have not played is Tamsk. Of the rest, I find Punct to be the most complex and heaviest. There are a lot of things going on. The economy of when/how to 'spend' your pieces as placement versus keeping them for flexibility in future placements VS future movements from positioning on the board VS playing for control of the central spaces is very tricky. Initially, I thought this was 'connection' game. And while, yes, it is...this is like no connection game I've seen before. The cagey positional battle AWAY from the main connection links that may appear more obvious makes for a lot going on.

This is not the right Gipf game for starting out with. Its the hardest to play well (again, barring comments on Tamsk). But this one may also have the greatest replay value and reward for climbing the learning curve. 

I'd be interested to see if after a couple hundred plays how often the starting player wins, when playing by the advanced rules (no tiles every placed in the central areas.)

Call me somewhat underwhelmed.  Maybe I expected too much given the relative greatness of Dvonn, Zertz, and Yinsh but Punct just left me with a "is that it?" feeling that is all the more disappointing given the reputation this series carries.  It's really just a variation on the connection game (see also Hex or Twixt) with the ability to suddenly change your approach.  Not a bad concept, but for some reason it just feels really flat- the smoothness and idiosyncracy of the other games just isn't here.  Maybe more plays will change my mind, but after the first 10 I'm just disappointed in it.

(Played at Essen 2005.) A bit of a downer, to be very honest. Of course the game is another beautiful abstract in the Project GIPF-series, but since it taxes your spatial intelligence you have to be very careful with chosing your opponent. I'm sure that with regular play you can be trained, but my poor girlfriend complained that she just didn't see things. That is of course not the game's fault, but it still left a bit of a sour aftertaste. I'm sure that against a proper opponent, the game becomes a brutal match of cerebral power. As such, I find it hard to rate: it is very difficult to say where the design ends and player problems begin. Personally, I haven't felt the need to try it again, although I found it odd to find out that when playing Schwarze Löcher many years later, the very same girlfriend beat me effortlessly. PÜNCT has never been a popular title of the series, so perhaps it might go on sale sometime, allowing me to try again.

Disappointing was the production quality (at that time) though. The PÜNCT-pieces could have had deeper indentations so they stacked and 'locked' better; in addition the production process had left a noticable grime of bamboo dust in the hollows. My first impulse was to get out soap and a brush and clean the pieces. I hope that's fixed now.

Probably good game as the others fron Gipf project (which I like very much), but a bit too complicated a confusing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Components: I have two issues with the production. The first is that the pieces end in rounded corners, even though they are meant to fill hexagonal spaces, thus making it difficult to visualize where the pieces abut other pieces. Second, the dimples on the underside of the pieces aren't quite pronounced enough to prevent pieces from being jostled about.

Experience: Somewhat interesting connection game.  Being able to move and rotate pieces keeps the game from being as rigid as most connection games, and there is an interesting tension between moving a piece up a level (which might cover an opponent's piece(s) and will be harder to cover than a piece at the base level), and using one's turn to bring a new piece into play (which allows one more flexibility down the road).

However, bringing pieces into play is mostly boring. It is only when a direct connection has been blocked, and victory can only be achieved through moving an existing piece, that the game becomes interesting. Thus the first segment of the game either ends in an unsatisfying victory or feels hollow in contrast to the more interesting decisions that come later.

GIPF series rank: 5 of 7.

A little heavier than the average GIPF series game due to the additional complexity of multi-level piece-stacking based on punct sanctity. In the end, though, barely a medium game as PUNCT is quickly learned relative to most games in my collection. And another great payoff -- another great game by Kris Burm that can be played and replayed, revealing new insights over time. That's my favorite aspect of the GIPF series -- the games are psychologically rewarding as one has revelations every few games or so of another hidden level of depth.

The Gipf series sort of dried up with this one.  I don't think the odd-shaped, moveable, stackable pieces have made this better than any other connection game.  That said, it's not bad.  It just doesn't shine the way Zertz and Yinsh do, and the mechanic isn't novel the way Tamsk's is.

You're making one compelled defensive play after another, and you think the end is near; but, suddenly the tables turn, and the other guy is fighting for his life. If your playing partner is leery of abstracts, this is the GIPF game that he or she is most likely to despise. It's basically a connection game with few of the elements that the other GIPF games share.

One play.  Somewhat disappointing.  Blocking/covering is relatively trivial so the game was a tad more frustrating and static than I would have liked.  Paradoxically, I did like that pieces that no longer help you can be moved to another location easily, often to block or cover.  I think this rating will go up once the obvious "make line/break line" zero sum strategy is abandoned.

I believe this is the odd one out in the GIPF series, because it has the most contrived rules, which makes it significantly less elegant than other titles. Apart from that, it is a connection game, and it falls way short of the queen of connection games, Twixt.

I love PÜNCT, but I cannot play it very well.  For some reason I have a very difficult time making effective moves; part of the problem has to do with the fact that white plays differently than black, but the other part is that I do not have much experience in connection games.  You have to be able to plan several moves ahead, as every piece you play needs to be able to support your other pieces in shutting down your opponent while making the connection.  The difficulty of the game is compounded by the different shapes of the pieces and the locations of the points on the pieces.  Each piece has a special use and you have to figure out when to use it.  Once you go on the defense and just start laying tiles solely to block your opponent (instead of also making the connection) the game is over.  I like all the games in the GIPF Project, but PÜNCT is my favorite, even though I lose most of my games.

RATING: 8
Abstract connection game, where players are attempting to make a bridge of connections across the game board.  Players alternate placing a piece onto the board, or moving an existing piece already placed.  Pieces occupy three "spaces" on the board, one space being the "punct" space.  Moving a piece means moving along one of the rows on the axis of the punct space, allowing for some very cunning plays.  The other nasty suprise is pieces can stack on other pieces, effectively locking them in place.  An attack can be effectively shut down by a patient defender, who suddenly becomes the attacker himself.  Taxing game, but well worth a look - especially if you like Twixt and Hex.

This game reminds me of Lines of Action.  A connection game with movement of the pieces allowed after they are placed.  Pieces can be moved on top of other pieces which reminds me of the beetles in Hive.  Oh... and if the connection isn't going to work out for either player... the game can become a race to see who can "stuff the center."  One of the more bizarre winning conditions I've experienced!

RATING: 8
Played once. It's interesting to think about how you can stack and rotate pieces in order to make your connection from one end of the board to another. Need more play, of course, in order to dive into all of the strategies.

RATING: 8
The more I play it, the more I like. It`s unlike any other game from the GIPF series. I only know two other games the require the similiar type of 3d thinking: Taluva and Java and they both belong to my favorites. It is criminally underrated probably because it really makes your brain work in a different way and not everybody likes it. Anyway try it. There is a chance you won`t like it, but if you will it might be one of your favourite games.

This is the worst of the Gipf so far. Not only are the parts crappy (both the board and the pieces) but the game just doesn't hold the interest of me or my friends.

RATING: 7
Out of the GIPF games, I felt that this was one where I could grasp the concept quite easily, and yet, it's still very challenging. Unlike my experience with ZERTZ or GIPF where it took me several plays before I even figured out what the heck was going on! I probably like this best of the GIPF series although in comparison, ZERTZ and GIPF are right up there in terms of their cleverness and subtle strategies.

Abstract connection games that plays well and looks great.  (A step up from Stratum.)  Using the 'Punct' dot to enable moves, and allowing unlimited layers, adds dimensions that really make the game.

far and away my least favorite GIPF game. the gameflow seems so linear for a game that is 3-D. How wierd. It must be my own limitations, or maybe it is my regular opponent's fault...yeah, that's the ticket it's him, not me!

No, it's me, I suck at this one.

(2 players) This would be my least favorite in the series that I've played (so far) but it's not bad. Gameplay seems too reactionary (i.e. spending most of your game responding to your opponent's moves). Need to play more.

RATING: 8
Twixt with attitude and a 3rd dimension.  Much like other Gipf games, one has the impression that th brain needs massive rewiring to play correctly.  Excellent on so many levels it blows the mind just to think that Herr Burm could outdo his already brilliant designs.  In this fan's book, he deserves a special place in the Hall of Fame of insanely great designers if only for the amount of torture I've been subjected to playing his games.  A must have for so many reasons.

RATING: 7
[Abstract Strategy, Connection] [2P:7] Marry YINSH with a connection game and you'll have something resembling PUNCT, Kris Burm's last game in his GIPF series. Like YINSH it has sweeping, dramatic moves and it can degenerate into trench warfare. An added bonus is vertical play, and the ability to play defensively. It's got the aesthetically pleasing high production values that fans of the series are used to, particularly the Bakelite pieces. PUNCT is a fitting finale to perhaps the best series of abstracts ever. My ranking of the series: TAMSK (9) YINSH (8), PUNCT (7), DVONN (6), GIPF (5), ZERTZ (4).

(On radar. It's got a 3rd dimension, so I'm automatically interested. Graphics look pretty stark though - same colours as YINSH. First Essen'05 game to make my wishlist, which is saying something about the weak field this year.)

complete mindbender of a game.  have to conect one side of gthe board to the other, but you can build over your opponent.  can also move your bits and rotate them, making it pretty strategic.  played a few games against a matched opponent that took hours.  easy to play, very hard to master.

I've played this a few times now. I think it's an excellent finale for the GIPF project--I just don't get it at all yet! In the few games I've played, moving pieces has seemed like an afterthought, so I haven't explored that dimension of the game. I think opening myself up to that aspect of play will be challenging for me, so I only expect the rating for this to rise. The only complaint: It's just not as aesthetically pleasing as most of the other games in the series. That green color is atrocious. :)

A Gipf-version of a connection game. The basic idea is again brilliant, but unfortunately the game has couple demerits. The first player seems to have a bit too big advantage and it's quite possible to create situations where the game ends up in an endless loop. Definitely worth trying for anyone who enjoys abstracts, but in the end, perhaps the second weakest entry in Gipf-series.

I originally thought my less enthusiastic reponse to this game was my general blah attitude towards 'connect the sides' games in general. But I find them growing on me as I play them more.

I think it is more a case that this game is a very lackluster experience if you aren't playing against a determined, and evenly skilled opponent.

This bits are the same nicely speckled bakeliteesque material as DVONN's rings, but I'll bet the board, with its many perforations isn't going to hold up to a lot handling.

This is my personal favorite of the GIPF series. Unfortunately I almost never get to play it. Everyone else in my gaming group feels it is too abstract and can't get their heads around it. So we usually end up playing YINSH, TZAAR, or DVONN.

RATING: 8
I can't help but think that this one has almost an Abalone/Sumo type feeling to it, strike & counter-strike... like Yinsh, it leaves many opportunities for sneaky (or desparation) moves to turn things around.  Like all GIPF games (except Tamsk, by design), things can get slowed down to a crawl once people start analyzing things.

This is probably the least inventive of the GIPF series, and the least clean from a game design perspective. Personally, though, I would rather play PÜNCT than either ZERTZ or DVONN. Although the decision space in PÜNCT is gigantic, I can intuitively "see" what is happening better than I can in the ostensibly simpler DVONN or ZERTZ.

Myranking:
YINSH > TAMSK > PÜNCT > DVONN > ZERTZ

PUNCT is the last of the GIPF games I've played. It doesn't seem to have the elegance of the other games in the project. That said, it is still a very strong game that rewards careful planning and keeping an eye on the entire board.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The circle has come to a close! Twenty games down the road I think I can say that the Gipf Project has another winner on its hands with Pünct. There's lots of scope for creative play and surprise, but there's also a fair amount of depth and potential for study. The tactile fun of stacking the pieces is nice, too. Some have insisted that white has an advantage, but I think the situation is rather that black player needs to understand that he has to get in white's way early or the game becomes a race that black is doomed to lose. In other words, white has the advantage of being a piece ahead but black has the advantage of being in a reactive position. The only aspect of the game that doesn't thrill me is that a player can be one move away from winning but his opponent can keep the game alive for turn after turn with desperate moves that don't really improve his own position. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I usually end up enjoying a game of PUNCT, but the beginning is always weak for me.  It feels too much like a race that the first player has an advantage in.  Possibly with increased plays I will get a feel for how this can be countered, but right now it feels a tad unbalanced.

RATING: 7
Punct is the least loved living member of the GIPF series (TAMSK receiving a bit less love, but is also no longer an official member of the family). While it may be fair to state that PUNCT is the least elegant in terms of its game-end mechanics because of its "tie-breaker" second scenario (i.e., if one player runs out of pieces, whoever has the most pips showing in the middle wins), this does not preclude PUNCT from being a rich, brain-burning experience that is its own unique member of the family. Every game in the family has a clear lineage but derives its own personality from the twists that are added -- here, you can quickly locate elements from connection games like Hex, Twixt, and other similar games. However, the really interesting twist is not only can you move your pieces but your pieces can be moved such that they vertically stack upon others -- I *always* love a game that utilizes the 3rd dimension to good use. Overall, while it's not my favorite of the series, it still merits its place alongside the others with its beautiful components and thought provoking play.

RATING: 6.5
After only the 1st few solo plays of Punct, I find I don't think it's quite as strong as the other games in the GIPF series from Kris Burm.

Perhaps I need to learn/evolve blocking strategies, but the game rarely seems to go on for very long because (as the designer suggests) early games seem to end with a connection.

Until I figure out how to 'play defense' this game doesn't seem any stronger or more interesting than many other connection games, (Connections, Twixt, Quoridor).

Based on Burm's comments in the rules, and on the high respect I have for these games in general I suspect this is a personal failing as opposed to game failing; still I am going to initially rate this at a 6.5 until I can get my head around it a bit better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Well, this is a weird one, and of all the GIPF games, it's the hardest for me to read the board. I have a lot of trouble with the things that bend and figuring out where something can go, and even more trouble extrapolating from there what might be done in the future. So the spatial element kind of kills it for me.  My least favorite game in the series. (2 plays)

This is definitely my favorite of the GIPF games, which surprises me given how it's by far the lowest rated by most people. 

I love how different the game is, while still utilizing fairly elemental strategies. The interaction between players is unparalleled, as the lines between victory and defeat are constantly (and imperatively) shifting. It is a satisfying experience, win or lose. 

The game can be a bit prone to inevitable victory/loss situations, where the result is apparent one or two moves away from the end, however this is balanced out by how the game can take such surprising turns at any moment. 

It is, in a word, one of the most "dynamic" games I've played.

Okay game. The game seems hard to get your pieces onto the map in the right position to be useful. I've only played a few times though and know that I'm missing out on some of the strategy.

Might be more of a brain burner than its brothers, the ability to build upwards and over or on top of opponents really adds to the depth.  I like how pieces are mobile once on the board and how you can take that mobility away by jumping on an opponents piece.  

Punct requires you to be subtle and allows for some deviously sneaky moves, the only downside is equally skilled players can go back and forth for some time and not equal won't relish much of a match.

A decent connection game though somewhat uninspiring.  The twist being in the movement and/or stacking (rather than placement) of an established piece along a direct line of its 'PUNCT' location with the option to pivot the same piece along its 'PUNCT' axis, thereby creating a question of intent in direction to deceive your opponent.  Much to consider here in forward thinking with regard to the pieces left in hand.

RATING: 8
Challenging game of blocking and breaking free, with interesting placement rules. Players have pieces in 3 shapes, consisting of three dots. The object is to form a string of unbroken dots from one side of the hexagonal board to the other. One dot on each piece is a solid color, called the punct. Already placed pieces can "slide" along a straight line from the location of the piece's punct. Pieces can slide on top of other pieces, forming stacks or bridges and in this way you block or slice through another player's line. Pieces can also be re-oriented as long as the punct remains in line with its original position. The mechanics for sliding and spinning pieces are inspired and a game between two strong players could be a real dogfight. There's an alternate victory condition that creates almost a game-within-a-game. Given that two strong players would probably play to a draw rather frequently, there is a central area where the player with a majority of dots will win if all pieces have been played and neither player as linked opposite sides. Accounting for both victory conditions as you go is great fun. Opportunities for sly and surprising play abound.

A fun abstract, though not as good as YINSH in my opinion. The lay-or-jump options are quite good, as are the possibilities to block your opponents strong pieces by jumping on top of them.[Preliminary rating after one play]

Woah, I've been lost in my first few plays of every GIPF game so far, but this one poses the biggest challenge to my brain.  For some reason it's very difficult for me to visualize how to plan ahead.  I think I'll need way more practice before I even feel like I understand how the game works.

Update: with more plays, I enjoy it more.  Still not a good player, but I'm having a good time and desire to keep playing it.  Up to an 8.

The heaviest of the GIPF series I've played. Its a good game, the 3D aspect allows for some tricky play (and therefore adds to AP). But its probably not one that I'll play often.

Punct doesn't grab you at first sight like many of the other Gipf games do. It takes a couple of plays until you see the strategic layers hidden in this thing... And then you see why Burm is the master of abstracts and he's not about to lose his title.

A GIPF szériából, amit eddig kipróbáltam (YINSH, DVONN, GIPF, PÜNCT) ez tetszett a legkevésbé. De még így is zseniális. Teljesen különleges látásmódot igényel, ami az elején úgy tűnik, hogy könnyen elsajátítható, de az ellenfelek eléggé meg tudják nehezíteni az ember dolgát. :)

3D Connection game with twists and underhanded setting up.

Can you block and fool your opponent long enough to create a connection?
Can you adapt in time to recover when your opponent does it to you?

Played only on biskai.de

Wow!

In movies and literature there is phenomenon where people who begin to watch or read classics after a lifetime diet of modern works find those classics worn out and cliched because the techniques and ideas that were fresh and original when the classics were first created have been reused and rehashed ad nauseum in later, usually lesser, works.

Punct may have that effect on me relative to earlier abstract connection games such as Twixt and Hex.  The difference, in this, case, is that Punct will do this because it is so brilliant itself, taking the ideas first presented in these games, and then building on them to create a truly breath-taking game.

Punct is showing me a depth of strategic and tactical play worthy of mention in the same breath as Chess, and, in the strategic dimension at least, greater than Yinsh.  The addition of movable pieces and the third dimension to play makes blocking and connection tactics far from straightforward.

Truly hardcore elegance fans may find the inability to place pieces directly in the centre of the board and the stacking rules a bit on the fiddly side, but since the total rules weight is so small relative to the strategy, tactics and level of interest of the decisions involved, that I doubt any gamer could truly object.

If I gave immediate 10s to games, this would be one, and I fully expect it will end up there after some more play, barring an unforseen major problem with the game.

UPDATE: Okay, so this isn't a 10. In fact, I'm dropping my rating to 8. While I am still in awe of the depth and beauty of Punct, It is only really enjoyable when played by people of neighbouring skill levels. Most of the time, even a moderate mismatch will lead to a blowout result. This limits the opportunities to play Punct, at least in an entertaining manner.

UPDATE: There's a lot of interesting stuff here, but it's just a tad off. Dropped to 7, since I'll play it if it's suggested, but I no longer feel like I have to play it regularly. There are better abstracts out there.

[microbadge=131][microbadge=1256]

An odd game, with certainly the one of the oddest boards I've ever dealt with.  I like the unusual 3D aspects of it (although a bird's eye reference of the board is constantly necessary); however, the restrictions for jumping on other pieces can lock down large parts of the game.  Still, the conflicting victory conditions  do lead to some interesting tactical choices.

RATING: 6
Very attractive components with a distinctive feel and look to them make this game physically a pleasure to play. After a couple of tries, I haven't yet managed to figure out how the stalemate rule in the beginners game or the center-hex rule in the standard game are supposed to add to gameplay - they both feel like rather arbitrary add-ons that only really serve to distinguish this from other connection games such as Twixt. Might well change my mind if I can find somebody to play with whom I'm evenly matched, though.

Still a mystery. I'm somewhat baffled by the different species of pieces, which make the game a-Gipfical. Can't rightly rate it as high as Dvonn to start out, but it's a connection game, which I'm all over. Punct revisits the mobility issue prevalent in Dvonn and Tamsk, but via 'trapping'. Could still move up.

Kris Burm does it again!  Abstract games are very unforgiving; the balance between intuitive to play and readily solvable is very hard to get right.  Kris Burm has demonstrated that he can do it not just once, but 6 times.  

Pünct manages to be aesthetically pleasing, fast, and intuitive.  It is also totaly different from anything else in the series, being a connection game.  We'll be seeing this one in the top 100 soon, I'm sure :)

My problem with Pünct is that it's a connection game. It is definitely the best connection game I've played, but that's not much, as I hate the genre a lot, for some reason. Other than that, Pünct is just about as well done as any other Gipf game, so especially if you're into connection games, it's definitely worth checking out.

Avoid.

RATING: 8
My least favorite and least played of the fabulous GIPF series of games–perhaps because it's the one I least understand. I'm just not a big fan of the Hex-like task of connecting two opposite sides of the board. Clearly though Pünct adds several dimensions toward achieving this goal and is a very fine game: I plan to give it several more tries–at least. [6 plays]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Yet another stunning and original GIPF Project game. Although ostensibly a connection game, the geometric arrangement of the pieces, their mobility, and the center hexagon territory makes this a game of shape, territory, spatial awareness, and connectivity. It's a game of great depth and remarkable clarity. A beautiful, brilliant, and profound conception, PUNCT is a game of discovery, contemplation, and aesthetic delight!

The less engaging game of the Gipf project - it's surely complex, and it reuses known elements in a refreshing way, but it's less elegant than the other games in the series (two quite different possible goals and there can still be a draw), and of course than the connection games that Pünct aims to be compared with (Twixt or Game of Y for instance). It suffers as well from defending being easier than attacking.

My wife and I have played this a few times now.  I think the long list of restrictions and requirements for moves makes this very hard to learn.  Once we mastered the moves, the game seemed quite dull with wins coming after only half the pieces are played.  The rules about piling on another layer are so restrictive it seems you can almost never do it organically (by moving a piece not specifically placed to be moved) rather than just having to place a pre-set piece on the turn before--effectively it takes 2 turns to cut your opponent's path.  Seems to make the games much shorter, but with less depth than the other Gipf family games.

This is, to date, the only GIPF game I owned and then got rid of. I have long since forgotten any specifics on why that was, so this is a comment more about feel and not about the unambiguously mathematical reasons for a game's failings. 

It felt so flat and [i]off[/i]. We played and it was merely OK, we played again and it felt nothing like the exhilaration we felt with TZAAR, there was no "aha!" of trap setting from ZERTZ, there was no immediate familiarity of YINSH, or the combination of opacity and allure of GIPF. It was a game about putting weird pieces on a weird board trying to connect opposing sides. You didn't have direct access to the center of the board, instead needing to move pieces there from elsewhere. That should have been neat, yet it…wasn't. We just didn't care. There wasn't any tension. You took turns and then it was over. Somebody won; yay. 

I felt vindicated when online gamelog analysis showed that the player to move a piece first usually lost, as that meshed with our feelings that you could sense your initiative vanish once you moved an already-placed piece; it was all scrambly reaction from there, and that didn't feel like a positive thing to us. PUNCT didn't feel like it belonged in the GIPF series, like it was the germ of an idea that needed more time to reach maturity.

Generally I don't like connection games, but Kris Burm - as usual - made a great work. The different shapes of pieces, the differente position of the "Puncts", the game on different levels ... all makes for a fine and deep game both tactically and strategically.

RATING: 9
I love connection games! This has the additional bonus of the use of the third dimension!

Impressive functional board! I didn't know (until opening the box) all the spaces on the board have holes punched in them. This enables the pieces (which have circular bumps underneath them) to sit snugly on the board.

An interesting game, my first of the series. Its very simple, yet very strategic. In a way I was a bit disappointed that it ended so soon. Not that I knew much about to begin with, but I expected more for some reason. I guess you have to play several games back-to-back.

After finding Yinsh to be such a great game, I had high hopes for this one. Maybe I need to try it another few times, but this reminds me of Hex and in the same way, feels very boring and "always one step ahead/behind the other guy".

An intense, screw-you game of connection, rotation, and energetic weirdness.

It feels far less puzzle-like to me (DVONN is puzzle-like). There's more long term resonant meaning to the moves - certain pieces control certain lanes, certain moves render areas accessible, or open them up. It has much more of the pure brain-to-brain fight of chess, and less of the private-brains-in-seperate-cubicles-racing feel of the puzzle-y abstracts.

Kris Burm is my total freaking hero.

Connection game with the relatively rare ability to move and rotate pieces as well as place new ones.

I can't say enough good things about all Kris Burm's board games: Gipf, Dvonn, Yinsh, Punct, Tzaar, and Zertz. Even my 9-year-olds are really into them, and each one challenges your brain to come up with unique strategies for winning. They're brilliant in their simplicities!

A solid game, but a bit too much emphasis on blocking rather than development for my tastes. My least favourite of the Gipf series, but I'm still happy to play it.

Update: Enjoying it more with more play, so I bumped it up a ratings notch. Glad to see there's no dud in the series.

Update again: It's a game of threatening connection to make points in the centre, very much like Go's use of threat of capture to score territory

Yet another update: I now think this is one of the better games in the series... it just took me a long time to grok it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Unreadable and too complex. All my games ended by an obvious move that was not read by the losing player. Also has the longest and less intuitive rules in the GIPF series... Twixt is a far better connection game IMHO.

--- 

J'ai énormément de respect pour les jeux du [[Project_GIPF]], et la plupart de ceux que j'ai essayé m'ont enthousiasmé, et tout particulièrement [gameid=7854], [gameid=108] et [gameid=2346]. Je n'ai pas encore essayé [gameid=527] et [gameid=528] ne m'a pas spécialement convaincu (trop « purement calculatoire » à mon gout), mais PÜNCT m'a carrément déçu. Le jeu est extrêmement difficile à lire, et la difficulté n'est plus ici de construire une stratégie, mais simplement de s'assurer que son adversaire ne peut pas gagner en deux coups…

Du coup, on compte surtout sur une erreur de son adversaire. Avec beaucoup de pratique, peut-être que PÜNCT peut se transformer en un jeu de stratégie aussi riche que ses camarades, mais dans l'état, il est à la limite de l'injouable. L'« autre jeu de connexions », [gameid=949], me parait bien plus accessible et tout aussi riche.

As a general rule, I like connection style games -- just look at all of the train games I have :)  For some reason, though, this game just has not clicked for me.  By far, this is my least liked game of the GIPF series.  Perhaps I am missing something subtle that prevents me from enjoying it?  Still, were it not for being part of the GIPF set, there is a reasonable chance I would get rid of this one.  Perhaps more plays will change my mind.  [02/17/2008]

Not just another connection game. The ability to move one's pieces and pin down the opponent's adds considerable depth to the gameplay. On the other hand, the alternate victory conditions about having a majority in the center give the game a dual character that is a bit distracting.

Abstract, Connection. Another great GIPF series game. Nice twist on the connection genre, being able to build/bridge over other pieces, as well as sliding and rotating your pieces. I should have a GIPF game night, heh.

This is a decent more open version of Hex brought to a new level, quite literally.  Often you want to cover people up just to be a nuicance (plus it is harder for others to cover it up and the stacked pieces end up being quite versatile).  It is tough making the decision to move pieces as often you want the turf you claimed, but you need keep your options open to swoop in for the kill.

I guess that I'd put this #5 in the series, although it's close to a draw with YINSH, as the games are pretty different.

UPDATE: Moving it up a bit having played a few more times. It's still pretty bizarre and the way to win is a very slow and tactical burn. It reminds me of a good match of chess in that regard. I enjoyed it when I played it, but don't think I'd be coming back again and again to this one as much as others in the series.

Moves up a bit after playing it more. It's certainly seems quite unforgiving if you make a wrong move, but I think that's what a good abstract should be all about.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Another good GIPF game, albeit the weakest of the series. This one is a connection game that involves stacking pieces on top of your opponent's. I like the 3D reasoning required, but PUNCT is my least favourite of the GIPF series. The alternate victory condition (area control of the middle) is less interesting than connecting one side to the other, and with experienced players the former will crowd out the latter. The early and mid game would be the most interesting but for the fact that they are a lot less meaningful than the end. More than any other GIPF game, PUNCT seems to come down to whoever makes the first mistake.

GIPF project connection game: place triominoes to connect any two sides of the hex-board. The main wrinkle is that each piece has a coloured "PÜNCT" spot, which can be picked up and moved along any straight line (no blocking); it can be placed again in any rotation using the PÜNCT as a pivot. It's possible to place on top of other pieces in some circumstances.

One of the problems I have with the GIPF games is the inelegant features that make them feel less "timeless" than classic abstracts such as Go or Hex. PÜNCT is probably the worst at this, with its half-dozen types of piece and its weird exceptions for movement. 

It's interesting, but not my favourite of the series.

(Not counting TAMSK) Punct is my least favorite game in the Gipf series. I find it inelegant mechanically, ergonomically, and aesthetically. Plus, being a connection game, it has to compare itself to Hex, Twixt (et al) and it suffers mightily in comparison. 

But all this means in the end, Kris, is that you're not a god. You're just pretty damned close :)

Another GIPF game that plays quickly. The idea here is to use your differently shaped pieces to connect two sides of the hex shaped board. The trick is, once placed, a piece can be then moved - either jumped to a new spot, or on top of other pieces. This allows for some tricky blocking and surprise wins.

While it is an engaging game, there are far better in the project. The board feels flimsy, and the tactile sensation of putting a piece into a cardboard hole is unpleasant - like playing a game of chess on a bowl of oatmeal. Also, like Tzaar, it feels like one is always on attack or defense but seldom does the momentum shift.

I like the blocking mechanism - I am a fan of [gameid=949], and it initially looked like [gameid=19764] adds some nice variations to that basic idea.  The center scoring tiebreaker seems a little odd, so in the end I put it up for trade after two plays.  I'm not averse to revisiting it, I just didn't think I needed this and [gameid=949] in the collection.

This is probably my least favorite of my GIPF games (I own all except TAMSK). Reminds me a bit of Twixt, in that the primary objective is to connect two sides. This final edition of the GIPF series seems to have more rules than the others I've played, and it has two very different victory conditions. For these reasons, I think it is the least elegant of the series (I haven't played TAMSK). Gameplay is fairly straightforward. My first games took about 5-10 minutes to complete.

It wasn't bad, but it was significantly harder for me to plan turns in advance in PUNCT than in the other games in the series.  The rules are nice and streamlined, plus I like how different the game feels from the others in the series, but it seems very difficult to formulate any sort of long-term strategy.  I'd be happy to play again though in order to learn it better, but may not suggest it if the others are at hand.

 The first player has a significant advantage (in over 1000 recorded online games White's win % is around 60), although this actually makes playing the disadvantaged Black an interesting challenge- one must approach Black differently than White, just like in Chess. Observing some of the best players on the web play this is fascinating, and makes me want to play more, but in my own games I sometimes feel as if there's something off, some lack of elegance in the mechanics where the game can just devolve into a back and forth war of disruption- unlike other games in the series which seem to speed along to an inevitable conclusion. PUNCT lacks this inevitability, and there is actually an alternate victory condition which is unsatisfying and just seems there to diffuse the potential stale-mate. All this being said I don't yet consider myself experienced enough to authoritatively claim the game definitively has such problems, and I'm still looking forward to more exploration, especially online against the good players.

PÜNCT, the fifth released game by design in project GIPF, is a connection game. The goal is to connect two opposite sides of the board.

I had high expectations for this game, but have been a bit disappointed - the sheer number of move possibilities is much higher than in the other games in the Gipf project, which makes it easy - at least at my low level of play - to win or lose a game because one player fails to notice an obvious move. It is probably not a bad game, but it is a bit too heavy for me as an abstract.

I *really* quite can't wrap my head around PUNCT, though I still love playing it.  It doesn't quite have a timeless feel of a GIPF or YINSH, though.  We'll see upon more playings.

Least favourite of the GIPF games I've played (Zertz, Dvonn) but still an interesting abstract.

Intense and brilliant.  Indirection and feints right and left.

A very average game.  As a Zertz player, I was disappointed by Punct.

I have not played much this far, but this game is very tricky...It's the kind of game that evolves the more you play it. Prone to analysis paralysis.

After 1 Play: I liked this one less than the other Gipf games I've played so far.  I think the connection genre is just less appealing to me than other types of abstracts.

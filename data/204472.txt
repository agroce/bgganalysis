Wow. This was actively bad. You could be 'knocked down' and just spend turns waiting for the other players to come rescue you. And with only two actions a turn, that could be quite a long time. Additionally, all the 'bad stuff' comes down to... a die roll. on 1-3 you take damage, 4-6 you are fine. Wow, that's a fresh mechanic *rolls eyes*. Oh, and sometimes you randomly draw a card "everyone roll or take damage." Poorly designed game that would have been welcomed in the 80s, not now.

Schade! Es sieht wirklich sehr vielversprechend aus. Aber die Glücksanteile in diesem Spiel sind doch sehr hoch und frustrieren beim wiederholten mal spielen. Zumindest ging es uns so.
Die Grafischen Umsetzung wirkt auf den ersten Blick richtig Stimmungsvoll. Allerdings sind die Plättchen sehr nüchtern gestaltet und oft nicht richtig bzw. eindeutig zu erkennen. Hier hätte man Grafisch bestimmt noch deutlichere Strukturen herausarbeiten können um dies für die Spieler eindeutiger zu machen.
Ansonsten macht es Spaß die Höhle zu erkunden und die Fähigkeiten der versch. Rollen zu testen. Auch ist das Thema an sich gut im Spiel durch die Mechaniken wiederzufinden.
Doch wie schon oben erwähnt, hätte man die Würfel bei dem ein oder anderen Element sparen können.
Vor allem am Ende, wenn Reihenweise die Mitspieler nur noch würfeln um zu überlegen frustriert.

If you're willing to get into the role-playing of the "lost in the caves" theme, this can be an entertaining coop. The mechanics are nothing new or exceptional, and the amount of "roll for success" is going to irritate you if you don't like that sort of thing. Basically, the ability to perform many important actions are based on a 50% success rate die roll with no normal way to mitigate this. You can be stuck at the bottom of a crevasse and do nothing turn after turn because you can't get a high roll. However, the unique abilities for the different roles (Engineer, Leader, Diver, etc.) are varied and lead to interesting strategic possibilities. 

The materials are generally nice and sturdy, but one really large issue detracts from game play: the cave tiles are black-on-black, extremely hard to make out (apparently they're printed to use with a UV light). Playing under average pub lighting conditions, we could barely see the path and features of the caves on the tiles. One of the poorest choices of form-over-function I've seen in a game.

Demoed at Essen 2017. From the demo game that we played it looked really dull.. The quality of the components and the art is amazing but the gameplay is definitely not. It is simple tile laying game where you try to escape from the cave. There are bad things waiting like gas, flood, tremor and monsters!! And it sounds like fun but in reality those are just some random events that can happen at the end of each round and affect only certain tiles. And we found that there is even no point in exploring the tile first before moving on to it because there is nothing bad that can happen immediately and there is small chance that the event will affect that particular tile.
The game gets a lot tougher in the end. Especially if the team split and someone have a long way to the exit. But we didn't enjoy it anyway. 
There are some expansions that might make it more interesting but we demoed core game only.

Another co-op game where the player should beat the game. I like this game and how ITB really worked hard to balance and smoothen the mechanic. I like how the 'bad-luck' cards being the timer of the game itself. The dicing is not everyone's cup of tea but it's necessary to be there to be the random factor. Something else that matters me the most is the movement of the Horror. In my point of view, the Horror should be more, ferocious, more beast-like, and more randomly moving. It hurts me the most not to back the miniature and I hope it will come on retail soon.

Love cave-exploration theme (i.e., Rebel's "The Cave") but don't need the fantasy horror cross-over. Probably will back just to get the tiles to use with the Cave rules. There's so much natural beauty and science in the subterranean world, I don't see what a "bodyguard" and made-up monsters add. "The Cave" is OOP so a new spelunking game with other mechanics and more focus on geology and a more RPG feel with player-abilities definitely has a place in the market.

Backed on Kickstarter.

I love the theme of cavers trapped underground with unknown horrors hiding in the darkness...

You have to play 4 characters, but it works great because each character only has 2 actions each turn.  (You can "exert" to take a 3rd action).  So the turns are really quick.

But like any good co-op, the game fights back with cave-ins, floods and horrors spawning in the cave.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The mechanics are intuitive and ready to teach. The game creates great high drama moments. The components are top notch in quality and look great on the board. The Kickstarter bonus dice are awesome. It's really convenient having a color coded die for each role. I do understand why others outlined the cave proper with silver sharpie. My group played in the dark with a led UV flashlight and headlamps. I highly recommend it. The UV helps pop the cave tiles.
10/10 would back again.

I'm on turn 5, three of which I've been unconscious and unable to take actions.  Whoo hoo!  Seriously, though, the game has an interesting theme, but the mechanics allow multiple turns to go by with players not having actions.  That is lame.  Also, with one health left, it's often 'reveal' and 'move into tile', which isn't super captivating.  I probably should've healed myself.

I am lukewarm on coop games, but the ones I do like (Pandemic, Flash Point) have rapidly changing common goals.  This did not.  You just have to get out, and by 'you' I don't mean everyone (at least not for a bronze win).  The game isn't really semi-coop either (though I'm sure that comment could start a comment thread).  Cutthroat Caverns evokes that semi-coop feeling much better - yeah, I want loot, but need other players to survive.  

It was was unrealistic to be staring at the deck and know you have 'about this many' cards before an exit would appear.  This led to us metagaming and trying to bunch back up towards the mid-end, which isn't consistent with the theme.

All in all, this game had some fun ideas, but I thought it fell flat mechanics-wise.

Interesting tile laying game with a sort of push your luck aspect, which could give you 50% more actions on a turn or could take away 33% of your health.
interesting and fairly unique theme, however the cave tiles are pretty dark (thematic) but they can be difficult to see which are the pathways on them. i do like that this will supposedly glow under a black light.

Game play is fast fun and simply and can feel a little multiplayer solitaire as honestly the win conditions for all the cavers getting out didn't really make any difference as there is actually very little you can do to assist others so it becomes more everyone for himself or herself.

Horrors were very disappointing, just purple cylinders (when all the other tokens are sculpted) and honestly they were too infrequent to be relevant. Other hazards however, gas/flood cave in were particularly punishing, which is good fun.

I think I prefer the cave which is very similar but does not have the co-operative aspect, but I certainly would happily play this again.

Played a game in tts. Great stuff, tense decision making and board placement actually matters unlike betrayl. Barley got two survivors out if 4 alive because i tried to rush discovery of the cave. Game has wonderful risk reward aspects to it in everything from character design to movement to board revelation. Exhaust rules were a bit clunky as it wasnt apparent if you could do two actions that cost two by paying an exhaust or if you could heal from exhausting, like does the heal go off before the exhaust roll resulting in just nothing happening if you fail the skill check? May have just missed something. This will be my go to game for this haloween.

RATING: 6.5
* played 7 games (Normal mode) on TableTopia -> 6x solo (4 cavers), 1x 2p (4 cavers)
* lost the first 4 solo attempts, won 2p game (1 caver dead), won next two solo attempts (2 cavers dead, and 0 cavers dead respectively)

I love the idea and theme of this game. The gameplay is fun and tense and I like the variable player powers. It's easy to get into; the rules are simple and the rulebook (WIP) is nicely laid out. You could easily classify this as a gateway game (just a tiny notch up from Carcassonne). 

The tile laying is a lot of fun. The player turns are quick and seemless, albiet somewhat short (2 action points with an optional third). One potential detractor when playing multiplayer, is when you caver is unconscious you must skip your turn until another caver comes and heals you. This could be quite boring as you are left with nothing to do but watch your fellow players take their turns (I found it was not uncommmon for a caver to be down for 3 or more rounds). A was also frustrated at times after spending 3 or 4 entire rounds on one of my cavers trying to secure a rope up a cliff face and doing nothing else.

There is a lot of the push-your-luck element involved. It is a race against the clock and the hazard deck is your hourglass (much like in the Pandemic series). On Normal mode, this represents 22 rounds. You have to get through 59-65 cave tile to reach the exit. Which means you need to average laying ~3 tiles per round between all of your cavers. Between healing, placing ropes, removing rubble, swimming through flooded tiles (all of which use up a cavers entire turn), or simply wasting time backtracking after reaching a dead end, avoiding the cave monsters, or going after a fallen fellow caver, placing 3 tiles per round can sometimes be harder than it sounds (especially in later rounds).

All this means at some point, you are going to have to take risks and push your luck just to get enough tiles laid. And, unfortunately, this is where I felt that the game fell flat (pun not intended). It seems heavily luck based. On the times that I won, I found that it was only because of a string of turns where I found myself saying "well, that was lucky". Conversely, it's easy to get stuck and be at the mercy of the dice roll (skill check, skill check, skill check) and/or hazzard draw - left to choose between two bad options and then crossing your fingers at the next card off the deck. Often I just found myself cringing and muttering at my poor luck (dice rolling bonanza) and frustrated as the game mercilessly punished me.

Having said all of that, the game has left me curious and wanting to try again. Perhaps playing solo made me rush my turns and gave me tunnel vision (sorry, again). Maybe with a table of friends talking each move through, it would be an easier affair. 

I will wait for retail and perhaps try it again in the future.

A játék egy barlangban játszódik, a célunk, hogy kijussunk. Alapvetően lapkalehelyezés, nem fogja a műfajt megreformálni… Legalább négy barlangászt irányítunk (tehát pl. kétszemélyes játék esetén kettőt fejenként), karaktereink különböző képességekkel bírnak, így már az is fejtörés, hogy jól válasszuk ki a barlangászokat. A barlang felfedezésének tempóját a választott akcióval befolyásolhatjátok: felfedés, felfedezés – a különbség, hogy előbbi esetében külön akcióval lehet csak rálépni, utóbbi esetén felfeded, és rá is lépsz a lapkára. A korlátozott akciókat nehezített lapkák (pl. szoros, szakadék) tovább bonyolítják, és hirtelen nagyon kevésnek érzed a két akciópontot, amit ingyen kapsz. Mi itt használjuk leginkább a kockát: sikeres dobás, azaz legalább négyes kidobásával kapsz még egy akciót. Ha nem sikerül? Mínusz egy élet. Apropó! Nem csak az akciók száma, hanem az életek száma is korlátozott: jellemzően hárommal rendelkezünk, amiből gyakran és sokat vesztegetünk speciális lapkák (ún. nehéz terep), illetve a kör végi események során. Ugyanis, ha mindenki lépett (szigorúan az óramutató járásának megfelelően, ami tovább nehezíti a játékot, hiszen nem tudunk reagálni a másik lépésére), a kör végét jön valamilyen esemény, ami mindig rossz: árvíz, földrengés, beomlás stb. És jöhet a horror, avagy iszony is. Ez egy sötétben bujkáló szörny, ami egyből beszippant. Nem részletezi a szabály, és bár minik is készültek hozzá, számomra inkább amolyan belső félelem, iszony a dolog, ami a szűk, sötét, kiszámítatlan közegben pszichológiailag tesz tönkre és ránt a barlang mélyébe. A végső lapka az utolsók közé van keverve, így a lényeg, hogy a timerként működő, kör végén felhúzandó eseménylapkák lejárta előtt elérjünk a kijárat lapkára. Ha elfogynak az események, akkor minden kör végén dobni kell a kockával, és ha nem sikerül, barlangászunk az enyészeté lesz.
Summa summarum, sok újdonság nincs, viszont hozza a hangulatot. Ránk nagy hatással van az egész, igen gyorsan beránt. Nem hiszem, hogy mindenkinek való, de nagyon érdemes kipróbálni, a videókon keresztül nem feltétlenül jön át a hangulata.

About as good as full co-op play gets. Nothing exceptional in terms of an experience, but completely solid. Less infuriating than Pandemic can be, and requires intelligent hedging/advanced planning. Like Pandemic, it feels immersive. Facilitates the "work together or die" cooperative spirit.

But of course, despite that, the die can still kill you. At very least those risks feel somewhat measured (wait for the specialist to get there to help or save time and do it yourself). But the game is pretty, was fairly priced, and is an equal combination of tense, engaging and relaxing. It will hit the table often.

RATING: 5
Enjoyable, light tile-laying game. Play is more 'survive until the last tile' than exploration. Small amount of tension and push-your-luck from a limit on number of turns and penalties for trying to go more quickly. Works for 2p taking 2 characters each. Due to 'miss a turn' type mechanics I can imagine it would be a frustrating play with only 1 character each.

First play managed to (barely) all escape.  Was good fun, but nothing to pull us back for another immediate try. We had a fair amount of discussion about rules so may have misinterpreted some.

Quality is so-so. Excellent-appearing artwork, but far too dark in practice which makes play harder.

Rulebook leaves a lot to be desired - there are things in the box not mentioned at all, rule sections are mixed up all over the place, so it is very easy to overlook something - there are around *6* summary cards full of iconography to remind players what is possible. (A lot of iconography to remember, but fairly intuitive once you start.)

No box inserts so everything is now jumbled together in my copy. Bit annoying but can live with it; probably makes another game less likely.

This is very much a game that I personally can take or leave, but I got it totally with the family in mind.

Players are cave explorers that have fallen into a cave complex and must find their way out before their flashlights die! The cave complex is a stack of tiles with the exit shuffled into the last five tiles of the stack. Every turn a new hazard card activates hazardous tiles on the board and if players don't get out before the last card is turned over they lose. Players cannot die, but can fall unconscious, and hazards serve to delay players at every opportunity. It plays a lot like Escape: The Curse of the Temple, but without the real-time aspect. Every caver has an enhanced action and a passive ability, so divvying up responsibilities is a big part of doing well. The three small expansions are not just extra characters but alter objectives as well, which could be interesting. I'm satisfied that this will see play and be enjoyed for a while.

We finally had our first two games of Sub Terra yesterday and boy, did we have fun! We eventually even managed to win the first game (easy mode of course), but the second game went into the opposite direction straight from the beginning. The game does an excellent job in splitting the group against their will and getting the cavers miles away from each other. But even when one caver, hunted by two horrors, experienced a tile sequence like "horror turn, cave-in straight, cave-in turn, ledge (2 turns to succeed throw rope and another fail to hide), and finally end up in a horror-dead-end", we were laughing a lot about the markedly bad luck, especially when the third horror spawned directly on the just explored dead-end tile, which took so much effort to reach through the ledge. Eventually we even managed to get the guy out of there (he was engineer with 2 bombs left, and the exit tile was 4 tiles away), but the other guys did not make it, which is funny again, as the Engineer was forced to be idle the entire 2nd half of the game, while the other guys tried to survive and build a way back to the engineer.

So wow, this was a lot of fun with a lot of laughter and we will for sure try our luck again (including the expansions then) at our next boardgame night!

This was a game that I'd almost kickstarted, and I'm really glad that I didn't. We tried it out at BGGcon, and it just felt very meh. There was SO much randomness, and while that can be a good thing in co-op games, it pretty much meant that whether or not you did well was determined by luck of the dice/card/tile pulls. I can see the appeal, but there was ultimately too much luck for me to be interested in playing again unless someone else really wanted to.

A fun little tile placement cooperative game with a theme that goes from fairly harmless to downright sinister at the drop of a hat. Juggling the need to spread out and explore to find the exit fast enough but then getting as many explorers as possible to said exit before the time runs out is a really fun challenge.

Wonderful cooperative game that deserves your attention. The production values are fantastic. I know some have complained that the tiles are hard to see, but I've yet to find it be a problem. The game is simple but there are lots of push your luck decisions to be made and the tension continually builds creating a very exciting end game. For anyone that's enjoyed Flash Point or Forbidden Island, I thoroughly recommend this game.

Solid and very thematic subterranean cave exploring co-op with cool role powers. The mechanics create a good feeling of escalation as the tunnel suffers floods, cave-ins, gas etc. Nothing too fiddly, nothing very new, just to-the-point effectiveness. 

If yoy enjoy Forbidden Desert, Forbidden Island and the like, I really don't know why you wouldn't enjoy this one. Also works well solo.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Interesting decisions, although more luck involved than I anticipated. I was fortunate to mostly draw hazard cards not yet represented on the map, so the only thing I really had to deal with was cave-ins. You definitely want to run a minimum of four characters. One will never make it out alive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
++ Simple to explain, short rules
++ Short(ish) game length
+ Graphic design
+ Nice production quality

-- Few meaningful decisions to make
-- Poor use of die rolling mechanism
- The game brings no fresh ideas to the table
- Few different types of tiles
- Some tiles are dark and it's not instantly apparent if there's a wall or not.
- Played the 1st game on the "expert" difficulty and won
- 8 pages in the rulebook are used to list KS backers :/

Played with 2, controlling 2 characters each. With so few things to do, would likely rate even lower if played with 6.

The game isn't bad, but it seems to be highly overrated. (Rated 8.7 at the time of writing this comment).

RATING: 6
A 1-6 player cooperative, tile-laying, push-your-luck, exploration game set in a dark cave.

This game would be pretty decent if it didn't suffer from two very poor mechanics: 

1) The game is almost entirely decided by luck, both in terms of what tiles you draw (and in what order) as well as luck of the dice. For example, if you end your turn on a cave-in tile you can push you luck and draw another tile only to end-up on another cave-in (or similarly dangerous hazard). Another example is if you need to climb up a cliff, you can spend turn after turn futilely rolling dice in an attempt to get the result you need, being unable to do anything else in the process.

2) This game effectively has player-elimination. If you get separated from your group (which will often happen, especially with lower player numbers), you can become incapacitated and skip your turn FOR THE ENTIRE REST OF THE GAME!!! This is truly unforgivable in this modern age of board-gaming and is a very common occurrence in my experience (it has happened to at least one player in every game I have played so far).

Played a couple of times. The game is 'ok'.  Its not a bad game but just didn't grab me.  In both games, there was always one player that decided to go off and do their own thing.  They then became unconscious and whined to be rescued, despite in the second game every other player telling it wasn't going to end well ahead of time.
Could be more fun with different players who work together in a coop game.

We were initially quite excited about this, as a sort of cross between pandemic and Carcassonne.  In reality we found it lacked tension and we didn’t really find it absorbing in the way we hoped.  I also disliked that it needs you to play two characters each at two player, and so after several plays of the base game we decided to let it go.

RATING: 7.8
Overall: Fantastic cinematic gaming experience let down by mediocre game components. 7.8/10

Gameplay: Fun and memorable. If you treat the game as a cinematic gaming experience, the delivers in every regard. Luck is a main but crucial factor of the game, which may turn off some euro players. 

Components: Awesome meeples and character pieces. Tiles looks incredibly impressive under black light but were unfortunately too dark to see properly during the day.  Horror tokens were disappointingly plain. The tile holder doesn't fit in the box when assembled, which begs the question: why it was included in the first place when a better insert would have been the superior option. The components overall, submerses the players into it's intended environment exceptionally well. 

Replay value: 8 different characters + expansions gives it great replay value as every game is guaranteed to be a different experience.   

Misc: One downside is the possibility of early character elimination and hence player downtime. Playing this game with 2 or 3 players mitigates this by giving every player 2 different characters to play with.

Kickstarter, Deluxe edition (=Collectors edition (=base game, three expansions, and two books) plus character miniatures). Cooperative dungeon crawler for 1-6 players. The party has fallen into a cave full of dangers. Explore the cave and find the exit before the flashlights runs out of batteries. Okay as a solitaire, but not great (a bit to simple for that). Works quite well with two players, but probably best on four or more. Rules and mechanics are really easy to learn (even with the expansions, and it's best to use them all). The characters specialize in different fields (some more useful than others) adding variation to the game. Still the game is a bit to long and after a while the characters start repeating the same maneuvers. But the overall feeling is great and the designers really put their hearts into the game. Enjoy with a few friends and drinks on a dark night. Preferrably with some dim UV-lights only (although the tiles are printed a little to dark for this to work).

RATING: 6
Sub Terra is a cooperative exploration game ala Escape: the Curse of the Temple where the adventurers split up in a cave and try to explore through a stack of tiles before time runs out.  Instead of the challenge of realtime and rolling dice, players need to survive a number of obstacles including floods, cave-ins, tremors, and monsters.  If a player runs out of life, they are knocked unconscious until another player comes and heals them.  The players get a gold medal if all players escape, then silver and bronze if 1 or 2 players are left behind, or a loss if 3+ players are left behind.

The game does a few things well.  There are variable player powers that felt interesting and decently balanced.  The theme and time pressure felt pretty strong.  There were some good moments where we had to debate whether we should go back to save someone or just leave them behind.

However, there is a major problem that ruined the game for a few of the players.  While the game doesn't have true player elimination (you never die, but are knocked unconscious), it's fairly easy (and somewhat unpredictable) to get knocked unconscious.  It's conceivable that on your second turn you might get knocked out through no fault of your own and have to wait 10 or 20 minutes, or potentially the rest of the game before you can take another action.  IMO, this isn't a deal-breaker since it is an open information co-op ala Pandemic, so unconscious players can still contribute to the team.  But, because of this, I suspect that the game is best played 3 player with each player controlling 2 character.  That way, if one of your characters gets knocked out you can still contribute.

It has a pretty big flaw that will turn off a lot of gamers, but I didn't mind it (probably because I didn't get knocked out very long) and had fun playing.

Late KS Pledge for Deluxe Edition w/ Horror Minis Add-on. Received on 12/26/17 in perfect condition.  I figured the UV flashlight was just a gimmick, until I saw how it clarified the tile structure (paths vs walls)... probably a fix for the "too dark of tiles" problem that many people seem to be having.  Rulebook is short and easy to digest.  Really enjoying the game after a few plays.  The Deluxe box was huge and wasted a lot of space... ended up trashing it; the entire game takes up very little space on the shelf.  My wife and I find the minis completely unnecessary; gameplay is perfectly enjoyable without them. Update: I did start using the horror minis on the 3rd play through and enjoy their menacing presence on the board.

Played solo a bit on tabletopia and sooo glad i backed this one. Cant wait to get the physical copy and the expansions! Could see this becoming an all time favorite. 

Theme comes through very strongly and the game always involves some very tense moments.

Different characters and random cave layout add a lot of variety across plays. The different difficulty levels work really well and feel more robust and well thought out than other co ops.

The most similar game is pandemic with a touch of betrayal at the house on the hill, this feels more thematic an more exciting than pandemic and more strategic than betrayal.

This is a great little tile laying co-op game. 
The tile artwork is a little on the dark side in places, but this doesn't exactly ruin the game. I love the little caver Meeples. 

The event deck adds some good tension and can really screw you over. The Horrors also dial up the tension. There is a lot of luck in this game but it is a lot of fun and simple enough to be played as a family game. 

Of a similar weight to Flash Point I would say.

Almost like an upgraded Castle Panic with the addition of spell cards that will aide in the tournament style free for all against the Orcs.  I backed the Kickstarter, and actually really liked the mage guys that looks like they are sticking up their middle finger.  Very funny in my book, and kinds of make sense since they are facing the mages who are attacking them from the tower.

This game took a lot of flack when it came out due to the nature of it's kickstarter and the similarities to Castle Panic...  However, don't let that sway you away from what is a great little game!

I love the deck building and the semi-cooporative (but hyper-compeditive) nature of the game play.

I like this game. Every game feels a little different depending on what creatures get pulled to start and what fate cards come up. I play with my boys mainly (7, 9, 12). They all get into it, but their attention can wane near the end so we rarely count points. Still fun though. 

Playing with two players is different than three, is different than four. Your options become limited with more players (can't teleport as often to places one might like to). I like playing with every number of players.

The extra modules (extra bonus rewards on the back of the chart and the secret challenges) also spice it up.

Only complaint is that it's a bit fiddly to set up and my boys need to keep being reminded to set out a new monster each turn.

After each game, I always want to play more. A fun, casual game that balances choices, luck, and interaction.

Realmente divertido, mezcla una mecanica muy vista como es el Deck building con otra muy poco frecuente como es los juegos de asalto. Hecho en falta algo mas de variedad en los hechizos, pero ya hay expansiones para arreglarlo.

I am not a fan of Castle Panic but I LOVE this game! The two main facets are collecting victory points by killing incoming Orcs and building your spell deck up to make killing the larger Orcs possible.  The game has a good arc to it whereas you all start out basically the same but then you can quickly differentiate yourself by what you choose to advance on your "Trophy boards" and what spells types you acquire to give you powerful combos.  There is a bit of screw your neighbor in this game where you can take away another players victory points by running orcs into their side of the tower.  This game is a perfect fit for me and my game group. 10!

I particularly like the enhancement sub mechanic within the deckbuilding portion of the game. Being on a clock based on board events has an interesting effect on action choices. I think the components are just fine. Not every game needs plastic miniatures.

Fun orc killing deckbuilding. Light, but with enough combi possibilities to keep all gamers occupied.
There're enough possibilies to hurt other players to make it more than just a one man show.

I am a sucker for (most) deckbuilders, so natrually I had to get this game when I heard it combined deck-building and competetive tower defense together. It doesn't disappoint, either. The idea is that you hop around the hexagonal centre tower while using your spell cards to zap...uh, orcs (of course) for VPs. The stronger effects of spell cards can only be triggered by powering them up them with others (colour-matching, basically), and some cards will let you move or get extra draws if you use them in this way.

One relatively minor issue is that there's little consequence for letting orcs reach the central tower (it just reduces the endgame VP worth of that particular orc type, unless you happen to be standing right in front of them). It's mainly a frenzied point-grab with some tactical movement blocking.

RATING: 7.7
Is this Castle Panic?
No, it's not. It looks like it, but it's a different enough game to stand on its own.

And it stands on its own pretty well as it is a fun game.
Deck-building your spells to get the most out of your turns to crush the most creatures to score the most points. Lots to be done.

Works well enough with 2 players, but improves with more.

First i thought cool, the name of the game is Orcs, Orcs, Orcs.. must be, ya'll play orcs storming a castle..

Nope, not even close.. you're all magicians building a deck to see who's better in killing orcs.. so you're defending the castle..?

Nope, if orcs reach the castle the VPs for that particular sort of orc are diminished..!!?!!

Seriously, i felt like false advertising.. the board looks like this pretty fun tower defence game & all you do is vying for VPs with no consequences whatsoever..?

Someone at Queen Games should think about a change in career.

Another cheapo company doing whatever possible to not make plastic mini's. Looks like a full price game with garbage components. When will they learn? You get more for the spend in a Happy Meal or a children's coloring book. Next they should make the cutouts out of toilet paper and you get to draw your own map ( crayons not included).

This is a competitive tower defense game that reminds many of Castle Panic, a cooperative tower defense game that I have not played so I can't comment on their similarities or differences. It's not a bad game. But...
It seems every now and then professional publishing houses go completely wrong with the functional design/look of their games. This game uses four colors for making difference between different stuff, and that's red, yellow, green and blue. Players have these four colors. Cards have these four colors. The 6 types of orcs have 3 of these colors. Too bad these have nothing to do with each other - why could they not find 7 more colors to avoid confusion?
And then there are the icons and small images on player aids and tokens - they are confusing, inconsistent and indiscernible. Too bad, because otherwise the game is a harmless and okay fun.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Enjoyed my first play of this tower defense game where everyone is in it for themselves and trying to hurt everyone else's efforts by either cursing them or driving in orcs of the type they've already collected to lose them points. Play nice and this game is fairly boring. Play with an edge and this one can be entertaining. There is a bit of deckbuilding and special abilities come into play when you've taken out two of the same type of orc. Looks a lot like Castle Panic but the gameplay is not in the least bit cooperative. There are a fair bit of fiddly bits.

I found this a fun charming game that doesn't take very long to or play. The rule book leaves a lot to be desired in terms of sentence structure but once you know the game you don't need to reference it again which is nice. The deck building mechanics are very simple and I would strongly suggest using this game as a tool to teach deck building to someone who is used to other types of board games. I would recommend playing with more than two people as the two player games I've played left the players a little under powered compared to the game. The game pieces are layered cardboard which I don't tend to like so we will see how it holds up over time but ultimately the game is fun to play and doesn't take a lot of time investment.

After one play I am convinced that there is quite a lot of strategy in this game. It gives the appearance of a cooperative game with hordes of orcs rushing towards the players' magicians in the central castle. However, as the winner is the one who kills the most valuable orcs, if the other magicians get a bashing from the orcs, it's no skin off my nose!

The comparisons to Castle Panic definitely exist here, though this one isn't very tense at all in comparison. It's everyone for themselves, though there aren't a ton of ways to screw with your opponents. There's a strong deck-building element here that's very similar to The Big Book of Madness, but not nearly as compelling. Aside from beefing up your deck around spells you specialize in (Which is something that always annoys me, because I feel railroaded into buying certain cards based on my character), there's very little going on here. You kill monsters to unlock perks, and there's a weird stock market mechanism for points scoring at the end. I don't know...this was just a weird mish-mash of mechanisms that was absolutely forgettable.

I'm all for high quality components but you should never rate a game a 1 without having played it based just on the quality of the components. I'm not kick starting this but don't down rate a game for something silly, Hoss Cardwright hope this helps counterbalance the display rating.

Good game with young folks. Picked it up for a song during the massive and ongoing Queen fire sale on Amazon.  Much better than expected and will pull it out with the nephew-in-law.

The game reminded me a lot of Castle Panic, not only because of the Tower 'defending' mechanism, but also because of the fact that it are also Orcs who invade the tower. Apparently Orcs like invading towers :-)

The game itself. Well, like HiG is for me a brand which stands for a certain game type, Queen is that also. So in fact I can just say it's a typical Queen game :-). This means it's more of a family game and some luck is involved. Good thing is they added 3 modules in the base game, which can spice things up a bit. This they should do for all of there games imho.

I do not know the game, but I must object to their clear attempts to create brand confusion with Castle Panic.

15-02-2015. Rated after 1 play. Orcs X3 is a fun game in which you 'defend' YOUR side of the tower, while trying to make sure they monsters hit your opponent. 

It resolves around a deck-building mechanism, which allows you more actions. More strong attacks. You get points for killing monsters, but the more they hit the tower, the less they score .. 

So yeah, the game was fun. But I could see it become samey quickly. I think the game lacks legs unless significant expansions are put on the market soon.

Solid game. Easy to pick up and great as a family game with children.
The expansion adds more variabiliy and replay value.

Ugh. Bland and dull and extremely overpriced for cardboard and no minis. Its not that it needed minis, but it costs almost as much as if it did. Tired mechanics and a pasted on theme with not a lot to recommend it since it masquerades as a tower defense but doesn't have any real consequences for the monsters reaching the tower (except that monster type now is worth fewer points). I'm disappointed in you, Queen Games. Expansion made it marginally better, but I'll pass. There are just too many games out there that are much superior that do the same things better. At least castle panic has more in-game consequences. The artwork is good, I'll give it that.

My only real complaint is that it's kind of fiddly, and IMO, a bit overproduced. It's still a lot of fun, and I prefer it over the similar-feeling 'Seasons'.

Not sure what to think.  Fiddly to get started.  Once up, it could have been smoother.  Rules were fine, but it seemed like the explanation for adding new magic cards could have been clearer (it's part of a card action??).  The game felt clunky and repetitive.  However, oddly, my wife said she liked it okay.  Odd.  Too confusing for my boys and it was purchased for them.  What to do with it?

don't have the feeling to really make my deck better before the game ends.
the mechanic with the small tokens and place large figures are slowing the game down... guess better just big round tokens for both in one.
and you only have two or 3 actions... also makes your turn kinda boring in my feel.

Glad that they didn't go with miniatures - that would have doubled the price, and I don't go for many $100 games.  Fun game with tower defense, a little deck building, and the chance to mess with your opponents.

Good, fun game with solid deck building and leveling up elements. Only played with 2 players so far. No reason not to use both of the included modules right away. Don't listen to the haters - it's not like Castle Panic except for the board layout.

For those who think this is Castle Panic, it's not. Munchkin Panic maybe, but still, no. This isn't a co-op game and it uses deck-building mechanics which are totally different than the Panic game mechanics. It would be like calling Trains a knockoff of Dominion. Okay, there's a tower in the middle and monsters rush at it, and you need to stop them. That's all the basic ingredients for a tower defense game,so this game seems to fit the bill. The deck building aspect is intriguing and injects strategy into the game.  A "solid 7" Euro in my book.

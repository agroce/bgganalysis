Nothing wrong with this- fairly simple, and the theme itself meant nothing to me.  Just a simple, basic board game.  The terrain system was different than I usually see on a non-traditional miniature game.

Con una única partida al escribir esto, creo quees un juego muy divertido siendo el genero uno que no me llama demasiado. Eso sí, entiendo que el azar/caos es tan algo que puede desquiciar a jugadores más serios.

I was really surprised that my fiancé was a huge fan of the Mars Attacks movie. She saw this game at a local store and immediately wanted to buy it. I was super confused because we normally play light games...war gaming is a totally different genre for us!

I found a used copy here and we absolutely love this game! For a miniatures war game this is a perfect introduction. It feels more like a board game with rich depth. On the basic side you move pieces and roll for combat results. You get to set up the terrain which is fantastic and the miniatures look really nice. 

This game inspired my fiancé to explore painting minis so overall I'm thrilled about this game. 

I personally tend to get overwhelmed by complicated rule systems but there's something inside me that desires to tackle those type games. However teaching them to other people is such a obstacle. This game feels like the perfect balance for easy to teach, quick to set up and fun to play.

A little silly but still fun to play. The cards make it fairly chaotic, but tie back in to the silliness of the game and the movie. I have only played the base game.

RATING: 8
Simple, quick system allows varied, focused scenarios. Lots of dice rolling, also very easy for non-wargamers to get into. Very well produced and looks good even unpainted, though the clips for the scenery are still feeble and prone to breaking. Really needs Mantic to pull their fingers out and update the FAQ as the rulebook is a bit lazy.

RATING: 7
This serves as a great introduction to smaller tabletop wargaming that newer players will quickly latch on to. The rules are nicely streamlined and easy to understand and the box contains everything you need to play a wide variety of games. The narrative aspect provided by the heroes is the icing on the cake.

Picked up my kickstarter copy at GenCon. Loving the crazy silly events that happen during battles. Can't wait to get the rest of the stuff for this game.

I'm impressed by how easy the game is to teach...

Update: 
I've been playing through the first 5 scenarios and they keep getting better. In the past I've not been happy with the quality of Mantics miniatures but the minis and terrain look really good painted! I'm playing solitaire and loving it. I'm looking forward to seeing how the AI decks work but so far it works well even without them. 

I've played all 10 scenarios now and I'm looking forward to the new releases. This game reminds me a lot of Rivet Wars in its simplicity, silliness, and beautiful production quality.

Bought 8/4/2017, including Humanity Resists expansion. 

Simple and easy, although LOS is definitely in the eye of the beholder in 3D...

Some simple house rules for added realism:

OBSTACLE: An obstacle is a terrain element that is at least 50% as tall as  the moving model, but not as tall as (or taller than) the moving model. Obstacles (and other linear or semi-linear terrain elements) should be placed on square edges. Crossing an obstacle costs one extra MP. Land vehicles smash through obstacles unless specifically prohibited. 

LOS: SHOOTING is prohibited when the LOS passes within 1/2" of a friendly model.

COVER: If the target is directly behind (i.e., touches) a terrain element that hinders the shooter's LOS and is made of of a solid material (dirt mound, sand bags, boulder, brick or concrete well, vehicle), add 1 SURVIVE die (or even 2 in specified cases).

OPPORTUNITY FIRE: Any model that has yet to be activated is eligible for opportunity fire if a target MOVES in its LOS, even momentarily, and even if the LOS is hindered. Its owner must declare opportunity fire and resolve.  Opportunity fire does not allow AIM, unless the model was previously placed and stayed in overwatch. Opportunity fire causes a model to be activated. 

OVERWATCH: Any model with SHOOT ability can be placed in overwatch when activated--place two activated markers near it as a reminder. Overwatch allows a model to AIM and SHOOT as opportunity fire. Overwatch also allows a model to SHOOT at a shooter who has not moved, but is in LOS, and only after it shot. If the model does not opportunity-fire, it can be left in Overwatch the next turn (leave both activated markers). A model in overwatch that opportunity-fires loses its ability to opportunity-fire again in the same round--remove the second activated marker.

No, wait! This is the most basic, imbalanced, random miniature game I've ever played.

Two player Army guys versus martians in a point-and-shoot grid movement on  a paper mat. I worry that the 3-D terrain obstacles will get in the way of players, knocked over, block view, and get fiddly with setup. Also might get fiddly moving chits with the miniatures. Simple modified 8-sided combat system where 8's explode for more successes and a cool mechanic to play a set collection of cards to boost an attack or effect.

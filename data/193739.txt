Jogo de leilão com uma mecânica bem, bem esperta (como era de se esperar do Feld). Não ajuda o fato de que a arte é bem feia e o tema não me chama a atenção. Talvez seja tempo demais de partida pelo que ele oferece de satisfação.

RATING: 6
1 play / 5 players

LIKE: Cutthroat auction, very interesting. I really enjoyed the hard decisions and pushing your luck to see if you could get away with snagging a cheap card.

DISLIKE: Not much engine building, which causes money and points to be very tight each round. Cutthroat, which can turn some people off. I also think the size of the box works against this game. It could be a compact game, easy to carry, but instead they tried to make it large, which takes up room in game bags.

OVERALL: I liked it, but with some caveats. All players need to know the cards, which means showing players the A deck and D deck. It also felt similar to Keyflower and Ra, so there might not be a need to own all three.

I want to play again to see how I feel about it.

Exactly the same game as The Speicherstadt except for that Jorvik has some extra special cards that break the basic rules and a second row of cards on which only one person can bid for on each card. Unfortunately these rule changes do not make the game any better. In contrary they break the elegance by introducing super powerful instant effects and increasing chaos. The game is still playable, not just as good as the original.

The bottom line is that bidding is fun.

RATING: N/A
Abstract:

Pros:
+ Jorvik already includes the expansion JARL (formally known as Kaispeicher which is very hard to find). Besides adding rare goods, the expansion makes the game much more interesting by adding another layer (row of cards) to the bidding. 
+ Twisted bidding system where players actually raise the demand. Players either bid to get a card or bid to make it more expensive for other players.
+ ...bluffing: players try to hide what they really want from each other
+ High interaction: prices are determined by the players via bidding, players try to increase the prices of cards that other players want
+ Players who pick cards from the extra row (expansion) have to pay more
+ Limited money: each decision has a big impact (goods-to-money conversion cards can be very helpful)
+ Players can convert goods into other types of goods at a higher ratio to mitigate if they do not get what they need
+ Special power cards are great and spices the game up
+ Order of the biddings is very important because players may run out of money until the last bidding (save money or get the card?)
+ Easy to teach, easy to play (just play first game with the base game KARL)
+ Well written rules
+ Plays well with 3-5 players

Neutrals:
# Theme is okay (however, I like the theme in Speicherstadt much more - I am from Hamburg)
# Artwork is okay (colorful and clear but I do not like the art from most of the pictures and persons on the cards)
# Turn order is very important: first player can be easily blocked
# Replayability: all cards come into play each game, there is nothing new per game, just the order of cards is different
# Randomness and luck depends on the order of the drawn cards including which goods are available. Moreover, the raid events are hidden somewhere in the draft deck
# Like most auction games, it needs some plays to get a feeling for the value of the cards
# Being first player is a disadvantage because other players are always able to overbid
# Tasks can be hard to get / achieve if other players pay attention and block the players from getting the task or the required goods
# Expansion adds take-that cards (e. g., thieving)
# Scoring happens between rounds and at the end of the game

Cons:
- Long playing time: bidding and buying cards feel repetitive over time, however, game runs very smoothly
- Very aggressive bidding system that encourages denial play without consequences since players who win the bidding do not have to buy the card (mean, nasty) 
- Confusing iconography for goods/colored cubes
- 2-players work, but is the most cutthroat because players spend most energy to block this one other player (bluffing is much harder). Moreover, fighters have a bigger impact if always the same player is rewarded or punished.

Jórvik is a reimplementation of The Speicherstadt (2010), by Stefan Feld. It really is the same game mechanics with different theme and includes the expansion. So there is not really much to say about this game than I didn't already said about The Speicherstadt. I enjoyed the expasion part, so I gave it a little more rating than the first.

I had a good time playing this game. It takes a couple of times to get the strategy down but after that it' quite fun. My favorite part of the game though is the art. This is absolutely a beautiful game. From the individual characters to the back of the board, very pretty artwork.

RATING: 6
Auction game. It was interesting... but it felt super short in money. Only getting two dollars a turn - which meant if you were super lucky you might win 2 of the auctions. There was a weird element for the top half of the board where the first player to select a card was basically giving up a worker to remove that card from the game (as it was going to be too expensive).

RATING: 8
For those who enjoy auction games, Jorvik deserves to be played at least once.  Why?  Because the auction mechanic feels unique and interesting to play around with, and for better or worse, my goodness, this may be the "tightest money" auction game ever released to the general public.  My first game was a four player game.

Does playing around with tight money for an hour and a half feel refreshing?  Admittedly, not so much, but tight money in this game does manage to create a very interesting "player prediction" decision space.  

In particular, in order to understand what your rivals are going to do in the multiple auctions that they have placed their meeples in each round, you really need to ponder just how tight their money supply is:  with that amount of money, which of the auctions that they are participating will they choose to pay for? For me, this felt very interesting to think about.  

But, I can also see how players who don't want think about this would find Jorvik very frustrating, because let's face it, tight money IS frustrating.  With all these cards to buy, there is an overwhelming feeling of I want to buy MORE cards!

In the final analysis, it is my sense that Jorvik and its predecessor likely needed a bit more tinkering around the edges to bring them into their prime or optimal state.  If I were to redesign this game, I might tune it such that the money is ever so slightly less tight, and I would find a way to mitigate the luck of the draw with respect to the cards in the top row.

Yet, I love that this is a Feld design, because its tightness, just seems so out of character for a designer best known for his point salads.   Perhaps he was in a "Year of the Dragon" (another tight Feld design) mood when designing this one.  LOL.  

Thinking about the pleasure I got out of Jorvik causes my mind to wander to other quirky games that I am curiously fond of... including:  Vanuatu, Lascaux, Don, Booty and Packet Row.

I am going to give Jorvik an 8 for its sheer audacity in auction design, amusing screwage potential, and for me, VERY interesting player prediction space.  I would like to try Jorvik with 5 to see if the quirky auction space gets even crazier!

Money is scarce (at first) so you have to choose wisely, and trust me, this game has presented me with some of the hardest decisions in boardgame history. I love the way you auction in this game, it's very unique. This game is great.

RATING: 8.6
I must say that I really enjoyed this re-theming of a Feld classic I had not previously owned or played. The auction mechanisms are interesting, especially in Jarl mode, and pose a lot of thought as to how you'll proceed, and the increasing complexity of the combos and the different paths to VP really start to pile on as you get deeper down the draw stack. Many of the cards feel thematic to their purpose, and those Picts are forever hanging over your heads! Elegant and thinky.

As excellent as the reimplemented original game, The Speicherstadt.  Played the base game (I have never played the Kaispeicher expansion).  In my opinion, both the theme and art were far more interesting in the original.  But of course this is just a personal question.  The game is just superb, with one of the best auction mechanisms I have met.

Money is so tight it almost feels a little like work, but I may not have acquired the right characters that provide some extra cash. Enjoyed the bidding mechanic in this game, and will have to give this another play for further impressions. UPDATE: 2nd play I realize you'll never have enough money. It's positioning, timing, and a little bluffing. Outstanding resource collection, set collection, and bidding game. Great Feld effort!

Just Another Soulless Feld game. And has a viking "theme" to boot.

A feld-y game where you grab stuff and convert it to points, while avoiding bad stuff from happening to you. Feld did this much better in other games before and he is just rehashing his stuff now.

On the other hand, if you liked and/or is considering buying "Die Speicherstadt", this game is an improved, cleaner version and has the expansion threw in right out of the box. Yay, I guess?

Two very novel bidding mechanics in this one, and when you combine a really tight money management aspect and the ability to push up the costs of other peoples cards overall this is a tight fairly thinky game. 

There is an aspect of bluffing as you do not want to make it obvious which card(s) you want to acquire for the turn or else others can (and will) push them beyond you ability to afford them.

Cutthroat auction game with novel unique mechanics that is enjoyable on occassions. Can feel a little overlong.

Sold in 2018.

I would always prefer to play 'The Speicherstadt' instead of Jorvik. Jorvik seems less balanced, especially when resources apear on the upper half of the board. I really like the auction system of 'The Speicerstadt' but I equally dislike the second auction system in which players tend to give up a worker to remove a card from the game. (The first player who chooses a card is almost sure he will not be able to pay for it.) That resolves in negative game play because it is cheaper to remove a card another players needs instead of paying for a card you need yourself. The lack of monney encourages this kind of play.

Slow players will play slow. Make sure you have snacks on hand.

But also, the reverse auction style is just beautiful. It takes all the bluffing and mindgames out of auctions while still leaving all the interaction and prediction in. (That prediction is where the slow play comes from, though; for fast players this might be fun but seem random?)

If they'd packed this in a Speicherstadt-size box it would be perfect. Well, perfect for the times I want a 3-5 player contract-fulfillment auction game. That comes and goes.

You may call me crazy, but this might me my favorite Feld.

I really like the unique bidding concept here, but it feels far too constrained, as money is so short that it completely stumps the gameplay. The Loki cards cause a lot of nasty screwage too. Beyond that, it's a simple, streamlined card game that plays quickly.

Interesting bidding mechanism and tight gameplay. Good design, but not for me. Too tight, too mean, too much counting other people's money, and messing them over. If you like playing highly competitive that's great, I don't enjoy it. 

Regarding theme I prefer the Speicherstadt for its uniqueness. Generic Vikings is boring.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (March 2017)

I generally like Feld games, but with The Speicherstadt I have always had mixed feelings so my desire to play Jorvik wasn’t very high. I must confess I haven’t played the game along the Kaispeicher expansion but I will do it soon (that’s the reason I haven’t sold the game in the first place).

The rules are easy to teach, you can do it under 12 minutes. Gameplay is around 75 minutes.

The theme is based now around Vikings, I generally don’t like this theme (don’t know why) but it is paper thin and you don’t feel it though the game in any case.

I have only played the basic game, I hope it gets a lot better with the full game. Still it is an interesting game with non-obvious decisions, basically, where to place your workers, but you need to think some aspects (do you want that card or are you bluffing a little? Do you want to increase the price of a card?). Money is very thigh so the decision of where to spend it isn’t obvious and that’s my favorite part of the game. Having said that, Jorvik isn’t as fun as I thought it would be. 

Best with 4 players.

When I played Jorvik I thought the game was streamlined in some ways (perhaps it is), but, for the life of me, I cannot spot any differences (mechanically speaking) between both games, still, its been a long time since I last played The Speicherstadt.

As The Speicherstadt, and most of all Kaispeicher were out of print and hard to get, I’m surprised to see Jorvik in many sales. I though the game was going to be a huge hit, but I’m not sure this is the case.

Bottom line, Jorvik is a good re implementation of The Speicherstadt and Kaispeicher. I still have high hopes for the game. I need to play the complete game before deciding if I like it or not. I, obviously, won’t buy it as I already have the previous incarnation of the game.

Speicherstadt with a Viking retheme. I've only played the base game which is identical to Speicherstadt. Comment copied from the predecessor:

Speicherstadt is one of these games with a single idea that carries the game. In this case, it's a promising one. The trick is that there are multiple simultaneous auctions and players "bid" on one of them by placing one of their workers there. The price for the card rises with each additional worker placed with the first player having the privilege to buy first. If he declines he removes his worker and the following player can buy the card for one less.
It's an interesting mechanism warranting a few games to work it out. I'm not sure though if it is possible to consistently being in for the win. My feeling is that it is possible to be hosed completely without any fault just because things work out against you incidentally.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.85
Since it's just a retheme of a game I like, I like it as well. I do feel like a few small things were rebalanced well and I like what was formerly an expansion is now included with the base game. I have a feeling this would be better for 4+ players though. Three players felt a little too open all the time.

Great auction game, although to be honest I would have preferred the original theme of Spiecherstadt to the viking theme and artwork of the retheme. This would have definitely rated higher if it were just a reprint of the original, although I imagine I'm probably in the minority of people that would prefer a warehouse themed game! The game itself is great, tough bidding decisions and with very little money to bid it leads to agonizing decisions.

RATING: 7
I started a little cold on this Feld, but it's a game that has proven more rewarding with each play. The game plays well with 3-5 players, with different strategies for each player count. Like all good auction games, each session is different depending on what the players at the table value that time. The strength of the unique and simple bidding system is that you don't have to win auctions to effectively play this game -- in fact, it's sometimes better to win nothing than something and to rather drive up and eliminate cards for your opponents. Like Feld's other game, Rialto, this game takes one mechanism and hones it into a very tight, clean game.

I really like the whole pricing/auction mechanism. I'm not all that keen on the fact that it becomes a waiting game. But for all that, I enjoyed my first game and look forward to a second game (where we should have a better idea of how much things are worth).

Es geht darum, Spielkarten mit Ressourcen aller Art zu erwerben, indem man bei den jeweiligen Angeboten Schlange steht. Wer seine Spielfiguren zuerst hinsetzt, darf auch als erster kaufen, aber zu erhöhten Preisen. Wer später kommt, kann evtl. günstiger einkaufen, außer jemand vor ihm hat schon zugeschlagen. Da Geld Mangelware ist, fehlt es nach einem Vorhandkauf meist in der nachfolgenden Runde, so dass andere Spieler zum Zuge kommen können.
Das erhöht die Chancen für die Leute hinten in der Warteschlange. Möglicherweise stellt man sich auch hinten an, um die Vorangehenden in der Reihe aus dem Markt zu drängen oder ihnen höhere Ausgaben aufzuzwingen. Diese reizvolle Taktik- und Ärgerkomponente sorgt für viel Stimmung am Spieltisch.

The two-player game goes a bit long for my taste. That said, it's still a good auction game for two, and those are hard to find. I wish it didn't have the nasty attack cards. There aren't many of them, but I wonder if I could take them out without breaking the game.

Ugh. Not fun. Many things require cubes, but the cube ships tend to get sunken. You can't do much in this game, until the very end. Mean-spirited, and not in a good way.

The bidding system is clever in itself, though.

Indifferent.

OK game - the auction system is really clever and sometimes you need to put your meeple on a place even if you don't want/ or can't buy that card just to deny the card for someone else. The randomness of the cards and the fact that you don't know when they show up makes it a bit more luck-based. The card with 1 more coin every turn is really helpful but if you don't have enough money at the time, you're screwed. Good game but not perfect. Would like to try the more extensive game though to see what it offers.

RATING: 7.5
Each round of Jorvik features an interesting and cutthroat auction. But the economy of the game is so tight that you usually won't be able to afford more than 1 or 2 cards per round and some rounds you won't be able to buy anything at all.  In this case, you use your pieces to block other players -- decreasing the overall wealth across the whole table.  The result is an incredibly impoverished game.

RATING: 8
It's exactly what it claims to be; Speicherstadt + Kaispeicher with a new theme. I hadn't played the expansion originally, so this game did break a little bit of new ground for me in that area, but I found out that I still really like this auctioning system. The one real nitpick I have with the game is the graphic design, which is a real eyesore. I vastly prefer the Speicherstadt's clean and simple presentation compared to Jorvik's cards, which are crammed full of numbers and symbols. I'm sure with more plays it will grow on me, but it's still one of those things that made it more difficult to look at the various options. 

Regardless, this is a reprint of one of the best auction games ever made. Spyrium borrowed the bidding mechanism a bit, but Das Speicherstadt and now Jorvik use it in a better way. Yes, money can be very tight, but it evens out over the course of the game. The viking theme is...whatever. This could have honestly been anything, and once again, I prefer Das Speicherstadt's theme.

Too punishing and too many ways for other players to mess with you.

2017: 8. Brought the game home for the holidays and this went down really well with my parents and step-siblings. (Only playing the Karl version for now) Based on reviews I expected the game to be more cut throat and people to be a little more sore about getting their plans spoiled, but I think people just understand that this is the nature of the game.

I was mainly interested in the unique auction mechanism, but the design has other bits going for it as well. I think a key thing for me is that this is an auction game for people who don't normally understand auction games. The money is tight and the costs for cards pretty low, so it's *very* easy for everyone at the table to understand what's cheap and what's expensive. (1 is cheap, 2 is ok, 3 and up is expensive) This makes it easy for people to play pretty competently after the first game or so.

Looking forward to trying the Jarl version with more gamery gamers soon!

Ok - will play if in the mood.  We are a collector of Feld games and this one falls near the bottom.  It is simple but a lot of take that and strategy of the bidding type.  This is a good game but the game score has not been all that tight like the usual Feld games.  We ended up with a 10 point spread one game and a 30 point spread on another.

RATING: 9
People who complain about lack of money and resources don't understand this game -- at all! This is a game about outmaneuvering your opponents to get what you want/need. The key element of the game is certainly the bidding round. Thus, the strategy and tactics of when and where you place each and every Viking is crucial and is what makes this game great. People really need to play it several times to grasp the depth of each decision. (So leave the Jarl version out of it until then.) Certainly not a game for everyone. If you approach this as a simple "go out and buy whatever you want, just get there first you will hate this game. It is NOT a worker placement game. It is a highly tactical wrestling match.

tl;dr: solid game, not my favorite

I have played [thing=66505][/thing] (once, apparently) and remember appreciating the design. Apparently this game is identical, but with [thing=78750]the expansion[/thing] included and with new artwork. I had never played the expansion.
First of I must say that the box for this game is way over sized. It could probably have fit in the box of the original base game, but most publishers would put it in a Hans im Glück big box, not a Kosmos big box. So much air!
But that aside. How did I like the game? Well, I like the (very hard) choices that every turn brings. What order to place your workers where? When should you save your money for a card that comes up later? When to go all in on the top row (the bit that comes from the expansion, if I remember correctly)? Good, meaningful choices.
Yes, this is a solid design. But I don't love it. I don't know why, but it didn't click with me. I recognize the quality of the design, but it's not a game I would request often.

[thing=193739][/thing] is a reworking of [thing=66505][/thing], also adding the expansion for this one: [thing=78750][/thing]. It brings the highly thematic game of receiving goods, fulfilling contracts and fighting fire in the [thing=193739][/thing] port, to the shores of the vikings, yet again making a deeply thematic game. Some of what I just said isn't totally true.

[thing=193739][/thing] follows the same trend of its predecessor: is a game of bullying. Not auction. Think about an auction game in which you can increase the value and, once the other person drops out, you can do it too. No strings attached. It is just like "Eh, I didn't want it. I just don't want [i]you[/i] to have it". Is this sort of evil that Feld bring back once again.

My friends and I like [thing=66505][/thing], mostly because we are all bastards - we excel in making each other miserable - someone not winning is your win. Be ahead in points is for losers - we want fingers pointed to faces, curses and vendettas. Not the best environment for children.

[thing=193739][/thing] keeps this trend and adds a new layer to it, which came in [thing=78750][/thing]: a new line of cards, one more meeple to make everyone else more mad, and one extra coin per turn, which is sweet, and it was a pain to be first or second to play and have a single coin, knowing that you would suffer the whole round, likely not gaining a single card, and all your purpose there was being crossed by the others, putting their evil meeples behind yours, taking your stuff and laughing. Then you would receive one extra coin at the end, and a payment for the good time you gave to the others. And you would wait, eagerly, to give them the same treatment. Well, in [thing=193739][/thing] is a little harder for this to happen, as at least one meeple you will be able to handle.

The extra line of cards works a little differently: you take a card, put a meeple on it and add it to a line, then wait. Each card put there afterwards, increases the value of yours by one. At the end of the round, this extra line will be resolved last - and, as in the others, paying is optional. Most of the time, as in the real spirit of the game, players will take cards early only to prevent others from taking them, with close to zero intention to actually buying them - at least with 5 players, which truly the number of the beast for this game. This extra card puts more pressure in the the resolution of the other cards, as money, while a little more there, is still super tight, and all the time prioritizing and preparation will be necessary.

Overall, [thing=193739][/thing] had almost no chance of going wrong with us, as it is basically the same as [thing=66505][/thing] with some more features (new cards, little tweakings in balance, more types of goods, etc) - though it did increased in time, which isn't great, but not all that bad. It still requires being a bully, having a keen sense of timming, being able to prioritize and knowing when to pass and when to get.

Not a game for everyone, nor every time. But it works for us, and I recommend it for those that have the guts to deal with it.

Feld's take on an auction game. It's one of the better auction games. The resource management aspect leaves you thinking every turn. It's easy to learn and teach. The rulebook is very good as is the art. The theme is painted on. Doesn't feel "Feld". Lots of interaction. Two game modes allow you to gear toward your target group. A fun game. Not sure how often it will hit the table though.

The game is a re-design of Die Speicherstadt, which I've never played but heard good things about (I think it won a bunch of the Euro awards). The general gist is similar to a lot of "build an empire, get victory points" type games like Puerto Rico, Colosseum, 7 Wonders, Concordia, etc. -- the gameplay is MOST like Colosseum I would say. I know I love Colosseum, but unsurprisingly it was the Viking skin of this game that sold me.

Just helps to enforce my theory that pretty much any kids game by Habba can make an excellent drinking game for adults.

From the Review: I saw someone comment that adults enjoy this game as well. I looks like it could be fun. But I won't buy it until I try it and hopefully I will have some to play it with someday.

RATING: N/A
Neat idea for a kids game although I'm sure this would go over well with adults, especially as a drinking game! :) But the idea of lots of little balls rolling all over the place made me trade this one away before my kids were old enough to play. Combining two young kids and two cats with a game like this is just asking for trouble.

I know this is supposed to be children game, but I find it a bit boring. The components are crazy and using the plate is fun, but it's just too simple and light for my tastes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I give it a 6, mostly for the fun, not so much for the game.  It&#039;s cool to pan for &quot;gold,&quot; but once you get the hang of it, there&#039;s not enough variance to what you have to do to give it replayability.  And the whole scoring/betting/cashing in gold thing is wonky.  Still, you get to pan for marbles!  One of the few games that&#039;s basically as much fun to watch as it is to play... and, yeah, that&#039;s kind of a slam.

A very exciting and fun dexterity game of panning for gold.  There is a strong tension during every player's turn.  Quite excellent.  I would rate much higher except the game is excessively noisy.  I would have preferred a plastic or wood dish to do the panning instead of that aluminum monstrosity.

Excellent action game, very funny. Adults might use a strategy too whereby if everyone bets you&#039;ll keep some gold, you can just dump the pan and collect their bets. A must-buy game, a tad expensive though.

RATING: 6.4
A hard and very different dexterity game.  As common with HABA games, components outstanding.  Ages 6+ is right on.  I played the advanced game with claim cards, unlimited betting, and tricks.  Surprisingly the game lasted the same length, but was a little more complicated (of course) & interesting.  

Even though the claim area defined with a rope is large, we found many nuggets and stones escaped so that playing on a carpet is better.  House rule:  In the advanced game, every stone or nugget that lands outside the claim area costs a nugget.  That keeps the game from getting too wild.

A very unique dexterity game that has players panning for gold by way of stirring wood "stones" from a metal pan. other players place bets on how many gold nuggets the player will be able to save in the pan. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is unlike any game that I own or have ever played. The components are top notch and very well made. This game is ridiculous fun. It does require a bit of dexterity to play, but nothing major. Lots of action to be had with bidding and bluffing and trying to pan out the stones. Do note though that this game is a bit noisy due to the wooden marbles rolling around the big metal pan. I am VERY happy that I came across and found this game here on BGG. FUN, FUN, FUN!!!

This really is a pretty neat filler game. It has great bits, the dexterity for the gold panner is challenging, and the guess work for the wagering is fun. Plays pretty quickly, too. Good game all around, though definitely light.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun dexterity game that is worth it just to see folks swirling the marbles around waiting for the right pattern to bump out the black or grey marbles. The restrictions on betting help keep the game from becoming too one sided when someone is on a lucky streak.

Really cool components and a fun idea for a game, but there seems to be a disconnect between the mechanics and the theme.  I can understand it as a dexterity game - it is surprisingly difficult to get only the gold out of the pan.  But the core of the game is essentially a betting game, which when playing with kids essentially comes down to guessing.  This is not satisfying.

I really disliked this game, even though I won my first and hopefully only game. I was useless at the actual panning and it seemed to me too luck oriented given that you just bet on how well someone could actually get balls out of a tray or bluff as to how well they could.

A dexterity game that has great appeal to kids. It attempts to solve the mixed ages problem by adding a secret bet mechanism. The problem is that it's really hard for kids to keep gold in the pan, so if everyone bets 0, it's likely they'll rake in the player's money. The adult on their turn has a choice of trying to keep the gold in the pan or tossing it out, depending on what they think people may have bet. Once you get past the gold panning novelty, there's not much here, it gets repetitive and doesn't handle age mixes well.

As with most Haba games I've played, this was really enjoyable and I would love to play this with my kids.  This is a pretty sweet dexterity game that actually has some game to it.  It is surprisingly hard to get those damn beads off that plate.

RATING: 5.5
This is peculiar and unique game. It's the only dexterity game I know of that deals with getting specific kind of balls out of your plate (the technique includes tilting the plate and trying to put balls in the circular motion). But then there's also the betting element - people can try to bet how good will you do. 

Problem is: it's quite easy to get a hang of the technique because there's no time limitation. It might take you 10 minutes for one move, but then so it will (and the rest actually won't be bored). And then it's all about bluffing and reading people. Which is still actually a total mindfuck. I was completely lost, but I was laughing a lot. 

Oh and there's the cute raccoon to share some completely arbitrary luck. Which is neat as the game is more about the ride anyway. Definitely an unique game.

Weird [-]little[/-]huge dexterity game where players "pan for gold" by attempting to toss grey/black balls out of the pan while leaving the yellow ones behind.

What makes it a game is that the others secretly bet on how many they think the panner will be able to keep; more money comes from these bets than from the actual panning.

Great components and an interesting novelty. The panning is genuinely difficult, probably too much so for children. I wish I had a wooden fence as in the first edition, because the second edition's rope just doesn't want to lie flat.

RATING: 6
[HABA 2nd (2001) edition] {American West,; action, gambling} (7 as a children game) Klondike is a very interesting and unique children game that is also suitable for adults.  The interesting part of this game is that it's not a pure action game. Players have to guess what other wants and how other acts.

The sad thing is that it's easy to control with 3 nuggets. Klondike would be better if 4 nuggets are used because it's more difficult to control the panning; thus, it's funnier to play.

The parts are absolutely interesting. The pan is big enough and sturdy.  The 'balls' are colorful, sturdy and with appropriate weight.

Do not treat it a mere kid game. Adults have great fun with it and enjoy the game play real much. Apparently it looks like a dexterity game. Good skills at panning nuggets and stones give you certain advantage but it is not a must to manage the game. Smart betting and the ability to look through the bets are the key to win the game. Basic rules are fun enough for us. Have not yet tried the advanced rules which is more tailored for betting lovers.
Players often yell when the balls are rolling the rim of pan and almost getting out of the pan. Excellent choice for a party game with 4 players. Quick and fun, and addictive.
House rule: only one hand is used to pan gold nuggets. We found it more fun for both bettors and panner, by this slight and harmless uncertainty.

A game where you can bet all of your gold on someone else's physical dexterity (or lack thereof) is an interesting approach to children's entertainment.  In my day, they called it "gym", and they did it in school.

It is admittedly weird that you can throw your play (dump your pan) just to force a "zero" result.  But with adults, this possibility makes it a cagier game.

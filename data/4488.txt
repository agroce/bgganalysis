Obviously related peripherally to Lost Cities (which is a simpler version of this title). Not bad, not great... still, it's fun and provides some challenging decisions. It's a quick, light, filler. Looking at this any deeper is a mistake... just take it for what it is and you'll enjoy the brief experience.

Good game and quite strategic. Plays pretty quick ... even in best out of 3 format. One of my wife's favorites. Limited replay-ability. Nice artwork though.

A good non-collectible "premium card game", but I think the variety in deck construction is hurt somewhat by the clear differences in card strength (card balance).  Looking forward to Minotaur Lords.

It has the CCG feel during play without the dreaded 'collectible' aspect....and with the advanced rules, both players can swap cards from their deck with the white deck between games in a match.   Very cool.

A decent two-player. Sometimes it ends pretty anti-climatically. I like the trading of cards throughout the game though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
It's a fun game, but like many other Knizia games it's purely a mathematical battle. It does a better job of most of maintaining thematic elements but in the end it still feels like you're waging a battle of numbers. I like the interchangeability with the Minotaur lords deck. The cards are varied and every 'army' has a distinct strategic identity.

This is an ok game and that is about it.  The rules are slightly confusing, but the fact that most cards on both sides are the same makes me like this less than Minotaur Lords.

first and foremost, i think the game just isn't enough fun.  i have balance concerns as well, but that isn't really something that should be judged by people who are new to the game.  the mechanics sounded cool, idea sounded fine, i just think the game fell kind of flat.  i didn't really fear losses or celebrate wins.

RATING: 3
I guess I just don't like this style of game -- the proto-CCG. (It's why I'm not going to buy Jambo until I've tried it out.) I played five times and never really had any fun, so it got traded away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
As an earlier design in the 'custom card deck' style of games, it showed some great promise.  Its roots in something like Magic: The Gathering are present.  Game play and card powers are okay but not extremely well developed.  The game is highly subject to the random draw order of the 2 decks.  games can be very good and close if the cards come up right, but it there is a random mishmash the game's balance takes a beating.  With the advent of newer designs like Blue Moon, the game is likely to really show its age and limitations.  If you're a huge fan of this style of game, it can be worth getting on the table.  If you're looking for a game of this style, there are better options now available.

Not so bad! the card quality/artwork is very good and the gameplay it self is a pretty robust duel. Of course it lies on the thin line between collectible and standalone card game, but I liked my first plays. Not sure if one gets bored of the cards though.

Bought scarab lords in a lot on ebay and got a great deal.  After playing 5 or 6 games in one night, I like the game but have not really had the desire to pull it out again.  I read a review where someone described it as advanced battle line, and I think that is a great description.  I think I could grow to appreciate it more, but do not pull out 2 player games like this often.

Neat looking and I wanted to like it.  Mechanics were simple, lay down cards during designated phases.  Control territory with your minions, leaders and buildings.  Control territories for extra boosts.  A little take that, resource allocation and territoriality.  (is that a word?)  
Ultimately, the player decks are unbalanced.  Until balance, stay away.

Okay, I must be doing something wrong, but for this game to really get any rating at all, it MUST be possible for the blue deck to win, right?  In all my experieces, I don't believe the Blue Deck has ever won a game without addition of the white cards.  Ever.  I must be doing something wrong.

RATING: 6
I liked this game when it came out, as at the time a Knizia CCG-type game was a novelty (and very, very well balanced).  I discarded the box back in college, and just kept the cards and a scan of the board pieces on cardstock (which I chopped into six "cards").  Very portable this way.  Then Blue Moon came out and blew this away.

Haven&#039;t played this enough to give it a firm rating yet...may well go up to 7 or higher.  This game is a combination of an influence game like Battle Line and a CCG.  Somewhat difficult to learn because of moderately fiddly rules...definitely not the beautifully elegant system of Battle Line.  In the games of Scarab Lords I have played so far there has been a tendency to bog down...with both players able to make little progress.  Luck seems to play a pretty big part.  Winners in my games have been determined by depletion of the draw deck.  Still, this game intrigues me and I definitely want to keep playing it.

I picked this game up in a Math Trade. It falls in the same category as Gates of Loyang in the sense that I don't think I should like it as much as I do. Play time is quick and there's enough strategy to be interesting. It feels similar to Lost Cities, which I traded away, but more fun. Not one I'll pull out frequently, but a keeper for now. Erin likes it to. The box is much bigger than it needs to be. This could be a very portable game.

RATING: N/A
Played 3 times.  Once was almost 10 years ago though.  A fun game with interesting card play.  You really need to be familiar with the decks to get the most out of the game.  Religious supremacy feels more powerful than the other two, because it's so costly to come back from being cursed, and if you fail to wrest religious supremacy away from your opponent, they'll just re-curse you next turn.  I'm certain there are ways to avoid that with more familiarity with the game.  I definitely want to play again.

RATING: 5
Simple customizable card game.  Not bad for what it is, but it has some flaws.  Initial card draw is overly important and if one player gets a poor mix while the other does not, they will lose.  Can have some unsatisfying games where everything slows to a crawl, or even a standstill, because one or both players are close to being decked and therefore cannot draw any cards.  All-in-all, it's not a terrible game, but not something I will play very often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Still undecided; needs more play. It's fun, but the games I've played have been very swingy depending on the starting hand. With a good hand, you can play down cards in every phase and start reaping awards ... with a hand of cards all in one phase, you'll either be stuck playing one card a turn or waste a turn (and precious cards) discarding and drawing a new hand.

[u]February 2010:[/u] BattleLine meets Blue Moon. I really like this game, the fact that players don't automatically draw cards at the end of each turn is disturbing but adds a lot of difficulty. I can't say of the decks are balanced yet, it seems to me like the blue deck is harder to win with but I won my fourth and last game with it so... The possibility of deck building with the third deck is a plus.

[u]April 2010:[/u] After 10 games, blue won once... We are having a hard time seeing how both decks are even remotely balanced... I know a lot of people here say they are but I just can't see it... I really don't see myself putting more effort in trying to play the blue deck better, it is just frustrating. As of now, I'll rate this game a 6. If later on I finally understand why blue is so lame in our games and manage to fix that well the rating will go higher but right now this is just frustrating (worse than Mr Jack!). As for deck building, we tried it once, it was fun. From now on, I can definitely see myself playing with symmetric decks (all cards are doubled) but don't know if I'll play the standard game anymore.

On the plus side,  I thought Scarab Lords has a nice quick pace of play, provides some interesting tactical choices, and meshes theme and mechanics (and special card effects) pretty nicely. On the down side, the level of chaos made long-term planning hard, and I didn't think the game would have lots of replay value due to the limited set of cards. I never played with the optional deck construction rules, so I don't know how much they improve the possibilities for strategy or the replay value. I think Blue Moon is a better game, with much better potential for deck construction.

UPDATE: Got this. Played it a couple of times. The technique of acquiring cards vs cursing vs not running out of cards in your own deck is still something I need to spend a few more games getting a strategic feel for. In any case the game plays slower than Blue Moon. Nice technique for maintaining cards in hand.

This game is curiously uncompelling.  Who's going to win?  Who cares?  Part of the problem, I think, is that the decks aren't clearly good vs. evil or merchants vs. warlords or anyone vs. anyone else.  Who are these factions?  What does it mean if one wins?  Is the other enslaved?  Exterminated?  Incredibly embarrassed?  Dull, dull, dull.

Really awesome and cool... looking.  The more I think about it, the more I think that the Religious Supremecy power is just busted.  Maybe if it couldn't curse the other guy's blue cards it would work.  But first one in to the blue puts a lock on it, and then the whole side.  I'd dare anyone to play without that goal at the front of their mind.

RATING: 6
Clever, almost CCG-like, card game.  Players play their own decks and attempt to win influence in two of the three houses in both the upper and lower Nile.  Lots of back and forth, however a clever "phase" mechanic means you have lots of choices of "what to do when?".  The advanced game, allowing deck tweaking, looks very intriguing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good game, needs several plays to get the hang of.  Red seems to be easier for beginners to win with, due to Retribution.  Several rules that people miss: You only win if you have supremacy at the beginning of your turn.  You must play or discard at least one card from your hand every turn.  Actions happen as soon as you play the card.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Underrated CCG-type game. Though 
I've only played three games, I can see a lot of potential. I like the brevity of the games, and how military games runs your opponent out of cards yet a successful commercial game also runs yourself out of cards! Can't wait to try out Blue Moon and see if the good Doctor has added more in that game...

Great game. I like this one better than the sequel, Minotaur Lords, due to the superior quality of the cards, the theme, the artwork, and the more moderate abilities of the cards themselves. This one is very popular at my house. We've only owned it for about a month at the time I am writing this, and we've probably played it 30  times. I would probably have rated it higher except that card games aren't my favorites, and it is rough to play it with a newbie since knowing what cards you have in your deck is vital.

RATING: 8
An excellent two player card game. I enjoy the tit-for-tat struggle for control of the different areas. Timing of card play is essential, and forcing your opponent to discard as his draw deck dwindles down is a great game mechanic. Hand management and pacing your card play are key to victory. I haven&#039;t found the rules to be difficult at all. The FFG web site has some rules clarifications on their message board.

After a couple games, I decided that this game would stay up on my shelf for a long time to come.  You see, too much depends on the luck of the draw for this game to be really successful for me.  And I'm saying that after I WON every game I played.  The reason I didn't like it was because I should have lost that last one.  I made mistakes and I was barely hanging on, then I drew three major cards in a row and BOOM, the game was over.  I hate winning because I got lucky after playing like crap.  To me, that's a sign that the game is broken.

The blue deck in this game seems to be a bit stronger than the red, but overall I think this game is a bit more balanced than Minotaur Lords.  Combining the two games is definitely where the most fun is to be had, but when taken individually, SL seems to be the better game.

It looks like the first Knizia's approach to the field of LCG-ish card games. Two years younger Blue Moon has a very similar flow and gameplay dynamics. The theme here is absolutely superficial and it bothers me a bit. But the game stands on its own and plays well.

A solid card game for two. A must try.

RATING: 6
Since the release of Blue Moon, poor Scarab Lords may get buried in the sands of time, which is a shame.  The two games play quite differently, but for some reason people are quick to compare the two.  Scarab Lords is more of a CCG meets Schotten Totten to me.  The fantastical Egyptianesque setting works well, and I think the artwork is nice.  You can suffer from an intitial bad draw, but the game plays quickly over several hands, and there is room for clever play.

Why play this over the far more interesting and more fluid Blue Moon?  These little two-player "tug of war" games really suck if they tend toward stalemate situations.  And this one does.

RATING: 4
This game is a tug-o-war type of card game. You gain control over different regions and try to get majorities by either your own strength or by manipulating the other player. The main flaw with this seems to be that much is dependent on the initial draw. I think Battle Line, another tug-o-war type of card game for two by Reiner Knizia is a better choice, since it is more elegant and the game play isn‚Äôt as fragile. In this game there seems to be hard to struggle from behind.

Twenty-two plays. A great middleweight card duel with some luck, a lot of tactics, and a little bit of strategy. No, it's not an epic, but the fun, tension and replayability are there. If nothing else, I think it's a step above all the Kosmos two-player games I've tried (except Blue Moon, of course). However, those expecting a CCG will be sorely disappointed. Also: the game really only begins to shine when players become familiar with the decks; if you're only going to play it once, don't bother. Tried the advanced game once and it seemed to work pretty well.

Good game, not played that often. 

Maybe suffers a bit from the "in betweeen chairs" symptom that also affects Blue Moon: 
-it is simple enough, but not as "pure" as Battle Line or Lost Cities (just to mention two other Knizias); 
-it has options and interactions between the cards, but without the depth and possibilities of a big ccg. 

Of course you can consider that it is precisely this that makes this game (along with Blue Moon) a top choice...

Good 2 player.  Seemed a bit unbalanced towards the Red deck after first few plays, but blue is now coming into it&#039;s own.  Blue requires a much more subtle strategy, and can certainly get hurt more by bad draws than Red.  (Though both decks suffer if they don&#039;t get a good starting hand)

I'm not a a MTG fan at all but this pre-packaged card game has that feel.  Use your lords, minions, and building to control 3 regions in either the upper or lower Nile.

Not bad, but I am not a card driven game type of guy, but I want to play it more to see how it works.  After a bunch of games it is growing on me, it does seem fairly balanced.  I love this one, Changed to a 8 on may 12 2010 from a 7.6, a week later changed it to a 9.  What a wonderful game I tell you

Ugh, so I ended up playing this game wrong in three different ways on four different occasions.  Each time something lept out and tore the game down, but now that I think I've finally given the game a correct outing, things are looking up.  Luck of the draw can be overwhelming since given a severly bad hand or a particularly good one for your opponent, you can basically be ousted from victory immediately.  Balance appears much closer than initially judged while gameplay is somewhat chaotic.  All in all, I have some serious issues with the mechanics, but I think it's worth giving a shot (just read the crappy rules enough to understand the vague and unorganized descriptions).  Definitely don't play this game in a bad mood as the luck can drive you insane.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (December 2015)

As Scarab Lords is a Knizias¬¥s design, I wasn‚Äôt expecting much. I have found I dislike most of his newer designs, however Scarab Lords was published on 2002 and I found it is an ok an game, I enjoyed it.

The game components are ok, the game art is very good.

The rules are pretty easy to teach, you can do it under 5 minutes. The decisions are (somewhat) interesting (where to play your cards, which power to activate, where to try to achieve supremacy). There is some luck with the cards, but I feel the luck can be mitigated (for the most part) with clever play, so it doesn‚Äôt bother me much. Also it plays relatively fast. I love that the game offers you some deckbuilding options with other cards and you can mix it with the Minotaur Lords game as well. I have to play this way next time.

Bottom line, I enjoy the game, it has simple rules but non obvious decisions. However my desire to play it again is low. As 2 player games are hard to bring to the table, when the opportunity arises I always want to play other (superior IMO) games (Dungeon Twister, Mage Wars, Summoner Wars, Neuroshima Hex!, Android: Netrunner, Pixel Tactics) but I will keep Scarab Lords and Minotaur Lords in my game collection (at least for now). I want to play them again to see if I should keep them. Perhaps it can get an upgraded rating from me. All things considered, I was pleasantly surprised.

I was pleasantly surprised by this game.  It appears easier to learn and a little more approachable than Blue Moon, though perhaps that would affect the long-term replay value.  The wealth of decks for Blue Moon almost guarantees more variety.  I think it would also help to be familiar with the cards for this game, though one can still enjoy the game without that knowledge.  I think I actually like the pictures better than Blue Moon, which I keep mentioning, though this game also feels very similar to Battle Line/Schotten Totten.

This 2 player game was extremely fun.  The game jumps back and forth a lot and strategies can be destroyed by a single card.  Mixes nicely with minotaur lords though hordes do seem a bit powerful against the scarab cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Scarab Lords comes from a time where, if you wanted to play something with a deck-building feeling, you should look for a CCG. It was flawed, but innovative and unique, which made it worth playing. But, as of now, there are tons of deck building games out there, so this one is becoming obsolete by the second.

Making 2 player games interesting can be difficult. This one is  interesting. The mechanics are relatively good and there elements to make a good game seems to be there: Player asymmetry, additional cards to configure your deck, etc.

It was not an awesome game, but I think there is some potential there to make something good.

RATING: 7.5
Very enjoyable Knizia card game that reminds me of a cross between Blue Moon and Battle Line.  Fortunately I love both of those games so I am also a fan of this as well.  I do find the endgame in which a player in the lead on the board loses by running out of cards in his draw deck a bit unsatisfying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An underrated game, maybe because not always played by the rules, as they are unusual.

One of those few good Knizia games with a theme closely connected to the game play: for instance, a single "Servant of Shadows" can eliminate a minion, but cannot hinder the building of monuments; or the "7 sphinxes" monument takes a long time to build.  Also, when the resources one can draw from are empty (empty deck), it is quite reasonable that the rules declare that one loses.

Some mechanics are refreshing.  For instance, you do not replenish your hand at every turn.  Another important point is that the winning conditions for a player are checked at the beginning of his turn only: this creates situations where the supremacies hint that your opponent is winning (when he dominates both regions), but where you can reverse the tide before he can do anything.  Yet another rule point that might be destabilizing is that you must determine supremacies before exercising them: thus, a domain that you were dominating can switch back to your opponent because of one of his moves; the unusual thing is that you have to wait until the end of your own turn before seeing the switch.

I also like the "story" created by the struggle for supremacy in the Lower and Upper Hekumet: it is nice to review a game that we just played and talk about "the time when you dominated Upper Hekumet, before I succeeded in taking back religious power"...  Tension is fueled by the Supremacy phase, where who is winning it is made obvious--yet one can hope to use one's turn to change the situation.

The ebb and flow of who is dominating in each sphere (religious, etc.) fills the game with strategy, as you must take into account the current supremacies in order to plan ahead.

The game is also very tactical, since what you can do depends on your cards, and these are quite varied in powers.  The card powers can also be combined, as in a Collectible Card Games.

There are no victory points in this game; I appreciate the "soft" reasoning that can be used for winning: not much calculation is involved in studying what cards are discarded by your opponent, or in noticing that he does not seem to care for Military power, for instance.  This is a nice change from more "computational", good Knizia games such as Samurai, Through the Desert, Schotten-Totten, etc.

The special card powers and the deck building of the advanced rules is a nice way of dipping a toe in the world of Collectible Card Games, I guess--even though this game is not collectible.

The English (and French) rules could be a little bit more friendly (for instance by describing what a typical turn looks like: with no "0" phase).  However, it is easy to get into the game after one play.

It is important to emphasize the fact that destroying all the potential of your opponent is a valid way of winning (in addition to the other one, which is to dominate both Hekumet regions).  Thus, a player can win by forcing his opponent to be left with no resources (i.e. cards) through the use of Military supremacies.

For those who are interested in this game, it is definitely interesting to check Blue Moon and Minotaur Lords as well, and to try all of these games.  Blue Moon is, to my opinion, quite different from Scarab Lords: Blue Moon is a series of fights where you can spend 2/3 of the game and still be even with your opponent (dragons in the middle), whereas Scarab Lords is an area control game, with a confrontation over 6 areas (2 regions, 3 powers) which bring you special powers, and where the areas controlled by each player generally slowly shift (hence a greater sense of achievement for the player who succeeded in conquering powers).

Just make sure that you really play exactly by the rules, as their unusual mechanics makes them easy to overlook.

I love it!

Note: How often can you win through dominating in both regions?  Very often, the fate of our games is dominated by fights for military supremacy.  Maybe can seasoned players quickly share both military supremacies, and then fight over other domains (religious and economic).

I have the Swedish rules for this and they are seriously clumsy. Took a while to figure them out. Only played it a few times so far, seems like a game with a lot of potential, but we need to basically learn what the different cards can do and which are available to each player. Will definitely be playing this again. Not good for non-gamers, IMO.

I think this game is just plain broken.  Yup, I said it.  Love my Knizia, don't get me wrong.  Won't ever part with my copy of T&E, love my Loot, think Ra rocks, etc.  But this game just doesn't even get off the ground before it's over.  Neither player can develop a winning strategy, neither the looser nor the winner, it just happens suddenly.

Put me in the category of folks that thinks this is not one of Knizia's best efforts.  I much prefer Battleline or Pecking Order.  Perhaps I am misunderstanding some rule or strategy, but it seems like the game is over in 2-3 turns.  I have only tried the basic game, but I don't see that stacking the deck with a few new cards is going to make that much difference.  My rating is this high only because I may not yet have given the game enough play or else I just haven't gotten around to revising it downwards.

The rules could use some clarifying, but you can figure it out after one game.  Really enjoyed this one.

Elegant and clever two-player area dominance card game with fast play times. Mid-level player interaction. Rules and game play tending toward the analytic and min-maxing over spontaneous or reactionary. Randomness from deck shuffling built in to mitigate the mathematical nature of the game. Session times between ten to 30 minutes, averaging around 15 to 20. Similar to but more varied and complex with more replayability in the long run than Lost Cities.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A two player game by Knizia that feels like a two player game by Knizia.  Players each have a deck of cards (that can be specialized by adding cards from a third deck) and use them to gain dominance in each of six columns on the board.  When players have dominance in a column they get special abilities.

The two decks seem decently balanced (they have very different strategies), and the game plays quickly once the (not-too-complicated) rules are finished.  There is a bit of fiddly-ness, though, as there are four types of cards, and each card can modify the other cards (but often only modifies cards of one of the four types).  

One very interesting mechanic is that players' hands are not automatically refreshed; instead, players must skip a full turn to refresh their hand.  This makes the game very cruel ... both of my first games ended when the opposing player had no cards left that could counter the opponents move (but could have had some if they'd been able to draw).

Overall this seems like a good two player that I'd be willing to play again.  I'm not sure the customization is really that great, though, as it'd add a lot of time and requires experience with the game to be useful (I'd rather just have another few full decks).

Noncollectible card game from Knizia. Play cards to dominate in religon, military or economics, earning advantages while you do so. Win by dominating in two areas of the board.
I'll play this game if asked. It's all right, but it seems by turn 2 or 3, one will know the outcome. Either a quick decisive victory or a slow painful death as one's opponents discards your cards as you squirm. Interesting card play mechanism, but Magic did come out 10 years earlier. Rating may go up, since all 5 of my games have been with the blue deck, might be interesting to try the red deck.

This game looks great and the story and feel of the game is excellent, but unfortunately that is where the good parts end, because the game is sadly made quite dull, by the sheer fact that the winner is the one who first gets the cards to enable control of the religious sectors. Once thats done the opponent hasn't got a chance since his cards will be flooded with scarabs and unusable, and that would be fine if there were some real struggle to get the areas, but it is the luck of random cards that determine that. Add to that the unfortunate fact that with the right draw the red deck can actually win the game in the first turn before the blue player gets to play a single card. That should not be possible in any game, and while that scenario isn't likely, I did manage to win in turn 2 after blue had only played 1 card, because I got lucky on the draw. So even though it looks and feel great, it doesn't work at all. By far not one of Reiner Knizias best games.

RATING: 6
I was pleasantly surprised by this one. The rules are a little overwrought, but once assimilated, the game plays smoothly. There is a neat strategy element of determining which of the 3 piles (in each of 2 regions) you want to be winning (play highest valued cards against) to gain it's special action each turn - which are to play to a red pile to force your opponent to get through their deck faster (and lose if they run out), play to the green pile to allow you to draw cards and go for the quicker win (ie winning 4 or the 6 piles), or go for the blue pile to take an opponent's card out of action. There are also nice options each turn based on what cards you've got, and whether to play cards at all or go for special actions. It just doesn't seem to get played all that much because it falls into a middle hole - too gamery for non-gamers, too many other better 2 players for gamers. Our more recent games have been overwhelmed by the fight for religious power however. If you can secure that, you can secure the region. Which is making the game more one-dimensional than originally thought.

I'm on the fence with Scarab.  I love the theme, artwork, and mechanics of cardplay.  The faux egyptology, simplicity and portability are great.  But the game seems to be broken (an shocking thing to say about a Knizia game).

Play tends to reach a stuck state (sometimes early in the game).  One player will be incapable of improving his position, or even taking any useful action. The stuck player will simply watch, turn after turn, as his opponent plays cards and walks off with a win. 

Maybe I am missing something?  Mail me if you have a tip.

(10+ plays) Now that I've played this game a few times, I probably won't change my rating.  I enjoy it for what it is.  Basically, the victory conditions are easy to establish on a given turn, but the opponent gets one turn to foil you.  The game goes back and forth, each player often establishing the win condition until one player happens to not have the card mix to foil the other, or one player runs out of cards.  Plays like a CCG in that the red or blue deck will "go off" or not based on card draw.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A decent card game.  Where you choose to play cards may give you special powers and affect your future options, which makes this feel like a board game.  But the multiple constraints on which cards can be played when/where combines poorly with the fear of drawing too many cards and running out your deck.  You have either too few choices or a high chance of a resolution unsatisfying to both sides.

RATING: 5
Although each player's deck has the same quantity of type, the values and allowed placements differ. So, competitively speaking, there is already a cloudiness to relating to your opponent's hand and making informed decisions: first play is then meaningless and my family, friends and I are not really the types that like to explore and experience the way each deck works,though for some this will give the game high replay value. Another reason that Scarab Lords won't be played is the long winded player turn (although numbering the phase that a card can be played improves pace) and the long winded stage of determining supremacy. Has the CCG feel (without the brutal mechanic and marketing of that genre) so understand SL is for that market, but has no place here I'm afraid. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Scarab Lords is an unusual game. At it's core, this is Battle line (Schotten Totten) raised several notches combined with Blue Moon. Players are contending for several areas simultaneously but play with a deck no larger than that for Blue Moon. This results in a game that is much more complex than Blue Moon and yet mirrors it in many aspects. Of the two games Blue Moon has greater variety with all of the expansions but Scarab Lords has greater depth; it is far more challenging. The situation mirrors that of Ticket to Ride and Age of Steam - both are good games and are the appropriate game for a given time and group. 

Update: Scarab Lords is simply a much better game than Blue Moon. After many, many games of Blue Moon there is just nothing new, no challenge. This has never happened with the Lords games.

RATING: 5
Just doesn't live up  to its potential, rated a weak 5. The card decks are too limited which  minimizes replay value; the game needs larger decks from which a fraction are drawn randomly.  Only about 1 in 3 games played so far have had interesting card play/decisions, the other 2/3 are one-sided blowouts. Can be fun but still largely driven by the luck of the draw.

Like it's counterpart, Minataur Lords, this is still a clever game.  But there are even more duplicated cards in Scarab Lords, many of which are shared by both sides.  Also, I don't like that there are so few zero phase cards in Scarab Lords, it really limits the number of cards/actions you have on your turn.  The addition of supremacy phase cards is a plus, though.  The art is still "meh", and I could see the play getting dull after a while (given the limited customization and card-types).  I have yet to test the two games together.

I really like this little game.  The mechanics are fun and clean.  Being able to build your decks is wonderful.  More fun when one player gets Scarab Lords and the other gets  Minotaur Lords.  That way each player can really build their own deck and makes the game more playable and fun.  Still fun to play with my wife.  Always played with Minotaur Lords.

Oh wait, I already have Battleline.  Sheesh.  This game just doesn't work that well for me.  I'm not often a fan of games with cards that have a lot of stuff on them, I find that those kinds of games suffer from bad draws.  In this case a hand full of "ones" really kills the fun.  I can see how this might appeal to some people, eg folks that gave away their Magic cards to save their family.  I'm just not one of them.  I'll take the elegence of Battleline anyday over this constipated cousin.

Played my first three games today using the basic rules.  Seems like SL is a fun, light card game without a great deal of depth in the basic variant.  Will revisit my rating once I play the advanced version which only really adds the ability to make changes to the deck before the start of play.  The game components are minimal, a small board, three decks of nice looking cards and a few counters essentially.  The rules were lacking in a few areas and I had to resort to BGG for clarification, and surprisingly there was even confusion on some of the forums about some of the rules, so that is a disappointment, they could have been a lot clearer on a couple of key points. At the moment I recommend getting this game if you can get it at a bargain price, I paid NZ$20 which is about US$12.  I wouldn't want to pay anymore.  It seems like a nice addition to my collection for the odd game of something a little different. Time will tell.

I've enjoyed this game but it is quirky.  For some reason it's not very approachable.  The cards are difficult to read and uninspiring to look at.  The rules are not intuitive.  It's one of those games that's kind of clunky, where you need plenty of rule clarifications.  I like the CCG type of games mor than most, so my rating is biased towards the high end.

I won this in a recent Math Trade (my first successful one) where my actual goal was the sweetener (Odin‚Äôs Ravens!). I didn‚Äôt have much hope of getting it to the table since my husband seems to have been tiring a bit of card-driven games recently but when he asked me what new games I wanted to get to the table he selected this one and has been requesting it just about every night we have had the time. The game has more depth than I think either of us were expected and I recently ordered some stone scarabs so I can pimp my copy :)

Scarab Lords appears to be Knizia's take on Magic. In the box comes 2 prebuilt decks and another 30 card deck for players to mix and build their own decks.

I've not gotten as far as deck building yet (and that part doesn't really interest me) but playing just with the decks that are prebuilt this is a close, interesting little card game. The ability to burn through your cards quickly reduces the luck of the draw.

What a clever little design. Simplicity itself.

Magic the Gathering done Knizia/Euro-style. A challenging asymmetrical two-player card game that takes some basic CCG concepts and welds them into a unique, tighter game. After a couple of plays, I'm still enjoying this and looking forward to refining my approach once I'm more familiar with the cards on both sides. I rather suspect that the game is prone to some routs if one player receives a bad inital hand, and the fact that the most consistent way to defeat your opponent is to "deck" them (force them to run out of cards) takes some getting used to. Otherwise, balance is good, options for players are available if not plentiful, and each decision is crucial, given limited cards and actions, making for a very tense but enjoyable experience.

Even without having used the third deck, or using the deck-building rules, I can see this having a CCG-like flavor.  There aren't any tremendous card combinations by themselves, but there are some neat combos using the Phase 1 and Phase 2 cards together.  The supremacy rules add a little something extra to the game, and I can see also how this game was the precursor to Blue Moon.  I'd like to play it again.

Some games get old too fast and this is the oldest of them all - together with it's younger twin brother, Minotaur Lords.

Cardgame. Not CCG. Can be combined with Minotaur Lords.

Once I grasped what was going on with this, I liked it quite a bit. Almost every decision is tense (without a clearcut "best" path), and it still plays very quickly for a game that's as much of a brain burner as this is. I can see why it's got a relatively low ranking; there are some bad points here. Anybody who thinks Race for the Galaxy is too cryptic should stay away here. The phases are confusing, and the cards are not always completely clear in their meaning for first-timers. I also think that hand management might play too large of a role compared to strategic card play, but I may change my feeling about that with further plays. It does seem like it's worth getting over the hump for, though.

Bien, me sorprendi√≥, no he vuelto a jugarlo en mucho tiempo, pero no fue mala experiencia.

Adem√°s fue un regalo por comprar otro juego, pero luego hasta el tema me result√≥ atractivo.

Fun little card game. I love the artwork, and the theme, unlike some Knizia games, doesn't feel pasted on.

Received in trade for Battle for Hill 218.

Challenging hand management game.  Wife and I enjoy playing.  Some take-that action can lead to hurt feelings around here though.

Prefer to play Blue Moon.

A decent two player card game.  Nothing particularly special, but generally fun.

It takes a couple of games to find what the decks primarily focuses on.. a good game which the main decision is to decide which card to play in which column that will provide a free bonus during the supremacy phase. Have yet to test the advance deck as yet as some cards in there seems over powered. Fans of ccg should love this!

Scarab Lords and Minotaur Lords are two wonderfully synthetic games. Rules are not immediate but anyways are easy (but the first 4 games i played with one fundamental rule wrong and I couldnt understand the game finale) so read carefully!
It is fast enough and it begs for another chance immediately. You have more than one strategy to follow, you can mix decks to enanche ad libitum the longevity and it allows you to use a lot of fantasy. A great game with two titles. ML is a tad better because the two decks are very very different while in SL the decks are pretty similar.

I prefer Blue Moon because it is more streamlined and elegant, but I have had some fun with Scarab Lords, especially enjoying the card-selecting/deck-building parts.

Very cool filler. It has its quote of strategy and luck and I like it much more than Blue Moon.

Good game. A little like Battleline except it adds curses (which keeps you from adding points for cards) and the cards you play may have powers.

RATING: 6
Enjoyed my one and only play of this. Looks like it would be interesting to learn how best to play with each deck. The "deck-building" was interesting, but would end up being a bit limited with only 2 of the 3 hands including any. Also not sure how much "counter-metagaming" there is within the neutral deck. Rating could go up with more plays.

I feel like the theme represents 'ancient Egypt' very well...but...

Played a few times. A nice quick game for 2 players. As can be expected in a card game, the luck of the draw will play a role, but the game is short and remains interesting enough. Both decks are not symmetric - however I haven't played enough to judge of their balance.

After one play: Nice two player battle card game. Need more plays to be sure, but it seems up there with Blue Moon, Jambo, etc.

Rules are pretty badly written and confusing, though.

Played basic version only. Not great, but still not as good as it's cousins, Battle Line and Lost Cities.

I really like the difficult decision making in this, but the odd balance of the 'sides' (a successful strategy for the blue side was lost to both of us) and making your opponent lose by draining their deck seemed unsatisfying.

Poorly written rules and a thin deck dooms this game.  Too complicated to be a light filler and too limited to be a rich CGG alternative.

I think this game is great fun and very interesting. There are definately different possible strategies to explore, and the addition of a deck construction element increases this.

Juego muy bueno, que no est√° nada valorado en la BGG, para 2 jugadores. Una especie de Battleline con tintes de Magic que tiene m√°s miga de la que parece. Lo jugu√© much√≠simo y acab√© cambi√°ndolo para poder jugar a otra cosa.

Mesmerising design, and one of Pharaoh Knizia's best.

In my opinion, a very bad game. The best things of this game are its size and its design...
One of the Knizia¬¥s ugly sons (todo buen escribano echa un borr√≥n... o dos).

RATING: 7
Takes a while to work out how not to finish this game on the 3rd turn. Found that you need to work on taking supremacy from your opponent rather than trying to gain it in areas he doesnt have it. Cursing is a particularly good tactic.

RATING: 7
Really decent 2-player card game from Knizia that makes you think and work to win.  A bit more complicated than something as, say, Lost Cities (so its replayability will suffer somewhat) but an intriguing game nonetheless.

I wasn't impressed and affectionately refer to this game as Scrap Lords.  I'd rather play some other two player game if given the choice.

After 1 Play: On first blush I like this one better than Blue Moon. I'm sure I'll play it again though, and I have no idea if it will stay interesting over time.

After 5+ Plays: I got pretty tired of this game after a few more plays.  There's not enough variety to the play, and too much advantage is given to whoever keeps there god cards in play the longest.

Bought this to play with my girlfriend because she likes Egyptian themes. Let's see how that goes.

RATING: 5
Quirky area control card game with special powers and the feel of a (limited) CCG. The card quality and artwork are excellent, the mechanics decent (not amazing), the playtime just right. The consensus seems to be that Blue Moon is an improvement on this idea, and I happen to agree. The one point this gets over Blue Moon is that it's easier to teach to non-gamers.

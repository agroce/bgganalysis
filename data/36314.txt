Second copy NIS. Will possibly TRADE... A great production from MMP. Lots of map area(s) and counters. Chit Pull wargaming at its finest. GTS rules have evolved a bit and improved. Long game sessions but satisfying nonetheless.

11/15/15: With all the sheets of counters why isn't there a counter to indicate that troops are in piggyback mode?  Seems to be an oversight and causes a lot of problems when you're trying to figure out which troops have dismounted and which haven't.  Especially when you have multiple players swapping in and out.  

* House rule: With the reinforcement event, if you bring units in from off board, you need to put them with the leader.  (The rulebook doesn't state where the counter may be placed.)

7/4/15: Started the campaign game on 6/28/15.  Looking foward to it.  Compared to WED, the plus is that the exclusive rules are indexed, the negative is that the activation chits are the same size as the other counters, difficult to read, and is really very annoying.  In The Devil's Cauldron they were 1" chits.  Hoping that they correct this in The Greatest Day.

1/22/12: Sister game to The Devil's Cauldron.  This cover's XXX Corps' advance.  The two games can be combined to a game that will take the whole room for the totally ridiculous monster game.  One of those game maps that can be measured in yardage. 138"x54"

I've been going through the rules again, bearing down to give this series another thorough chance - I like  a lot of things about it, but was frustrated by dumb scenarios in TDC. My god, what a total disaster. I'll give you TDC, it was your first big game, you were inexperienced and didn't know any better, so you used a rulebook style that was, in retrospect, a really, really bad idea. You had an idea about a new and different approach to writing these rules that I'm sure sounded persuasive at the time, and it's hard to be too hard on you for trying something new. At the end of the day, though, it didn't work. No; it did more than just not work, it failed rather spectacularly. Now, after 3 years, it takes a certain degree of persistence to keep that dysfunctional style the second time out (and third too probably, I can't imagine it'll change before No Question of Surrender). I thought, having learned the system once, coming up to speed again wouldn't be insanely frustrating. I was wrong.

The rules say you have a choice between this basically worthless chatty rulebook and a "concise" rulebook. You do not. There is no concise rulebook. There is a "Rules Summary" booklet. That summary does not summarize the rules, if you think a summary should be comprehensive. The booklet is a reminder of many important rules. It does not cover all the rules, including many critical ones. It does not cover, for example, the fact that units in a barrage hex have their range reduced to one. This is fairly important. It also does not cover that your range is reduced to one if an enemy is adjacent, also somewhat crucial.

This is almost unbearably frustrating, as you may be able to tell by the fact that I am even bothering to write this rant, again. Nobody I know has found this rulebook to be anything other than crazy-bad. I've been playing wargames for 30 years, I play ASL, I play OCS, I play GACAW, I play Republic of Rome, I've struggled through appalling GMT rulebooks like PQ-17. I have played plenty of games where individual rules were imprecise, but you understood the design intent and so were able to figure them out. Rarely have I been so frustrated by a ruleset as I have been with WED and TDC, which not only fails to clearly explain its rules, it also conveys so little understanding of the game system that it's hard to even guess the intent. I really wish it had been fixed.
---
First impressions - and we're talking *really* first impressions, basically just breaking it out of the box - are somewhat underwhelming. My biggest hope, that the horrible series rulebook would be revisited and improved at least somewhat, has not been realized. Either the core rules and many of the exclusive rules haven't been changed at all, or there is nowhere in the new game summarizing the changes.

I pre-ordered WED largely because I hoped a) the system would be revised and tweaked a bit to make it just a touch more playable; b) The series rulebook would be made more comprehensible; c) there would be decent non-monster scenarios; and d) primarily, because even if it wasn't a terrific game, TDC turned out to be a good financial investment and so there didn't seem to be a lot of risk. a)-c) are looking dicey. The fact that the rulebook appears to be basically the same unusable mess it was in TDC is rather disappointing. Hopefully if nothing else d) will work out.

Did not get grabbed by it. 

After trying SCS and now GTS, I learned that I dislike the grand tactical scale. ThereÂ´s something a tiny bit ridiculous when you fire one company and the other one gets eliminated, and I see no added benefit in increasing the density vs. an operational game. Not my cup of tea..

On the game now:

+ I like the rulebook but it is a horrible reference, it should have been accompanied by a real rulebook
+ I love the chit pulling system and command/dispatch points mechanism

- I find the counter art unappealing and the counters unclear
- The map looks good, but I dislike the way the hexes are printed, this makes distances tougher to grasp
- The assault procedure is super fiddly and in general boring to repeat
- There is too much binary luck involved in the Company bonus modifier, this is inelegant
- The box is huge and it shouldn't have been so, GMT has got this right
- It is a space hog

I am sure there are people who swear by the system, but I really do not find it fun. To each his own.

I am an addicted fan of Devil's Cauldron.  Where Eagles Dare has been developed with the experience of years of dedicated play of DC so I expect it will be as good if not better.  I turned a 6 x 8 meter shed into a permanent and comfortable games room many years ago now and despite the size the two games combined will fit comfortably.  Bring it on!

RATING: 9
Combined with companion game THE DEVIL'S CAULDRON, this is the most engrossing OPERATION MARKET-GARDEN experience.  As a stand alone game, it's still quite excellent and--save for the Assaults--moves along briskly.  Tension is generally high when the Germans lunge against the Allies to deny them free and open use of Club Route north to bring succor to 82nd Airborne Division at Nijmegen and the beleaguered 1st Airborne Division at Arnhem.

MMP has a great sequel to "Devil's Cauldron".  As I mentioned in my 'puts to that game, this game system lends itself to this type of battle/campaign, much more than an ASL-type treatment could certainly do.  The historical research is impressive (I was a battlefield Tour Guide while stationed in Germany and spent over a decade wandering this part of Holland).  The only issue I have have, and it's more with the system than this game is indirect fires.  It's based on individual unit, thus according to my read if there's more than unit in a hex they don't undergo fire combat (other than any "barrage" marker).  This is 180 outta reality-the more potential targets indirect fires become exponentially more effective.  A house rule that allows each unit to undergo fire combat is a good way to simulate this reality.
I hope that MMP would use this system/analysis with Ardennes Offensive battles.  Bastogne (go figure), St Vith, Elsenborn Ridge and KG Peiper would all be appropriate to game at the Company/Battalion level.

As a slightly less popular companion to "the Devil's Cauldron," this game is a great deal of fun as players begin Operation Market-Garden moving 30 Corps to meet the Yank Para's enroute to the British Para's. The designers excellent taste in counter and map art shine here as well and culminate in a treasure of a game. A very popular "Beer & Pretzel" game that is full of maneuver and edge of your seat excitement. The games "chit pull" system keeps players guessing who will be next to take their turn. A game I highly recommend both as an educational tool and to play just for the joy of it.

Nice wargame, always great to play, one single flaw in the game - namely the map and scenario design which calls for enormous amounts of table space for even some of the smaller scenarios. Could possibly have benefited from a better map layout / better scenario design.

WED is not as compelling as TDC. Problems: XXX Corp is really restricted from using any screening units to keep the Germans off the road (British lose points for the Allies when units off the road), no way to indicate that troops are in piggyback mode (would have been nice to have some counters for this), the chit pull counters are tiny unlike TDC, events feel way out of balance ... too many routs or sudden rallies etc., really hard to read German font on counters (my eyes are getting old and hard to focus), 88s are very powerful (maybe too much so), for multiple Germans player there is just not as much to do -- only the 59th gets any real action.

I really loved TDC as there are much more options and maneuvering possibilities. WED is more restrictive and limited.

However, this plus Devil's Cauldron is an Epic 10.

Played full campaign until the 19th November, 13:00. Great game.

Un dÃ©but de campagne menÃ© jusqu'au 19 jour Ã  13 heures.
La situation de dÃ©part est trÃ¨s difficile pour les AlliÃ©s qui ont peu d'unitÃ©s du groupe Hot pour faire la brÃ¨che.

Le jeu est une petite merveille, le systÃ¨me d'Ã©vÃ©nements mÃ©riterait cependant d'Ãªtre affinÃ©, j'ai trouvÃ© que le chaos gÃ©nÃ©rÃ© par ces Ã©vÃ©nements Ã©tait parfois de nature Ã  renverser la vapeur de faÃ§on trop radicale.

Another game in the GTS series focusing on the 101st Airborne's operations during Operation Market Garden.  Fantastic components and good system that takes awhile to get used to, but it works.  My only complaint is that either the scenarios are too small or they're too big!  To really get into the system you need to try one of the larger scenarios, which could be a problem for some gamers because of the space and time commitments.

The first thing that grabbed me about this game was the opening scenario, which features British troops on a recon mission stopping for a cup of tea well behind enemy lines! The nature of the chit-pull system, coupled with the order in which they are pulled can add a degree of uncertainty to the game. Actually built a bigger game table so I could play the campaign game. Some excellent smaller scenarios, but not enough of them. One very good feature - counters are now located in the countersheets by scenario. Which makes finding them very easy!

Solid sequel to Devil's Cauldron.  Of the two I rate this one slightly lower.  Not too sure but I expected just a little more grab from this one.  Still a fine game system on its own and components are fully compatible with Devil's Cauldron.  Center map actions when both games are combined involve units from both games adding to the link-up pressure for the Allies but good luck storing this beast once it is set up.

Personally, I like the rulebooks and think that Jon Gautier did a good job on them.  Would have liked to see backprinted maps so that some of the scenarios would fit on a single map.

RATING: 5
Not sure this one is worth the time, space, and effort to set up.  There is a TON of map space that you will never use (prob about 1.5 maps worth of space start with no units set up on it and present less than ZERO percent chance of ever moving a unit there) except to possibly watch German units enter from a map edge and drive / walk to where the fight is.

Watching the Guards Armored Div move up a road they essentially can't leave while German units try and pick them off or just drop some artillery on the road my accurately portray what happened, but makes for a boring and at times, frustrating game play experience (just wait unit your dice go bad and you can't kill one meaningless German unit camped out on the road).

There also seems more than plenty of times where a bad chit run can literally end the game far before you'd wish it would (i.e lots of effort for an early end to the game).

To the positive - components are amazing.  System and rules are also very tight and worth using for future modules.

I bought this in one of MMP's fall sales.  On reading through the rules though, I set it aside, as it simply seemed too complicated.  But then after a couple of years I saw Ty Snouffer's videos and I was amazed at how much easier the rules really were.  So I got back into the game and discovered a great rules set.  I just hate how the rules are put together.

The rules are actually easy to digest once you have looked at Ty's videos, and comprehend their logic.  And the line of sight rules are easily the best I've seent, concise and very simple.  I even find this system very easy to get back into after a while away from it.

If you have any interest in any of the games in this series, you have to look at Ty's tutorial videos.  They are GREAT!  His videos are easily the most useful videos I have ever seen on wargaming.

This particular game in the series is bad though for it's scenario selection.  There are a grand total of five scenarios, only one of which is actually is manageable.  Two of the scenarios are tiny ones for you to learn the mechanics of the game, with just a few units used.  Two of scenarios are huge, one using four of the five maps, the other all five.  So unless you have a table five feet wide and twelve feet long you can't play those two scenarios.

The one scenario which is manageable requires the use of parts of three different maps.  Just parts of them, so the actual size is about a single map.  Despite the high price of the game they couldn't be bothered to back print one of the maps to accommodate this.

The designer did say shortly after this game came out that he would provide some additional scenarios.  But since then when asked about this, he simply asks what scenario they would like him to make, as if they are more knowledgeable about the subject than he is after he did all the research on the subject.  This game would get a 9 from me if it had a decent selection of scenarios.

I do love the system, and plan on buying the British beaches, Crete, Tinian, and probably most of the new games in the series that come out.  But I recommend you stay away from this particular title because the selection of scenarios is a joke.

My favorite game right now (June 2014) and has been for about a year. The system is tight and enjoyable to play. Robust but not overly complex and provides for a lot of strategy.

Hell's Highway is a great setting to with some really interesting battles to playthrough. Scenarios 3-5 (the campaign) are really a thrill to play. The earlier scenarios are good too but more for entry into the syste,

What sends this over the top for me is how much Hell's Highway comes to life for me. More than for any other game I've played, Where Eagles Dare is at a scale that allows the history to shine through. Valkenswaard, Eindhoven, Son, Best, Veghel . . . these actions are all well-represented and I feel like I really know what is going on. Not merely playing a game on a map. 

Kudos!

Lack of scenarios playable in a reasonable space makes this game far less attractive han TDC. The scenario list in the game description is misleading; apart from a couple of tiny teaching scenarios and one three-mapper, you'll need to find a 9'x 5' table to play any of the advanced scenarios. Additional scenarios have been promised but not delivered.

On a more positive note, the maps are lovely, errata seems minimal, and the system itself is excellent.

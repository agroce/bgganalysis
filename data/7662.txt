GAME: Bar-Lev: The Yom-Kippur War of 1973
RANK: 4764
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of the first wargames I played growing up, still greatly enjoy this one. A bit asymmetrical and I still have yet to see the Syrians win but I love it all the same. A true uphill climb for the Arab players but always a slow for the Israelis and tons of fun.

Originally owned the GDW edition, played back in the day. Recently (Dec 2010) picked up a copy of the original. Looking forward to giving it some table time! Rating currently based on the GDW game.

Got the original back in the early 70's.  Played this game a lot with my friends in the Strategy and Tactics Club in high school (a year later our school got "enlightened" and made us change our name to the Games Club and made us play other games besides just military history simulations-yes,political correctness existed even back then).  
     We had a lot of fun playing this game.  I especially loved being the Isrealis and wiping out Arab units with my artillery.  Air war option to game was a must to play along with the ground war.

RATING: 9
I played the original version, I recently acquired the later version on E-Bay since I enjoyed it so much.  

I think the reason i like the game so much is because it is tactically interesting for both players and strategically interesting for the Israeli's. Both sides get to attack, the Arabs come out strong and it does look they will roll the Israeli's over, but the Israeli's do get to counterattack.  The game is often very tense.

One outstanding feature is the integration of the air war and the ground war; the Arab Sam's and air force are very tough.  The Israeli's have to decide to try to punch through early, to help their beleaguered ground troops, or try for air superiority.  The israeli's also have to decide which front to emphasize.

However, this is a 'wargamer's wargame, it isn't for casual players.  In addition, the compoennts are not spectacular.  The rules are realtively clear.

I have 2 first printing copies, one punched and one unpunched. This is one game that I will get out of bed to play. Just ask my friends.

RATING: 8
Really interesting game of the Yom Kippur War.  The flow is good and the mechanics of both the land and air modules are great.  The game does a nice job of simulating the beating the IAF took during the first days of the war from the Arab SAMs.  I found the CRT to be interesting in that there is no retreat result, something I had never seen before on a wargame.  Over all this is a really good game and it was well worth the effort of trying to track down a copy.  Note: this is all based on the 1974 Conflict version.

The 8 is for the 1974 version, the later version was nowhere near as much fun to play. The early version is probably the most played game I've ever owned of this type.

RATING: 8
Own & have played the GDW version (last time in my uni days and gave it a 5/5 then).  My tastes have "evolved" since, and arguably better games of the 1973 Yom Kippur War have emerged (eg. Crisis Sinai (GMT) & Yom Kippur (Gamers)), but would still give it an 8 on the Geek scale for enjoyment at low complexity AND the ability to fight, and juggle forces between, both the Suez & Golan fronts.

RATING: 8.5
The first edition version, the one with the orange hexes, is simply a blast to play, fast and tense and with surprisingly simple rules. The game is played on one sheet divided into two maps, the Sinai Front map and the Golan Front map, with the Golan set at a different scale. Reinforcements flow through various off-board boxes to each front. It can be played as a 2, 3 or 4 player game. The air sub-routine is a mini- game in itself. After playing this game once you'll insist on playing it again and again.

876- game is well regarded & includes the Air Module rules and the rule changes w/ errata. BRIGHT orange map! The map is split (suez canal area & Golen Heights) and has DIFFERENT scales for each sector. It's also unusual that the suggested # of players is....3!

Another great John Hill design: tense, lots of carnage, easy rules.

This was (and remains) a helluva good wargame. It's fast-paced and gives players a lot of choices, especially the Israeli.  Even today after 40 years I trot it out once in a while which is a lot more than I can say for most of the stuff stashed away in Rubbermaid tubs in my basement.  The game components were amateurish but the whole thing worked and was very topical at the time of its release shortly after the actual conflict. Unlike the 1967 Six Day War I don't think that there has been a credible simulation of the 1973 conflict since Bar-Lev came out.

Update - 2017.  October War is here and I have it but haven't played it yet.  Somehow I'm not sure that it will be terribly better than Bar-Lev mainly because it's point to point (the lazy developers way)

If the map hadn't gone all the way to Cairo and instead gave more ground coverage to the east in the Sinai it would have been even better.Still one of the classic games from the 70's

I'm sure better historical sims have came out since the Conflict Game- but this one captured the essence of the war, and is a great GAME. (No comment on the map colors...hmmm?)

Had to reedit the colors on the most orange map I've ever seen.  Now it is a yellow to be more deserty.  Really excellent 3 player game and gives a feel of the 73 war even though it uses some gamey mechanisms.

RATING: 7.5
Only played the second edition. An excellent tactical game. Seems a little imbalanced, and after the Egyptians get the canal there is not a lot to go do. The Syrian front was smokin! Also makes a good 3 or 4 player game with 2 arabs and 1 israeli, or two israelis.

Excellent 2-4 player game of both front in this war. It has an ugly but unique map that allows the Israeli player to move units from front-to-front.

A John Hill design.  I own both versions of the game and the original Conflict version (day-glo orange map and all) is a much better game than the GDW version.  Another great game by John Hill.
Played pre-BGG.

Nice complete treatment of the yom kippur war. Despite it'Ã¬s age and it's "primitive" graphics it is a good game with plenty of action on both sides. It is one of the few games that cover both fornts and integrates air and land war ina single package. all the chrome from the fourth AIW is here: SAM umbrella, israeli tank repair and canal crossing.

Childhood favorite.  Played multipl times with friends in High School.  I'e been to the Golan Heights, and the map looks NOTHING like how John Hill drew it, but it is still a blast to play.  Air war is a fun game all on its own

I had some great fun with this one despite a really ugly map. Seriously unbalanced in my view, the Israelites will blast their way through any defender with that powerful artillery every time I think.
The divided map with strategic communication between them was a nice touch somewhat reminding me of Serbia/Galicia.

The Picture provided on this game is the Conflict Games version - the GDW version came in a ziplock bag with another illustration (I don't recall now what it was). The game I want is the GDW ziplock version. The GDW game also came in a blue/black flatbox with drawing of Moshe Dayan and Israeli tank and flag.

John Hill did well here.  He used a "split screen" approach having separate fronts on different sections of the game map: Suez Front and Syrian Front.  The air module is almost a complete game in itself.  This game has everything from helicopter raids to fortified kibbutzim.  A true three-player game that pits Egyptians and Syrians against the Israeli.  An exciting game!

A good playing operational level game. Both the Sinai and Golan fronts are displayed in detail. The Air war is included and displayed as important. Enjoyed how it melded the air war into the game.
Enjoyed the problem of allocating Israeli resources between the fronts. 
The map is the ugliest (bright ORANGE) I've ever seen.

World's ugliest game board. OK simulation.

Got to play this once, some time ago (not that long, compared to the age of the game). In some ways fairly standard, in others very nicely done. Add to that the fact that the two-front war is a sure source of tension, and this is a vastly underappreciated game.

One of my all-time favorite games. To me it seemed like there was just the right balance between playability and complexity. Not much to look at; the map could promote an epileptic fit. The components weren't great, but pretty good for the time - about PanzerBlitz quality. Interesting features like the split map for the Suez and Syrian fronts - had to remember that they were different scales. Interesting air war rules, lots of 'what-ifs'. Easy to play solitaire, and you could have up to four players. Very well balanced, every player had a chance to win. Just writing about it makes me want to go pull it out again.

Groundbreaking and timely design that delivered the conflict like no other. I enjoyed the split map (though all that orange!), air system, and overall simplicity of play.

A memorable game, to be sure.

An absolutely great John Hill design. I have the 1st edition. It was hard getting used to that map sun glasses help! Two copies just in case. I ironed my map with a moist towel a dry towel, and a hot iron. and it flattened right out. Seemed like the map was a tiny bit to big for the box. It put a perma roll in it.

Sadly, this one got lost in one of my moves and I've not yet been able to replace it. One of the unusual aspects of the game was that you could rebuild one of every three units you lost in battle, meant to simulate recovery and repair of damaged vehicles. Also the process of shuttling between fronts made the strategic effort on either end of the war pretty critical. Very enjoyable game.

A pretty good game by John Hill. Unfortunately the map is downright ugly. It didn't get the play time it deserved because we couldn't bear to look at it for very long.

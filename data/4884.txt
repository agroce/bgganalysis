This game is a cosim gem and I probably would even consider it  underrated (maybe just because the title did no attract, who knows). Quality is ok, well as it was 10 years ago, I really like the look of the counters, particularly the one of the armored units of course. It plays well and it is very suitable for solitaire gamers out there.

LOL "the Italian Table"

Played the 2nd edition of this by snail mail once.  It worked and was fun.  It actually says in the rules that it was specifically designed for play by mail, with no hidden information nor input from the other player required during your turn.  I wish more modern games were like this, it is hard to find a PBEM-suitable game without going back to ancient, crude designs.

Interestingly the third, Terran edition has fog of war introduced, which makes me wonder whether it is suitable for PBEM or not.

It was frustrating being the Allies and having such crappy tanks, the German armor rating seemed out of hand in 1941.  88's are one thing but it seems hard to believe the regular PzKw Mark III's were that superior to the Allied tanks.

RATING: 5
I was really intrigued when I first read about this game in detail.  I found a copy of the Terran edition at a very reasonable cost and was immediately engaged.  The Legend Begins has refreshing ideas 20 years after its release.

I love the treatment of combat losses.  You really worry about preserving your forces while attempting to reach sane objectives.  You withdraw mauled units from the front lest their cadre be eliminated.  You start to care about your forces in a way that most consims discourage let alone willfully ignore.

The treatment of supply is appropriate.  Sure it is pick-up and deliver - it has to be given the theater and its limited modes of transport.  But the supply system captures the challenges of the theater without bogging down the game as treatments such as OCS' DAK does for example.

The chit pull system employed is good as well.  Great for solitaire play and adds that uncertainty that we all love in FtF games.

Unfortunately, the chit pull can be a weakness, well certainly an irritant.  Each player has four chits (in the Terran edition, players have two primary chits), but only seven will get drawn any turn.  A bad run of luck, particularly over consecutive turns, can have monumental consequences.  This happened in our second play of Crusader.  Turn 1, the CW got 3 of the 4 available chits, turn 2 they got 5 of the 7 (three pairs of consecutive pulls when paired with turn 1), turn 3 had four CW draws.  Worse still the Axis player pulled only one primary.  The "deck" seemed stacked against the Axis too far.  It's one thing not to know when you'll get to act, but one side getting 12 out of 18 turns is something else entirely.

That having been said, the Axis won the scenario (which continued into a campaign) by taking Tobruk and just *barely* holding off the CW relief force.

True, we are still learning how to plan under the constraints of the system.  For example, you should never do a low odds attack on your second chit pull in a row because if your forces become disrupted (a big hit, halving their defensive strength) they could stay disrupted for two opponent chit draws.  Worse, if it is near the turn end, they could fail to absorb replacements because they spend the inter-turn disrupted.

So understanding the nuances of the system can be *huge* and takes time.  However, I'm not certain these particular nuances represent anything valid historically.  Did major units remain disrupted for weeks at a time?  Did they go a month without refit or replacement because they were disrupted in the middle of the month?

Again, we're still learning how best to play , but I remain undecided as to whether the system is valid or if when pushed it reveals weaknesses.

I also find the game has a bit too much chrome, and despite generally excellent ergonomics, the occasional ergonomic faux pas.  Granted the chrome gives the game flavor, but it detracts from the ability to take the game off the shelf and play after a hiatus.  It certainly means your first session will get called because of a major omission, and your second session will contain its fair share of gaffs.

An example of an ergonomic quirk is the way the rulebook mentions that tank units have steps but they do not have their steps indicated on the counter as all other units do.  Most have 2 steps, Germans have 3 ... its easy to remember, but why not be consistent and burden the players less? Mechanized infantry counters have an anti-tank value of 1, but unlike any other unit their anti-tank value isn't shown on their counters.  The rulebook instructs us in these quirks, so we're pretty sure they aren't errata, but why?  Why not have all counters follow the same logic, and cut-out a few quirky exceptions, a few important caveats for the players to remember?

Bottom line, I like *a lot* about "The Legend Begins", but was left with the sense that it needs the firm hand of an independent developer to take this intriguing game and beat it into a truly great game.

That having been said, once you pick up the system, you  can look forward to some excellent sessions.  The game tells an engaging narrative: the interaction between active and limited ZOCs, the chit driven tension, and the husbandry of one's forces.  When to call it a day and when to press your luck just a bit further; this is operational consim at its best.  One of my litmus tests for a NA theater game is its Crusader scenario.  Legend's Crusader scenario is fantastic, easily the best version of the maelstrom of Crusader that I have ever gamed.

"The Legend Begins" is the most historical and engaging take on North Africa I have played.  It was invigorating to learn and sessions leave me looking forward to future plays.  It is that good, but I know, with a bit more polish, it could be even better.  

Update: I have had to dock this game's rating from a 9 to a 7 as every time we consider taking it off the shelf, we pass and play something else.  I think the game is a bit too complex for a casual evening session, and at the same time doesn't call to us when we have time for the campaign.

Update 2:  Dropped rating to a 5.
We finally convinced ourselves to put this on the table one more time.  While re-reading the rules, I wrote reminders on the map, on counters.  This is a sign that a game is monetarily worthless to me, but I want to give it as much of a chance to succeed despite poor ergonomics or too much chrome.  The session ended early with our sweeping the game off the table and into the box.  Never a good sign.  Bottom line, the game has a very low return on your investment of time.  True, the scenario we were playing (#3) had just one combat per impulse so the amount of bookkeeping overhead per turn was thrown into stark contrast.  The number of decisions to be made in a ten minute period is incredibly low.  Some might say, the pacing is too slow.

The game has many interesting ideas but in the end it is an experiment that failed to engage us, particularly during low action scenarios.

Very good game, I think the deluxe edition detracts from this gem. It's really a game to try, Great teaching value as well. I prefer DAK but this one is much more manageble. BEWARE it takes quite a while to play. Highly recomended

RATING: 4
The confusing reserve & replacement rules, combined with a chit draw system, are reason enough for me to dislike this game.

If that weren't enough, the major attack rules change in the unpublished 4th edition lead me to believe that the game may have been tested on a per-scenario basis, but the full campaign was probably not tested much. As it stands in the 3rd edition, Graziani will put Rommel to shame as he rolls up the British and drives on Mersa Metruh, while the 4th edition rules might seriously hamper the Germans or British in the long run.

Several elements of this game should have been abstracted away, but are instead represented literally. I loathe moving supply and replacement units around the board. This seems to be something the designer (smartly) abstracted away in all of his subsequent games.

Sold.

good design and decent production (third edition).  

better than Afrika II as supply is less fiddly (no counting units every turn) and movement speeds are lower, so it is easier to see all of the potential moves.

a bit disappointed as I am more interested in the campaign than the individual scenarios and playing the Legend Begins campaign would be a monster (7 segments * 56 turns).  given the length of the campaign and the fact that it wasn't part of the earlier editions, I wonder how much playtesting was done on it.

the other issue I have is high stacking limits with small hexes; this makes it much more fiddly than it needs to be.

aside from the above, I think the scenarios are quite playable and the Legend Begins strikes the best balance of the operational North African games I have played (Afrika II, DAK2, Legend Begins).

Shifting Sands remains my favorite for the whole campaign.  What SS loses in accuracy, it makes up for in actual playability.

Very very good simulation of North Africa!  I love seeing the evolution of British armor over the course of the game. Great system with only a few confusing rules. There are published clarifications by the designer which clear things up. Accurate OB aside from a few little mistakes. 

Totally recommended!!!

I remember a great campaign with the 2nd edition in my home with 5 friends, and it was great fun!!!
The air rules have some problem, but with a house-rule and some hot-discussion we resolve the problem.
For the Italian wargamers the Italian Table is a bad thing, not all Italian military forces were so bad.
All in all for a wargamer it is a must.

The Legend Begins very well for Mark Simonitch and his company Rhino Games.  Mark's quality in design was proven to be good gor gaming experience as well as a strong sense of realism.  The right factors are in for his every design.  This particular theatre has been very suitable for designer to get a good initial start because of the general good gaming situation and balance of both sides coming back and forth over the northern coast of Africa.  Charismatic leaders like O'Connor and Rommel, and the less than usual appearance, say in Europe, of the Commonwealth forces like Australians and Indians, make this kind of game more appealing to the masses.  Overall, a very very good gaming system and tense movement.  An excellent design and prodduction too.

Very clever system with chitpull-driven sequence of play.  Probably the best of the "moderate" sized North Africa games.  Does need a few houserules for the campaign, but also has a scenario for every major battle, and most of these are doable in one evening.  Great map, probably Simonitch's best to this day.

Deluxe edition is the one to go for, the counters are rather garish compared to the much more tasteful ones in the 1st or 2nd edition, but the massively expanded scope easily makes up for that.

Best game on the subject. There is a lot of detail (differentiatd unit types, mobile ZOC vs infantry ZOC, damaged tanks, wounded, port destruction, invasion of Malta) giving a very realistic operational feel, but the game remains simple enough. The emphasis is on managing logistics and casualty rates, which can be very high during the battles. The action/reaction system gives realistic movement rates and makes it possible to simulate short, intense battles as well as rapid advances without giving 60 movement factors to every unit like in some other games.

Solid game. Fairly simple yet it manages to capture all the essential aspects of the north african campaign : the see saw nature of the fighting and the emphasis on supply and shipping. It combines a high attrition combat system with all the maneuvering you expect from desert warfare; and the chit pull system with variable movement allowances works really well.

pros : great replayability with 7 scenarios and the chit pull system, modest table space.

cons : suffers a bit from the big stack of death syndrome at times, lots of combat factor halving and rounding, the campaign is not really an option, it is more about the scenarios.

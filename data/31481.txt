Fresh, innovative, great fun. The pressure to build a perfect ship in the first phase gives way to the chaos that happens in the second phase when the action cards are turned over but the overall game is a great experience and it doesn’t really matter too much who wins.

Surprisingly fun, about as much as it sounds. Building the ships is lots of fun though a little stressful. Watching your ship get destroyed is fun also. Watching the ships get destroyed is fun too and you don't care too much if you win or lose.

Very similar to Dungeon Lords, but instead of a super fun turn-based bluffing game to build up your dungeon, we get a crazy grab-a-tile-quick-and-hope-it-works-and-someone-else-didn't-get-the-tile-you-wanted-in-the-meantime sort of thing.  Dungeon Lords is better.  For me, anyway.

It's a bit random when you get to the space flight portion of the game, but you have opportunities to see 3/4ths of the cards that will be played as you are building your ship, so even there you can plan ahead. This game is not for everyone, but I always have a fun time playing it.

Great concept but quickly lost its appeal for me. Expansions too expensive to gamble on giving the game what it (might have) needed. Probably a hit with older kids.

game was okay.  I didn't really care for the tile reveal and ship building step, which is of course about half of the game.  I am also not crazy about one diceroll completely ravaging you.  Components were nice, and I liked the theme.  They just lost me a bit in the execution.

RATING: 7
A thematic, original, fun/light/silly racing game with a semi-unique tile-laying component.

The game is played out over 3 rounds, with the goal being to obtain the most money.  At the start of each round, you construct your spaceship out of bits and pieces off the scrap heap (tiles, many of which are hidden), however you have to do this using a "Factory Fun" style mad grab for the tiles, and do it with a time limit as well.  This results in sub-optimal ships being constructed as it's also VERY important to finish building your ship first, so you can start first.

Next comes the first of 3 races.  Each race involves a series of event cards, many of which are complete screwjobs (asteroids, pirates, diseases etc.), with some being good opportunites to score points (acquired goods, defeating pirates, etc.).  Points are also awarded at the end of the race for finishing the race (yes, sometimes you will NOT be able to finish the race!), and for having the best constructed ship (at least the best surviving ship).

Each subsequent race, your ship is larger and therefore a bit more crazy to build, and the race is longer (more event cards).  The winner is the person with the most money at the end of all the races.  The interesting thing is that it is possible to do poorly in the first 2 races and still win the game if you finish strong.  

The game is fairly light and cannot be taken too seriously.  It is more of an experience game, as it is quite fun, very original and thematic, and has excellent components.  Seems to scale well from 2-4 players.  Definitely a game that would benefit from expansions as well, and I think there's one coming out soon.  Chvatil is definitely a designer to watch with this and Through the Ages under his belt.

RATING: 7
First play and first impression were not bad, though the first part of space ship (galaxy truck) setting is bit chaotic especially towards the third round.  We were playing with four players and during the third round every body was just fighting for the small parts...
Some discipline such as strict observations of the rules of hour glass and picking of parts would be necessary.
Likely to increase the rating on more plays.

Very cool and fun puzzle-ish game where you have to build your space ship, and then go out and try to make money while not getting blasted to pieces. It has cool little space dude pieces, nice looking cards, and a cool theme. It's great fun going out and exploring deep space, finding planets with goods on them or possibly pirates that will attack you and destroy sections of your ship. You have to try to take home the most valuable cargo while fighting off pirates, slavers, and asteroids, and get back before the other players. I've played a couple other puzzle-type games before, but GT was by far the most entertaining, probably in part due to the theme. Though you know what most of the upcoming cards will be, the game has a nice 'exploration' type feeling to it. Seeing your ship be torn to pieces, but still cruise along through space and barely survive is cool and exciting.

The "Combat zone" cards or whatever they are called probably do a good job of simulating everybody getting caught in some kind of battle (some interstellar war going on or something?) and the weakest player get thrashed, but the "combat zone" cards don't give any context or anything, so I was left thinking, "What is happening here? Are we fighting each other? Are we all being attacked or something?" That card could of been done better.

The only other thing I can think of that would make the game way cooler would be some pasted-on Star Wars theme or something like that. Each player is a smuggler who is building/fitting their transport and trying to pick up illegal goods and make it back to Nar Shadda or wherever the start planet is to sell their stuff. Bounty Hunters, Imperials, Mynocks/space slugs, and local law enforcement try to blow you up. Throw in places like Kessel, Tatooine, etc., give the goods more flavor, like spice, weapons, stuff like that. I always called the brown aliens Wookies anyway; they should be Wookies!

Just a thought.

Vlaada, why? Why did you ruin such a good idea with a bad game implementation?

The designer is always coming up with intriguing and original game mechanisms, but seems completely obsessed with burying them in complex non-intuitive rules because...EUROGAMERS!

The whole game of Galaxy Trucker should be as fast paced and exciting as the ship building. But it's not. You build a ship--fun--then grind for VPs through a bunch of event cards--holy boring-my-face-off, Batman. Ships rarely even blow up as advertised.

RATING: 7
Lots of fun, but after a while certain fool proof stratgies emerge, ending up in the more dexterous/quick thinking player (and some might say, less ethical...cheating) with a big advantage over the others. However, (and from that it is understood I am not that player) building a ship and then watching it get blown to smithereens never gets old - and this game, for all its shortcoming, is one that I have never failed to enjoy.

A fairly chaotic game with a build your own ship twist.  Some luck can be mitigated at times.  However, that chaos also makes this great fun and no game is ever the same.  Plenty of crazy things can happen and sometimes a lot of praying that your ship holds together for just one more round.

I enjoy playing this game. It's light, easy enough to for new players, plays relatively quickly, and is just plain fun regardless of what happens. Sometimes, you fear each card, knowing your ship is poorly built... and you come out fine. Sometimes, you get amazingly bad luck and your actually-good ship falls apart. Still, despite the huge luck element, the best players do tend to win. And really, it's fun for everyone regardless: you built three ships, you had three voyages full of potentially-hilarious things happening to your ships, and you made money. Happy to have this one in my collection, still thinking about whether I need any expansions.

Sehr gutes Spiel, welches sich in 2 Runden gliedern läßt. Eine Speedrunde wo simultan alle Spieler ihr Raumschiff ausstatten so gut es geht. Dabei gilt es aus den gemeinsam zur Verfügung stehenden Plättchen sich die passenden zusammenzusuchen, was nicht einfach ist, da die anderen Spieler sich aus dem gleichen Pool bedienen und somit Gute Teile auch schnell vergriffen sind.
In der 2. Phase fliegen dann alle gebauten Raumschiffe auf der gleichen Route und versuchen möglichst viel Geld dabei zu machen und nach Möglichkeit natürlich nicht kaputt zu gehen. Nach Zieleinlauf gibts dann eine Wertung und dann folgen noch 2 Runden mit dem gleichen Prinzip, wobei die Raumschiffe größer werden und die Gefahren gefährlicher. Sehr lustiges Spiel, aber am besten, wenn man es mit 4 Leuten spielt.

Ugly game (garish components) with a novel tile-grabbing mechanism. After the brief ship-building phase, everything else is auto-pilot. It is fun watching ships being blown apart, but I suspect it may become repetitive with very little real strategy involved. What a very odd game. But I could see some fun in it.

LIKE: chaos! putting the ships together, then blowing them up is fun.

DISLIKE: Can be very swingy with luck and the chances you take. Being eliminated from a round is awful.

OVERALL: Fun, but not a game to play too often. Experience really plays a part but nice handicapping rules to help even it out.

RATING: 6.5
Just really fast paced fun. Probably isn't a game you'd want to play time after time, but for a clean frolic filler, this one will do just fine. The production values are amazing - just right. It plays fast with any number of players (I imagine) and offers up a decent challenge while delivering laughs right from the belly. Only take back is the self-indulgent rulebook that spends too much time on yucks and not enough time just getting to the point! Still, a fun game.

Construye tu nave lo mejor posible, y en el mejor tiempo que puedas, en plan puzzle a contrareloj, y prepárate para abordar numerosos eventos de 3 niveles (cartas), sobretodo negativos, y consigue ser el que mejor salga parado y con más recursos. El que mejor lo haga, recibirá mas créditos espaciales y será el ganador. Un juego tipo puzzle frenético, donde se "sufre" y ves sufrir también mucho (Ha-ha! xD), bastante dependiente de la suerte, pero al fin y al cabo entretenido, sobretodo si te gustan los puzzles. Eso si, la primera parte es muy divertida y loca, pero la segunda parte del juego es muy pasiva, aburrida, y tampoco hay interacción entre los jugadores, cosa que le hace bajar muchísimo la nota... Es practicamente independiente del idioma. Fundas Usa moradas x1 o naranjas. Donado

Galaxy Trucker is an example of a game that is much more complicated to explain than it is to play. It also comes with an awful amount of bits and pieces that are great looking but also add to the duration of setup and cleanup.

What I like the most about GT is that it genuinely is fun to play. The initial hurry with ship building and the unpredictable events all complement each other. It is so fun that I do not actually mind if my ship gets blown into pieces. One might even say that the game gets boring on the day when you have mastered the building process and manage to get home unhurt time after time. I guess this is why they brought the expansions with rougher events to the market.

Here you have the biggest shortcoming of the game. While offering a challenge at first, it quickly becomes a bit easy and repetitive. You are always executing the same style of blueprints and the events offer you no surprises. At that point, all you have left is the ship building, which is still great fun.

However, I chose to sell my copy of the game since I got somewhat bored with it. I had my eye on the expansions but finally judged that they would make the game even harder to explain and maintain, thus creating a behemoth that requires too much energy to control for it to be fun anymore. This is also the reason, I am degrading the rating from 8 to 7. Galaxy Trucker is great fun for a time but you have to ready to invest into an expansion to keep it fresh. And to get to play that expansion, you need a group of sworn fans of GT so that you are not required to teach the game more than once. 

Personally, I am more than happy to play anytime.

Fun ship building game with lots of sillyness. Expansion is required after a few plays though to make the game more difficult since it becomes quite easy when you're adept at ship building.

I have a love-hate relationship with the expansion.  The new stuff is fun.  But it seems the expansion slows the game down a bit.  Perhaps it's just my groups' lack of experience with the new bits and cards, but it seems like there's a bit more thought into the flights.

That's not a bad thing.  But part of the game's great appeal was that it was so quick.  Perhaps with time it'll speed back up.

An agility game, where players will have to build their ship by picking tiles from the middle with a time limit. The ship needs a balance of engine, laser cannon, shield generator, goods storage, battery and crew member while checking for mistake in connections. Player also get to 'recruit' alien as well to boost engine and/or cannon power. After building the ship, each player's ship will go through an adventure. Ships get to land and collect goods, saving abandoned ships and shooting the enemies - to collect points. However, there's also threats from meteor, pirates and slayers constantly trying to destroy the ship and forcing player to 'give up'. Player with highest points wins.

It's fun. Witness the funniest and ugliest ships ever built. Laughed and laughed everytime this game is played.

Rating after one play of two rounds with two players.  Not sure I'm going to dig the timed element, but it was pretty cool.  Weird pacing, though.  "Where is the game?  Is it the assembly?  The flight?"

I love the rules--they're funny, but I will need to make a player aid to condense the pertinent info to one page.  The rulebook scatters the info across many, many pages.

Update: Full game under my belt now.  Neat game.  Heart pounding.  Fun in ways that are hard to quantify.  Definitely unique.

+ Love the puzzle-building aspect of the game; Making quick decisions on what to add to your ship and what kind of risks to take makes this a pretty tense game.

Building the ship has been the best part and where the heart of the game seems to reside.  So far, I do not get the sense of chaotic excitement others report about the flight period, but then, I've only played with two players (and my opponent shies away from aggressive play in games).  That dynamic makes the flight feel more like a test of the building skills exhibited in the building period rather than a distinct game.  I really want to test this out with three other players who will delight in the destruction of the fruits of their labor.

RATING: 7
Very fun!

Downgraded from 9 to 8 (5/01/08).  (And I thought my rating would go up!)

I really enjoy this game, but there's a strong inequality between experienced players and inexperienced ones.  For the ship construction phases, experience *really* pays off.  I've won most of my games (plays 2-5, I think) because I'm good at looking at the cards and building a ship I want to fly.

While the luck elements are certainly present (dice-rolling for asteroids and laser fire, for example), construction skill dramatically offsets them.

My next step probably should be printing out the Rough Road expansion cards and handicapping myself with them when I play new players.  Even if I were to do that, I'm not sure it would raise my rating.  Can't say I think I'm a huge fan of a game that requires its owner to handicap himself in order to play with others.

Downgraded from 8 to 7 (4/08/09).  The expansion, or at least the Rough Road Ahead cards, improves on the basic game so much that I will never play without it.  NEVER.

I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Fast, crazy and silly. I enjoy this game because of the frenetic action that offers, its originality and the idea of building a spaceship. Of course it's far from being a strategic game, because it's chaotic over every possible limit, but it's a fun filler and completely unique.

I have a couple of problems with the game, that are not so big at the end of the day: 1) The randomness: I know it's supposed to be part of the fun, but you can really be annihilate by not drawing the tiles you need, by getting the wrong cards or the wrong dice rolls. I know I should enjoy it here - and I partially do, but simply I cannot accept it completely. 2) The Scoring: Again it's a smaller issue, but I keep disliking the scoring sistems of this designer, because they seem a little unrefined to me.

Still Galaxy Trucker is a good game - especially with the right people at the table, which can amplify the laughter that the game already brings.

Super game which combines a number of mechanics for an original game and experience. Building the ships is fun, and then watching what happens to it even more fun.  I'm curious to see what happens as some players get better at building vs. playing new people.  I think there will be a skill gap.

There's a lot more to this game in the build phase than I was expecting from the Geek reviews; on the other hand, because it's less of a frenzy than I expected, I have a bit of a worry that build optimisation looms if you played it a few times in a row.  However, as long as one was sensible about mixing this game in and out, I think it would stay around for a long time as a regular and enjoyable game.  (That's a strange category - 'Good game to occasionally bring out as long as there's a large collection' - and I knocked half a point off my score once I realised I was consigning GT to this group.  On sheer fun first time around, without these worries about longish term replayability, it came in at an 8 for me.)

Why I think you should play this:

*To me, this is actually the best PIRATE game out there. You customize your ship, smuggle cargo, fight off enemies and war with other players. The pirate aesthetic means different things to different people, but for mine, this game does pirate better than anything else. 

*The real-time aspect is fun, but more importantly it involves rich choices, something I've not seen a lot of in multiplayer, real-time, games.

Vlaada Chvatil may well be my favourite designer. What impresses me is his range.

On one end of the scale we have the manic, frantic space ship building shenanigans on offer here - in stark contrast to the very brain intensive Through The Ages it is possible to have a great time here on your very first go.

Once you have built a spaceship from ill-fitting, ill-suited components, it flies across the galaxy (well, a bunch of cards are drawn - use your imagination!) and gets smashed to bits.

Or not.

It depends how well you built your ship.

Unless you were really unlucky.

It also has one of the funniest rulebooks ever, but does require a bit of front loading of rules (the components are varied and wonderful) but it's more than worth it.

A fabulous game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A lot of fun + jigsaw-like tile placement and cute components. Sold! =)

Pulled this off from a shelf after almost a year long break. The first play with only 2 players. I would say, a little fun, but not too engaging with only 2 of us. Take it or leave it. Probably, we should try it with an expansion. It's a pity we only have a 2nd one.

-> Would prefer Anniversary if it didn't cost an arm and a leg.
-> As Russian edition's cards differ from the expansion's ones (and for now there are no news on localizing addons), we got English cards from Czech Games.

If I owned this game, it would be trade piled. I hate this with a passion. There is probably nothing more I dislike than an egg timer in a game. And there is nothing more I dislike than fighting players real-time in a mad rush for tiles to build a ship before the timer is through. As a new player, I also had a big disadvantage because I didn't know to scramble for key tiles until we got to the third round. Ugh and double ugh.The only redeeming quality of the game is the quite fun event cards that play after your ship has been built, which "battleship" your ship or grant it resources or money.

RATING: 7
The best part about this game is building the ship. That seems to be the part of the game with the most interaction and the 'funnest' part of the game by far. Flying your newly built ship through the dangerous galaxy is a mere plus. I for one enjoy watching my ship get blown to bits. It's definitely a a tongue in cheek game and one that will need the right mindset to be enjoyed to its fullest. If your group is hypercompetitive and enjoys working through clever uses of mechanics and solving a game's efficiency puzzle then Galaxy Trucker might not be for you.

However, if your group enjoys a fun game with great components then pick up this game immediately.

RATING: 1
I'm always worried when a game comes packaged with an egg timer. Well, Galaxy Trucker is in fact pretty fun at first. The timer does at least make sense—the idea being that it keeps you honest so you definitely make as rickety a ship as possible. The game is an absolute blast...for about 2 minutes. Once you're done frantically assembling your ship from random parts (and many of the shipbuilding rules regarding facedown tiles are unanimously agreed to be stupid), you then...watch a movie for about 20 minutes wherein all the ships get subjected to dice and cards. Fun.

Except not fun. At all. It's just on-rails at that point. I don't mind a rickety piece of space junk dying like a garbage fire, I mind not being able to really do anything. The choices are insipid: do the risky thing or not do the risky thing. Great. Well, if you're ahead you don't take risks and if you're behind you do. Woo. Any knucklehead can play this "game", though it's hard to call it one in good conscience.

It feels like there's a much better game about building ships and sending them out on an adventure that got buried in some insane person's garbage fire of ideas. I would say that's the worst part of it but it's not: the components. Those little spacemen and the ugly ships...just really every piece in this game is ugly or out of place. It reminds me a lot of how Mage Knight felt like a bunch of spare board game parts were dumped in a pile. I wonder if Mage Knight and Galaxy Trucker are connected somehow...?

Give Vlaada's game a pass. Again. It's just a good idea wrapped in a bad game.

RATING: 7.5
Definitely a puzzle-building game, and I'm not a fan of puzzle building games.
I was disappointed in that it wasn't anywhere near as "fun" as I had been led to believe: in this case, the fun of madly scrambling to produce a "perfect" space ship, and the fun of watching it getting blown apart. I didn't find too much tension in building ships; and I didn't find the "blowing up" part overly engaging. Give me Pan Chvatil's Space Alert for that!
I mean, it's a perfectly fine game; but, for me, it wasn't at all the madcap romp and race that I had been led to believe it was. 
Then there are the rules. The rules are just too complicated for a game that is so light. I'd have no problem with the rulebook if the game were heavier.

Pretty cool build and destroy game.  You first build your ship in a "mad grab" for the best components, then everyone sets sail with their space ships to see who survives the destruction.  The destruction (mostly) comes at all ships with the same type and same location of problems, so the best designed ship will usually win; however, if you have one weak spot, it may get hit during an unlucky roll, making your great design fall to pieces.

The iPad version is a lot of fun, but I'm not sure how much set up/clean up is involved in the tabletop version.  It's cool to build a crazy looking ship and see what it can do.  You can play against each other for score, but you can also enjoy building a ship that is aesthetically pleasing to you and testing it out.  I'm astounded that a game like this was designed by the guy who did Codenames and Through the Ages.

RATING: 6
Galaxy Trucker is quite a bit less strategic than I initially expected. There is a lot of chaos in the tactical decisions you must make, and I'm not entirely certain if the game is balanced very well at all. Despite that, I still find it to be a fun game for what it is. There is a certain charm in being forced to quickly cobble together a good ship that will stay intact for your journey through space. 

But every time I've played it there have been players that are dramatically better/worse at riding the chaos to the point where the competition just isn't very fun for them. I suppose that's the nature of a real-time chaos driven game, but it does hold GT back for me. I personally enjoy it, but the disparity in skill level can make some sessions dramatically more fun and other sessions dramatically less fun.

Lo mejor del juego es la fase en la que, contra reloj, tienes que construir una nave teniendo en cuenta ciertas reglas de colocación de losetas.

I think 95% of the fun is watching terrible things happen to your spaceship sort of at random.  Which is cool, I guess.

I really enjoy the dynamic of this and don't have an issue with seeing my ship blow up at all (actually, sometimes I prefer it).  My girlfriend, however, takes some issue with seeing her ship get destroyed (not badly enough to avoid playing) and she doesn't handle the ship-building quite as adeptly (thinking too much about placement) so that she gets upset as I flip the timer.  I find myself giving her some additional time to put together a good ship.  Sort of spoils it but I enjoy the game.

The first half of each round is a speed puzzle in which you assemble your ship.  In the second half, cards are flipped and your ship is nibbled away by various hazards.  There are a few decisions in the second half but they're all bleeding obvious.  You do this three times, building progressively bigger ships to face more powerful hazards.  

Such player interaction as exists lies solely in robbing an opponent of the tile or goods they want.  The two times I've played, Galaxy Trucker has taken way over the published 60 minutes. One for the jigsaw puzzlers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Although this is a family favourite an argument will usually break out at some point - normally whenever the timer gets flipped. Good for my kids from 8+ as long as you give them time to build.

Random enough to give everyone a chance, but not entirely at the mercy of the dice / cards, it's a good balance for a lightish family game.

RATING: 7
Reminds me of Robo Rally, for two related reasons:
1. there's a strategy phase followed by a just-follow-the-instructions-and-watch-what-happens-phase;
2. game mechanics have some cool concepts but I'm not convinced they translate into a game with interesting strategy.

RATING: 8
Really a fun game, but the shipbuilding part is a little unbalanced between experienced and inexperienced players.

RATING: 8
Build you ship, send it to space and see how is blown into pieces.

There can't be any more simple than that, if you want to spend a game session full of laughs, frustration and sometimes a bit of rage, you are going to love Galaxy Trucker.

DON'T expect a high tactical game here, this is a light game to spend a fun gaming session full of laughs and curses.

Light but really fun game. Played only with 2. There is much luck involved (dice rolling, event cards) but experienced player should win more often. Looking forward to play this game again, especially with bigger group. I'm curious how the dynamic of the game will change.

You cannot take this game seriously if you want to enjoy it.  It's a long filler with so much chaos baked in that it makes Fluxx look like a modern eurogame.

Fun, frenetic, skilled (but ultimately learnable and repetitive) ship building action, followed by tense, highly random, card turning.

This will be one that comes out every so often particularly with younger family and friends who don't play games so much.

RATING: 7
I can see  why some people love this game, but the first play was a bit chaotic. It didn't help that we played with the Big Expansion. The game probably becomes better and better after repeated play, but I'm not sure I will ever play it again.

EDIT: After 2nd game the game feels better. The biggest problem is the playing time which seems to be too long. This may also change after some playes. Rating moved to 7.

RATING: 7
After four plays, it has become rather easy to build a ship that endures the flight. I've played each of the four games with another group of players, which were playing the game for the first time. Some of them struggled a bit when designing their ships, some of them got the concept right away, but every one of them enjoyed the game. It's a fun and light game that can be unforgiving on players sometimes. I'm looking forward to playing it more.

I love making the ships and completely destroying them. Winning the game is fine but destruction is "funner" 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Given time, I imagine that building the ships would become a bit too "easy" and the game would then turn monotonous, but so far plays frenetically silly, which is great.

In comparison to Dungeon Lords, I prefer the speed of play in this as Dungeon Lords played really slow for my group both in terms of gameplay and the resolution phase.

For another similar puzzle-esque games, be sure to check out Factory Fun.

The premise is really bizarre; build a space ship out of pipes and go fly it. Everything goes horribly wrong right from the start as bits start falling off. Laugh at the hideous series of events that tear your ship apart. Laugh more at the broken ship everyone makes it back with. Winner is whomever sucked the least. Incredibly fun game.

Space is my favorite theme, so it gets points right of the box, and the manual might be my favorite of all time.

Assembling a ship in real-time while competing with your opponents for the parts you need is the star of the show here, but even running the race itself keeps you on the edge of your seat.

[ESP] Este juego me gustó muchísimo más de lo que esperaba, aunque la verdad me lo imaginaba muy distinto. El juego tiene 3 ciclos. Al rpincipio de cada uno hay una etapa en la que cada jugador intenta armar su nave de la mejor manera posible con las piezas que están al centro de la mesa. (esto es casi un puzzle) En la segunda etapa las naves comienzan su recorrido, el el cual podrán obtener bienes en planetas pero también deberán enfrentarse a peligros como meteoritos y ataques.

RATING: 7
A LOT of fun.

Building the ships is chaotic, and you're usually pressed for time, and some of the ships you end up with are just ATROCIOUS to look at.  But they're nice and random and interesting.  It's a lot of fun, just building them.

Going through the delivery... well.. it's usually disastrous.  You will most certainly not make it unscathed, but it is STILL fun.  Can you handle all the challenges, from Pirates to Slavers, to asteroids?  Only if your chaotically built hunk of parts happened to be prepared for it!

Highly recommended for a fun game to pass an hour or two =).

Recently dropped my rating down some.  The game is still a lot of fun, but in truth, after the 'ship building' stage, what do you really do?  You just watch to see if your ship makes it.  It's still fun to watch, but there's not a lot of actual gaming going on.

RATING: 7
The only other Chvatil game I've played is Prophecy, but contrasting the two I'm just super-impressed with the designer's skills.  Fantastic bits, very fun and understandable rulebook.  Possibly sits in a tough spot where it's hard on non-gamers and also less experienced players, but it's got enough random elements to frustrate the hardcore.  That's presently of little concern to me though, because I still dig it.  Build your ship with real-time fun, then roll through the experience deck and see what happens.  It can get especially fun if the adventure turns into a trainwreck.

I throughly enjoy this game.  The puzzle nature of the first phase of each round is very intriguing.  A lot of your final score depends on the cards you hit in the journey phase, which means you don't have a lot of control, but you definitely see the value of building your ship well.  I always have a great time playing, even when I get blasted out of the sky.

If you enjoy puzzles, humor, and can enliven your game with crazy stories, then this game provides a nice palette for you to paint from.  From the absurd construction of your ship to the often ridiculous odds of flying through space with reckless abandon - you will have opportunity for humor and good times.  So why doesn't the game rate higher?  Game play can end up feeling like you had all but one engine pod blown off and your drifting through hoping to get to the end.  Its suppose to be a haphazard, seat of your pants experience.  If you are building perfect ships you are missing the point.  If you are handling the obstacles with anything close to tedious attention, you've gone 'Major Tom'.  Play it like the rules are written - with tongue firmly in cheek.

Rating is a 9 for kids, and 8 for adults.  May not be the deepest game in the galaxy, but it's fun to build ships and then watch them fall apart.  I find this game to be screaming fun all over.  During the race portion you should try to be first or second.  More methodical players do not care for this one because the first portion is a race to build a spaceship as fast as you can

If you liked Factory Fun, you'll like this.

Try to avoid the 1st ed. unless it's been upgraded.  The pieces aren't compatible with the expansions, and the spaceships are very sharp.

Had seen three others playing before I had my first game and had read some of the rules as well.
Still wasn't sure of everything that was needed for the ship, made a mistake in one connection didn't have a great spread of types.
2010-07 After another 18 months I'll play this almost whenever I can. Still don't think I'm good enough to need the expansion.
2014-10 I've played with boards from both the big expansions, and the Latest Models. I don't feel they're as difficult to deal with as others seem to. But I don't always do as well as I feel I ought to.

Rated after two plays.  I wanted this because I find another game by Vlaada, Space Alert, to be utterly fantastic.  Galaxy Trucker, though, definitely isn't in the same league.  The building phase is sort of fun, and I love the puzzle aspect with all the connectors.  The problem is that the sand timer just isn't implemented well; why is it even in the game?  The cd tracks in Space Alert made sense because your ship is about to explode!

It's also enjoyable to see your ship torn apart, but I can see that getting old after a few more plays.  Still, it's an extremely original game and one that I wouldn't mind playing every now and then.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game is a blast. The puzzle aspect of putting your ship together simultaneously keeps the flow of the game going. The second phase in which you go through a series of adventures is a real hoot! Players will get better but expect to see some nasty beat up ships at the end of your first couple of rounds. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The shipbuilding part of this game is genius.  Really original and fun. I admit I was dubious when I first read about it, but it really works.  Which makes the second part just a bit of a letdown.  Flipping over cards to "see what happens" isn't nearly as exciting or interesting.

Vlaada's easiest game to just pull out and play. This is probably my go-to three-player game. Wonderful space-zaniness and destructiveness. It's a decently long game, though - I expect that I'll probably want to skip the first race when playing with experienced players, as it doesn't have as interesting choices and doesn't affect final scores very much.

RATING: 9
This one is a hoot. On paper, it really should not work - you have the "ship-building" part of the game, which feels like space Carcasssonne on ecstasy, and the lengthier "flight" part which is basically playing itself. And yet it works great. Everything is so charming and breezy, from the rulebook, to the components and gameplay. It's hard to play this game without a constant grin on your face.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8

A big yet very silly game. Taking the role of interstellar mechanics/pilots, players over the course of three rounds randomly pull tiles from the board to build spaceships, trying to build the best ship in the shortest amount of time. Then they go through a series of events, sometimes positive (like find a station and loot the place, or a bunch of planets were you get goods from), but mostly negative (like pirates and asteroids that take plunder and destroy your ship).

As I said, it's silly. The rules were great at both teaching the game and providing nice little quotes for everybody to laugh at. While you send lots of time staring at your own player board, the theme and the game structure creates jovial atmosphere. I find interesting one how vague the win conditions are (IIRC, if you have any credits left, a winner is you, and if you have the most credit, more of a winner is you).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Excelente juego. Muy sencillo de explicar. con muy buenas mecanicas y que deja momentos de buenas risas. creo que es demasiado caro para los momentos que da y aun así necesario de tener. El objetivo es fabricar una nave y llegar el primero al destino llevando de todo un poco. Al final el juego se reduce a la diversion de montar la nave y de ver como se va quedando en nada... lo de menos el viaje y la puntuación. Así que como juego logra divertir una buena parte del tiempo. Pero la sensación que deja al final no es la del Caylus ni lo pretende. Es para lo que es: excelentes momentos con mis cuñadas... Creo que va a ser el siguiente que saque en mesa para mis amigos después de una cena.

While a bit long for such a light game, it's still a rollercoaster of fun. We played it for the first time last weekend, 4-player, and while it took 2+ hours to a complete game, we felt as it time ran by really fast.

The only possible problem is that people could take forever to build the ship, but that's what the sand timer is for! All in all, a really fun experience.

UPDATE: It's just not up there with my all-time favorites, but it's really close. I absolutely love this game.

Building the ships is the best part of this game,  and the components are great. The more aggressive the players, the more fun this game is, if you play relaxed and let everyyone take their time building a perfect ship, thenthe flight portion can be boring.

Good fun.  An 'experience' game.  Build your rocket as well as you can and quicker than your opponents.  Then face the hazards.  There's not much to do after your rocket is built, but both the building and journey, dodging the asteroids, are engaging if you don't take your games too seriously.

RATING: 9
Wow.  So far this has been fantastic fun!

The game is basically split into 2 phases for each of it's 3 turns.  The first phase is where most of the real decision making comes into play as players race to construct a star-ship that is fast and sturdy with plenty of space for crew and cargo, and with enough laser cannons to deal with hostiles.

this is all done in real time as players grab the components they need from a big pile of face down tiles.  tiles with components you want are installed on your ship (Carcassonne style, where the sides of the pieces generally have to match up) tiles you dont care for are placed back in the pile face UP and available to everyone to pick up.

There are incentives to finish first and penalties for recklessly built space craft which creates a nice tension between being careful and fast.

The second phase is the voyage where a random event card is dealt and the players see if their starships are up to whatever challenges the galaxy can throw at them.  Players will be bombarded by meteor showers, assaulted by pirates, race through empty space, and snatch up juicy cargo for bonus bucks.

It's great fun.

There's a lot that can go wrong in a voyage and well built ships can still be foiled by bad luck.  Still...the best ship will usually score the most points.  It's not a brain-burner on the level of Tigris and Euphrates, but there are some interesting decisions to be made and a lot of fun to be had a long the way.

Hilarious fun. A game where losing ends up being much more fun than winning.

Unfortunately, my playgroup has mastered it to the point where we can coast the races with minimal damage. I've picked up the Big Expansion because I've read it solves just such an issue by ramping up the difficult level. I hope that's true, because it would be a shame to shelve the game because we became "too good at it".

Elsőre nagyon a hatása alá kerültem, teljesen egyedi a játékmenete. Néhány parti után azonban már hibának érzem azt, hogy nagyon nagy a szerencse szerepe. Túl nagy. A legjobban összerakott űrhajót is legyőzheti egy nagyon gagyi, kezdő által épített járgány (mivel a legjobbnak is van gyengéje). Leginkább az orosz ruletthez tudnám hasonlítani:) Inkább partijáték mint stratégiai.

Majdnem napra pontosan 5 évvel az első parti után, és bő 4 évvel az utolsó parti után amit korábban játszottam a játékkal, újra előkerült, amolyan nosztalgia jelleggel. Az elsők közt vettem meg annak idején, amikor rákaptam a társasokra. Nos így sokszáz kipróbált játék után is jónak érzem, és ma már annyira nem zavar a szerencse benne, mert... ez egy ilyen játék és kész:)

Είναι τόσο εκνευριστικό που γελάς και κλαις ταυτόχρονα. 

Άγχος να προλάβεις -με το ένα χέρι- τα γαμάτα πλακίδια πριν στα πάρουν οι άλλοι, άγχος να τα τοποθετήσεις χωρίς να κάνεις λάθος γιατί δεν μπορείς να τους αλλάξεις θέση -ίσως χάσεις και τα μισά σου εξαρτήματα αν τόλμησες να κάνεις κάποιο λάθος στην τοποθέτηση, άγχος για το αν θα καταφέρεις να τελειώσεις τη συναρμολόγηση πρώτος... γιατί ο τελευταίος δεν θα περάσει καθόλου καλά.

Βρήκες σε χρόνο dt όλα όσα σου χρειάζονται για να είναι πλήρες και δυνατό το αεροσκάφος σου; Όχι; Μην ανησυχείς. Στον 1ο γύρο θα σου κάνουν ντου από παντού μετεωρίτες και εκρήξεις και θα χάσεις το μισό, στον 2ο θα σου πεθάνουν οι πιλότοι, δεν θα έχεις αποθήκες για τα υλικά σου, στον 3ο  - ποιο 3ο; Δεν θα αντέξεις καν μέχρι το 2ο.

Και δεν έφταναν όλα αυτά, προστέθηκαν και εξτρά κάρτες με καταστροφές και άλλα "αστειάκια", έτσι για να μας σπάσουν ακόμα περισσότερο τα νεύρα. 
Τρελή διασκέδαση!!!

I used to like it but after playing it after a long break I was quite bored during play. And I can actually put my finger on why - the first part of the game in which you build your ship is very fun, I like it, but the second part is the opposite - takes very long while not offering any meaningful decisions, compared to the first part it's just a boring: flip a card, roll dice, see what happens, repeat with the next 10 cards. I think I may need to renew my interest in Mondo, which is like the 1st half of Galaxy Trucker but without the 2nd part.

OMG! This is FUNNY!!! Sometimes you feel like you're watching the game rather than playing, but this can be hilarious!!
The purpose of gaming is having fun, isn't it?

Galaxy Trucker is another Vlaadaesque brilliant piece of design, about space delivery of space sewers using spaceships made with the aforementioned space sewers.

The game lasts three rounds, each one consisting of a frantic building phase and a flight phase.

The building phase is the core of the game: it is a crazy race to find the right tiles to build a viable ship, with the players working at the same time at their space vessels, drawing tiles from a common pool. When the first player completes the ship, everyone else has on last sand timer to do the same, then the flight begins.

The flight phase is about watching the ships trying to pass a various array of hazards without falling apart, and also trying to be the first reaching the final destination.
This phase has rarely any meaningful decision, but since the ships rarely manage to avoid the "falling apart" part, it is often a hilarious process of watching (hopefully) the others' being torn by asteroids. Or blasted by lascannons. Or the crews abducted by slavers. Or...

Galaxy Trucker is not a game for everyone, and not a game I'd play every day. But with the right people, in the right mood, is a BLAST!

seems quite refreshing first time, though I greatly dislike many of the mechanics once you get over the initial 'wow that's new' factor. randomness is huge, and everytime I am left with the feeling the actual flight is the part when only person who finished first plays in, the rest (or at least me) just wait bored and irritated. the expansions change nothing if you dislike the game

Initial Impression: This is a fun, chaotic tile-laying game. I particularly enjoy the quick decisions you must make when building your ship. The second phase of the game is fairly interesting in that you get to see all the design mistakes you made. There's not alot of player interaction but it's still a fun game.

When I first bought this game, I absolutely loved it. A big part of the enjoyment was the chaos involved in simultaneously building ships and then getting the ships blasted apart. The game has lost some of its appeal because my ships just don't fall apart much anymore. The second phase of game play often seems to drag quite a bit.

Addendum: After enjoying the app, I have discovered one bit of the rules that I have interpreted incorrectly in the past. Using the correct interpretation, as presented by the app, makes this game a little more challenging and fun once again. :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game is different than every other game in my collection.  There is a controlled chaos to the game that makes it a joy to play.  It is a challenge to develop a strategy for building your ship while operating under duress: racing for the best pieces and racing against the timer.  It is interesting when another player builds a small efficient ship rather than a large ship and flips the timer to squeeze all of the other players.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of my all-time favourites. The goofy theme, the demanding skill requirements, the hilarity as everything falls apart, the game is a lot of fun all the way through. However, I would not necessarily recommend it to everyone. This is a game that can be heavily influenced by luck, which can make you feel like all your hard-won strategies and planning were all for naught. Personally, I find this game fun no matter who gets hit with all the bad stuff; as long as somebody's plans are a mess, the game is full of laughs, since I am happy to laugh at myself. Second, this game has a very heavy skill component; you need to practice building your ship a few times before you get particularly good. This makes it a lousy game for beginners, or people who need a constant success ratio, or people who don't want to suffer through a learning curve.

When I read about this, it didn't sound too great.  I'm not overly fond of games with timers.  But I have to admit, I really enjoy this.  It's one of those games that are just fun to play.  There's nothing quite like the feeling of launching your ship only to find out that 1/3 of it fell off at launch because you designed it poorly.  [I've had to raise my rating from a 7 to an 8, and it may go higher than that.  This game is just hilarious.  Even after six plays it I am still laughing so hard my head hurts.]

Galaxy Trucker uses a unique tile placement race mechanic that allows players to each build their own unique space ship.  Players then test their space ship against a random mix of cards.

Some of the funniest gaming experiences I have had have involved this game.  It is extremely funny when one of two people lose half of thier ships due to dangerous flying conditions.  I have also have some very mediocure games when playing with individuals who get irritated when one person attempts to speed up building ships to other players disadvantage.  My enjoyment with this game really depends upon the group.  For this reason, it is not played quite as often as I would like, but I would have not to have it aroudn when the right group sits down for a game night.

Really like this game. A lot of fun, really unique and goofy. Each player attempts to building a working space ship from tiles that are spread out in the middle of the table. Each player is racing to complete there ship first, after which all of the ships are sent on an intergalactic shipping route where all sorts of bad things happen. Very fun game that is very goofy. Your ship will blow up and you will die, but it is so fun and goofy that it is in no way frustrating.

This really seems to be a love it or hate it game. I certainly love it. The tension and the challenge during the building phase is brilliant. First players tend to forgo the look at the cards but to me this seems key to building a good ship. During the flying phase the game is just pure fun as you're watching the beginner ships disintegrating all around you. Needs some additional challenge when you get to know the game. This is provided by the big expansion.

For a somewhat complex game, this is a lot of comedic fun. That's a rare feat. I really enjoy the building of the ship, only to see if it can successfully withstand all that the forces of chaos can hurl at it.

Components - strategy of engines (race points) vs cannons (enemies points) vs cargo (goods points) vs flexibility of batteries/shields/green cans&engs vs crew

quality smooth ship building - exposed connectors invite damage and no opportunity for gain

A strange mish-mash of game styles.  The first part of each round is very involving as players are focused on assembling a really good quality ship.  The second part of each round is very light and silly as players watch their carefully crafted ships get blown to smithereens by random dice rolling.  I'm just not that fond of the blending of these 2 unique styles.  I'd be willing to play again, but I won't actively seek out a game.

RATING: 7
Fun but difficult at first go.  I would suggest playing just 1 and 2 ships for a first game.  There is a lot to keep track of, a lot to learn very quickly.  Drawing the tiles can be hectic, especially with more players.

This is a game where you are playing against the game as much/more than against the other players - something I like and would like to see more of.

Brutal - but it can be a real pleasure to watch *someone else's* ship be destroyed.

Such an amazingly unique design, like most things Vlaada. It's just really fun. Playing the iPhone app made me truly fall in love with the game. It takes quite a bit of play to truly enjoy the game I think, although newbies can still find it fun. But it definitely rewards familiarity and experience. The theme is completely original and hilarious. There is not a ton of interaction among players, but opponents are certainly a factor when considering how to best prepare one's ship for the race half of each round and whether to land on a planet or keep first dibs on upcoming cards, whether to use energy on double guns and engines, etc. There is some luck, but skill will win the day.

Having played Space Alert a few times, I knew the chaos and fun I was in for with Galaxy Trucker.  It came through and, of course, it was fun.  There were three of us and two of us were new to the game.  The one who'd played before took huge handicaps from the expansion and still demolished us newbies.  We also missed an invalid part of my ship in round 3 until it was halfway through which probably messed up the scoring for 2nd and 3rd.  Still, it was a good time.

At first it's quite fun to build your ship and watch it get destroyed. However, once you figure out how to build an effective ship, and once you know what the cards have in store, it becomes possible to just dominate everything. This game needed to be a little more difficult to keep my 10 rating.

RATING: 8
A ridiculous and fun game! The ship-building phase is a great, frantic puzzle and only improves with more players. Then, the travel phase is a great litmus test for how poorly everyone did! I really like that the travel phase does horrible things, but does them to everybody. Because of this nobody ever takes it too hard when their ship falls in half, or worse. Usually everyone is just laughing.

This is just a pile of fun.  Lots of luck involved, but it's delightful to see your ship come together and then start to disintegrate.  Has a bit of a simcity/civ feel - you build it up then test how well it stands.  Love it.

Kind of surprising that this is so popular around here given all the chaos and randomness it entails.  Maybe there's hope for the sheeple yet.

Smashing - frantic and lots of fun. A little forward planning pays off but so do quick reactions AND the ability to think and plan under pressure. A really great mixture of speed and thinking. Like nothing else I have played to date. Deserves all the praise it gets.

Oh, but be prepared to have your ship blown apart from under you by events beyond your control. Sometimes even the best planning can't avoid that, and to be honest the destruction derby feel is half the fun.

Galaxy Trucker 7>6
Had the author dared just a little more, Galaxy Trucker would have been a great game rather than the moderately fun hybrid it is: it looks like he tried and threw a stone, then had second thoughts and hid his hand before others could spot him.

What I mean is, there’s lovely chaos all over the board when players scavenge the pieces they need to build their ships but, as the worst euro fashion requires, as soon as you’ve put down a piece on your board you may no longer move it. This is so frustrating that it both prevents any fun and makes the journey through space shine, even though there’s no way to directly mess with the other players.

But it’s one of the few science-fiction themed games my eurogaming friends are likely to play, so I have to make it do. [i](November 2012)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - No doubt I’ve overrated Galaxy Trucker: thus I took advantage of my Fall 2015 rating revise to adjust my rating slightly according to the comment above, lowering an excessive 7 to a better fitting 6 until I’ll have the chance to play and rate this game again.

From the description of the game and some of the comments I've read, I thought this game would not be well received by me. Got that wrong. Both the ship building and ship destruction is a blast (more so with the latter). Fun, fun, fun!

Update: After repeated plays, I find that I don't much care for playing the game as instructed. It feels more like I'm playing the game three times instead of one; something I wouldn't do with the best of games.

This game was really fun. And I say that after having had no idea what the heck I was doing in my first game (not much of the game was explained to me). There's a huge learning curve, but even though I got killed (in the third round), it was still really fun. I can see one of my groups really liking this game as a longer filler. It's not worth it if you're only going to play infrequently, though; you really need to know what kinds of obstacles you're going to run into. It's not as much fun when you're just sitting there watching everyone else play.

Oh, man, this is a good one. Its a game you can really try at, and be better than someone else, but in the end, you have to go along for the ride.

Decent puzzle game.  Fun to build a ship and hope she holds together in space.  Not sure if it has legs to play on a regular basis.  But perhaps the speed pressure can add to that as the better you get the faster you go.  We were fairly leisurely in our building.  But it's easy enough to get people to jump right in.  

Jan 2017 - finally played it a second time.  Not sure why I dropped to a 5, but I pushed it up to an 8 (overreaction perhaps)?  I really enjoyed the game and it was super fun to fly your ship and hope it holds together.  Yah, it's an 8 now, I want to play again, soon, with max players.

RATING: 8.5
Vlaada Chvatil at his most crazy--which is a) very crazy, and b) a great, great thing. The basic concept, the humor in the rulebook, the graphic design would all make this game a winner even if the game itself were just ok, but the game is both unlike anything else out there on the market, and surprisingly engaging given that, after ship construction, you're just flipping cards over and resolving effects. Toss in the coolness factor of building your own ship, and this is a game which is surprisingly easy to introduce to new players.

RATING: 5
Clever game of racing the clock to build the most efficient ship for salvaging and mining missions in space. Slight drawback to the game is that that players replaying the same set may learn the imperfections on the backs of the chits (paper tear, nicks, etc.) and have an unfair advantage over inexperienced players or those new to the set. However, there is a neat "story-telling" narrative that this game has that most euros don't: you can tell other players "what happened" when the game is over. There is point of diminishing returns on replayability as there is a bit of repetition of events on journeys--the later ones simply take longer to finish. A friend commented that the system could be used as a vehicle for role-playing or licensed for sci-fi franchises

It's lots of fun to race the other players for parts and build the best ship you can.  The second part of the game is just brutal though.  Ships getting destroyed all over the place.  Need to play more to figure that part of it out.

RATING: 6.5
Good but not great game in the real-time genre.  I like it in small doses.  For me the game runs a bit on the long side for the amount of fun that I get out of it.  Also, as twisted as it sounds, I would prefer to use the "Enterprise" (IIIA) ship in every game because it's fun and challenging.  The game plays differently with 3 versus 4 players because there is often a scarcity of useful pieces in the 4 player game.

Personal goal:  I need to focus less on perfection and more on speed in the 3rd round.  A crappy ship in the final round can drop you from 1st place to last quite easily.

Others say:  some skill & good amount of randomness/luck, build a ship then use/abuse it for profit, a heavier beer & pretzels game.

A really silly (and hence fun) game of spaceship building and goods transporting, with threats of asteroids, pirates and so on, which tend to knock bits off your badly constructed spaceship.

Loads of fun! Plenty of interesting decisions during the shipbuilding phase (more guns or engines? Do I have enough batteries?

Okay, this one has been a hit with the family. I really enjoy putting the spaceship together and watching it get beat up in the event cards, although the times you lose because you run out of crew is kind of annoying and seemed far more common. Played with two and four - I've seen comments elsewhere that it's not as good with two, but we've really enjoyed it. Four player is fun though, as it really puts a crimp in how many tiles you get to build your ship with.

RATING: 8
Chaotic fun in about an hour.  Build your ship then brave the galaxy in a race fraught with peril!  Seems the most fun when your ship is getting pounded to scrap and being the victim of unlikely events.  Quite light overall and not a game for people that will take the battering of their ship personally.

More plays in I still enjoy this game quite a lot.  We're getting better at building the ships, so they're taking less damage during the flights, and that tends to leech some of the joy out of this game.  It does not happen all of the time, and we still have people end up flying a small scrap of what they started with from time to time.  I'll pick up the Big Expansion soon, for the nastier event cards, 5th player and new ship components.

Really fun game that invovles throwing together a hastily built starship and then running a mission through space.

On your trip you can face various sorts of events that allow you to gather things-face aliens-run into meteor fields etc.

Dependings on how you built your ship you will see it fall to pieces right in front of you.

This is a game that makes me laugh regardless.

The only mechanic I am trying to wrap my head around is the tile choosing mechanic in your "shipbuild."

I wish that some tiels had dual useage vs simply one as I think it would tighten up the planning phase when doing your build.  Say that some engines could also be guns or maybe one or the other.

What this would create is a part of a ship that could be more quickly assembled knowing that a player might be able to use it to bridge to other pieces more successfuly.

This would be a great idea for an expansion possibly.  Just throwing in about 10-18 more tiles with more dimension.

Otro gran juego del Vlaada Chatil de Dungeon Lords, TtA y otras tantas glorias. El juego consta de tres rondas cada una de ellas con dos fases. La primera es muy divertida y consiste en ir construyendo una nave espacial con losetas (cada loseta otorga ciertas características a la nave) y la segunda consiste en utilizar esa nave que has creado en una carrera espacial, haciendo frente a los eventos que vayan sucediendo. Las rondas van creciendo en complejidad, tanto por el tamaño de la nave, como los eventos que te van ocurriendo. La tercera ronda es una locura. 

Juego muy divertido y totalmente recomendable.

This is a cute game with lots of bits that's all about getting the best product out in the shortest period of time, and balancing 'best' with 'time'.

The first game is generally chaotic as no-one knows what to expect. As people get better at ship building, the game progresses nicely.

Still somewhat unsure about some of the 'how to use the timer when building' mechanics.

I orderedthe expansion because the game was out of stock, and they sent me the game and not the expansion by mistake.

Played it several times now. Very chaotic game with a random factor thats make a potential winner ending last with just an asteroid hit.
Very high playability in the game.
As you can very easy add new ship types and print the free stuff that are on BGG.

Half of this game is really awesome! The race to build your ships and to do it well enough to survive is a really great aspect of this game. The other half of the game (once you are able to build decent ships) really starts to fizzle, and takes a tad too long. Fun game, but not my fave.

RATING: 8
Rating based on one play.  Seems entertaining enough with speedy players.  I'd hate to play it with AP types, though, without some sort of time on the ship-building part.  Would like to try it again soon and would consider buying it if I still enjoy it after a couple more plays.

UPDATE:  Increasing rating from 7.5 to 8 after several more plays.

RATING: 9
Love this game. I like everything from the frenetic tile-flipping and puzzle-like aspect of ship building, to strategy of putting together a competent hauler (going for speed? weapons? alien passengers? a little of all?), to deciding how to use the limited energy and abilities of your ship once actually in-flight.

We played this as a focus game at EBGL and I haven't written this review until almost a year removed, but I find myself thinking of this game on a semi-regular basis. One or two more plays to cement that it is as good as I remember, and I may bump this to a 9.

Update 11/09/2015: the more I play this game, the more I find additional strategies in the Adventure phase. Bumping to a 9.

My take on this game - it is a blast. It offers a challenge with the timer, which (mercifully) limits the building phase. Got to know what you are doing or your ship will be not be as effective as you might need it for the various trials encountered for the pick up and delivery of the goods. Some players are put off by the timer, but it makes sense to keep ships from being 'perfect' and discourages slow-pokes from dragging the game. The game plays best with three players, since there are more parts avaiable from the warehouse. This balances out the rushed time limit allowed for building. With four players, certain parts become taken too quickly, resulting in weaker ship constructions and thus fewer players making it to the end of the run with cargo. However, with some players, part of the fun is watching ships disintegrate, so it depends on the crowd.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
If I was fifteen, I would probably enjoy this game a whole lot more. Having said that, I really enjoy this game now. The building component is frenetic, and the traveling through space watching your ship deteriorate is just silly fun. Take the humorous rulebook to heart and just enjoy the game for the fun and not so much for the strategy.

Recently played this again, and was surprised as I liked it more than I remembered. It certainly is a gong show, and I don't love the random gauntlet of attacks on your ship honestly, I wish there was a better way to challenge you and damage your ship, but the rest of the game is quite fun and the other mechanisms interlock very well together. And it's paced quite well! A brisk, raucous experience.

In Galaxy Trucker you build your ship then race it. It's a bit like going to a junkyard, assembling a kludged together vehicle and starting a delivery service. A lot of the entertainment in this comes from building your ship then watching it fall apart so don't get to attached to your ships.

A classic. Construct your ships out of random parts and prepare for a space adventure. Either riches or failure awaits you in the space lanes as your try to pilot your hastily bolted together ships to their destination avoiding pirates, plagues, asteroid storms on the way and picking up whatever trade goods you can find. I'm not very good at this game, I always struggle to make all the parts I pick at the start line up correctly. Even so it's fun to watch my shoddy ship either fall apart or escape through more luck than skill and limp over the finish line.

This game has been on my radar for a long time. Several months ago my FLGS finally got a few copies in and I was able to snag one of them. Unfortunatly the game has sat on a shelf since then...

On 5/14/2013 I actually got around to playing it with my Tuesday night group. The short of it is that the game was a huge hit and will be a regular in the rotation for awhile. We actually played two games of this. The first time we only played one round and used the bigginer rules in the rulebook. I highly recommend reading the rulebook out loud to the group, it's pretty funny. The second time we played, we played a full game.

Going into the game with the expectation that nothing will work and you're going to lose horribly is the best way to have fun with Galaxy Trucker. If you're the kind of person that needs to have everything planned out methodically and gets frustrated when well-laid plans go bad, then it's probably not the game for you. 

That said, I've been enjoying the hell out of this game. Brilliant, silly fun.

RATING: 6
Very fun, wacky game. All of the ship tiles give really interesting powers and combinations, and the expansions are an absolute must have. You have to go into the game with a sense of humor, though, because you will get screwed repeatedly and probably won't be able to do anything about it. Eurogamers beware.

My only complaint is that to do well you have to spend some time carefully putting together your ship, which actually gets a little boring if everyone else is also going slowly. If you want to make the game more fun, fast, and hilarious, you can try to build your ship quickly, but the results will be disastrous during the race. The end result is either a boring first half, or a miserable and disappointing second half.

A nice "breath of fresh air" in board games.  I really enjoy the "race to build the best ship you can" phase of the game.  Unfortunately some people have a hard time doing it, and so this game will not appeal to everyone.  It is fun making decisions around taking the time to find the "perfect" piece vs. using a less ideal piece in order to put time pressure on your opponents.

RATING: 8
One of those games which is simply fun - no doubt experience will help with completing the first stage shipbuiding task under the time pressure but for the second stage you pretty much just have to sit back and laugh as your puny spaceships are smashed to bits by irresistable galactic forces.  Great fun - the comparisons to factory fun and space dealer comes from the need to build your spaceship from the common stock of components - you turn over a tile then either play it on your board or put it in the common area where anyone can take it - and the fact that the first person finished not only gets a bonus but turns over a timer which puts a limit on how long the others have to finish.  Then the real fun part is heading off into space to see how well built your ship is - i.e. how well it stands up to meteor storms and space pirates etc. - that is when large chunks start to float off - to hoots of laughter from your opponents - there are other ways to score on the voyage but the main score comes at the end for finishing positions, any cargo you've picked up and a bonus for the best built ship - or rather best remaining bit of the ships that started - then pay for your repairs and head off on voyages 2 & 3 - on increasingly bigger ships.  Very different games but slightly reminiscent of Railway Rivals in that the first part of the game is spent building your railway/spaceship and the second is spent testing how well it stands up to the demands of space travel.  And in both games the dice can occassionally be cruel to you no matter how well you built in stage one - to the delight of your opponents.

Galaxy Trucker is a good party game: despite other similar games (Munchkin for the aesthetics, Carcassonne for tile management), it offers an optical gameplay where is possible to apply a strategy. Spaceship building is maybe the more fun part of the game, while exploration is actually a necessity to assign points ti the players.

RATING: 9
Had a lot of fun with this one. Build your ship up, Factory Fun style, then watch as it gets blown to pieces trying to get to the outer rim. Although the two games aren't remincient at all, it reminds me of Duel in the Dark: both are two-phase games (planning then execution), and both have just enough game in both parts to be fun but not to go overboard. The building of your "truck" is where most of the fun is, as you get an inkling of the upcoming hazards and make choices about how to outfit your ship. The actual run then is mostly decision-free, but there is *just* enough there to keep the players engaged, it moves quickly enough to be fun, and it succeeds at being very thematic and entertaining.

The one possible problem I noticed was that going first can be a big deal. Getting the first crack at beneficial encounters can make a huge difference, or can allow you to fairly cheaply hose the other players. So the game might reward speed a little bit more than you might like. But I'm not sure yet. If it is an issue, it's an issue for replayability; out of the box, the game is great fun.

This one is a lot of fun!  Rush to build your ships in a kind of puzzly affair, and then hope they survive the dangers that space throws at them.  Thankfully, you can preview the road ahead and try to build your ship accordingly.  While the ship building itself is a fun exercise, half the fun is laughing at all the screwed up ships and watching as chunks of them get taken off by meteors during the perilous flight phase.

Fun, fast paced game. Build a space ship out of spare parts and send it trucking through the reaches of space, hopefully picking up cargo and profits along the way, but most likely getting hilariously blown to pieces. Brilliantly lacking in downtime since everyone is playing at the same time during the build phase and most of the adventure phase events effect all players.

RATING: 5
This is a very enjoyable group game (and one my wife just loves).  I'd really like to see how this plays with others and how it holds up over repeat plays.  Our group seemed to have decided that being first to finish was less important than having a complete ship, which I think undermined the chaos of the building stage a touch.  Given that quite a few of our missions ended with people being forced to give up, maybe we needed still more time.  The mission cards didn't seem to add a lot (that is, most of the fun was in the building), and the decisions of whether to stop at this or that planet were usually obvious.  

I think this game fills an important place in a gamer's collection.  It's not exactly a "filler", but its a wonderful change-of-pace game to wedge between say, the brain-burn of Agricola and the competitive nastiness of Brass.  It's almost like a party game that's actually...you know...a game.

Another really unique game from Vlaada. Players build a spaceship in real-time before flying it in space and trying to survive. I really like the variability the game has through the building phase and the shuffled card deck creating the obstacles for each round. Be warned though, the game is very random which may turn off some gamers and it could be a bit heartbreaking to see your ship crumble to pieces after spending so much time building it. Definitely a good game, but not the type that I'd want to play every day.

This game absolutely oozes theme. The real-time scramble for building your spaceship gives everyone lots to do and is simply plain fun at the table. 

Sure, more experienced players have a significant edge here, but since the whole activity is so entertaining, I think one's enjoyment of the game is far less dependent on one's own fortunes than with most other games. In that it feels very much like a party game. It's that sorta lively atmosphere at the table.

For a jaded eurogamer like me it's a bliss to discover something so fresh, fun and original. It's a blast and a design I very much admire.

With The Big Expansion and Another Big Expansion

This game is so phenomenal. I first got introduced to it on the app, and loved it. So I ordered the cardboard version. I expected it to be rowdy and crazy while grabbing tiles from the central pile at the same time, and sort of tense during the journey. I turned out to be completely wrong. People are so focused during the building, it's hilarious. And during the journey, everyone finally is so relieved to be done building, they just sit back and laugh at every misfortune that happens. Vlaada, you just keep knocking it out of the park- yet to try a game of his I don't adore. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
There's definitely a skill to building your ship well, and it helps if you know the cards (due to play experience, not by looking through the stacks).

Building a nice ship is fun. A fun little logic problem trying to get your pieces to fit together well and be effective (with whatever you believe to be an effective combination). 

And then the testing phase is a wild funny ride that has just enough decisions to keep me engaged.

RATING: 7
You really have to be down to play a game where all of your best-laid plans can blow up - literally - to enjoy this.

This is a game in which you try to account for every possible outcome (which you likely cannot do, because you're under time pressure and competing with everyone else for parts), and then see how well you did. If that does not sound fun to you then there is no way you will enjoy this game. If you can just let go and enjoy the experience, though... if you can just laugh hysterically at the fact that you just plain forgot to put in enough power stations to power your lasers because you were so focused on getting the damn lasers in the first place and then laugh EVEN MORE when your ship gets obliterated by an asteroid, then this is a whole barrel of chaotic fun.

I suppose the best thing I can say about this game is it captures how fun "frantic" can be. How racing against your friends in real time and constantly worrying that they're going to get all the best ship parts, or that you'll forget something, or a GIGANTIC ASTEROID IS GOING TO OBLITERATE YOU is actually fun. Honestly, I think I only enjoy this game more over time as the meta game of trying to build The Ultimate Ship every time I play and thinking about how I fared last time vs. this time becomes my main concern.

Build your own space ship!!! Theeeen watch it burn and contort into hideous wreckage. If you can laugh at yourself (and others) this deceptively casual, fun game is worth your time. Barrier for entry is not low, but not very high either. Unique and still going strong.

I have to consider this a tentative rating, since I have only played without the timers, and it seems that would be essential to the fun. The part of the game where the stuff happens to your ship is just not very fun for me. Factory Fun is definitely a more pure puzzle game, and I prefer the factory theme to the spaceship one.

Kinda fun. Also kinda takes a long time. Kinda don't get many requests for another game. I guess alot of people found this a breath of fresh air amongst more serious strategy games...I'll probably rather just play a more serious strategy game.

[u]May 2009:[/u] An odd game in my collection. I took a long time before taking the plunge, hating all things related to randmness and dice. However, the game did seem fun and I thought it might not bother me in this game. I was right. I only played it with my girlfriend as of yet (2p then) and it was a great deal of fun. And it is true that even watching its own ship getting destroyed is really fun, even for very competitive player such as Laurène and I (playing games is the only moment when we argue!).
Moreover, the game is beautiful with the green translucid beads for batteries, little tic-tac looking astronauts. The design of the tiles are very nice too. The cards seem a bit flimsy but nothing really problematic. A beautiful and very fun game though.

I'd have 2 minor complaints though.
First, I regret that you start from scracth from on round to another. I can understand that this is a design choice to prevent the game from being over at the first round. You can always make up in the next ones, since what you did in the first one doesn't matter anymore. However, it feels a little bit as if you're playing 3 different little games in a row. Not a big problem of course.
Secondly, once the ships are built and the adventure begins, there aren't a lot of decision making and it feels a bit anti-climatic.

All in all though, this is a great game that I'd recommend to anyone wanting a fun game with a little bit of strategy (the strategy relies on how you'll build your ship, how much firepower, how many astronauts, how many containers and of what type... You don't have the place to do everything perfect so you have to make some choices) and I'm excited to get the expansion! Specially since it apparently solves my second minor issue.

RATING: 8.5
This game is awesome! My wife loves it too, though it’s not a very good game with just 2 players – but it’s great with 3 and 4 players as they add a lot of tension and pressure to finish first (as, in this game, if you have built a decent ship, being first or second is absolutely crucial if you want to win). Everybody knows that, so it’s a race to finish ahead of the others, but when you’re building so fast, the chances are that you will miss something and make some errors which will later on most likely be devastating for your ship – great fun! That’s also why you shouldn’t take this game too seriously; it’s not all about winning but only about having fun (yes yes, I know, that’s how every game is like, but I feel Galaxy Trucker has a very different vibe than, say, most eurogames; these cannot be said to be “funny”, but rather very thinky, and the best player often win in these).

You can remove pieces when playing with 2 and 3 players, but I don’t fancy that as you might remove a lot of the same type of pieces. Still, it’s the best possible solution, but I think I would always prefer to play GT with 4 or maybe 3.

I don’t know how, but I’ve won every game of GT I’ve played; that’s because I often build a pretty good ship and often finish first or second; in case I don’t it’s because other players have rushed and built some ships that are bound to be crushed later on! I often take a peek at the 3 deck of cards as they help you shape your building strategy for your ship; this helps mitigating the randomness of the events, but I think it’s great that you add some cards every round that you cannot look at – in order to ensure that there is some randomness which can ruin your carefully laid out plans! It’s always a great deal of fun when your own or another player’s ship loses half of its side due to a meteor… After I played GT I knew that I had to own it, so I got the Anniversary Edition – I can’t wait to try the expansions! I’ve actually already included the Even-Steven cards as I want to handicap myself; as I said, this game is all about having fun and not about winning, so I feel like it’s more fair if I’m handicapped in each game (and it really does mitigate the advantage of more experienced players).

All in all Galaxy Trucker is a great game, and I must say that I admire the ability of designer Chvatil to constantly make games that feel so different (not that I love all of his designs; GT is definitely his best in my opinion). One minor complaint I have about GT is the timer; it’s too slow, and I’ve considered playing with a stop watch and set it to e.g. 2 minutes – THAT would make the game stressful and tense! The fact that I’ve played GT 6 times during the first month really says a lot as I often play a new game only once or maybe twice during that first month.

Fun game, but for my taste too tame in the flight phase. Destruction or heavy losses are rarely an issue, thus it just comes down to counting different items. Occasionally fun.

Immensely entertaining right from the beginning. Really appreciate the tension and competitiveness of the shipbuilding round. 

Holding up to be a great game everytime it comes out of the box. Because you get better at the game as you play more, the expansion keeps the game alive with its comical brutality.

My younger son is able to play this at age five.  He sometimes needs a little help getting the connections right, and somebody else needs to process the event cards, but he can build a ship with the best of them.  In our last game, he won by absolutely crushing us the final round, getting cannons, batteries, and red aliens galore and blasting all of the pirates, smugglers, and slavers in sight.  That kept him in the back of the turn order (because to defeat them takes a few flight days), so that everybody else kept having trouble with them before he would blow them out of the galaxy and reap the rewards.  Since then, he's declared this to be his favorite game.

Pretty cool game.  I like the "speed" aspect at the beginning of each round where one is trying to build the ship with whatever is available.  A veritable free-for-all orgy of fun.

Some of the action cards can get a little out of hand.  A bad roll can litteraly wipe out half your ship with one big meteor, and then the rest of the round you have to sit and watch because you don't have any more engines because of that said bad roll.

But overall, it is a lot of fun.  The excessively high price is kind of annoying, but I managed to get around that and buy the game for myself anyway.

I say the first half of each of the three rounds are great for those who love puzzles . . . the rush to get your ship set up before others seems to use their skills.  The ships later traveling creates a situation where all players share the threats of the trip.

Galaxy Trucker is very fun, even if it isn't the type of game I normally play.  Assembling the space ship under time constraints was actually challenging and entertaining, and revealing the cards afterwards was both comical and tense.

This game should just be renamed to "How Many Rapes Can I Survive?".  There seems to be no point in randomly grabbing tiles and building your ship.  Half of it is not legal, and you're guaranteed to get p00ned by pretty much all of the cards.

I'm not familiar with all of Vlaada's work, but between Galaxy Trucker and Space Alert, I admire a game designer that can imagine such unique games. Galaxy Trucker is an odd game, with simultaneous tile grabbing and laying to build up your ship, followed by a destructive phase where that precious ship you built gets pummeled by meteors, space pirates, and all other sorts of nastiness. 

Galaxy Trucker is just a bit too complicated for family gaming, yet the die rolling and chaos/destruction is too random for "serious" gamers. For me, though, the game is just flat-out fun. There's enough planning and decision making to keep it interesting, and the build/destroy dynamic generates plenty of laughs with the right crowd. It's a party game for gamers!

If one of my goals is to fill my collection with unique games (which I think it is), then Galaxy Trucker will always have a place in my collection.

[b]Thoughts? - [/b]A brilliant game that is uniquely different to almost every other game I play.  You build your ship at speed against your friends, and then fly it through a number of challenges to see what bits fall off.  Superb fun if everyone is up for the challenge and like pulling teeth if they aren't.  Play with 3 or 4 on the base game and enjoy!

This is primarily an experience game rather than any sort of deep strategy game.  Most of the game consists of building a well constructed ship, which somewhat relies on the luck of which tiles you flip.  Certainly, there are some clever decisions you can make, but they can be torn apart by bad luck.  Given that, I prefer to play the "shorter" game with round 2 and round 3 ships, foregoing round 1.  I realize that does increase the luck a little bit more, as there is less time to recover - but I think this game wants to be shorter than it is.

After all of that, this is a fun game to play.  Watching everyone's ship get blown apart is pretty funny... and building ships is just plain fun.  I could see this game wearing out its welcome, but I think it's worth the price of entry.

2008 Christmas gift from Seth and Nikki! Simply a unique and fantastic game. The real-time ship building is such a rush. I am not a fan of putting together puzzles, but I could put together ship components to make spaceships all day long. It is chaotic, but you have more control than you think. 

The resolution round is fun too. Getting to watch how each ship handles the journey can be very amusing. Everyone I have played with has had a great time no matter what the outcome. I have never played a game that gets everyone laughing and smiling so much. The game is best with more players.

Needs balancing by keeping the gaps between players one in all rounds not just the first, otherwise the fastest player will just always win

Combination of a speed game reminiscent of Factory Fun, followed by a fun flavourful element of travelling through space.

Doesn't really get me, the fast element is OK, and the space travel is OK, but usually the person who starts doing badly just gets hit more.

EDIT: If you make the gap between players finishing one space regardless of round this is a lot better

What a ridiculous thing this is. You build a spaceship, you send it across the galaxy, and nine times out of ten it blows up. I don't know why, but even though I develop tiny personal attachments to the ships I build, I'm never that upset when they fall to pieces. It's always just too funny to get mad over.

But the clever thing about this game is that it's not just the random nonsense it initially seems to be. You can get better at it. You start to prioritize specific pieces when building your ship. You realize that being in first isn't always the best thing to do. You develop different strategies for making money. Do you want to build a gargantuan ship that can hold a lot of cargo, at the risk of being more exposed to the elements? Do you want to build a svelte ship with a focus on weapons and engines and simply destroy everything you come across? Something in-between?

I think more variety in tiles will eventually be welcome, so I'll probably pick up one of the expansions at some point.

After living in Paris for about a year I was finally able to round up 4-5 guys to play games about once/month. These guys ranged in age from 25-65 and were all inquisitive in nature. They were light hearted, good natured, and looked for the best in people. They are what I call 'salty' people. We had a good time playing games such as Catan and Railroad Tycoon. Then I bought and introduced Galaxy Trucker to the mix, and we had an excellent time. From that day forward that was the only game we played. Good times and fond memories.

Fast forward a year and I am living on a French compound in Nigeria. Seeing that my French sucks I naturally gravitated towards the other non-french speaking person on the compound. I am quite sure that we would not be friends otherwise as we have radically different personalities, but he was my neighbor and he was english. In fact he even challenged me to a game of Trivial Pursuit because he wanted to prove that he was smarter (what??). I declined because I do not enjoy that game with people I enjoy hanging out with - I could only imagine what it would be like with him! But instead I brought out Galaxy Trucker and told him my buddies and I loved it and I was dying to play again. So, after a long hiatus Galaxy Trucker was back on the table!

Fast forward to mid-second round and he looks at me and says, "I know why you and your buddies like this game. Only a 14 year old boy would find this game amusing." I looked at him and said, "game over" and swept my arm across the table. That was the day I started to learn French.

What is to be learned from this tale? Don't play this game with people you cannot have a good time with to begin with and don't buy this game if that is the case-you will hate it. If you (or your inner child) like to build stuff (and more importantly see it destroyed) and like to be silly on a Friday night - buy this game immediately.

Why this game is better with more?
1. With more people, the tiles to build the space ship become more scarce. So you can't (or it is harder to) build a perfectly clean ship. This can make even a small meteor shower devastating.
2. With more people someone is more likely to get totally destroyed. That is when the game becomes really fun.

Awesome theme! Great components, and a fun rulebook. 

The first portion, where you build your ship, is fun...and the time pressure is usually not a big deal. Its mostly a mechanism for not allowing one player to keep the whole table waiting forever, in their indecision.

I love watching the event deck be revealed and see how my ship holds up. Ultimately, the way the scores come out feels like it may not have a huge deal to do with skill...but the narrative that's created really makes the game shine. There is no game I can think of that fills this niche. Galaxy Trucker is truly unique and a fun original design.

This game gets an 8 based purely on fun factor. The strategies beyond building are a little thin, and the adventure portion is a letdown after the awesomely fun building phase. Still, the building is so fun and the adventure interesting enough that I will play this many many times I'm sure.

RATING: 6
Galaxy Trucker is a weird game to rate...I think, in terms of experience, this is amusing to play, but in terms of the actual game, I find it rather random, and I don't think much of the puzzle aspects. Note that I rate this game as being significantly better with the Rough Road expansion, it increases my enjoyment of the game significantly because it insures that ship will take some damage, sometimes...a lot of damage.

The real quick and dirty on this is that you are building a ship and then racing through the galaxy, trying to pick up trade goods. The ships are built on a board, and are puzzley aka: Factory Fun. The building is less structured than Factory Fun though in that there is a large pool of tiles, and you just freely pick them up, and try to add them to your ship. Components in this case are things like pods for your astronauts, lasers, engines, shields, power cells, and the like. This part of the game I find amusing only in that the finished ship is often ridiculous looking with things like engines hooked onto the side of lasers.

After the ships are built, then players head out and face a random deck of encounters where things like smugglers and meteor storms are encountered. All of this is quite random not only in what you encounter but what happens. For instance, meteors come from a certain direction based on the card, but then dice are rolled to see what specific part of the ship they try to run into, and this is huge in terms of what happens to your ship. The goal of the race is to survive and/or be in the front of the pack, and preferably to pick up a few trade goods along the way.

As I mentioned in the opening, in terms of a game, there just isn't much here to talk about. I find the racing part extremely amusing...for instance, in the first race, I didn't build my ship carefully enough, and a meteor hit me such that my ship was literally broken in half, which resulted in raucous laughter on the part of everyone at the table. 

Subsequent plays indicate that some experience makes it much easier to complete the race in one piece, which takes my enjoyment of the game way down. The best solution? Rough Roads combined with Evil Machinations from the Big Expansion, which crank the game back up to the difficulty that I like it at. Also, be sure you have a social group before pulling this out or it'll undoubtedly fall flat, it's not anything close to a serious game, and it's a bit long for its weight.

Party game, quite fun, but no serious gaming included. The ship design is totaly chaotic and in the mission you are just a passenger who throws 2 dice now and then

I'm not a big fan of real time games.  The rush to draw and place doesn't really make for an interesting contest... and when you throw on top of that the total chaos and needless complexity of the actual race portion of the game, the whole thing was a turnoff for me.  I struggle to comprehend what others see in this one...

Likes: It's a real-time spaceship building game! The art and theme are both awesome. Even the rulebook is a fun read. I have never seen a game implemented in this way.

Dislikes: Not everyone likes the real-time nature of this game and there is a slight learning curve.

If I want to play a tile laying game, this is the one I'm going to pick. Fast, furious and fun building phase followed by a hilarious phase of watching your creation get blown to bits.

The real-time ship building mechanic here is the main draw. Build up, go out into space and hope you don't get blasted to bits.

I love the 'focus on the problem you have' rather than going for an overall strategy from the get go.

Only negative is that the game is punishing if you have never played before. It is best if you are playing with people who have the same skill level as you, as your skill vs other players' skill makes a big difference.

Great game!
The components are top quality and have a lot of charisma. It combines the silent frantic intensity of ship building with the rewarding / comically tragic outcomes of the space flight. It also has the most enjoyable and funny rules I have ever seen. 
It has problems with the level of experience of gamers. New players are completely slaughtered most of the time and though it is in a funny way it still can be frustrating for them and for experienced gamers wanting a close game.


After not playing for a few years the issue of imbalance based on experience is definitely an issue - especially with the expansion.

Quite different to many other games I've played, and a lot of fun. You have to build your spaceship as best as you possibly can balancing, shields, weapons, crew space, cargo space and rocket boosters, all while trying to minimise your ships vulnerability to meteors. Then just watch your ship get pumelled as it flys through space trying to get cargo and money from the various events they occur on each trip.

Someone said that the game is the building of the ships and that the scoring for who did better is the flying of the ships through the obstacle course. Ever since reading that perspective, I've thought the game was neater on a conceptual level and have enjoyed playing it much more. Don't know why that is.

BTW, this has the most entertaining manual of any game in my collection. Very clear too. Superb manual.

Ez a játék, ez zseniális. Először realtime építgetünk egy űrhajót, majd feltöltjük legénységgel meg energiával és kilőjük az űrbe. A játék második felében próbálunk minél több árut és pénzt összegyűjteni és reménykedni, hogy elég erős hajót építettünk ahhoz, hogy túlélje az út viszontagságait. Amikor lőnek ránk, vagy meteoritok jönnek felénk az egy az egyben egy ellen-SettlersOfCatan. Dobsz a két kockával és reméled, hogy azok a gyakori számok jönnek ki, amiken kifejezetten bevétted a hajódat. De tapasztalt Catanosok tudják, hogy a nagy számok törvényének demonstrálásához nagyon sokat kell dobálni, sokkal többet, mint egy-egy játék alatt összejön. Egymás után két 9-es dobás effektíve ketté tud vágni egy picit gyengébbre épített hajót: ha nincs szerencséd megy vele az összes hajtómű is. Fel lehet persze ilyesmire készülni az építés közben, de mindenre nem lehet felkészülni.

We're just getting started with this game which my 8 y.o. loves for the theme (and because you get to build things).  I'm not normally one to enjoy chaos (though once you have kids, you learn to get used to it) so I'm still not quite sure what I think of this game.  Time will tell - overall, I have good impressions of the game.
Play #2 - played the full 3 rounds this time - very enjoyable.  Since I'm playing with my 8 y.o. we allow things to slow down and allow re-configuring of the spaceships.  Now that we're getting the hang of the rules (which are a GREAT read), things are moving along much more smoothly.  Good game - I would have liked to have an experienced player teach it to me, though.

This game gets requested a lot from my various family gaming groups.  Definitely for puzzle lovers.  Building your spaceship, competing with other players for good pieces is quite exciting and fun and constitutes the first half of the game.  This part of each round is one of the finest experiences of gaming pleasure.  But... in comparison the second half of the round is seriously lacking in strategy and interaction and is more of a waiting and watching episode as your ship gets torn apart (especially if you built it poorly).   If the second part had have been more deep and involved, this game would have earned a "10".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Spaceship building fun. Mechanically, I would probably prefer if the speed component were taken out of the building phase, but really, I do like that it dramatically reduces the playtime. Ultimately, I don't really mind losing. It's just fun to build spaceships and race them and watch them get blown apart. The speed component certainly benefits those with experience.

Introductory game with the girlfriend had her exclaiming [i]Oh, I like this better than I thought I would, it's not just about grabbing tiles, but it's also about adding them together semi-intelligently.[/i] Exactly. Why else would I have bought the game...?

After having played about 8 games or so, I conclude that the part grabbing mechanism is nice and works well, and that you get a lot of evocative bits to play with. Unfortunately, this is not a game I'd want to play all the time. There are several reasons for this. [u]First[/u], it all becomes a bit repetitive. There really isn't much variation in what space throws at you, and so the basic requirements your ship should meet are nearly always the same. Lots of guns, lots of engines, lots of cabins, a bit of cargo room, and a few batteries. A shield can be a boon now and then, but that's it, really. Therefore there is no need to be truly creative when building ships, and once you begin to get the hang of it, the only thing holding you back is not finding the components you need on time. [u]Second[/u], although precognition is a very important tactic in this game, there are events which are nigh impossible to plan against. Large meteors and large cannon fire will chip away at your ship (almost) no matter what, so although you can fit your ship with the necessary tools to blast pirates apart and take over abandoned stations, it won't be certain that you actually [i]have[/i] them by the time those cards are turned over. This is a mite annoying, as the payoff for these cards is rather big. [u]Third[/u], there is no direct competition between the players once they are on their way. It is difficult to claw back from a last position, and most of the good stuff will be taken before you can. This forces the building into a bigger gamble than I deem proper: someone who is lucky and builds a slapdash ship might actually survive before someone who constructs a mighty cruiser which can take anything. There should have a been a reward per unit ship flown in as well—after all, this is about supplying stuff to the outer reaches of the Galaxy, not just flying there—to encourage somewhat more thoughtful ship construction. [u]Finally[/u], the game takes too long for what it then, all things considered, becomes. This is unfortunate, but unavoidable.

As a result I'm not really sure how to rate the game. Technically, it's pretty groovy, making use of a rare simultaneous tile grabbing mechanism. And indeed, better players have higher chances of pulling off a journey, but then the burden shifts to your skills in crafting together a ship in record time—is that a good way of setting up a competition between players...? I don't know. I feel there are two sides to Galaxy Trucker: one is novelty and subject, where the game easily reaches an 8, perhaps even a lofty 9. But in terms of gameplay, wellll... I doubt it goes beyond the 5 I've given it. The journey is one of humour as well as a bit of luck, and like all things funny, should be taken in moderation. I like the game, make no mistake, but not sufficiently to play it all the time with its current ruleset.

[b]Update[/b] Bit the bullet and let it go, including all expansions I'd collected. It's really just another Vlaada effort: terribly enticing in theory, flat and not very gamelike in practice.

I really love playing this game. Space is absolutely my favorite theme, and any game that captures that independent freelancer spirit also is worth trying, and on both accounts GT is a hit. This game has excellent components, a fairly easy to read rulebook with just the right amount of depth, and enough replayability to satisfy. After awhile, experienced players will get almost too good at building ships, but the downloadable rough road cards allow those players to take it to the next level. Overall, an excellent game.

I'm still a bit on the fence with this game.  I enjoy the concept, but haven't really [i]enjoyed[/i] the game play.  It may have something to do with my son's not quite grasping the building aspect and my correcting them constantly makes it a bit of a chore.  So if I played it with others who knew what they're doing, it might change my mind.  The fun part about this game is making your spaceships and watching it potentially blow up in front of you as it is bombarded by meteors.  A very rather random game, that is quirky enough to make it fun.

Not unlike Space Alert, this game requires you to frantically plan ahead for circumstances you can't predict.  You try to piece together the best ship you can imagine, and then set course, hoping for the best.  Along the way you'll encounter asteroids, space pirates, and unexplored planets.

If you keep your sense of humor intact, this game is great fun.  I had a lot of fun losing, and that's a good thing.  This is a unique game that would round out any game collection.

Very fun, if a little random game, simultaneous play can be quite frantic as you build your spaceship, then watch it fall to pieces in the 2nd phase!

RATING: 9
A fantastic push your luck game centered on ship building.  Do you sacrifice time to discover what is in the event decks, or attempt to build a solid ship?  All this while attempting to pressure the other players into making ship building mistakes.

Definitely one of my favorite titles.  I always laugh as everyone's ship plunges on through a horrible trial of ordeals and is summerarily torn apart in the process.  You certainly can't take setbacks seriously.

This game truly shines with 4 - 5 players (with the expansion) as valuable tiles are in short supply, forcing everyone to build quickly.  An increase in build speed usually ends up in build errors or weakness in your ship design.  This becomes punishing on the second and third rounds.

I've found that most people I know develop a poor impression of the game if the learning game is not done in a slow manner as to ease people into learning both the rules and ship building stratagies.

Building your ship is great, loved this part of the game. However, the second part of the game is incredibly boring and random. Traded away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
This game is full of truly random elements that can ruin your experience entirely. 

The only interesting part of this game is the ship building phase. I would argue it's the only real part of the game. Although with the time constraint if you fail to make a decent ship kiss it goodbye you will most likely be eliminated by the end of the phase and be in a position that you are not able to win. 

The gimmick of the game lasts a very short amount of time and then you just get frustrated that one card will blow up your whole ship with no way to stop it.

RATING: 7
Frenetic fun. Getting better at shipbuilding is fun at first, but eventually the challenges aren't enough. 

Does not handle disparate play-levels well; an experienced player building their ship quickly/well hurts the newer players in multiple ways: better players start in front, better players are probably well-equipped enough to use up all the one-person-only opportunities, in later rounds the better players use up many of the more-desirable components by building faster, and if the better players are cutthroat they'll flip the timer early enough that newer players will have barely-functional ships. Great for the first half-dozen plays, though, if everyone's learning together.

The frantic build-your-own-spaceship part of Galaxy Trucker is absolutely briliant and unique, but after that it all comes down to staring at the board and waiting for dice to determine whether your ship (and its valuable cargo) is going to be blown away by meteors, blasters or an overwhelming combination of both. It's a fun game to play, but way too random and chaotic to be taken seriously.

Components: All around great components. The modules are easy to comprehend, despite their variety; the cards have clear iconography; the astronauts, aliens, batteries, and spaceship pawns are all cool. The only downside is the shear number of components; I found it necessary to buy a tray to house them during play.

Experience: What a fantastic game; a brilliant concept that delivers. In the first part of a round, there are opportunities for strategy, for how I hope to best avoid the many dangers to come, especially if I'm looking at the upcoming cards. It's so fun to build my ship, trying to cram it full of necessary components.

In the second part of a round, I'm just watching what happens, hoping for the best; there are a few decisions, but mostly it is passive, but still fun, seeing my spaceship fare against the system. There are several different ways to score points. I am fully engaged throughout the game. And it is incredibly satisfying to laugh off a minor asteroid by saying “well-built”.

RATING: 3
Very long personal comment because I'm ripping on a "popular" new game.  Keep in mind my comments are made in the context of me WINNING the game, these are not sour grapes.  A rating of 3 means "Likely won't play this again although could be convinced.  Bad."  This fits my opinion of this game perfectly.  The frantic building race at the start of the round lacks any real decision making.  You're simply trying to build the best space ship.  Can't use a part?  Keep digging.  (Contrast this to the real tension in Factory Fun's real time building decisions:  You can and will get burned if you can't choose rapidly in FF).  I'm not just ripping on the real-time building mechanism,either, I rate Factory Fun a 7.  The "race through space" in the second half of the game sucked.  It contained no real decisions.  Do I spend one of the green chips to use my laser or do I let my ship get blown in half?  Hmmm, I'll have to think that one over for a while (note, this last sentence was sarcasm).  I do not see what other people apparently see in this game.

RATING: 7
Base game is great fun... But only in one of it´s two parts. Tile real-time ship building is such a fun, that "so so" space journey part with it´s low difficulty is just necessary evil before you can return to another turn of extra fun ship building. This imbalance was solved in expansion(s), which transform(s) Galaxy Trucker into beloved game by many; but this is "just" base game. And as it is, it´s just good (enthusiastic 9/10 for the building part and bored 6/10 for fly part).

RATING: 10
Building the ship is very funny and clever. The rest of the game is a bit automated, but there are important decisions to be made and funny situations happen frequently. I really like this game and its mechanics. Some cards might be a bit more balanced, but the game works as a well oiled machine. Give it a try!

Only iOS. I haven't played this outside of the iPad but I can't imagine it being better, as the iPad allows mechanics like timed selection, randomness, missions etc. to work in a way that wouldn't really work without the technology. Plus the campaign was hilarious. The only reason I didn't give this a 9 is because when I compare it to the games that I have given a 9 to, this is missing something, probably in not being a game that I would want to still be playing occasionally years later.

We've still not got the balance right between building quickly to pressure each other into making messed up ships, so the 'adventures' end up being a contest between who fitted the most guns, which sort of misses the point.

My first play was with others who'd played MANY games of this, and I found myself lucky to be alive at the end of each round with little or no income, while watching others rake in the credits.  I left the table with a feeling of indifference toward the game.

Recently, I found a copy on the cheap, went for it, and tried it at home with my wife (who'd never played it).  The experience felt very different, and definitely more enjoyable.  Despite being interrupted by a nursing baby, she won!

She liked it, and said so even before she won (which usually helps her opinion of a game).  But it was a fun gaming experience for both of us, I can't think of anything I didn't enjoy about it, and I'm looking forward to many more sessions.  So for now, it's an 8.

Update: down to a 7 because apparently my wife would rather play others in our collection.

Update: Traded.

Fast and fun game. Original mechanics , at least for me: real-time tile getting is great with 4 players. Felt it's way too luck dependent. You can destroy a ship with bad dice-rolling even if it's built in a perfect way. But that's the fun part of the game.
After a few years and games, I played it again but missed  the fun factor. It's not my kind of game. Too much luck and takes too much time in 4 for what it is. I still recognize the innovation but that's all

Is Vlaada Chvatl the next great designer? If his recent output is any indication, the answer may very well be, "yes." A game that makes a real time genre actually enjoyable. Galaxy Trucker also features the best rulebook I have read in years (entertaining [b]and[/b] well-written) - I probably wouldn't have given this game a second look without the humorous style of rules writing, but I am very glad that I did.

For me direct player interaction is an essential element of a good boardgame. Galaxy Trucker is not about interaction. At all. 

Yet it's a very fun game.

So what makes this game so much fun? Puzzling to build your ship - nervously watching the progress of other players. But the most fun part: watching the ships fall apart. Piece by piece...

No deep strategy, no tactics, just fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I think I honestly enjoy the ship building aspect of Galaxy Trucker moreso the actual core gameplay. Despite that, there is something delightful about throwing together a piece of junk with all your engines on the wrong way around and then watching it explode in space.

Very often when I've played this though, we usually end up getting bored by the time you have to build your second ship. The random events are not diverse or interesting enough to see me want to go through more than once, which is an honest shame.

This is a great game to play while waiting for other people to show up - once they do, you can simply declare whoever has the most intact ship the winner, and then move onto something a little bit less dry.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Galaxy Trucker equals great fun. Building your own ship is interesting and seeing whether it makes the trip or not is just as good. What I really like this game is that there is virtually no downtime. When you are not furiously grabbing parts and building your ship you are flying it and (hopefully) dodging asteroids. I do not recommend this game for serious people or those playing just to win, but for those who can watch half of their ship blown off and laugh at it!

I understand that this is a game that can be "won" by accumulating the most money, but--for once--winning is really not the goal.

Who cares about cargo when you can fit another laser on your ship instead?

1. Spend ages sorting pieces, setting up and (if there are new players) explaining the rules. 

2. Frantically piece together your ship in about a minute - this is the game. 

3. Spend ages working through the journey, during which you have very few choices, and watching your ship fall apart. 

4. Repeat.

I was pretty disappointed by this game.  The first play through was fun, but it quickly became very easy to 'break' the game and constantly have a winning strategy.  My wife stumbled upon it first: just make your ships have little to no exposed connectors on the outside.  Bam.  You have just drastically increased your odds of winning.  Also, the cards and 'randomly' come up become very predictable and boring, and the game never feels new or fresh, or like you have any control over what you're doing.  The game plays you, you don't play the game.

RATING: N/A
Stage 1: Simultaneously grab pieces as quickly as possible to build a cargo spaceship. Stage 2: Fly the spaceships around a track and watch them fall apart as asteroids, pirates, etc. strike. Rules are easy to pick up, but experienced players are at an unusual advantage in round 1. 2-4 players, better with more; hour plus.

Perfect for double dating, as you can team up and switch ships etc. Unfortunately some people find it hard to remember the different ship parts, so the learning curve is maybe a little too steep. Gives the same kinda laughs as Roborally. +0.5 for being a solid 2-player game.

RATING: 4
After one play, not impressed. The ship building mechanism via tile draws doesn't appeal to me. It's either going to be like slapjack if you play with the standard rules, or take way too long if you draw tiles in a round-robin fashion.

Once the ships are built it suffers from a "poor get poorer" problem where one catastrophe generally leads to another, which significantly drops your income. Unless your opponents suffer a similar fate, it's game over man, as I was in about the first 20 minutes of the game I played.

RATING: 7
What I liked:
Bit of tension to building up your ship, especially on the first play. Then watching it crumble as you play the game.

What I didn't like:
Nothing broken as such.

There is a fair bit of luck involved but it isn't really a game you play to win, you more play it to watch the carnage that ensues.

RATING: 10
This designer is one to watch for; many of his games have been quite good and are all very diverse. With this title, his witty rules delivery and wacky theme creation are on display, big-time. It's a multiplayer solitaire game in which players repeatedly construct spaceships, only to send them hurtling through the galaxy to be blown to smithereens. Spaceship construction is done in real-time, which makes for tons of laughter and all-out madness. If you like a game that doesn't take itself too seriously and is just plain fun, get this game...NOW, do it now!

Update: After playing countless times with several different groups, I'm liking it more and more. I'm increasing my rating from a 9 to a 10.

It is very fun to build the ship. However with my few plays I find the actual flying of the ship very hard. I guess we should of taken a look at the cards, but even then eight or so firepower is hard to fit on the ships for us at least.

After more plays this game is way more fun but some of the higher firepowers are hard to get to, but that's the point it's no fun if you always make it through with a perfect ship.

Ive taken a long time to rate and comment on Galaxy Trucker.

Fun game of spaceship building that is pretty easy to explain to non-gamers.  It certainly favours more experienced players, but the fact that is just fun to play whether you are leading or trailing means that I think I would pretty much never turn down an offer to play it.

Factory Fun meets Space Dealer (which I hate) and sweet music is heard in the emptiness of space. I guess it’s a game that should be taken too seriously as playing it really competitively would probably lower the fun rating. It’s better to try and fail spectacularly than to build those super effective ships that are possible to build if you go through the pieces really quick.

I'd rate it an 8 with the expansion. I haven't actually played it without the expansion so wild guess here that it would be less fun.

A game in two acts: one beautiful, the other plain.

Ship construction is a dynamic, hectic experience that is packed with fun and tricky decisions.  Timed gameplay is a rare thing and this is to be savored.

The actual journeys feel like a letdown by comparison.  Though there is a great deal of drama and the joy of watching ships get mangled, the lack of decisions removes much of the desired tension.

Fun but flawed.

I should really like this game more than I do because the theme is well done.  But I'm not a fan of real-time games that don't offer many decisions.  Are there really any tough decisions in this game?  You draw a bunch of tiles as fast as you can and piece together a ship.  You want engines in back and ideally guns facing out on the 6,7,and 8's.  Throw in some cargo holds, and human/alien quarters. So the game is all about looking for the right pieces to fit your puzzle.  The winning move is to recognize what you need and build it fast.  In the 2nd half of the game there are really no choices as you rely on luck to survive cards and dice rolls.

Galaxy Trucker was an interesting little game, that I have to give props for being rather innovative. Unfortunately, I found it to lack enough depth to make me really interested in it. Also, for whatever reason, both times we played I won rather easily, making my desire to play the game rather low. Why bother playing a not especially deep game that I win so easily again?

RATING: 9
Players construct a spacecraft out of spare parts, then run it across a series of events (the "flight") to try and turn a profit.  Amusing game where ships are constructed from Carcassonne-like tiles in real time.  The bits include crew quarters, engines, cannons, holds, etc.  The object is to build a ship that can do everything - beat off pirates, survive meteors, pick up loot along the way, etc, and still hold together to reach the end of the journey for the big payoff.  However, bits are likely to fall off and if it's the wrong bit, your ship may literally split in two (especially if using the Rough Roads Ahead expansion).  Lots of laughs in this one, especially in the rulebook, but there is a game here.  Bit like Frankenstein - the assembly of the ship is frantic and thinky, while the flight is fast with lots of laughs and groans.  Brilliantly done, and surprisingly getting better with each play.  If that keeps up, Factory Fun and Space Dealer are destined for the trade pile - this game seems to have them both covered.  Great bits, too.

I had some serious beginner's luck on my first play. I've since played the app a few times, and either the computer is cheating, or I'm terrible. Either way, this game isn't about winning anyway. It's really about building a spaceship, and the components really make you feel like you are doing just that, which is something that cannot be conveyed in the app (no matter how well done it is).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
More tense than the light-hearted design would suggest! If you freeze under pressure or hate when a card draw completely wrecks your plans, this isn't the game for you. But if you can roll with the inevitable ship-wrecking asteroid strikes and accept the imperfections of building a junky ship under the gun, GT can be a lot of fun.

One of my favorite game designers as he tends to create games with unique game mechanics.  This is a great game with a lot of laughter as your ship is slowly disintegrated into pieces as it's delivering space goods.

RATING: 8
Update: The last several times I've played this, I've had less fun. The building of the ship is something you can improve with over time, subsequently it becomes less stressful (and perhaps less fun). Playing with the expansion would solve this problem if all players were at the skill level which just hasn't been the case. 

Years of playing with LEGO has primed me for loving this game. Awesome, a total blast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Charming in the extreme, never too taxing on the mind, and it clips along at a frantic pace. Even though some of the sub-games aren't exactly new, the synthesis feels quite fresh. It is certainly fun and unlike most other experiences, and I'd find it hard to turn down a game from.

First comes the 'race to grab parts and cobble together your spaceship' phase, which is amusing to try and see if you can even get the thing assembled! Then the ships line up and make it through a deck of challenges: pirates, meteors, war zones, you name it. As you make your way through you might pick up some goods, but more likely you'll have large chunks of your ship fall off. Especially if you build ships like me, where one little connection is the only piece keeping the whole right side attached to the rest of the ship! Rewards for being in first place, selling cargo, and for tidiest ship. Unique, positive, and especially fun!

RATING: 7
Idea:
Build your spaceship from junkyard and race to finish line avoiding events and gathering stuff from planets.

Mechanism:
First build ship by going through pieces on board (flip them upside) and either put it to ship or leave up for others to pick it. Each piece has 'exits' so that it must fit to your structure and position of piece affects its function (gun direction, shield direction, engines to back only, crew cabin location). You can also look at even cards that will appear but meanwhile others can build their ship
Then you go through cards and resolve effects. If you built your ship right and have some luck you get to finish line with most points.

to who:
If you like to think visually how ship builds up and like easy to learn games this is good.

Build a space ship from various components in real time, with everyone grabbing tiles as quickly as they can (with some restrictions, like only being able to use one hand and having to finish placing a tile before grabbing a new one).  Then take your ship on a journey which throws various hardships at you to test how well your ship was built.  You need to find some amusement in the thought of watching your ship get cut in half by an errant meteor to enjoy this one.

Galaxy Trucker has a lifespan. I guess most games do, but it's kind of short. The frantic action is the bulk of the game, and once you reach a certain level of quality shipbuilding most of the fun sort of leaks out. Until that point is reached (which is maybe a dozen or so games), this is a fairly unique experience that's always a fun romp.

Galaxy Trucker stands out as a spectacular game from the most ingenious board game designer in the world.  The timed building aspect of the game is something very unique, very fun, and rewards repeated play.  Expansions that make the game optionally harder for experienced players, balance out the gap in ability between new and veteran players.  Thematically strong and mechanically tight, Galaxy Trucker stands out amongst any other game I've played.  Highly recommended.

iOS implementation amongst the best digital board game ports ever made.  Absolutely rekindled my love for this game.  Czech games and Vlaada are the best.

It is a very clunky, awkward game that is just not exciting at all.  Too many conditions for tile placement and too many conditional events. I found that we (those of us playing) were constantly correcting ourselves and others in placement and how thing impact our ship.  Several people discovered that they accidentally placed a tile incorrectly too late.  The "draw" phase is a free-for-all. That alone drove me crazy.  I actually stepped out during the second round to allow someone else to play my position - I was not enjoying any part of it. And, we didn't even finish the game.

This is the first board game I've played that has Real-time tile placement.  Quite an experience, a real gem!  Experience wise, it is a hit & miss kind of game.  Those that like it, will like it alot.  Those that dont, will leave it cold.  The rulebook was written to be humorous, but detracts from the effectiveness as a reference/teaching tool.

I just don’t get why some people like this game.  I’ve played this a few times and honestly, I guess its aimed at people that like to go to the beach, spend all day investing time and effort to build an intricate sand castle and then get immense joy taking a shovel and smashing it to little pieces before they leave for the day.  
After building your ship (in a corny real-time one-handed manner), your ship is haphazardly torn apart by events that are completely chaotic, random and out of your control.  I’ve seen some players get all excited when they roll a number and an asteroid just misses their ship or takes a wing off another, but I just don’t get it.

My group played this to death in one session.  We were completely annoyed by the silly flip-over-a-hundred-counters part of the game, nor were we big on the way you were allowed to peek at the cards showing some of the hazards you were about to face.  That almost instantly became an automatic strategy to the point where we might as well have laid out those cards face up.  Only an idiot would throw his ship together without viewing as many hazard cards as he could; there was simply no reason NOT to do so.

The ship building rules were fun and cool (how you could add tiles to your ship), and watching ships get destroyed was fun.  But the constant tile-digging-and-card-peeking stage drove everybody crazy.  Peeking at hazard cards was the obvious thing to do, and what you saw there totally drove your ship-building "strategy."  Pointless.

Plenty of fun in a game where you "should" construct an airship, fly "it" through the space, avoiding meteors and enemies, finishing (if you really finish) delivering the goods to your final destination.
It's played in real time in the fase of construction.
Really good game.

Nice game with an interesting mix of mechanics.  First comes the search for parts, which I like.  Next check out your neighbor's ship for faulty construction.  Then the missions.  Overall, enjoyable, but I'm not running to play it again.

Ugh.  You build a ship and then watch it get blown to smithereens.  I just find it so boring that you only really "play" the game during the real-time part; the rest is mostly just spectating with the occasional "do I do X action or not".

The perfect medium complexity fun game. If you don't mind a game that takes a lot of planning in which you 1) may have too little time to plan (space ship building phase) 2) pure randomness can destroy all of your plans (rolling dice during flight) then this is perfect for you. The rules are a good indicator. If you don't find them hilariously funny, then the way this game develops might not be serious enough for your liking.

This was supposed to not be opened until Christmas, but I couldn't wait. And glad I didn't. It's different than most anything I've played to date. The boys have been a bit apathetic about playing anything of late, but the youngest can't stop talking about this one. Update: this game is addictive, but if one player grasps the puzzle aspect better than the others (especially in a two-player game) then it becomes only fun for one.

Not a fan of the graphic design on this game - it's clunky and messy.  Building the ship is fun, and the second part of the game can be tense! If you're adverse to seeing your creation get ripped to shreds, stay away. 

The game would be a 10 if the rules for the card flip phase needed less referencing - but that's probably more my issue than it is the game.

Awesome game though.

not much of a game. 1st part of the game building your ship out of a common pile of tiles, is fun for a while but the 2nd part of the game flying your ship through an event deck seems more of an add on to justify the first part of the game. no real choices to make.

Traded for Jambo & Mr. Jack.

I really wanted to like this as I loved both the theme and the idea of the mechanics. (Randomly pick tiles to build your spaceship and then have it travel across the galaxy delivering goods and getting blown up? Yeah, sounds awesome!) Unfortunately, it was not as much fun to play as I had hoped.

What a crazy concept. A bunch of people scrambling to build ships under a timer, which is controlled by the players themselves. It's a lot of fun to throw down some pressure on the timer when your build is going well. The flight through each stage get increasingly difficult, but exponentially hilarious. I burned out on all the different icons after awhile, but it was fun!

7 for the game, but 8+ for the app. The game is hard to get to the table and tough to teach, but hilarious when it works. The app cuts out all of that to make a great little game. People complain about the lack of choice once your ship is built and you fly into space. I don't see that, but the app removes any hint of 'going through the motions' after building the ship.

Super game of the rare breed of REALLY original games. Even though this is something of a multiplayer solitaire game in a way, building your space ship and having it shot to ribbons is a lot of fun. Kudos for CBG - this is probably their best game so far (from an already impressive run of titles).

Humoristic and thematic space exploration game. Tile laying mechanic will keep the game fresh regardless of the rather thin event card deck. Especially fun when ship wrecking ensues and no-one gets to the finish. Mind you, this game is not a plain luck-fest due to clever game design.

I must be a mutant as my other serious gamer friends seem to like this, but not me. I've always hated speed games... which is mainly what this is. Take that element out and I'd add a rating point.

I also dislike when games create a longer game length by simply repeating the game over and over. In Galaxy Trucker you do just that, make a ship that's Small then Medium and Large. sigh

Sorry, but to me "uncovering tiles faster" and "being lucky in uncovering the needed tiles" doesn't equal skill. Winning because you know/memorized the cards that come up doesn't equal fun. There are some very cool ideas in this game, but I wholeheartedly dislike the end-product.

I think this game is ones people either love or hate. 
Some players cannot find the ship building phase as a part of gameplay so they don't mind to concentrate on it and they can be totally pissed off with the game. But this game is one of the best ever made when played with the right players!

I have played the normal game about 4 times and then later games with the expansion tiles and some cards from the expansion.

A Vlaada classic. I don't love the simultaneous part of this game, as I really want to make the best ship possible, but that's just not what this game is about. This game is about making the most "good-enough" ship as fast as possible. The game escalates nicely over the three rounds, and I have yet to play another game that comes remotely close to recreating this experience. Also, the app is top-notch, and I like the turn-based component selection variant (though it is not really a sustainable option with big groups).

Lately we've seen lots of luck heavy, dice-driven Eurogames that, for whatever reason, just don't feel too fun to me. These new games seem to sacrifice good planning for the addition of dice and randomness to their games. 

To me, Galaxy Trucker is exactly what these games should have been. GT is full of luck in all sorts of different ways. The turn of a tile, the turn of a card, and the roll of a die, they're all here and they all combine to make a luck-heavy Eurogame very fun.  

7 to 6: It was fun my first few plays, but I just haven't had any type of desire to play it again. 

Update: The hype has seemed to have faded on me and GT. I've played a few other puzzle games recently and I've also sent GT by the wayside. I enjoy some basic puzzle games quite a bit - ubongo, take it easy, on the dot, high score, and the list goes on. For whatever reason, they scratch the puzzle itch more than GT. If you've played the basic puzzle games I've mentioned and you're looking for something with more theme and 'game' feel (vs the sheerly puzzle solving appeal the other games have) I would definately try GT.

Galaxy Trucker falls into the category of "experience" game, where the fun is in the process of the game and not in the winning and losing. The game even recognises this by saying that as long as you made money, you're a winner! Still, the game does deliver. The most concrete part of the game is in building the ship, and that is fraught with a weird combination of randomness and dexterity. But the rest of the game really just runs on autopilot.

Two games in one: a tile-laying ship-building phase, followed by a resource allocation phase.

Game length can be easily adjusted by altering the number of rounds played.

Apparently you either love this game or you hate it. Apparently I love it and my wife hates it. Actually from the groups ive played with, the women hate it and dudes love it. Probably because it's hilarious when a ship that was built with care gets ripped to shreds on the first adventure cards and everyone laughs at that person. Yea, its unfortunate but hilarious. You have to go into this game realizing that your ship is going to be dominated almost every round unless you have the perfect ship. The building phase is very tense, fast-paced, and basically a puzzle. The adventure cards do usually affect the first player more often than the other players so some rounds can feel dry for the person in last place or the second player in a two-player game, but the game itself is fast-paced enough that it's okay. You just want to survive the travel. So what if your ship gets torn in half on the first card, there's always next round. The ships become more complex with each round and the adventure cards become more demanding and dangerous. This game is tense in all the right ways and I bought the expansion before I finished the first game (not really, but I should have).

RATING: 8
Very original game, as you build a wacky space ship, then watch it get ripped to shreds.  Lots of fun, even if you're doing poorly, because your ship is a result of your creating work.  It has a real-time puzzling aspect that won't appeal to everyone, because it's half puzzle and half boardgame.  Negative comments remark on the amount of chaos because of the dicefest, or that the puzzling of the ship assembly phase didn't appeal to them.  A polarizing game that you'll either love or hate.

Amazing components. Great theme. new mechanics. Lousy rulebook. I'm a bit concerned about the fun factor being primarily in the shipbuilding, and the cards being mostly an elaborate way of scoring. I suppose the cards make it a game, not just an activity, but they just don't quite have the same aura of "Wow!" about them that the first part of the game has. So I guess I'm on the fence on this one.

That said, there seem to be "hmm..." games where one contemplates their next move, and there are "fun" games where one gets excited and things blow up. Some games seem to merge these edges of the continuum and make for intriguing and exciting gameplay. I tend to prefer games that fall more on the "hmm..." side of that continuum. I think it could be argued that GT is a fine example of a game well onto the"fun" side of things.

This game is Mucho Fun! Hits that perfect mix of humor, strategy, uniqueness, and luck. We have gotten a lot of laughs out of this game and still are not bored with it. The only knock on it is that half the game is exciting and quick, while the second half is just sitting around watching to see what happens. This knocks it down the list a little, but overall it is good fun.

I might applaud the design, but I certainly derive little pleasure from the process of destroying the ship. Likely more plays will bring desensitization.

RATING: 6
I really have to be in the mood for the kind of randomness this game brings to the table. There is some skill in ship building but the events ultimately are too random for building skills to matter that awful much. It's kooky fun with the right people in the right setting but doesn't hit the table that much for us.

RATING: 2
I feel like I'm missing something here. People describe this as "fun" and they say "laugh as your ships fall apart."  Why would I laugh at that? I worked hard on that ship. Except I don't think I've ever actually built a decent ship. Mostly I think I just don't like games where my stuff gets messed with.

A fun exercise in futility!  The enjoyment the game brings doesn't come from building the best ship and winning, but building a quick ship and watching it blown to smitherines by the hazards of space travel.

Really nice game and amusing, if somewhat all over the place,rule book, however it feels a little like once you are in the lead (first to finish your ship) you get all the bonuses that put you further in the lead. 

The time penalties for the goods stuff don't seem like enough. 

If you are the last to finish building your ship don't expect much profit from the trip.

We also find after a single round players are done and do not wish to play again starting from scratch building a ship.

Great game!  I love the tension in the building of the ship.  I like the events as well, but its really just a test of whether you built your ship properly.  I find the variety in pieces good.  I find the Big expansion adds a few necessary pieces (shields), but find most are not very useful.  I find because of the variety in pieces the game takes some time to explain to new players.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fun game where one builds a ship as a competitive puzzle with a timer.

However, once you build the ship you fly through space, and after 30+ plays that can get a bit tiring.

There are some variants included in the game which can rejuventate a bit, and we've played at least 60 or 70 games.   Main reason I play is that I have a family member who enjoys playing it preferentially to all other games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It plays nicely, but favours the experienced player. Knowing the best way to build your ship is an acquired skill, and knowing what hazards lie in the cards is a bonus. But the crashing asteroids made for great fun and despite a run-away leader, we still had a good laugh. Seeing whole sides of your ships peel off into space was awesome.

2017-02-20: DID NOT LIKE THIS!
I think the stress element leaked into the rules explanation since a bunch of rules wasn't explained until shit just happened.
On the first round, we hit 'Open Space' first, then the second thing was something that killed all my crew. "Oh, you died!" said the most experienced play which at that moment I wiped my board. But strangly enough you can still operate the shields while no crew is on board but not land on planets. . . wierd.
On the second turn someone actually brought out colored aliens from the box. Aha? Interesting? Would it kill someone if that was properly explained in the beginning? Also, on the second turn, everybody flipped their board I guess but I didn't and nobody told me I had the wrong side up. Good luck with that ship!
In the last of the three rounds, I read the rules and happily introduced the rule that cannons firing to the sides and backwards only count as one point. . . SINCE THAT SEEMED TO BE THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS FRIKKING GAME! (i.e. to miss rules and explain them at the worst possible time).

We actually played the 'Anniversary edition' but without expansions. The components were absoluty fine except frikkin player aids are needed to explain what the frakk is happening.

I've played Tzolkin, Great Western Trail, Terra Mystica, KanBan, The Gallerist, Vinhos. All with probably some rule not explained properly. . . NONE of all those quite advanced games were quite as frustrating as this to miss rules in. . . there is no time to ask for rules clarifications!

I guess this game grows with when you learn the rules but as an experience now for me? A solid frikkin turdlike 1 . . . HATED IT LIKE NOTHING ELSE!!
Current rating = 2 ( I can't count all of the missed rules into actually judging the full game. So congrats on the extra point crappy Galaxy Trucker!)

Love this game!!!
So much fun playing it!!

Building the ship is the best part of the game!
Good skill is needed, and taking parts from other players just because they don't have a place for them yet is so rewarding.

In addition, Every game I've played, there was some one who just couldn't build a ship which was half destroyed even before launch!

Also, this game is very chaotic. Eventually, even weak players will win the game sometimes.

Recommended ++

Edit:
Really one of my favorites!!!

After a few plays more, it finally became one of our group's favorites!!!!
Really happy about that.

I am a huge fan of most of Vlaada's designs.

I love the implementation of the timer (any player can start it if they feel they are ahead), which is an excellent way to balance the game's difficulty against the players' skill.

And it's just great fun to watch space ships being blown apart piece by piece.

This has a bit of Factory Fun in it when building the ships, and I love Factory Fun. 

In space it is important to be in the lead, yet the leader gets the brunt of the evil dished out.  And space can become a slaughter, but great fun.  As ships disintegrate the leadership can change quickly. 

Not until my 4th game was I finally building some decent ships.

Time tested--pulled out on a regular basis by many in our gaming group. 

Strategy: 7 is the most commonly rolled number on 2 dice. Therefore I try to put a gun at 7 on all sides.

Wild fun until the ship rips apart; it's all downhill for the unlucky ones.  The ship building has a nice tension to it, but the final race seems so unforgiving if you didn't manage to get the right amount of guns/crew/shields/engines.  Would play again with 4 players which I think must be the sweet spot.  Excellent components and original design.

A blast.  The fun factor really reminds me of Cheeky Monkey at its wacky best.  Getting destroyed was never so much fun.  The disaster mitigation reminds me a bit of In the Year of the Dragon though since the events are blind (unless you peak) you can't plan.  Obviously it's more random... the randomness is in the event resolution instead of in the initial setup.  (I own the compatibility pack)

RATING: 5
Minus the dexterity element, this game is not that bad. However, since how quickly you need to assemble your ship that has valid placements, and the central role that it plays in how well you will do, including simply having to discard illegal attachments, can result in disappointing experiences. There isn't enough gameplay either besides the spaceship construction element.

I love this game. It was supplanted somewhat when someone in the group picked up dungeon lords, but I find I have a better time playing galaxy trucker.

The games are sufficiently different that I enjoy both, but I still prefer GT.

Chaotic, full of bits and pieces, and seems to revolve around your ship being destroyed. I found it too long and complicated to play casually, and too luck-based to play competitively.

I can see why people enjoy it this game; the theme is cute, and there are a variety of intesting mechanics. However the theme overtakes the gameplay and the mechanics seem a bit gimicky. This game didn't catch me.

I'm not so hard on it now; you have to play it for fun, in short bursts.

I like this game just because it's different and wild.  Sometimes you need that.  The expansion adds the proper amount of complexity to keep you busy for a long time to come.  Unfortunately, it's just not a game that many people are naturally good at.  It takes a bit of grooming to get where everyone is using the more difficult expansion elements.  Handicapping just yourself with rough road cards gets old fairly quickly.  The combo of base game and expansion is a little expensive to keep around for how little play it sees, but I can't help feeling I would miss not having it once I got rid of it.

At first it seemed to be fun. But in the end (3 game experience) for me it turned out to beone of the most frustrating games i've ever played: you know that you cannot prepare your spaceship against ALL things that are supposed to happen during the journey through space. But if all the time exactly THOSE things happen you have not prepared for.......... Sometimes I don't mind games that are based on "luck only". But THIS is the one game where NOT being lucky is REALLY frustrating.

Dentro de um tempo limitadíssimo nós devemos montar uma nave espacial cargueira que em um segundo momento vai passar por uma série de eventos. Dentre eles, coletar recursos nos planetas, chuvas de meteoros, ataques de naves inimigas, etc. A nave pode ter compartimentos para tripulantes, compartimentos para alienígenas, espaço para carregas, propulsores, lasers e escudos. Tudo isso deve ser montado em um período de tempo curtíssimo. O grande problema é que ao final dos eventos a nave pode ficar bem avariada e acabar transportando poucos recursos. As avarias são definidas na rolagem de dois D6. No final da cada um dos três turnos as mercadorias se transformam em dinheiro. Quem tiver mais dinheiro no final do jogo vence. Muito legal o jogo.

One word: Lots of laughs.
Extremely fun, yeah!
Really, drastically funny!
First: The construction of the ship.- Against time, everyone has to fight for the same pieces in order to build their own space ships... but they will never be as good as you'd like.
Second: The flight.- Absolutely chaotic, unpredictable, with a high probability of being completely destroyed during it.
So, I repeat: Lots + lots + lots of laughs (of course, just if played with the appropiate group of people; with what I'm meaning: not for people that suffers when losing is THE possibility, and winning is, many times, a matter of luck, or even, of attitude.

Galaxy Trucker is played in two distinct phases. In the first, players build their spaceships in realtime, grabbing tiles from a common pool and assembling them in the best possible way. In the flight phase, those ships are sent out to earn money and on their voyages have a number of encounters, both good (e.g. trading opportunities) and bad (e.g. pirate attacks, asteroids), but mostly bad. This is where the previously built ships have to prove that they are more than the scrap heaps they look like.

It's rare that a ship comes through unharmed, and points are scored depending on how well the encounters went, and how much of your ship is actually left. Repeat three times, with the ships getting bigger and encounters getting meaner, and the player who made the most money wins.

Whether you like Galaxy Trucker or not depends mostly on whether you like the frantic ship-building under time pressure.

This is super fun to play-until the game decides to utterly destroy you. If you go into it with the attitude that you will not be able to finish a round unscathed(most of the time) then you should be fine. This game is a solid 8 to me for the fun it provides, the different types of games all built into one(puzzle, race, space epic...well, kinda) and the fact that it kinda makes you feel sorry for your fellow players.(Or it may satisfy your need to watch your enemies be utterly destroyed, you can always go that route.)

Probably better if played with 8 players (4 teams of 2). One pick a tile, the other places it. No communication allowed. This is a game for 4 players, but it got more meat as a party game.

There's a lot of randomness and craziness, but this is an extremely fun game nonetheless. If you're not expecting a game where you carefully analyze each decision then you will have fun. This is a game where you will make a lot of mistakes, but it's fun as long as you remember that your opponents are too. 

You ship is often hideous before leaving the port, much less by the time it's been shot at and pummeled with meteors. That's half the fun.

My only complaint is that it takes way too long for being so light. Having three phases helps with the randomness and bad luck, but you can trim it down to 1 or 2 phases if you need a fast game.

Second phases is the journey and trade portion where your ship is subjected to the rigors of space.    The ship-building part is a lot of fun, the second phase is just average.  It's worth it for the frantic chaos ship-building phase and if you have the right table, laughing at other's misfortunes where their ship is destroyed in the randomness of the journey phase.

An ok game.  I think it is innovative for sure, but for me it just felt a bit gimmicky.  It wouldn't seem like it would stand up to a lot of repeated plays.  That said, it is quite fun and wacky to play!  It is more of a social game than a strategy game.  When played this way, it is a lot of fun.

This game it's like playing a video game. You get a really nice feeling building your spaceship grabbing different tiles and trying to match them. Then the journey through space begins and your ship tries to survive. There is a lot of luck involved but that's ok, it's really fun. The only thing I dislike about this game is that your ship can be wrecked in the beggining of the journey and you have to resign and wait until all of the other players finish. Also that when you are behind in a stage is really difficult to gain points ahead.

RATING: 7.4
This is a fun game with two parts.  The first is building your spaceship (in a set amount of time), trying to make sure you have enough engines, crew quarters, guns and such to be able to survive pirate attacks, pick up treasure and have someone left to fly the ship.  The second part is watching your ship get blown to bits by pirates, asteroids and your own bad ship design.  I like both parts, but for me the second part is not as fun as the first; I most enjoy building the ship that looks like the Enterprise.  A fun, quick game with strong theme.

Hilarious light game, loads of fun looking at other players` spaceships break into pieces. For my liking it lacks a bit of hard player interaction (I can never shoot another player, although I built 5 of those double cannons on my ship??), but for drinking a beer and laugh an hour it is perfect.

Large meteors are a$$holes.

I really didn't care for this the first time I played it.  It wasn't at all what I expected, which was something much more strategic.  I wanted to try it again mainly to get "revenge" on the game, and absolutely loved it.  Having the right frame of mind was key.

Racing to build a ship and then watching every single ship get blown to pieces during the space journey sounds like it would make for a horrible game but Galaxy Trucker is loads of fun.

Would give this another chance. In bad mood, tired when I played it. Also, played the wrong way- had to keep tiles, could only put 2 aside in -$ thing. Real rules allow you to put back face up. Would be better to draft in piles, I think. Don't like time pressure of drafting. Could get better with better plan for building ship.

Build your own starship and keep it away from the meteors, pirates, and illness.
There are 3 and a "half" levels, but your starship will be bigger and bigger for a chance to be smaller and smaller, because you can easily loose parts of your starship.
Watch your starship, build it faster than other players can.
Really funny game.

A really fun game that I totally suck at. I guess it's the whole time limit thing. I don't like to feel rushed when playing a game but I do understand that it's needed for this game to add the tension and feel to the game. I liked this game alot and you do get a lot for the game, but I can't justify the price on this atm. It may take a few plays to get the feel for it and to learn what all the tiles do, but it's a blast to play. Hopefully some day I can come across a more affordable copy.

Many thanks to my gaming friend Chris for teaching me this game.

Man this game is great fun. Whenever I sit down to play, we end up doing 4-6 trips in a row.
My friends don't seem as into the whole "dying is fun" thing, but they put up with the destruction of their ships with some humor.
But in general this game is just excellent. I've played 2-player games with both my mother and a girlfriend, and they both enjoyed themselves. My mom even told me to bring it to Thanksgiving.
PS - The big expansion is awesome. It's not required for admission, but if you already enjoy the base game, definitely pick it up.

Update - I don't play this as much as I used to. Sometimes feels like a chore to get out and set up, especially with all the expansion content making it harder to teach new players. Might be an idea to separate the expansions back out for a while!

Nearly a 10.  This game is a blast--pun intended!  Actually easy to learn and so fun to play.  Some people complain about the 2nd phase being boring, but my family thinks it's as much fun to watch your ship survive (or get obliterated) as it is to build it.  The only downside to this, honestly, is that I didn't start out with the Anniversary Edition.  I was on the fence, having never played this, now I definitely wish I'd just swung for the fences and got it.  Will probably sell this and buy the anniversary edition--it's that good!

Played many times now with different groups (girl friend, guy friends, even my parents!) and everyone enjoyed it. Explaining the rules overwhelms people at first but it makes sense once they dive in. I've learned I need to reinforce that connectors can't go to nowhere and that exposed connectors are counted per side (not number of connectors shown!). The theme and tactile building phase is great, and I personally enjoy watching my ship fall apart too. I got the first expansion and like having more variety in components and challenges. I've only played with 2-3 players but looking forward to trying 4 or 5 eventually (with the first expansion).

Sounded oh so good. And the real-time tile laying actually is a good time. But the deck o' chaos that follows each construction phase is a huge black hole that sucks in all fun. Players interact with the dice, not each other. A bit of a disappointment, this game.

Different building game with a semi-chaotic resolution round.  Lots of fun (don't take it too seriously) but there is clearly a lot of skill in constructing those ships.  My 12 year old boy likes it, and has taught it to a number of his friends now.

RATING: 8.5
Kickass game.  *Great* early impressions.  Tons of fun and laughter.  Lots of praying that you don't get hit in *just* that one spot.  The construction is good too and as the ships get bigger there is strong competition for tiles.  There are even some meaningful choices during the race portion with respect to relative positioning with other players.

Really innovative design.  I've played it a lot now and I stand by my earlier rating.  Someone really has to push the timing, though, to make this more than a pure efficiency game.  If someone is flipping that timer constantly it makes the game a hell of a lot more fun as it forces people to satisfice with their ships and make mistakes.

Such hoopla, such love.  I was concerned that this game was a little over-hyped here on BGG.  While I wasn't blown away by the game, I was certainly blown away in the game.  My ship sure had some issues getting past pirates.  The game is certainly entertaining and while you have little control, it's entertaining to see what happens to your ship while it tries to make it's way through the cosmos.  I enjoyed the game quite a bit, even with the hype.  Very nice production in the latest edition.

Update: Further playings have revealed what a fun game this is.  With the right frame of mind this is an excellent game.  I am not so great at it, but I enjoy myself nonetheless.

RATING: 6
Quite unique and fun! Vlaada is fairly consistent in his design technique. The 2nd half of the game rounds are indeed chaotic and silly, but the tension of the ship building is what it's all about. Those with an engineering mindset will love this, because you must build something functional within time constraints! That mostly what I enjoy. The actual missions/scoring points seems way too random, and really favors whoever is in the lead. I'm not the best at this game, so there are rounds where I feel like I'm not really doing much of anything for half of the game. This is a major design flaw if you ask me...never lose the engagement of your players.

RATING: 7.5
Tons of fun at first, but has limited replayability once you get to the point where you've become an expert at building ships. At this point, it's necessary to play with the max 4 players, because the only way your ship design is going to vary is if the pool of pieces to draw from is being depleted by three other greedy hands. It's also very imbalanced if you're playing against people who aren't as experienced as you, since the ship building is something that takes some getting used to. Which is unfortunate, because this is a game that I want to introduce everyone to because of how dang entertaining it is. But I know that I have to seriously handicap myself and purposefully build slowly and poorly in order to give them a chance.

I have the expansion, but I haven't gotten the chance to really break into it yet. It looks like it will nicely alleviate the replayability issues, especially as the expansion is actually several modular expansions that you can swap in as needed.

This was another pick-up from a friend who was getting rid of some games.

It's everything I wanted it to be.  It's probably everything I wanted factory fun to be, but the speed and imperfection of what you are making seems to appeal to me much more.

I don't have any of the expansions, and don't know if I'll get any of them - it seems great as it is.  

Components are excellent - I love the small green batteries.  Maybe my favorite part.

Vlaada, your games are too chunky and involved. Too many rules!! This is what prevents this from ever making it to the table - the game is more complex than it needs to be and teaching to my kids makes my brain hurt. My kids also get bored once they put the ship together.

Nice Chvatil too. I dont like tile-laying that much (though this reminds me a bit of the good old commodore 64 "paradroid"), thats why I still prefer Space Alert. Lets see what happens once I have got the expansion (in both cases ;-)).

The shipbuilding part of the game is fun, but the travel portion is random and mostly annoying. I suspect that someone who memorized the event decks and counted cards would be capable of various degenerate strategies, but I am not interested enough to check.

Galaxy Trucker is a soundly engineered game that does exactly what it was built to do.  It's also definitely not a game for everyone.  Among those who should stay away are those who dislike real-time gameplay, those who don't like games with a solitaire puzzle-solving feel, those who are allergic to luck, those who prefer to take their games seriously, and Dave Vander Ark. Galaxy Trucker is not a serious game. It's a wild ride. Once you've done the best job you can in slapping together your space ship, you merely hang on for dear life and hope the thing comes through in one piece. Which it pretty much never does.

I want to stress that Galaxy Trucker is by no means a novelty game like Space Dealer. It has legs. The process of building your ship is difficult enough and strategic enough to remain interesting over the course of repeated plays. Advanced players will be scouting the flight cards, tailoring their ships for the road ahead. Most of the game happens during this ship-building phase, but the flight phase has just enough going on to keep everyone involved and entertained. The flight phase is definitely not the meat of the game, but it's usually funny, often quite tense, and always creates a good narrative.

We love this game. My kids can't get enough of it. Its just so different from any other game. Placing tiles as fast as you can against the (egg) timer to complete different ships in ever increasing size. Trying your dangest to get the best tiles before someone else does, whilst balancing guns, engines, cargo holds, shields, crew, aliens etc etc to make your ship ready for flight to deliver said goods through meteor showers, pirates, smugglers and combat zones, with a hopefully intact ship, to the company for cold hard cosmic credits. 
Have been playing with the Big Expansion since 17th play. It has taken the girls a while to get the hang of the new tiles. They aren't game enough for the Rough Road or Evil Machinations cards yet. That's because they still get annoyed if their ship gets blown apart. This game has definitely given me some of my fondest gaming experiences with my daughters. It plays in under an hour with the three of us.

This is just a fun game. It is a stress game where you are building a space ship on time and pray that it will arrive in good shape filled with lots of goods. While the meat of the game is building the ship I don’t think that resolving what happens on the trip is less exciting.

While not very similar mechanically, it got the same excitement as RoboRally as there is stress and lots of oops moments and you have to have some spatial skills to do well in the game. This is not a game where people who can’t handle stress will do well at.

After a few games the decisions get trivial, although not less fun. This is something the first expansion fixes. Best played with four players.

Played a game of this with the Mrs, but unfortunate for me, she did not like it.  The ship building phase was fun for all but she didnt like how little control she had during the second part of the game.  I, on the other hand, didnt mind the randomness and helplessness that much.

As the Mrs had such a negative view and experience from the game, it will be unlikely I will be able to convince her to have another go in the near future....

While Space Dealer was rather a disappointment, Galaxy Trucker was ok. The real-time frenzy ship building is not my cup of tea, the second part is more interesting. However I am not sure about the replay value, but for now I rate it a 6 because theme and mechanics are good interwoven.
edit: after a further play I downrated it to 5 as even the flight phase is too luck driven.
Edit: downrated again, a game should be designed to be fun not frustrating.

Pretty darn nice production value, then again it sure should have considering the price tag. Upon rule briefing and drooling on the nifty bits I was super anxious to give it a spin. 

Everything sounded so promising.....the ship construction was fun.....then I got to sit there and watch the game mechanics destroy me for 15 minutes and compare notes with my neighbor. UM....did I miss the actual game?

Now I know how God must feel. Careful planning and forthought go into your creation, then you get to sit back and watch something destroy it, all while having no input on what is going on.

I'm goin' against the tide here.  It was fun to play, but the building of the ship was a race and the cards definitely affected the building design.  There is strategy, so it is not an issue with the luck, but I like Ubongo so much more in the time pressure category.

RATING: 9
The mood of the game (antic disaster) isn't always a great fit for the design (skill and experience both play a huge part in success). But with a group who've all played the game a similar amount and who realize the importance of looking at the adventure cards, a fun real-time antic disaster of a game. :)

RATING: 8
Love the hectic ship building and relatively quick playtime. Replayability is good between building ships differently and having different layouts entirely. The "downtime" while you're just flying through space is a nice break from the hectic building but the dice rolling keeps you from falling asleep.

Minor points loss for dice rolling but this is still a game that I've loved playing. Dice mitigated by the fact that everyone tends to get screwed equally, feels less like a competition and more like an experience.

This is an interesting game.  At its heart it's a "quickly pick up Carcassonne-like pieces to fill in a strangely shaped grid before the other players" game, but if you're not the fast type, you can still do *okay* by building your ship well.  After each round of building, a number of disasters and events will occur, and those with better-designed ships will fare better.  It's all highly random, but it's a fun, frantic time.

Certainly a very fun game, but I understand the complaints people have about it. It gives the illusion of control at the beginning, but once the ships are launched, randomness takes over. However, if you don't mind a large dose of luck, it can be lots of silly fun. The game can also be punishing to the person in last place for a particular run. Once there's a chink in your armor, it is very hard to stop things from getting continually worse.

This game is so much fun. The frantic ship-building against the clock is very enjoyable and then it just gets sillier and sillier as bits of your ship fall off, get smashed to pieces or blown away. I think it would actually be better to have a set time limit for ship-building as experienced players can often make excellent ships and for me half the fun is trying to make it through with a cobbled together junk-heap.

An excellent game of two acts. In the first half, it is a fun tile-placement puzzle where more players will place a positive pressure on the others. The second half is also fun but less so. While hoping your ship can survive, the game draws random cards to affect. The randomness of these rarely has a good excitement curve where players rarely pull into dock. It seems the card portion is either too easy or too hard. Otherwise, this is a great game and a fun way to build a puzzle, then test it.

[Played once] 3. "Likely won't play this again although could be convinced. Bad." Very disappointed; this seems to have had the potential to be so much better. Some people have compared this to Factory Fun because both games have a substantial real-time element, however I think even that similarity is superficial: in Factory Fun, the real-time choices you have to make are interesting, and you must be quick. In Galaxy Trucker, on the other hand, you just keep looking at pieces and junking them if they're no good: it seems more like lazy design than genuine innovation. Should I chance to give this further plays, I can easily see my rating sinking even lower.

If you don't take this game too seriously, it is pure fun... build your spaceship against the clock, and against your fellow space truckers, and then watch as bits of it get blown out of the sky by pirates, slavers and other miscreants.

The ship-building aspect definitely suits some people more than others.. probably those with good spatial, mathematical or engineering skills, and with good hand-eye co-ordination too! 

The space exploration aspect has some decisions to make, like stopping for cargo, points etc. and sometimes it distinctly helps not to be the lead ship... however a lot of the outcome of the exploration is pretty random with die-rolling to see where your ship is hit etc. But it's always funny to watch half your ship float off into space because one key component gets taken out that was holding everything together.

I once heard that Galaxy Trucker was a party gamer for gamers. I can't tell if that is true, but I can say it is a lot of fun.
I generally turn down dexterity games and time based games, it is, in a sense, both, and yet I can only say good things about it.
Deceivingly simple, Galaxy Trucker is easy to recommend to almost everyone.
Plays well with all player counts, but becomes harder with more people if you use only the base tiles (as there will be too few for all 4 to build well with).

I would probably rate it lower if it had a mundane theme, but I'm biased toward Sci-Fi, and the components are pretty cool, even though I would have preferred more detailed miniatures. The ship building phase is nice, although quite derivative of "Factory Fun". The flight phase, however, has very little and very obvious decision making, and there is a lot of luck with the cards and dice. Also, a defenseless player can be saved from the attack of enemies by simply being behind a well-armed player in flight order. Although thematically justified (the enemy is destroyed), that is the bit of randomness that annoys me the most.

Como juego de mesa, es un tanto raro. No es un euro de pensar y de mecanicas reposadas, tampoco es un ameri de aventuras y ñecos. de hecho en realidad, cuando te lo describen, lo que piensas es en un juego de MB de aquellos de los 90s... pero luego resulta que es un gran juego. 

La tematica es que somos cargueros espaciales (galaxy truckers) y tenemos que construir "la mejor nave posible", y luego ganar fortuna con ella en el espacio (que es como se gana, o no, la partida). la gracia del asunto es como se construye la nave. 

Cada jugador tiene un tablero vacio con una "planta" dividida en casillas, de la nave. y hay un monton comun para todos los jugadores de fichas boca abajo que son con las que se construye la nave. hay motores, cañones, escudos, pilas de enegia, espacios de carga, habitats para astronautas y para alienigenas (la nave para el viaje lleva tripulacion, que pueden ser humanos o aliens. hay dos tipos de aliens con normas especificas para cada uno), conectores, etc. de variadas configuraciones (conexiones por uno, dos, tres o los cuatro lados de la ficha). el metodo es coger fichas a voleo del monton, una a una, y combinar con ellas en el tablero (en el cual, si plantas una ficha, no la puedes sacar. te creias que iba a ser facil, eh? xD) hasta llegar a construir la nave. esto lo hacen todos a la vez y hay un limite de tiempo marcado por un reloj que puede manejar cualquiera de los jugadores. un free for all en toda regla. :D

luego de eso hay una fase en la que los jugadores se comprueban unos a otros que la nave del otro es "legal" (que no hay conexiones mal hechas) y si hay conexiones mal hechas se quita el cacho que esté mal y lo que cuelgue de el hasta que sea legal. si te has equivocado a lo mejor pierdes media nave antes de empezar la fase de puntuacion. 

y por ultimo llega la fase de "viaje" que es en la que se puntua. con un mazo de cartas aleatorio, las naves "viajan", cargan mercancias segun su orden de llegada y se enfrentan a peligros (piratas, naves abandonadas, asteroides, etc) con el objetivo de cargar las mas y mejores mercancias posibles, evitar o destruir los peligros y llegar el primero al final. en funcion de lo logrado, se otorgan puntos. gana el que consiga mas puntos. 

entendido? si? a jugar! :D

top5 de los "juegos ligeros".

That having been said, it's a blast. It's enjoyable building your monstrosity and then seeing it torn apart. Amazingly, the game doesn't seem to get old.

Popular with my Nephew and subsequently at the school boardgames club. Gets dull with good players.

Bought the second printing "the second" it arrived at my FLGS (Fanboy 3 Manchester).

Now looking for players!

Saw this played at Stabcon (Summer 08). The table seemed to be having a great time (much laughter). I caught up with one of the players later who said currently it's his favourite game.

There is so much luck, but even more fun in this game! Well, ok there are options to get control over the luck, but there is still a good amount of luck in this game.

The good thing is, this doesn´t make the game any worse. It is a fun game and as such it is a really great one.

The only negative I can think of is, that it may become less interesting by time, as players get better and better and due to this the fun may go down. Hey, nothing is more funny than looking at someone´s crappy space-ship getting bombed :P

RATING: 10
Board game crack.  

Much more control than some give it credit for.  Every attack can be prevented with proper ship building, and there is definitely room to keep getting better.  If you get your ship blown apart it's probably your own fault, though you can also luck out and sneak a crappy ship through.  I expect as we keep playing, scores will continue to rise.  

EXCELLENT rules, theming, and components, all with a sense of humor.  Great fun, and absolutely highly recommended if you like speed games, puzzle games, factory fun, or just plain fun.  

It's not too long by any means.  The last game we played, we extended the game even longer with the 3a ship.

I really hope this gets a US release, and many expansions.   My new favorite game.

09/11/08 Bought and played a couple of games with my wife.  But, when I opened the box the timer was broken so we've had to play without it.  Not having the time constriant really detracts from the game; it's less exciting.  Also, once a ship starts to lose components it goes downhill really quickly, which can be very frustrating.  May need to consider lowering my rating.

I like the mechanism of first building your spaceship and then going on a space journey.  But, I wonder if the game would become a bit repetitive after several plays.  There doesn't seem to be a lot of strategy in the space journey part.

Joc de col·locació de losetes en temps real en el que els jugadors han de construir una nau mitjançant un "stock" comú de peces (losetes) situat al centre de la taula. El joc té dues fases ben diferenciades, una primera en la que es construeix la nau, i un altre en la que s'envia la nau a realizar un "enviament" per guanyar diners (guanya el jugador amb més diners recaudats). Aquesta segona fase té molt d'atzar (tirades de daus, cartes agafades de forma aleatoria amb events), tot i que durant la construcción de la nau els jugadors tenen la possibilitat de veure el 75% de les cartes (perden temps per a la construcció de la nau...). Es juguen 3 rondes, cadascuna amb una nau més gran i amb events més "poderosos".
Experiencia de joc molt divertida, tot i que molt caòtica.

L'experiencia previa en el joc és molt important, amb 8-10 partides les naus que es fan a la primera fase son molt semblants entre si, de forma que decideix l'atzar.

A wacky real-time tile-laying game. I don't find the time limit very imposing so it's not about getting enough tiles but instead getting the best ones. The flying part is mostly just bracing for impact with minimal decision making thrown into the mix, but you really are at the mercy of the cards and die rolls. Definitely most fun when everybody takes a beating. (30.11.17)

I was a little disappointed by this. Building your spaceship is fun, but I felt there were too few choices in the second half of the game. You basically sit there and watch your spaceship get torn apart, piece by piece.

Good fun if you don't worry about your ship too much and just go with the flow. Your ship WILL break. Your crew WILL die. It's just about how much fun you can have laughing at each others different misfortune. Everyone has enjoyed so far even people I didn't think would.

Super fun whether you win or lose, and one of the most unique games I own.  More of a solitaire activity than a game, although there is some interaction as you compete with the other players for the resources, fighting pirates, etc.  Mostly, it is fun to build your ship and watch it get blown apart, or speed through space, whatever.

My first play through experience was a bit lukewarm, but after the 2nd and 3rd plays this game started to grow on me. Building your own spaceship and then seeing how it fares through space reminded me how similar it was to an old PC game I loved as a kid, Gizmos & Gadgets. I love building things and see them get obliterated into a black abyss. 

PROTIP: Expect your ship to come back in pieces.

Kell pár játék, mire ráérez az ember. Nehézségét tekintve hosszú partijáték, amit csak 4 ember játszhat.
 - Update: Jó játék, ahol a szerencse nem feltétlenül befolyásoló tényező, bár sok múlik rajta. Talán a parti játék megnevezés sem a legjobb, mert mi elég komolyan szoktuk játszani, és az a pár sérülés, amit közbe elszenvedünk (bár egyre ritkább, ha jól építkezünk), az meg elviselhető. De meg tudom érteni, ha - főleg az elején - nem tetszik valakinek.

After my first play (basically a learning game), I'm not sure what to make of this game.  I like the aspect of building your ship, and the simultaneous play keeps the game length down.  But I like to have more time to strategize, and it's hard to do that when the timer's running.

Also, I generally don't like games with dice, because they can be so random.  I tried to use strategy to overcome this -- I put side guns on row 7, hoping to defeat meteors that rolled 6,7,8, but they got taken out by rolls from front!  Annoying.

Overall, I think it's fun and worth trying again.

I love this, but it's not compatible with all gaming groups. People who end up with bad spaceships will easily be bored if they don't like it blown to pieces.

The whole puzzling and spaceship building and crew management and space management aspects make it quite fun for most people I played with though. There's essentially two games: First, grab stuff as fast as you can and try to build something reasonable, and then just watch it get torn to pieces.

Not a fan.  Building your ship is kind of fun but watching it get destroyed in the second half of the game is kind of boring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A light/funny game which combines a few elements: tile laying (when building your ship), light racing game (when going thru the "adventure deck") and resource collecting/management (energy and cargo).

Although it may be played by the entire family, there is nothing anyone can do to prevent an experienced player from winning, not to mention that the element of luck is rampant.

In the last game I have played, the experienced player never had more than ONE empty square on his ship!  In the third race, he had a laser in EVERY column, and only one empty square still...  It becomes extremely difficult to get the proper tiles as everyone draws from the same pool, so there is a large element of luck during the draw, as sometimes you will get a good piece you can't use, and of course someone else will grab it.  The experienced players will know which pieces NOT to return to the center.

Best (fun) played versus players of the same level.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun game with a bit of friendly competitiveness. Any game that gets my boys laughing at each other is great in my book.
The tense building phase and then watching the outcome as your ship succeeds or fails provides for a unique gaming experience. Despite the rather complex appearance it's actually a fairly quick game to teach and learn. I'm sure this will become a family favorite.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Well, I like the concept but I'm not sure I like the execution. Constructing your space jalopy takes a lot of effort that is just thrown out the window with the extreme randomness that follows. It's fine for a light "experience" game-- the disasters that inevitably happen are truly amusing-- but even at that it's pretty long. A miss for me, but I can definitely see the appeal and I'd play again in the right mood.

(1 play, 5 players, expansion included)

Perhaps the most appealing components ever. Unfortunately, it suffers from a steep learning curve, a massive table footprint, and a game length that's too long by half.

My biggest fear with this game is it'd be too random and chaotic.  To a certain extent, that was true.  Random cards of bad happenings with random dice rolls for ship explosions and random tile picking for ship building.  It feels like you just build a solid ship and hope for the best.

It is a lot of fun though.  The light theme, the fairly quick gameplay and ship creation is fun.  The randomness pretty much decides who wins.  In my first play, I went from only getting $1 the first round to $49 the last round in cargo alone.  It just so happened the planet cards came out with me ahead and I got some nice cargo.  It doesn't feel like I earned it by any strategy or skill.

The fun makes up for a large part of the huge luck swings though.  It's like Killer Bunnies - you don't really play to win, you play for the experience.

RATING: 7.5
First, I admit that I have difficulty grokking Vlaada's games. The rules are almost always enough of a barrier to gameplay that even though it is clear I have a well-crafted, well-thought out game, the play is difficult, or slow, or tedious because of the chrome, the catches, the amount of tracking or difficulty budgeting for things.

Galaxy Trucker is probably as difficult to play (well) as his other games, but it's the first Vlaada game I could love at first play.

It plays quickly- the timer and the spaceship tile draft make players move (as well as think) with some haste.  The resolution of adventures is quick (and painful) - and light-hearted.  The humor works here, even when half your spaceship is knocked off by meteors, and you are left a skeleton crew trying to salvage your goods and make it through.  My learning play took about 1 hour; of course I couldn't complete many trips which made things faster (Ow!).

It's accessible- build the 'Millenium Aardvark', then try to fly it to the Spice Mines of Kwyxil and earn some kind of a bonus.

It's tight- just what you've come to expect from Vlaada. But it's also got a little luck, as well as manic planning, and it looks and feels fun on the table.

I haven't given up on Vlaada's other games, but now I know why this one is well-loved.  I'm starting this at a 7.5, but expect that with madcap fun this one may go up.

RATING: 5.9
Not a game for me.
I like the ship building, its franticness, the fact that you create something. I feel like that part would however feel old pretty quickly, because there is not that much variety overall (even with a bagillion parts, they're mostly the same).
I hate the race part. It gives everything to the lead player, helping him get more headstart than he already has, and others don't do anything in the meantime. It's crazy! You get other people to come play, you get them to build a ship, but you don't let them play with it. Or just a little bit. I hate this mechanism.

I'll sell the game away. More race-oriented people do like it.

Winning in this game is a secondary goal. While the game isn't perfect, this is one of the most silly fun games I know of [random whiners/complainers begone!]. Building the ships are fun (as long as you don't have an obnoxious timer-mover person), but when you enter the events in space section each round, oh the jolly laughter when someone's weak spot becomes exploited and half their ship goes the way of Khan. There is indeed enough good mechanics involved for the serious gamer, but this is just jolly fun to our group, always. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun game, but with two major drawback:

-a bit too much randomness for the events. Determining the hits from pirates or meteoric swarms done by a dice roll and a bar roll can just kill your ship.

-if you are "killed" then then you finish the round idling. It can lead to losing interest.

RATING: 6
This is an interesting game within a game. The first part is a real-time race to build a robust space ship, with components drawn from a communal pile of stuff. The second part is fun as players race their hastily put-together piles of junk, that pass for space ships, around a race track, while having same said ships gradually get trashed as they run into asteroids and pirates. I'm glad I played this game. It is novel and unique, but it is not my cup of tea.

Update (01/31/12): I didn't realize this is one of Vlaada Chvátil's early designs, but can see where he got the inspiration for Dungeon Lords, where both demonstrate his linear thinking. In both games you build something up, whether it is a spaceship or dungeon, and then your design is slowly destroyed by asteroids or human adventurers in a linear left-to-right fashion. It didn't click for me in Dungeon Lords thematically, but it seems to work for Galaxy Trucker.

Man, what a letdown.  This looked great, and I feel as if I should love it, but it really felt flat to me.  I'm not sure what it's missing—it just came out as a mechanical exercise instead of the nail-biting, fate-hanging-on-the-turn-of-a-card experience it promised.

Perhaps I just need to relax and get into it more, but the cartoony art provides a speedbump I just can't clear.  Maybe... maybe if we had a more intuitive grasp of the rules so the game flows instead of clumps.  Nice idea, but that would require more plays, and this one's slipped far, far down the list.

UPDATE:  So we're playing and I'm bumping along the bottom and we make it to stage III and then I get a work call that forces me to step away from the table for a bit...  Upon returning I find out I won.  

[i]Huh.[/i]

UPDATE:  6 --> 7  Jeez, I don't know what my problem was.  This game's a riot with the right people!

UP-UPDATE:  Couple things.

1.  Don't let the engineer in your group endlessly noodle with the iPad app—he will build perfect ships no matter what tactics are employed against him, like "bogart all cannons" or the classic "sand timer cartwheel".  And then he'll double all your scores.  [i]Forever.[/i]

2.  It takes a certain kind of emotional fortitude to not weep openly when you finally finagle things to punch it to the front of the pack and run down the four-dollar pirate, putting salvo after salvo of beam weapons through his papier-mâché flying saucer, and then you're not even buzzed from your first celebratory Zgwortz when you warp around a neutron star and straight into the teeth of [i]Voidbeard the Pirate[/i] with his nonstop fusillades that peel your battery nacelles, fountain crew into the silent black, and pick your guns and engines off one after the other and so on until you're just screaming for it all to stop [i]stop STOP![/i]  And then the iPad-practiced engineer comes in and mops him up for the 12-dollar bounty.  There are words to describe that sensation, but they carry far more meaning when screamed inside an isolating helmet rather than read off a dumb screen.

[size=7]NOTE 1:  Normally I hate it when people use the generic term "dollar" for all intermediary economic exchange units in games when there are already perfectly appropriate game-specific designators like "ducats" or "galacticreds" or "orphan femurs", but it turns out that "four-dollar pirate" is funnier than the thematic alternative.

NOTE 2:  Voidbeard the Pirate, so-called due to his hideous predilection for weaving curdled space-time into his beard to strike terror into the hearts of his victims.  And man, does it [i]ever[/i].[/size]

RATING: 6
After the first play, the amount of luck and how devastating nature of some of the random events does NOT balance well with the amount of effort and tension when creating your ship.  It is frustating to work hard on a ship that gets blown apart be events that are beyond your control.  We will see after additional plays if I still feel this way.

Playing this game is a blast. Can't think of a game that is   more straight up fun than this one. Combines puzzle solving with a funny theme and enjoyable catastrophe. Peaking at the cards reduces the luck level in a really good way.

I'm not sure why, but I just don't have much desire to play this anymore.

For close to a decade, my wife has wanted this game but between life, finances, and lack of table space, we never got around to picking it up.

We finally did in 2016, and it has hit our table many times, and we always regret not buying it sooner.

There's a lot of luck and randomness, which I usually don't like unless the game is short (see: King of Tokyo). On the other hand, everyone is laughing for much of the game, so I feel like the fun more than makes up for a few niggling aspects.

Got it from my wife as a Three King's gift and I am excited to play it! Really, really annoyed that the cutouts weren't better pressed. I was careful and still ripped 3 pieces. Not cool at all. 

[b]Update[/b]: I just [I]knew[/I] it would be [B]rollicking[/B] good fun and a laugh a minute. But it turns out that, for the most part, it's just flipping over cards. I feel the game ends once I finish building my ship. Very disappointed, to be honest.

Ezt a játékot nem lehet és nem is kell komolyan venni. A középre kiszórt alkatrészekből kell űrhajót építenünk rövid idő alatt, úgy hogy nem tudjuk az űrben milyen kihívások jönnek velünk szembe. Az űrutazás alatt - amit kártyák jelképeznek - ugyanis jönnek meteorok, kalózok, felfedezésre váró bolygók stb. A célba űrhajóink elég ramaty állapotba érkeznek meg.

I love Galaxy Trucker for being absolutely unconventional and letting you make some very unique decisions but then inevitably giving you the feeling that you screwed up not only once (during the planning/grabbing phase when you realize you should have gone with the other tile earlier) but TWICE (during the action/card draw phase when you realize you should have gone with the GO***MN other tile earlier!)

The way I described this game to my friends was "This is not a game about doing the best, it's a game about doing the least-worst". Bad things WILL happen to you in Galaxy Trucker, but the game embraces that concept to HILARIOUS effect. This game is like the cardboard equivalent of stage improv: it's not about keeping things straight, it's about making things go off the rails as amazingly as you can.
Building your ship tactically will help you, but when an unlucky die roll lets a saboteur hit your center cabin, blowing up HALF of your ship in the first round, all you can do is laugh. If you have any sense of humor at all, then this game will leave you laughing the entire time; because you and your friends will know that the terrible thing that happened to your friend last round will probably be happening to you this round.

This game is fun, flat out. It is fast paced and as long as you are ready to laugh when random chance or unfortunate circumstances blow you, or your competition's ship out of the game, than you will enjoy this game.

I would suggest watching one of the youtube playthrough videos before your first game to help give you a jumpstart on learning the mechanics and rules of the game.

Building the ships is great fun and a great laugh. However, once you are done the 'game' part is not so much a game as it is things happening to you that you can do little to nothing about. There are almost no meaningful decisions after you finish building your ships, and that means for me and my group that the game is really boring punctuated with fun. Not ideal.

Also, if your group has anyone particularly good/bad at spacial reasoning, that difference in skill will come out big time as there isn't much of a 'handicap' system. Main reason my wife hates this game is that I destroy her at it. :/

Fitting tiles accurately into a grid under time pressure is a pretty specialised skill, one I probably don't have and so I doubt I'll ever do well at this game. This is something of a problem as being at the front of the 'pack' is very important in grabbing the cargo bonuses and so scoring well. However, this game is certainly FUN as the meteors swarm in and bits fall off your ship to much amusement from other players. A great 'experience' game.

Highly entertaining game where you build space ships out of spare parts (like Factory Fun only much more fun), only to watch them get battered or even break into pieces. Some of the funniest moments in gaming come when a well directed meteor or cannon splits a ship in half, even if it's your own you can't help but laugh!

Even better with an expanision and/or using the 3A ship for the third round!

The game needs to be simplified for children as they have difficulty arranging the pieces quickly.  Using the full set of rules gives an overly complex game.  It's not hard to adopt simplified rules for children and simpler rules for adults to get a more interesting gaming experience.  Work up to the full set of rules as you gain experience.  However, the "grab what you can" element of the game needs simple rules, otherwise the game becomes a chore.

Fun game.  Building your ship is stressful and fun... and then you get to see how it fares out in space.  There are fewer meaningful decisions in the second half of each round, and I can understand how luck might ruin some people's day, but I find it refreshing and fun.  Can't wait to play it again!

The only issue I have with the game is that it gets a bit stale once you've mastered ship building.  However, "the Big Expansion" fixes this by adding new ship boards, new tiles, more aliens, new rules for games with 2 or 3 players, and all sorts of nasty events in the "Rough Roads" and "Evil Machinations" decks.  There's also a variant to handicap experienced players when playing with new players.  The expansion really makes this game much more replayable, and I'd highly recommend it.

I really had my doubts about GT, but I still bought a used copy around 2008. How glad I am to have picked it up. Not only was it my first experience in the world of Vlaada, it was also absolutely a hilarious experience.

My one argument though is that players need to be on a similar level.

Really fun game concept.  And a game that works for both the family and for the gaming crew.

Spacecraft building is a terrific mechanic.  [As the engineer, I found this part of the game particularly enjoyable.]

There's just enough random elements - i.e., building a ship from "found" parts, what cards (encounters) will occur during a mission and in what order - to provide a very healthy replayability.  [On the flip side, the random elements combined with a modest amount (but not a lot) of decision-making once the ship is built keep the game from being categorized in the "deeply strategic" class - which is perfectly OK given the game's high "fun factor".]

Somewhere inside this game is a of part Carcassone and a part of RoboRally . . . both of which are good for me.

Much better than I expected.  There are a few too many fiddly rules for my tastes, but the overall experience is quite enjoyable.

I like building my ship as quickly as possible and as large as possible.  I thought the connection rules made a lot of logical sense.  I also enjoy trying to weather through all the calamities that come your way during the race portion.

I didn't enjoy the finer distinctions between meteor strikes versus fire combat attacks.  I also didn't enjoy the events that penalized people who were already in last.

Enjoyable game with the right crowd. Game doesn't take itself seriously so i suggest that for a crowd that would not play it seriously.  Although you need strong nervous to play it. You will try to build perfect space cargo ship on the first half of every turn and on the second half you will watch it burn between astreoids, space pirates randomly.

I dont take this game seriously either. It is an overrated, fun game which could be used as filler between heavy ones.

Its a great and fun game.
BUT it highly rewards those with good spacial-skills (or rather it severely punishes those without)... and you may find that spacial-skills vary wildly amongst the players in your group; which could kill the fun/social intentions this game potentially offers.

On the other hand, if everyone in your group has an equal (good or bad) skill in this area, it going to be a 10/10 game for you!

It seems that people either love or hate this game the first time they play it. There is alot of luck involved, and some people might feel sour grapes over having been screwed by the game. But its one of the few games where I feel loosing is just as much fun (and utterly hilarious) as winning. It's chaotic, its random, with just the right amount of accountability and skill that you can still get better at the game. As a tile laying mechanic lover, this game also gets a few bonus points from me. Only downside is it doesn't really work as well a two player, although i wish it did.

Hauska(ainakin minusta) aluksen kokoamis ja "tuhoamis" peli. Ensin kootaan kilpaa alus satunnaisista osista ja sitten koitetaan selvitä avaruuden halki joka on täynnä vaaroja. On piraatteja, meteoriitteja ja taistelualueita. koitetaan kertätä matkalta kauppatavaraa ja kuljettaa se perille myytäväksi.

Hauskaa kun sen oikein oivaltaaa!

RATING: 7.5
My rating: (out of five)
Strategy: 3.5
Luck factor: 5 for starters, but experienced players can do pretty well.
Players interaction: Medium, mostly passive.
Play/Wait Ratio: No dead time. Game is simultaneous, and even if you finished early in the building phase, you have the hour glass to speed the other players up. 
Replayability: 3. The building is fun, and different stuff happen in every game, yet it is very random and it might tire you after a while.

Spend a round building a beautiful ship only to have it blown to pieces or just sit out! Things I don't like (in this game as well as others)
- Too many simultaneous options
- Lack of control (of cards, of other players, of dice rolls)
- Fall behind, stay behind

I would be willing to try this game ONE more time, but if given the same experience, would not play again.

RATING: 8
Okay, so some aspects of the game are random but this is way overshadowed by the sheer fun one has playing it.  There are also some neat new mechanics that also make it a nice change of pace.  I think this will be a big hit for younger new players.  I was also very sceptical about having a timer, which I hate in most games, but find it works very well in this game.  There is some pressure to get your ship built but it doesn't lead to total chaos.  Without somekind of timing mechanism I could see some players taking hours to fine tune their ship making the game become way too long for what it is.  As it is, I find it a good mix of presuure, building strategy, and sheer random/luck adventure.

Galaxy trucker is, indeed, loads of fun. Well, it is if flying a spaceship made from sewage pipes through meteor storms and past space pirates and slavers is your idea of fun. Galaxy Trucker is very well-themed (with more than a hint of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) and rather original. The Ship Building part of each of the 3 Rounds resembles Factory Fun. It is where most thought is required and is the heart of the game. The Flights seem to me like an afterthought as your success in the game is largely be determined by your ability to quickly contruct a beautiful, well-armed and fast spaceship. I am a poor spaceship designer and so I have come last in every game I've played - though last time, at least, I made a small profit!

This is what Factory Fun should be.  In a period where many board games are beginning to feel alike (let’s build a castle by impressing the Moat man’s younger cousin), this one is unique and a blast to play (pun intended).

The game is divided into two phases:  Build a ship, where you are racing against the other players to design a ship ala Factory Fun.  Unlike FF though, this is much more chaotic and it is not just an optimization puzzle.  The second phase is to fly your ship and hope you make it till the end.  Sometimes it’s easy and others you will crash and burn.  

The game is definitely built around the first phase with the second being the let’s sit back and see what happens.  Both make the game what it is.  Though it is a little pricey, definitely one you need to try.

Zany fun. A race to build ridiculous space trucks, followed by blowing them to smithereens. Have you ever wanted to do the prestigious job Fry has on Futurama? Well now you can!

But honestly, it doesn't matter, this game is pure fun.

RATING: 8
Even if the theme may not be very catchy (a trucker, really?) the game is excellent. I love it, the mechanics and how it works, and, above all, it is very very fun to play. Another huge advantage of the game is how easy is to explain, there may be some tiles that require further explanation but the idea couldn't be easier: take a tile, decide whether you like it or not, and put it in your ship. Let's see now if you are prepare for the galaxy madness.
I recommend this game to everybody: expert players, new gamers, non-gamers, for a family afternoon when there is nothing else to talk about... Really, I recommend it completely, it should be a must in every gamers' group.
As a summary, some positive and negative aspects of the game:
Positive:
1. Superfun
2. Easy to explain
3. Recommended for every type of player
4. Good duration of the game, usually less than 90 minutes
Negative:
1. The basic game is a bit short on variety, it requires the expansion. The first one at least
2. I don't really like the fact that, for phases 2 and 3, the clock has to switch that many times before activating the end of the building phase (an in-house rule can be applied for this)
3. Many gamers may think that this is a minor game and not the great game it is

RATING: 9
It's a BLAST!
Very refreshing and LOADS of fun.

The Big Expansion is a welcome addition as after a dozen of plays the game becomes too easy and a little too repetitive.  Now (with the expansion) I can play it over and over again...  
Another Big Expansion follows and other goodies.  Yay!! :D
Infinite replayability now.

RATING: 10
Perhaps my favorite board game.  Period.  Perfect combination of skill, luck, and theme.  The fun of the game is watching your hunk of junk struggle to reach the end in one piece coupled with pressuring your slow friends by running down the clock.  Best played with people you're comfortable with in an environment that lets you yell obscenities.  A very social game.

RATING: 7
Pretty cool game although it does have a good bit of that new novelty effect that may wear off as it is so VERY original for now. A FUN game if not taken seriously, the best of all the building race games I have played to date. 

Spatial orientated so spatial people will tend to fair a little better, it's a very well put together game and has great components. 

PROS: 

- Great theme
- VERY original
- FUN
- Great components

CONS: 

- Large random elements
- Limited control
- Very little decision making
- Almost no Strategy (tiny bits in building)
- A little long for weight

Much better than factory fun because of all the added elements here, makes a good gateway game with most rules pretty simple.  Lots of things done right here and not too much wrong, really nothing other than the luck and strategy but this is a game where you are playing for the fun and other elements so it doesn’t detract as much as it otherwise would. Rating may fall a little unless it has staying power as a gateway.

Not my type of game - rush to build ship as quickly as possible, then hope it doesn't get ruined on the luck-fest "journey" you make.

Senseless + minimal control = zero fun for me.

APR10 Reviewing my score after I was talked into playing again by someone who said it was a fun game. 

I just don't get this game at all -  almost completely random, nil-fun, luck-fest.

This game was fun and light. My first playing went a little long but I guess that's to be expected since it takes a little while to understand the tiles and what they do.  

There is a lot of luck in the tiles draws, the card draws, and of course the dice rolls. I don't mind luck in a game and it doesn't bother me in this game either. This is a fantastic and fun little game that I pull out whenever I can.

Very fun, non-serious game.  First a free-for-all grab for tiles to construct your ship.  Then a race to destruction through a gantlet of perils, as your ship falls apart around you.  There is definitely some strategy but mostly it's just harmless fun.  Quick games so makes for a good filler.

This is spectacular with a good-humored group.  The ship-building mechanism is simultaneously great fun and a tactical challenge.  The collective screwage as your creations get obliterated is fun for all.  The only thing that can bring this down is "Super Serious Guy", but he's probably off playing one of the 18XX games instead of Galaxy Trucker anyways.

I love the ship-building puzzle portion of Galaxy Trucker. I'm not as big of a fan of the actual trucking portion. It helps that everyone is more than likely going to endure bad luck, but the feeling of having your ship damaged reminds me of playing with building blocks as a kid: it's fun to knock one's own building down, but not fun when the neighbor kid does it.

Still, it's a unique game that is something I'll certainly play when given the opportunity.

a game of painstakingly building a beautiful ship and then taking it into space where it gets totally trashed.

pretty long for what it is, because you basically play two games each round (up to 4 rounds): build the ship; destroy the ship. each round takes longer, as you have a larger ship and more space to explore.

round 4 is my favorite, as it's usually the one where there's enough competition for pieces that you all screw up during construction. and then you go into space and get super fucked. love it!

I still haven't figured out whether I like this game or not.  I'm kind of leaning towards "not", but I'm sticking with my rating for now.  Trying to build a ship on a time-limit is the part that keeps tripping me up.  I don't like speed games, and that part makes it a speed game. Update: After refusing to play for quite some time, I gave it another go. It's still a speed game. Downgraded.

RATING: 5.3
The 1st half of each round favors the fast thinkers since it's kind of a race to get the best components for your ship.  The 2nd half of each round is just too chaotic... even the best planning in the 1st half can be thrawted by random events for which you can't protect yourself from.  Think I'd rather play Fluxx if I was looking for chaos.

Meh, I'm just not good at speed games like this, and the speed is really just too huge a part of it to ignore and still enjoy. Going last (or almost last) is perpetually frustrating, and not exactly fun.

Edit: After more plays, it is fun, but playing with people who are just way better than you really isn't, and there's a big learning curve. On top of that, there's really not a good way to penalize the good players. Even with the rough road cards, they'll still toast you. I guess the moral is to get good, it's just not that fun when everything always goes to the dogs. Maybe I just mind losing badly too much.

I technically bought the Anniversary Edition, but I like having my expansions listed separately. I am yet to play with any of the expansions, as it seems difficult to get anyone to play the base game enough to move on to something different. My boyfriend hates it, but space-related games are kind of non-starters with him. I feel like I haven't REALLY played the game and don't feel right giving it a 5, but my experience with it has been pretty 'meh'.

RATING: 7
Has ranged from fairly fun to ridiculously hilarious - the latter occurring when everyone's ship gets blown to bits...  I would like it more if it were harder, more often than not my ship gets through relatively unscathed.

The game/laugh quotient here is unmatched.  I may not remember that I killed the pirates, just as I can't remember a thing about my last game of Puerto Rico (other than using a building strategy and coming in 2nd), but I sure as hell will remember forever the evening that I pointed out a very, very weak spot on someone's otherwise well put together ship, only to watch the first die roll on the first card of the round hit that exact weak spot, essentially destroying half of their ship.

Some games of Galaxy Trucker go by with little fanfare or excitement.  If these games were the norm, it'd be a 6, and I would have traded it away given what I paid for it... but the other half of the time?  If you hate rooms full of laughter, you would truly despise this game!

Another hit from Vlaada. What I most like about his games is that they are utterly different than anything I have played before, and Galaxy Trucker, is no exception. 

It is a very fun and innovative game. You have to build your ship and later you have to see how it is blown to pieces. It is a light game but it offers lots and lots of laughs and I love the theme.

Bottom line, Galaxy Trucker is a very solid game, not for constant play but I can see myself playing Galaxy Trucker for a long time.

Almost 5 years since I first played Galaxy Trucker and I still want to play it. Awesome puzzle like game with great production values and it is always fun. I have everything for the game and I plan to play it more with the expansions. It has a great (and funny) rulebook.

Not much else to say about the game. I love it.

I still consider Galaxy Trucker a good and novel game, but I have cooled a bit toward it. I no longer want to play it all the time, but I’m still usually willing to do so. Due to this I´m downgrading its rating.

All the fun of Factory Fun without the frustration.  Perfection is impossible -- no ship long survives contact with pirates, combat zones, and meteor showers in its original state.

After reading all the hype surrounding this game, I thought that it would be at the top of my want list.  After playing once, I've placed it on the 'just no fun for me' list.

The reason?  I'm terrible when it comes to games that require manual dexterity... especially if there's a timer involved.  My old brain just doesn't work that fast... and, no matter how fast I am, someone else is ALWAYS faster!  Probably why I don't like Ligretto/Dutch Blitz or Factory Fun either.

For example: I see a piece that someone else discarded, look at my ship and find a perfect spot for it, reach for the piece... and someone else grabs it!  Over and over and over again!  I end up with a ship built by luck of the draw and limp through round after round, losing part after part because I was unlucky enough not to get that crucial cannon or shield or engine or cargo hold.

Too many random events, little or no planning (if you have no reflexes) turns into no fun for me at all.

If you're 12 years old with lightning reflexes... this game will be one of your favorites.  If you're past your prime like I am, just watch others play and kibbitz... it will definitely be more fun.

If you throw away the timer and change the 'build ship' round to allow sequential moves, it might make it more my kind of game.  But that would probably add an additional hour or more to the play time... and then we're into a whole 'nother problem.

For the time being, I'll give Galaxy Trucker the only rating that fits... a '4' "Not so good but could be talked into it on occasion."

As a side note, I've traded away my copy for Volldampf... I think that I got the better deal.

A very simple, fun and hilarious game! Heard so much about it but hesitated in getting it as i was not sure whether my gaming group will like it, plus the price of this game is not cheap. Then i received it as my birthday present recently and having played it one time, the feeling was absolutely fantastic! The randomness can be hard to handle but not discouraging at all. It is a very unique game that requires a different mindset to play it and enjoy it. Give it a try, you will never know. Excellent effort in board game designing and credits to Vlaada Chvatil!

This game is insanely fun!  Whether playing with first-timers or other experienced pilots, building spaceships only to see them blow up is hilarious.  This is the first game that I scored over a dozen plays within my first week of owning.

So after several games, I've realized that this game is now NO fun with players of varying skill levels.  I've taught the game several times and wipe them clean - no challenge.  Experienced players rarely suffer severe ship carnage and so the fun factor lessens.  The overall rating was lowered to 7 because of this - a 9 with relative skill level and a 5 with newbs.

So, I have played this for the second time.  This game is just so chaotic which makes it unfun as you have no control over anything.  Granted some people like the chaos and that's ok, just not for me.  If I am to play any type of chaotic game it needs to have some sort of controlled chaos, like Carcassone or something like that.

***the more and more I play this game I continue to wish I didn't, absolutely no fulfillment feeling.  Construct ship to hope it randomly doesn't get destroyed.***

This game is about the fun and joy of failing horribly to build a spaceship and then suffering a miserable, horrible death, in space, from the work of your own hands. How you feel about the game will depend on how you cope with that emotionally.

- Die alone, in space.

Cons:
- Die alone, in space.

Rating after 1 play.

I was expecting to see a stepped up version of Factory Fun since you not only get to build your ship but fly it around too. Unfortunately the "trucking" portion of the game is unsatisfying as cards are flipped to determine what events players are going to face and then resolved in player order. You can look at the cards that will come up in the current "trucking" round if you'd like to know what awaits you out in space or you can just build your ship. 

As for the building part of the game players simultaneously flip over tiles in the hopes of finding some that they would like to place into their spaceship. Any unwanted tiles go back face up for others to be able to claim. As long as you find what you want that's great if not throw it back. So being able to look quickly through tiles is important. 

The game just doesn't get me on either count. The race falls flat and the building is nowhere near as exciting as Factory Fun.

The breadth of Chavtil's talent as a designer is most impressive. This one strikes a good balance between challenging play and harrowing chance. Often the odds against your hastily built, shabby little space frieghter seem overwhelming. So when your hapless crew reaches the end of a journey with a few meagre goods in tow, the relief you feel is legitimately earned. I usually don't care for games with timers, as it feels like an artificial way to build game tension, but here I don't mind it as the bulk of the tension comes after the timed segment.

A nearly-perfect game! The tension during the building phase and the various events during the flight phase mesh together very well and create a unique game experience! Vlaada punched us right into our noses with this one!

The only small downside would be the need for a fast play, or better said, if someone is slower that the others, he will probably get far behind in his ship creation...

Este juego es bastante divertido, la verdad es que nunca le digo que no a una partida y algunas veces hasta lo propongo yo mismo. Eso sí, no es un juego para todos los días, porque se acabaría quemando (como todos).

Se le tacha de ser un juego bastante azaroso en el que te quedas mirando como mamporrean tu nave, pero creo que esos comentarios son exagerados.

Personalmente intento hacer una nave compacta y bien equipada, aunque parezca que le falten cosas, y la verdad es que me suele ir muy bien. Durante el viaje tienes que ver si te interesa pararte a por puntos o intentar dar caza al primero, no es que sean muchísimas opciones, pero desde luego tienes algunas opciones que tomar.

This is a funny game, I never turn down a game and sometimes even I suggest it. Notice that it's not an every day game, you would burn it.

It's said this a game with a lot of luck involved on it in which you only see how your ship is smashed but I really think that comments are overdone.

I try to create a small and well balanced ship. It usually looks as an unfinished ship but I use to do a good job. During your trip you should put an eye on landing in a planet for points or maybe try to catch the leader. There are not to much decissions to take but for sure you have some choices.[/color]

This game rocks.  It's great to have in my collection, where it balances other, more heady or strategic options.  
Galaxy trucker is as fun as it is fast, quaint as it is quick, and hilarious as it is hurried.  

If you want the antidote to getting bogged down in serious strategic gameplay where turns last for an eternity and the gravity of every move threatens to overtake your soul, then look to Galaxy Trucker, where your decisions count, but you never fear the repercussions -- you'll be laughing too hard and enjoying yourself too much to worry about it.

RATING: 7
Galaxy Trucker does so many things right there's only one question remaining: will it stand up to repeat play? Put another way, is there a degree of depth underneath this lighthearted romp through space? All the anecdotal evidence indicates that there is.

The game is played in three rounds, each with two halves. First, you build your ship from a common pool of tiles. Second you see how much cargo you can scrounge while warding off space pirates and meteor showers. The fun is all in the ship-building: how many thrusters, lasers, shields, batteries, cargo bays, crewmembers, and alien comrades can you fit? In what proportion? In what configuration? Can you build your dream ship quickly enough? Have other players already grabbed the tile you're hunting for? Should you settle for something less than a marvel of engineering?

The game is undeniably well done. My only reservation is that the game heavily emphasizes high-speed pattern recognition and frantic tile grabbing during the ship-building phase. This is one of those things that many players will have no desire to get better at, and that some players will naturally do well at. You may get some furrowed brows if you have savants and casual players at the same table. 

Update: Never really got off the ground for me. Very well designed, but the frantic tile grab and ship assembly is almost more fun to watch than to participate in.

Very amusing from my first play.  More of an experience game than a strategy game.  Race to draw tiles and build a decent ship - a game driven by connections.  Then you draw cards to see what happens to the ship on its voyage - where there is barely any control at all.

As someone I know likes to say: "More fun than good."

RATING: 7
The best part of the game is putting your ship together in the beggining.  It's sorta lego reminiscent and I find a sense of satisfaction in the problem solving.  However, after that point it becomes more about luck than anything else.  My ship gets hit in the same spot as my buddies over here, the difference is my ship just got split in half and he only lost some batteries.  It's saving grace is that it's ammusing all the same.  
As you watch the remnants the space craft, which you had too much of an emotional attachment too, drift off into space, you turn with a grin as you know it's only a matter of time before some angry dreadnaught cruser or meteor storm turns your friends spaceship into a regurgitated sandwich.

I didn't buy any expansions (yet) since the base set has all the tiles necessary for our family to argue with already. Watching my daughter (22 years) pick up the tiles during spaceship building always reminds me of what a shark does in a feeding frenzy. it's probably why she usually wins! Watching your (my) spaceship being smashed to bits with asteroids is immense fun, Bah Humbug.

Like many others have said, this bears a definite resemblance to Factory Fun.  I like the speed element of the game, which can be a little nerve-wracking as you approach crunch time.  It's not as frustrating as FF though, since there are so many tiles that you have quite a bit of freedom in the setup of your ship/truck.  This half of the game is essentially the strategic part, especially if you look at some of the upcoming cards.

The second part of the game is quite chaotic, showing that you really can't take the game too seriously.  It's fun to see your opponent's ship fall to pieces, fun enough that you don't mind when it happens to you.

The rules are relatively simple and very well laid out - even funny in parts.  I was impressed.  I would say that those that don't like speed games or puzzle games (or especially speed puzzle games), or those that can't stand chaos would definitely not enjoy Galaxy Trucker - it's not for everyone.  My main knock on the game is the play time, though with an experienced group it should get quicker.  There would also be a pretty large gap in performance between new and experienced players that would be hard to bridge.

I think if you have the right group, Galaxy Trucker can be a lot of fun.

Update, 3/15: Traded away now that I own the Anniversary Edition

CHAD?! Where are you? I need some help with game mechanics. (no pun intended, actually). I love phase one: building the ships. Very enjoyable. Therapeutic...like lego. But it always falls apart (again, no pun intended) when we get to the actual play. What am I doing wrong?! Someone please post a good play-through so I can enjoy this beyond phase one. (Oh...and the instructions are pretty funny...just not very good when it comes to phase 2).

A fun little Star Control 2 type boardgame. This game is mainly about racing with others to build your ship up, and then throwing it against the Adventure cards to see if it survives. Some player-aids would've really helped in this game, but I think most people grasped the use of the different tiles in the end. The quirky rule book was well-written and the components were fantastic albeit a little small/fiddly. 

I only wished the Adventures were not so varied. Some Adventures could leave ships devastated, while others were pretty boring with almost no excitement or dangers.

This is fun game. I do not understand why they say that rules are difficult to learn?  I have played this with my Kids (10 and 5 years old) and both can play this well. This is very good family game and same time good for party or nice filler between hard gaming. 

very flexiple because you can play 1-3 turns. 3 turns is long game, but if you are hurry just play 2 or 1

Galaxy trucker is great because it requires utterly different skills (speed, precision) than most other games and then takes the product of that work and pushes it through this horrible gauntlet so see what comes out. You can’t get more flavor than flying through space with our spaceparts held together by pipes, rope and gum while battling space pirates and dodging meteors. Super fun!

We got this game right after Essen via mail order and it is actually numbered; we think it might be part of the original run, something that always delights game collectors like us. Not only is it a great item in our collection, but we actually love playing this game! It can be played on many levels; with our 8 year old, we have played "build the coolest space ship in three minutes" (a great way to familiarize yourself with the component tiles in the set) and we've played it as directed. Our house rules do not use the timer until the next-to-last person has completed their ship; we're not that competitive and haven't played it enough to want to limit ourselves so much by building really crummy ships. Great game with fun game play; I can easily imagine expansions to this one which will be a "must have" for us.

Nice looking game with great components.  The concept sounds fun, but this one fell flat with my group. The first part of the game, ship building, was kind of fun.  However, it lacked the intensity I expected.  

So now that we built these spaceships what do we do with them?  The answer... not much and that is the biggest problem with the game.  The second part of the game largely plays itself.  Flip over the cards and execute the events.  What decisions there are to made are obvious.  In my play there was little of the schadenfreude that the game promised.  Too bad, because I think there was the potential to present players with some interesting choices.

A disappointing game that I would play again if someone really wanted to play and I was feeling generous.

This game was one of the first games I played when I started getting heavy into gaming.  This game can be an excellent, fun, hilarious game but ONLY if you have the right group to play with.  This game is so much more fun if you rush the ship building part and not have a fortress going into the travel step.  The whole point is to have your ship get beat up and see what wreckage you have left to land!  Many times I've played with newer players who simply will not finish their ship until they have as many parts built as possible with no connectors showing and tons of guns and engines.  I will admit that most of my plays have been with players who are new to the game.  The game does not scale well and plays much better with 4 than with 2.  I don't like the first round as the ships are small and you can't do much with them and the cards are simple and basic; meteors usually miss or bounce off, too many open spaces cards, too many planets.  I don't own an expansion and don't feel I necessarily need to.

This is easily one of my all-time favourite games. I really enjoy the chaos and sense of achievement when your Frankenstein of a ship clanks, groaning at every joist, into the final spaceport at the end of each mission. I even enjoy it when my ship disintegrates mid flight after failing to avoid an enormous asteroid. Incredibly fun game to play, with the difficult significantly ramping up with each expansion. There are many ship classes that I'm yet to successfully pilot into port but I still really enjoy each attempt. In addition, when I'm feeling bored I really enjoy putting together my "perfect" ship and taking her out into open space to see how far she can go. The tactile nature of the game and the sense of ownership and achievement of creating the ship add to the experience. What more could I ask for in a game?

Looking greatly forward to when we can use the timer...

Galaxy Trucker is a unique game. You have to build your space ship by grabbing tiles and placing them on your board as fast as you can. Once you are done you find out whether your ship makes it or randomly gets shot to pieces. That's about it. Roughly... If this sounds fun to you, Galaxy Trucker is your game. If it doesn't, well then you'd better move along. For me it totally depends on the mood I'm in whether I fall in the first or the latter category.

This would simply be a generic bad game if you could meticulously construct a ship and then send it out to see if it survives a bunch of random events with no input from the player. Putting the construction in real time was like trying to polish a turd; it still stinks and you just end up with dookie all over your hands. Skip playing the game and just roll D6s to see who gets a higher number. It's more fun than galaxy trucker, and you have more influence on the outcome as well.

Not a bad game at all if you do not mind frantically building your spaceship within a time limit, then watch it being destroyed with not much you can do to stop it. And this is where the game's charm comes in, watching other players' spaceships torn to bits before yours does.

It's hard to build up your ship with the timer running, but you just have to assume that you'll have an imperfect ship. And then embrace the fact that that ship is going to blow up. If you can take joy in the explosion of your hastily-built vehicle, you will like this game.

Arrived in trade 7-2-11.  Wanted this for a long time, just never quite got around to getting it. Am looking forward to trying it out asap.

RATING: 10
Anyone who doesn't love Galaxy Trucker is wrong.

The only thing more fun than the mad rush of building the spaceships is watching them get brutally demolished during the flight.  No matter how carefully you plan, you always end up leaving a weak spot that is only revealed when your ship falls to pieces.  I'm actually a little disappointed when my ship makes it back in good shape.

Galaxy Trucker lives on that perfect borderline where it's not a party game, but it's played for fun rather than competition.  Certainly, there is an element of strategy and everyone is trying to win.  However, unlike hard core strategy games, you will enjoy it just as much whether you win or lose.

A fantastic game that I am always up for a game of if we can find the time to play with all three ships.

A very unique and clever game composed of 2 phases. First, players compete to rapidly construct a space ship from parts (tiles) grabbed from a shared supply. The resulting ships are often of questionable quality due to time constraints and having been crafted from a rapidly depleting supply of tiles. Players next send their ships on a voyage where they are mostly helpless as they watch while they may be cleaved in half by laser fire, left adrift by slavers, or perhaps arrive in first place and pristine condition. This process is repeated three times (with the stakes increasing each time) and the person who has done the best at the end of the third round wins.

I especially enjoy the tension of racing to rapidly construct a viable and legal ship while competing for parts with the other players.  It is also quite entertaining to see how the ships that everyone has created perform (or how they get mangled as the case may be). At first glance there appears to be a lot of luck in this game but it is actually quite the opposite. Players with more skill will build better ships and they will do better consistently.

In fact, the only drawback of this game for me is that it can be brutal for new players against experienced players (or even for experienced players playing with a more experienced group). It is definitely a game of skill and if there is much discrepancy in skill levels, those with less skill can really end up getting rapidly left behind or obliterated each round. This can drastically reduce the fun factor for the less experienced player. Fortunately, the expansion offers a way to mitigate this. It contains new rules designed to make the game even more difficult (such as ‘Rough Road Ahead’). To balance the playing field for new players, you can simply apply these rules only to the experienced players. I've tried this with new players several times now and it really helps to keep the game competitive and fun for everyone.

A very unique and interesting real-time tile placement/ship building game. Not much quite like this, and something that scores highly just because of its uniqueness factor. The game itself is over all too quickly for my liking. The learning curve aside, this one is simple to teach and learn, but very difficult to master. As far as the real-time aspect, I enjoy Space Alert tremendously and it is one of my most favorite games, however, it is not a mechanic that I would want to engage in every single time I play a board game. I tend to play board games to sit back, relax, and think. Unfortunately, there is not much relaxing about Galaxy Trucker. Space Alert's time element does not feel as big of a deal as it is cooperative.

Another game that I wasn’t sure could live up to the hype. Ended up being a very fun space adventure where randomness somewhat exceeds strategy, but the fun factor manages to overcome this otherwise considered (by me) shortcoming.  Once the ships are built, the real fun begins with the different event cards that usually result in parts flying off or crew members jettisoning out into space. In this game, looks don’t matter but finishing the trip with an intact ship is paramount.

There are plenty of games that are fun when you're doing great, but are boring when you're doing poorly. Galaxy Trucker is one of those rare games that are fun every time you play it, even if you're doing poorly, and especially when everyone is in trouble and struggling to make even a single cosmic credit of profit to make that trip worthwhile.
Experience does help in this game, a lot, but with the team play variant, you can pair a seasoned trucker with a newbie and have a more even trip. Or you could use the great (and free) rough road ahead -expansion as a compensation.

Building your spaceship and seeing how it fares is surprisingly amusing. While there's almost no interaction in between players, the game leaves a lot of room for laughs and banter.

Its main drawback is surviving becomes too easy after a few plays, but there's an easy fix for that: add the Big Expansion.

Basically a puzzle game, but a fun one! Build the best space ship and hope it survives the eventful journey with as much goods as possible. The building phase is the more engaging part. The event phase is rather straigthforward. ***** With two bonus cards: Space Billiards and Space Depo (Essen 2007).

It's pretty fun.  Not a real strategic game, it's more about the luck of the draw, how quick you can place tiles, and how well you place them (having redundant connections).  After that, it's really just fate punching you in the face.  It's fun to see the reactions people have to being destroyed though.  haha

Super fun and engaging building phase with players franticly grabbing at tile to get that extra gun! After building you glorious ship you get to point out mistakes in your friend's ships and watch them fall apart. Great fun. 

After building you ship, the game turns into a mind numbing grind for 15-20 minutes, where the game basically plays it self with minimal player intervention. This entirely ruins the game for me. If I actually got to do something interesting with the ship, this would be an amazing game. Unfortunately it just turns in a anticlimactic disappointment.

part 1 :simultaneous puzzle game.
part 2: Watch the effect on some cards on your ships. very few decisions to be made (if you have used the ability to look at the cards in the building phase)


No tough competition. (solo but decisions affect others)

Played only beginner and second ship. So no real test on the ship yet. Managed to be out of round 2 in second game (not enough crew; too few rockets to fight of two slavery attacks after each other.


Update jan 2018

The parts of the game work well together but for me there are too few decisions in the second part.  Overall what kills it for me is the amount of luck in both parts.
For me it feels like bingo. And only a slightly improved version of it.
definately not my type of game. 

Rating from 6 to a 4. 

What probably would work for me is an auction part in the first half. And a few more decisions in the flight phase.  or a fligjt phase that is allready ramdomly determimed before building the ship (and open information)
I really dont like luck .:-)

This is certainly one of my favorite games to date. It's got the space version of Carcassonne tiles, but on a speed time limit. I love the challenge of building a full ship with (hopefully) little to no open connectors. Then whats great is after the building of the ship you have very little "decisions to make", but still enough to keep things interesting. This is a very fun little game!

I can't see ever turning down a game play of Trucker and frankly I have very few complaints... those complaints that I do have are so minor that they're pointless to bring up. Seriously, an adventure game with Euro elements and an abstract puzzle round... I can't come up with anything else that could or should happen to this game. By BGG rating definitions, this is a perfect 10.

A game where you get to modify a space ship.  Score!!!  I need to play this game more and I bet my rating will go up.  I just really like the strategy of figuring out where to keep your cargo, do you drop cargo for crew etc.  Lots of what seem like simple decisions, but they are not.

Holy cow, this one may set a record for the fastest trip from love to ... blah.  This was [b]great[/b] for the first two games: the rulebook does a great job of easing you into the game, those plays were funny & interesting... but now that I know how to play, I don't really [i]want[/i] to; I don't feel like one game's experience will be different than the last's.  I'll build some ships, then we'll draw some cards & roll some dice and see what happens... yeah, let me know how it turns out, because I'll be in the next room doing something interesting.

Maybe if the tiles were all face-up during construction, and the order of the adventure cards were all known?  I don't know.  As it is, this game just falls flat for me, even though it seems in all ways like a great game.

Update: gave to Darin 2012-03-01.

Update: Darin liked it so much he gave it back; we played it & failed again to have a great time.  No idea why this doesn't work for us, as it seems like we should love it.

This is a puzzle-focused experience of a game, meant to be played for the fun and crazy things that happen during the space mission. You can only do your best constructing your ship before sending it off to fall apart.

There are a lot of ways to balance the game for newer players, whether through official game mechanics or by just granting new players extra time to build their ships. This gives everyone a chance to make a ship that might not survive the trip.

Ooh. What a brilliant game this is: first you try to build good-enough spaceship as fast as possible (puzzle) and then it's time to make some money with it. This one is full of risk-management, puzzle and FUN. You don't need expansion for having enough fun, but with that, you can have 5 players...

Rating based on playing the app. Taking the tiles is probably more fun when playing the physical copy, but the fiddliness of the rules/cards makes the 'trips' work better as a video game - and this is really like a video game adapted to board. I think it can be good fun when played with company of people, but too much initial hurdle with the rules (compared to how family-friendly it is otherwise).

Fun once in a while but a bit tedious due to all the factors you have to take into account when building your spaceship and needing to find THE right tile from the pile. The terminus pieces can be hard to find to make your spaceship invulnerable to small meteorites. Maybe my rating will improve once I've played more.

New players are at a distinct disadvantage and if you have new players, try the 4 player team version where a new player is teamed with an experienced one.

One of the rare boardgames involving a "real-time" element that I personally actually enjoy (not a usual real-time fan).  It is best approached as a party-styled strategy racing game.  Tournament players should probably avoid this unless you're okay with card randomness.  The design mechanisms of Galaxy Trucker isn't "off the charts", but the fun factor and enjoyment is out of this world and far, far away.  Who can get there spaceship to the end, and whole, without getting it smashed to smitherines?  Who will win with the most points?  Who will be the best ship?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun game.  Building your ship is drastically different in game terms than sailing your ship, so it almost feels as if you are playing two distinct games.  Although there is a good amount of luck in the game, the better player still seems to win most of the time. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Possibly my favorite Essen '07 release.  While there might not be a tremendous amount of strategy (although I would argue that there is definitely a fair bit in both building a solid spaceship and looking ahead to see what lies ahead for the race), this game is just enjoyable to play.  There is something about picking up tiles and trying to build a well connected and defended ship to send through a hazardous journey.  Its really fun as well to see ships get destroyed as meteorites and laser fire cuts apart ships and connections die and seeing possibly half the ship get separated and destroyed!  (Well, as long as its not your own ship anyways!)  The bits are pretty nice as well!  I would recommend reading through the rules first and playing the full game instead of just jumping in as the rules allow you to do.  The basic game isn't as good as the full game.

As well, I enjoy a slight variant where the third and final journey is even longer with the usual 1 card from deck 1 in each pile, 2 cards from deck 2 in each pile, and 3 cards from deck 3 in each pile.  Makes surviving the trip even more difficult and much more exciting!

THIS GAME REQUIRES THE BIG EXPANSION FOR FULL ENJOYMENT.  I found the base game become fairly rote and dull after 12 plays or so in that I no longer really have to look at the card deck - there seems to be a general concept of what works well overall most times so why bother?  The big expansion takes that away and creates much more pain, angst, and excitement!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun game with the speed round of building the best ship possible while the timer is running out and other players are racing against you to trigger the end of the building phase.  The flight phase of the ship through space has wildly different results depending on the cards drawn; however, this is not a big deal since there are three separate ship building & flight phases.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Just rating the design, its uniqueness and gameplay, I would have to rate this game at least a 9. Very innovative! 
However, I have to admit that I am not a big friend of real-time strategy games - to me, the ship building phase is just too stressful. Another downside is its randomness, although the short playing time makes up for this again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The concept of this game is stellar. Design your own space ship with all kinds of interesting options, then send it out into the universe to face the challenges of the cards, and compete with other players. I should love this. So what's the problem? The part where you design your ship is implemented so horribly, one could risk invoking demonic possession just to describe the process. It's as if someone created a genius game, and let their 10 year old kid make the final design decisions. Okay, maybe not - I hear people do competitive puzzles, and making your ships is similar to this. I just can't help hating that aspect of Galaxy Trucker. I suppose I will play again if coerced, but I would not expect to have a hope of being competitive.

A complete blast...lots of rules...but once or twice around the block and this is pure fun.  We even keep track of who arrives at port with the worst ship.  Phase 1 of the game is a tile building race against time-how effective can you build your ship?  It needs guns, it need engines, it needs protection and storage, it needs living space for the crew and much needed aliens.  Phase 2 is the journey through space where you may encounter planets, pirates, meteors, other ships-how will your ship hold up, what cargo will you find?

RATING: 6
The building of the ship is the most interesting part, the second phase can get really boring, even after the 3rd ship (last time we didn't have part destroyed in the whole game).
But an original concept and pretty fast when you played it before and know what you have to do.

My wife swears a lot when she plays this game. She hates this game. I mean really hates it. To be fair, it is partially my fault. She didn't like the idea of building a ship only to have life (adventure cards) tear it apart. I did not provide clear expectations that this is was was going to happen during the game. Opps!

To her credit, she finished the game.

As for me, I liked it. It reminds me of raising children. You can raise them the best that you can (build the best ship), but sooner or later they have to go into the world and make it on their own (face the adventure cards).

The other reason I like it is because it reminds me of the television series [i]Firefly[/i]. In this series, a small group of adventures move from job to job, scraping by a living delivering cargo, dealing with those make their livings by nefarious means (pirates), all while trying to keep their ship together. Galaxy Trucker follows these ideas fairly closely.

I simply love the building-spaceships-in-panic-mode concept, and then testing your 'design' by fire on the trade runs - whether you win or loose, you are well entertained with this game!

(For some obscure reason, I find myself drifting into a fake aussie accent when playing this)

Components are nice, the ship part tiles could have been a little more durable, but they'll keep - the alliens, crewmembers, battery tokens, and miniature spaceships are all very cute and nicely sculpted

Easily worth the -quite hefty- pricetag

For a cheaper, mostly solo, experience, try the app for IOS and Android

Maybe the lowish rating is due to my play style or whatever, but the ship assembly side of the game is just not suited to my brain - I struggle to get any sort of decent ship together quick enough - maybe this would come with experience, but frankly I'm not sure I am that keen to put the time in when there are other games I would rather play. 

Quite a unique game I suppose, but not really for me.

You cannot care about your ship getting destroyed when playing this game. That's part of the fun.

I love the building your space ship part and then laughing at seeing how things breaking down and how your ship fares through space.

Crazy tile game. We laugh everytime we play it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A unique theme that is evoked as your spaceship slowly falls apart, a good mechanic to avoid AP, and some cool battery and astronaut pieces can all be found in this game.

The spending time to perform actions and actions being resolved in the order of the ships, along with wanting to be the most intact and fastest ship adds meaningful interaction to the game besides a race to complete your spaceship first/to snipe other people's spaceship pieces.

The only major negative is once your ship starts to fall apart, it becomes progressively more likely it will get damaged, although the 3 rounds means you can certainly make a comeback. It's weird that small asteroids only affect you if you have exposed joints, as otherwise you can avoid much of the damage thrown at you.

Be very careful not to have easily exposed weak joints in your ship, as having a large part of your ship fall off at once can be devastating. I took several 4 junction tiles even if I couldn't utiilize the ability just for the sake of ensuring structural integrity.

Played first game with an 11 year old - took some time to explain, then we were off and going.  There was a distinct difference in the quality of ships built, which frustrated the younger player.  We still laughed at pieces blowing off the ships and crew members floating into space!  Not his favorite game, but he said it was fun.

RATING: 6.5
Build, build, build... now sit back and watch all your stuff get destroyed.  A game that can be frustrating for a lot of people for two different reasons.  The 'free for all' grabbing and placing tiles mechanic is not everyone's cup of tea.  Secondly, the frustrating resolution phase of each round might leave some non-gamers feeling pretty violated.  Not for the feint of heart, but a good strategy base with some randomness involved.  Overall, a fun(ish)time, but doesn't quite live up to the hype.

Nice thematic wacky game. It seems in the last few games that it is a bit easy to have a good ship (maybe we are too good? :)). But it is still a great game with some very refreshing mecanisms.

[Update]A truly original game that well deserve its 10. Only real time game that actually works (if you cheat, or do something bad there is a penalty before the Adeventure begins). The bits are awesome.

Adding The Big Expansion to this makes it really more difficult which actually improve the game!

You can't take this game too seriously, otherwise you will hate it. If you play it for fun, with a dash of strategy, you came to the right place. I do have to specify that you can mitigate your luck in 2 ways: you can look at the event cards so you know what's coming (even though you sacrifice build time, and you get to know the cards over a few plays anyway), and as you get better at building.

Build your space ship randomly and maybe under pressure, that mean with limit time.
Then some events will happen and you roll dice.
The ship building without time limit was a nice part of the game, but the game has no replayability, same boring events, for example, i had a game with over 6 meteoric swarm in a row.

I was fairly underwhelmed by this game.  It seems like a lot of very clever mechanics and a lot of really fun thematic elements, but taken as a whole leaves something to be desired.  By and large, not a bad game, but arguably not a real game at all after a certain point.  It's almost as if you get to plan your route through Candyland or Chutes & Ladders, and then you get to see if you make it to the end.

I so wanted to like this game.  I even pre-ordered it but canceled the pre-order when I heard a friend had also pre-ordered it.  I am glad I did.  The game isn't really there.  Everyone just grabs parts for a ship then you turn over cards to see what part of the ship gets blown up.  with 4 players the game was too chaotic I can see it with maybe two players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game starts with the collection of tiles to build a spaceship.  Once the ship is assembled, you then go off and travel to other planets where you gather resources to deliver to other planets.  You can be attacked by aliens or evade asteroids.  Your ship is damaged along the way and can be destroyed unless you have adequate defenses.  It is reasonably fun, but it is tough in that there is a timed puzzle element to assembling your ship.  If you don't like putting together a puzzle under a timer, you may not like this game.

RATING: 7.75
A fun game about space ships cobbled together from junk yard pieces. Pretty unique and different from most other games I know. 

The game is played in two phases. Phase 1: build a ship. Phase 2: watch it fall apart.

1) All players simultaneously build their space ship by laying tiles on their personal board: cockpits, cargo holds, engines, canons, shields, alien life support, etc.

2) The players undertake a long journey. The cards in an event pile are flipped one by one. The ships all get to pick up merchandises if they can afford to, but they will also encounter pirates, smugglers, corrosive star dust and meteorites. The ships slowly fall apart into pieces as they are hit by meteorites and enemy attacks. The cards affect the players in order, according to a time track that is updated when players suffer delays or make use of their engines: the first player gets first pick on the merchandises, but is also the pirates' first target!

Once all event cards have been played and their effect applied, the players have arrived to their destination! Any merchandises which were not lost along the way can be sold for victory points. Players also have to pay a penalty for any ship equipment that was damaged during the trip, and receive bonuses depending on their place on the time track, and the state of their ship. There is no penalty for deceased crew members or lost alien passengers.

No doubt this is a fun game. However, it can't get a score higher than 7 because of its replay value. You're going to face similar events over and over again, the only difference being the sequence only. And the funniest part is not scoring more than your opponents, but watching your/ opponents' ships fall apart, which can't provide the same amount of humour the second time you saw. Very fun if played rarely like once per year, not a keeper.

A cautious preliminary rating of 7 - gotta play more to know where this ends.

Update:
It's way random, but gets more and more fun none the less, the more I play it.
The rulebook should be rewritten - there is so much flavortext interweaved, that it makes it hard to discern the actual rules.

Upgraded to 8:
It's almost completely random who wins, but the gameplay is so fun, that it doesn't matter :o)
I expect to play this a lot more.

Up to 9:
It seems to stay fun forever.

RATING: 7
Very fun game about building a ship, and then watching in horror as all your plans swirl down the bowl as your creation is slowly or instantly destroyed by the adventure cards.  Despite not having a lot of strategy, basically being pretty colors and pieces, it's still a lot of fun.  Because the flights go relatively quickly, the destroying part of seeing what's happening to your and your friends' ships doesn't detract too much from the fun of building the ship.

Figure without this being very deep, rather just a fun romp, I would gladly use this to introduce new players or people that just don't want to think too much to a fun game.  But there's also other options to fill that niche, options that would also have a little deeper gameplay that could also fill my personal tastes.

Traded Zombicide to a guy in Canada for this and its first expansion.

Not really a deeply strategic game, but certainly a whole lot of fun. You frantically try to build a ship, and then watch as it gets ripped apart. There's a lot of randomness here, which makes forming a strategy difficult, but that just makes it better for those times when you want fun first and thinking second. If you can trust kids with the smaller pieces, this makes a great family game.

Very nice game, the ship building part is quite fun, and the race itself is a nice bonus phase really. It can easily be stopped after a single round, or continued a few extra rounds. Definitely a game I'd like to play again. (2011-10-22)

Nice replayability, Expansion would be nice for 5 players, and to get more tiles. (2012-01-04)

It's a light and quite random, but it is engaging to try to build the best ship and intriguing to see how it fares in the several events along the way. 
Must be played with a light heart (despite some possible tactical variants and thus tactical choices, randomness will still rule... this is not bad per se, as long as you are expecting it! Otherwise you're only going to be frustrated.).
Nice rulebook.

I don't give out high marks easily, but this game is spectacular. I'd readily give it a 10, but there's far too much luck involved andar  too little strategy. That being said, if you don't take it too seriously, the game can be the epitome of what you could desire out of it - a supremely fun game that I truly don't play enough. In summation, 8/10 for my tastes; 10/10 for what it is

Build your own spaceship from sewer pipes and fly through various encounters! This game is a real blast and you can determine how many rounds (how long) to play. Each consequent round is more longer and more fun of course as the encounters get worse. I just love the balance of stress and fun in this game; first you stress as you try to build as quick as possible and once everyone is finished and the adventure starts it's a real blast to see other's (and your's as well) ships get torn into million pieces.

Previous experience helps a lot in the game, but there are variants in expansions that can be used to mitigate this.

This feels like two games in one.  The first half you are racing to build a spaceship with cargo bays, lasers, engines, batteries, and places for your astronauts.  The second half you are taking your ship into flight and hoping it holds up enough to reach the destination.  It is a really fun and hectic game and you just hope your ship doesn't fall apart as its being slammed by asteroids and shot at by fighter ships.  Tons of fun.

Really cool and different game mechanic - you dump common tiles into the center of the table and then players in real time race to build their ships in the most economical way; but if you don't do a good job, you'll be blown to bits as the game advances (and there are attacks, asteroid hits, etc).  Only played this game once but thought it was really different and cool.  Some people don't like the real time element since it makes it too stressful, but I personally think that makes it fun, different, and creative.  Vlaada rules.

I'm probably being to harsh on this one, but I had a bad first impression. In my haste to build a ship, I created a weak point in the middle. Once the game started, an asteroid smashed my ship directly in the weak point and broke off half of my ship away. For the rest of the round, my ship got hammered into smaller and smaller bits. 

It was not a fun experience. BUT, it was a first go. To be fair, I should try again at some point.

Oh so nearly perfectly awesome.  Why oh why must you be timed?  Galaxy Trucker, we were almost fated as a perfect match, but woe, it was not to be.  I cannot change you, it is in the nature of your mechanic and I cannot change that without also loosing what makes you great.  We can still go out for coffee now and again, but I'm afraid things will just have to stop there.

From an 8 to 4. I like this game but without having a solid understanding of all the different ship components, I usually get mopped up with this game. I think after many plays, and learning how to build better ships, the rating will improve. Steep learning curve for me.

RATING: 7.9
The game centers around a comical and well executed theme that carries through the game. The game feels a bit brutal on your scrap-built ship, but its not deveasting and its more comical than harsh to travel to your destination. Its great fun to see the ships each other builds and there is also a great level strategy to decide upon while you're building your ship; do I really want to be out front and have frist swipe at the goods or let the lead ships take on the hard attacks? 
The game might loose a little luster with additional games, so only time will tell.

A delicious dish of frantic building, a cruel hope that this trip might turn out not to be that bad, after all, and the pure, unadulterated fun of seeing complicated stuff get mashed up by rigid things.

Do not play this game with a perfectionist. This person will insist that you discard the timer and let them always build the perfect ship. So while you're trying to have fun and laugh, they are sitting there for twenty minutes on a Class II ship trying to find just the perfect piece. Then they get sullen when anything bad happens to them. 

Play this game only with people who get a kick out of just having a hilarious time and not taking much very seriously. Then you will have a rockin' good time, it's super duper fun.

The one word to describe this game is "fun."  It is simply a blast to play.  Its not forgiving to new players, but even after players I've introduced to the game get crushed, they still want to play again.

Unfortunately, I haven't played it yet with four players of the same skill level.  Every time, there has been someone new--so although its still great fun, you can usually count on the newbie taking all the flak from the combat zones and such.  I also look forward to playing with the expansion, which should mix things up quite a bit.

A lot of fun. We played this game one night and had a blast. Too bad it was my 1st time and the 1st time for 2 more people. You have to train a little before matching an experienced player.

There is also theme in this game, since you can have 1/3 of your ship being torn apart by a well placed meteor just because you didn't (or didn't have time to) establish a good defense system to prevent the damage.

Scrambling against other players to assemble a truck from limited parts, balancing all the need and finding the right placement, and then survive the flight is great fun.

Join the convoy and head across the Galaxy in search of riches and adventure. I wasn't sure at first, but this has quickly become one of my favourite games. You spend about 2/3s the the game "building" your ship and the 1/3 traveling through space. There are many obstacles to over come, such as meteors, space-pirates, slavers, galactic viruses, and even open space. 
Be cautious while building your ship, to many laser and you will sacrifice cargo space, not enough and you can't fend off dangers.
In truth if you finish the game with a positive dollar amount you have won. Of course there may be others who have more, but I have had at least one game where I didn't even get to finish.

Like my son pointed out, I build spaceships in real life, so I was bound to like this one! :-) And I do, even though realtime games aren't normally my thing. (There isn't too much realtime pressure in this one.) The voyages provide a narrative that's entertaining, and there is a lot of cheering & groaning going on by all truckers. Another good sign. The only downside is that this is kind of a computer game done in boardgame format. By that I mean that the cards & dierolls, even the pieces knocked off your ship are "cardboard technology" for processing steps that a computer or videogame does so effortlessly. You see this more in 1970s and 1980s wargames, and here it is in a modern Euro boardgame.

RATING: 9
Galaxy Trucker is everything I wanted it to be: pure, chaotic fun, and fun even as you watch your shoddily built spaceship fall apart after mishap after mishap. I lost my first game, but had a blast losing -- a hallmark of a great game.

I love that GT is unlike any other game I've ever played. I usually hate real-time games, but the timer system is so well-implemented that it just works perfectly. The change in tone from fun, tense chaos during construction to "Aaaargh!" (but fun) during the flight is also neat, and I like that every game gives you three cracks at building a decent ship.

Toss in the fantastic components I expect from CGE, and this is one hell of a cool package.

My group had mixed reactions to switching from the basic rules to the full rules for round two; one player in particular really hated the game after that. I like the full rules, many of which look like they'll shine after a few runs when you know what you're doing.

A rather niche game. I guess Vlaada likes to be cute and funny in his rulebooks, but it was a chore to get through this one. Mechanics are fine, but the speed element requires a certain crowd to enjoy it. I find Galaxy Trucker to be polorizing, it's either a hit or a miss.

RATING: 9
Great tile-based adventure game.  I would not recommend the game for two players, but I would recommend it for small groups of people that have a great sense of humor, and don't mind having their ships blown in half.

I've rated this a 9, but I do not think the base game by itself deserves that.  When combined with The Big Expansion, this game becomes one of my favorites.  The expansion is a must-have because it adds more variability to every aspect of the game: more ships, more encounters, more components, more aliens, and even more game modes.  The best expansion I've ever bought. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
3 / 5 - Good.

Absolute lunacy but highly entertaining. The fairly unique "grab a component" gameplay of ship building does an excellent job of being stressful, brain-burning and enormous laugh-out-load fun all at the same time. The journey afterward is more sedate - sometimes all hell breaks loose and it's great, sometimes no-one interacts with most of the cards and it's a bit dull. The accounting phase right at the end is needlessly fiddly, would benefit from a bit more interaction (but I'm not buying the expansion for the machination cards alone!), and the fact only one person at a time can run through the adventure cards is a shame but these are small blips.

2nd best game of 2007 and one of my favorites.
Unique game with very little downtime, you'll be having fun from beginning (frantic speedbuilding phase) to the end (see how badly your ship will suffer). Replayability is decent with basegame and great with expansions. The expansion tiles can be hard to teach to newbies though, so it suffers a little from same problem as Space Alert.. best fun will be had with players of same skill level who explore the game together. Still it's a 10. It's a classic.

Really wanted to like this game; I generally love games where you have to build things up to watch them get beat down.

Lots of fun.  Hard with two because there is very little jockeying for position and ship building is the real determining factor.  Takes at least a game to learn all the tiles and how to use them.

The complexity is spot on with no redundant part of the game. There are a few component types more than you'll ever realistically have space to build so your truck will definitely be bad at something, just hope it doesn't come up!

In this game, players simultaneously flip over tiles showing ship components and add them to their ship to create the ship most likely to survive the challenges of deep space travel with the most goods/rewards, then watch together as event cards are flipped that reward players with the most guns/people/rockets, or threaten to destroy your ship before the paint has even dried.
Despite the hype, I don't care for this game, and for several reasons. First, players familiar with the game have a huge advantage in anticipating events (based on their unbalanced knowledge of the event cards) and building a more appropriate ship (based on their unbalance knowledge of the tiles) that survives the event cards and reaps better rewards than players who are not familiar with the cards and tiles. This leads to my second complaint, which is that this game suffers from "get in the lead, stay in the lead" syndrome. If you fall behind or get one (or more) stroke of bad luck, you are done. I got hit with "stardust" in rounds 2 & 3 (solely because I was unaware of this card and its consequences), which moves you back 1 space for each exposed connection, and moved back about 10 spaces and out of competetition both of the last 2 rounds... nobody could even pretend that I had a chance. So, for 2/3 of the game I had to sit back and watch the others play as I could not even dream of competing, but yet I continued to also suffer negative consequences of some of the event cards, thus adding insult to injury. I felt like a Galaxy Trucker pinata. If I had been eliminated from the game entirely, I may have maintained a shred of dignity. But alas, the game refused to release it's death grip on me and I was forced to continue "playing", if you could call it that. 
A game that can do that to a player and end with scores ranging from 99 to 0 (which ours did) is broken.
I don't mind games with player elimination... I just want to know ahead of time that that is a risk in the game.

This was a fun little game.  I think that the more you play the better idea you have on how to build your ship, but even then the luck of finding what you want fast enough can hinder you.  

Confirmed I did much better my second game.  Won by a nice margin... although I'm sure luck played some factor there. :D

Amazing game with the right group. I've had it fall flat with some experienced gamers. I think they weren't in the mood for puzzle/chaos and just laughing at the destructive and incomplete results. It is certainly unique, and a breath of fresh air for what it is.

I really wanted to like this game as I like the designer. I also like spatial games even though I am terrible at them. This game is just not fun. Building a ship with random pieces, while not terribly horrific just feels like putting together a puzzle. The second half of the game, you just sit back and watch it play itself. Nope, not when I can play Dungeon Petz! Edit: Donated it for the Jack Vassel Foundation Holiday Fundraiser 2012

Excellent game!  Even though it is very frustrating to have the timer turned on you by your opponents and even more frustrating to watch your ship fall apart, there is something satisfying about each round.

It is really good to know that someone who can make a masterpiece like Through the Ages can make another game which blends theme and mechanics so well.  Galaxy Trucker is a neat game.  Sure, there is luck in the adventure phase.  So what.  This game is fun and looks great.  After four plays, however, I am getting luke warm on it.  It would be nice to have more variety in the card and tile mix.  Perhaps the expansions help in this regard?

Hmm, not my kind of game. It don't like the time pressure and the theme doesn't appeal to me either.

For a "multi-player" game, there was very minimal interaction, but it was very funny though, kind of like "Sim City In Space" as you watch your creation destroyed through a story arc of sorts.

Fun quirky spacerace game. Despite the light feel and strokes of luck (the dicerolls for the bad events) it's always fun to see other players spaceships being blown to pieces while you barely hang on...

Good fun here.  A two-part game of prepping your ship, then taking it through a space ride.

Simple and easy for most, but experienced players will have a big advantage.

Rules are a little corny, but OK.

We play without being able to look at the adventure cards ahead of time.  I think it's more fun in the card reveals, but it does increase the random factor a bit, as far as constructing your ship (you have to be prepared for anything.)  I might try revealing maybe 1/3-1/2 of the adventure cards before ship assembly (just face up for everyone) to see if that skews fighting over certain ship components.  More in-fighting is good.  :-)

The space trips can be very anti-climatic or incredibly brutal.  I've seen how someone could initially be really bored or really frustrated.

So, a good, fun, light game with not a lot of player interaction and game depth.  High sugar content, but not long lasting nourishment.

RATING: 7
Game in a Nutshell: Race to grab pieces from the junk-tile pile to piece together a ship. When time runs out fly your ship across the galaxy and see if it holds up to the random card events along the way.

Played as: 2,4 player

Pros: Nice sturdy game with a fun look and conceptual-draw to it. The building part of the game is the main draw and shines more with a greater number of players as parts are more tightly contested and grabbing can become fiercely competitive. A unique experience for sure.

Cons: I really wanted more player interaction. Instead this game brings an attitude of wanting to live in my own little world only to have it become annoying when others invade it. The flying of the ships is slow and clunky compared to the excitement of building. While not essential, it would be nice to feel like I was piloting the ship more, but really it felt closer to slowly going along for the ride. There's a juxtaposition in the game in that I believe it's supposed to be taken lightheartedly but still has a scrappy competitive nature. I believe that sets some people off as it's hard to watch all your tightly contested effort flutter away into inevitability. Plus some people just suck at building ships. It's hard to explain to beginners "sorry your ship sucked too bad and is un-flyable at this point, so you'll have to sit and watch for the rest of this round" and expect them to want to continue playing.

Other: Chalk me up as another person who really wanted to love this game (and still do) but came up a little disappointed so far. It just didn't hold the tension I wanted eather in games with less players or during the flying portion period. It's certainly unique enough that I'd be happy to explore the game more and may change my tune over-time.

Best Use: Non-competitive players and uncompromising control-freaks need not apply. Better with more players.

RATING: 8
One of my gateway games. There is a lot of luck in this game with the events and it does feel like you are just grabbing for pieces and throwing your ship into space. I do hate the fact that I am very slow in grabbing tiles. I have one friend that grabs all the engines/missiles and the other that grabs all the batteries/missiles, so I feel that your ship can suffer from this. You could view what events are coming to counter the randomness. Only reason I am giving this game a 7 is because of the dexterity needed to grab tiles as fast as possible, though the rating could go up if I give the game a few more plays and find a way to counter the players I play against.

I just don't like this game much, and I don't understand it's popularity.  My first experience was frustrating due to rushed teaching, but I've had several opportunities to play since and I've declined every time.  I feel like it's a mechanism in search of a game, and I don't find the mechanism terribly compelling.  If I want to play a puzzle game (and I love puzzle games), I'd rather play something better.  I should try it again, and honestly shouldn't rate it with only 1 full play though I've played it partially on two other occasions.

I like this game but my wife does not.  Plays very different than other games we own because it has speed component when you are designing your ship.  She likes to have time to deliberate on every move, so building a ship as fast as you can with the components rapidly getting depleted just frazzles her.  It is very exciting when you are able to put together a sound ship.  Sometimes you mess up and have a weak structure, and a single asteroid or pirate attack can blast off a huge section of your ship.  If I lived closer to Randy I would get to play this more. 

Edited for IOS version:
Score goes up with the IOS version.  I love the campaign mode.  I am absolutely horrible at this game, but it is just so much fun, even when you don't make any credits and your ship gets blown to pieces.  Plus, you don't need to be the best to finish the mission.

"This piece does this" x 25.  Also, special placement rules x 20.  Rules overload.  

Admittingly, my first game included 2 expansion packs, so there were more tiles, but enough already.  Too many little rules, and the cards and play order were confusing.  Also, too much luck regarding card order (why do people play without looking to see what's coming up that round?) and dice rolls.  And it doesn't seem to have much actual strategy - from what I could tell, people will normally just try to build the same generic ship each time.  I ended the 5p game with -2 points, compared to the winner's 120 and the runner-up's 89 (I kept messing up placement rules each round, which resulted in 80% of my ship being destroyed before the first card reveal).

The concept of this game is really appealing, but the actual gameplay leaves something to be desired.  FYI - I have never tried any of the expansions.

The second phase of the game, in which the players test out their ships, seems to drag on too long...

Also, in our experience, this is not a good gateway game.  The rules & flow of the game are slightly clunky - we have had challenges getting non-gamers to finish the game.

Somehow manages to combine two of my most hated mechanics, spatial perception and plain dumb luck, into a cohesive and fairly pleasant package. Does take a bit long for what it is (I'd rather just run the last two races), but the game is mostly engaging if you take it for what it is. Definitely some skills involved in building the stupid ship, but the luck (or lack thereof) of the dice can just be crippling regardless.

Chaotic game that's sorta fun but a lot of frustrating.  I can see that a lot of people really dig this game but it didn't seem to mesh with how my brain works to well.  I understood what was going on but couldn't compete.  There's basically two parts to the game: 1) build a ship 2) survive adventure through space trying to collect the most income.

The first part of the game is much like Factory Fun.  There are a ton of tiles turned face down and you frantically pull tiles and try to add them to your ship in a reasonable way.  These include shields, cabins for crew, lasers and power supplies.  There are placement rules and I had a tough time remembering them all.  Also, I'm just not to quick when it comes to optimizing for an adventure I know nothing about.

After the ship-building phase you venture off to space.  Cards are flipped and something happens.  Depending on how your ship is built you get points or parts of your ship are blown to pieces.  The second part of the game is virtually programmed by the first part so just sit back and cross your fingers.

This is pretty much what I expected, but that's not a bad thing. I really like the concept, enjoyed it, and would play again. I prefer [gameid=24417] by a smidge, but I can see why someone might rank them the other way. (However I can't see how this is top 50.)

The three races thing... does not make a lot of sense to me. If you don't carry anything over from one race to the next, why does a game consist of three races? [gameid=50] this is not - and I don't like that gimmick there either. But here, the third race is really long. I think I would just consider board two the base game, and play two or three rounds of that. Or one of the long race.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/617350/im-so-glad-i-got-insurance]Galaxy Trucker Review: I'm so glad I got insurance[/url]

I really enjoy playing this, I just wish I could get it to the table more often.  I think the biggest thing affecting that is that I got several other good games right at the same time as this one.

My favorite part of Galaxy trucker is the first phase.  The game is played in 3 rounds, each round your ships get bigger, the flight is longer, and the danger (as well as rewards) is greater.  The first phase is where you build your ship.  There are a bunch of tiles containing the parts to use for your ship in the middle of the table, and it is an all out free-for-all as people grab parts and build their ships.  You need cabins for crew, canons to shoot with, shields for defense, cargo holds for goods, batteries to power, rockets to fly, etc.

After your ship has been built it is time to inspect it.  If you have parts that weren't connected properly those places have to come off, and you can't replace them.  You also get penalized at the end of the flight for these parts.

After inspection it is time to fly.  The randomly drawn cards determine what will happen on the flight.  Pirates might attack (leaving you loot if you can beat them), meteors will strike, there will be planets to trade with, combat zones, etc.  If you have built your ship well you should survive and come back with a lot of cargo on hand, but if you built your ship poorly it can be blown to bits, with cargo floating off into space, crew members being left behind, etc.

On return you are awarded money based on what order you came back, the "best looking" ship will get some bonus points, and everybody gets paid for the cargo they have.  Of course the worst part is paying back the company for all those parts that got blown off during the flight.

I gave this game a 7 mostly because of the randomness to it.  I generally don't like random elements, but it is so much fun to build your ship that it overcomes the randomness.  Also, while building, you can see 3/4ths of the cards that will be in the flight, so that helps you build your ship in a way that maximizes your points.  This isn't a serious game that will get those hard core gamers excited, but it is a lot of fun to play and I wouldn't get rid of this one.

I like how there is almost ZERO downtime.  You can never catch your breath really.  It is both fun and frustrating to see your ship fall apart as once it is built you have very little control of what happens.  After awhile you get really good at building a ship...guess I need the "harder" expansions.  New players are at a severe disdvantage and while there are rules about swapping built ships, we haven't done it.

RATING: 8
Cool game, fun concept, lots of entertainment to be had here. Perhaps lacking a bit in player interaction, and suffers from the usual Euro thing of players causing you to lose points through no fault of your own, but this is a killer game and I would be way more excited about Euro gaming if this was the kind of thing that was getting churned out rather than the more tedious "heavy" games that BGG is so in awe of.

RATING: 6.5
Played once. The game lasts for three rounds; at the start of each round players build a ship that they hope can survive the numerous negative events that get thrown at them later in the round. 

I find the ship building element of this game to be very stressful: a number of possible ship tiles are placed upside down on the table, and then all players simultaneously select tiles to add to their ship. When doing this, players must choose one tile at a time, turn it over and look at the tile and decide whether they want in their ship. If they do want the tile in their ship, they must immediately place into their ship, and this placement is permanent. If they don't want it in their ship, they must place it face up on the board, so that any other player may take it (or they may take it later too). Complicating matters are that the tiles must connect to all other tiles, and of course all the tiles don't actually make legal connections to each other. Given that this ship construction is limited in time by other players (once one player is finished all other players have a minute left). I find it difficult to make the best decisions, and often find myself making mistakes (e.g. thinking that I have two pieces that interconnect, but they don't actually). Given that making the wrong connections or having sub optimal ships is punished harshly, this gets frustrating.

Once the ships are built, the game turns into a giant round of somewhat random "take that." Players turn over cards that have some good events (getting cargo, which gives you victory points), but which more than likely are negative events (getting attacked, etc.).  Negative events can be extraordinarily harsh, leading to the destruction of large parts of your ship (which can create a positive feedback cycle that leads to very negative scores and players being eliminated from the round).  Players do have the ability to look at some of these cards while building their ships, but given that ship construction was so stressful I never found myself able to do this.

There is also no shortage of rules, which ends up slowing down the gameplay significantly (as players try to figure out exactly how various cards are resolved or specific damage to a ship is dealt with).

If this game took less than an hour to play, the above frustrations (stressful ship construction, overly complicated rules, possibility of elimination, and random "take that" mechanics) would be fine, but it takes multiple hours to fight through all of it.  

I'd be willing to try this again, but unless it speeds up significantly I don't foresee this game being worth investing the hours to play it each time.

[update: After thinking about the game more, I wonder if simply removing the time limit on ship construction might help the game a lot.  You'd still have the stress of missing out on good ship parts (as other players picked them), so would want to go fast, but wouldn't be worried about being screwed by time.]

I enjoy Galaxy Trucker and appreciate the sci-fi theme.  The real-time element has caused much grief for players I have introduced to the game.  They have been very discouraged by their ships falling apart, especially when they have missed something in the design stage and have not even launched yet.  This game is not for everyone, particularly people who are easily discouraged.

In Galaxy Trucker, players construct a spaceship out of randomly assorted parts, including lasers, engines, and cabins. Then, players take their ships on space adventures, which will likely end up in the ships getting destroyed. (Which is often hilarious.)

I love this game, but it's messy. There are a lot of moving parts, and it can be confusing. That being said, if you're up for a silly game, Galaxy Trucker can certainly fill that role.

The ship-building is great fun, although it's the only part of the game that you have any great deal of control over.

Galaxy Trucker is a thrilling adventure:  first, you outfit your ship in a hectic, real-time race against other players and a sand-timer.  Then you captain your hastily-built masterpiece through the chaotic and hostile depths of the galaxy - where it is bombarded by asteroids, boarded by pirates and slavers, caught in the crossfire of cosmic warfare, plagued by space dust and subject to all kinds of abuse.  Also along the way you visit unknown planets, pick up and trade exotic trade goods, explore abandoned ships and starports and cruise the milky way!   Both parts of the game are funny and cinematic.  This game is great fun in it's own oddball way -- which is neither strategic nor tactical.

+2 The 'racing to build a ship' mechanic is novel, adds a 'skill' element, and is very fun. 

+1 Timer/die/events all add different levels of tension. Makes the game feel varied and eventful. 

+1 Limited batteries/event cards allow for some meaningful decisions post-launch. Adds a layer of strategy over the skill-elements. Feels like you can affect your fate. A little.  

+.5 Light, playful theme done well - but it's not built into the mechanics. Could reskin this as a boat game/cowboy game/post-apoc game and it would play the same. 

+.5 Lots of stuff in the box, for the price. But, components aren't amazing. Wood blocks for cargo, crew are one step up from meeple. I like the energy pips though, and the ship boards are nice. 

+.5 accessible for beginners, despite it taking a while to teach. 

-.5 limited player interaction... but cards introduce some. 

-.5 Dying randomly, suddenly and without recourse is par for the course. Mitigated by rounds and light theme though. 

-.5 Artwork is mostly functional but 'plain'... Cartoony style + open ended dramatic theme = lots of untapped potential for cool art. 

-.5 perfectionists/power-gamers tend to hate the 'Inevitability imperfect ship'. Builds tension but drives some players insane. 

-5. Heavy enough game. Lots of components, setup and a "Takes a play-through to 'get' it" learning curve. Rewards with strategy, but not a disproportionate amount. 

-.5 Rule book. Tutorial style. OK for first play-through, bad for reference. includes flavor text among rule explanations - so needlessly confusing at times it seems deliberate. 

-1 3 rounds can get repetitive. More could've been done to provide variety (e.g. themed instead of graded decks) 

A fun, fast, frantic game with lots of nail biting and catastrophic losses... once you get past the learning curve.

Mit Galaxy Trucker geht es ab in den Weltraum, denn die Spieler verkörpern 8wie der Name schon sagt), waschechte Weltraum-Frachtführer. Doch dafür benötigt man zuerst einmal ein Raumschiff. In Echtzeit müssen die Spieler aus den verschiedensten Teilen, ihr Raumschiff zusammen stellen. Dabei gibt es unglaublich viel zu beachten: Laserwaffen schützen gegen Piraten, Schilde gegen Meteoriten, ein schneller Antrieb kann auch nicht schaden und die Crew braucht natürlich auch Platz..achja und bei einem Transportschiff sollte auch genügend Frachtraum zur Verfügung stehen. In der zweiten Phase muss sich das soeben zusammen gebaute Schiff dann beweisen und gegen allerlei Widrichkeiten bestehen. Am Ende jeder Runde gibt es dann Siegpunkte. Galaxy Trucker macht eine Menge Spaß, wenn man auf das Echtzeit-Raumschiff-Bauen abfährt. Ich hatte auch schon Spieler dabei, die mit dieser mechanik absolut nichts anfangen konnten. Denn Abseits davon, hat Galaxy Trucker keinen taktischen Tiefgang. Alles weitere ist nämlich dem Zufall überlassen. Trotzdem ein spaßiges Spiel.

Great game for about 3-4 plays.  After that you've experienced all you're ever going to with the base game (the expansions may help add some longevity).  There is only so many times you can build a spaceship before you play it on autopilot.  The game is also in my opinion one round too long meaning it can sometimes drag on.  Especially when it soon becomes clear who's going to win. 

Great idea that is executed very well.  Unfortunately there's just not enough game here to keep me coming back to it.  The app is better and plays in a fraction of the time.

The learning curve can be a little steep, especially if you try to play with the expansion tiles right away. Once that's down, it's crazy fun AS LONG AS the people playing can laugh at having the ships they've just made being torn apart in the second half of the round. This drives some players straight from loving this came to hating it. Some hate the second part so much, they won't even play it. Go in with the right attitude, and you'll have a blast.

I can see from the thematic point of view why so many people might enjoy this, and I do enjoy the theme and idea immensely. Just a shame it feels like I could play it 100 times and still never get any better at it then the people that are already 50 games ahead of me.

What does it feel like when I play? Rush to blindly grab the ship pieces with everyone else and cobble them together as quickly as possible so you aren't left with 1/8th of a ship when the better players have finished, then sit and watch the game play itself  for 20 minutes. Repeat two more times.

I feel like every element of GT is completely out of my control, and as a result often finish each session with a sensation of mental frustration and stress.

It also has the worst kind of player elimination- one where rather then you being out and out you must still continue to play, even though both you and all other players know that the best possible comeback will not catch you back up.

One of its best saving features is that one of its copious expansions has made handicapped boards for more experienced players as a way of equaling the balance between them and less experienced- this has saved the game for me, as I can now play and enjoy GT much more against the owners of the game and still feel like I actually have a chance of winning!

I love the theme and idea, but its damn frustrating!

Additional note- the mobile device version of Galaxy Trucker is an incredible implementation of the board game. It introduces alternative play styles and a single player campaign. Its very addictive and has vastly improved my attitude towards this game!

Galaxy trucker has a minor problem. The game itself is not very exciting. You build a ship and race a course. What is exiting is seeing your ship (and your enemies ships) being torn appart. The most fun we had, was when we got annihilated.

I love the shipbuilding phase of this game. Flying the ship through various perils is also fun, but I feel a bit disappointed the adventures are so repetitive--in the base game, the same half-dozen events occur over and over again. It's a flaw maybe more apparent when playing the phone app version repeatedly? Still, a unique and marvelous game.

RATING: 6
I don't understand all the hype to this game.  You build a ship as quick as you can and then watch helplessly as it gets destroyed.

Many players do get destroyed or lose too many people and are then forced out of the round.  If knocked out early it can be a long wait as the round plays out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
WHATever!  A multiplayer Starship Catan without that game's elegance or finesse.  I think I'd like it more if the building phase actually had an impact on the game.  All too often, it doesn't.  Nor does it feel that there's an actual unique galaxy that the game has created for you.  Just the usual set of random encounters.  Speaking of random, I don't mind luck and a high degree of randomosity.  But then the game needs to be short and sweet, and this one is not.  It really seems more a gimmick game than anything else.

I sucked in my first game but it was fun. The downtime is almost zero, helped by the timer mechanism part of the game.

RATING: 8
A classic game of chaos and destruction. In fact the more destruction the better...even when it is you. 

The game is split into 2 key phases...building your space trucky/ship and then seeing what events cross your path and seeing if it can stay in one piece.

The building is done in real time against all other players, so their is competition for ship parts and this lends the game its frantic/anxiety building nature. Every component has its place from lasers and shields to cargo bays and life support systems.

This game is really about the laughs that take place at people's misfortunes. Somewhere around the 10 game mark players gain a level of understanding when it comes to building a ship and that can make it hard for newbies to compete and the mishaps go down considerably due to good ship design.

This makes the 1st expansion a must if you want to go past the 20 play mark and beyond.

After my initial enthusiasm I was a bit disappointed and therefore lowered my rating to 7. This has in part to do with my inability to build a decent ship. I simply don't enjoy the building face, which is a very important, if not the most important part of the game. After the building of the ship the fun begins. Well, unless you totally forgot to add any turbo or other such details. :)

Chaotic with fun moments but a bit too complicated for what you get. Draw tiles, try to figure out what they do and where they fit in your space ship. If you fail to build the ship quickly, not only do you get to start last but you also get a weaker ship, making catch up difficult. My main issue is that once the ship is built, you have little control of what happens during the flight, making the second part feels like a long scoring session.

Players race to build a spaceship consisting of engines, batteries, crew members, shields and other components. The speed of the build phase is governed by a sand timer. Players then use the ships they have built to run through a gauntlet of random events. These events usually cause damage to your ships, sometimes in a hilarious manner. It's a fun, light game.

I loved most of it. I definitely loved the building part. The actual trucking part was where this game just fell apart for me. The first round was fun and exciting. The second round was OK, by the third round, the deck was large and it was just so boring watching my spaceship fall apart when there was nothing I could do about it.

It isn't that I didn't actually enjoy watching my spaceship blow up. I love destruction. It just seemed to take too long. I got bored during the trucking phase.

I love the idea of random chaos, in short bursts. As much as I really wanted to love all of this game, I just found myself wanting to play something else by the time the end rolled around.

Junkyard Wars, the game! Or at least, that's what it feels like. There are two parts to the game, one where you build your ship, and one where you fly it (and watch it fall apart). Can be frustrating to new players, but the humor inherent in the game often makes up for any hard feelings. Very fun with experienced players, and expansions provide additional rules to make the game more interesting and more replayable.

The game definitely favors more experienced players, but expansions provide handicaps to help balance player experience levels.

Ship building in real time is great fun as some people obsess over having the "prettiest ship" or "all the guns" (regardless of which way they face) or just finish as fast as possible.

Two house-rules suggested for introducing new players to the game: remove the construction timer for all phases (not just the first one), and if they have invalid tile placements in their ship when they're finished, have them remove tiles as damage until their ship is valid like usual, but then let them, if they want, forfeit their placement token (or not, whatever) to return to construction to fix the holes this leaves in their ship. Basically, let them make the ship they want and see how it goes.

Kind of disappointed by it. Too long and complicated for a game that falls in the "fun" category. The first part of building the ship is enjoyable although rather "solitaire on speed". The travel part is more bookkeeping than actual playing. Decisions are often quite obvious or random luck decides who gets hit hardest. In addition, the rulebook is horrible as a reference and trying to look something up can severely slow down the game.

As a final note: If you are considering purchasing Galaxy Trucker, the Anniversary Edition would be the version to get, but it doesn't change the fact that this is not much of a game.

Galaxy Trucker is a game where you are handed a ship that consists of empty blocks that you must fill in with chits that portray cargo areas, rockets, engines, living quarters, and other things.  After you and your friends build your ship you take it through space for a race.  While the race is going on things appear out of the deck such as meteors, space pirates, and many other events that will effect the outcome of the race and your ship as a whole.

I love this game and cannot wait to play it a few more times.  Last time I played my ship got demolished and I never had more fun!

RATING: 7
A game that is super fun the first time but loses a bit on subsequent plays -- it gets repetitive. The combination of phases, first a Mondo-like free-for-all shipbuilding phase followed by a series of events to test your newly built ship, is brilliant in concept and provides for a broad game-playing experience (2 games in one!)  
The delightful manual lays out a "test flight" scenario that's perfect for teaching -- highly recommend doing this before playing a real game with new players.
-----
Upping the rating a bit -- playing with 4 players and minimal explanation makes the game more enjoyable.

RATING: 9
There's actually a hell of a lot of strategy in Galaxy Trucker, buried under layers and layers of apparent chaos.  It's also a game of real skill -- play it enough times and you will need the Rough Road cards to balance out players.

The only times I've seen this game fail is with hardcore, perfect-info gamers.  They can go pound sand.  Galaxy Trucker is sheer, blissed-out, stupid fun.

2017 UPDATE: Yeah, just about perfect.

Just about the most fun one can have playing a board game. Hilarious when others' ships break in half and even funnier when yours does!

Velká zábava ve více lidech, ale hra je dobrá i ve dvou, což není úplně běžné a rozhodně si to zaslouží pozornost. Stavebnicový princip, který se v každé partii pravidelně opakuje je příjemným zpestřením, steně jako frenetické souboje o ty nejzajímavější komponenty.

With so many event cards, this turns into another 'hedge your bets' kind of game. I like the mechanism of building your ship, but with so many things to plan for, it's difficult to optimize. I'd like to play again, but probably won't be getting it myself.

RATING: 9
You first build a spaceship and then encounter some events and must try to a) keep ship in one piece b) collect goods & cash. The building part is done simultaneously in realtime fashion. Everyone takes pieces from the same pool but if you don't like the piece then others have chance to use it. You can reserve pieces but if you cannot later place them onto your ship then you're penalized. The little problem here is that some are fast and good at this and some slow and bad. That means that with some groups game isn't really fair. But if there is enough randomness and more importantly fun while playing that it hasn't mattered in my playing groups yet.

You can build spaceships in different fashions and depending on the events (and their order) the others are better than others. Because you're allowed to look through most events you can have idea of which way to build. Problem is that the time going through events is taken away from your building time. After few games it feels that cannons might be a bit too powerful overall, hard to say.

This is a very good and especially fun game to play. Sometimes you can get through events without a scratch (if you've build your ship well!) and the other times you have half of your ship left when the round is over. For some reason it seems that I'm usually in the latter group... but still enjoying the game a very much. A very fun game where space ship building skills are needed but there is so much luck involved too that you just might get lucky with not-so-elegant designs as well.

The game works great with 2-4 players but it's better with 3 or 4 players.

I do not like science fiction. This is a science fiction game. I do not like games dominated by luck. There is a lot luck in this one. Actually this game is filled with elements I do not like. Still I seem to enjoy this game every now and then. What intrigues me is the way all elements are put together. This is really an original game. It is also a light game you cannot take seriously. Each time I play everyone seems to have fun. What bothers me is that you keep doing the same thing again and again but every time you do it it takes a little longer. Blah! I do not want to play too often.

The strategy here is pretty simple.  Its a quick puzzle building game.  Loads of hilarity.

As quick as you can, find the ship parts you need and put them in the right place.  To have a better idea of what events are coming, you can take the time to review up to 75% of the upcoming events (the remaining 25% are random).  You want to be the first to finish your ship if at all possible. People who finish last are less likely to get the best rewards.

I own the iOS app and while its no substitute for the board game, its fun.

RATING: 8
This mixes a frantic and sometimes highly competitive stage of building your ship in a timed session with a racing stage where a deck of event cards determines how rich you and your crew will be after that stage. You then get to do it all over again!

The timed shipbuilding stage is a puzzle game where every player is going into the same pile of tokens at the same time trying to build a ship that has it all, but hopefully doesn't fall apart enroute. You need to make sure that all the connections line up or you will lose that piece before the race stage even begins. The order players finish their trucks determines which order they start the race in. To me, this is the funnest part of the game with the potential for some blocking elbows and cringing faces of dismay trying to find some piece that will get the ship to hold together. 

The second phase is where players race around a board based on event cards. The ships are in order and that order determines who gets to play an action on that card first such as grabbing goods from planets, charging the engines up, fighting off pirates, or dodging asteroids. At the end of this phase, whatever corporation runs the show pays you for the goods, gives you a reward based on what position you finished, and another reward for the best looking ship. 

I will say that the game is a blast with the typical learning time of around 20-45 minutes, though the instructions are wise enough to have a starter mission for first-timers. There is that element present in many Victory Point games at the end where one player wins 36 to 35 points and no one can quite figure out what the secret winning move was. It's almost as if you just need to be near the front of the pack and hope that lady luck shines on you. This isn't a detraction from the game per se and maybe it's even why we play games; you just won't walk away with a victory with the full knowledge that your superior self bested everyone based on expert tactics and strategy.

Une bonne découverte. Un jeu fun de programmation où on subit plutôt qu'autre chose et où il est quasiment impossible d'en sortir vivant.
Le thème est bien, les mécaniques de jeu aussi et on rigole bien en voyant les vaisseaux de chaque joueur se faire pulvériser.
C'est peut-être une fausse impression mais en y réfléchissant bien, on a un peu aussi la sensation de jouer chacun de son côté tant les interactions entre joueurs sont limités. Cependant cela n'enlève rien au charme du jeu.

The second phase may take too long. The joke of watching space ships fall apart has worn off. The flight phase is boring now, and it's evident that the lack of direct interaction creates the feelding off a multiplayer soliteire. Dropped by 1.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I realized recently that the expansion killed this game for me. It added way to many rules/mechanics with very little pay out. I actually enjoyed the base game and I am now looking for a copy (mostly because my son loves this game). I finally picked up another copy for my son and have enjoyed some plays of it. Still not a game I'm clamoring to play, but it is much better without the expansion we had (which was the second one).[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (7.5):[/COLOR]

[i]First couple of games were shaky, lots of rules to remember. I thought this was going to end up being a poor purchase decision, but even though my kids ships are getting trashed they still want to play. Also this has been the worst game, by far, to punch out all the cardboard chits. Even when using a razor blade I still had a few pieces tear.

I think this is a fun family game, my kids really enjoy playing. They love building things (hence our huge collection of legos) and this game offers them a chance to do that. My daughter Madeline (who just turned 8) can hold her own. Her ships are not always as well built, but she has won because she always builds ships with tons of storage. They both handle it well when parts of their ship are destroyed, we usually have a good laugh. I would recommend this as a good family game, especially if your kids love to build things.[/i]

By far one of the most unique games I have played in a while. I sold it to my wife by calling it space Carcasconne but that is not entirely accurate.

Wow! Totally impressed with this game! Build your ship...as best you can...as quick as you can...and with the most components that you will need for your space mission! That's it really...then you are sent into space...maybe your ship will hold together...maybe not! And for your hard work...you might earn just a few galactic cents...gotta love that bit! The base game is nice, but you will really need the big expansion to make the game really complete! I'm sorry to say...you will have to shell out some more cash for the expansion...but you will outgrow the base game far too quickly...you will need more challenges. This is where the expansion will come in handy! You see...every time you introduce new players, you will need the base game...but you the experienced player will need to have more challenges to even the playing field! That's why you will have to do it! No no...you must!

I find that most peoples complaints about this game is the timer and how it prevents you from building a really complete ship. I do believe that this game is meant to be a fun yet devastating romp in space, where you go in with a somewhat dilapidated ship and you see if you can earn a few galactic cents from the journey through the complete luck of the draw of cards. If you know going in that you probably won't survive the trip, I think it helps ease the tension of trying to build a perfect ship for winning.

This needs some sort of house-rule for less-than-four player games. In those, there are just too many tiles to choose from, and too much time. E.g. randomly draw out 15 tiles for each player under 4, or something. Smaller supply ought to make things more interesting.

Currently at the very top of my list of "games my wife asks to play." So much fun. This was my second-ever realtime game (first being Space Hulk), and it immediately sent me into a lovefest for all things Vlaada. 

Really smart design, the puzzle-building is rewarding, and the theme is light enough that it's not so awful to watch your ship get torn apart during the actual mission. And this will happen! If you're not on board with having your ship destroyed *for fun*, you won't enjoy this game. 

Honestly I think the game only becomes really enjoyable after you've dialed in your ship-building skills. Then at least you're not feeling so invested when the asteroids and space pirates come along and blow you away.

"WAY too long for what it is (both of my plays have run 90-120 minutes). Silly ship assembly followed by drawn-out random sillyness. I would rather play a 'real' game (or 2 or 4) in the same amount of time."

What I liked:
- Goofy fun
- Creative and unusual design

What I didn't like:
- High randomness
- Too many small rules
- Tile design could have been much clearer
- Runs way too long (90-120 minutes) for such a random game

It's all in good fun, but I see it as more of a time-passer than a strategic game. As a 30-minute game, I would probably enjoy it. But at 90-120, it just feels like a huge waste of time, during which we could have played a "real" game. 

Initial rating of 5 lowered to 4 after my second play. 

There are a lot of little rules (this only activates if it is next to that, but these can be anywhere; this turbo destroys its thing but that doesn't), which for me pushes the weight well above the 2.3 BGG rating. I would say more like 2.6.

I must get better explaining it to new players. Even without the expansions it's a bit tricky for newbies!

I really love the fast pace and zero downtime of the first round and then the peaceful intermission that second round is. And then fast again! 

Absolutely brilliant design! Chvatil never stops impressing me.

New purchase. Components look fabulous however the tiles on punching them out got a little messed up. A black sharpie came to the rescue so its a minor complaint. Worried about replay value though but that just means I'll get the Big Expansion later. Too bad it costs as much or more than another game.....

New -  The game is fun and my friends love it however even after a few plays I'm starting to feel like the game is losing its edge. This game seems like it might need the expansion to have me pull it out without being asked first.

Building your ship is a speed game, then you have to transport your goods in a race to be the best. The game also gets tougher as you need a bigger ship in subsequent rounds. Very original, worth a try by anyone.

Unlike some people, I like the danger and uncertainty of the second phase of the game.  Will your ship be destroyed?  Will you lose all your engines and be lost in space?  Or will you emerge without a scratch and cash in all those valuable cargo blocks?

RATING: 8
This game is really enjoyable but incredibly chaotic. With the game being broken into two rounds you have one where you race to construct your ship and then another where you take your ship into the dangerous final frontier.

The biggest problem with this is the lack of a reference sheet, which means that every piece needs to be explained which makes this a long game to teach.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is just silly fun. I love how it requires you to quickly build your spaceship and then watch it just get pummeled left and right. The game does "play you" a bit, but I think it's just a blast to furiously make your spaceship within time, and then get furious watching your haphazard creation fall to pieces.

Un gioco fresco, leggero, originale (caratteristica primaria delle creazioni di Vlaada Chvatil) e molto sottovalutato: per me è il gioco del 2007. Si ride con gli altri e degli altri, mentre gli altri ridono di te. Le regole sono facilissime da spiegare a quelli che non giocano mai ai giochi da tavolo. La prima volta che ho letto le divertentissime istruzioni (scritte come la Guida Galattica di Douglas Adams) ero perplesso dalla costruzione della nave: azione contemporanea, asimmetrica, caotica, governata dal culo e con poco tempo a disposizione. Poi l'ho provata e mi sono ricreduto: è il modo più divertente di giocare, con l'ambientazione che giustifica questo tipo di svolgimento (i disgraziati frugano tutti insieme in un magazzino, alla disperata ricerca di pezzi da attaccare al carrozzone che li porterà a destinazione). La seconda parte è ben pensata (e il fatto che si compiano tre viaggi alza il morale agli ultimi, che possono rifarsi), con gli eventi che coinvolgono tutti (e quelli del terzo viaggio sono davvero pesanti da risolvere). Mi è piaciuto il sistema che gestisce l'ordine di arrivo, e la qualità degli eventi casuali. Anche il viaggio è governato dal culo, ma puoi limitarlo sbirciando il 75% degli eventi durante la costruzione della nave (e realizzare qualcosa di adatto alle situazioni che ti si pareranno davanti). Inoltre, una nave ben costruita evita una buona parte dei guai che possono capitarti durante il viaggio. Un difetto? L'esperienza fa fare astronavi migliori, e in una partita tra giocatori con esperienza variabile, difficilmente la lotta sarà all'ultimo credito. Un altro difetto? Dopo un po', c'è il rischio che tutti conoscano tutte le carte evento a memoria (ma per questo, c'è l'espansione).

Build your ship out of junk and race through the galaxy!!! Fun game, with nicely designed pieces. There is a certain guilty satisfaction in watching your opponents ship fall apart because of a loose connection or a badly-placed meteor :)
Only real drawback is that experienced players have a massive advantage over new players - the race to build your ship is a lot easier when you know what to look for! This can be ameliorated by introducing a handicap - unfortunately, I don't know if the rules suggest a good way of doing this, as my version is in German!

Galaxy Trucker is a very bizarre game for me. The first few games I absolutely loved it. My ship was being torn to pieces, we were all groaning the entire time and it just felt like an uphill battle. A few games later and the base game became very boring. It's WAY too easy to do well once you have ~6 plays under your belt. We were often left with little to no damage to our ship and it became who could build a better ship overall in a shorter amount of time. Blech.

I will say though, adding in the first expansion really brings this game back to it's roots for me. I feel like it's essential to make the game interesting again.

Includes the Even Steven cards.

Great game! It looks good, and plays well. This sure looks like a game where experience pays off, but I wouldn't mind playing it again and again. 

Galaxy Trucker was based on a mechanism in Factory Fun, an even better game. My gaming partners seemed to like it better than Factory Fun. I don't agree with them; because of the careful placement of machines in FF, I'm much more proud of the constructions in that game than of the ships in GT, and that counts against the latter.

A fun game and a breath of fresh air after so many sleep-inducing euros. Watching my ship blow apart is more fun than it sounds.

EDIT: Without the expansions it's a lot less chaotic than I would have liked. Some people I know have nearly perfect ship designs for each round that are close to invicible. Needs expansions to keep the explosions flying.

8/11/09 Lowered from 8 to 7.5, doesn't offer the competitive challenge of many other games, so it often gets passed over.  Personally I would like to play more.

12/29/09 Back to an 8.  I finally got my wife to learn this game, and she's requested we play it the last three nights.  I'm reading "The Big Sky" and the last chapter started with a line that made me think of G.T.: "If trouble's certain, try and enjoy it."  That what makes Galaxy Trucker so fun, you know you're gonna be smacked around, you're just there to enjoy the ride.

Very original game: players have to simultaneously grab tiles from a common pile and use them to build a ship. Then they must take it on a journey full of dangers. A good ship will be prepared to deal with all the threats and get away without a scratch in the paint. A bad ship will be literally teared apart. 

When I first heard about Galaxy Trucker I was put off by the simultaneous/timed aspect of the gameplay. However after playing it I was conquered! The game is just so much fun! The building phase is tense and engaging while the travel phase is fun and chaotic. 

Experience is really important and even though there's a fair amount of randomness present the better players will win easily against newbies.

I had some concerns about replayability but I'm almost at 10 plays without any signs of getting tired. I have the expansion but I still haven't opened it yet.

There are so many different spaceship parts that it's very interesting trying to fit all necessary pieces to the ship. Sometimes you won't even get the pieces you need while others just pick them faster than you (they are picked simultaneously).

One word game review :- FUN!
This is a funny game, you get LOADS of bits in the box, satisfyingly heavy and all the components are top notch and look great when laid out for a game. Build your spaceship as best you can and then watch it all get blown away. If you're lucky you've built a stable and sturdy machine and you'll land at your destination brimming with goods, on the other hand you end up drifting in space with no toilet roll.....

The game manual is the best I've ever read, well written, very amusing (think Hitch Hikers guide to the Galaxy) and seems to cover all you need to know to get up and running quickly.

Highly recommended.

I like everything about the game. The theme is great. The tension of building your ship one piece at a time is exciting. Surviving the obstacles is hilarious and fun. But the abundance of rules seems to undercut the funny, casual feeling of the game. If I could get this same package of mechanisms from a shorter and simpler game it would be an all time great. Since I often play with new players or casual players, though, having to muddle through the rules each time takes away from the enjoyment.

A timed race in which players construct ships followed by a largely "luck of the draw" where their ships are attacked and slowly are filled with valuable cargo and destroyed.

I guess it's supposed to be fun to see if your ship holds together longer than the competitor's ship, but it feels like 3 minutes of fun followed by half an hour of largely programmed moves playing out as you watch and cheer for your ship to survive. Basically it feels a bit like a roll-and-move.

Very much an "experience" game. You can play it to win, but because the randomness can really hose you, really you play for the game experience.

The game play here is definitely different than in other games. It's certainly not a game to be taken too seriously as players have a speed element during ship construction, so you can't think about things and try to build the best suit. You just get what you can with the time you have... then player field them on the race track. It's quite a random game (in terms of its design and in terms of how it plays)

Pricey for what it is: build a spaceship with parts you don't really want with a random end result and try to survive random events that occur to you. Low strategy, low decision making, high luck. Sure it's funny to see ships implode at first, then it just gets lame and games end with super low scoring because everyone tends to die or just give up and rake in half points. I could not even convince my gaming group to play more than once. Prefered the Ipad app, much quicker.

The randomness should be offputting to me and to others but the pure chaos offsets it somehow. The frantic building of ships is a board gamers adrenaline rush--which comes to a crash as your hand-crafted ship disintegrates around itself during play. Also allows for some amount of decision making (stopping for objectives) but not too much to take away from the pure chaos of the game.

To start, Galaxy Trucker is my kind of game.  It's got the right mixture of planning, chance, interaction, 'bit love', excitement, and just plain fun and the only complaint is that the game doesn't sit 6.. (but it could with an expansion ... nudge, nudge, wink, wink)

The skinny on the rules: Galaxy Trucker is played in three rounds, each round consisting of a 'ship building' phase, followed by a 'ship flying' phase.

In the ship building phase, players compete to build ships on player board with carcassonne-like squares following some basic assembly rules.  Players will want to ensure that their ship has adequate guns, adequate thusters, adequate shields, adequate storage (for stable and unstable goods), adequate shelter for both human and alien crew, and finally batteries to run the whole thing.  Of course, there's typically only enough space to safely address a few of these needs.

In the second half, players take their newly built ships and contend with increasingly difficult and increasingly longer missions to earn money.  How do you earn money?  Mostly by landing on planets and getting goods, then selling them at the end of the run.  Alternatively, you can get money by killing pirates or slavers, or by sacrificing crew on an abandoned space ship.

In short: Again, I think this is a fantastic game.  There are many many components and CGE uses the four basic game foodgroups to make their pieces: plastic, wood, glass and cardboard.  I don't think I could ever turn down a game of Galaxy Trucker (fondly called 'Space Truckin' around here).

It will be interesting to see the Rio Grande reprint.  I'd be surprised if the reprint has the same kind of components.. but I also think that this game is in good hands with Rio Grande.  It's the kind of game that could benefit from several expansions, and I'll bet that Rio Grande is more than happy to make it happen if the game continues to be successful.

Well, there might not be much in the way of strategy here, but the fact is that this game is pure FUN. There are many laughs mingled in with the tension...not an easy balance...and I love it that way.

Basically 2 games are present here, but they interlock so beautifully. After setup comes the "Contruct Your Vehicle Puzzle". Put together the tiles of your ship, preferably before your opponents, gathering as much power, speed, and storage as possible, in as tightly and safely constructed a manner as you can, while the sands of time run out on you. A quick check to see if your ship is space-worthy...and if not you will pay some penalties...and you move into the second part of the game, the "Journey Across the Galaxy with Your Ship Made From Sewer Pieces". This consists of piloting your ship across the galaxy, trying your best to avoid Meteroic Showers, Pirates, Slavers, and Epidemics, while also picking up as much cargo as you can, all while trying to keep your ship as intact as possible. Events described above are enacted by card draws and it can truly get to a point where each draw becomes tension filled as your ship flies apart event by event. 

My rating represents, first and foremost, the "Fun Factor", but also the fun graphic design, the lovely bits (Especially love the Tic Tac batteries), the nicely meshed mechanics that drive the game forward, AND the very funny rule book. 

This game is not for everyone, clearly, as others have written, but it is definitely for me. Great stuff.

This is a frenetic, fast-paced game with a trading pit atmosphere when you're building your ships. This can be a lot of fun with the right crowd, and the rules are structured very well to allow the amount of time your group would like to take. Watching your ship get assailed by the adventure cards during your trucking experience is a lot of fun, even when you're getting the short end of the stick.

One caveat is that this game needs equally experienced folks. Otherwise you should use the team play option to make the game more balanced.

A game of 2 halves, and both of them play brilliantly.

The frantic ship building is just challenging enough to stay interesting without becoming over-taxing, and there always seems to be someting you know you could do better next time.

Then, the journey itself follows, which is sometimes hilarious, always gripping, as you will your ship to survive to the end! There are also a few (important) decisions to be made here, such as whether to dispatch crew for points/credits, or jostling for position on the track, etc. So it doesn't actually just feel like you're along for the ride.

The game as a whole runs about the right length for what it is, but the (excellent) rules even give some ideas for how to adapt the game for shorter/longer timescales, for partnership play, etc.

The components are great, and the box is (for once!) actually the right size for the contents.

The only slight drawback of the game is that there are quite a lot of concepts to explain to new players. But, again, the rulebook ingeniously contains a section which guides you through an introductory game with trimmed-down rules - however there is still a lot to take in for a novice gamer.

Frantic and fun. I give everyone a die for asteroids and I play the cards really fast. Everyone is here for the shipbuilding the rest it just scoring really.

RATING: 4
Although I haven't played Factory Fun, I guess I would be right in saying this game is what happens when FF meets Starship Catan. I like puzzle aspect and the tense race to perfect a ship in the first phase of a round. But I really, really do not like the second phase where you fly your ship through a card scripted adventure (as in Starship Catan). This part of the game is fiddly, dull but most of all can be really destructive, which is where most of the "fun" lies. It is like an '80s design and made me feel as if I was building a sand castle before the tide comes in , only to get someone to walk through it. Now I'm not against Schadenfreude (I even laugh hysterically when I think of my mate being sick on a fishing trip) but I think I dislike it in Galaxy Trucker because I exercise my mind and effort in construction, only to have my creation crushed. 

Update: I needed to play a second game as first play with 3 seemed flat as there was no real competition for ship building as it was fairly easy to have no exposed connectors. So the next game with 4 saw alot of damage and some fun with thte ships breaking apart bigtime. I also concerned that an experienced leader can get too much of an advantage.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Reminds me of Factory Fun a little bit. The grabbing of tiles, the timer, and the dice rolling make the game less appealing for me. The required visual quickness in the game favors players with that natural and innate ability, as is the case in the game of "Set".  But I think repeated plays drastically improves the speed of tile assessment and better and more efficient tile placements. Review is after only one play.

RATING: 9.89
This is what happens when you merge a light-strategy game with party games, and the result is beautiful. You want the most points, and you want the best built ship possible to go racing round the galaxy, but take too long in building your ship and you risk it being left behind in the dust as your opponents take the parts you need and leave you with a withered skeletal construction. Be too hasty in your ships construction and you risk it falling apart on launch. Either way it's always tremendous fun trying to cobble your ship together and connect up all the parts of the ship before time runs out.

RATING: 9
Though some people eschew this after one game, I cannot see why anyone wouldn't like it.  Building is fun and frantic, and the expansion adds quite a bit of new and worthwhile material that can enable scaling up of difficulty.  I do not like the addition of a 5th player since it requires you to re-interpret cards from the original set.

This is just one of those games that completely missed the mark for me, and didn't live up to my high hopes.  The actual ship building time is kinda fun, but the journey phase just seems to drag on forever and suck all the fun out of the game for me.  It's fiddlyness and complexity just don't jive with the ligh hearted theme of the game and make it an odd match.  It also make it a pain to teach.  I really did want to embrace this one, but each time I played it I disliked it a little more.

Amusing beer & pretzels game. The real time rush to build a ship has some appeal but I can seeing that diminishing as you get used to the variety of tiles.

I think I need to find some more aggressive board gamers... What is supposed to be a mad scramble at the beginning for all the best space ship pieces always ends up with me elbowing everyone else out of the way to a chorus of "calm down, dear" from the meeker players!

The building spaceships element of the game is incredibly fun and completely different. I've only given it an 8/10 overall due to the weaker second stage (actually flying the bugger!) As long as you embrace the mayhem, you'll have a great time. Just don't sulk too much when your beloved ship gets hammered to shreds by meteoric swarms (*cough* DAD! *cough*)

Galaxy Trucker is amusing to play, puzzle with random results.

The first phase you are assembling your ship contraptions as you try to match up tiles to build out from a central core with things like engines, guns and completed sides to the outside While you have crew cabins, energy pods, cargo holds somewhere in the ship. 
The use of a timer to control this aspect of the game makes for the needed urgency to complete the build phase.

The second phase is when you face the random dangers of the galaxy with things like planets to get goods, abandoned ships to take for money or get goods, pirates, slavers (which seem to be too strong), war zones to get through and of course the ever present meteors. 
The cards have the direction from where the meteor or hit will come. The ships are built on grids which use dice to determine the location of the hit. Your decisions if any is to determine when to power you engines, guns and shields and if you want to take advantage of opportunities on the way at the cost of time.
The first goal of this "race" is to survive, with the added benefits to be the leader and picking up trade goods along the way. Being in the lead is a mixed blessing yes you get first crack and the good stuff, but you also get first crack at the bad stuff as well.
This part of the game pretty much plays itself, the amusement comes from watching your creation fall apart from the damage. This is game where you have to enjoy watching what happens to you and the other players - it is best played with a sociable group.

Nothing's more fun than creating a pristine ship with no exposed connectors only to have it blown to pieces by pirates!  This game is a great time, especially in a non-competitive crowd that's looking more for a good time rather than winner take all.

player interaction is great. Not a very hard game to play. Only real disadvantage is that playing with beginners there is a big gap between your pace in building and theirs. Off coarse it's covered in the rules but the switching board doesn't really work. We use to team up and build two ships with one team, everybody flying apart but with communication possible. This makes it fun because it gets more tactical and takes down a little luck.

This is the real deal. There's nothing else quite like it in board games or video games (though I hear that Faster than Light comes close in the video game department). It is frustrating in that one small building error or one unanticipated event can totally wreck you, but if you accept that possibility then you are in for one wild and awesome ride. My videogamer friends were raving about this one after I showed it to them and talking about making it their first board game purchase. I haven't tested it on nongamers yet, but I fear it might be too intense for them. Gamers who can tolerate chaos and calamity will love it, hands down.

EDIT: I tested it on nongamers, and it was too intense for them. I still highly recommend this for gamers who have any sort of kooky side.

A great game.  The more damage and destruction you take the more fun it is.  I like to modify the rules and double or even triple the amount of events during a round.  When everyone comes drifting a derelict ship with no crew into dock at the end of the round it's always a good time.

Zany fun. Real time building of the spaceship is a kind of crazy experience as you madly rush for ship parts that not only fit but are the right types of things that you want on board, all while trying to beat other players who are doing the same. Then you fly these shoddily built things through a series of missions, often to hilarious results with components falling off or getting blasted into oblivion. There is some strategy and plenty of tactics that mean good play is rewarded, but there are also plenty of random elements. If you're looking for a game with some meaningful decisions and a host of zany side effects, this could be great. If you're looking for something very deterministic, stay far away. 

I am not always in the right mood to want to ply this, but when I am this is a great time.

Ship building was exactly what I hoped it would be. Scoring was a bit unintuitive (why do we keep going backwards?) but after a couple plays I had a much better sense of what to expect. Now I know what firepower/crew I'll need to have the best odds of surviving an adventure. Bigger ships are actually easier to build as you can fit more necessities onboard. There was a bit of a learning curve, so I had a LOT more fun with my fourth ship than my first. Definitely a game that rewards multiple plays. Into my Top Ten.

(Original comment):

After one test play, all I want to do is play it again. I lost, but I just laughed as my ship fell apart (and also won "prettiest ship" as losing pieces meant I had fewer open connectors). Looking forward to more missions and more spectacular failures.

The yin/yang of this game is I guess technically in balance, but maybe this is how I learned I simply don't like yang. The first half of this game is fun, frantic, and active. You build your ship and it's fast and wonderful and everyone has a great time. And then the second half is helpless and passive, and I didn't enjoy it nearly as much. I found little to enjoy about sitting there and making very few meaningful decisions. And I get why the passivity exists, thematically, but that doesn't make it fun. Yeah, watching your ship get destroyed technically captures the helpless feeling, but so what? I'd rather do something than nothing. 

I'll probably play it again in a few years. I'd totally own this if the second half of the game were even remotely enjoyable. But it was a lot of rules and fiddle for what was essentially a passive experience. No es bueno. Maybe playing it once instead of three times would be OK? It's not like anyone cares who won anyway.

Fun game for wild starship building. Most people enjoy this one, although gets a bit boring after enough plays, as building the ship becomes quite easy and missions get a bit repetitive.

A rather clever game design and deceiptively simple because all you have to do in this game is create a spaceship out of tiles, more or less, a puzzle game, nothing more. But it is still fun, because the idea of competing against the other players who are also trying to create the perfect spaceship is great. I do not second the opinion that the exploration phase is no fun, I think it is  but I can see how some might find it too random and non-decision based. A good game.

There is some fun in composing your space ship as you grab the pieces. But then there is this terrible long examination how much your ship is worth. And why is this game thematic?

RATING: 5
I'll rate this a 5 after one play.

I'm told that the first time is the worst time with this game, but my problem was that the game didn't seem random enough.

I'll give Galaxy Trucker kudos for being the most unique game I've played since X-Bugs.

Experienced players seem to build most excellent ships.  Widescale destruction is for the newb.  I was expecting the threats to be bigger and more devestating.

There's acutally quite a bit to think about while turning over cards.  Is it more important to spend time to grab something now or wait until later?  But this seemed more in the realms of the person who was first.  The person in last place sits around waiting for the people in first place to decide what they want to do.

I was expecting more "whiz-bang" out of the game with stuff blowing up all around.  Instead it seemed rather procedural with too few things blowing up.

I would like to try it some more.

Tile placement with a twist.  Very fun, but it seems you either love it or hate it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
UPDATE: Lowered rating from 7 to 5.

It appears that there's only one ideal way to build your ship that would be able to withstand almost all event cards: Either tiles have a specific place where they should be placed (i.e. lasers always at the front, engines always at the back), or they could be placed anywhere (the rest of the tiles). There really aren't any tough decisions along the lines of putting a specific tile here would give me one advantage, while putting a tile in another place would give me another.

Because of this, there really is only one "solution" to the puzzle at hand, and once you've figured this out (which is easier than it appears despite the large amount of rules for this really light game), then the game becomes a race to see who could find the more important, rare tiles first, and the first to spot how tiles should fit together.

What somewhat mitigates this are huge bonus cards and very nasty events that reward a surplus of one tile over another. But I don't think it doesn't adequately increase the difficulty of the puzzle part of the game for experienced players -- they simply take advantage of the rule of peeking through the event deck and build their ships accordingly.

One other unfortunately flaw is that this game severely punishes beginners (meaning those who have built really bad ships) quite badly. Since this is one of those games that greatly rewards experience, this might give newbies a bad first impression.



===================

Tentative 7.

Cons:
* For a game this light, it has way, way too many components.
* Rules are very, very fiddly.

The base game is a bit too easy for my (and some other players') taste, although if your players haven't spent much time doing spatial puzzles they might have a different experience.

Still, a remarkable design that consistently leads to funny moments.

RATING: 9
Silly game where you build a spaceship from tiles and then sail it through various hazards. Speed is essential, as all players are building their ships at the same time from the same tiles. The fun is then watching peoples ships disintegrate once the hazards come into view.

The upside:
- Building a space-ship
- The tension that amounts when you see the time getting away and your ship is far from being fully prepared for the dangers of deep space.

Epicooo! Questo spettacolare gioco spaziale, simpatico e "caciarone", che mi ha fatto scoprire l'autore Ceco: Vlaada Chvàtil e quel geniaccio inesauribile che è, in grado di passare da un genere ad un altro portando sempre innovazione. Infatti dopo anni di giochi che mi sembravano uguali o troppo simili fra loro, finalmente compare qualcosa di diverso e soprattutto divertente, con una componentistica dei materiali (le piccole batterie in vetro a forma di Tic-Tac, sono graziosissime) ed una grafica (incluso il manuale delle regole in stile simpatico e spassoso), che non hanno nulla da invidiare a titoli più blasonati. Sostanzialmente ci sono due fasi di gioco: la prima, in cui ognuno crea la propria astronave assemblando pezzi in lotta contro il tempo, rappresenta infatti un'esperienza impagabile: un'emozione infantile, primordiale, prepotente, vivida, entusiasmante, tirando fuori l'ingegnere meccanico che è in ognuno di noi. Si ride, si grida, si spulcia, si solleva, si scarta, si rubano pezzi da sotto le mani dell'avversario; mentre la seconda, quella del viaggio di esplorazione, in cui ognuno sognerebbe di mettere finalmente alla prova la qualità e la tenuta della propria meravigliosa astronave, assemblata arraffando pezzo dopo pezzo, si traduce in nient'altro che sciagure, dove è un piacere veder volare nello spazio pezzi di navi (altrui!) distrutti e/o sconnessi da meteoriti vaganti e "laserate" di pirati, per farsi delle "grasse" risate! Fino a quando qualche astronave si divide in due pezzi e si cerca di tentare di rientrare alla base con il carico e quel che rimane dello scafo e... allora via a "spanciarsi" dal ridere. Uno dei pochi giochi in cui ci si diverte quando si perde! Il gioco dovrebbe piacere senz'altro a quasi ogni tipologia di persona, peccato che è limitato ad appena quattro giocatori, quando avrebbe potuto senza troppi problemi venire esteso ad almeno cinque.

Even though this type of puzzle style game wouldn't attract my attention, the game design is so original it deserves several plays at least. You just want to play it again because you know you can build a better ship! I'm totally crap at it and it felt like it went too long - it is also almost too chaotic - but I really admire the design.

RATING: 7.5
Certainly fun, the ship building is groovy and I like it that it's not strictly time based (One player has to make a conscious decision when the last timer is actually flicked on) so building the ship is actually a bit less chaotic than you might expect.

Of course it's random, but in a good and silly way. It plays pretty fast, is a bit off-beat in comparison to other games I play, which is definitely a positive thing in this case.

Awesome components, Awesome amounts of fun.  The fun far outweighs arguments that it lacks in strategy.  There is plenty of strategy to how you build your ship and how and when you stop for different encounters during the flight.  In fact, it wouldn't make sense to not have things happen somewhat random to someone pioneering a space voyage in a hunk of junk.  Why would a person that built a ship out of garbage have perfect information?   Great game!!!

Galaxy Trucker is like Sci-Fi Carcassonne on meth.  This is not an insult.  Build a ship--fast.  Take it through an obstacle course designed by Satan of the Stars.  Do it over again only the next time, you have to build it bigger and better.

This game rewards people who can laugh at themselves and who don't mind it their whole ship falls apart.  The main problem with this game is that if one or more people build far inferior ships, they can end up sitting around doing nothing while the people with well built ships (i.e. players with experience) play the game.  It's no fun to wait in space dock while everyone else galavants among the stars.  Even so, Galaxy Trucker is awesome; it's sugar coated bliss on a stick.

***Update***

Now that I own Galaxy Trucker, I am convinced of its greatness.  I still really enjoy the frantic shipbuilding aspect, but I've now got a greater appreciation for the flight phase.  There ARE decisions to make in the flight phase.  What kind of cargo do you pick up? Do you leave some of your guys on abandoned ships? do you power all of your engines or cannons?  These are no obvious types of decisions that make the game quite exciting!  The ship building phase is still awesome though.  I love the feeling I get when I've finished my ship and I examine it and realize that I could have built it so much better and smarter.  It's an excited disappointed feeling that makes me smile when I think about it.

***Update***

I've lowered the rating again because Galaxy Trucker is really difficult to teach.  The real-time nature of it (the part that's fun) makes it frustrating to try to bring new people into.

***Update***

My impression of Galaxy Trucker is sliding lately.  I really loved it at first; it was an instant nine.  But the more I play it, the more it starts to feel the same.  Plus I tend to get really sore hunching over the table sorting through pieces, and I invariably get a headache when I play.  While that's not the game's fault, it's started to lessen my desire to play it.  It feels a bit repetitive and while I enjoy the silly fun, it's less cool than I initially thought.  It's gone from being in my top ten to being number 25 on my list, and I'd be willing to guess that it will completely fall out of my top thirty.

Fun, frantic, chaotic.  Just what you'd expect from a game that blends elements of Factory Fun (construction) and Starship Catan (event exploration).  An enjoyable experience, but I'm just not sure there's enough substance or long term replayability.  It's mostly a game where you build something crazy that barely matters, let it go through a random set of obstacles, and hope there's something left when the dust settles.  Aside from the frantic building, there's really not a lot of active playing.

Every kid loves to build something only to feel the rush of smashing it apart.  You wouldn't think it possible to get that same excitement from shattering a frantically compiled spaceship from flat cardboard tiles, but Galaxy Trucker pulls it off.

I'm really enjoying Vlaada Chvatil's games.  He seems to embrace manufactured chaos, and I seem to enjoy it, so it's a good match ;)  I tend to find that the building aspect of this game is the really fun part, and mostly focus on building the most perfect ship I can, the rest of the game is fun, but kind of tacked on to give purpose to the building part.  This isn't a complaint though, mostly just an observation.  I've been seriously tempted to buy a second copy of the game just to get the extra tiles, since I enjoy having a lot of options available, but I haven't done that yet.  I've played this with more cutthroat players who really push the timer and it's still a lot of fun, but not quite as enjoyeable for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Like most Vlaada games, Galaxy Trucker is fantastic. The rulebook is well organized and entertaining. Perhaps the biggest surprise for me was that the game itself isn't actually very complicated and is fast to teach to new gamers. It also plays in a short amount of time.

Perhaps my only complaint is that real-time is a huge part of Galaxy Trucker's charm and it takes a couple games for new players to be less intimidated by it. Experienced players will definitely make less mistakes due to rushing.

Overall: Galaxy Trucker is awesome. Vlaada really is a genius in the way he creates such challenging, sometimes punishing games that I don't mind losing at. Can't help but smile when your ship blows up.

RATING: 7.75
While I find this game a fun play, it doesn't hit the table that much anymore.  The group I play with dislikes the way the ship building phase is designed.  I think the biggest issue is that its very difficult to play with someone of a different skill level (or someone who isn't good at putting a ship together quickly).  Someone who is good at that sort of thing (or more experienced with the pieces) will come out with the best ship and start first.  This leads to frustration from other players as it tends to punish the players who are less familiar with the games pieces (or more prone to analysis) and turn them off to the game.

Very fun game that is literally split into two "games". The first being a frantic "race to the finish" as you compete against each player building your ship in real time. The second is not time based, but each player will have their ship facing challenges based on cards. I think the time length for this game is perfect (about 1 hour), it just ended at the right time. If you like this you may want to look into expansions, however they may over complicate the game for newer or inexperienced players.

Very fun real-time game. During ship building there may be not to much (conscious) decisions apart from sparing some seconds to look at the upcoming events. In the end the game is very luck dependent (which tiles you draw and which events occur). Hence it should also be seen as an experience game, in which you also have some fun in seeing you ship getting destoyed.

I desperately want to like this game more.  I love building, I love the theme, I even love the rulebook.  But I can't shake the feeling that every time it comes to the actual race/card play, the game just bogs down into "Part of your ship is blown up...You lose crew...You pick up the best cargo available..."  There aren't really any choices and it can get boring.  Which is really a shame because the ship-building is a blast!

Updated 2016-09-18: My 7 year-old son loves this game.  We don't time our building, but everything is played normally.  Plus it doesn't take too long and we can always just do a single race at a time.

You can slap this down on the table with newbies, explain the rules in less than ten minutes, and be having a screaming good time in 15.

And it doesn't matter if you win or lose, it's still fun.  Great big hunks of your spaceship are blasted away, and you're laughing about it!  So you can play in a crowd of disparate skill levels and everyone's having a good time.

Just finishing with a positive score is challenge enough for a newbie.

This is so fun.  I suppose that you could get all strategic and learn to build the perfect ship, but I personally think that there's nothing more therapeutic than having your ship break in two.  And the nicest rule book I've seen- the 'training' game is a perfect way to introduce the mechanics without wasting any time before starting.

For fun, we tried taking all the time we wanted to build our ships.  A run of bad luck broke them both in half, then we lost our last few crewmwen a few parsecs later.  Love this game!!

So utterly different from everything else Vlaada has done - and indeed from more or less every other boardgame out there - but this still manages to be great fun, even for someone such as me who generally hates real-time games. It's great scrabbling desparately through the pool to try to find more guns/engines/cabins, or the one type of connector that you need - and then see your totally inadequate ship get blown to smithereens in the subsequent phase of play. Definitely a unique game - and not one I'd want to play to death, but still enormous fun.

+ Not strategic but the whole point of this game isn't to be mentally taxing so this is not a con in my mind

- Rulebook could be written in a somewhat more logical order, if you get rules wrong for the first few playthroughs, it is understandable

This game is more fun with more people. I love the theme.

A great time. Not strategic enough to become an obsession.

Update: This rating is only for the game as a 4 player team game with the variant where teammates switch when the sand timer is flipped.

Not as good as a two player game or without this variant.

rarely has hype harmed this hobby so badly as in the case of Galaxy Trucker, a game that fans describe as accessible to non-gamers and gamers alike. Neither a party game, nor a dexterity game, it sits awkwardly somewhere in its own space and I suspect only children (of all ages) making 'boom' noises while crashing their plastic plane on the kitchen table will be able to appreciate the originality on display (the game's only redeeming quality).

This game is a blast, so to speak. Build a ship as fast as you can that has everthing you need to survive a perilous space voyage with enough goods remaining to realize a profit. Some fresh ideas from my limited experience. A very enjoyable game with my kids (10yo). Great production, clever rules. What's not to like? (Ok, your carefully contructed ship may get blown into bitesize morsels by a stray meteor, but that's half the fun.)

Easy to learn and fun to play (whether you win or lose).
It's nice to build your ship (in real time), and then see it get destroyed (real fast)
Winning the game requires certain amount of luck, and game has more of a adventure feel then race (which is good IMO)

Really my SOs game, a birthday gift courtesy of me. She absolutely loves it. I enjoy it a lot though the actual flying through space isn't really all that exciting after the adrenaline fused mad scramble to build the ships.

Fun little euro with a great theme and idea. Build up your ship only to watch it get ruined by the universe. Again, one of those games that I always think of getting out but never actually do. I'm honestly not sure why I'm so lukewarm about this one.

RATING: 5
Pick up tiles, build a ship - would rather play Factory Fun.  Flip a series of cards for a random encounters - would rather play Diamant.  But combine those two, and the result is greater than the individual parts.  GAnd in this game, that combination just hits the right spot for me.  Not too serious, not too light - a fun game for 4 players.  There is a skill to building a ship to survive the journey - especially when one takes the time to peek at the upcoming adventure cards to be better prepared.  There is also some thought to be had in the adventure phase - do you want to race to the lead and face the risks first?  Or hang back and hope others will shield you.  And it is great fun to watch bits of your ship fall off from the various events.  Don't get too analytical with this one, just enjoy the ride.

Got to learn this from the publisher at Pionek in Gliwice 2007-12-09.  Real-time turning over tiles and choosing whether to add them to your spaceship grid reminded me a bit of Factory Fun, and sure enough FF was apparently an inspiration for this, which removes the occasional too-long pondering and is much faster moving.  Build your ship with various gadgets hooked together, then everyone flies them on a trade run, suffering various random events.  Despite the wide variety of random events, there is clearly skill in the ship design to attempt to handle the various stuff that can happen during the flight.  It was fun and interesting and had some clever ideas; I would need to play more to be more sure of my rating.

I feel like I should like this game more than I do.  I enjoy the ship-building part but, despite all of us being new to the game at the same time, there was a definite discrepancy in skill level - and it's no fun playing with people who are frustrated that you can build faster than them.

The actual flight was kind of tedious.  I understand that it's necessary to "evaluate" how well everyone built their ships but it dragged.

I would play this game again - but only with the right group, and I likely wouldn't suggest it even then (as this mythical "right group" would probably play RoboRally with me - and I like that better).

This game could easily be named Mayhem in Space because that's what seems to happen when we play it. First, each player chooses ship components as quickly as they can from the pile in the middle of the table. Will you add extra crew compartments or lots of engines? How about guns along the front or maybe the sides and rear? And don't forget to add a few cargo bays so you can deliver some goods and earn some cash! It seems like that one ship component you need...was just picked by the player to your right! And that's just the ship building phase. Now head out into deep space as a convoy and do your best to survive all the pirates and meteors and challenges that space has to offer. Lots of interactive fun, especially when you arrive at your destination and your ship is one third the size as when you set out.

RATING: 5
I was very excited about this game, as I enjoy real-time mechanics.  However, this game fell flat. Basically an experienced player can know what the ideal layout is and just quickly reveal and aim for those specific tiles while less experienced players are still trying to figure out a good layout.  I think a tile-drafting desing like 7 Wonders, where you each pass around Scrabble-like trays of tiles and must take and play one tile each turn, would have been a better design.  After that part, the game basically plays itself as you reveal different events and see what happens - boring.

I love building the ship; I'm an engineer, so puzzles and quick-thinking really appeal to me.  

But, the flight stage is b-o-r-i-n-g... I know that it's supposed to be exciting to see your ship get blown to bits, but i have a LOT more fun building than flying.  Also, I've only ever had one ship that got somewhat destroyed.  I guess the game isn't any fun if your ship never has problems.  

Sure, I could get the expansion to make the flight more difficult, but I don't want to spend money on such a light game.  Furthermore, I've tried enacting some house rules to make the flight more difficult (i.e. every player must announce whether or not they are going to use a batter BEFORE the dice are rolled to resolve where the threat is coming from), but flight still feels like a chore.

Nevertheless, this is a fantastic game for newbies and gateway gamers.  Everyone that I have introduced it to loves it!  It's definitely worth the price for the fun factor, but replayability IS an issue.

Getting one crucial rule wrong caused me to hate this game initially (we didn't move ships back by the numbers on each event card).  Now, even though I not terribly good at building the ships quickly, I thoroughly enjoy this title.  Having to not only build quickly but wisely is a great mechanic and the event cards are spread out enough to warrant multiple strategies as you find your self limited during ship builds.

Purely in terms of mechanics, I'm not convinced this game is a 9. For mechanics its probably an 8, which you wouldn't believe on a first play.

Even on a first game, you can see what a fantastic amount of fun this game is, and I hope that the fun of the game can stand the test of time.

Have only played basic game from Big Box, which seems interesting enough on its own already (ie no need to rush into expansions yet). Time limit kills AP, which can be of huge benefit. I can't understand why some people like only the building part or only the racing part as both are quite good and can involve some interesting decision making. I suspect that the expansions will help with replayability, which seems ok to me already. By the way, just out of interest, I came across Galaxy Trucker and Suburbia as a result of studying the highly rated games by Race for the Galaxy devotees (ie 10/10), as I also consider RFTG as possibly the very best game, but do wish to maintain variety in gaming. This approach seems to have worked.

Playing this game is a lot of fun. Building the spaceship is similar to Factory Fun as many have mentioned. The way the game is set up is nice since you have three rounds with increasingly complex ships which you need to prepare for the journey to outer space. The journey can be a bit boring. With our game somebody got ahead and stayed there. For others the game went to hell. It was funny watching the spaceships fall apart but there was really no contest for the winner for any of the rounds.

The Android app is great; I would buy this if I saw it for a great price, but it's not a priority currently as there are other games and the app does quite nicely.  I suspect it will be very different to play in person with a physical copy, however.  

This is a game of fun, frantic scrambling to optimize your ship made of junk, and do your best to deal with random hazards.  These hazards, drawn from a deck, will surely upset some of the gamers who make it a rule that "random events" are a bad game mechanic.  I think random events can mar an otherwise strategic game, sometimes, but in this case, mitigating the effects of these events with clever building (and a few choices in a push-your-luck capacity) is the entire game, and I think that's perfectly fine.

Ennél a résznél ki kell emelni, hogy nem körökre osztott, hanem minden játékos egyszerre építkezik egy közös kupacból aminek legtöbbször káosz és kapkodás lesz a vége, hiszen mindenki a legrövidebb idő alatt szeretné a legjobban megépíteni az űrhajóját. Ezután az általunk megépített űrhajóval kell különböző küldetéseket megoldanunk az utazásunk során. Nyerő stratégia nincs, tökéletes hajót gyakorlatilag lehetetlen építeni, sok esetben már az is sikerként könyvelhető el, ha a játék végére egybe marad a hajónk és nem esik egy kalóztámadás vagy egy meteoreső áldozatává...

Constructing your ship under time pressure is fun and...that's about it.  The rest---which is most of the game---is just watching stuff happen to your ship.  This lack of player activity through most of the game just turned me off, so it's no longer in my collection.

Just funny to watch the results as they pour out.  The slower "results" phase isn't that dragged out so it keeps just enough pressure to make it fun.  I think I prefer playing with the expansions though as the base game alone can get stale.

The games a bit random, mostly against me sniff, but it is something that is just generally fun.

For lighthearted fun, there's little better. Enough tactics to keep gamers engauged, but light enough to fill the relaxing 'beer and pretzels' nook which so many aim for.

One of the better games I own, which hits the table surprisingly often as a 'last of night' (and even more surprising, as a 'first choice') option.

love the idea of ransacking a junkyard to build a ship which falls apart as you fly. Liked it enough that I got really good at it, which was a serious downside to getting play, as this is not a game that many try to be good at...solved by rough roads ahead, and the self-handicapping. 

Shadenfreude: the game. Don't care if I win or lose, as long as somebody or everybody (including me!) blows up spectacularly. It's not the destination, it's the bumpy, comic, seat-of-your-pants ride.

I am just crazy about this game. I love the unique design and game play, and the way the different aspects come together so neatly. You want to build your ship fast, but you also want to build it well, and the values of the different types of ship parts are balanced to the types of obstacles you encounter. I also really like the myriad components, very nicely done, except those little green battery tokens are a pain to pick up.

Another game that I loved when I first played, and loved a lot.  Feel like the game is beatable in its basic form.  I'd like to try the expansion for more chaos.

Eventually you will get so good (as will everyone else) that the fun part -- the chaotic flight where your ship gets bashed to bits -- just is a leisurely pleasure cruise.

Adding a 5th player and lots of tough cards seems like a good way to go too.  Will have to wait and see.

 Galaxy Trucker: The Big Expansion (2008)

RATING: 9
Yeah, this one is just pure fun. A bit stressful building your ship, but it's a wild ride. Make the best puzzle you can in about the same time as your fellow space adventurers, then test how it holds up to the rigours of a space journey.

Less fun if the players aren't pushing the pace. Errors and poor ship design = more fun.

Needs the right crowd to enjoy it. This one has fallen flat with people who already have enough stress in their daily lives and are looking for something fun. Which is interesting because the game is only fun if you're not taking it too seriously and are looking for fun.

We like to trash talk other players and their engineering skills as we make silent noises while their ship pieces fly off. In space no one can hear you scream, but you are allowed to scream if an epidemic hits you twice during the same flight.

Rule reminder: If a card effect says you have to give up goods and you don't have enough then you lose batteries instead.

I absolutely love this game.  Unfortunately, it is a bit heavy on explaining the rules to new gamers.  On top of that, the first game can be discouraging when the nooby's ship gets completely devastated. 

However, if the group has played before, the game is fast paced and is hillarious.  

There are challenging decisions mixed with a bit of luck with a fantastic theme.  Solid components.

I tend to dislike real time elements in games. If you play with someone who has played a few times before, prepare to use a ramshackle, convoluted, jumbled junk heap to compete with their star cruiser. I'm also pretty bad at the spatial element of building your ship. I can do it, but I'm not good at rotating the pieces in my head, which makes the real time element hit me harder than it hits others.

It's everything I want in a game. Ship building requires a great deal of skill, and since there is never enough time to build the perfect ship, you will spend the whole building phase panicking and flailing about, and your ship will ultimately look pretty terrible. Which is hilarious.

Then the flight will begin, and either you will watch your ship be blown to bits, which is even more hilarious, or you will beat the odds and end up turning a profit, at which point you can feel proud of yourself.

Galaxy Trucker is immensely fun whether you win or lose, and that makes it the perfect board game.

RATING: 3
I really thought I'd like Galaxy Trucker before I played it. I thought building a ship under time pressure would be fun, and seeing it torn apart ([i]or managing to survive[/i]) through asteroid bombardment and pirate battles would be a blast ([i]bad pun intended[/i]). But, it just didn't do anything for me. I found both portions of the game very dry and uninteresting. I didn't have any sense of attachment to my ship so I didn't care too much about how well it fared in its journey. I've also found that, in general, I appear to dislike games where you build something up only to have others ([i]or the game[/i]) tear it down. I actually disliked the experience enough to do something I almost never do - I stopped playing after the first round. I still feel bad about that but, fortunately, a player leaving really doesn't have an impact on the other people playing the game, or I would have kept playing regardless of how little I enjoyed it. I think I'll be unlikely to try it again.

While I thought I would have a good time with this, it was a lot more fun than I really expected it to be.  Building the ships is easily the biggest, most time consuming part of the game for us as no one wants to flip the timer.  Then we get to fly it across the galaxy.  Watching ships get dinged apart by giant space rocks and pot shots from combat zones is a real hoot.  It almost doesn't matter who wins.  [11/12/2008]

This game is ridiculously awesome. It has two problems:

- It's less fun if players have different skill levels. Although the game has a silly, somewhat random feel, it rewards skill overwhelmingly.

- If you get too good at it, your ship often doesn't suffer much damage at all.

Both these are helped quite a bit by the Big Expansion, which lets you increase the difficulty and allows handicaps.

The only downside to this game is the amount of bits that need to be setup and the amount of table space required. Once that is taken care of the game is a blast. Real time use of spatial awareness is not good for everyong. I am average at this type of thing and enjoy the challenge. The game is not meant to be taken seriously though and it is amusing to see how the best constructed ships can be torn apart by unfortunate card draws.

RATING: 6.7
Galaxy Trucker -- Played three- and four-player.  The components are just so [i][b]fun[/b][/i]!  The batteries are like dilithium tic tacs.  And the other components foster a whimsical feel, without ignoring practical concerns.  For example, the crew tokens are downright cute; and they're small enough to fit on their compartments, and squat enough that they're not likely to fall over.

I found that I really enjoyed this game, but I was also concerned that the play is much more involving for those in the lead.  There's a silly, haphazard, [i]light[/i] quality to Galaxy Trucker that precludes any real satisfaction in winning, but that's not why one plays this game.  It's not about winning -- it's about [i]surviving[/i]!  And for me, it's the crazy components, the Sanford and Son spaceships, that draws me to play.

Gaining the lead is arguably too powerful, and since no ship can have all the components in just the right places, building a slapdash ship quickly to take the leader position may be as valid a strategy as constructing a strong, fast, cargo-hold-heavy, well-crewed, well-shielded ship.  Of course, not [i]too[/i] slapdash.  But you may want to prognosticate (look at the cards) to determine which ship components to focus on and, if you're in a hurry to finish your ship first, let some other components go.

I won a game by abandoning ship* before the really nasty stuff hit, so the win wasn't very satisfying.  But I stayed involved as banker/dice-roller/announcer of doom.  

So why is my rating lukewarm?  There are some games I'll play almost any time.  This game I enjoy quite a bit, but only when I'm in the mood for something haphazard.

*Okay, I didn't exactly abandon ship.  I used almost all my crew to get significant coin, thereby taking the risk that another card might demand more crew than I had.  I had seen lots of demand for crew during the construction phase (thanks to Corporation Incorporated's prognostics division), so I knew there was a very high likelihood I'd lose my crew.  I just decided to profit from them before losing them.  (Apparently I'm an evil, evil Corporation Inc. employee!)

Looks like something of Tales of Arabian Night vibe, minus the stories, meaning: no true decisions, relaxed laid back ride with no interactions apart from laughing at each other. Each person plays on their own, first against time to build a ship, then against the random event deck. In short: looks like fun meaningless nonconfrontational activity to pass some quality time with your friends.

EDIT: Scares new players! Oh well. Best with laid back attitude.

I played the android version to see if I would enjoy the physical version. The android version is done very well and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in this game. That said, I did not care much for the game itself.  The game feels like someone tried combining two smaller games to make a new game. There is a building game followed by a card drawing game.  Both phases are moderately entertaining but I feel it would have been a lot more fun if the two phases could have somehow been integrated more. For example, instead of simply building a ship for the anticipated card drawing stage, I would rather have to draw cards and then be given a building option based on the card that was turned up. That would have added more strategy and tactics to the process. As it is now, you build a ship based on what you think might happen, then just draw cards to see how it performs. So the first phase is a lot of guessing what you might need for the second phase, and then the second phase is mainly sit back to see if you did a good job.

cada jugador tiene que contruir su propia nave, cogiendo las piezas del centro de la mesa (están boca abajo).
Una vez que se termine el tiempo, se mandan al espacio, y vann pasando cosas, como lluvias de meteoritos, ataques de piratas estelares, planetas donde se pueden cargar mercancias para conseguir puntos de victoria, ect...
El juego tiene 2 partes muy diferenciadas:
La primera, en la que tienes que montar la nave, muy estrasante, por que vés que el tiempo corre, y que los demás jugadores también.
Y una segunda, donde solo tienes que mirar como tú nave y la de los demás, van pasando por un montón de calamidades.
Le veo poca rejugabilidad, y hay jugadores que se les dá demasiado bien (puede pasar con juegos como el Ubongo).

I adore real-time puzzle games. If I were rating games based on sheer fun factor, this would be close to the very top, if not #1. I love the stress of trying to build that perfect ship, but it never seems to turn out as you want. And then the reveal of the cards as you hope your ship can remain intact is just gravy. Absolutely always have a blast playing this one. Even when I do poorly and my ship falls apart completely, it's still hilarious.

The ship-building aspect is fantastic, especially when chaos ensues and you look down at a wonky ship only to realize you have a wing that's nothing but energy cells. I wish I could play with people of multiple skill levels (and interest in rules minutae) more easily.

RATING: 8.5
Fun games that meshes the crazy tile-building frenzy of Factory Fun with a Starfarers of Catan exploration card system. Players tool up ships (adding crew, power, specialists, gun, shields etc) and try to survive various card-driven encounters. Ships get bigger and the player who gets most $$$ from shipping, trading, defeating pirates etc wins!

The game clips along nicely and it's great fun to see ships fall apart.

I have the Android version. This is really cool and really interesting, and I would like to play it more, but 1) Michelle hates the timer, for obvious reasons, 2) I can't stand how long she takes in the turn-based building mode, and 3) I pretty much only have time for games I can finish in 40ish minutes or less these days, and I can't even manage that against the AI.

Half game, half crap. I love the aspect of building the ship. Where to put what and how to link it all together so that you have enough engines, enough cargo space, enough guns and enough crew while ensuring that you have no exposed ports. LOVE IT! Now the next part where you just randomly watch it get busted to pieces with virtually no choices. HATE IT!

RATING: 8
A silly space game with a surprisingly high "fun factor." The initial phase is like The Very Clever Pipe Game, except it's timed and simultaneous. The second phase is a light, fast-playing, exploration and starship management game. I thought I would feel more stressed and pressured with the time element, but it's actually pretty relaxed.

Galaxy Trucker is the closest you get to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in board gaming format. A wacky, chaotic combination of speed game + puzzle game and much more! It can be quite hard for new players to succeed against Trucker veterans (ship building mainly), might be a downside for some..

The building of your ship is the greatest part of this game.  It is such an exciting and competitive time.  Once you start moving into the adventures, though, the excitement dies down a little.  Only in the longer treks of round 2 and 3 do the adventures start to get hair-raising.

Regardless, this is a lot of fun and actually quite simple to learn and play.  It also doesn't have much down time, as a bulk of the game is spent frantically building.

Fun eurotrashy game. Building your ship in real-time is fun, then watching it get blown apart in slow motion is fun. Well, for me anyway. In the 3p game I played, one player absolutely hated the lack of control. I can see that. Try before you buy.

RATING: 7
I am really enjoying this game! Each play is divided into two rather distinct phases. In the first, you and your opponents try to build your space ships from the common pool of components before the time runs out. You are competing here not only on the basis of time, but also for choice components, such as shields and large batteries, which are not plentiful. This part of the game is very reminiscent of Factory Fun (which I also like), and I think it's just a blast. Often, the timer runs out and one or more players haven't really finished their ships, so they just have to run with what they have so far.

The second phase of the game involves everyone's ships trying to make it through a gauntlet of obstacles and encounters to reach a destination. This part of the game can be rather hysterical, as heavy cannon fire can shear off whole wings of ships. Invariably, especially in 4 player games, someone will get blasted to bits or only coast in to the finish on inertia (having had all their engines blasted off), or lose their last crew members to slavers.

There is a fair amount of "strategy" in Galaxy Trucker, both in how you construct your ship, and in where you try to position yourself on the journey (ships in the lead position have more opportunities, but also face more dangers). But really, this game is about having fun with your friends. Galaxy Trucker is well worth the cost. We obtained a copy of Pandemic (a super game) at the same time Galaxy Trucker arrived in our house, and when it is just the two of us, my wife has been choosing Galaxy Trucker.

The components are generally good quality, and their variety and abundance  explains the price tag. A few of the ship pieces tore a little on being punched out of their frame, which is irritating. I was careful too. Oh well. The box is also not a very good one. I bought the game brand new, and the sides of the box are already bowing. These are quibbles, though, and shouldn't keep you from acquiring this outstanding game.

Amazing twist on the tile laying genre. Ship building is a blast. Theme and mechanisms function well together, particularly in the ship building phase. Rulebook has been injected with humor. Second half of the game is OK, but there are limited meaningful decisions. Feels like the game is on rails after your ship is built. Still, a great game.

A tökéletes partyjáték. Építs űrhajót majd bánkódj rajta hogyan esik szét az űrben. LEGO kedvelőként az űrhajó összerakási rész már levett a lábamról. Kis négyzet alakú lapokból rakjuk össze az űrhajót mindenki egyszerre! Nagy ötlet az egyszerre építés, meglepően hangzik, mégis jól működik. Ha készen vannak az űrhajók, lehet indulni meghódítani a világűrt. Még a legjobban összerakott hajó sem mehet biztosra. Egymás után esnek le a darabok a hajókról igazán vicces helyzeteket okozva, ez teszi az egyik leghangulatosabbá ezt a játékot.

I can't put my finger on it, but this game just does not make me care about it. It feels very non-competitive to me, solitairish, puzzlish, and it all adds up to me not really caring all that much what happens to my ship.

It's a cool design and I can recognize that and appreciate it, so I'm pretty sure this is just a case of "not for me"

A fun game filled with agonizing moments as you watch your carefully crafted ship suffer horrible indignities.
Update: I moved my rating up a point. Almost everyone loves it after one play.

This is a polarizing game. Strictly, for those that want to see what happens, and not for those that want to react and change their future.

Cobble a ship together.

Sit back and see what happens to it.

There is a minor amount of pushing your luck. Most of the game is to see if your ship can take a beating better than other players.

Random and frustrating.  Little control.  Poor get poorer. Not much "game" to speak of. Worst of all because there is so little to actually do after building the ship, it's rather boring.

The more I think about it the more I dislike Galaxy Trucker. It's weird, because I am a fan of experience games and will give them all the slack that they need, but it's just too random (with both tiles, cards and rolls), little interaction or real decisions within the game itself and is topped of with just about zero narrative. Ugh.

Unique and interesting, but the fun ends once you've built your ship.  It feels kind of weird for all of your decision-making to happen in the first 2 minutes of the game round, and then you just sit there for the other 10 minutes of the round to "see what happens to you".  A little too much luck for me. But still, fun enough for my non-gamer wife to play.

It's been a while since I've been dying to play a board game after playing it once. This game is chaotic-random fun.

It's a great non-serious fun game.

A fun game, with lots of Chvatil-style fiddliness and fumbling. It's probably too complicated for most non-gamers to enjoy the first time, which is a shame, because so much of it is very appealing and intuitive. This is definitely a game that is all about the journey--winning is virtually accidental. If you're going to be very upset when half of your carefully-crafted ship goes floating off into space (and into the debit column of your balance sheet), then it's probably best not to play at all.

Love this mad crazy build your own spaceship and watch it die game. Sadly, my wife does not, so it doesn't get enough playtime. (You shoulda heard the word she used when our kid took the one piece she wanted for her ship. And normally she's such a polite person. It's that kind of a game.)

If you dislike randomness or goofy humor this is probably not for you. I mean, there is some skill involved, but all your brilliant plans can come asunder because of some nasty die rolls. I've hard about people playing this game very seriously, calculating odds, etc. Those are bad people, I don't want to know them.

"Galaxy Trucker" is highly random, which I usually don't enjoy, but my dislike of it is born from something else. I'll call it the "3/5/7/ gameplay. 

First round attempt to prepare your ship with 3 of each system, as desired. Enemies will require 3 weapons, so make sure you have 3 weapons. 

In the next round enemies will require 5, and in the final round 7.

Once you discover that all system types follow this general guideline it spoils the the ship building aspect and makes each game feel relatively the same.

I heard some previews and read the rules before this game came out and thought it sounded interesting. When I saw the first photos and realized that the pieces were molded plastic - and not cardboard punch-outs - I was sold. The only problem with this game is that it feels like a beer and pretzels game but the rules are far too involved for that type of game. Due to the real-time aspect, you have to spend a very long time making sure everyone clearly understands all the rules when introducing new players.

There is lots of randomness in this one, so this is one you don't play to win, you play to have fun.  It is fun as a pleasant change of pace, but it will never become a staple of mine, as it's not totally my cup of tea.  It's also a bit too long - two rounds instead of three is probably the right length.

UPDATE: It's not overly long, but I still find this quite frustrating.  If it were a bit less expensive, I think it would be worth owning, since the theme may appeal to Joseph someday.

UPDATE #2: Moving up there, but still can't see myself wanting to play this all the time.

Half game, half random mayhem. The ship-building part is kind of fun despite the fact that it's a puzzle -- mostly because it's a relatively easy puzzle. The time pressure also makes it kind of fun. Then you just sit back and watch the random destruction that happens when you flip through the encounter cards.

The components are all pretty good, except for:
- the box insert has crappy cardboard dividers: ours were warped when we broke the shrink! There aren't even enough compartments to be able to give each type of bit (and each denomination of money) its own space
- the cards are pretty bad: they seem like just coated card stock, without a nice linen finish. Also, in the BRAND NEW game, color is coming off the edges of the cards already!

--- Summary ---
The first half (of each round) everyone races to build a spaceship made of various pieces (cabins for crew, guns, cargo holds, engines, shields, and batteries to power certain pieces). Unlike most puzzles, where you may have hundreds of similar-shaped pieces to look through to find the one piece you need, here you can put each piece in several different places. Your placements are only limited by simple connection and placement rules -- i.e., single- and double- connectors may only connect with like connectors or universal connectors; can't have a piece directly behind the engine or in front of a gun, etc. The ship needs to be as solid as possible (no free connectors sticking out) and built to withstand the random series of events in the 2nd half. These include pirates (fight with your cannons), meteor showers, planets to stop at and pick up goods, etc, many events costing you time. It's a race to the end, with faster players earning more money. But you also then sell the goods you've managed to collect. Most money after 3 rounds wins.

This has been on my radar for some time. Got my first trial game in this evening.  Had a blast...literally.  My first ship was annihilated, destroyed, obliterated on the second card draw of the game by!  Had me laughing out loud, which is what I was hoping this game would do.  A genuinely funny game by the look of it.  My initial rating is 8.  Could go up or down but after one play...I like it.

Update: played a couple of times now.  For some reason the last time I played it I didn't enjoy it at all, and I have no idea why.  7.

Rating after 1 play, so grain of salt territory here.  It felt a little bit too long for what it was, and the fast-paced frantic part of the game was balanced out by the bits that seemed to drag a little too long.

Still, it *was* reasonably fun, and I think it's one of those games that my opinion would improve if I played it again.  With so many games to choose from, however, it's rare I'm inclined to try something a second time if the first didn't wow me.

Boy, am I glad I sprung for the Anniversary Edition of this game.  Not only because it seems to have sold out and gone out of print quickly making my copy a little more valuable (despite the fact I can't imagine myself parting with it) but because I absolutely love this game and am glad to get everything printed for it in one go.

The game is simple and easy to teach people, at least if you start from the base game and introduce the expansions slowly.  You grab tiles and put them on your space ship to make the most well-balanced ship you can.  The rules for where you can put pieces and how they have to connect are the hardest to explain and for new players to grasp but once they've got that down everything else should be easy to learn, especially through experience.

The next step is simply putting your ship through the ringer.  This is where the most learning comes in, you start to discover how much cannon power you really need (hint: it's more than you thought), how many batteries you really need (hint: it's less than you thought), how many crew members, engines, etc. and what the array of possible obstacles is.  You can't really throw this at everyone during the learning stage if they aren't willing to look up the rules themselves, so trial by fire is really the best way to play.  We had one player who after the first two races HATED the game and just wanted it to be over but by the end of the last race was actually asking to play it again because he had learned the ropes a little bit more and had had fun despite still getting mutilated in the final race.

That's the greatness of the game to me, too.  The fun is in putting together your ship and I love it whether I win that leg of the race victoriously or get completely demolished.  It's almost more fun to get destroyed and watch your ship break apart in the vastness of open space.

This is one I can see myself pushing on people for quite a long time, it is such an enjoyable experience (for me at least) win or horribly, horribly lose.

Great real-time game.  I'm generally not keen on real-time games, but the "race to build a ship" mechanic doesn't really hurt gameplay.  To play this game in a turn-based fasion would be torture, and besides, once everybody has played a few games of Galaxy Trucker everyone knows what they're looking for when they're building.  The first game I played, I didn't like it.  After another play I knew what I was doing, and the game became much more exciting.

This game is serious fun to me and I love it. Simple!

RATING: 7
A unique twist to board games - a real time game! The game is surprisingly fun in my opinion as you try to build the best ship possible. I find it even more fun if you just simply watch other players build their ships frantically and get destroyed during the event phase.

A lot of the fun comes from surviving through the events - you will actually find more enjoyment when not one - but everyone is being destroyed by meteors or raided by attackers.

The game does have it limitations as the uniqueness of the game quickly dies off - you will find that you will be using the same pieces over and over until they become stale. Also, the events while at first may seem numerous - they are actually very little unique events. You will always be pretty much doing the same events - landing on planets, defending from raiders and avoiding meteors.

Most of my points come from how unique the game is - while it does quickly lose its shine (like most other games), it can remain a fun game if you and your group have an epic time during the event phase.

What a great idea for a game! You build your own space ship and then try to fly it. Half the fun is watching your ship get blown to bits by lasers and asteroids.

My new favourite game. How could anyone not like Galaxy Trucker??

Well, I know how someone could not like it... there's little strategy other than "try to get the best ship you can", and once the game starts it's really just reacting to all the horrible stuff that gets thrown your way.

But really, watching your ship get blown to a million pieces is incredibly fun. You wouldn't think it would be, but it is!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Making the ships is awesome.  Flying the ships could be better.  

Its an interesting game, because it could have been one of the best games ever, but its killed by the fact that you don't make a lot of decisions when you fly the ships.  SO you sit there and watch your ships be blown apart, which is fun.  But it is all too passive.  You should be able to react more when flying, so that the same panicky feeling that you get while building is maintained.  

Its also too long if you play by the full rules and I would recommend picking a ship and making one flight.  Then if you feel it, start a new game and pick a different set of options.  Fling three ships in a row and totaling is suboptimal fun.

I went through a period where this problem turned me off, but I've recently come back to the game, and it is pretty good.  You can get through the flight quickly once you get used to it.  The expansions improve the game.

Worth owning.

After several plays I've revised my rating from a 9 down to a 6--a huge drop but there is little desire to play it all anymore.  It suffers from a fun and interesting gimick which in the end is still just a gimick.

This is one game we play where it really doesn't matter who wins--it's all about the experience. Building spaceships and getting them blown up, what could be more fun than that?

When I saw the length of the rulebook, I was afraid it was going to be too much for my 6yo and 8yo to play, but to my surprise, my 8yo was so interested in the game that she sat down and read through the whole rulebook before I did and taught us how to play! It's become one of her favorite games, and one of the few that she's even willing to play with her brother.

I've discovered the secret recipe for this game: take Roborally, add a dollop of Ubongo, mix in a lump of Speed Scrabble, sprinkle on a pinch of Alhambra, and bake on high for about an hour.  Delicious!!  Galaxy Trucker is what I like to call an "Experience Game", which is perfect because I am what I like to call an "Experience Gamer" - that is, I take pleasure in the joy of playing, not just in the mental exercise of working through strategies.  This is certainly not a heavily strategic game, and you are certainly at the mercy of a lot of randomness.  (Really, it's more of a puzzle game than anything.)  But that's okay, because it's fun!  And although there are a lot of little bits of information to learn from the outset, it's quite a simple game when you know how all the parts form to create the whole.  The game itself has some cool, unique-looking bits, although I think they could have done even more with those aliens and the plastic ship markers.  Over all, I'd have to say that playing Galaxy Trucker is an enjoyable experience, though perhaps a little too much effort to set up for what the game play provides.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 6.5/10

Good theme play.  Game is fairly easy to learn and play.  Fun game.  It will take a couple of plays to get the knack of building your ships.  Somewhat of a luck element despite how well your ship is built.  Components are very good - colorful mounted board, thick cardboard chits, plastic playing pieces, somewhat durable cards with fair artwork.  The rulebook is OK.  It is in color and has examples, but it is set up to teach players how to play and a poor reference.  Game length is about 2 hours which feels right.

[4 plays] It is an okay filler game.  On one hand I like the whole idea of quickly building the spaceship and then having it go through the adventure to see how it does.  On the other hand it fells like there is a lot of chaos to the whole ship building, and the adventure to see how the ship does felt like a mindless exercise of luck.  Overall I do have fun playing this game every once in a while.  The timers are crap... I have now played with two different copies of the game and both have poor sand timers.

RATING: 7
[Czech Games 07 Edition] {Space; real-time, dice-rolling, utility cards, modular board; optimal 4p} Galaxy Trucker is an interesting family game.  It needs some time to teach the rules - a player aid or cheat sheet to illustrate the function of each component and each kind of event adventure card is preferred.  The game time is a little bit long (may last over an hour) but it is still acceptable.

The first part of a round is particularly fun, in which players rush to build a good spaceship for the adventure.  The second part is less interesting.  There are tactical decisions for the both parts - players have to smartly build a ship and choose what to do for each adventure card. The second part of the game can also be fun if players can imagine they are adventuring in a galaxy.  

For me the biggest problem of this game is that there are almost no linkages between the 3 rounds.  Therefore, there is no long-term planning.  Some players say that the second part is a little bit scripted after everyone has built their spaceships but I haven't experienced similar problems so far.

The components are top class. The plastic figures are very cute and colorful. The illustration is funny. Very good production value.

I am very happy that I own this game. It is really a good family game for casual play.

[Expansion cards] The expansion cards are nasty! It makes the game more fun when all players are familiar with the basic game.  I am looking forward to trying them.

That's a nice ship you have there :) it would be a shame if the game surgically removed the single piece in the middle keeping it together.

Welcome to Galaxy Trucker, where spacemen get sucked into the cold void, smugglers steal your cargo and pirates blow up what's left while you desperately try to keep as much of your ship intact while racing for the finish. Great fun, usually plays in under an hour, easy to explain and near impossible to master; just make sure that - if your friends are as competitive as mine - everybody knows what they're getting into; I can see how some people can feel disheartened when the game just kind of decides your ship's time is up.

The point of the game is to laugh at your friends as their shiny new spaceship gets blown wide open, their cargo sucked into space, their crew abducted and their engines knocked out and it succeeds admirably. It's the least competitive game ever designed and because of that it works just SO WELL. It's silly, it's cute and it's just a joy to play.

I really, really want to love this game. It just seems like so much fun. Maybe I havent played it with the right people, but I feel like I never will. 

I love the theme, the mechanics, and the idea of the whole thing. It just bombed in my group. I need to find a solo variant because I want to play it more, hell, I need to play it more (I paid good money for it!).

With the right group, this would be a solid 9 or 10. With my group, it wasnt fun and I would give it a 6, or even a 5. But I (and I seem to be the only one I know who does) just think its awesome! So it gets a 7 due to its heavy reliance on being played with the right people at the right time.

Initial rating after a couple plays.  I'm hopeful it could move up using the full four players, but I feel like it tries to do two things and falls a little short with both.  Maybe we play slow but it takes a while to build the ships making the subsequent flights seem short and anticlimatic in comparison.

Really fun game, but is pretty random. The Sabotage card is really annoying and can completely shut you down and ruin your game if it hits at a core inner area. There is also a decent amount of "downtime" when running through all the event cards. Still a fun game that I enjoy, but the first half is a lot more interesting than the second half.

I'm sure the fast moving puzzle style ship building followed by highly random disasters will be unappealing to many.  I think its great!  Building the ship is a lot of fun; its a planning and spatial challenge to get all your pieces in, and involves tricky decisions about what you should focus on and what to skip.  The journey is fraught with frustration - but each flip of the card is filled with suspense!  My record getting clobbered so far?  A ship with nothing left but one cargo hold!  Plays ok with 2 players, much more interesting with 4.
Problem after repeat plays; once you've got the hang of it, its too easy to build highly effective ships, and offers very little opportunity to pull ahead - a player who starts with the worse ship will just do worse the whole trip.  However, 'rough road ahead' and custom variants make it exciting again!

If you were like me and threw your toys against the wall when you were little to see when and how they would break apart, then this game is for you.

I love building up things and watching them get destroyed, it is a ton of fun.  

In the end, I got rid of it because my wife did not like the destruction of something she built, and the actually trucking part of flying your ship got boring.

I really enjoy this game.  There's a lot of thoughts going on when trying to pull together your ship, and it definitely gets better with each play as people become more and more secure with the rules of what's going on.  We play with only a few parts of the various expansions, but I'm sure we'll include additional expansion tiles and other elements as time passes on!

RATING: 7
Highly original space transportation game. It takes place over three rounds each divided into two very different phases. The first is a frantic effort to build your space ship that entails blindly picking component tiles and trying to make them fit which is all done against the clock. The second phase is where you attempt to fly your ship and watch it fall apart as you encounter various hazards whilst trying to collect and deliver goods for victory credits. Like a lot of designer Vlaada Chvátil's games it doesn't feel like any other game you'll ever play and doesn't take itself too seriously either. Others have said that they much prefer the building phase to the transportation phase but the former only makes sense when combined with the latter. The game does feel a bit too random at times, especially during the build phase when you cannot obtain the components you desperately need for your ship whilst your opponents seem to miraculously keep turning over the ones they require (which are often the ones you want too), but it goes against the nature of the game to become too frustrated with it, it's got far too much charm to allow that to happen.

Played a friends copy at last gaming night. After an introduction round where we got used to the 'real-time puzzling' (and knowing what you need on your space-ship) we started for real.

Went smooth and straight for the first two rounds, getting tied with my more experienced friend for the win going into third round.

Made one construction copy so a third of my ship never left the hangar and from there on it all went downhill and managed to finish dead last. Never had so much fun losing a game. Laughed until I had tears in my eyes upon the total destruction of my proud 'vessel' that got hammered on, beaten, shot at and pounded until there was only one alien with life support and some pipes left (forcing me to give up and start waiting on Sigorny Weaver).

Brilliant concept, makes me long to have my own copy.

Delightful game. Once the rules are squared away, it plays quickly and gets everyone invested. From reviews I was expected the actual "trucking" portion to be a little underwhelming, but I found that my friends were glued to our boards as we watched our creations get rattled with meteorites and cannons and diseases and so forth.

It's a quite elegantly designed game with an absolutely fantastic rulebook loaded with jokes and farcical in-world rationalizations for various rules and gameplay suggestions.

I wish it could take five players, just because that's the sweet-spot number for people wanting to play a given game in my particular gaming group, but there's always the expansion.

First play through was interesting but it will take a couple more games for me to figure out how much I play the game or it plays me.  As others have stated this game is more to have fun - if you are a player that plays to win and hates random chance keeping you from winning - just stay away.

If you want to just sit down and enjoy a game and watch as your ship falls apart...  you will have a great time.  Just come to the table with the right attitude.

An experiential game, not unlike Arkham Horror, but far better designed. The timed tile laying extremely disadvantages those not spatially oriented. As a spatial puzzle, Factory Fun is far superior. The complete reset of ships between rounds removes any RPG-like character building. IF you have the desire and imagination to imagine yourself a space trucker (and somehow with that imagination, need a game as an aid to your imagination) you may want to replay this game; otherwise, not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An interestingly chaotic game about flying monkeys through space in ships made of mismatched patchwork plastic plumbing.  How can you not love that theme.  The game itself is basically 2 separate light filler games that blend seamlessly together.  The first half involves a mad scramble for Carcassonne style tiles. As spaceship construction is done in real-time, the pressure and the necessity to build a functional ship on a timer against other players will either delight or mortify players.  It's a lot of fun, but as long as you aren't the sort to have to spend a long time thinking about tile placements and can think on your feet. It's overall an interesting time sensitive puzzle game that involves making high risk choices and split second decisions. 

Then the game begins.  A large part of the fun is flying your monkey driven junk pile through space and praying to your space primate gods that the duct tape holds.  This is an event driven race game for the most part, rife with interstellar peril.  Depending on your attachment to all that hard work you put into the frantic first half, the last section of the game will either endear you to this title or cause you to absolutely hate it.  All those titles you fought for and struggled to strategically placed are about to be hurtled through the galaxy with a high chance they will be blown to smithereens. Watching these fates befall your opponents will of course result in considerable laughter and amusement.

At the end of the day, Galaxy Trucker is a frustrating but overall fun game. Theres certainly a high level of skill, which you will pick up the more you play it.  The first play is likely going to be a bad experience for most, but a second or third play will give this one time to shine.  It's certainly a unique game that deserves a few plays to appreciate even if you can't handle a little misfortune and pressure.

The building of the space ships is fun. Love all the bits. Playing the game doesn't seem to have enough going on to make it worth it for me to spend the time building. I think I need to play with a different strategy to enjoy this one (i.e. build fast and make everyone else build fast so that no one has perfect ships). Also, just played as 2-player which may also have something to do with it...feels like there should be more people playing.

Its a timed puzzle game against other players in real time. When you each finish, there is a bit of random chaos that pits each ship against a handful of random events that test each of your ships. Then you repeat twice more on progressively "harder" boards. Its goofy, very random and pretty fun.

** After playing the turn-based version on iOS, I've come to the conclusion that I prefer that method of play and also in letting the CPU handle the events. Not dying to sit down and play real time. The chaos is fun, but also make me less interested in the time to play three races.

What a crazy game. The building phase is interesting, but not nearly as tense as I thought it would be. Perhaps my opponents were not as adamant about pushing the time limits as they should have been, but I typically felt as though the time limit was a bit of a non-issue. I needed to be quick, but it wasn't dire. All that said, once your ship is built, you put your fate in the hands of a random deck of cards. So be it. As a zany game that is mostly a puzzle about building your ship, Galaxy Trucker is somewhat enjoyable. As anything more, I'll pass. I can't believe there are so many expansions! I see no need for any of them. The base game is already a tad too complicated for what it is.

This is a fun and slightly frantic game of building a spaceship that will survive the rigors of an upcoming trip.  Generally speaking, I'm not a big fan of the slapjack mechanism (where everyone may be reaching for the same stuff at the same time.  It works pretty well in this game (and in Factory Fun, which has a very similar feel).  You have to balance offense, defense, carrying capacity, energy storage, and other factors in building the ship, not the least of which is whether or not a piece even fits!

I really didn't like my first play. Then years later I felt I was ready to try it again, and I liked it more. I think this game has a very fun part (building the ship) and a boring part (auto piloting through the cards).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another fantastic Vlaada game.  I'm a very visual/spatial person and an engineer by trade, so the ship construction may be the most interesting aspect of any board game I've played.  Trying to match the connectors while optimizing ship components while under the clock is pure heaven for me.  I've heard complaints that piloting the ships is a total let down after ship construction, but I enjoy both aspects of the game.  Rating could increase to a coveted 10 after more plays.

Update: My last few games have fallen a bit flat.  I'm too good at it and none of my friends can compete.  If I had the expansion(s) and a regular group to play it, this could be a 10 for me.  But until that happens, I can only give it an 8.

This game is just plain fun.

However, in order to like you should be able to laugh if your well-built ship is turned into trash. Furthermore it defintely has no catch-up mechanism, quite the contrary, if you are alredy lying the game will kick you again and again ;) Therefore you shouldn't take it too seriousely.

Update
Still a 10, however this game has another problem, if one of the players knows the game well he can win easily since he can build ships with won't he affected by the bad cards and he is usually faster than the other players. However, just use the  print-to play expansion (also included in the big expansion) to give him a handicap. Problem solved.

Another update:
I still have the same opinion about the game, but I'm updating my ratings so that they fit the rating guidelines. Therefore an 8.

Update again:
Raised it to a 9. Great game. I'm eagerly awaiting the announced secon expansion.

Fell flat with the group. Takes too long for the randomness involved. Of course, I prepped everyone to expect the randomness, and to not take it too seriously, but that lasts only for so long. People were lamenting that we had yet another round to play after the first two...

RATING: 9
How great is this game? I was a bit nervous by the sound of the component grab but it's a less barbaric (fearing Snap! type gameplay!) than I dreaded. After building your ship, knowing your weaknesses and finally raising your head to envy everyone else's - there's always one who manages a perfectly finished uber-vessel, and then flying the mission to see whose ship really does stand up to the test of space flight.
All of this is great fun and real interaction between players. I've played this twice now and both were great. Now having the expansion I'm sure there's extra life, but I'm keeping thescore at 9 until a few more goes to see if it has longevity...

A fun sort of ridiculous game. I wouldn't play it to win because too much of the game depends on the speed of building your ship, the randomness of dice and other things not really in your control. 

Nevertheless, it's a neat concept and a lot of fun, especially if you have a good storyteller narrating the trucker voyage.

Not the game I hoped it would be. Took too long, though maybe we could have sped everything up, we didn't use the timer as beginners.

The most fun came from watching others ships fall apart, and I guess I provided the same laughter to them.

Just not really the "game" I expected. A friend called it "too passive"

RATING: 9
Do you watch Futurama? Of course you do. You know how Professor Farnsworth went through several Planet Express crews before he got one that didn't die? That's basically how this game goes. You are professor Farnsworth, and you are trying to build a ship that protects its occupants from the routine dangers of space trucking.

This is one of those games where you have to play a few times to get any good. But it's funny when you do poorly.

RATING: 7
Quirky, colourful, innovative, and unique (well, spaceship construction is very similar to Space Junk).  There aren't many decisions to be made (mostly risk-management against the clock), but it is great fun to watch a hastily made junker get blown out of the sky (so long as it's not your own).  It's more of a party game specifically designed for strategy gamers than it is a strategy game.  

Maybe it runs a little long for such a chaotic game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fantastic game with a real-time element I finally enjoy. I actually enjoy a lot because it doesn't end up in some sort of stressfull frenzy but in a positive stress to build the best space-ship possible. Great, great rulebook! There should be more like this one. I am usually the person to read the rules and teach friends to play and I can say I had a great time going through the book. Fine humour, nice language skills and great structure. There's lots of luck involved but the game moves fast and you don't you just love to see pirates hit the weak spot of your opponents' ship and have meteor fields tear it to shreds. On the other hand you can also have a blast if it happens to your ship. This game promotes good sportsmanship and provides fun with high quality components. The artwork is stunning and never before have I seen cuter spacemen than in Galaxy Trucker. At a playing time of below an hour this almost hits the filler criteria. We got two plays in two hours including rules explanation. If only you wouldn't want to play this all night long. Will become a favorite of mine in no time, this I am sure of! It really is that good.    

--> Few more games in that make me raise my rating even further by a notch. This is a near perfect game for reasons of a thing simply called fun. Tremendous effort, I'd really play this anytime with any crowd. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After first play, I give this a tentative 8.  Could go up or down with repeated plays, as the first game was only with one other player.  I reckon the game needs to be played with 3-4, as with 2 it was a little easy to make a tighter ship with less chaos.  Still, the game resounds with fun, which is really key in a game--the bottom line is that it is a very enjoyable experience.  There is no sure-fire way to win, as disasters can strike from anywhere.  What makes the game work, in spite of its unpredictable cruelty, is that the disasters are dealt with by everyone playing--no one is immune.  More strategy is present here than at first glance, as are the presence of impactful decisions.  Highly recommended--it is one of the most unique and fun games that I have ever played.  However, if you want complete control of the odds, if you like games to be distilled down to stark strategy, then it likely is not for you.  I would urge anyone to at least give it a try though--doubters will likely still fall for the charm and laughter factors.

Possibly Jackie's favorite game, and one I always like to play.  It's silly, it's chaotic, there's a learning curve (especially once you add the expansions) but there's no denying the laughs and the tension that this game generates.  It's also just a very tight design.  Everything works the way you think it should, and the color-coding on the tiles is subtle but incredibly useful to new players.  
The rulebook is also worth mentioning.  Most Chvatil rules are worth reading carefully.  This one merits being read aloud several times.  It's hilarious.

My initial reaction after one test play is that this is a lot of fun, combining the real time rush of building a workable ship with the knowledge that it could be disastrously wrecked by meteors only a few minutes later.  The game also plays quickly with little need for down time or administration woes, a huge plus for any multiplayer game.

This is a good time. I really like Vlaada's designs in general. I think he's mixed a timing element, a building phase, and a heavy dose of chaos well here.

RATING: 10
I love everything about Galaxy Trucker.  Okay, I do grumble when Deja Vu comes up when using the Rough Roads expansion cards, but I'm still excited on the inside because it means the round will be longer!  The quick strategizing when building a ship under pressure, the randomization of events, the losing every one of your ship's components except a cabin and praying that you'll survive the last three cards in the deck and that none will be Open Space -  Even when you're being blown to smithereens despite your best efforts and planning, you're still having fun and this is what I love most about Galaxy Trucker.

RATING: 7.5
Tons of fun in this simultaneous-play puzzle race thang.  I like both the building phase and the flight phase, as I enjoy watching what happens to the ships as they are slowly (or sometimes not so slowly) torn apart by the mishaps along the way.  Not everyone in my game group is of the same opinion, so it doesn't get a lot of play there - but my daughter loves it, too, so I do get a chance to play now and then.  As with Dungeon Lords, the rules inject a lot of humor - but don't leave you with a game that's just a gimmick.

There's not too much thinking here, but the race to get the parts you want and finish first, combined with the (often self-) schadenfreude of watching best laid plans go by the wayside keep me coming back for the ride.

Vlaada is the most diversely talented designer alive and it is not even remotely close.  Most designers you play one of their games and you can sense who designed it.  Rosenburg or Wallace or Dorn or Gerts, you just know as the rules are getting explained.  The only reason you know a game is designed by Vlaada is because it seems so insanely unique that you think that drugs have to be in some way involved.

Galaxy Trucker is no exception, I love putting the ships together, if you just put the game away after that I'd still give it an 8, it's just very amusing.

The mission piece if pretty forgettable, but it's a game to experience, if only for it's complete uniqueness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fantastic. This game is very different than any other game I can think of. At its heart, the game is about building ships from a jumble of parts as efficiently as possible and then testing how well you did by throwing ever possible hazard you can at it. It is definitely at its best when played with others at the same experience level.

Only ever played with Another Big Expansion and I can completely understand why people suggest it needs expansions to shine - the base game would certainly feel a little thin.

Believe the hype. This is a gripping fun filled experience. Always a smash hit when brought to the table, for new players and old alike. Quite a bit of randomnes, but you won't care much.

After 5 plays I can't really speak for replayability, but will update. Personally, I will probably soon feel the urge to spice it up with some expansions. 

The rule explanation always generates some eye-brow lifting, but as soon as you get going it always prove to be intuitive to most. Wouldnt spring it on complete non-gamers, however.

People with very poor spacial and/or design sense should keep away.

Galaxy Trucker is fantastic. The tile building followed by simulated destruction is fun, challenging, and satisfying. However, the random chance can leave a single player completely destroyed right out of the gate, so the rage quit factor can be a bit high. Also, the mechanic which allows the player to peek ahead at the upcoming events seems unnecessary.

This is one of those games that I like despite being horrible at it.  I am not good at real time spaceship construction, which I feel is the heart of the game, and the most enjoyable part.

Plenty of games are mean to you. They'll make it tough to get money, they'll make it easy to get your troops killed. They'll throw Rats at you at the worst possible time. But Galaxy Trucker has a special sadism that not only destroys your belongings, but it takes that which you worked on, stressed over, and built with your very hands and crumbles it chunk by chunk by pummeling it with meteors, cannon fire, and the occasional sabotage. The cards have a special way of finding that one open connector and tossing a small meteor in there, destroying the unfortunate component that happened to be holding on three cannons on one side and your sole engine and 12 credits' worth of goods on the other. You learn from your mistakes, and this next time you'll make sure you don't have such vulnerable components like that. Then the Robosmokeys take out your battery component while Explosive Batteries is out, and you lose eight other central components, leaving you with a sorry third of a ship. As good as you can get at the game, there will always be that card specifically designed to make your labor blow into bits right before your eyes.

And you know what? That's awesome.

Galaxy Trucker keeps bringing me back. Whether it's the challenge of building the perfect ship next time, or the joy of seeing tons of explosions, or the intense time pressure of the building phase, this game delivers. And if you're lucky, so do you. For now there's no way I can turn down a game of this. Lots of fast action, lots of just all-around fun. The expansion gets almost necessary for appropriate toughness after several plays.

A finely honed frustration machine... but not in a good way, as is clearly intended. Not only did a bad start or a spot of bad luck mean that I wasn't in the running to win, but basically I couldn't even participate in the game. Not eager to give it another chance.

I was blown away by how fun this game was the first time I played it.  Building the ship is pure and frantic fun.  It feels like a fast-paced puzzle with a lot of interesting decisions that players need to make quickly.  Seeing how the ships fare against meteors, enemy ships, and combat zones is entertaining and very random.  This isn't a game you can take too seriously, there is strategy involved but at the end of the day, if you get an unfortunate series of cards and dice rolls, your ship could end up in bad shape.  There are ways players can prepare for the hazards though (looking at the cards during building and choosing tiles accordingly), but this takes practice to do quickly.  Because of this, players that have played the game more times will usually build much better ships and do very well because of that.  Overall, I love this game, but it certainly isn't for everyone.

I'm not really the first one in line to play space themed games, so I was a little reluctant when this was the chosen game for a board game night. 

Happy to report though that I changed my mind very fast -- I had a great time building my truck, tearing through space, and managed to still be very entertained even though I soon lost my crew to invading aliens and my ship to passing asteroids. 

Fun theme, more fun to play-- and here's where I show my two thumbs up-- even fun to lose! Enough said.

Good fun and manic first half......enjoyed by most

Great silly fun .....half my space ship wandered ooff on its own..make the race fast and furious ..for more fun roll your own dice for attacks on your ship ..so unfair !!

Try the second 3rd class alt ship .....ouchie 

Lots of expansions..my wife ship always looks so pretty...good for ADHD people :)

RATING: 6
A fun game if you don't take it too seriously.  The best built ship can get pummeled into pieces while a poorly designed ship can get lucky and escape all the meteors and other nasty card events.  

I can see this game getting boring if played too often.  The game itself is simple - build a ship as quickly as you can then watch the event cards tear your ship apart.  Not enough variety to get this on my table continuously.

A unique game mechanically. However, the second phase of each round mostly plays itself. It can be fun to watch your friend's spaceships explode, but it sucks when yours barely makes it out of the gate and you are forced to simply watch others fly for the next 10-20 minutes. The game rounds are also poorly balanced. The third round matters much more than the first two.

RATING: 7
How frustrating! Hopefully pulling the right tiles to build a useful ship, you always forget some necessity (not enough batteries or red cargo holds or forward blasters or engines!) Then, one blast knocks out half your ship because of how you connected things, which you have very little control over in the timed build.  I thought I was going to like this one but repeated plays have netted little improvement.  I don't want a game that needs excessive practice time prior to playing. I'll play it if someone twists my arm, but won't force the issue.

RATING: 6
Terrific fun of smashing up a cobbled-together creation you barely had time to think about as you constructed it.

The absurdity of strapping battery packs (with their appropriately whimsical artwork) and shields and connections into a ship, and then trying to fend of pirates and cart space goods from point A to point B makes for a very entertaining concept.

Desperately needs a cooperative 'convoy' mode - perhaps that's in one of the many expansions, though I've not seen it if so.  Unfortunately able to be badly imbalanced by a more skilled builder being able to just out-construct the other players.  With an odd number of players, the proposed team variant can't help - not that it really solves the problem anyway.

Still, zany fun for all kinds of groups.

The only game I hate worse than this is Fluxx.  I dislike puzzle games but not as much as I loathe real time tabletop games, so this one really never had a chance.  To be fair, I can see why someone who likes the above genres might rate this higher, but not higher than maybe a 7.  Putting together a puzzle like space ship under the pressure of an hour glass timer is only half the battle.  The turn based portion of the game involves flipping cards that include a variety of potentially devastating elements, including meteor swarms, getting blasted by aliens, or ripped off by space pirates.  The mayhem is often fueled by random dice rolls that can make even a well planned and put together ship a pile of junk.

This got all the things (IMO) a good game should have. It's fun. The theme is interesting. It's quite fast to play. There's humour in it. You have to use your head while playing. Cards keep the game different. A bit of luck is involved. Downtime is equal to zero. Even tough there isn't much interaction i must say that Galaxy Trucker is a very nice game.

Very original game, and really a breath of fresh air among the many games I have in my collection. Takes more time to play than I imagined however. Also, it is not for everyone: In our group, some had considerably more "puzzle talent" than others, resulting in less competition during the race. Still, I am very much looking forward to my next play and hope I can keep my ship from falling apart once again! Great with two, as long as there is no big difference in skill. Nice components, especially the little spacemen!

A unique theme and excellent game play. There is a dexterity element to the game as players scramble to build their spaceship by putting together the components of the ship from a general pool of tiles. Hence, a quick eye and good spatial recognition is crucial to building a good craft. I find this mad scramble for tiles quite unique and fun. The second part of the game feels a little like In the Year of the Dragon where more bad things than good things happen to your spaceship. Whomever can weather the space hazards best will win. This game is actually quite fun with two players as well, although with more players, I can imagine the frenetic pace of ship building. I like this game because its a breath of fresh air, both in theme and in mechanic. Kudos Vlaada!

This is a lot of fun if you don't mind luck. This is extremely luck based. Some call it a game for masochists. 

Personally, I'm a bit so-so on the expansions. They make the game far too difficult. However, they are modular expansions, so if a 5th player or extra tiles or the extra alien is all you're looking for, go for it.

This is currently in my top 5 games of all time and I don't expect that to change anytime soon.

I like Galaxy Trucker, but I really wish I liked it more. Unfortunately the initial fun of frantically assembling your scrap-heap ship is rather overshadowed by the much longer, almost meaningless, stage where you actually fly it. 
I realize that the flights are there to test your design, but surely that implies that the game is actually about construction? Why not stretch this phase out? Add mechanisms for screwing with your opponents ships? Develop the tile laying game play? Oh well.

The rulebook makes this game for me.

It makes me feel like I'm in Douglas Adams' world, and who wouldn't want to be there?

I sometimes feel like building my ship is the game, as the cards just sort of do what they like.

There aren't many choices to make during the actual game part of the game, but it's so fun that you don't really care. Or rather, I don't.

Manages to be both a wacky 'experience' game and a strategic planning game, depending on how you want to play it.

I'm absolutely in the camp of players who thoroughly enjoys the building part of the game, but not the resolution part (resolution of the race has -less- interesting decisions and takes -longer- than the building... not a good combination).

I'm tempted to make fan expansion to fix the problem.

And now I'm probably going to like it more because we found that the same die roll affects all the players instead of each rolling.

This is an expensive, challenging game, and you should have both extensions (the anniversary edition includes them). You have two phases. First, you built a spaceship. All the players grab parts on tiles one by one and place them, and you need to have some of several different kinds of parts and organized in the right way. Takes a lot of thinking, and under time pressure. The first one to finish their ship gets a bonus. Then you test the ships, flying them amidst meteor storms, space pirates, and so forth. This is an intense game, so I have to be alert and in the mood to play. It's a long game, well over an hour, with 3 rounds, but if you wish, you can play the game with just one round or two. Great for exercising lots of cognitive skills
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Some might might say that I am giving Galaxy Trucker a low rating simply bcause it is precisely the sort of spatial relationship game that I find close to impossible. From Alhambra to Vegas Showdown, my brain just doesn't process spatial relationships in the ways these games demand. But, despite my inability to play competitively, I still find many of these spatial games enjoyable: I love Factory Fun and Ubongo! So my complaints against Galaxy Trucker are honestly unrelated to the fact that not one of my spaceships made it to the end of the round (ugggg.) And, actually, I really enjoyed the 'building my ship' phase of the game. If Galaxy Trucker were all about building a SpaceCraft and then either: (a) letting a computer run the event deck against it letting everyone know in seconds how it all turned out or (b) running an event deck that actually had a narrative structure (rather than just random bad things) I'd give it an 8 or maybe even a 9. But I found the resolution phase of the game deeply unsatisfying, even depressingly boring. This second phase, resolving the events against the spaceship the players built, is long and banal, with almost no meaningful decisions made by the players. Many games (notably those called "Ameritrash") are low on decision analysis but high on narrative. And interestingly Galaxy Trucker merges the two types of gaming experience into one game, with the first phase representing analysis and the second representing narrative. But here the narrative isn't very deep or coherent-- rather it is just a bunch of random events one after another. If this phase had the arc of good narrative or the tension of a real story, I think it would be significantly more enjoyable for me. So, as the game stands, I'd eagerly build ships again (fun!) if I can be excused from the tedium of being bombarded with space flotsam. Just wake me up and let me know how it all turned out. (** The bits are beyond great. The game gets an extra half point in my rating just for how gorgeous it is.)

I thought this was fun.  In each of the three rounds of this game there's a 'speed' phase, in which you build a spaceship from a common pile of components, then an event card phase that test the building decisions you take.  There is some tactics and opportunity for risk-taking in the second phase, but the enjoyable part is the construction puzzle.  It's a novelty game I don't pull out often - but I own too many conventional ones for which the same can be said.

Absolutely love it! Great, silly fun when play with a good group of people.  Not a game you pick to flex your brain, or even with an aim to win.  It's just light-hearted, fast-paced fun.

I don't think I'll ever bore with building ships, it really taps into my lego-building childhood.  The race against time and your opponents makes it exhilarating.  The second half of the game, where you fly through the event cards. That's where I fall off a bit.  It can be a lot of fun sometimes if you're jockeying for position, there are some tactical decisions you have to make towards conserving resources and position, but it can feel like it drags a bit after the dozenth meteor roll.

After initial plays, the game has lost some of it's lustre.  I'm overjoyed to have it in my collection, but sometimes it falls flat with new players, there's a huge gab between experience level that it's not fun for the old hat playing it against newbies.  I still always crave a more engaging experience for the second half of the game.

Pretty fun game. Not for every group since you need to be a good sport about your ship likely being blown to bits. My wife and I have got many plays with just the two of us.
My beef with Galaxy Trucker is that there's really not much to it after you build your ship. The game play seems weak, decisions are small, and strategy low. I guess just know that this game is ALL ABOUT BUILDING YOUR SHIP and then crossing your fingers. But it does that very well.

RATING: 7
Innovative and fun twist on real-time gaming.  There's enough difficulty in building your ship and unpredictability that you're constantly trying to balance what you need to plan to keep your ship from falling apart versus what you need to make sure that you can store enough goods.  And, of course, don't let yourself finish too slowly...  You won't be able to get enough goods if that happens.  And make sure you are aggressive about pushing the timer, because you can't let the other players have too much time overengineering their ship.  This isn't a deep strategy game, but it's a wild ride that's great for groups looking to unwind.  

Once players get good at this game, the ship-building will become much more cutthroat, as there are some components which are much better than others.  If you're going to play vets vs. newbies, I would suggest some kind of handicapping mechanism, or else the vets will win every time, even more so than in most games.

RATING: 10
This one is a ten.  It's that good.  Why?

1.  You get to build something.  Few games give me such a real sense of building as this one does.

2.  The thing you built?  It's gotta work.  You get to fly it through space and see how it actually performs.

There's a catch-up mechanism built into this game, as well as the very real possibility of failing totally.  I love it.

Galaxy Trucker gives me a primal sense of accomplishment or the hilarity of watching something I built, probably very poorly, smashed to pieces.  It's got the fun/strategy/interest combo just right and it's also totally unique.

RATING: 7
(after 1 3p game and 1 4p game)  Little skeptical going in since I disliked my play of Factory Fun and had heard some comparisons.  Difference in GT is that you can grab a tile and place it (or leave it face up as a discard), there is not a race for one of the 3 or 4 tiles each round.  Interesting cards through the 3 rounds.  This is not a brain burning perfeect information German game, but it is a lot of fun to see your ship tackle the event cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.25
After finishing a few plays of this game, I still feel like the timed shipbuilding plays quite well into the theme of trying to build the best, yet unavoidably imperfect, ship with the materials that you have. And the scoring can be humorous as you watch your ship fall apart. However, the core concept of the game (i.e., decision optimization based on quick spatial reasoning) is far from my strong suit, so I don't think I would necessarily prioritize this game over some of the others in our collection.

First play - 4 players. Great game. We were all new to the game although two of us had read the rules already.
The game is fantastic. We were very lenient with the ship building rules at first but that would change once we all knew what was going on. As much fun as building the ship was the adventure cards are what really does it for me. Coming across a meteor shower or a group of pirates while tranporting your goods is exciting. When your ship finally comes to port and you're torn to pieces but you still manage to scrape up a few bucks and relive the experience of the journey with the other captains is a lot of fun.

For what it is, an excellent game. I think for people who like this type of game, Galaxy Trucker hits a home run. The event phase can be pretty boring though, just waiting to get through the cards, rolling dice over and over to see if you got hit by an asteroid. Oddly, I felt unengaged during the building phase as well, and on the whole just wanted the game to end. It's possible however that with more experienced players at the table (and without a long rules explanation prior to commencing) the pace would be quick enough that I'd find myself more engaged. Thus the rating could definitely go up from here with repeated plays, which I do hope to get in sometime.

- Not fun when some players are experienced others are not.
- With experience the game becomes pretty easy.

RATING: 5
This is one of those games that I want to like -- and did like when I first played it, in fact -- but I went one whole year without playing the game, and honestly didn't miss it too much.  I still enjoy the ship-building portion of the game, but I get a little annoyed with the way the journey portion plays out.

I don't like that people who take great care to build an efficient, well-constructed ship are more likely to lose the game.  To wit, if you take a lot of time constructing your ship, then you'll wind up in the last position on the movement board, which means you likely won't get the opportunity to take the rewards from beating the slavers, finding an abandoned ship, etc.  It doesn't seem right that a player should be penalized for being careful.

I think Vlaada took a lot of care to set a balance to this game, but I don't know that it's enough for me to really REALLY enjoy it.  I'll give it a few more plays with the expansion to see if that might help alleviate my concerns, but I'm still not overly eager to play any time soon.

So very good.  Nice speed element at the start of the game and then FUN watching how the resolution unfolds.  Most of your choices have been made making the ship but you still have a few and its great to see you're not the only one who makes mistakes while building your ship.  Will be getting the Big box version when available.  A must own for every collection

I love this game.  It's so chaotic and hilarious every time it hits the table in my group.  

Be forewarned, however:  Do not play this with people that can't stand failure.  There is a whole bag of failure in this game for everybody, and they will get upset fairly easily.  Also, disparity in skill level will be apparent in ship-building.  Be diligent about turning the timer over to not give experienced players too much time to complete their ships.

Don't play this game if you easily get stressed. Trying to build the perfect spaceship as quickly as possible while watching the sand running through the timer can be very stressful. Afterwards, taking your spaceship on its maiden voyage, can almost be a tearful experience, as it is blown to smithereens by asteroids, space pirates and what else space deicide to hurl your way. To sum up: this is an excellent game!

I've only ever given two games a 10/10 here, and this is one of them. It's just ridiculous fun. The conceit is simple - build a ship in realtime, way faster than you should, then watch it get destroyed by a mix of how poorly you designed it and how poorly you reacted to all of those meteor storms.

It provides an adult version of "building a cool fun thing and knocking it over", which I never really did as a kid, but I'm sure as hell enjoying it now.

There's just enough meaty euro here to appease people I know who are obsessively into that, too. I mean, not a huge amount, but enough. Because the biggest way to earn points is actually some really clever resource management.

I'm never gonna turn down a game of this, no matter the situation, which is what a game needs to be to get a 10. This undoubtedly deserves it.

I liked it on initial plays, but the game is a bit too easily solved for my taste. After you figure out what a good ship looks like, it's mainly about who can cobble the same recipe together in the shortest amount of time. Which is... whatever?

The expansion helps to increase the decision space, but ultimately I don't really enjoy the timed mechanic all that much.

RATING: 7
Galaxy Trucker is a brilliant design, but a fragile one. The game is meant to be played frantically, with the players trying to rush each other's attempts to build a spaceship and force them into an unprepared launch. It is ridiculously fun with the right group of people that are playing it as intended. If the group as a whole is too careful, the game can become a little tedious. Ninety percent of the joy in playing Galaxy Trucker comes from watching other people's spacehips fail, so it's important to note that if things are built too efficiently that simply won't happen. There's not enough "strategic" gameplay to keep things interesting if everyone decides to play deliberately, so don't let them. Play fast, watch everyone blow-up, have a laugh and move on to the next game. If you play Galaxy Trucker with that attitude, it will be one of the highlights of your game night!

Looking at the mechanics of this game, it semes like something I wouldn't enjoy, but I find it to be a lot of fun. My first play, I found the timer to be very stressful and didn't enjoy my ship being pulverized, but after that I decided to put my perfectionist nature aside for this game, and I found it to be a really enjoyable experience. It almost has a party game atmosphere to it, but with the mechanics of a fun Ameritra-um-Thematic Game. Bonus points for having one of the best rulebooks I've ever read; I literally laughed out loud at several points. Kudos to whoever translated it for preserving the humor.

Pretty clever.  Involved in areas that don't seem to add much value to the experience, but I like the variability and the frenetic building grab.  The flight is nice, too, though obviously you can see some wild runs.  I find the graphics a bit fuzzy; it's harder to see a spaceship forming than it is to see a pipe-laying game with a veneer.

Bottom line, though: great, original game.

This is my current favorite game, even after playing 15+ times in the last few months.

The game is wildly funny, from the manual, to the destruction of the ships.
It is a fully self contained game that is accessible and challenging.

Big fans can also get "The Big Expansion", and actually get to play it, because it can be used only on the expert players, sparing the new players from severe complication.
The idea of an expansion that levels the playing field and adds no complication to the new players at all is just brilliant.  

Just don't expect to get through 3 rounds in 60 min unless everyone is very experienced.

A wonderfully fun game, so fresh and hilarious! i had a lot of fun despite my abysmally bad ships that fell to pieces... probably just because they were falling apart uner meteors strucking from all over. 
The explanations and all the details unfortuntaley take a bit too long so i can't play it with anyone, but after a short time everything feels natural and fun!
Nice components too.
The mechanic is very nice and interesting and even if it seems strange, u can actually use different strategies to win, it is not just a game of luck. 
great!

Building the ships during the first phase of the game is a blast. It's definitely interesting to see what configurations everyone winds up having. Playing out the rest of the round by flipping and resolving all the cards is a touch on the tedious side, but that may improve with further practice.

RATING: 7
Much like factory fun there's a quick decision making aspect where you're trying to figure things out before your opponents do.  What makes Galaxy Trucker different though is after you build your ship you use it to earn victory points, whereas in Factory Fun the whole game is building the factory, so I like the idea of using what you build which makes the ship construction all the more cruical.

Voor al je chaotische puzzelplezier.

Iedere speler bouwt tegelijk aan een ruimteschip dat na afloop een ruimtereis moet overleven die is bezaait met meteorieten en ruimtepiraten. Voor zijn/haar schip kan men kiezen uit allerlei onderdelen, zoals wapens, voortstuwingsraketten, schilden en extra cockpitruimte.

Diegene die de meeste punten aan zijn/haar ruimtereis overhoudt wint.

Interesting but in the regular speed building it feels likes their is a noticeable learning curve that give experienced players too great an edge. Making it hard for new players to join games without handicap cards for the veterans. Wish their was a quick dice version of this (ships would be dice parts).  I am not a fan of real time speed games but this is another unique concept from Vlaada Chvátil.

Definitely a game for people who enjoy puzzles and spatial relationships and who don't mind a lot of chaos in their games.  I don't want all my games to be like Galaxy Trucker, but this is a nice break and makes for good variety.  I love building the ship even though I know it won't be perfect.  The random events are fine by me - if they were too controlled the game would lose it's fun, and part of the fun is watching your ship get blown apart or just barely make it through.  One round you might get blown to smithereens, but there's always the next round where you might skate by with barely a scratch. Luck, yes, random, yes, fun definitely.  

Control freaks should not play this game.

My first game we enjoyed it a lot. Played all the boards with the timer option including a training 1st round. Need more experience as I am a crap ship builder!!
When things get too easy I hope to add rough road ahead expansion tiles.

RATING: 8
I am very mixed about this. I do enjoy the real-time grab fest when building your ship but I have to lay aside the competitive part of me somewhat because once you can comfortably build a reasonable ship, it really is mostly luck based.
It is still a blast though.
EDIT:
Once you get better you can mitigate the luck by peeking at what is to come. This game is growing on me and my rating has increased from 7 to 7.7
EDIT2:
Still creeping up and now an 8/10. This game is a lot of fun and I can see it possibly going higher.

The mechanics are totally different from RoboRally, but there are some similarities:  1) it's a race; 2) it gets chaotic; 3) it's a light-weight game that rewards strategy, but also has randomness; 4) it's funny when someone else gets devastated (as long as it's not you); and 5) it's really fun to play.

Speed game. You build your ship from a pile of tiles that everyone is using. When time runs out you are finished. Next you find out what bad connections you made. Then you fly into all the bad things in space. If you built the right kind of ship you succeed, if not... I lost half of my ship in 2 successive turns. I do think the game works well for those that like speed games.

Played once (with 3 players). A strange game, which definitely was an interesting and fun experience - but not one I would actively look for again. The spaceship building rules are nice, but the travel part is awfully random and possibly unfair. Ok - it may be fun to see everyone's ship blasted to pieces by nasty asteroids, but I don't really see the point, which leaves me with a very doubtful overall feeling.

Yes, this is it the lowest region a boardgame can be.
Well in my opinion, you *might* think it's great, and in that case: do enjoy.

Anyway, I truely hope I never have to undergo this again.
First part, grab space parts and chuck them on the board.

*yaay* that felt totally irritating, pointless and the biggest reason to mount blades on your fingers.

Part 2 : auto-pilot...

Yeah, shit going to happen, destroying the thing you've just build. Well unless you are a genius of cardboard space ship building.  

The only good thing here (for me) is how the Game Designer got idea's to re-implement things in Space Alert, which above my expectations, I do like.

Fun fun fun! The two part game involves an hilarious scramble to build your ship, then fly it through the crazy galaxy. The two things that keep this out of my very tip-top of my list are:

This game has ups and downs...

Building your ship against time is really fun and watching everyone's ships being destroyed is even funnier.

The rest of the game is just random events that randomly makes one of the players the winner. You don't have much control of your success so this game is only made for having fun with friends. Not competitive at all.

I played this early in my board gaming "career" and absolutely hated it - it was too long and too random. After picking up the iOS app based on rave reviews and playing the heck out of it, my rating needs to be revised up. This is one that I think is better in the digital form. In board game form, it still wouldn't be my first choice, but I probably wouldn't turn down a game anymore.

A lot of fun with 3 or 4 players. Unfortunately it doesn't work with 2. After you have some experience with building ships, there's almost no challenge as there's enough parts to build ships from. Can be fixed with house rules e.g. not using all the tiles

I absolutely love this game. The components and the concept are simply outstanding. However, it hasn't gone well with anyone besides hardcore gamers. The learning curve is quite steep, especially when building ships. If you can get a group to commit (and maybe watch a YouTube video or play the app first), you'll be in for an incredible experience. Both phases of the game--shipbuilding and the flight itself--are thoroughly enjoyable.

This game is played for the shear enjoyment.  Building the ship is a fantastic mind puzzle and the more the merrier when it comes to ships blowing up!  The scoring flights can be a bit long... but its nice to see your ship do something once you've built it!

Fun and silly.  Surprisingly Galaxy Trucker was quite a chore to learn in the beginning, but after getting pass the initial rules hump, there were quite a bit to like about this game.  Although it was encouraged to build a well rounded ship suitable for any encounters, this task became almost impossible with the timed and competitive nature of the construction phase.  For me, half of the fun was to see people's ship getting blown to bits little by little.  However, I was concerned at the replayability of Galaxy Trucker, because after just 3 rounds, I found myself slightly bored of seeing the same cards being flipped over (honestly, pirates was the only one I hoped for by then).  One other thing I didn't like was how the lead ship tended to end up as the cannon fodder.  Once it is damaged and have no proper resources to complete most of the encounters, it will then continue to stay ahead (while the others fall behind because they are delayed by exploring abandoned station, picking up cargoes, etc) and continue to be the first (and sometimes the only one) to get pounded at.  Either we missed a rule somewhere, or that just seemed completely unfair and broken.  Anyway, not a bad game to play once in a while, but it wouldn't be something I'd ask for often.

A very frustrating game for me. I don't like time pressure in these types of games, and Galaxy Trucker is one of the worst in this department. First is all time pressure, next is a lot of luck. There is definitely strategy, but I can't seem to grasp it. Try as I might, I can't bring myself to enjoy this game, despite its awesome theme.
I also find Chvatil's games to be a slapdash amalgamation of bizarre mechanics smushed together, and this one is no exception. It feels like 2 separate games were fused together into one which is less than the sum of its parts.

Original juego en cuanto a temÃƒÂ¡tica y sobre todo mecÃƒÂ¡nicas. Buenos componentes y muy entretenido para jugar con cualquiera. El problema, la gran descompensaciÃ³n entre jugadores expertos y no expertos.

This games simple rocks. I love it. I hate it. I am awesome at it. I am terrible at it. That pretty much sums up Galaxy Trucker. I have never had so many different emotions while playing a game. It's just plain simple fun. I also recently got my non gamer brother and his wife to play this and they LOVED it. Never thought of it as an "entry" level game and probably won't recommend it as such but it worked great for them. They were blown away by how unique this game is. WARNING: This game is not to be taken serious. If you take it serious it will NOT be fun. Your ship WILL blow up at some point on some play through. You will LOSE parts of it. You will probably lose a lot of it. Smile and keep on trucking!

After one play, I think this game is brilliant.  Clever and unique; I had a lot of fun.

I suspect my rating will drop a little bit after a couple of more cutthroat games; I just want my ship to be complete and well-designed too badly, and I know I'm going to get frustrated against experienced/quick-thinking players.

Update: Still a 9.  This game is brilliant, clever, unique, and a lot of fun.

Update: Okay, dropping a little bit for fiddliness and randomness.

Carc meets Blink in space. I've had some negative feedback on this game and I understand why. Most games involve building a strategy and a position. Not here at all - this is a descent into chaotic destruction where losing horrendously is often more entertaining than winning. Delicious chaos.

Excellent shortish game all about frantic spaceship building in a race against your opponents.  Timed games are always good (see Space Hulk & Robo Rally).

Warning, may result in frustration.  Prepare to lose your first couple of games badly.

After 1 Play: I loved my first play of this!  I really hope it gets an American publisher, as the import price is a little steep.  However, if it doesn't, this is one of the few games that I'd definitely pay the high price for.

After 10+ Plays: I'm still a big fan of this.  It's more skill than strategy, but that's just fine with me as strategy doesn't often mix well with chaotic destruction.

Vlaada is a genius. You build a space ship out of tiles that you try to fit together, and not turn by turn, but everyone grabs tiles at the same time, and everything is on a timer. When all are done, you draw cards to see what kind of dangers you'll encounter, and you hope for the ship to hold together. Absolutely amazing. Played countless times.

Build your own spaceship and see it blasted to pieces while you race it against other players spaceships. 
The fun part is the building of your ship. It's connecting the right pieces while everyone is on a timer.Have a laugh at other players dreadfull creations.
Building the ships takes some skill but can be stressfull (in a pleasant way). The second part tests your ship by throwing problems at it. It has some luck, but the best ship has a good chance of scoring the best.

It took some plays before the game clicked. But it's certainly amusing, fun and a fresh concept.

RATING: 7
Hilarious when misfortune carries large pieces of the ships away, although that tends to happen less over time. The simultaneous scrambling for pieces part of the game makes it prone to needing the right kind of frantic energy in order to work up the desire to play the game, but it's fast enough and well enough designed,

The sequel to this game should be called "Galaxy Truck Stop Whores".  It should also have LARP elements.

A very fun game. It's a bit random and the timer and spatial element seem to frustrate those who aren't good at theme. The theme is very well executed and the pieces are great though.

Build a spaceship out of junk and attempt to fly it across the galaxy in one piece while avoiding meteor storms, slavers and war zones. Simply brilliant game that requires a sense of humour and ability to laugh at your own misfortune.

The ideal mix and strategic and silly. Admittedly, it gets a little less fun when you get good and your ships don't fall apart at all. But by then expansions were bought, which allow you to scale up the difficulty with rough roads cards and alien invaders.

银河卡车是少有的另类桌游创作，玩家需要在一定时间内拼装自己的飞船，然后经历宇宙空间各种事件的考验，到达终点卖出货物赚到宇宙币。规则上简单容易上手，玩家的观察，反应，策略三者需面面俱到，再加上一点点运气才能获得胜利。当然，游戏中还一部分乐趣来自于幸灾惹祸，看着竞争对手支离破碎的船体想必也是一件无比美妙的事情。

Very much a game where you're looking for a lot of laughs. I wouldn't play this when I'm in a strategic thinker mode, but in terms of just having a good time without thinking too hard, this tops my "party game" list.

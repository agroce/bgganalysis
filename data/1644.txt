Really a lot of fun.  The bits are great in the edition I have Tipp-kick Stadion.  Play is very fun and much more strategic than you might think.  Play is quick and you can really put a lot of touch on the ball for special shots.
Highly Recommended!

Reviewing the "Top Set".  Fun dexterity game with very nice and durable components.  The English rules that come with the game are a bit fuzzy in terms of defending, but you get the drift.  Quite a bit of skill in this one, trying to keep possession of the ball!

Great time with this at BGG.con.  Like to find a copy.  Nice bits (metal players!)

UPDATE! (Sept. 2010)  Found one at Tuesday Morning for only $4.99!  Score!

If you all like dexterity games at all, you need to check this out. At only $4.99 new in shrink it's a steal.  Even at the $15 retail it would be a good value. I was ready to blow dozens of pounds on one of these a year or so ago. The players are HEAVY, solid metal, and both players and goalies have very clever mechanisms for kicking and blocking. You also get goals, and a very nicely made pitch, and two balls. The balls are unusual, and multifaceted like a gem, so you can get some interesting curves on kicks. I think anyone could enjoy this whether a soccer fan or not (I'm not).

Very fun dexterity soccer game that's a lot cheaper than a good foosball table and comparable in price to Subbuteo.  It also takes up a lot less room than either of those games, too!  The game plays quickly, packs lots of action into a short time and is easy for younger children to learn to play.

Oh my god! I can't believe I found Tipp-Kick on this site. BGG rules! This was one of my all time favourite as a wee tyke. My bro and I spent countless hours playing this. Being huge footie fans we couldn't get enough of this game. It also had truly cool bits. The players were made of sturdy metal. In fact I still have one of them kicking around 30 years later!!!

(update)30 years later, I found a new copy of Tipp-Kick Stadio edition at a liquidation sale. Thie version has a felt pitch nicely mounted with sideboards. The goalie has a new move. It stills dives from side to side, but it can now pounce forward to get the ball. The players are the same. No real change there. The gameplay remains the same! 30 years later Tipp-Kick still rocks!

Some friends of my parrents had this, back when I was a kid, and my sister and I used to love playing with it. I found a set as an adult, bought it, but didn´t find it as interesting as way back when...
So this has been donated to the club where I work, and the kids love it! Primarily football/soccer playing boys at the age of 11 to 14.

A fairly fun dexterity game. Each player controls one footballer and one goalie. Things can get pretty frantic since the turn is random (depending on the color on the ball), and its good fun, but I don't think it has long term replay value for me.

I have never been a huge soccer fan, even though I was an active player in my childhood and youth. Tipp-Kick was pretty interesting when I got it and I realize this game has a cult following, but I got bored of it quickly.
After trying it again in 2017, we felt this game just wasn't for us as it seemed too random and we clearly didn't have the skills to do any decent shots on the goal that were hard to parry for the goalkeepers.

RATING: 9.5
The game I played the most in my life, played it literally for several hundred hours, even hole Bundesliga seasons with all 306 matches plus the cup... 

Basically, you hit your player on the head to shoot a ball that is half white and half black. The colour on top decides who is allowed to shoot next.

Sounds a little boring, but when you played it often enough, you get a feeling for your players and can handle them like instuments, it's becoming some kind of art then and every player develops his own style. It's not planning anymore then, it's intuition. 

Still play it once a year with one of my best childhood buddies and it's still great.

What could be better than using little metal figures to kick a little ball up and down a felt playing field?  Tough to be the goalie.  Don't play with my dad: he doesn't wait for the ball to completely stop, or for you to set up defense!

['70s Top-Set] Fun beer & pretzels action game.  You better be in shape because it plays real-time and you'll be running around the table to get the advantage (shooting or placing defenders).  Great components: metal players, smooth pitch, wind-up clock, plastic goals and field enclosure.  I think a tournament may be in order.

This is a simple but fun 3D soccer game that only uses a goalie and one outfield player per side. The players are able to kick or dive to make a save thanks to the use of buttons that are connected to wires, which enable the players to kick/dive.

The ingenious element is the hexagonal ball which is half white and half black. Each side selects 1 of the colours and after the ball is kicked, the colour which is on top of the ball when it stops denotes which side is in possession and gets to kick at goal next. Very clever.

Now having said all that the game is indeed fun. But...is it fun enough to get out and set up every time? I suspect not. If it could be left set up then it would be fun enough to play regularly, but the fun doesn't really warrant the effort of getting it out of the box each time for me.

I now have three sets, including the awesome tournament pitch bought in a second hand toyshop in Germany. Also have a dozen players - and just built a tournament board! Very easy game to play, more accessible for kids and casual gamers than Subbuteo. High scoring, lots of action - all in ten minutes. Pick it up if you're a dexterity or sports fan. Only problem is the common Classic set's pitch is very small.

Vintage 1970s standard version.

The game is deceptively simple. Each side has only 2 players: A goalkeeper and a 'kicker'. The ball is has two sides; black and white. If your colour is the one showing on top, you have posession and can kick the ball.

The quality is phenomenal. The kicker figures are cast metal and even my 70s version is in good shape. The pitch, like subbuteo, tends to warp and not sit flat though.

I love the game.

RATING: 9
OH MAN!  This is really one of the greatest Dexterity games around.  I really feel like I got a work-out playing this.  This gives a wonderful feel of being out on the feel, the "realtime" aspect of the game gets your heart thumping.  The only thing I can compare it to is Light Speed, but this takes that frenetic energy and keeps you going for 20 minutes.

Run your pieces around the board and hope that your next kick doesn't turn the ball over.  Squeak in the shot to score.

GOOOOOOAAAAAALLLLLLLLAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!

1 half-game (had to go eat!)

Relatively simple dexterity game played in real time: my version of the rules are here -- http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/40224 (I needed more details than the included rule set since I know nothing about soccer). Basically, whichever color is face up on the ball (20-sided die?) gets to kick it; defender can't be too close, unless they're helping block goal; if ball goes out, last team not to touch it gets to kick it in. 2 5-min halves, with players trading sides/colors each half. Most pts wins.

Unlike other dexterity games, it's not immediately apparent to me that there is a learnable skill here. At least, not easily learned. I mean, how much control does one really have when kicking that ball? Unless more skill becomes apparent soon, I'm afraid this won't get a lot of play. On the plus side, though, it is quick!

I'm not a dexterity game fan and this one certainly didn't change my mind any.  I've heard this game actually has a decent sized following in some areas where people play huge competitions.  Even as not a dexterity game fan I can still appreciate the appeal in some dexterity games...but not this one.

This game is just boring and monotonous.  Players take turns using one metal player piece to kick an oddly shaped ball across a field trying to get it into the goal of the opponent.  Which color on the ball is facing up after a kick dictates which player gets to go next and this is completely random, you won't be able to convince me even amazing players have any control over this.  Each player also has a goalie they can control.  The goalie can lay down completely and block the bottom half inch of the small net.  It is also difficult to get air on the little plastic ball, especially from any kind of distance and with good accuracy.

All in all, just a boring back and forth experience.  Not for me.

You play only with 1 player (+ goalkeeper). It`s hard to make an action. When the ball is in the middle of the field, its ok. But when it is by the side, it`s hard to shot, because there`s not much space, to put your player on the field.

I want such game, but... basketball ;)

It's real fun, especially when two players are rather experienced, such that it plays truely real-time, more action-packed, and hence far more techniques can be developed. It's usually un-noticed about the passage of time when you are in the field. 10 minutes go so quickly.

Now feeling pity not having bought any spare players (those with different leg-shapes) for different kicking abilities. It's like selecting different clubs in a golf game. 
The clock and score counter looks cool but I didn't buy it neither.

This game, like Tsuro, is really pleasureable as an aesthetic experience, as well as a game.  My 6 y.o. son and I both really like building games.  Creating a product and seeing it take shape is fun enough on its own to take the sting out of losing a game.

It looks like a cross between Blokus and Pueblo, but it doesn't play like either. It's not as negative as Pueblo, where placing a piece is agony; but it's not as strategic as Blokus, where you really feel like you have to protect your flanks and break though the ranks of the opposition. ;)

Yes, it comes with the "Lazy Susan."

A somewhat straight-forward building game, you can teach/learn the rules in about 30 seconds.  A little dry/abstract, but still a good game.  If you like Blokus and/or Pueblo, you'll probably enjoy this one, too.

Especially since it avoids the "negative-only" gameplay of Pueblo.

This is a fun, quick game that suffers a little bit from being just too hard for a casual experience, yet too straightforward for a more complex game.

The challenge is a lot of fun, but the time limit is just too short. In 5 of the 10 rounds of the only time I played, no one got it right. I won by getting it 3 times, in contrast to my opponents, getting it right just 2 times. Perhaps with a few more time to figure it out, it could improve.

This is just a temporary rating after 1 play. I'm looking forward to give it another try.

RATING: 5
This game in its current release has very poor production value.  Many of the pieces are warped and not quality checked.

The game play is striking similar to other "tetris" packing games out there like Pueblo.  I feel that Pueblo is the superior entry in this category.

While the build up idea is cool with different boards and rotaty spinny board, I felt that playing it was too easy to put down other players.  That you can completely eliminate another player during the game is a bad thing in my book.

I will play it if asked, but it doesn't float my boat.

Én Rumis néven ismerem, de ha már Blukos 3D, akkor megemlítem, hogy nekem jobban tetszik, mint a 2D-s eredeti Blokus. Néha 2 lépés után látszik, ki lesz a győztes, máskor végig kérdéses a kimenetel. Két személyeset szeretem benne, mert akkor tisztán logikai játék, és az győz, aki túljátssza a másikat. Több játékosnál már nagyon számít a sorrend, és egy harmadik játékos esetleges hibája is. Jó játék és jó készségfejlesztő.

[i]Posted: 6/3/08, Rated: 7[/i]

[i][gameid=2453][/i] was such a hit with my family (especially my wife) that picking up a copy of [i]Rumis[/i] was almost a "no-brainer" decision.  The puzzle-solving nature of the game appears to be very similar, only now it's in three dimensions!

Unfortunately, that is an unfair comparison.  Yes, the pieces do look the same.  Yes, you are placing them on the same board as your opponents.  However, there is where the similarity ends.  In [i]Rumis,[/i] your goal is to have as many block-faces of your color visible when looking down on the puzzle from above.  Height restrictions prevent you from freely stacking your pieces on top of the others.  Each piece you place has to touch face-to-face with another piece of yours, as opposed to [i][gameid=2453][/i] where your pieces may only touch at the corners.  The playing field is sharply defined by the pattern on the card upon which you choose to play.

These differences result in a game that is much less forgiving than [i][gameid=2453][/i].  It is much easier to "box out" an opponent from being able to reach open spaces on the board.  This added aggravation potential knocks an additional point off of my rating, as an early misstep can result in a doomed position.  On the plus side, games usually don't last very long even when played competently, so it won't be long before a doomed player can start again.  It is also very cool to see 3D shapes like the Pyramid rise from the board!

If you like [i]Tetris[/i]-stlye games, then [i]Rumis[/i] is one which you should consider.  It will feel familiar to start, but you will quickly be disabused of that nostalgia, and then realize that it is a building game in its own right.

My wife got this for me at the same time as Blokus. This one rarely comes out, while Blokus gets a lot of play. But I think that this is because for some reason, I'm much better at this game than Blokus so the games aren't as close. I really enjoy this game, just don't get to play it so much.

RATING: N/A
A fun, fun block stacking game. Make sure the mose of your color blocks are visible from the top once everyone has gotten all of the blocks that they can onto the board, simple as that. However, there are some subtle strategies that emerge after repeated plays. Figure them out for yourself! Also, I think the extra boards downloadable on the Geek are better than the ones included with the base game. NOTE: I have Rumis, not Blokus 3D. I just love how the names on my games change here on BGG sometimes...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Curious how people compare this to [i]Blokus[/i] even though the only thing that the two games have in common, is that if you killed a [i]Rumis[/i] piece, the chalk outline could be filled by a Blokus one. It is much more akin to [i]Pueblo[/i], or what multi player 3D Tetris would look like if pieces would arrive from above and no blocks ever exploded.

I really like Pueblo, probably because it uses a single shape of building brick to great effect. Here the designer has come up with the anti-Pueblo. All 3D bricks that you can make with 2,3, or 4 cubes exist, there is no interim scoring, and you are not trying to hide your pieces from view either, but expose them to a top-down observer instead. Predictably, you are handicapped by placement restrictions. This time you need to touch at least one surface of one of your own pieces that is already on the board, and no overhangs are allowed. It's the type of rules I love. The ones that are so obvious that they take 30 seconds to explain, even to non-gamers. If the game is half-decent than this would be a superb bridging game.

Stacking games are nothing new, but this spatial puzzle stands out from the crowd. It comes with four boards that each offer a different combination of floorspace-[i]shape[/i] and height restrictions, all requiring a different strategy to win. And, remarkably, all very challenging, proving that the designer understood exactly how tight the available space needed to be to make play captivating. The four finely tuned challenges are large and flat (wall), small and high (tower), flat and low on the outside and high in the centre (pyramid), and wide and low on one end whilst small and high on the other (steps). Especially the stepped boards throw up placement problems that are easy to underestimate.

When you play with different player amounts, the height restrictions are changed accordingly. It would have been nice if this information from the rulebook table was shown on the relevant (Murmel) boards instead. It is also the sort of game in which turn order matters. The last player might find it harder to win. At the same time, bad play from one player will disproportionately help or hinder another player. When the playing area is this compressed, and without an abundance of turns to recover in, that does matter greatly. For that reason I probably prefer this as a 2-player game, using 2 colours each. As a 3 player it does work well too.

Like Pueblo, it also benefits from standing on a rotating platform, something that isn't part of the Murmel edition. Being able to inspect all sides of the board is vital, so if you have a stationary board players will spend a lot of getting up to crane their neck across to the other side.

On the upside, what bothers me a bit about Pueblo, is that the constant scoring can spin a certain type of player towards long thinking intervals. Here it is just the end scoring that matters. Somehow, as a consequence, it doesn't suffer from the same lengthy analysis gaps. Its construction progresses at a rapid pace, and that is always welcome. . It is also rumoured that both have been endowed with a theme that befits 3D games about stacking cubes. I hope you care.

This stands side to side with Pueblo, and that's a huge compliment in my book. Since they both tackle a similar mechanic from opposite ends, and do that very well, I really don't have a preference for either. Both are 3D gems in their own right.

Definitely a different kind of blokus game than the normal, but definitely fun and difficult.  It's all about how many pieces are visible from the top so your thinking has to be a little different.  The variety of layouts makes it so you can play different ones with different restrictions so there is no one "solution".

impression:  abstract game with 3D Tetris-like pieces.  Quick, colorful and accessible.  Comments indicate that it is sometimes possible to be blocked out quickly and that the blocks are both not uniform and too slippery for building.

RATING: 5
The impression I get from about 10 games is that the winner is often determined by who gets the luckiest start. IF one player can dominate the first tier of the structure he'll lock down a lot of free points. For that reason, I'm a bit ho-hum about Rumis.

RATING: 7
Fun 3D spacial abstract. It's surprisingly enjoyable and as deep as you feel like making it. There is a bit of "gotta stop that guy from winning" going on but it's fairly mild and as long as players are careful to leave decent options for future moves early in the game, it shouldn't devolve into 2 players squabbling while a 3rd cruises to victory. Big plus is both my kids (ages 9 and 5) can play it. Won't ever be a favorite but it's a solid game and a nice presentation as you build your structure. The turntable is a REALLY nice addition and helps a LOT.

Of the various incarnations of Blokus that I have played I find Blokus 3D the most compelling.  It maintains a tense and cut-throat abstract game with a good scability that other forms of Blokus just don't have.  I think Blokus is actually a purer and 'better' game, but it is really just a 4 player game.  Blokus 3D has some of the excellence of Blokus (curious considering its heritage), but scales for different numbers of players better.  I like it.

RATING: 7
Rumis is not at all like a cross between Blokus and Pueblo as many have claimed, even though all three games share geometric block pieces. In Pueblo all the pieces are the same shape, and in Blokus you have to connect by a corner (never a face) in two dimensions, whereas in Rumis you have to connect by a face (never just an edge or corner) in three dimensions. My wife loves it (she usually beats me), and other than Quintillions (three-dimensional Quintominos), it's the game most like a three-dimensional Tetris that I've seen.

Planning is tricky, and you have to balance saving certain small pieces for the end game (so you'll be able to play them at all) with blocking out space for pieces with larger surface areas (which tend to score higher). I think it's a good multi-player abstract, and in four-player games, the scores are usually fairly close.

An alternative scoring method could be to total the number of squares visible from all five visible directions and subtract the number of cubes in the remaining pieces.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Own Rumis.  I think the idea of this is great.  It works well for 2, 3, or 4 players, unlike regular Blokus which does not work for 3.  And the different base boards add some variety, which is great.  My one complaint is that the structures tend to get unstable as they grow; since a collapse would ruin the game, there is some anxiety about instability, and a frequent need to pause and shore up the structure, which is a distraction.  I would love for a deluxe version of this to be released, with precision cut wooden pieces which would easily stay in place.

This game is FUN. One of very few board games where 3D thinking is a factor and also truly represented on the board.  This game is so simple and seems to be such a part of human nature that it should have been invented centuries ago.  Very clever.

Great modular stacking game with strategy.  Blokus in 3 dimensions is a great way to describe it.  I like it better than Pueblo, mostly because in Pueblo, I never thought we were building a Pueblo.  In this game, you can do that and build many other structures.  Your pieces are varied also, where in Pueblo you are working with the same piece over and over again.  The idea of 3D area control is really well developed in this game.

Fast and surprisingly strategic given that you have perfect knowledge into the pieces the other players have.

Rating may rise with further playings.

Only played two-player so far (about 20 times).  Excellent, fun, quick game with some feeling of tactics and strategy on spacial fronts. I rate it higher (= I want to play it more) because it's so quick.  Recently played it 16 times in a row with a buddy while drinking two bottles of wine and talking about women (a topic I introduced to distract him).  Good times!  At the moment, this is one of my favorite 2-player game. I wonder how it plays with 3-4 people? I'm guessing not as well. But 2 player is great.

This has some similarities to Pueblo, but the mass market availability makes it much more accessible. How does it stand up for gameplay? Surprisingly well.

Its very easy to teach/play. With the multiple boards, its got some replayability. A game also takes only a few minutes. 

I'd be willing to play this one as a quick filler from time to time. Going back to my Pueblo comparison, I think Rumis holds its own. Its a lot better than I would have anticipated.

I already like Blokus well enough, so a 3D version of the game sounded good to me.  In Rumis you also get specific layouts which means it's a bit different from game-to-game.

My main concern is that like Blokus I don't think it works as well with less than the full complement of players.  For example, on the larger boards (like Pyramid) it's too easy to "escape" your opponent and lacks the interaction you need for this to really work.

RATING: 9
If [gameid=2453] is (metaphorically) players trying to daringly and cleverly maneuver around each other in the midst of a whirling dance... then this game is those dancers trying to beat each other senseless while crammed inside a telephone booth.

Can be kind of vicious, but doesn't take very long, so at least it's over quickly. The different boards affect gameplay dramatically - as does the number of players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Components: Rumis edition: Great tactile quality. The boards are pretty, the colors are easy to distinguish, and the pieces stay stacked relatively well. I like the heaviness of the pieces, and their semi-translucency, with their colors seeming to hover just below the surface.

Experience: I enjoy the puzzle aspect. It plays like a reverse-Pueblo, and is more enjoyable, because I'm working toward something positive, rather than trying to avoid something negative. There are opportunities for defensive play, and for closely monitoring my opponent's reserve, to capture areas of the board or force particular moves. The different boards lend themselves to different types of games.

I never enjoyed this as much as I thought I would. I believe it's mainly due to the completely non-intuitive scoring at the end of the game. Even though you're building upwards in the game, you're scored based on how much of your color can be seen when looking down directly at the board. It's a mechanic that feels like it belongs in another game, not this one.

A 3D block placement spacial game where players take turns placing oddly shaped blocks onto a lazy susan board. There some restrictions on where one can place the piece, such as inside a perimeter and not higher than a given height (differs based on the model board). The players score points at the end for each square of their own color that is viewable from above the structure. Each leftover piece that a player could not place (due to restrictions and other players blocking) counts -1 point. 

Great, 10 minute game to play with a family or as a filler.

This game is a lot like Pueblo when boiled down to its essentials. Unfortunately, it means I have a very similar reaction to it.  I find the game very stressful, and not in a good way.  Especially with four players, there is so much time for your piece to get buried between your turns.  It's not a heavy game, but I feel the angst of a heavy game when I play it.  It's just not that enjoyable for me.

My Review: [thread=674077]A Year With Blokus 3D[/thread]

Traded with RoboRally, Urban Sprawl, Zombicide Survivor: Kyoko and Zombicide Survivor: Thiago for FITS, If Wishes Were Fishes! and Mutant Meeples
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Players alternate placing different shaped blocks onto a game board.  The game board is a plan of some sort of Aztec structure, indicating the shape and how high it can be.  The object of the game is to get as many of your pieces into the structure as possible, as well as having your colour being viewed when the completed structure is analyzed "top down".  Very easy to teach, 15 minutes to play.  Feels like Pueblo, but cleaner, quicker, and probably better.

Sort of a 3D Tetris game, with the Blokus system of connectivity added to it.  Seems like there is a little less blocking other players in this version.  The various starting borders give it some twists and replayability, but it's one of those games that is very redundant after only a few plays.

Blokus in 3-D. Are you good at spatial orientation games?  You'll be good at this one.  If you have to stand up and face different direction planning out your moves in RoboRally, maybe these games aren't for you.

UPDATE: Before laughing at the fact that my first comment is seemingly a stale joke that incorporates the name of the game, I'll have you know that MY copy has the name Rumis on the box. So THERE.

Initially, I thought that this only worked well with 2, but after a few more plays I've become convinced of my error. This is definitely fun with 2, 3, or 4. I don't know about the idea of adding more with Rumis-plus, but those numbers work well for me. They each have a different feel, but I enjoy all of them.

When playing 2 player, I always play with each player playing two colors.

This version is called "Rumis" (Rebrand of original by Educational Insights)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My comments are based on Rumis rather than Blokus 3d.  This is an interesting spatial puzzler that should appeal to people that like Tetris.  Like Tetris, you essentially drop pieces onto the playing field and often other of these Tetris pieces.  Unlike Tetris, this is a 3d game and this multiplayer game has people adding pieces into the same field.  Players may only place pieces in places where the new piece will touch one of their previously played pieces, so you have to be careful, not to get cut off from your other pieces.  Each of these 3d pieces are composed of connected blocks and when the game ends players score points based on how many of blocks from their own pieces can be seen from a top down view.  This game comes with a few 'scenarios' which dictate how tall structures can be built and what shape they will look like.  For example you may have scenario that will be built up like a set of stairs or perhaps a pyramid.  This is a nice game for fans of Tetris.  I hear Fits is as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game reminds one of "Pueblo" at first glance, but the big difference is that the players attempt to build their 3D blocks in a way that makes them as visible as possible. "Rumis" also doesn't have an interim VP count like "Pueblo" (which in the latter game sometimes works unfairly), which speeds up the game considerably (one game should take no longer than 1/2 hour). Through the use of variable boards, each demanding a totally different strategy, Rumis develops a unique charm that elevates it from the flood of recent games. It's very simple rules make it a very good "closer" of a games evening. The game rewards clever imagination, and this is something I like!

I am such a sucker for puzzle-type games.

The components are good, but the box and trays are flimsy.  Attractive game.  Simple rules, good strategy, quick game.

If you like this, try Pueblo that adds another element of strategy.  Also, Rumis is like a 3-dimensional Blokus.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Visually interesting game that is best played with more than fewer players.  Blokus scales much better from the 2 to 4 range.  This game does not do it for me with just 2, but with 3-4 it's ok.  Placement rules actually limit the spreading of the colors and forces localized play and cannibalisation of your own areas.

RATING: 6.5
Played twice with two players so far.  I definitely recommend each player use two colors in this situation - the game goes on for a more satisfying amount of time, placement of stones becomes much more difficult, and it's more pleasant to look at.  Otherwise, my feelings on Rumis are pretty much the same as for Blokus: nothing to dislike about it, but nothing very exciting.

Also known as Blokus 3D.  Just because you're good at Blokus doesn't mean you'll necessarily be good at this.  Some of the puzzles are downright challenging as you claw your way to keep your options open while trying to come out on top in as many squares as possible.

Um tetris 3D. Nós temos peças de diferentes formatos e temos que encaixá-las no tabuleiro. Elas devem encostar, pelo menos um lado, em outra peças sua. No final quem tiver mais peças visíveis na vista de topo vence. Divertidíssimo. Ele vem com vários tabuleiros que mudam bastante a partida. Alguns maiores deixando a montagem das peças mais horizontal e outros menores deixando mais vertical. Recomendo!

I enjoy the objective of this game - and it's a quality tactile abstract. The opening game feels a little unsure for all, as if it doesn't really matter where you place, though it sorta does; it's good to keep a couple lines open for placement and to try and cut off the climb of your opponents. In the end the last few turns decides it all, but there is a decent feel of control throughout the game. Looks damn good the whole time as well. Enjoyable for sure.

RATING: 5
Very pleasant 3-D game that shouldn't bog most people down in analysis while their opponents practice patience.  I scored my copy at B&N for $9.95 - 30% + tax = $7.52.  Only negative:  The faces of the pieces are not flat...they tend to be a bit larger at one of the opposite edges.  This makes for a more difficult time keeping the structures together as they expand.  The irony is that the Mayans were able to hew blocks of stone such that they fit together perfectly without mortar.  The makers of this game couldn't find a way to make true cubes molded in plastic with the advantage of modern manufacturing methods!

Added Blokus 3D when it presented itself for a pitance in a thrift store.  After a few plays, the problems that Rumis had with piece fit is eliminated in the Blokus rendition.  However, there are only four templates - perhaps and expansion is in the works?

Tetris in the thiiiiiiiiiiird dimension!  Great variable boards and nice touch with the rotating base!  Often compared to Pueblo, but both games play pretty differently.  I would have a tough time suggesting one over the other.  Rumis plays quicker, so you may want to take that into consideration, and it is easier to explain.  Play both games if you can.  Pueblo is my personal fave, but this is no slouch.

Update: Blokus 3D is a definite improvement over Rumis in terms of production.  Game plays well with non-gamer types.

This is exactly the type of game I am horrible at -- 3 dimensional spatial relations.  If they could make Carcassone 3-D that would be worse, I guess, since there would be more options and more going on.

However, I surprisingly didn't hate playing it, and that's why it gets an average rating.  Which has been bumped down after playing it a few more times.  Just not that fun.

Relaxing game that plays quickly with a very light, friendly feel.  Rumis is one of those games in which the early moves may seem aimless or uninformed, but then suddenly in the middle of the game you can see the board taking shape, and the gameplay crystalizes.  You then see what you need to accomplish, and realize that your past moves have put you in either a good or bad position for the endgame.  Perhaps this is because there are no intermediate goals as there are in Pueblo.  The only thing that matters is the end state, and it's tough to see that far ahead at the beginning of the game.  In that way, Rumis has a similar contour to something like Medina. The second edition with the turntable and the molded plastic pieces is very well presented and visually appealing.

Basically, I just got to a place (with abstracts and with easily-taught family games) where I was reconsidering my dislike of Blokus, and then Rumis swept me away.

3D-ish blockus with a 2D scoring system. This makes for an excellent outdoor game (it takes quite a breeze to disturb the shapes) and the game looks beautiful in progress, often eliciting questions from passing pedestrians...

This is a great little abstract game, and it can be simplified for younger family members.  I like the 3D aspect that makes you play your accessibility with your score.

Downside: it has some very tough maps, and can be a brain burner for those who don't think three dimensionally.  

I printed the expansion maps, and made 2 more sets from wood as expansion instead of paying the sum of over $60 US.  Very worthy!

It's not a bad game, but it has one of the features that kill a game for me: it's pretty easy to be completely out of the game by your second or third piece, so all you can do in play kingmaker. I really don't think that 20 minute games should have a political aspect.

Plays better with 3 than with 2 or 4.

Best with 4.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A unique 3D abstract with some sharp limitations. The rule about having to touch one of your other pieces pretty much restricts you to one part of the structure, with little scope for attacking or defensive play. Taller shapes make the early moves irrelevant, with lower shapes, moves are a no-brainer. You get just 4 shapes in the box (Blokus 3D edition), so look here for more challenging ones. Take care, there's no 'keying' between pieces, so the slightest knock and your game can end with an unscheduled collapse. Not as good as the 2D Blokus editions, but a chance to flex those spatial skills.

Un juego simpático, en el cual a través de fichas similares a  las de te tetris se intenta llegar a la cima y tener la mayor cantidad de cuadros del mismo color vistos desde arriba.

Sin embargo, es un juego que no es ideal para jugar seguido. Al jugarse bastante termina por aburrir. Pensaría que con algún tipo de ficha o variante que le diera más profundidad y opciones que pensar no cambiaría totalmente, pero si darían más ganas de sacarlo a la mesa.

3D Blokus?!  How could it not be good?!

Rumis is a great abstract game that corners the sparse 3D gaming genre.  The play is very similar to Blokus with simple mechanics and scoring yet still invoking a mentally tough tactical challenge.  The components are the truly remarkable aspect of the game though.  It actually comes with a swiveling "Lazy Susan" for rotating the board!  Replayability is also pretty high since there are a variety of different boards in which to build different structures.  Rumis is a great, if not the best, brain burning abstract in the third dimension!

Sep08: Well it's not quite 3D Blokus, but it's pretty close.  It also has a whole "end up on top of the pile" contest at the same time.  In fact, getting all your pieces down isn't nearly as important.

I actually like the third dimension in the spatial reasoning.  It adds some fun thoughts and tough decisions.  It also makes for a very engaging visual as you play as well.

I do like the different boards available.  My version is a little cheap on the turn table though.

If you like multiplayer abstracts like Blokus or Uptown, it's definitely worth seeking this one out.

---

I've got Blokus 3D (not Rumis).  So far I'm deeply disappointed by this edition (really small blocks, tray doesn't rotate with ease, only a few patterns to build, less room to build than in Rumis...).  EDIT: The last issue is not so annoying after a few games - it's tighter than in Rumis, but there IS a room for manouevre, only the fight is more vicious.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
initial rating

Only one game of this but I liked what I saw, pretty much 3-D Blokus which is a good thing and having 4 different boards with a built-in lazy susan was very cool(although they should have been double-sided giving you 8 boards). If you like this and want something more gamey see Pueblo...

More comments to follow after more plays

Update: 7 => 5  The game is mostly broken. A player can be eliminated on his second turn for no fault of his own. The way the boards are designed and the way the rules are laid out players can get eliminated which isn't too bad if its half way through the game or closer to the end but turn two?  Not too cool.  This happened to us with 4 players, maybe three players is best. 2 players is okay but you play with 2 colours each so I think 3 must be best. Might up the rating back if this is true but I dont think I will bother playing 4 again. 

I had high hopes for this since it seemed to take Blokus to the next level but I still think Blokus Trigon is the best of all these games and Pueblo.

This comment is for the Rummis edition with plastic pieces.

2014-05-27

Initial Rating: 5.0 (October 2010)

I don’t like games in which players fight in a free-for-all because at the end it isn’t the best player the one that wins, it is the player who antagonized (or didn’t participate in the fight) the other players the least. I don’t like regular Blokus for this reason and I instead bought and play the travel two player edition. I think I would prefer to play Blokus 3D with 2 players only, still I won’t get the chance as I already sold the game. In this edition of the game, a player can get eliminated rather quickly through no fault of his own, you only need to gang on him and presto!

The first moves you do each game have little relevance, so the game really begins form the midpoint onward (if you haven’t been eliminated). At least the game plays quickly so this doesn’t matter much. In this regard I prefer regular Blokus, at least in that game each move counts towards something.

The components are great, love the movable board and the variable boards. The rules can be explained under one minute. 

I don’t think I will be playing a lot of this and I already sold my copy.

Rumis version. It's a fun 3-D pseudo-Blokus with a more appealing theme. It's especially great if you can pick it up on the cheap, as the name/theme is changing. It's too light to be much more than a good filler, and, at least in my copy, not all of the stones are cut evenly enough to stack well. It really works well only with two or four, with two taking two colors each. The rules for reducing to two (one color apiece) and three players are a bit wonky.

Blokus in 3D. Initially I thought this was just a cheap gimmick but there is actually a really solid abstract strategy game here. It's a clever, super quick, zero luck game that offers interesting decisions every turn without being too much of a brain burner.

Oddly thrilling contest that manages to feel at once cooperative (for the fact that players are all building something together) and cut-throat (for the many possibilities for screwage).  Has made Blokus obsolete for me.  

Beholding the unique structure made at the end of each match is so satisfying.  This scratches the same itch within me that building sandcastles did as a child.

I'd love to see a deluxe version, with heavy marble pieces.  The plastic treatment of the game does not do justice to the game's quality and beauty.

Most commonly available as Blokus 3D (The version I have, though I've given Rumis as a gift), the Blokus name is more loosely tied to the mechanics than with the other games. Still, the rules are easy, if basic strategy is sometimes harder to grasp. Unlike Blokus, you can get blocked out in your first few plays if you aren't careful (or everyone else is out to get you). Avoid playing with drunk people or you'll spend more than a few minutes putting the toppled Tower back together; this ain't supposed to be Jenga!

Can be difficult to plan out ahead of time your moves as the board changes heavily between turns.  Not as good with only two players and with more the randomness seems to increase.  There are some moves that are downright unfair to the other players.  I like the simplicity and the lazy suzan style spinning table is a perfect component for the game.  Wish the pieces were still made of wood not fairly ugly plastic.

Great game in terms of components (although the maps can show edge-wear a little too easily).  The turntable ("lazy susan") and blocks are great... (but the red ones are too close to the green ones in terms of grayscale value for we, the colorblind).  Game play, after 4 games, I found to be both strategic and tactical, but I think it might get messy and non-strategic with more than 2 players.... I have yet to play it with that many.

UPDATE: After owning the game for a few years and playing it a few more times, I think the game shines with four players.

Never fails to draw others into a game. Still fun after many plays over several years.

The pyramid board needs more than two players. On the tower it's fun to score all sides instead of just the top. For kids, the 4x5 Chullpa/Tower board is an OK puzzle. Be sure to check the links section for board-less "Soma" puzzles.

I've owned both Blokus 3D and the plastic edition of Rumis. I hoped to combine them into a six-player version, but Rumis blocks are slightly larger. I have a weak preference for Blokus, because the blocks are more uniform, the board has ridges to hold the base pieces, and the box is smaller. Rumis 2E has more boards.

Visually enjoyable game.  Works well with 2-3, although w/4 I think the luck factor (or jerk factor) is too high, in that other players can crowd you out of the game.  But for 2-3, a solid game.

Print out the 12 variant boards (by Warlord Zen and Schirf) to get a lot more out of this game.  As the game only comes with 4 boards, the 12 extra boards can make a big difference in replayability.

For some reason I just like Blokus better (you know, 2D Rumis). ;>

How do I describe this game? Simple rules, abstract, 3D tetris, fun! That about sums it up. So far I have only played two player games but I suspect the game would improve with more players. Certainly some of the bigger maps aren’t suited for just two but the smaller maps work just fine. So far I’ve found the tension in the game to be in the decision to built up (and secure points) or build out (and secure options). This decision is sometimes straight forward but often is gut wrenching depending on the map, your remaining pieces, and the tendencies of your opponent. Plus this game is extremely tactile. There’s a certain enjoyment, to me at least, in holding the blocks and turning them over as I try to mentally fit them into the emerging temple. That’s a lot of goodness in a small, quick package.

The game plays relatively quickly.  I was expecting a little more depth here but it is fun just the same.  I think I prefer Pueblo.

I just finished a few more games and there is a definite non conformity in the blocks.  If you play the tower scenario the pieces slide off of each other because they are not square or flush.  In a game which relies on block building the blocks need to be of a decent quality.  As such, I have downgraded the game rating to a 5.  The manufacturer should have caught this problem early in the testing process.  Shame on them.

RATING: 7
While I fell in love with this game the first time I played it (then called Rumis), it has a very different feel than traditional Blokus.  In traditional Blokus the game moves forward and at some point pretty close to the end the players start to get shut out of playable areas, so the early game is really about delaying that event.  In 3D, every turn has that late game feel where each turn could be your last, because it could in fact be.  Early eliminations are common, so each turn feels more tense, competitive, and in the moment.  I like it quite a bit, but only in smaller doses than its parent game because of the cutthroat feel.

Game in a Nutshell: Try to stay on top of the pile using unique 3-d pieces. 

Played as: 3,4 player

Pros: Fast, fun, and easily expandable. It's like the game where you go hand-over-hand up a baseball bat to see who will start the game first, combined with 3D-ified Blokus. With all the different starting maps, chances are people could play one to death and simply move on to another for some fresh new strategic possibilities. 

Cons: The number of different pieces available to each person seemed under-whelming. Can't decide yet if turn order too greatly gives an advantage to some players over another.

Other: When compared to Blokus, I didn't like the smaller selection of pieces to choose how to do my bidding, but appreciated how this might actually lead to quicker matches. 

Best Use: The quickest abstract fix out there that I know of for 2-4 players.

RATING: 7
Nifty abstract where players place Tetris-y 3-dimension pieces on a board.  No blank space can be left underneath the pieces and your next move must touch a side of one of your other pieces.  Furthermore, different sections of the board have height limitations.  You play until someone is out of pieces or nobody has a legal move left.  Then you look from the top down and count the squares showing of your color then subtract squares from any unplayed pieces you may have leftover (as in Blokus).    

It's enjoyable and the decisions are not too difficult to make (or too obvious).  However, in a 3-player game I would think that one person would normally have an advantage since two will usually "fight" each other once more.  Biggest downside is that your "friends" could decide to just work together and knock you out of the game early.

I've tied for first but not won this clearly in 4 attempts which I like... as the game is a challenge and makes you use your noodle in different ways than other abstracts like Blokus or YINSH. Building upwards and outwards while being constrained by having to keep in contact with your own pieces is a great mechanism and having 4 different maps to choose from is a bonus as it creates variety in the strategies and tactics used. The game is very simple to learn but the level of thought involved is quite high in comparison to the simplicity of the rule set.

Breed Tetris and Pueblo and slap on the Blokus-brand and you've got Blokus 3D. Doesn't feel much like any of the other Blokus games. It's the kind of game that feels deeper than it is and it has some 'unnecessary' brainburn due not to depth of play or strategy but to the 3D aspect which is seldom used in board games. The luck element is more visible than in the other Blokus games. The endgame/scoring is not to my taste.

Need to get rid of different shaped pieces, by placing them onto a building structure and from the top at game end your building color should be seen. good game for 2, or 3, not so good for 4, since there is less control by the time its your turn again. It should play in half an hour, but with AP types it may become overly long.

First impressions: solid 8.  This is easy to teach and play, but you can have fun with strategy as well.  And it's so fast, and you have the 6 different boards as well as different uses of the pieces when the height limits change with different amounts of players.  My wife loves it AND my mom.  Lots of fun, strategic variety in a fast, tactile package will put this game on my table frequently I predict.

You need to like spatial placements games to like this one. All players receive three-dimensional pieces made of wood, which they will try to position adjacent to their already placed pieces of their own colour. All of their own pieces are of different shape, which is a challenge to the three-dimensional imagination. The different boards add variety. Any more than 2 players though and each play becomes a mini king-make depending on whose space you're invading as there's nowhere near the same number of escape options as for Blokus. Still, for 5-10 minutes, the gameplay is rich.

Like a 3D Blokus (which now bought Rumis and changed the name to Blokus 3D), but better in my opinion. Place you pieces, but you are limited in area and hight. To win, your pieces must be visible from the top and this is reduced by the number of pieces you have left. Lots of strategy on the placement, plays well at 2, 3 and 4.

I picked this up secondhand for about $10. We’re fans of puzzle games such as Blokus and Ubongo, and Rumis hasn’t disappointed. Players take turns stacking 3D pieces onto a grid, with the object of having the most squares of your color visible from above at the end of the game. A variety of boards included with the game change the parameters for building, such as the shape of the base and the maximum allowed height in a given area. Rumis is a fast-playing game and is something I see us coming back to on a regular basis.

RATING: 7.5
Update:  This is a neat game, but it's all too easy to get squeezed out early.  Thank goodness it plays pretty quickly so that if you're pinched out in the first round you aren't waiting too long.

This is a very solid game just like how Blokus 2-D is.  If you like abstract and spatial games, this is probably up your alley.  The game comes with a bunch of different templates to play on to, so there is a lot of variety in play.  I wish Blokus 2-d had a mechanism like this.  The only complaint I would have with this game is that when you play with more than two players, it is possible for someone to get eliminated very early in the game.  It doesn't happen often but can, especially if that player wasn't being mindful about the possibility of two players cutting them off.  The games are short so it isn't as bad as I make it sound.  This is a good 10-20 minute brain burner that I haven't ever had a bad time playing.  This has a lot of similarities to Blokus 2-D but don't be fooled by the bright colors.  In a competitive game, this one can get nasty.  Blokus 2-D lets you think you have a chance at winning until the very end.  If you play a bad move in Blokus 3-D and your opponent or opponents zing you,  you know it immediately, all your moves are played from a poorer position.
 Good filler with no luck.  Never regretted playing it.  Very easy to learn.

This game can feel as if it were the 3-D version of Blokus, but the play and the technics are totally different.  Rumis is an abstract game which I wouldn't categorize as a 'strategy' game. With two players, strategizing will be very effective, but with 3-4, you can only make the best tactical move that is available to you at the time.  The game can be an interesting and fun occasional diversion from 'regular' board games. The novelty of the colorful, attractive geometric shapes will attract people, but the game play does not reenforce the attraction as much. Overall, I rate Blokus slightly higher.

Rumis version - 
7 is HIGH for me for an abstract spatial puzzle game (they are not my favorite genre). It probably gained 1 full point because of the nice components, the lazy susan, and the cheap price ($9 at B&N).
It is better than most abstracts that I've seen because the board layout can change (up to 6 official boards, and more fan-made) and it's 3-dimensional.
Can easily be played younger than the official age (8+).

Aka Rumis. Brilliant and fun game which seems to work nicely with 3-4 players. You can block players off, but that might come back to haunt you.

The tactile experience of the game is fun, the wooden blocks are brilliant and along with the board, he game is very colorful.

I like Blokus 3-D, but I'm not really all that good at it.  It has player interaction and conflict but I don't feel so bad when I get screwed out of something--probably because one game is so short that I don't have time to hold a grudge.  It's a clever game.  Since I am a fan of short games, Blokus 3-D is a good game for me.  It's also got a lot more interesting spacial challenges than any of the icehouse games I've played (most of the abstracts that I play are icehouse).

I can appreciate this game but just haven't been able to have it click either with me or a group. Maybe with time I'll get it, but as it stands this is easily the game that sees the least play time in my collection. 

This is actually the Educational Insights "Rumis" iteration of this game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A tremendously well-received stacking abstract that looks a lot like Pueblo but behaves a lot like Blokus. However, it subtly steals and changes elements from both games to offer a very satisfying game for two players -- clearly tactical but with some thinking-ahead built in. It also plays fast -- you could fit half a dozen plays in the time it takes to play Pueblo once. Once you get the hang of Rumis, you'll notice its overall feeling is markedly different from both Pueblo and Blokus. You don't have to rush your weirdest pieces to the table simply to feel relieved -- and you certainly will progress little if you bury them under enemy colors. You must instead "think ceiling": only those pieces seen from above will count. It is a very different objective, requiring other sorts of tactics.

I will refrain from recommending Rumis to three or four until I test it so. My belief is that, in that vein, Pueblo might work better for larger groups.

I also would steer clear of the variant for longer two-player games (two colors each), though. It seems to only add a lot of confusion and dilute the game's markedly coherent, tight dueling for area control.

Played for the first time using the "2005 Educational Insights version".  The cardboard boards have nice artwork while the turntable is simple black plastic.  The plastic pieces are adequate but not uniformly flat-faced so after stacking they are prone to slippage -- not enough that they fell out, but it seemed we were constantly tapping them back into place. (18 MAY 2008)

RATING: 7.5
Abstract game that is quick but requires a good amount of thought.  There is good variety with each of the four set ups and the strategy is a little different for each. I enjoy this much more than regular Blokus just for the fact it plays in less time thus has less of a work feel.

After an initial flurry of play, I'm giving this an 8. I am losing miserably, but I'm having a blast while I'm doing it. That feeling I get seeing someone cover my pieces in a way I didn't think they could is a fun kind of anger. I was a little bummed that some of the game boards were warped out of the box, but they still hold the pieces in the proper places.

woah.  Multi-player abstract spatial without too much brain burning.  It's fast, it's pretty, it's strategic!

Good 3D "Tetris" game.  One of my favorite abstract games.  I wish the base game came with more building designs to play with and that the pieces were a little bigger.  Make them out of wood would have helped too, that is just me being picky.  The extra boards you can download are good too.

While I am not a fan of abstract games in general, this one (along with Blokus) really struck me as fun. Perhaps it is the Tetris player in me. The different building "plans" take different sorts of mind sets - especially the stair one. If you get too greedy too early, you WILL be locked out of the rest of the game. It took me a few times to realize that and I just thought that layout was broken.

Since I love "2-D" Blokus so much, I thought adding another dimension would make it even cooler!  But for me 3D Blokus just doesn't feel as fun and is more of a brain burner.

RATING: 7
Rumis is a very elegant game of building three dimensional structures. Although Blokus is often likened to Tetris, Rumis actually captures the feeling better in my opinion. And I like playing Rumis a whole lot more than Tetris (or Blokus). Rumis scales really well from 2-4 players, unlike Blokus which is at it's best with four and good with two but loses something with three. The theme is nicely done: players take turns placing blocks to create ancient Incan structures. There are four that come with the game. There are few rules. Primarily, your placements are subject to a height limitation and you must always make contact with one of your own pieces (first play excepted). The structures are constructed upon a Lazy Susan, which conveniently allows players to rotate the project obtain a rather useful change in perspective. Spatial reasoning skills are certainly rewarded here, yet there is a depth (no pun intended) to the game that makes it surprisingly accessible. It's great to play with children, and fun even for adults of differing skill levels. Part of this is due to unexpected results - part of it is due to the nature of building something together with another person. In Rumis, you are working together in a concrete fashion, even though you are trying to get more "points". This cooperative feel creates an environment of kibbitzing: "Oh, I don't know if I'd make *that* move!" Looking forward to many future plays.

A Qwirkle után játszottam az első partimat ezzel a játékkal és körülbelül ugyanolyan kellemes élménnyel álltam fel. Talán ez a játék jobban bünteti a rossz lépést, mint a Qwirkle, adódik logikusan a kevesebb elemből és lépésből, ez alapján talán nehezebb is a játék, de nagyon jó élmény mindenfelől megnézni az épülő magas építményt. A játékosok előre gyártott különböző formájú elemeket próbálnak úgy beépíteni a készülő építménybe, hogy a végén fölülről minél több saját színük látszódjon. Zseniális kigondolás, kellemes megvalósítás. Én a Rumis változattal játszottam, amiben még fa elemek szerepelnek, ezekkel biztos kellemesebb a játék, mint az új kiadás műanyagjaival. Jó játék a Rumis, kellemes átvezető.

RATING: 6
I think I like this game much more in concept than in practice.  There are a number of moments in the game where there just aren't any good moves.  Constantly you are faced with the choice to grab a lame point or two get closed off and stuck with the negative pieces in your hand, or keep yourself afloat give big scores to the player on your left.  If one player is playing over agressive and another over defensive other players are handed with no good options.  Often, no matter what you do the result will be frustrating.  Still, if you don't take it seriously, it is a fun puzzle.

I was quite impressed with this on my initial outing.  We played the Wall board, and the game came down to a lot of tough decisions on where to place pieces in consideration of what pieces opponents still held.  I like the various-sized pieces, and the height restrictions to make for a quick but somewhat brain-burning game.
----
Since that initial outing, we've played several games more.  I think I prefer this only with four rather than three or two, primarily because of the building limits and the diversity of turns.  I still dig it a lot, though.  Right up there on my spatial reasoning games.

I don't know why Rumis is being called Blokus 3D on BGG because Rumis came first BUT I have Rumis, NOT Blokus 3D. Apparently a company called Sekkoia bought the rights to Rumis and re-packaged and re-branded Rumis as Blokus 3D. Pretty stupid to do since Rumis is an award winning game and Blokus 3D is NOT BUT Rumis existed first.

Rumis, NOT Blokus 3D is a fun game. It gets played once in awhile and is a fairly quick game.I have played it several times with my current game group and they all seem to really like it. It has some strategy for those strategy game lovers. It's simple enough that anyone can learn it quick and play it. Its not to simple where it becomes a child like game and just plain cheesy.

Like pringles you can't just eat one. I don't think we've ever pulled this out, played once and put it away. It demands "just one more go".

This works well with adults and very well with younger cousins.

Similar to Blokus, but 3D... hence the reissue as "Blokus 3D". The trick is that the scoring is not based on using all pieces, but on the number of spaces visible from above when the game ends. There are a variety of boards which enforce different horizontal shapes and different height limits.

It's one of those difficult games where early placement is very free and late placement is very restricted. I never know what I am doing early on, and I am interested in finding out if there is actually strategy to it. Plays very quickly and rules are simple. Nice wooden blocks in my edition.

[Educational Insights 2005 edition] {Abstract; spatial connection} Rumis is nice spatial (3-D) abstract game. It's suitable for families and students. Like most abstract games, the rules are simple but it takes time to master.

Pirka is the easiest and can be used as the entry game. Chullpa is the most challenging. Nonetheless, I like Coricancha the most because I like pyramids.

The bits are very pretty and sturdy. The pattern and color tune of the blocks are so attractive! The round table is nice and is useful for other games. It's preferable to create maps for yourself to increase the fun and variety of plays.

I got lucky and found this game at Target!  Takes the best of Blokus and Pueblo (quick and strategic) and tops it off by creating a play system (dominoes, piecepack, Alpha Playing Cards) because you can use the sturdy blocks and multiple boards to play many existing puzzles, and perhaps create new games.  The turntable is also very well made, and turns slowly so that your buildings don't topple over.  All of this, and the solitaire is challenging as well, pushing this to a high rating for me.  Also works great with kids.  Quick play time means this will get onto the table a lot as a filler, or intro/outro game.  Box is a little large making this a little tough to carry around conveniently, but that's a small price to play for such quality bits and a fun game.  Only downside is that a couple of the boards can result in player elimination if players don't plan carefully to expand later in the game, so when I play with new players I always warn about this, or else I play one of the 2 boards that rarely if ever have player elimination (the stairs and the L-shaped wall).  Very popular with kids who enjoy making puzzle shapes when it's not their turn.  The expansion boards with the 2 & 3 player variants which were posted in the file section are fantastic!!!  Much preferred to Blokus since this plays with 2 or 3 players, and doesn't have minuscule pieces.

I suspect this works better with a smaller player count as it seemed far too easy for one player to get shut out, but Blokus 3D is a perfectly fine little filler that didn't excite me at all.

I'd be happy to try it again with only 2 players.

It was only a matter of time before they re-branded Rumis to Blokus 3-D. The game is much like Blokus, very simple, easy to learn, difficult to master. Initially, luck plays a much bigger role in playing the game than Blokus because the ways to do well in the game are less readily apparent.

For whatever reason the game a a bit less fun than Blokus. The variations on the initial game are nice, but ultimately, it just doesn't hold a candle to the original. With more plays, I may change my mind.

Rumis version.

Scales well from 2-4, plays well with young kids and adults.

More fun than Blokus for me, but I still don't find myself reaching for it unless I am playing with kids.

I do enjoy watching the structure grow and it really does look like an Incan ruin in the end (the theme in the Rumis version).




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5

It makes perfect sense that this was recently re-branded as Blokus 3D since it is so clearly like a three-dimensional version of Blokus. Blokus is one of those games that gets better with more plays, so I assume Rumis would also improve with more plays. The first play was really just exploring the system and the pieces, feeling my way through without any semblance of a plan. Puzzle-type games like this seem to particularly reward repeated plays.

Played two player Rumis. Pretty fun! Basically 3D blokus with placement of bricks. The height limitation maps are actually quite interesting and much more intriguing and strategic since not every piece will fit on the board. Light game and a good filler. More maps required though

The Educational Insight edition have bricks that don't align very well. The structure is rickety. Cheap shoddy material.

This game breaks several of my game preference standards.   I do not generally care for perfect information abstracts, and more specifically, I am not crazy about Blokus. For some reason the 3d nature of this one calls to me.  Part of the enjoyment definately comes from turning the game around and trying to visualize different possibilities.  I enjoy this during my turns and during other people's turns too.  Despite all this contemplation, games tend to be pretty quick.

Another abstract.  There's an interesting 3D building component to this one, but it's not enough to hold my attention.  It's not simple enough to be charming the way that Blokus is.  There's lots of abstracts in this category, and this one doesn't distinguish itself enough to be special.  I'd rather play [gameid=3228] for a variation on this theme.

This is an interesting combination of Blokus and Pueblo.  Once you pay attention to the height restrictions based on the number of players, the game gets much better.  It's tense and fun, but it's also prone to player elimination, which is something I don't like (especially in 2-player games).

In the game Blokus 3D the players construct an Inca building with their stones. All players receive three-dimensional pieces, which they will try to position adjacent to their already placed pieces of their own colour. All of their own pieces are of different shape, which is a challenge to the three-dimensional imagination.
\13\ \13\ 
Cubic, wedge-shaped or pyramidal volumes are different building limitations, which are imposed by the various building scenarios. Playing Blokus 3D you will find that no game is similar to any previous one. Once your mind has mastered the puzzling shapes of the Blokus 3D pieces, you will explore the depth of tactical and strategic possibilities offered.

RATING: 4
This is apparently a re-branding of Rumis, an abstract that requires players to follow a building template which allows their pieces to be legally played in three dimensions. The Blokus name is a little misleading, because there is very little here that links the two games other than having to place your pieces touching your own colors. It's not terrible, but it feels like more of a toy than a proper game.

Good, simple game. Popular with non-gamers. Not all the boards are great with any number of players though.

I have the original "Rumis" version and was shocked to discover it was actually rebranded and released as Blokus 3D! It was a pet peeve of mine that on first play, so many people said "oh, it's like Blokus, but three dimensional!" when in fact, the placement mechanics and strategy are entirely different from Blokus... all that the two have in common is, well, that you're placing colored blocks.

A very nice 3D abstract game with lots of replay value, but far, far more cut throat than Pueblo or Blokus, the two abstracts I find closest in terms of strategy/feel. However, Rumis plays in about 1/2 the time of either, so a particularly brutal session will end quickly, anyway.

RATING: 7
Rumis is deceptively simple at first, so much so that I was completely unimpressed after reading the rules, but one session was enough to make me realize that this is actually 3 different games in one packaging.  First and foremost, it is all about area control.  You can't let yourself be cornered and blocked off from open areas, since the game ends immediately when you can no longer place any more pieces legally on the board, this is especially important on the Chullpa.

Second, it's about making life harder for the other people.  Taking up premium spaces while burying as many of their colored faces as possible.  Although I'm not big on player elimination, but that is exactly what you want here.  Creating situation so that they can't perform the next move.

Lastly, it's a race to reach to top level first, because you can't never violate the height restriction, so that means if your color is the highest, it is a point in the bag that can't never be covered up.  These three "games" work in conjunction with each other to provide a fun and thoroughly satisfying experience.  There are just so many things to consider when you are choosing that next piece to place.

I've only tried this with two players, which I'm not too fond of.  Since each person controls two colors, there were just too many instances where one set gets completely ganged up thus ending the game prematurely and with an entirely lobsided score.  Now this could possible be due to the difference in skill level but I imagine Rumis should play better with more.

Pleasant, cutthroat positioning game.  This definitely would be better with solid pieces, rather than the hollow plastic of the [company=765][/company] version.  Really, they couldn't have playtested it with the final components.  The lazy-susan is concave, which causes severe instability once stacks are higher than four cubes high.  Even if you shim it to flatten and stabilize it, the hollow plastic pieces knock each other about, really damaging the game experience.  The solid pieces of [gameid=3228] permit stacking, but [gameid=6411]'s do not.  Most unfortunate.  The game design is quite fine, though!

More of a puzzle than a game, at least for two players.  There's not enough draw, somehow, to encourage us to keep playing this game... consequently, the opportunity for intelligent play is lost to lack of practice or interest in development of our Rumis skill.  (Maybe suffers from the difference in spacial skills between my wife and I).

Nettes Spiel wo man nicht weiß wer zu einem gehört und es im laufe des Spieles herausfinden muss. Aber ein Problem hat sich jetzt aber herauskristalisiert, als wir das Spiel zum 2. mal spielten und alle bescheid wußten. Dann haben alle jeden Angriff versucht zu verhindern damit die anderen an keine Informationen herankommen. a fehlt etwas am Mechanismus. Deshalb zurückstufung von 7 auf 6

I can't think of anything wrong with it, apart from lack of depth. Is there any reason why a very simple card game should not be a 9 or a 10? It seems to be a good three-player.

A great little card games where players must rid themselves of all 6 of their cards by combining them in a decent sequence, while taking every possible opportunity to stitch everyone else up. Lots of interaction if you play it right. My 12 yr old loves this one.

A fun little card filler with lots of nastiness and ways to stitch up your opponents. I really liked the gameplay and I would probably rate the game itself higher but for the gripe that most of the hands seem to end with one person busting (so everyone else scores a point). As you only play to 4 points, this seems to mean that several people get to 4 points after only 4 or 5 rounds and a tie-breaker comes in to effect.

Update - this only seems to happen with 5 players, it is much easier to win a round with 3 or even 4. Uprated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
So, the best thing that may happen to you in Palast Geflüster is not being called into to play and let the others handle each hand. This way one of them will be forced into playing a suicide card and you’ll be awarded one point for doing absolutely nothing to deserve it, just like everyone else.

This means that, whilst the basic idea is decent, the game as a whole feels kinda broken.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------

Interesting card game like love letter that probably outstays its welcome.  I had fun, but the game left too long for what it was.  Took us about 45min with 2 new players, but this one probably should only take around 20min.  Wanting to try various player counts, and the game is clever, but we'll see what kind of staying power it has.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun, easy to learn but clever card game. The only problem is that is has some luck factor because if you get 4 cards of a kind you're f%&#ed; up! 

If little luck don't bother you, try it!  

Home made. Print & Play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice little filler. The rules didn't seem promising, but it ends up being quite a clever little game, with some nice combos possible. Sure, it can be chaotic and it does have its fair share of luck, but still, not bad. The scoring is a bit strange, with way too many games ending with ties...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A game of survival, but I don't find it particularly compelling.  I agree with others that this game starts to feel very "same-y" after the first couple of rounds.  When someone is threatening to win the round, you either avoid making it his turn or call his bluff to see if he has the right card or goes bust.  Many times you find yourself on the verge of busting, and you just sit there hoping that nobody makes it your turn again.  There's a lot of meddling with cards so someone might help you by accident.  In fact, you could accidentally make someone win.

BRIEF GAME OVERVIEW -- On your turn you must play a new character card or else you bust and everyone else gets 1 point; if you get 6 of 7 characters to the table, you win the round (and only you get 1 point).  Turn order depends on the background color of the character card the current player plays... so if it's my turn and I play a blue card, then I execute the card and then it's the blue player's turn (if that's me, I go again).

The mechanics are simple.  Although everything is in German (but the rules), the iconography made it simple to figure out.  There is a bit of a learning curve as people figure out card combinations... long term it feels like it would be a light 4some-type card game to play.  Might try it with the kids, but see no reason to bring it to another game night.

Good filler - it comes in a tiny box, has easy rules and plays fast. One of those games where not losing is the quickest way to win. Very good game for its price.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game is quite a unique card game. You always have 6 cards in total in your hand or in front of you. To win you need to play all cards to the table, but they all must be distinct. Each card has an ability to exchange cards with the deck or other players, or return cards to your hand, and so on.

A problem is that it is usually much easier to force another player to lose, by passing play to him, than to win by playing all your cards down.

RATING: 7.8
This game is probably worth an 8, perhaps even higher.  I really enjoyed the chaos manipulation the players need to try and manage in order to win.  There are many moments throughout the game where a player has the opportunity to make a clever play of some kind - which is excellent.

I expect that with repeated play the game will really come alive.

I also like the fact that it is extremely portable, but at the same time as being a small box - is a lot of very enjoyable game.

Kind of an odd game in that many times you're focusing on not losing rather than winning.  Certainly a game of hand management and playing certain cards at key times when their special abilities will benefit you the most.  A neat idea that feels fillery, but lasts a little longer than a filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Based on 1 play with 5 players:

Not bad, but not great. The tension is high... almost TOO high. It can be frustrating to know that you simply WILL lose on your turn if nobody else does anything about it.

The best thing about this game is how scarce cards feel. Since you can't actually gain MORE cards than you start with.

Not sure I see the need to play more than a round of this. I suppose it's to avoid short games where someone just outs themselves quickly, but honestly playing for points made the game feel overly long. Would be kind of a fun quick filler otherwise.

RATING: 8
My experience playing this game is that each card becomes a double edged sword.  Cards each have tremendous offensive or defensive potential depending on the game state.  Determining the optimum time to play the card, and causing the optimum affect while playing it, is difficult to wrap your head around.  Add into this, players that are struggling with the same decisions as yourself and your decision trees get pretty bushy for a little German card game.

This game was ok. Not too deep but ok for a card game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There is very little control throughout the game since players will swap with your cards in your hand and cards that you've placed towards victory.  There are moments that you can have a great deal of effect.

It boils down to luck:  luck in that no one touches your hand or placed cards; luck in that someone plays your color so that you can go next; luck in that you get the right cards; luck in that the king card can neutralize the effect of certain cards at the right time.  I feel like a contestant on a game show put in a large tube with money blowing around me and I have to catch as much money as I can in the maelstrom.

Una pequeña joya!
Escala perfectamente de 3 a 5, y hay una buena dosis de puteo para pasar un buen rato. Muy corto, y es difícil que te conformes con una sola partida. Cuando te lo explican, puede que sea confuso, pero tras las 2 primeras rondas (a los 10 minutos) ya lo has entendido perfectamente.
Recomendable una pequeña variante: Si ganas la ronda, consigues 2 puntos. Solo un puto parece poca recompensa para lo complicado que es de conseguir.
Para mí, el segundo mejor juego en relacion calidad/precio que existe, una compra de la que nadie se arrepentirá.

Takes some time to get a handle on the chaos.  Very tactical game.  You can only play when the game process says it's your turn (and it's not a "take turns clockwise" game).  You have to manage the cards (yours and others) to either try to get all six unique in front of you, or force an opponent to double up.  And you have to know when to do which.  I enjoy it a lot, but then again, it really is right up my alley.

What I liked:
* Fast paced
* Easy to play
* A good amount of strategy for what it is
* Unique mechanic

What I didn't like:
* Can be a bit mean as you need to as a group target one person a bit to win
* Once you get 2-3 behind can be a bit hard for that player to get back
* Might be a bit long for what it is but hands are fairly fast and it is enjoyable enough to want to play a dozen or so hands which is enough to complete the game.

While this game has a lot of fluxx you still feel like you have a good deal of control. You often go from needing just 1 turn to win the game, only to have your hand swapped and all of a sudden if you are given another turn you will loose.

Having it played Love Letter first, Palastgefluster feels to me like an over-encumbered version of the little game that could.  Both rely heavily on luck of the card draw, and both have moments of decision.  There's even a little bit of logic at times.  But for my money, all the machinations of the king's card just feels like spinning wheels to get to a point where the cards tell you who wins.

Players are performing intrigues at a medieval court.  Mechanically simple game where a player on their turn plays a card from their hand, which has to be a card they hadn't already played.  If they can play a card, they perform the card's action, if they can't then they lose the round and every other player scores a point.  If they can play their hand to the table, then they alone scores the point.  Some cute ideas, such as the colour of the card played denotes the next player to play.  Some not so cute ideas are the chaotic actions and random turn order, which means you are being taken for a ride with not a lot of planning to do.  Based on one five player game, some clever stuff but rather random.  I suspect fewer players would improve the game a lot.

Palast tutta la vita!  Surprised 
bastardo e divertente... un Love Letter meno "bello" graficamente ma piu' articolato. Adatto a tutti, facilissimo da spiegare. Economicissimo!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Secondo me Palast è il gioco di carte che ha il miglior rapporto qualità-prezzo-praticità: è molto tattico, scala perfettamente dai 3 ai 5 giocatori, regole e quick reference in italiano, costo basso, formato tascabile da portare e giocare dappertutto.

Not sure there is a whole lot of strategy here, but the way your card's color influences turn order is a neat idea and gives you something to think about.  The scoring system might be suspect, though.  Seems like the game would end in a tie quite often, so we use the total card variant to break ties (it's in the printed rules).  Can be a few rounds too long, but that's an easy fix, too.   There is opportunity for clever play if you are willing to pay special attention to memorizing what cards people have in their hands.

Maybe it was enhanced by fact that we spoke in silly German accents but I was quite engaged by it. The goal is to play six different cards to your tableau in front of you but other players can mess with you so easily that it's ridiculously hard. And if you are forced to play a dupe card to your tableau, well then you lose and everyone else gets a point. My take on the game was that the first five cards you play are skill and then the last one (if you get that far) is complete and utter luck. The planets must be aligned right for you to get that last card down without other players messing with your tableau or trading for the card in your hand to give you something they know you won't be able to use. Makes for great moments of dickery and exasperation. Great little filler.

My one complaint with the game is the scoring. If you go bust on one round, it's practically impossible to climb back into the game. Otherwise, the remaining players who did not bust will battle it out via tie-breaker points. If scoring could be arranged so that players aren't effectively eliminated, it would go up a notch for me. 

Scoring Variant we play with:
[i]
- If you make somebody go bust, it's only you who gets a point. 

- If you go out successfully, you get 2 points.[/i]

Played the basic version with 4 players. Almost all rounds ended when somebody "lost" and couldn't play, so everybody else get +1 points. The immediate result is that the game will often be "won" by many different players, a less-than-satisfying experience. Beside this, it seems like there could be a way to play this game well, but it still eludes me and the strategy that consists in playing the fewest number of cards seems to work pretty well.

Solid filler card game where you can either play to win, or play not to lose both of which require a good deal of hand management and a smattering of luck in getting the right cards. The latter often isn't decisive, though, since there are various ways to change your hand during the game.

It can run a tad long if played to the full 6 points but you can certainly play to less although in that case luck does play a bigger role.

Almost too long to be considered a filler, but light enough it belongs in that role. Better with three, or maybe four players. With five the victory will usually hinge on a final turn tie-breaker, which gets old and starts to feel arbitrary pretty quickly.

RATING: 7
Components: ok cards, treat them with care
Complex: really easy to learn and teach
Weight: light
Players: 4 or 5
Length: around 30 mins
Mechanics: set collection
Decisions: enough for this kind of game, which card to play, who to send the turn, how to apply card effects
Opinion: nice filler in a very small size, portable to almost every place (always in my pocket when I go out).
In a nutshell, you have six cards with 7 different characters, and you have to make a set of 6 different characters in front of you. If you have to play a repeated one, you are out. Turns depend on the color of the card played, and this is a good point. And all 7 characters have their effects, if you play them well you can mess your opponents... yes, mess with them, because in this game is easier to make other player loose instead of going for a solitaire win.
Lovely filler with lot of mean decisions.

We sometimes award two points instead of one for a tableau-filling win, which seems sensible and makes for a more exciting game by rewarding risk-taking.

Neat little card game with a lot of tactical choices, which can be pretty fun for one or two full games. 

It may be that with everyone an expert of the game, it comes down a lot on the initial hand draw and perceived dangerousness. Others have a lot of potential to mess with you, but up to a point and especially if you don't reveal your hand at the beginning. 

The number of players can be high, easily taught, fast played, there is good value here. My only complaint is that this is an abstract game with the theme pasted on. Had I felt somewhat "conspirational", I would have given this at least an eight. 

On the long run this is a solid "7", game, I don't believe I will change this rating in the future for good or ill.

Better than Love Letter, worse than Red7, too similar to both. The brown cards let players target specific opponents to some extent, but oddly I didn't mind that part.

Faidutti-ish list of roles to memorize, also a minus, but relatively manageable here.

I guess really this is a collection of elements I dislike, put together well enough that it's not bad?

I could see it going either way.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (March 2014)

Not sure what to think of the game. Sadly I only played it once and it was an incomplete game. For now I’m willing to give it a 5.0 rating as it seemed like a nice (and novel) card game. However I’m concerned about the game length vs. the game deepness. The rules are very easy, but the gameplay is not so easy, still, you don’t have many cards at hand, so, the best play is still fairly obvious. I’m also concerned about the “attack the leader” factor. It seems to me this game has that in spades, practically assuring an even, long game in which all player are tied until someone manages to pull through. And my last concern, perhaps the game is too chaotic for me if the gameplay time is long. 

Bottom line, I want to play the game fully to see if my concerns are valid or not. 

Current Rating: 5.0

After another play, I’m glad to see I was wrong :D. This is a fun game and it is very hard to play it skilfully.

Love the memory aspect, the bluffing needed to win, the little decisions that are far from obvious (who should play next? What role to play?). The strategy is not apparent, that is, I have no idea how to win this game (love this). The play time is not as long as I feared. Although you can attack the current leader, it is hard to gauge if you are actually hurting him or helping him.

Very easy rules, and you can play it at any level (familiar or gamer).
 
Bottom line, fun game. I already bought it and I want to play it again soon.

Play a card from your hand, execute its function, the color of the card determines the next player. A round ends when one player manages to play six different cards in front of him winning him the round or if a player has to play a card in front of him that’s already present. Everybody else wins the round in that case.

Palastgeflüster is a complex Love Letter developed a few years earlier.  The game itself is ok but there’s not more influence while the game is significantly longer. It’s only advantage is the increased possibility to screw yourself. Obsoleted by Love Letter.

An interesting game - completely uninteresting and unconvincing theme, but I like the puzzle/hand management aspect of the game.  It can get a little tricky, but you can get yourself out of a bind with the cards, in a way that reminds me of Cold War: CIA vs KGB.  It drags on a little too long for my taste, but it's enjoyable for a couple rounds.

Ratings of 7 after 2 plays.

This packs a lot of game into a small deck.  The play time should speed up once all the players know how to play.  Each hand should take probably around 10 minutes.

One disappointing thing about this game is the scoring.  After the hand, you might get one point or no points.  There is just too little variation for a hand.  I may try a variant where you score 6 points for "going out", and if you lose, everyone else scores the number of cards in their tableau.

RATING: 8
A good card game of intrigue and screwing up that reminds me a bit of Citadels because of the atmosphere. For a card game it's really cool that in 90 % of time you don't want to play any cards. On the negative side, winning/losing together is a bit lame, I would have liked to see some other mechanism for scoring.

Bought from Essen 2008. After reading the rules I thought this might be a quite nice one AND it is! Palastgeflüster offers enough decisions to make and is fun. Yes, luck of draw is there, but it doesn't ruin the game. The best Adlung game ever made - definitely. SURE later on 'Love Letter' makes things even better so if you compare this to that, then Palastgeflüster is weaker one, but not that much. Better to own both of these...

Played once, 4 players.  This was much better than I expected.  Normally, I really hate games with a "bluffing" mechanism.  I really don't see it in this game.  The game state is fairly fluid, as cards you've played will occasionally relocate, and the cards in your hand will often change.  Still, I felt I had considerable control over my fate throughout the game.  Will play again.

I'll admit this has some interesting card role elements balancing each other with good rules but it feels like I'm doing the same thing over and over and over and over again and again.  It got boring after awhile.  It has "same"ness issues.  I also feel it probably has "blind kingmaking" issues in most games.  And what I mean by that is, during the final round(s), someone who is not in contention to win, will very likely (and unwittingly) decide who will win (while not be able to help him/herself) in that round.  I kind of find that annoying after I've done this and that over and over again.

RATING: 6
Another solid, fun filler card game from Adlung.  Basically, each player is seeking to either organize a set of 6 cards with each being a different role OR try to set someone else up to be the victim of deadly whisperings!  Each of the 6 different cards have different abilities effecting card play.  An interesting twist to the game is that the color of the border of the card played indicates which player plays next!  Brown border cards means that whoever has the smallest display will play next (and if there is a tie for smallest display, then the person who played the card selects which of the tied players will get to play next).  If you play the same type of card to your own display that you already have, then you are subject to deadly whisperings and the round ends and everyone else gains a point.  As well, there are 6 king cards which can be brought into play which cancels the effect of one of the cards.  Two things I find annoying is that the game usually goes on too long for what it is, and it frequently ends with multiple winners rejoicing in a shared victory.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very cute little  card game with the clever mechanic that allows you to try to make someone else bust or go for the victory of the round yourself.  The different card powers and the king cards allow for clever, tactical play.  I like the mechanic by which the card you play also dictates who takes their next turn.  Endgame problems keep this from being a favorite.

RATING: 9
I think this is a true overlooked gem. It's easy to teach and learn, it's fat packed with strategy (and difficult decisions) and it's all tucked away in a little card box. The only complaint I can give is that it goes on a little long (unless you either play to fewer points or award points differently) and the player aid card is in crazy tiny print. Other than that, I very much recommend it.

PS: Absolutely play with alternate scoring. If you successfully put down 6, you get 6 pts and others get 0. If a player busts, they get 0 and everyone else gets a point for each card in their tableau. Play to # of players x 6 (or something lower for a shorter game). Makes a huge and fun difference!

This game has a cool turn order mechanic, whereby the colour of the card played determines who plays next. This adds an extra layer of strategy to the decision of what card to play, which makes this game rather unique. The scoring feels a little clunky, and a single good hand can win the game, with everyone else tied for second (at least, it felt this way in the game I played). It's possible that with more experienced players, the game becomes a little more competetive.

The main downside to this game is the card art and design. The use of colours is not friendly to colour-blind people, and although the designers have included symbols to differentiate players and cards, it's a bit hard to read these (let alone from across the table).

Neat, but it takes too long if you don't use the variant in which the sole winner of a round scores two points instead of one.  That's a very sensible amendment since it's generally a lot tougher to win than it is to make someone else lose.

A very clever and unique card game.  There are 7 types of cards in the # of players +1 (in a three player game there will be 4 kings) and each player wants to play one of each type in a hand.  If you do this you get 1 point, if you play your cards and end up with 2 of the same type of card the round ends and all your opponents receive one point.  Each card has a special ability that must be used.

The game is very clever.  You may realize that you cannot go out this round, but never lose your poker face, your opponent may not be able to either and lose before you...or play a card that ALLOWS you to go out!

Good game.

I really liked the turn-order mechanic of the game. The next player is the player whose card was previously played or there is one neutral color where the player with least cards on table gets turn. The game itself is interesting hand management where you must either try to be able to play 6 (different) cards on table to score point or wait/push someone so s/he's unable to play so everyone else gets a point. The game works better with more but with 5 players it gets harder to see how some cards can manipulate board as everyone is having 4-5 cards on table. Four players seemed to be a good number for the game. Three is a bit too few.

Update: Unfortunately it seems to be too often when you have cards that are close to impossible to be able to play well. You just hope someone else busts out first (or wins) which is rather uninteresting.

Palastgeflüster is an excellent game, but needs to be modified for colourblind players (like me).
There are 65 high quality cards and multi-language instructions packed into a small tuckbox. The artwork is quite good, and the English language rules are clear and to the point.
The goal of the game is to either play five different cards face up in front of you, or to force another player to play a second card of any type. If you get all the cards out, you alone score. If one player is forced to play a duplicate, they don't score and everyone else does. This continues until someone scores as many points as there are players participating. Ties seem likely, but there is a tiebreaker.
Palastgeflüster is great fun. You need to read your opponents carefully- is he nervous because he's about to play a matching card, or does he have different cards in his own colour (which will let him win)?

Has some neat ideas. Many games in and play's quickened up. There are patterns, and some obvious ways to best play cards, but each hand seems to play differently enough for it to keep coming out. Especially as we seem to get good laughs out of a lot of hands, with people being cleverly targeted and hosed. There's lots of secret "pick me, pick me" and "don't pick me, don't pick me" pleas going on in people's heads whilst they try to maintain a cool poker face.

The problem with this game is that it was Adlung's first released game after Kutschfahrt! This latter one is an outstanding game of intrigue and mystery where two teams face off against each other without any of the team members knowing who their teammates are in the beginning of the game. When I heard of this game for the first time I though "Another great game coming my way". The title "Palastgeflüster" implies more intrigue and loads of player interaction! Turns out it is nither! So it was a bit disapointing in the sence that the game isn't at all what I was expecting. Nevertheless, it is a very fun card game. Players will have a laugh on this one, just don't expect anything nearly as cool as Kutschfahrt (in my Opinion the jewel in Adlung's collection!!)

Filip told me that he has had a game were there were 3 consecutive turns that someone can finish with 6 different characters, while imho it's far better to have less characters and make your opponents accumulate a lot, forcing them to play a double. Statistically, this makes far more sense.

Partial first play which preceded another game similar in feel (Bacchus's Banquet): there is no traditional clockwise turn order; instead turn order is passed by the active player's choice, though here it is restricted by card colour played or game status conditions. 

This is a quirky going out style game in which you win if you play all 6 different action card types or score if forcing a player to play a duplicate. Thankfully the card actions are icons which are straight forward and eliminates text reading (which can slow down game play) as well as making it playable worldwide. 

Ok game with some interesting sequencing of actions, with one major strike being that someone can sit out not doing much until his/her colour is played.

A decent card game with one interesting and unusual mechanic and that is that the colour of the card you play determines who takes the next turn, which has an unique but quite tactical feel to it. The special powers of the characters remind of of Citadels, which is not a bad thing. It is a bit unfortunate that the game is in German and despite featuring English writings on the reference sheets, it takes a while to get used to it. Furthermore, I a have yet to find out how strategic or luck based this game actually is, but for now, it is a solid filler and I suspect there is potential for the rating to increase with more plays.

Conversely, once you expect a loss of control, your control of the game becomes as strong as the game allows.

Interesting card game where you try to either get a full court out on the table or force another player to play the same type of card to their court or play a jester when they are out of favor.  The scoring mechanism of the game was odd and we played a variant where you keep track of cards played to the table in order to break ties since several players could technically "win" at the same time.

For me it's the best Adlung game and with most games the speed of play improves significantly with a few rounds under your belt. Solid little card game that's a bit different. Can be just a little bit long to overstay it's welcome - I suppose you could drop the victory points needed. Actions of cards are easy to learn from the graphics after a few hands. Better than usual Adlung English rules. For all the perceived luck and chaos it seems the better player consistently wins the game - must be some good decisions being made in there somewhere.

If you view this as Rummy, and trying to go out first without being too aggressive, then the actual mechanisms are boring (just play a card when it happens to randomly be your turn). If you view this as a signaling game, then there's so much chaos that goes on, and the cards are hard and not fun to memorize (color + character + possible location). Not sure this combination works well either.

The scoring system is terrible. Provoking Dark Whisperings is the fun part of the game, but once somebody goes ahead, you rarely want to provoke it. Maybe try a couple different scoring variants.

Palastgeflüster -- Played once; four-player.

A lot to enjoy, but if players actually attempt to play well, it takes far too long for so light a game.  

For me, the character powers and chaotic play give this game a decidedly Faidutti feel.

The color of the card played determines who plays next.  Yes, if you play your own color, you go again.  To balance this, there are two complete cards sets of non-player color.  When these are played, the next player is the one with the fewest cards in his display — which essentially translates to the player who has played least.  This helps balance the game, and reduce frustration.

Hand cards consist of seven types.  The separate King cards act to cancel the special power of one type of hand card — until the next King card is revealed.  This definitely affects the timing of card play, since sometimes players want to avoid the effects of their cards, and sometimes they [i]don't[/i].

Played once with 4P. Palastgeflüster can't be blamed for not trying a different approach to a light set-collection game – there are fresh ideas in this, such as the turn order decided by the card which was last played and a few characters hindering players more than helping them.

An initial drawback is that the game is repetitive and long, but that can be easily fixed by adjusting the points needed for victory. A less easily-solved drawback is that despite the depth of card effects, a lot of control is taken from players. Players can never tell when their turn will roll around next, whether the cards they have in hand will have their effects trigger, and so on. Granted, there are moments of brilliance when the card interactions just click together, but otherwise I'd rather play a game of [thing=129622][/thing] instead.

Rather playable small box game that scales well. Players have a hand of cards they are trying to rid. These cards represent characters with different abilities (swap cards with another player, discard a card to draw a card etc) which are triggered when played.

The fun begins when players start to interact by using their character abilities. Most of the fun comes when a player somehow screws themself over by letting other players know what it takes to take them down...which just mean that all the other players win that round.

Some clever ideas (I like how the colour of the card you play determines the next player to play a card).

Cute card game where you use special powers to try not to lose.  I'm a big fan of games where there is one loser and the rest winners.  Sadly, instead of just allowing this to happen the system enforces players to play to 6 points. So rather than just having it be fast and fun, the tedium sets in and it becomes overly repetitive.  

This game should be played for one hand, and if you want to play it again, then do so.  Scrap the points, but allow either for one loser, or one winner if they shoot the moon.

If played strictly like that this might get up to a 7.

RATING: 6.5
A fun, relatively quick filler; once everyone knows what all the characters are. It's a game of hand management and bluffing.

--- Summary ---
Everyone is assigned a color. Deal out all the cards, which each have a color and type (different members of court, with unique powers). Starting player plays a card, which may have a power; it also shows which player goes next (if a neutral color, choose from amongst players with the fewest cards in their tableau). A separate King deck shows the type of character currently out of favor; those powers are canceled (until the next King card is revealed). The hand ends if either you're forced to play a card of a type already in your display or if you must play the jester when the King bans it (you lose; everyone else gets 1 VP); OR if you play 6 characters into your tableau (you win, getting 1 VP). First player to 4 VP wins. The tie breaker: after each hand, record the number of characters in each player's tableau; the sum of these over the course of the game breaks all ties (higher is better)!

Played this again recently, and I realised that it actually has a lot in common with the more recent Love Letter: it's mostly random, because the cards you're dealt and how much your opponents target you largeley determine your result. As one of my geekbuddies suggested, it's probably better to award a single win with two point: it allows players to come from behind and rewards risk-taking (otherwise it's usually best to pick on the player in a weak position).
******************
Bizarre and ultimately random card game, that is entertaining enough nevertheless. There is room for some interesting decisions, but it's really hard to complete a set of six different characters. Usually, you're at the mercy of the colour of the cards you and your opponents are dealt. So I have the feeling that it's very hard to actively influence your results.
But still, I've had fun playing this. It sure does get tense when it gets to the final cards!

Small Adlung card game of hidden roles. Players are trying to get rid of all of their cards, each of which has a special ability. You lose if you play more than one of a kind, but playing is compulsory; different cards provide different ways to wriggle out of a forced loss.

It's a cute enough game that I appreciate more than I enjoy. The luck factor is OK but it has a tendency to run long.

All interest in it has been killed by the much faster Love Letter and Coup.

This is not dazzlingly good, but it does work perfectly well and will I think be very useful in making counteroffers to people who want to play Citadels.

What's difficult is when there's somebody who has to ponder about it, because there's not a lot to do when it's not your turn.

[Adlung Spiele 07 edition] {Medieval, Beer&Pretzel; set collection, hand management; optimal 5p} Palastgeflüster is a unique card game for its mechanic.  Actually, it is a fun and interactive card game for nasty players.  Usually, players need to find a way to make a player trigger a dark whisper rather than having 6 different characters before themselves.  The game can be explained in 5 minutes; however, players need some time to remember the function of the cards and icons.  It is a nice filler but I am concerned about the replayability for the same group.

I like the card illustrative.  It's colorful and vivid.  The icons are informative.  Nonetheless, I prefer English names.  In addition, the text of the player aid is too small.

we had a decent time the first couple of times we played this, but I think it's going to get boring if we break it out again. The chief concern is the liklihood of ties (if I recall). Very interesting/innovative mechanics here, which I think is the main reason I give it 6. Also plays very quickly and so is excellent in that regard. It's too bad, as the mechanics are very interesting, however the strategies of where it's going dont seem to be fully formed. Worth taking a look at.

4->7->6

I don`t know, why i have rated this game at 4.

It`s not a game where you have many choices, but you can`t choose the cards random. You must play a card. The color of the card show who will be next. When someone plays his sixt card, wins a round. But you can`t play the same card twice. The more cards you have played that more difficult it is to play another card (there are only seven different).

Every card has some effect for the game. In some way similar to Love Letter, but a little bit more complex.

Edit: I think in LL at the end of a round you could assume what card another player have. Here it`s more difficult. Very rarely you will be able to win a round, so usually you will try that another player loses the round, so everyone could get 1 point. At the end of a game you will try, that the player with the most points loses the round.

Interesting, but I like LL more.

Interesting card game where the player turn order isn't fixed. Instead the player who goes next depends on the colour of the last card played!

A light game where players race to empty their hands using special card powers to get around the limitation that players may have only one of each type of card played in front of them. Not deep and player control and options can sometimes be pretty limited, but it's also very quick, so the high luck factor isn't a huge downside. A better-than-average card game that's all the more appealing given Adlung's great pice point.

Very different card game for 3-5 players. Only played with 5 players so far. Trying to grok how the cards interact takes a few rounds. After that though, the icons on the cards take over and it is very clear the function of the cards to see quickly what you can do. Not a lot of control sometimes. The Zauberer is very powerful when timed properly or it can be a total dog if played improperly. Other than the strong dose of luck, the only downside is that one can have a lot down time between turns if one's color is not played. Will need to play more to see if there are more levels of complexity in it.

I guess it depends on the crowd you are with...if you do a bit of roleplay, I suppose it's probably more fun. But I am just not that type.

Lots more to it than meets the eye. Great for a filler, especially since the game length need not be fixed.

Siete personajes, cada uno hace una accion excepto el bufon que solamente provoca conjura cuando esta el rey de los bufones. Si alguien coloca seis personajes distintos gana un punto, si provoca conjura repitiendo personaje todos ganan un punto menos el. Muy divertido, puteo al máximo y muy dinamico. De los mejores filler

A nice fun, light quick game. It'd be a good game to play with non-gamers if it had an English printing, but as it is it's got some interesting tactical decisions and it seems like it'd have good replayability. Interesting mechanic on whose turn is next.

An amusing little game - purely tactical, but fine for what it is. A bit long with 3 players, but I suspect it might actually be shorter with more. If not it's easy enough to lower the target score.

With five players, this game feels totally random and is much too long for what it offers. None of us felt he/she had sufficient control over the proceedings. I almost won by not thinking at all and only playing any legitimate card from my hand whenever it was my turn. As far as I am concerned, there is some good artwork wasted on this game. Bad.

The main mechanic was quite interesting and enjoyable. However, a bit longish and the scoring was a bit problematic.

Does a lot with a little. Doesn't have as many 'a-ha!' moments as Citadels, but I prefer the card play of this game.  The card design in my edition makes it hard to read the king cards - let's hope this gets an English printing

Un juego en apariencia sencillo y simplote peeeero que tiene muchísima estrategia. Mucha más de lo que aparenta. Partidas dinámicas y rápidas y una caja reducida, hacen de él el juego ideal para llevar siempre en la mochila o en el bolso y sacarlo en cualquier lugar. 
Muy recomendable

Love Letter killer, in my opinion.
Though it is still require deeper thinking in the game but the leader bashing element in the game is quite amusing. This game needs more spotlight.

RATING: 8
A fun card game. Either get stuck on your turn and give everyone a point or be able to play all 6 of your cards without getting stuck and be the only one to get a point. A 4 player game goes to 5 points. The rounds play quickly and it is usually over after 6 or so rounds.

RATING: 7
Interesting card game. You start with 6 cards. You try play all of your cards to your court (you must play 6 of the 7 different types of cards) or force one of your opponents into having to play a duplicate card. The cards have special abilities (powers) that you must use. Also the color of the card you play chooses the next player. Card management, strategy, tactics, are all good. Needs to be played quickly.

RATING: 5.5
Played once (with 4 players). Some interesting ideas (such as the order in which players get their turns, or the King cards which neutralize the special powers, which may be beneficial or not), but the game is quite luck-dependent and a bit repetitive after a few rounds.

Thanks to its overall design and how well the individual parts (the various role powers, the king's ability to cancel cards, and the mechanic by which the following player is chosen) worked to make the gameplay seem like a fresh experience.  Palastgeflüster is a nice little surprise of a filler.  It is also one of those rare games where the first to play is considered as a disadvantage and where you'll find people often muttering not to be the one picked to go next.  Not terribly deep, but did gave us several laugh out loud moments.

Cute card game which is a little hard to grasp at first. The powers of the characters are interesting. The scoring seems a bit tacked on and I wish the designer had come up with something a bit more... elegant, I guess.

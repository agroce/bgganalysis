Incredible game that does a lot with extremely simple mechanics. Hand management, planning and tactical placement are crucial if you want to have any degree of success.

The cave goblins are just so much fun to play : swarm your opponent !

The guild dwarves are not my style, but breaking your opponent's walls is quite a kick in the nuts, and as such is very effective.

This is a good double pack of races to get, these bad boys are some pretty nasty heavy hitters.  The dwarves Champions are some of the strongest in the game are some real beef cakes.  Also they have a interesting strategy of destroying enemy walls with many cards playing into it.  However, this is more like a side bar shoot for the moon type deal, not the main plan.  Despite this Dwarves are tough.  The Cave Goblins are all about rushing and swarming with high numbers.  Many of the units get bonus movements allowing you to move more units on a turn.  Good for the swarm.  Also some interesting Champions, very diverse.  Good set.

The more offbeat of the two starter sets, this one appeals just a touch more than the Orcs and Elves to me. Two very different factions, Many would say assymetrical, but almost all games with players of similar skill end up with at least one player running out of cards - and often they end up in a nail-biting finish.

If you like tactical combat, you'll like this.

Summoner Wars is not revolutionary, nor is it terribly complex.  It's a simple little game that somehow defies being filler.  In many ways, this reminds me of a much simpler version of Manoeuvre.  As in that game, you have to manage your deck to move units around a limited square battlefield, and like that game what you can do during a turn is fairly limited.  It's basically a nicely themed abstract.  And yet the game is very exciting and tense, and the combination of decks used does make for very different games.  This one is good, fast fun, with just enough thinking to make it worthwhile.  I'll definitely be adding the new races to this once they're out.  It's a bargain at @$20 retail (and I got mine for $10 each, an absolute steal).

[i](I own it... I'm just indicating otherwise for "extended stats" purposes.)[/i]

I own the Master set, so my rating is based on how much these two races add to the diversity of options. 

With the Guild Dwarves and Cave Goblins, I'm a fan of both races. I don't care how strong they are--I'm more concerned with how unique each one feels.

With the dwarves, I love the option of going for the opponent's walls. Plus, the champions in the deck are both pretty tough and fun to bring onto the board.

With the goblins, they also have fun champions. However, they are a little less unique, as their "multiply and swarm" approach of low-cost units and allowing more than three attacks a turn can be seen in other decks. Nevertheless, this pair is a solid option to add to the Master Set.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Two great factions for the SW card game. The Guild Dwarves go for the throat by taking out walls, and the Cave Goblins attempt to overwhelm with sheer numbers and gang up tactics. These two factions added in with others breaths life into the possibilities.

Guild Dwarves are a really solid faction that excel in many areas. I find them a little boring though, mostly because they are so well-rounded. The Cave Goblins try to swarm the opponent with cheap (or even free!) units and several tricks to gain more activations per turn. This is a good starter, but Phoenix Elves VS Tundra Orcs is better in my opinion.

very effective battle card game. This should be right up my ally, deck construction but with a spatial battle game attached. The rules system is simple with units and event cards adding a wide variety of simple evocative chrome, lots of risk reward and internal power struggle systems between the players. However finding other opponents who will really get in to it....

It's easy to learn and teach.  Very strategic.  It's an amazing amount of fun for a low price point.  I wanted to start with this set before committing to the master set.  The thing I love is that these factions just add to the master set if I buy it later.  I would complain about the paper board but it wasn't really that bad and it won't matter once I upgrade to the master set.  I'll still have these two great factions that were well worth the money.  Great purchase.

Guild Dwarves were my favorite faction to play, with their ranged units getting stronger when within melee range.  They also have decent common units that freeze opponents into place which can be good for setting up traps and protecting units.  Didn't overly like Engineers, but very useful against Tundra Orcs weak ice walls.

Goblins are interesting.  I find that they are much more dependent on the luck of the draw of the events.  If you can get multiple events that have synergy, you can really put the hurt on your opponent.  Sadly, if you don't get the good draws, you units are weak and easily killed leaving you without a good chance at victory.

Summoner Wars is a delightful mesh of a traditional fantasy card game and chess, with ample strategy and just enough of a luck element to keep things interesting.  It's amazing that there are so many factions that all play quite differently from one another, and yet they're all mostly balanced.

The two factions included in this box, the Guild Dwarves and Cave Goblins, are not quite as suited for beginners as the Tundra Orcs or Phoenix Elves, but they are, in my opinion, much more interesting.

A well designed combination of a tactical miniatures game and a ccg-style card game.  The magic pile is a clever mechanic for resourcing the spell casting.  The game plays fast and furious.  Each side is different tactically, but the game remains balanced.  The paper map won't lay flat, but I got the mounted map board to fix that.  The best "indy" game I have played yet and the best new small game of 2010!

Guild Dwarves are hearty and can take lots of punishment. Baldar, the hero who only takes damage when an opponent rolls all hits is probably the strongest hero in the deck. Oh, and there's a little fella with an area-of-effect attack. When he's modified with the special ability card that doubles damage, he becomes a hellion.

Guild Dwarves are amazing. Their champions are so much fun to play. Unfortunately, like all of the Magic Drain decks, the game can come to a screeching halt. But that is a part of this game that you have to come to terms with.

Defenders are one of the most interesting common units. I love units that create clever ways to influence the spacial element of the game (Benders do this the best).

Cave Goblins...maybe my least favorite army. So discombobulating to play with. Thematically appropriate, so I understand the beauty of its design. I just don't like playing with them (and I always love playing against them). Part of it is that I think they are weak. Should try some deckbuilding with them.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2012)

As I really like Summoner Wars, it is no surprise I like this standalone/expansion game. Here comes my usual rant about the game, the art is regular, the cardstock quality is also regular, the cards mark easily and you need to sleeve them ASAP. I also dislike the paper map that comes with the game, its only advantage over the mounted one, is the portability. I already bought two Deluxe maps so we can play 2 games at the same time.

I have played a lot against the Guild Dwarves, they are a very solid faction and it is always hard to beat them. They play pretty straightforward. I have played the Cave Goblins only a handful of times and I’m still not sure how powerful they are. They seem very dangerous with their swarming abilities, but most often the player who has them lose the game. It seems they are a lot harder to master than the Dwarves :D.

The game has some controllable luck (dice and the order cards come to your hand) However the better player almost always win, so the luck doesn’t bother me.

I want to explore a lot more the Cave Goblins Faction. This is a must for any Summoner Wars fan.

The goblins have indeed become a very interesting faction to play with. They are hard to master but are a lot stronger than I initially suspected. 

I love the Summonner Wars universe and now I have bought everything I could for the game.

On 2009 they released both starter sets, this one and  Phoenix Elves vs Tundra Orcs. I chose the latter one as my favorite game of the year because: 1. I think it was released first. 2. The Tundra Orcs are my current favorite SW faction to play with. 

This is a game I expect to play for years to come. I just love it.

I have all of the currently available factions, and it still doesn't feel like enough. But in a good way. For your first set I'd say this one is just as good as Phoenix Elves vs. Tundra Orcs.

The best game I played so far. I think that it will stay in my top 10 forever, probably in top 5 as well.
I'm not a big fan of Cave Goblins though. I think they are overpowered. If you are starting with Summoner Wars buy Elves-Orcs starter set.

2014-03-19 I still don't like Cave Goblins, but recently I crushed them with Benders, so maybe they are not so overpowered after all!

The Mountains of Sorrow are aptly named, for they have been the site of the unending clash between Goblin and Dwarf. The Cave Goblins seek merely to throw themselves upon any foe with the will to fight. The Guild Dwarves sit in their mountain halls, jealously guarding their ancient riches. But with the discovery of the Summoning Stones comes a new kind of combat, and now these two great races will help set off the War for Itharia.

After the first reading of the rulebook I wasn't expecting much. I was really surprised how different the factions play and how clever this 'miniature' game really is. It's very rules light, but still offers lots of interesting tactical choices. The only downside I can think of is the annoying paper map.

The Dwarves are pretty tough and can demolish the important walls. On the other hand, the Goblins are highly mobile, very cheap to summon and dangerous in larger numbers.

The two factions are good and also a good match for each other. I like playing both and have no particular preference between them. I'd take the undead guys over either of them, however.

This is one of those games that gets a bonus point for being so simple to get into, set up and play. And with the availability of so many factions, there's no Earthly reason you won't get your money's worth from this game.

The only downside to this, really, is the crappy board that comes with it. Yeah, you can put Plexiglass over it, or you can store it flat, but still, with all those folds, it's nigh impossible to play with the board as delivered.

Once the master set arrives with the mounted board and the additional factions, this will be an even better game. I'm assuming all the faction decks will fit in the master set box.

(This is the only version I've played so ...) A nice 2 player game of attack, attack, attack. Draw units (cards) from your deck, add some units to the board if you have enough "summoning points" (ie kills you've made on previous turns plus cards you've put aside), move 3 units up to 2 spaces each, make attacks with any 3 units within range (some must be adjacent, archers can attack up to 3 spaces away), roll 3's for hits (with modifiers), add wound markers if their life points haven't run out. First to kill the big daddy up the back wins. As you'd expect, you have constant choices on what type of units to summon to the board, from the cheap short-life units to the more expensive, good-luck-killing-this type of unit. There's some event cards in each deck, and each unit has a special type of power, so knowing your deck well will help towards doing well, but there's only 5 or so types of units, plus some event types, so it's not overwhelming to learn. Waiting and generating co-ordinated attacks or defenses to the best advantage of your special powers seems key. The asynchronicity between decks is appealing, as is the quick game play and the constant choices. Lots of luck along the way but that's fine in this presentation and this length.

The Guild Dwarves offer good area control options and are especially effective at destroying walls.  This faction is very well balanced and excellent for new players.

One of the two small (original) starter sets for Summoner Wars. These are two interesting factions.

The Cave Goblins are built upon a strategy of swarming and overwhelming the enemy. They have a way of getting extra attacks each turn, and cheap units to summon, but those units are very brittle too and easily killed. You have to be careful not to give your opponent too much magic this way.

The Guild Dwarves have the ability to limit their opponent's summoning, by simply destroying his walls and pinning his units into place with their Guardians.

An immensely fun though admittedly flawed experience. Both races are wildly unbalanced - some characters are despairingly weak and others are horribly over-powered... and the same can be said for the event cards as well. Nevertheless, the actually gameplay itself - the core, the meat of the game - is fantastic and addictive. Simple yet elegant. It is open to many strategies and tactics. I do wish the battle system wasn't so luck-dependent, but the game is short and simple enough for it to feel acceptable. I am interested if expansions fix the balancing issues...

[b]Edit (12/2016):[/b] After over 5 years with the game, my concerns with it being unbalanced were unfounded. Great game.

My second SW set I've played. I was initially underwhelmed as I'm not fan of swarming strategies though Elves/Orcs were cool. Yet it's an interesting match up, even more than the first base set. Subtle strategies slowly shine through.

Dwarves have plenty of tactical possibilities with their defenders and the their wall destroying capabilities. Goblins on the other hand are an attacking swarm, yet there's some skill required to make most of them.

This starter set I like less rispect the other starter set, and here because:

Cave Goblins: They are one faction much hard to play, saw that in this game one great number of troops can are complicated to play (you can move, and attack, just with three units, save the special power of units and event cards)... but the summoner have one ability much strong.

Guild Dwarves: This is one faction rather anonymous. There are many abilities that destroy the walls enemy... with great pain for the swamp orcs...

The first thing I'll mention on these is that I love how the traditional outlook of these races are used quite differently in the game.  Sure, the goblins stick pretty close to the "rushing, sneaking goblins" that we usually see, but those armies in other games usually get squashed to bits.  In SW, the goblins are a blast to play and they do quite well.  The Dwarves focus on destroying walls and they have plenty of heavy hitters and good shields to do it.  The distinct feel of both armies is terrific and there's so many different strategies to use when combined with the reinforcement deck.  The best of the two starter packs, by far. Logging my plays under main heading Summoner Wars.

Summoner Wars is my favorite board/card game of all time. It's easy to learn, teach, and play, and there's phenomenal depth there for anyone who wants to become a master. The luck element can be strong at times, but there are plenty of ways to mitigate it, and it ultimately only makes this wonderful game even more thrilling.

I've written about SW a few times, and will continue to do so in the future: http://spacebiff.com/tag/summoner-wars/

This set contains two of the most basic Summoner Wars factions, and is a good entry point into the series.

The GUILD DWARVES are one of the game's two easiest factions to learn. They focus on good tough units that ably defend their summoner, and on abilities and troops that let them tear down their opponents' Walls, thus blocking their ability to summon. In fact, while they don't have the best units in the game, they have very few weaknesses, so they're probably one of the best factions to give to new players.

The CAVE GOBLINS require a bit more finesse, but are still interesting and competitive. They have lots of troops that cost nothing to summon, so they can crowd the board with loads of weak goblins, then use their great event cards to make horde attacks or become nearly invincible for a turn or make additional moves. This is a slightly more advanced faction, but with some practice they're fully competitive.

I haven't played enough of either faction to see how well balanced they might be, but I've had a blast just playing the game. The design seems a little fiddly at first, but it comes together well, and has enough other stuff going on throughout the game to keep it from feeling like a Chess knockoff. It's also rather addictive, which isn't a bad quality to have. Not at all.

I would like to love this game ... but I don't play it often enough to know the 2 armies well.
I have yet to try to use the reinforcements (?) instead of the pre-constructed army.

With regular plays, it could rise up to 7,5.

I bought a premium board to play this on, as I cannot see myself even trying it on the paper board. Summoner Wars is a great game. Sure it's random, but it's good quick fun. I would enjoy both exploring each faction in depth, as well as trying just about every darn new expansion that comes out.  :)

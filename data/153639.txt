"Deckbuilder" with a very slow ramp.  The deckbuilding aspect isn't strong, since there aren't as many purchases made.  Money is scarce, so every purchase decisions really counts.  The attack/defense mechanic reminds me of the Naval War card game family.

A nice, simple Deck-Builder with the cool theme of Steampunk supervillains battling each other for supremacy over the skies. No current plans for more characters with an expansion.

A decent deckbuilder, but it's greatest strength is probably the unusual theme. The pacing is off and the player interaction isn't that compelling.

Very enjoyable game. I'm a fan of deckbuilders, and this one has enough variations to set it apart (money gets discarded when you use it, purged cards count as victory points). Each of you play as a character but character-specific strategy really doesn't come into play until you buy your own Experimental Zeppelin (which can only be bought by the character named on the card). 

Edit: My game group loves it! One of the guys at my group is looking to buy it, and the guy who runs it is very interested in his own copy as well. And this is only after bringing it three times! It's definitely a game that people are enjoying and is absolutely worth getting.

Only played with 2 players. Pretty solid little deckbuilder. Very thematic. Took some time to get a handle on and figure out a good strategy for the deck. Figuring out the set-up from the rulebook was the biggest barrier to start playing. Once you get it set up though it makes sense.

Great Fun! A real pleasure! This game hits me just right! Light mini-deck-builder take-that game with Steam-Punk-Zeppelin theme! I love it! Much more than a sum of it's parts, which is funny to me here because many of these parts in any other game would make that game horrible for me.

Thank You, Anthony Rocano for recommending this.

I now am looking forward more to what the designer will do with the Dresden Files game.

I have not tried the expansions, yet.

(played from Kickstarter PNP) Nice deck builder variant with a fun theme.  The design makes it play more quickly than many deck-builders, and allows for card culling that does not slow the game down.  Instead of cards that give you extra actions on a turn, you get as many action plays as you have zeppelins in your armada (played to the table in front of you).  Opponents can attack the zeppelins, and get points for succeeding, making for more direct player interaction than in many deck-builders.  Highly recommended.

Not so much a deckbuilder, and moreso a game wherein you have a deck, and you occasionally buy cards that go into your deck. And then if you're lucky you eventually draw them. You buy them moreso for the VP than the actual cards. Slow, clunky, not worth playing again, but not bad.

I am surprised at how much I liked this game. It is now added to my carrying box of games because it is so portable, handles up to 4 people, and is a clever deck builder(it also does not hurt that I like the Spirit of the Century RPG). We will get more replay-ability with the expatiation.

the direct attacks are well done -- they are not a big setback and are mostly opportunistic in order to earn points.  So, it makes aggression work multi-player.  The game may take a bit too long for what it is, but maybe it speeds up with more plays.  Overall, I like it.

I will freely admit that half a point to a point of my rating completely comes from the theme. This game does implement the theme well. It is an extremely unique and fun game as well. This game feels much different than any other deck building game, and the small card count means that every card (especially every buy) is important. There is a decent amount of strategy and we were surprised by all of the different ways to approach the game. There is some randomness that might annoy some, but as the game progresses it is possible to mitigate some of this luck..

I've played this since it was a prototype & it's an enjoyable, innovative, fast-playing deckbuilding. Now that I've seen the fully-produced version with great Evil Hat art & graphic design, I'm even more impressed, because it's a beautiful well-themed game too.

This is a fresh take on the deck building genre. Cards you want May be taken to be used as points. Cards are discarded only if you buy that type of card. You can only play cards if you have the zeppelins to play them on. Attacking players to gain more actions. It's great.

Limited scope deck-builder. Quick build-up in your armada leads to lots of action, but that means lots of downtime, too. Interesting deck-thinning mechanic is easy to forget. Interaction at good level. More random than even the average DB.  Main problem, though, is the card variety is just not there - though there is one expansion (but a small one).

A steam-punk, deck-building strategy game with a little bit of take-that. The theme is super cool and unique, and I like that its deck-building mechanics are little different than other games. Takes a few rounds to get the handle on your strategy, but after that it is very enjoyable. Turns can be long if you have friends who take a while to think about what they're going to do.

This one is a bit strange - the difference of the proponents only show up if you happen to buy your individual zeppelin or weapon. And the deck building works very different, too - purging is there when you buy, buys go to your hand directly and you keep your hand for next turn if you want. This makes it much more strategic. Buy stacks behave like with epic Thunderstone, so you have both a dynamic shopping, but still almost always something you can buy - but money purges on buy directly, so even spending money is more strategic. All in all a very welcome different take on deck building. And I love the theme. Only downside might be the rather long play time. And that I probably won't ever get it to the table. Oh well. My box includes the three mini expansions I got.

Zeppelin attack checks all of my boxes in a way that gets me super hot and turned on.  I need to play it more before marrying it but the current score is solid.

For deckbuilding games, I found myself liking more of "clean designs" because they help me to control and understand the strategies how to build my deck --> generate the depth in the game. With this one, I felt there was too much unnecessary noise hindering the experience and reducing the strategies. There was quite a bit of luck involved too (which necessarily is not a bad thing imho). But anyways, otherwise it was OK experience.

This game is awesome! I had never played a Deck Build Game before, so I was nervous going in. The game was very simple to set up, very easy to learn, and very quick. I was able to teach my game group(all seasoned RPG players) and work group(who have never really touched RPG's or Deck Building Games) the game really quickly. We had a blast playing it into the night!

My only complaint about the game is that the rules book didn't, in my opinion of course, thoroughly explain some parts of the game as well as the Youtube video Evil Hat put up while the game was in it's Kickstarter Phase. I also wish there were a couple of Good Guy ships so that you could have 6+ player games. So I'm crossing my fingers for that in the next expansion!

The only other thing I will say is the game is 100x more awesome with the expansion and promo's. Atomic Warfare is crazy!! So if you pick this up, pick up the Expansion too!

What I love-
Building up your fleet of Zeppelins. Attacks can be blocked by defensive cards, and even when they get through, your zeppelin will be repaired and back in action within a few turns. The way money comes into your deck, into your hand, then back out, and tied to certain balanced events. 
Great, deck builder with conflict that does not devastate your opponent, but rather slows them down while gaining you victory points. 

What I Dislike-
Having my best zeppelin damaged and no longer able to use a card in my hand. (minor)

Enjoyed the deck building and combat.

Game length is a bit long especially if playing with players not used to figuring out card abilities on their own.

I think my rating will go up once I play it with my usual gaming group.

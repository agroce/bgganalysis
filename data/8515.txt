This is one of the best games I've ever played, it is fun to play, well balanced between the factions and it looks absolutley superb! It's also kind of hard to predict who will be the winner, since the scales might change in the last round, happened to me at several occasions.

Gorgeous components and miniatures. The manual is not very well written, but serves its purpose, and the rules themselves seem rather good. Has much more atmosphere than your regular fantasy dungeon games (and is of a considerably darker hue). 'Twill be a while until I have everything painted and ready.

Cry Havoc #3 is a mandatory "expansion", in my opinion, as it explains some very vague points in the manual.

RATING: N/A
This is in reality my ONLY board gaming IMPULSE buy! I am torn on the utility of the purchase as I have not so much as broken it out to look at laid out in front of me since the purchase! I read the rules and its fairly familiar territory for me, and the minis are fantastic. However I am just not sure how often if ever this will get played, I will refrain from a score just yet, I WILL play it before I even consider a sale/trade, there is a lot here and the components are top notch.

just an aside for me, if I can get a hold of some reasonable pre painted Rackham minis to play this with, it would hit the table at once! I know that is pretty shallow, but as you can probably tell I enjoy writing, and am no artist, so painting minis is just not something I will get around to...like ever. but what is here draws me in, and the boxes sit in my office not with my other games, and they taunt me, so it WILL get playtime, I'll score then!

Picked this up as an introduction to Rackham models, prior to getting into Confrontation 3rd Edition.  Had a few plays, I remember it being decent if not great.  The miniatures are top notch, and the rest of the components are also of very high quality.

I'll need to play it more in order to give it a rating.

Anyone who read the Rackham forums will know me as "Cage" so it's hardly surprising I rate this a 10. It's an awesome representation of man to man combat, in my 25 years of gaming this has been the most "pure fun" to play. If you like skirmish style games you must try this one.
Been playing it solidly for a year, probably racked up 100 games by now.

P.s. You can play all the included scenarios with the miniatures in the box

I think this game could be incredible, actually.  It's a hybrid (har har) of a skirmish-level miniatures game such as Space Hulk or even Doom and a dungeon crawl that has more atmosphere than just about any other board game on the market today thanks to efflusive narrative text, spectacular graphic presentation, and a rich and fairly original fantasy setting that pits megalomaniac necro-alchemist-scientists and their creations against good guys that are equal parts "Brotherhood of the Wolf" and Vampire Hunter D.  The rules are not nearly as confusing, incomplete, or poorly translated as many have suggested here- rather they're actually very simple, inobtrusive, and intuitive even if the presentation is somewhat nonlinear.  The skill system, which coordinates a statistic with various levels of mastery over certain types of actions, works very smoothly and the incorporation of wilfully restricted cardplay into action resolutions can make for some suprising turns of events.  I can't say enough about how awesome this game looks on the table and fortunately there is a rich game with lots of strategic possibility to back it up.  Unfortunately, it is a miniatures game which means, for me at least, hunks of much-to-fragile metal that look like Jackson Pollack paintings.  If the game had prepainted plastic minis like Heroscape or D&D Minis, I would be tempted to give this a 10.  It's just not part of the hobby for me.  There are some unfortunate quality control issues (missing miniature pieces) and I find it somewhat gauche that most of the scenarios that are included require the purchase of additional figurines (unless you proxy them with something else.  Hybrid is a great game, definitely not one for the El Grande crowd but I'd definitely say it's the best game of its type currently on the market.

RATING: 8
My favorite space-hulk like. Heavy background and top notch components. Once rules have been decrypted (the rulebook is really a mess), the game offers a great and tense experience. The main drawback of this base set is the lack of Scorpio creature types (only 2...) which limits the tactics and replayability. But if you had the expansion set, all the stuff you can find in Cry Havoc magazines and additional figs... the playing possibilities become huge ! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent tactical dungeon crawl, with some unique aspects. Beautiful miniatures and heavy with theme. Rules translation is quite bad, and contains a few errors. Some of the components also require "fixing", namely the activation counters. Sometimes our games tend to drag.

Excellent game and figures and components. Compared to similar games, it has a high level of re-playability due to optional rules from the magazine, and due to the plethora of miniatures available to be used.

The figures are excellent quality, and for a experienced model maker, these are simple enough to clean and put together.

The only thing that is a down side is the rule book is confused in organization, and the game is perhaps over designed, with cards filled with flavour text.

Very good miniatures game, reminiscent of Space Hulk. Jaw-dropping components make up for the horrendous train-wreck of a manual. Limited creature set narrows options, so this doesn't really allow for army-building the way other miniature games do (even boxed ones)--but the cards add a fun tactical element.

Rules are tough to get through (not the best translation and you'll want to check an FAQ since some important subtleties exist), but the game plays quickly and is quite a lot of fun.  There's a lot going on and some of the mechanics help a player who would otherwise be headed towards an early loss.  You don't need the expansion units or sets but some of them are pretty cool. (they add a lot of interesting special powers and effects)  Really a tactical game of small unit actions rather than a dungeon crawl.

  I like it more every time I play it, so that's a good thing...

After FINALLY getting an understanding of the rules and playing it 1 and a half times I was less than impressed. I can't believe any one who has played Space Hulk would find this better. I actually can't believe it gets compared to Space Hulk as there are few similarities. Worst rules interpretation ever, confusing is an understatement. Left me with no desire to play again.

Rackham is the world leader of quality control in miniatures.  Their atmosphere is great, and I love the passion that is evident even in the English translation of all text.

I haven't gotten to play yet, but only because I will feel guilty if we don't paint the minis first.  Of course, Rackham has such a high bar for paint job quality, that I had to subtract half a point for this being an exclusionary aspect to the game.

In all other respects, this is one of the best dungeon crawl games out there!

Not sure the price is completely justifiable but I have to admit I completely enjoyed the game enough to want to play multiple times in a row... and I'm infamous in my group for disliking miniature-table-top or scenario based games. Beautiful pieces and well thought out flavor text. Drips theme and is amazingly easy to play considering the complexity level.

This is an odd little French wargame.  Much like with Brotherhood of the Wolf, I felt that I was missing subtext in the world setting.  It boils down to two evenly matched but very disparate groups trying to achieve the scenario goal in a claustrophobic dungeon setting.

Hybrid is an excellent piece of tactical skirmish game coupled with a strong dungeon crawl aspect. The presentation is top notch, and the gameplay system makes for some very interesting choices (great force building component, interesting scenarios, and a very flexible combat system).

I've played through the base game campaign and nearly the whole expansion and I've had a ton of fun with this game. It has its drawbacks (such as poorly translated cards which can sometimes raise a few eyebrows regarding the rules), yet all in all its gameplay more than makes up for all the shortcomings.

Soaked in dark gothic fantasy theme. Beautiful board tiles and pieces. Lavish. Thats the word for it.

Before I give my praise to this game I would just like to say to those with doubts about the game or the rules...PLEASE take another look and search for  the updated rules translations.  When I first was introduced to the game, I was confused and quickly approached the corner of the room in a fetal position.  However, when I found a better english translation for the game on Rackham's Hybrid forums, I soon found that this is one of the best miniature-based board games ever.  The quality of the game boards, counters and miniatures are unmatched (even if you leave the miniatures in there naked metal form). The price is a little steep, but you do get your money's worth (Just think, for $80 you can almost get 500 points of warhammer 40k! WHoo Hoo!).  Also, with a little web-based effort, you can find over 70 challenging and entertaining "Approved" missions. For those who like "Space Hulk," I greatly recommend this game.  If the miniatures and game board doesn't grab you, the dark and tragic fluff will!

An interesting game of tactical underground combat, inviting difficult decisions and, at times but not always, leading to tense plays. 

Rackham miniatures are the best I've ever seen, and the game used to offer (when in print) good value for money on that side. In fact the whole artwork, while sort of patchy, is always consistent with the dark backdrop on which the game is set.

Unfortunately, and although the main mechanics do work relatively well, this game was not properly developed: even aside from the fuzzy translation, the text on cards is prone to ambiguities and one is under the impression that the implementation of cards and mastery levels might have been improved considerably.

I like the Aarklash-background from Confrontation, and Hybrid does not only use this amazing background story, but also Rackham's beautiful metal miniatures.
Hybrid is a great 2-player skirmish game, that might not be among the fast-paced ones, but certainly among the tactically engaging ones.
The game is overflowing with flavour text. Most of the game cards come with a lot of background text that might (but not must) be read to add more story and a feel for the game's background.
As was typical for Rackham, not only the miniatures look very nice, also the overall artwork of the game board sections and terrain markers is amazing.

I don't think this is a problem of the mechanics, once learnt, they run very smoothly indeed and the addition of the variuos cards makes every game that little bit diffrent, I think its more that the rules are lost in the translation from french to english.Another thing I like about this game is the level of support it gets, with new troop types and missions on a (more or less) monthy basis. A very Good game to get into if you like tactical board games.tj -x-

After three plays, I must confess that I am quite disappointed with this game. It is very expensive (especially considering you NEED the expansion and some of the game magazines to play this game properly), the manual and cards (and there are a lot of them) are VERY poorly translated from French, en not all of the components in the box are of the same quality as the excellent miniatures. Moreover, the game is no less dice-driven than your average GW miniature game (not that that is necessarily a bad thing). Finally, adding miniatures to the game is outrageously expensive.Oh well, I will certainly give this another shot (thanks to the help of some excellent Hybrid forums --- I do not seem to be the only one struggling with the rules and cards), but found my first few games pretty tiresome. If you are interested in games of this ilk, try Space Hulk instead.

The quality, the depth, the quality, The mini's, the quality, the board, the quality and it plays well too!

Lovely miniatures, great production values, poor proof reading. This is annoying with some of the scenarios. A good cross-over fantasy miniatures /boardgame.

Incredible looking miniatures from this game by Rackham (known for outstanding minis).  This game looks cool, but since I picked up Space Hulk it is no longer a must have.

At face value sounds a bit pricey but wait till you open the box....the components along deserves an 11! have you ever encountered terrain plates and counters as thick? The print quality? Super. Artwork, graphic design and concept? Games workshop will have a run for their money...and looks like Rackham will win. How does it play? Went through 4 scenarios and the games pretty much balanced with lots of option to take (that more or less balances out the luck factor).....looking forward to the sequel Nemesis :)

An excellent dungeon / skirmish game. Beautiful minis, that do require some assembly however. The complexity is well above that of similar Space Hulk, with a hefty dose of more flavour, randomness (through cards) and tactical thinking. Highly replayable and expandable (through seperately available minis and the expansion Nemesis). Love it!

This is another beautiful game from Rackham with great looking miniatures and beautiful board peices.  My problem with the game is its overly complex.  A player has way too many types of cards he has to keep track of and the game seems to take to long for what it is.  Still... its actually my favorite of the Rackham games to date.  Hopefully the quality of the rules will start matching the quality of the miniatures one of these days.

Made by Rackham and it's a sorta space hulk-ish sorta dungeon crawler ish squad level tactical game between griffon guys and dirz guys.  The rule translation is pretty rough but there are tons of good play guides.  I want to try this and the expansion out sometime because the minis and the boards are fantastic.

A friend of mine painted the mini's, and boy do the Scorpion troops look horrible (in a good way of course ;))

First play took some time to figure out the flow.
Thanks to UniversalHead's Rules summary everything went pretty well. 

Pretty fun and tense game.
Also the most visually pleasing game I have thus far (but only if you's good at painting mini's or know someone who does).

Will have to try the next scenario's.

Also got Cry Havoc magazine's 2-17, together with the Reversible Gaming Tiles sets and the heaps of scenario's I'll have plenty of interesting experiments with Dirz creatures...

Setup is a bit long, maybe I'll have to find a better way to store all the bits ;p.

Hybrid is my newest acquaintance in the world of dungeon crawling, and a good acquaintance it is. This game have lots of potential. And I think that the world Confrontation is chewing its way into one of my favourite fantasy settings.

The poor English translations on the cards can lead to some heated disagreements about their meaning - at least, that was my experience.  Since arguing over poorly-translated rules is not my idea of fun, neither is Hybrid.

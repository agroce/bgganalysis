RATING: 5
average kid game. Each player choose their action at the same time, and the outcome of your choice largely depends on others' actions. So luck is significant here, but that is the source of fun in this little game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm commenting on this based on the fact that it is a family game - meant to be played together by adults and kids aged about 7 upwards.  As such, it works very well.  OK, so there is simultaneous selection of actions, but here that's apt - it increases the tension and the feeling of bluffing and second-guessing that is so enjoyable.  Besides, you can either try to remember what others have played - thus increasing your options, or you can agree that all played cards remain visible to help you with tactics. 

Finding small rocks in a game is a bit odd and they don't half add to the weight of the box for postage purposes, but they are a lot of fun, even if Pedro has a job getting his leg over as a result.

I wouldn't say that it was quite as good as Survive or Tonga Bonga, which are kind of similar in theme if not scope, but it's certainly a good game to have with junior aged children.

after i looked at the rules linked in the general forum, i wasn't sure what i was in for on bsw.  i was surprised.  i played with 5 or 6 players, and i think i would like it with less.  i was surprised at how fun it was though, tension with no pain.  i like that there is only 1 loser and everyone else wins too.  i've played this face to face some since then, and the magic has worn fairly thin.

Played with 5,  and yes,  it's very chaotic.  There is definitely some fun,  but only in seeing which person randomly heads off in the wrong direction!  Probably a decent party game.

Largely a guessing game, with a memory element.  Not a great combination for me.  The game produces one loser and everyone else is a winner.  Surely there could have been a better solution.

Very exciting game, especially with 6 players. You never know, what the others are doing and this knowledge of not knowing can be really agonizing. Works fine with 6 and also good to play with family because of the high fun-factor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Seems like it might be an entertaining game to play with kids, but in the end this random guessing game is just average in enjoyment.  If you have a 5-6 players it does the beer-and-pretzels job well enough, but if "simultaneous action selection" and paper-light strategy is your thing you are far better off with the much superior "Diamant" instead.  This is just ok.

Not my cup of tea at all - it looks quite cute, although the Piranhas look more like crabs to me. Theme is just daft (and paper thin).

Game play is very random - I played by just flipping cards from my deck without looking at them first, and I was the most successful in the game (no lives lost). The game only has one loser too, which seems a bit odd.

Possibly there is more control and game with 3 players (I played with 4), but I have no desire to try it again.

Good times.  I'd like to play it with more people.  The game and the components are all great.  It actually comes with a bag of rocks in which you move Pedro around on.  The element of one person losing and everyone else winning is unique and adds a lot of fun.

RATING: 5
Second-guessing your opponents' moves is always kind of fun in most games, but when the entire game is based around doing that, it gets pretty boring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Another cute filler, but it contains doublethink which I'm never a huge fan of.  If you're last in turn order, try to guess what everyone else will do and hope you guessed right.  If you're first in turn order, try to guess what everyone will think you'll do, and do something different to screw them over.  Still, it's a cute little game that I wouldn't mind pulling out from time to time.

This is a fun game of second-guessing.  We play it 2-player.  (In each turn, the starting player goes 1st and 3rd, with the other player going once in-between.)  The wooden piranhas and Pedro figure are quite nice.  This is perfect when you don't have long to play and want something light.  The theme is silly, and the box art alone always makes me smile.

Oh no!  Pedro fell in the water...completely stupid game where you're at the mercy of what other players do.  It's really quite fun with gamers who aren't bent on showing how "hardcore" they are to each other.  There is a slight decision making element but never expect it to go your way!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Very good fast and easy game. Ideal to present something unusual to non-gamers. Simple rules, nice components (but some stones are too big to fit under pedro). Strange winning conditions: only one person is declared the loser, everybody else wins.

Group think game, nice enough. We got canny, so the later games took a long time to finish, with the board filling up with stones. Completely irrelevant theme, why is Pedro walking off the island, if reaching the side is a losing condition? Nice white stones, but losts of too big and too small ones. Some sieving would be good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played 2 times. On one hand it's a fun little game that almost deserves an 8 for sheer fun-factor. On the other hand, the graphics are both good and bad. Nice stones, but the board is very dull and the "compass cards" are a dumb idea. (Why not print them onto the board? The graphic implementation is better on BSW than in the game!) Still much fun for more players. A rare 6p funfest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Funny how your feelings for the poor Pedro vary on who's turn it is.  You want to hold the low movement cards for those unfortunate moments where you are down to no rocks and everyone is maneuvering to the edge or to the waiting jaws of the pesky piranhas.  And also to acquire more rocks for the next round.  Overall a nice take on the simultaneous movement genre which I enjoy for that peculiar moment when everyone secretly selects their cards with nothing to go by but their flawless ability to read their opponents' minds.  Made my daughters laugh so it has to be something.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
(Played online on BSW) Piranha Pedro is a silly little game where 2-6 players move a sombrero-headed fellow around with cards played simultaneously. Yep, it's the Adel Verpflichtet blind action mechanism. It's ok, this is supposedly a family game (your kids will enjoy feeding Pedro to the fishies), so the multiplayer blind chaos is tolerable to that audience. It's sorta funny seeing (imagining?) Pedro's flesh being consumed by hungry carnivorous fishes, but I would have serious doubts about the shelf life of this game for any audience. (However, not being a member of this target audience, I could be mistaken. Still, after three online plays, I think I'm done with it.) And by the way, in this game, ONE player LOSES, and everyone else wins. Sure, single out the victim of the whole chaotic mess. It's not like he/she had any control over it. I hope the price point of the Goldseiber Big Box (this is a big box game? could be the real stones they're giving you for your money...) isn't too high, because you're not getting much game in it.

Similar story with this one as with Dragon Delta however, I feel the latter is the much superior game.  The aesthetic appeal of Piranha Pedro is top notch, but the game fails to be as colourful.  There is nothing so terrible here but then there is nothing so wonderful either.  

UPDATE: Pedro should fear dust bunnies more than piranhas on my shelf.  I am lowering this title to a four, and apologize for comparisons between this and Dragon Delta.  Aside from simultaneous action selection the two are worlds apart.

UPDATE: Not just dust bunnies, but falling numbers is another thing Pedro should fear.  Rating now a 3.

light and silly.  simultaneous action selection.  actions move pedro 1-3 spaces in one of 4 directions on grid.  if you go over water, have to place one of the rocks (and they're real rocks, like what you might have in your driveway, or more likely in your landscaping.) along the path he walked in the water.  If you send him off the board, he lands on a piranha, or you can't put a rock under his feet, the round ends and you take a piranha off the board.  game ends when someone takes a second piranha.

A silly hidden movement game about moving a character around an island and placing stepping stones (from a limited supply) whenever he falls in the water.

A fantastic outguessing game.  It is one of the few games that allows you to either simply play your own defensive game, or alternatively actively attempt to screw over the guy who plays after you.  The mechanic of giving you stones based on how much risk you were willing to take in the previous round is excellent.  Not much variety in the game however - most games are similar.

I cannot, for the life of me, understand where the pleasure is in Piranha Pedro. I usually enjoy luck in games but there has to be a limit! This game is almost completely random!

There is alot of blind-luck in the card play, and unless you are first or second in the round, there is no true way to strategize.

Might make a good kid's game. Not quite sure that it's worth my playtime though -- there are, effectively, no decisions to be made (unless you are the first player) as there is nothing that can be deduced or strategized and therefore your actions are, in the end, completely random.

Oh Pedro, you got yourself into another encurtido!  Currently my favourite "programmed-moves" games after Himalaya.  Keeping the played cards open turns it into less of a guessing game & adds a bit more tactics.  I like how quickly it plays, unlike Dragon Delta, which is also a good game but often overstays it's welcome. I hope to see Pedro again in future games.

RATING: N/A
All players simultaneously pick a card and in order are played, moving Pedro around. If your card makes him go into water, you play down a rock for him to walk on. If you can't, or if he lands on a piranha, the hand is over and the loser scores points.

The game ends when someone gets 2 points (ie is eaten by piranhas twice). Therefore, 1 loser, many winners.

Rate this higher than usual perhaps due to the fun factor.  Love the guess work and the more the merrier with this game as it just gets harder to outguess the group!  Fun, Fun, Fun...we love this game and suspect to play more and more.

RATING: 6.5
This is one of the best games ever made. With 3  players, it is a quick fun filler, with humourous art and lots of skill and bluffing. Although some of the skill and bluffing goes away once you get to five and six players, the game is amazing. With two players, the game is wildly strategic. Two players make this game the top bluffing game on BGG. And it is not just bluffing, you are conserving your hand. A huge amount of strategies exist in this game. Please, do yourself a favour and play this. Now. Immediately.

September 15th, 2007:
It's been a hard decision.

I really like Piranha Pedro, and for a long time, I would rant and rave about how amazing it was. But the fact is - I just don't want to play it as much anymore. It can get - gasp - boring. And that is why..

Lowered from 10 to 9.

First impression: Fun theme. Simultaneous card playing makes it chaotic in nature but it is fun to play and short enough so chaos doesn't bother. Maybe if you'd play a lot with same people you'd start to able to outguess your righthand neighbour's thoughts..

RATING: 7
It's pretty random (especially with more players), there's little control, there's no absolute winner (being one loser and everyone else wins) ... but it's fun! Pick a movement card (1, 2, 3 spaces; east, sth, west, nth) and then see, by the time it gets around to your turn, whether you get to go on the island and/or onto already placed stones (that's good) or whether you're somewhere unexpected and you have to give up your precious stones and place them in the sea to have somewhere to go safely. If you run out of stones or move off the board or into a "piranha" spot, you're dead. Two deads and you're the loser. The fun is in trying to predict where the players before you will go, and if you're going first, trying to go somewhere others won't predict so as to get them into more stone trouble than yourself. It's short, got good groan / relief factor, it passes the time pleasantly, at the end you have the cheer of everyone winning (bar one). Just don't expect anything else or more.

Might be ok for a young kids game and it's not a bad on BSW when you have nothing better to do.  However, in live play I would rather pull out Emerald if I'm looking for something quick
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
What a cool little game! Great idea to include actual stones in the game as playing pieces. Although visually clearly targeted at younger players, if played by a group of veteran players, this can make for a seriously "screw-you" game that ends with everyone winning on the expenses of the first player to collect two piranhas, thus loosing the game.

Very light hearted 30-minutes-fun-fest.

- Very easy to learn, even easier to teach and makes for a quick game. Nice and simple.

A board game that's more like a party game.  Plays up to 6 players and the more the better.  Pedro is trapped on this island and dies if he drowns in the water or gets eaten by a piranha.  Players all place a card face down, then the starting player places his face up and moves Pedro according to the card he played.  If Pedro moves over water, the player must place one of his stones on the water so Pedro can stand, this stone remains for the game and can be used by other players.  When Pedro dies, everyone removes all the stones they have and gets new ones depending on which cards you have in your hand.  If you use all your "good" cards during the round, you won't get as many stones back.  If you use your "bad" cards and take risks, you'll get more stones.  Great game, lots of fun, lots of yelling/cursing/moaning ..highly recommended.

Com o tabuleiro minimalista, peçonas grossas de madeira e as pedrinhas de verdade, o jogo é tão bonito quanto divertido (e é divertido pra caramba). Pedro está num banco de areia no meio do Amazonas, cercado de piranhas. Quem deixar ele morrer perde. Todos escolhem simultaneamente uma carta de movimento e cada um, na ordem do turno, move o Pedro de acordo com sua carta. É meio como uma batata quente, fatalmente ele vai morrer. Jogamos três partidas seguidas, e teria jogado mais se não estivesse tão tarde.

A fun, light game, and a nice mix of board-game and card game.  The fact that you have to outguess your fellow players, and all cards are played up simultaneously is a nice way to enjoy it.  Just as fun on BSW as on a gameboard.

RATING: 5
A very light game that probably works best in its BSW implementation that takes care of all the bookkeeping keeping the game pace up.  But something to be said for playing face to face just to get the groans when plans go awry.  Not to be taken seriously in any way shape or form.  Just random fun where everyone wins, but the one loser.

This is a funny filler to play once in a while.  Pedro, a poor guy, is stucked on an island.  Players play cards secretly to take Pedro to a walk and then reveal them in order of turn.  The one who let Pedro jump into the water and feed the piranhas looses the round.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun fun silly programmed action game where players try to prevent Pedro from drowing or being eaten by Pirahnas.

It plays quick and there's some room for double guessing. It looks really nice and is perfect to start or end a games night. Plays 6 players too!
The stones are nice and heavy. However, the quality of this Goldseiber game is a little lower than usual. The board has an American Valley (Strange since it's a German made game) and the box cover is poorly pasted on.

RATING: 6
An amusing game on BSW and still lots of fun in person, PP is a great kid's game that has some nice mechanics in it, too (like the way stones are connected to the cards and what you play the next turn - and short turns alternating with long ones as a result). A winner on charm and quick play - plus, how many other multi-player games let everyone but one player win?

RATING: 7.5
At first I thought this just to be a cute light filler, but nothing of any significance.  I played it a few times on BSW and disregarded it.  No one had it and I didn't own a copy so I ended up forgeting about it, considering it just duping the mechanics that I have in other games (Simultaneous action).  I just looked at Dragon Delta as the better game.

After time has passed I realized that the worm had sunk into my brain.  I kept having the yen to play Piranha Pedro, but continue to rely on my initial opinion of indifference to counter my spending.

Well I gave in and bought it.  I'm glad I did.  I mean it is light and random, but at the end of the day it is fun.  

I've found that it is a vastly superior game played in person, and while the BSW interface works, much of the fun interaction is stipped out. I also like to play with all the discards face up.

Perhaps I'm in the minority, but I like the fact that there is only one loser. This makes the game quick and solves player elimination. Plus, everyone can point fingers and laugh at the loser.

I still can't believe the game comes with a bag of rocks.

I used to rate this an 8 and I would always make the mistake of pulling this out to introduce to non-gamers, but I have found that it is very hit-or-miss with people.  

Some really get it and enjoy the double-think.  Others play it very methodically and only play the safest card. They tend to lose, but think it was just bad luck and never understand that they were being very predictable.

I have also found out that this is not a good children's game.  Kids are, by and large, very risk averse, so they always fall into the predictable camp.

So, despite the simple rules, short play time and silly/fun theme I think this is only a gamers game.

Still I like it and it is a lot of fun with punchy or inebriated gamers.

Even if I didn't like it I couldn't bring myself to get rid of a game that has two pounds of rocks for components.

By the way, I replaced the white aquarium rocks that came with the original game with the polished decorative rocks one can buy at a dollar store.  These look better and they don't get that white dust all over.

Of course I kept the aquarium rocks because these are the original components.  Now the game weighs 37 pounds.  




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 1

First Impression:

Poor Pedro.. A very light game, that wastes one of my favorite mechanics, simultaneous action selection.

The game is light, and plays smoothly. There is some thinking to be done, due to the sim.act.selection, as you try to trap your opponents.

If played with 3-4 the game quickly gets chaotic, while player elimination is an inexpusable problem for such a light game. There is luck of the draw, as there are clearly better cards (move less or keep for more stones) to draw, but then again you will rarely be restricted by them. The theme is childish, but the gameplay is not.

In the end, I can't really recommend this game for anyone. It's too light for gamers, and player elimination kills it for pretty much any other group.

I was pleasantly surprised by Piranha Pedro.  I've played it some online at BrettspielWelt, but I like it a lot more in person because the game boils down to bluffing.  It would probably get too chaotic with too many players, but with two or three players it works well as an interesting exercise in trying to outguess your opponents.  Not a lot of strategy, but fun nonetheless.

Funny filler that is perfect to play as the last game of the evening, as the explanation of the rules can be done in two minutes and you do not need to concentrate very hard while playing. Probably best with 4 players...did not like it very much with six, as you spend more time taking stones than playing cards. People are easily motivated to play when you show them the box and the components, and they cannot help giggling when someone reveals a disastrous move. Could recommend it, even though I am not wild about the fact that the game ends with someone losing instead of winning.

Played once face-to-face, and several times on BSW. A very easy game, quite uncontrollable with lots of players. Bluffing and tricking the player after you is quite enjoyable, but there is not much more in the game, and I will probably not bother playing it again face-to-face, nor too often on BSW.

Cute, very light, very fast simultaneous action/reveal card. End of turn order is all chaos, no control. Only one game played, which lasted about 2 minutes. The 3rd player in turn order lost, as she went 3rd during the first round, triggering the end of the round when she went off the board, and 2nd during the next round, running off the board again after my move put her on the edge. Nasty.

There are two versions of this game. One is German, the other French. Besides the language, the big difference is that the German games comes with a board, while the French edition doesn’t. Nice touch of the German edition, is when the you open the box, there are real stones inside. Over 100 small stones. While this is a kids game, it doesn’t mean it can’t be fun for adults. The game is mostly about guessing what your opponent(s) will do in their next step. Fun small game, which will, at least I think it will, be lots of fun when playing with 5 or 6.

Though there's no way the real game could be as hilarious as playing it on BrettSpielWelt, this game is quite fun and surprising.  It's a little like playing RoboRally with everyone controlling one robot, but laying down their own bridge tiles and lives....

I think I need to play this one with more than two people. It's kind of fun to try and guess what cards your opponent is going to play but constantly shuffling back and forth over the same squares gets a little tiresome. My rating could go up or down rapidly on this game, depending on future plays.

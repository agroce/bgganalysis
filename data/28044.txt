Haven't yet completed a game, but wow this is a fantastic game for free.  Takes a good while to play and I was sold on it as soon as a mountain erupted into a volcano and destroyed my biggest city!

Update: now completed 2 games and in the midst of a 3rd.  Great little game, amazing for free.  Perfect for air travel!

RATING: 7
The first couple of turns of the scenarios are totally random and brutally harsh. If you get past this then there s plenty of scope for decision making and the game will come down to your ability to make the right strategic choices rather than the luck of the draw. As a 'free' game to download this is highly recommended and is the closest anyone has come to 'lite' (quick) civilisation building game

A pretty cool solo game; I like it. Some events can totally destroy you, especial early in the game, but really most of the time you can recover from them. It really feels like a Civ game, which is cool, though it feels kind of like a puzzle at the same time. The rules for the different events are kind of hard to remember, so you'll probably be checking the rules a lot the first several times you play.

Only 16 cards required, along with the rules. Very nice and easy to make a copy. I much prefer drawing my own map rather than using printed-out hexes.

The rules are a bit long for what is actually a simple game, but this is excellent. The game is quite mean and destructive (like Civ/Adv Civ) but it plays quickly and is very engaging. Definitely worth printing out and having a go.
*edit* more plays and I end up getting frustrated when the game manages to kill me off in the first few turns. (Tsunami is a killer on any coastal map) Puts me in a bad mood, which isn't why I game.

A challenging solitaire game that I haven't had to opportunity to try with the 2 player option.  Games I've played have run from the 30 minute mark up to 3 hrs (if the events are working in your favor).  Events are random but scaled well to an expected level of progress (Era).  Some games are brutal, other times you can get off lucky and advance unhindered.  An excellent pastime and my favorite print and play.

RATING: 7
Good P&P game that feels really "professionnal". Beware that making a "deluxe set" will probably cost you more than a traditionnal boardgame! 
The game is hard, quite fiddy, and has a real learning curve. 

The game takes a long time to play but is really enjoyable. It completely captures the "create your civilisation" feeling.

Hand built deluxe edition.  The technology tree does remind me of Avalon Hill's Civilization.

I think that if you make it through all 8 eras, its going to take quite a bit longer than 30 minutes.  My first game was well over 2 hours.

This is a truly brutal game which can be very frustrating.  On the other hand if you make it through the first several eras and can start developing technologies it becomes very rewarding.  Making it all the way through 8 eras should be considered a win.

I've never gotten to the point where I started considering building wonders.

Downloaded.  Played not on paper, but using Visio shapes.  Very fun.  -1 point for no components (i.e. web-published), but +1 point for being free.

The first few eras were fun, but by the 5th and 6th, I was simply "breaking even," continually fixing what broke during the last event.

Great Print and Play, and it certainly lives up to it's name.

Print out the tech tree and bring a nice eraser though, or your civilization will look disgusting.

It certainly hurts the "pocket" description though when you need the rulesheet.

Preliminary rating based on reviewing the rules and components - I'm eager to put this sucker together and try it out to see where a more definitive rating will fall. By all I've seen so far this looks to be an excellent empire building solitaire game. One that you download and put together yourself as fancy as your imagination and crafting ability allows. Very clever and I can see a strong call coming for a multi-player version once this becomes better known throughout the community.

Just way too unforgiving. It felt a bit more like "How my Civiliztion was Smited" than Civ-Lite. A lot of craftsmanship went into this one, but the end result just wasn't fun. Still, I'll probably mess around with the PC version when I'm bored. Alright, I tried a custom map that made all 8 regions useful, and finally survived a game.  It looks like it's just the scenarios that are so unforgiving.  I'll have to play around some more with this one, but it's growing on me.

The misuses of the words "decimate" (Did the author mean "devastate" instead? Perhaps merely "remove" would have been better.) and "affect" in the game are minor distractions.

Rating based on playing Scenario 1 only.  Subject to revision as I get to other scenarios or the full game.

Because I don't have a easy way to print out the Event cards in a suitable manner for making an actual deck out of, I instead use the Sun tokens from Ra (conveniently numbered 1-16) to simulate the deck, and refer to the corresponding event card when a token is drawn.

A gem.  Anyone interested in civilization building games should give this a try, hey what have you got to loose?

The events are real wrath of God, old Testament stuff.  I've found that if I can survive the first two Eras, I can survive the whole game.  The 26 page rule book is well written, in a conversational style, and the rules only really occupy the first 11 pages.

Someone may finally have created a two hour civilization building experience.  Will have to play more to access replayability (have played half a dozen times).

Thanks Scott!

UPDATE:  Had to dock the rating by a point as after enjoying the game for a couple plays I haven't had the urge to play in months.  I'd recommend fans of Civ building try the game, you won't be sorry.

It is not as much fun as the true Advanced Civ, but that would be asking too much. It has captured the flavour and you can play it almost anywhere. Note it takes me over 4 hours for a full game, far more than the 30 minutes quoted. But it is very easy to save the game position and come back later.

This is a good game! Even though it's solitaire, but I was surprised by the amount of decision need to be made for this kind of game. Quite mind exercise, but the randomization make the game tense and fun. 

The amount of details in events and civilization advances I think already make this game eligible for a full civilization game, not just civ lite. Perhaps the time needed, the pocket-sized game, and solo play, make this civ-lite, but the contents are definitely not!

RATING: 6.5
This PnP game has nice map tiles that interconnect like a puzzle giving you a variety of land masses. The counters are also very nice giving a nice touch to the whole theme. Game rules are easy and game play is fast, providing enough scenarios to keep you going. Although the concept and the mechanics of play are prototype the game itself gives you a hard time. Forming a civilization is easy but preserving it or even trying to upgrade its potentials is a hard almost an impossible task. From the first turn the disasters (earthquakes, barbarians, climatic conditions, epidemics etc) are such a burdensome that your civilization has more chances of perishing instead of advancing. It is a pity because the game is interesting; some home rules are needed to either soften the scale of disasters or to minimize their number and side effects. The player begs for having a chance to reach his goal. After all this is a game.

The 'Cheat Sheet' provided by Ryoga Unryu at the “Files” category might help soften this problem. Also, I hope that the anticipated 'Expansion' rules might even solve it.

Quote: "Scott has done a fantastic job capturing the essence of Tresham's Civ game with several interesting modern twists. Technology, wonders, tribe movement and growth are obvious nods to Tresham. The card deck as a randomizer and used to resolve calamities and events is brilliant. The variable board and scenarios give longevity.  It's worth the effort to make the deluxe version as constantly writing and erasing tribes can be messy."  
As a fan of civ-type games, I definitely want to try this one some time, and perhaps make a nice copy as a fun hobby project!

For a free web-published game this one is a keeper.  Has many of the fun parts of the board game Civilization with the added twin advantages of being solitaire and having a completion time of less than an hour.  If you know the board game Civilization then you will have a good understanding of many of the features of the game.  Probably the biggest down side of the game is that of any solitaire game, when you win it feels a bit unsatisfying.  You also are a little too much in control of your own fate as there is no competition for which technologies you can gain so you can plot your civilizations technology path with no fear of hitting any major road blocks in completing the plan other than having your civilization wiped out by Events before you get enough city advance values to get those technologies.

Pocket Civ is a great little Print and Play. Overall, like its title conveys, it's a civilization game that you can literally fit in your pocket (and takes a 'pocket' amount of time relative to larger Civ games!). It has war, strife, trade, exploration, development and technology: all the dressings of a civ game. While it can be played with as little as a notepad and a deck of (printed) cards or you can print out the beautiful re-design cards, make your own terrain tiles, and other components... but more about the game: Pocket Civ presents a constant stream of quiet times interspersed with grueling events that can be so vicious that you're teetering on the edge (sometimes, with not so unpleasant after-effects; e.g., a forest appearing after a flood takes out a region's population). Because of the variable set-up and the multi-purpose cards are multi-purpose (e.g., gold, events, event resolution, etc.), the game create a differing narrative every time. It is never obvious which branches of the tech tree you should climb (although you develop a sense of what *might* come as you play).

The designer's inclusion of 'training' scenarios was incredibly welcome -- otherwise, I'm not sure I ever would have been able to get an economy (of any sort) up and running!

You battle against the odds to see if you can withstand the hordes and natural disasters, while trying to grow and build.

Build your civ, trying to overcome all the disasters each turn. 

(Try the basic version with a sheet of paper for the map and some risk armies/cubes for the tribes.)

 Pocket Civ - This game is solo, lite Civ game. You control a number of tribes who multiply each turn. Each turn you will then move the tribes arond so you can plan to build or research a tech. Then comes the Event Card. You will check the next card in the deck to see what disaster happens. So an earthquake can take out a province, a tsunami can hit, a band of invading peoples may arrive, you may find you have a revolt or an epidemic....

After you resolve the event, (using involves losing tribes and cities) you can move on to what you had planned. Some times what you had planned doesn't work out. You can build cities or research teches. There are more than 50 teches, and about 15 different "trees" of tech items. You can get roads, fishing boats, government, banking, irrigation, metal working, arts, tools...

You have to last through 8 eras. After the event deck runs out, you have to score you VPs for that age, and reshuffle the event deck. As you might expect, the disasters become severe through each passing era.

Well, it's free so can't complain.  It's a simple civilisation game where you are trying to keep your 'tribes' and cities alive through the ages and overcome a crazy amount of potentially disastrous events along the way.

Every turn you're turning over an event card to see what horrible thing is going to happen to your people this time, this mechanic can get very annoying and frustrating but it's also what makes the game hard.  I've played it a couple of times and not won so far, but hey-ho it burned a few hours and was fairly fun at the same time.

I printed off the 'deluxe' version of the game and used some nice glass counters to represent my tribes, this way at least the game looks OK.  I'm not sure I could be bothered with drawing the map out myself and constantly erasing pencil marks.

I really like this solo game.  You are constantly battling the game's environment and trying to protect and advance your civilization.

The game's environment is portrayed through both the board and the "event" deck (a stroke of genius later taken by several games, including the popular [GameID=33468]).  At first the board seems very static, but after only a few "turns of events", the world really seems to come alive:  mountains erupt into volcanos, earthquakes destroy cities, desert sandstorms destroy your neighboring fields, etc.

Your little civilization also really seems to come alive. Throughout the game you research "Advances", each giving your civilization meaningful new abilities.  You build up and support cities in a way that is also meaningful: your cities need to be a certain "level" in order to research new "Advances".  Throughout this all, the main form of currency used to build and research (and another stroke of genius in the game) is your "Tribes".  I've found that I become attached to my little guys as they run around the board, trying to build up cities only to watch them crumble to the ground.

I feel the game time listed on the game's main page is a little understated, though I get faster the more I play.  Setup time can be a bit of an issue as well, and is a factor in my not getting more plays of this in.  

A quick note for anyone trying out this game for the first time... be prepared to lose, and often. Sometimes the cards can be very frustrating. Other times you will just barely scrape by, surviving through the last era... These games in particular will be so tense, you'll immediately understand why the game has a following. 

If you have the ability to build a deluxe version of this game, I highly suggest doing so (hint: [i]it's not that hard![/i]).  Here are a few blurry pics of my build:

Brutal game...  

Either way, I think the game should be called Pocket Survive.  The events are brutal.   It is very challenging.  I must say working with pen & paper is a neat experience.  

After a two hour session of getting beat up by more events, I'm probably done playing this.  It wasn't fun being a punching bag for that long. I quit during about halfway through the fifth era (longest I've made it yet), but saw the writing on the wall and knew there was no recovery.  As much as I like randomness, this is a tad too random beyond your ability to mitigate things.  I understand that you need to be picking timely advancements to help mitigate some of the events, but too much can go wrong too quick that there is no recovery sometimes.  I felt like I wasted my time.  Glad I only paid in printed paper and printer ink.

RATING: 6
This is the Dungeonquest of civ games. It ain't afraid to kill ya. Again and again and again. If you get hit particularly badly somewhere in the middle, you can very well find yourself not able to do anything the rest of the game but just barely scrape by, trying not to lose your last scrap of a tribe. This will leave you with not many interesting decisions. If somehow you avoid this common fate, the game itself isn't bad. The rules are a bit confusingly written and there are so many advances that affect so many events that all the look ups get tedious real fast. The scoring is strange in that it relates to how many tribes and advances you have on a particular turn in each era. Your cities could be decimated, you may not be able to advance your civ for ERAS as a result, but as long as you have as many tribes as advances on the last turn of an era, you get full credit for the advances you do have. It just doesn't make much sense. If your civ has grown stagnate from wars and plagues, why would you score the same that you would in more growing and vibrant eras? If this game wasn't so ingeniously designed to be played with a deck of event cards, a pencil and a pad of paper, I'd knock the score further...

RATING: 6
A very clever civ-building game. I certainly enjoyed the feel of the game as you watch the tribes develop and progress. And there was enough variation in events that there always seemed to be something new.

However, I found a number of problems. Firstly, the early game is too variable. The events are too devastating at the beginning, whereas at end game, events almost don't seem to matter much. There was no end game tension.

Secondly, keeping track of city AV for the advancement track was a pain because city AVs change so frequently. And finally, the technology tree was a bit weird in that at end game, you'd possess almost every technology. So there's no branching, its just a matter of which order you get technology.

This is an extremely long game. Solitaire, it took me nearly 2 hours. I don't think I could play this very often.

Card-based solo game with dudes on a map and random events. I didn't feel like I was building a civilization so much as doggedly expanding an ant colony in a yard, heedless of the fact that most of my underlings were being doused in gasoline and set on fire before getting around to doing, you know, ant things. I guess if you study the advances, events and cards closely you can nail down exactly which hurdles must be cleared before each era to give any chance of surviving, but the basic gameplay of shuffling people around trying to grow population only to have them beaten back to one corner of the map again didn't do it for me. Still, bonus points for including a "Huge Monolith of Impressiveness", even if I never got close to building one.

Of all the print and play games around on BGG, Pocket Civ is arguably the best and certainly one of the most well-known. It is also very unforgiving and it takes a certain amount of masochism to persist with it, as it seems that just when you are getting somewhere, along comes an Epidemic or a marauding bunch of Atalanteans and suddenly you are struggling to survive, never mind advance.  But you can get somewhere with some careful planning and a little luck and there is a certain amount of black humor in just surviving and scoring to the end of Era VIII.  Though why they put Wonders in there, I'm not sure.  Something to one day aspire to, perhaps?

Nice idea, even if not as minimalistic as origianlly intended.
Gameplay is very random: you may plan and do strategical choices, but the luck-of-the-draw of the Events will rule the game.
The flow of the game is continually interrupted by consulting the explanations of what Events do and which Advancements you may buy (and their effects). It's likely to be less of a problem with repeated plays, but the first times it is tiresome and boring.

Excellent game mechanic.  All of the various randomising elements needed for the game are summarised on the 16 Event cards.  Instead of lots of tables to consult by rolling dice, draw a card.  Rules need a read through a couple of times and then a test play and go back again to fully understand.  But, hey, it's a self published game so I might contribute some editing to the author for the fun he's given me.  Definitely worth the effort of assembling.  The only thing you MUST assemble is the 16 Event cards.  The other stuff you can do at your leisure.

The big daddy of print-and-play solo games. Probably only justifies the expenditure if you can take solo play seriously and have the time to study the rulebook, and impose your own interpretation on it. Frankly, you need to be able to devote some serious effort to this one, and I suspect that it's work that most of us would rather expend elsewhere. An impressive base for expansion, though.

A great print and play light civilization game. I love how you can play it with just printing out the event cards, the minimum of required components is a plus. It's fun drawing your world and then watching your empire grow and expand. The random events are definitely the exciting part. The tech list is long enough that it can be a bit confusing, but the graphical tech tree in the BGG files helps. Overall the game is a great civ sim, and a fun way to while away a few hours.

Update: It gets a little monotonous after a while, but the tech tree is what make the strategy interesting. Overall a fun game to try out.

I printed out the basic cards and ruleset and sat down on a snowy evening to try this out.  It took about 3 hours- I think that it would quite a bit shorter if I used the tiles and tokens instead of wearing out my eraser.

This game is tough- I spent the entire game nearly wiped out.  Which is good, because I certainly want to play it again and see if I can't do better if....

This is probably THE best print and play game I've tried so far. It's worth the effort to make the deluxe version as constantly writing and erasing tribes can be messy and troublesome (they will move around a fair bit).

Scott has done a fantastic job capturing the essence of Tresham's Civ game with several interesting modern twists. Technology, wonders, tribe movement and growth are obvious nods to Tresham. The card deck as a randomizer and used to resolve calamities and events is brilliant. The variable board and scenarios give longevity. Would be interested in seeing this properly developed into a two or more player game!

There are some rules ambiguities and there can be a lot of tracking/management througout the game but it's second nature once you're played it at least once. Oh, and like the original games, calamities can be pretty bad when they hit...God knows how many times I almost gave up after a flood turned into a Tsunami or how an epidemic rage through the lands. FANTASTIC!

Printed out only the event cards and it looks very good.  The game is playable only with the event cards.  I played a couple times and a few thoughts;
- Erasing and marking tribes every round is inconvenient.  Some cubes or glass beads will go a long way.
- Without advancement cards, it is easy to miss the prerequisites for the advancements.
Overall very good for such little effort.

This is an excellent solitaire game and I love it to pieces.  It's very fun and challenging, and really doesn't take a lot to set up -- just print out the cards and possibly rulebook if you don't play with a computer handy.  Some of the rules are contradictory, but I can look past that.

As a solitaire I would rate this a 9, but generally, I would rather play games with other people, so I rate this lower.

Artscow copy. Don't know if the prints are complete and correct, though. And that rulebook is horrible to get through.

[EDIT 1] Pff. Don't know if I should invest time into understanding this game or making sure its complete. This will take a while.

[EDIT2] For trade on the cheap as I don't really know for sure everything is printed correct and complete. Simply don't have the time to figure that out. If you have a stray promo lying around for a game I have, that is more than enough!

[UPDATE April 2015: Sold]

It is a pet peeve of mine, but the word decimate means to reduce by one tenth, not destroy, let alone annihilate.  Decimate is used repeatedly throughout the game's instructions in this incorrect manner.

I threw it in the trash.

1 player print-and-play game! Plexiglass strongly recommended! This a game to enjoy and "experience," rather than to win. If you try to win every time, you'll be frustrated to no end.

Early in the game, I feel like a passive observer watching the rise and fall of society, with little ability to do anything about it (very big luck component). Later on, if I survive, the game becomes a bit tedious -- it is harder to keep track of everything (advances, cities, etc). For the modest level of strategy it offers, the game seems more complex than it should be.

The game does not take 30min. It is closer to 3-4 hours for a run through 8 eras.

Final word -- I recommend video games rather than this 1-player board game.

This is an outstanding little game.  It scratches the civilization-building itch, is easily portable so suitable for playing in the hotel while on a business trip - especially if you stick to the paper & pencil (plus a few cards) version.  And it is just plain fun.

RATING: 7.5
nice solo game if relentlessly tough.
Still want a small civ game with a juicy event each turn (VPG style), as RTTA is too abstract (though great), Nations is too heavy, Nations Dice is too expensive and component heavy, blah,blah, blah

update Sept2015: Fond memories of this and would love a game identical to it with ace components. Either that or i need to finish my own deluxe version when I get the time.

update 2016: still so-oo want a decent game like this. Any help appreciated. Nearest to it, yet still miles away, was tiny epic kingdoms - must revisit that soon.

update 2017: can't stop thinking how I need a tight civ game with random events and a bit of travel, but 45 mins.

First Print and Play game I made. Still working on making deluxe version really deluxe (I have board of nice thickness, great event cards and some of the counters ready). 

Anyway as for the game I think it is a good solitaire game and those are rare in my opinion. It is annoying at times as best laid out plans are crushed by a might event card. Worthed to try as your first print and play.

PnP of the Basic Version

Damn! 16 cards, a piece of paper, a pencil and a rubber. So much fun with so little.

Of course it's a solitaire game and I would prefer to play multiplayer games if I have the chance. But if I don't get a chance, I'm fine playing this one.

This was a bit of a treasure find for me. Downloaded it and made my version which looks very nice... I am proud of it. And I LOVE solo games. This one seems to have been a labor of love for its designer. You can get squashed very early in this game which is my only reservation but hey - ya just start over right - no biggy. I pull this out now and again for a bit of mental downtime and I can rate it a 6 with no reservations - that may rise with repeated plays of fall. I am really into  the look of games and for a Print and Play game this is VERY well done - but - I'd love to see an card images representing each of the advancements though I know that would be a lot of work. But it would add significantly to the flavor of the game. I also think that the chits can be a lot better and several bits added to represent the tribes, cities and a city levels. When/if published i am sure these issues will be addressed. Not sure about the quality of all the scenarios but still working through them and need to give them multiple plays before I can comment. Overall a very good effort by Scott Slomiany and I commend him.

Yes, I not only was able to play it on a plane; playing it got me through a mild plane-anxiety. I used a Franklin planner, and put the "draw pile" under the left flap and the "discards" under the right flap. Pocket Civ is a very interesting and terrific game. There were a couple of minor rules quirks that I think can be ironed out that might make the score go even higher. I imagine this could be made into a computerized PDA version which would add to its portability.

A brilliant little civ game played with pen, paper and a handful of cards.  The genius of the game is its use of movable tribes as a building resource, income generator and military might. The tension ratchets up as your civ staggers from era to era, and the cost of surviving grows just as the dangers tear you down. When I found myself wanting to tell stories about my people and their tribulations, I realized PocketCiv had hooked me just like computer Civ did. Doesn't yet live up to its goal of being pocket-sized, because you need the encyclopedic rulebook to remind yourself how events and advances interact. Also, pen and paper tribe movement isn't practical; I use pennies. Rules and terminology need a polish, which is said to be in the works.

Genius. This game wouldn't be my desert island pick however. Why bring it when I would already be guarenteed to have the sand to draw the map and the pebbles to be my tribes?

Excellent empire-building game with a nicely narrative feel and lots of clever mechanics using the multi-talented Event cards. Basic version is excellent when there are space issues, and Deluxe is superb if you have a table to play on as well as the time to get all of the components together. 

Events can sometimes be way too harsh, especially in the first Era. I think I had a case of beginners luck the first time I played, as I survived to Era 4. The next few games saw the destruction of my miniscule empire in Era 1, thanks to Attacks and Earthquakes.

For a print and play game, Pocket Civ is of especially high quality. Absolutely excels, and I would be more than happy to pay for a boxed version (solitaire empire building games are thin on the ground) - and the fact that this is available totally free is the icing on an already very appetising cake.

Yay, done with everything. First read of the rules looks very promising and all the components are (of course, because I did them :D )excellent.
After two plays: very good game indeed! Has a lot of decision making and the typical civ feel. The events add a constant danger to your civilization. Really lots of cool aspects like visiting traders, sending out expeditions, floods.. everything a civ-fan needs.
Excellent job for a free game!

Would have been a 9 but I distracted one point for the fiddlyness (even though I made the deluxe version) you still have to move around a lot of tribes and deal with adding and removing counters each round.

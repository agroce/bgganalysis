Rated slightly higher than the base game if only because I really don't mind playing this with children and watching their reactions to the various cards played (either with confusion or laughter). The cards here also work better as they are easily understood and more relatable to kids. For kids who don't know how to read pick up Disney Apples to Apples.

Not quite as fun as the original, may in part be due to the ages of opponents associated with this game.  Maybe when the boys are older they will appreciate playing with their friends.  The more culturally literate they become, the more likely they'll play the original.  [Thift $1.09]

RATING: 6
Apples sans red cards that fly over childrens' (or certain adults') heads.

This, does help the game considerably, all things considered, as in standard apples, you may get saddled with a Georgia O'Keeffe card or something, which is going to rot away in your hand with a group that is completely unfamiliar. What an ugly sentence.

Similar to regular Apples to Apples, but a bit more bland.  Very random.  An OK party game.

RATING: 7.5
Good game - seems more of an international version than the crate!

I think the Junior version is actually a better version, as an Aussie some of the cards in the original are too US centric - ie: half the time the celebrites are completely unknown to us.  As such, this game, with far fewer 'personalities' is really a fantastic version of the game.

My class loves playing this game...the first few rounds are usually 'endured' by the kids, but then someone willthrow down an amusing card, and they will really get into it.

My son received as a gift 12/23/06

--Played with five...a "dumbed down" version for kids.  Loses much of its luster but this is a nice tool for working on relationships and word pairings for younger kids.

I'll warn you that the "9 " version was easily handled by a six-year old, so I'm guessing that the one that's just "Junior" is even more elementary than that.  If you have a 5-8 year old I'd still recommend the "9 ".


EDIT:  If the base game has suffered in my eyes, then the "JR." version suffers all the more.  The only real fun left in Apples to Apples are dick and Hitler jokes.  These are both sadly missing from the kids version, imagine that.

RATING: 7
After a year of  owning the starter it never gets time and is repetitive.  Both kids are now over 10 and switched to standard for more variety (though historical figures and places they may not know).  Seemed like whoever got "burned toast" and "marykate and ashley" always had a winner going for gag answers.  Almost never played now, in my house but, for a year or so it was the bomb for kid guests.

Just as good as the standard version, even for adults. It merely removes things like "Jacques Cousteau" that kids aren't going to understand. If you are thinking about Apples to Apples and have kids, this one is definitely the way to go, and you could even have fun without the kids. There are less cards than in the original game however, so you may not get as many plays of this one before becoming bored with the lack of variety. Review of the original follows:

In 1998, there were basically two types of party game: Trivia or Charades. Trivia rewards players for various types of knowledge outside of the game; Charades can include drawing, acting, singing, etc., but the goal is to get your team to guess a clue. Apples to Apples started a paradigm shift. 

In this game, one player is the judge. The judge flips a green card with an adjective such as "disgusting" written on it. The other players will then each secretly select a red card from their hands with a noun on it, often a proper noun. The selected cards are shuffled so the judge does not know which player gave which card. The judge then looks at them and selects which card he/she feels best fits the adjective on the green card. The player who selected that card gets a point, and someone else becomes the judge. 

It's an easily accessible concept that will quickly appeal to those more of an empathetic mind than a mathematical one. Probably for that reason, the typical strategy gamer may not find much here to like. A player who finds himself annoyed at the judge's choices, rather than amused by them, will not enjoy this experience. Other times, luck of the draw may play a large role. Ultimately, all the players have the same decision to make each turn: which of these cards is best? Sometimes none of them seem good, sometimes many of them do, but long-term planning and clever tactics will not be found in this game.

Apples to Apples single-handedly redefined the party game genre. For that, it rightly deserves its place in board game history. Nevertheless, much like in music, innovation on the part of the creator doesn't always translate to enjoyment on the part of the consumer, and I feel that is the case here.

I know it's the kids version of Apples-to-Apples . . . but taking out the very specific "cultural reference" red apple cards that adults will know in favor of more generic red apples cards that kids will know just took some of the cleverness out of the game for me (from an adult perspective).

The kids enjoyed this one a lot, however.

RATING: 4
This is kind of fun as a party/light game: just come up with apt or amusing comparisons. Probably better with more than with the minimum listed number of players (four), as pretty much everyone's going to figure out who has each card. Some decent vocabulary-development possibilities. Nice components. My gripe is that the rules framework is so light and the judge's role so subjective that even kids who make a good comparison are as likely to get the shaft as kids who make goofy ones. That's OK in an adult party game, where everyone knows not to take it seriously, but fairly young kids may not understand.

This rating is probably unfair, but the reduced difficulty of the words underestimates (IMO) a 9-year old's vocabulary and reduces the worth of the game.  I played it with teenagers and it was a waste of time.  I would rerate it after playing with people of the appropriate age.

Like the adult version this game relies heavily on the general mood of the participants.  If they are ready and willing to laugh and joke around and try to find the silly humor in card combos it can be fun.  Most of the truly funny card combos are beyond the target audience.  However it is a good game for kids with cards targeted to their general areas of interest and can be a great way to reinforce their reading skills.

We've had great fun with all of the A2A games we've tried, and they're doing the "kids versions" better than any other party game out there. When my kids were very young, we used the Junior set, and when they got a bit older it was fantastic to see the Junior 9  set available. Some kid editions of games seem like they were published by people who don't know kids, but here's Out of the Box with enough sense to know exactly what works with kids of different ages.

Okay game, some words still too abstract/unknown for young kids.  Kids feel bad when their word isn't chosen and it's hard to help your kid by making sure you pick their word.

Unsurprising given it's a "kiddie" version, but it lacks some of the potential for innuendo and hence hilarity that the full game provides.

01/04/2013: This is a fun game to play with younger kids (under 12 or so).  It's light and easy to play.  There aren't as many cards/options or as much humor as the standard version, but it worked well for our family for a long time.  Since our girls are a little older now, we've recently moved on the the standard game.

Our family got this game as a gift last Christmas.  The kids love it.  One player picks a card and the other players try to pick a card in their hand that is the closest match.  Sometimes (or a lot of times) the two have nothing in common.  This game is not so much as winning I think as much as just laughing at the respones of others.  Sometimes we get so obsessed with winning a game we forget why we are playing. To have fun, human interaction, and the memories it creates.

Replay Value: 6 (Cards will repeat after about 10-15 plays I'll estimate, so not too strong.)
Scaling/Players: 9 (The game can be played with a variety of numbers.  Definitely a strong suit.)

A friend of mine criticized this game as being far too subjective to even be called "a game" I have to respectfully disagree.  For those of us who play games to have fun-- we understand this game.  For those who play to win or lose, you'll never "GET" this game.  Play this game with children and you will understand what is meant by the game!

Wow - I read lots about this game, and even played out hands multiple times, but didn't understand what it's appeal was until multiple rounds were actually played out by an invested group. Like many party games, it is a function of the players involved that creates the fun. And it can be quite fun. Successful game, with gamers and non-gamers alike.

Perhaps even better than the adult version, since everything is simpler and both kids and adults can enjoy the gameplay.  Certainly this is a fun party game that appeals to non-gamers and is one of the better ones in the genre.

[Out of the Box 2nd (2005) edition] {Kid, party; word, vote, creativity; optimal 6-10p} Apples to Apples is a loud and fun party game. I think this edition is more suitable for Hong Kong students than Apples to Apples because the words are more concrete and less US bias :laugh:

This plays exactly the same as the regular version of Apples to Apples.  The main difference is there are some more hints for the words on the cards to make it a little easier for kids.  Also, no suggestive cards are included, so this would be a good version of the game for those who would like to avoid those.

In a way, the kid's version is better because people have never come across a card they didn't know, which happens often in regular Apples to Apples. However, the simplistic cards are a bit more limiting in any discussions as choices seem a bit more obvious.

Wow, after a lively, fun bunch of people convinced me to play this recently, I was sure my rating was going down.  I'd forgotten that I'd already appropriately rated it a [b][bgcolor=#ff3366] 2 [/bgcolor][/b].  Mistake #1:  [family=33]Apples to Apples[/family] should be played at most to 5 cards, not 10.  Since the nature of the "game" doesn't evolve as you play it (just do the same thing every single turn), there's no reason to make it long.  Make it short, and let people have fun for the whole 10 minutes.  If they're still hungry for more, they will play again.  If they're ready to move on, they can, guilt free.  30 minutes indeed!  Two hours, minimum.  See my comments on the parent game for more proper complaints.

Got the Day of Days base set and Road to Carentan expansion. Also got some extra guys so that there are about 8 soldiers to a side.

The rules are surprisingly obtuse.  Also, the game is designed to tell a story (using some very innovative soldier characteristics), but for some reason we never seem to get much of a story out of the game when we play.  It's  been fun to play, but it's just not as evocative as I thought it would be.

RATING: 7.5
Very fun squad level combat game.
It's not as challenging as a puzzle such as Combat Commander, but it's a pretty fun experience nonetheless.

PROS:
1. Eurogamers will like this game for the components and ease of play. Very good introduction to squad-level wargames.
2. Deck customization - You can build a squad with more adequate soldiers for the task at hand on each scenario. That, in itself, can be a very fun part of planning how to engage a specific mission.
3. Just like Combat Commander, the game is not decided until the very end. Even when things seem lost, there will always be a chance to revert the situation heroically.
4. The minis are extremely cool.


CONS: 
1. The rules are so streamlined that it probably won't produce many fans among the more seasoned squad-level wargamers. I'm not super impressed myself. And there are a few loopholes on the first version of the rules.
2. I disliked the fact that you don't have LOS obstacles on the rules. Being able to shoot through buildings is a no-go for me. I ended up creating a house rule for that and a few other things.
3. Secret objectives are not that varied for each scenario. It's easy to deduce what's your opponent's objective. 
4. Pretty luck dependent.

In conclusion, it has some space for developing a few interesting combat tactics and it delivers a very fun experience, but it will never be at par with more challenging games like Combat Commander or Conflict of Heroes.

RATING: N/A
I've played one scenario from one of the expansions at a table with six players. I don't think I've played the game enough to give it a numerical score, but I can certainly tell you where it hits and misses with me.

Misses:

• Expense: You can't get around it. Its cost places it out of reach of speculative purchasers who are trying to decide if they like it or not. In a back-handed way, this is good. The ambivalent, finicky sort who complain about anything after they decide they don't like something are discouraged right off from sticking their nose in it.

• Narrow focus: Everything about the game puts you either with an American Airborne or German Luftland squad in Normandy in June of 1944. The painted figures, the scenario descriptions, the art on the cards, the art on the terrain tiles... Yet, once you get to playing, it could be opposing squads with a mix of bolt-action and automatic weapons just about anywhere, couldn't it? Would the game be much different if the the action were set on the Eastern Front in 1943? Or Guadalcanal, 1942?

• Miniatures are fussy: Anyone who knows me knows I prefer that game boards and tables be gridded or regulated with areas or the like in some way. A lot of argument and doubt about moving and where things are are eliminated. Movement with a ruler naturally leads to people fussing with their pieces. The irregular shapes of the stands and the barely discernable arcs lead to people saying things like "I meant to be facing this way. No I wanted to be in the cover." And a careless bump can change everything. Again, this is a peeve of mine and not with everyone and the word I used was "prefer!"

Hits:

• Other than moving an measuring with the ruler in certain cases, I like how you simply string LOS between figures and count the number of terrain squares passed over minus  modifiers for hinderances. That makes combat go quickly and, in small games, you can almost guess whether you're in a particular range band with near certain accuracy. Since our first game was a squad game (3 players to a side, 3 or 4 figures apiece) there was some noodling. But once experienced, its understood.

• Card-driven mechanics: Like Combat Commander, everything is thoroughly integrated into play of the cards. No dice and very few counters to clutter the table. Once you understand how it works, it works like a charm. Unlike Combat Commander, there are no "dead hands"—or they are fleetingly rare. In every phase of every turn you can certainly do _something effective._ Moving, Looking, Shooting, Hiding. Almost without fail, your troops can do something productive inside that peculiar OODA loop.

• Expandability/Adaptabilty: While playing, I imagined other genres where the SMG could be applied: The Wild West, Far Future, Star Wars/John Carter science fantasy, French and Indian War, Ancients/Medievals, Pirates on the Spanish Main... I also drew favorable comparisons to several of my favorite games: Combat Commander, Star Wars: Epic Duels, Heroscape, Wings of Glory... The system could go anywhere.

• Production: The quality of the physical components is top-notch. If you don't like SMG, you don't like the _game._ Period. Other than the rules, there's nothing else for a purchaser to complain about. The box, the board, the pieces, the play aids... This game meets the highest standards.

RATING: 7.4
This is a very cool game that could be among the top tier of miniature games if not for a host of flaws.  

I followed this game heavily for over a year before buying into the system as I had a difficult time convincing myself to pull the trigger.  What really drew me to the game was the following features:

-The action deck system is great.  Soldiers come with a unique set of cards which are added to your deck pool (think deckbuilding to some extent) and influence your available actions as well as outcomes of those actions.

-Soldiers are completely unique, as in no one else will have a soldier with the exact same stats.  This is very cool that the company is able to do this, although it does result in some negatives as it increases cost (printing cards on demand) and can result in you receiving a soldier which doesn't fit your playstyle (You really favor long range shooting but you receive Private Biggles who is ineffective at Long but dynamite at Short range).

-The artwork is reminiscent of Sgt. Rock and the Haunted Tank.  This is a personal thing but it drew me in.

-The game is relatively fast paced and works to streamline some elements which bog down traditional miniature games.  

-Terrain is 2D tiles which makes storage and variety a selling point, as opposed to having to model your own terrain.  After storing a table full of 20mm Vietnam Jungle in my basement, I can certainly appreciate this games portability.

The game really does play pretty well, but I feel I must be clear about its negative points as well.  All of the following are holding the game back from being phenomenal in my opinion:

-Price.  The game is god-awful expensive.  The minis are pre-painted (quite well) but cost around $10 a piece.  Much of this price is probably due to the print on demand nature of the cards but it is a bit hard to swallow if you wish to build up a good 20 figures per side.

-A messy rulebook.  The rulebook has been improved as time as gone on but it is still ambiguous on many things and missing details.  Additionally, new content that is released continues to be plagued with ambiguities.  

-Idiosynchrosies which you just have to live with.  Stuff like Grenades being totally ineffective and not worth using.  The Panzerfaust being overpriced (points-wise) for its one-shot ability that packs a weak punch.  Germans being generally ineffective at long range (despite the Mauser Kar98K outclassing the Garand's maximum effective range), MG gunner that do not need to operate with their assistants, Soldiers occassionally having Short Range stats that exceed their Long Range (Long Range should be upped to equal Short Range - it just looks goofy with Short being longer), etc.  

I really do like the game and the new 3D terrain looks fantastic.  The component quality is excellent although you pay out the nose for it.  I don't regret my purchase, I just regret some of the decisions the company has made.

I really like this game and have a lot of fun playing it with a local friend. I own everything possible to own with the exception of the recently released British Modules, etc. I can handle the high cost, but I believe it needs tighter written rules to raise my rating. Although very enjoyable, we have had to "learn by doing" when it comes to some of the expansions...most notably the Team Panels. Because of time spent trying to figure out how they are supposed to be played, less time is spent on pure game play. We did discover that the Team Panels really enriched the experience. There has been some discussion on creating videos to further explain aspects of gameplay, but without a tight set of written rules, I don't believe this approach would turn out to be very useful.

RATING: 4
Firstly, I am a Strategic wargamer, not a tactical one. I want units not people with names. If I want to name my people I'll play Agricola. Secondly, the guy who taught me, I'll call him...Brian set the game up with two new players on one team and two experienced players on the other, including himself. Thirdly, this is a game in which each side is given an equal number of build points however, not really since his side had a lesser number of solider points, which is what a team needs to win. Fourthly, Brian wasn't playing so that the people that were learning had fun, he played so that he had fun, which is not what you want. A teacher should want to instill the the desire to play again. Fifthly, he lied about the time required to play. Sixthly, after the game was over he went and explained way the game is clever and why he has spent over $500 on this game.

The story mechanic limits what I can allow my soldiers to do on a given turn, which is good for the story, but frustrating, just as it is in games using similar mechanics, like A Game of Thrones. The programmed action mechanic is better done in Pirate Dice, Roborally, and Himalaya.

Players take on either the Germans or US Paratroopers, and skirmish their way through the first day or two of the Normandy campaign.  This is a miniatures skirmish game, that has been blended with a card driven boardgame.  Players set up their forces of 4-8 miniatures, draw an orders card which gives them a secret objective, then play their way through the selected scenario.  Story cards are flipped up, which may trigger a random event, but more importantly dictate which actions the players can take this turn.  Players then play action cards from their deck, in line with the permitted actions from the story deck.  Actions include MOVE, LOOK (spot enemies, or draw more cards), HIDE (unspot yourself, or stash cards) and SHOOT.  The cards are everything here, with most cards granting the base action to the named solider, but often granting some sort of bonus ability to any soldier in your force.  Shooting comes down to card flipping also (i.e. diceless), with hit and wound results present on the action cards.  It all feels a bit weird and alien, but after a couple of turns it begins to gel and is actually a lot of fun.  The production is a mixed bag - the minis and tiles that make up the playing area are brilliant - great painting on the miniatures.  The cards are good - clear and colourful.  The rules however seem to omit several key points, some of them important, but they are evolving and getting better.  The base idea, where every soldier is literally unique - an individual with his own pros and cons - is very interesting, and you do feel a bit like a squad leader choosing the right men for the job.  Very expensive, but a lot of fun.  Looking forwards to seeing where this concept goes.

Just play this with the expansion today; I could fall in love with this game. It still needs a few more rules renditions to smooth out the crinkles, but still very playable the way it is. 

Its also the type of game that is dying for house rules, I am not saying that the game needs it, but it seems very modifyable to me. 

What is in the box is an excellent balance of tactical combat, chaos of man-to-man combat, good narrative, and yet simplified miniature rules that is very approachable and the card-driven mechanics make the game very quick to play. 

Highly recommended. Can't want for more expansions.

Loving it.

(I am also using the really nice tile map to play Classic Battletech: Total Warfare on it. The scale isn't quite right but the terrain features work very well with Battletech and with some overlaid to introduce hills and water features (those from Battletech Hexpack: Lakes and Rivers), its quite the visual feast with out the hassles of actual 3D terrain and certainly looks better than the original maps.)

Very interesting system that has a lot of neat features and plays different every time you try it.  We played the same scenario three times in a row with wildly different stories every time.  The rules take a bit to get the hang of, not because of complexity but just that they use some new ideas.  I got a demo from one of the designers so that helped a bit.  Overall not a hard game to learn however.

Also, the ideas of individual soldiers (other than the ones who are part of the "story", they are different in every box) is pretty cool.  Especially eventually being able to register them on the web site and being able to get updated stat cards for them as they continue their cardboard military career.

Components are top notch all the way.  The minis look great, the puzzle boards fit together better than any other similar board I own, the cards are sturdy, and the boards and markers are made of the best and toughest cardboard I've seen in a wargame.  

Cheap?  No.  Worth it?  In my opinion yes.  Certainly not every game is for every gamer, but this one really flows well, and tells a great story, and will no doubt see many plays.

EDIT: After more plays have raised my rating.

RATING: 9
Pros- 

Beautiful high quality components. I love that each soldier has it's own card and personality, as that helps add to the theme and fond recollections of actions the soldier took during the game. I love the various levels that you can play leaders as, from Private, Corporal to Tech Sergeant. I love how the Cause and Effect works to add some random events/situations during a game to make each game unique and add to the replayability. 

I've played table top miniatures games before and I enjoy them too, as you might have unique units that might have their own personality. This game scales it down to where an individual soldier is that larger unit in a sense, so instead of a company or regiment, you have a soldier with it's own strengths and weaknesses. 

I like how the orders cards create certain objectives that the opponent isn't going to be aware of until they see something you're up to, but it's not an upfront situation where each player can plan for counters toward the others objective as they won't know and have to change on the fly. Some scenarios are straight forward kill them all, so those are nice for those that want to know how to strategize from the beginning. 

I really like the Victory Point system for paying for soldiers and equipment, and the ways to earn VP's to win the game. So while a force might get eliminated completely, the player still might be able to win if he fulfilled his objective/s for VPs and killed/captured some of the enemy to get more VP's. Sometimes in battles, even if a small unit gets clobbered, if they did their job beforehand, they could still have helped affect victory for the big picture of the battle. 

Set-up of the map is really quick and there's plenty of variety.

It's nice to be able to play a miniatures game like this real quick after getting it w/o having to assemble and/or paint a bunch of figures, or having to have a dedicated large gaming table with a lot of terrain to have to buy, make etc.


Cons -

As everyone knows, this is an expensive game to get into, but for me I wanted a WWII miniatures game and it was between this and getting into Flames of War. I figured that I'd spend as much with that game system, but have to spend a ton of time painting and whatnot, as well as not as easily get non-miniatures gamers to try it out. So while it's expensive, the bottom line is that it will be more accessible for people I can introduce it to.

The rules can be a little vague at times in some spots. I know that LBG have been working on these and have already made updates and improvements from earlier releases. I have the newest 1.72 updated rules, so they are pretty good. While any questionable rule can be easily discussed and agreed upon by players, it would be essential to have everything really tight for tournaments so there is one source of rules that are airtight. That said, it's often easy enough to get questions answered here at BGG. I try to think of questions either from reading the rules, or during or after a game so that I can ask them here and get answers for the next game.

Fantastic hybrid miniature wargame with several boardgame elements.  Though some lack of clarity in the rules made my first solo games take a while to figure out, repeated play has really proven the elegance of the rules system.

Fits nicely into my collection, and a joy to play.

I have all the supplements and am looking forward to more opportunities to test the system out.

RATING: 6
I can see why some people like the game.  But I think it is too expensive to pay for the amount of enjoyment for its price.  You need the expansion set in order to play the base game fully.  I like the variable terrain tiles and the miniature soldiers rendered in complete colors, each soldier is individualized as to his combat abilities, the changing scale between short (measured in inches) and long (measured in square) ranges, simplifying the shooting procedure, etc.  The system is essentially diceless: checking line-of-sight, number of hits and the result of the hits by flipping the next action card.  The order system is also random, so as the action cards in your hand that can only be played to activate the soldiers if they match those on the order track.  This is something like Combat Commander - that you don't have the right card at the right time to do the right thing.  In one game, I saw that the whole German squad cannot enter into the theater of operations simply they don't have the move cards!  Soldiers can self-rally, of course, with a card of "cover".  Throwing a grenade?  Check the "blast" in the next card.  Although I won the game the first time I played it, I am still not convinced.  It is too random to my taste and I don't find any coherent tactics that I should employ in order to win the game.  I won because I have a good special objective card - capture three large areas on the board, and by "capture", it doesn't mean you have to "hold" it until the end of the scenario.  Yep, I killed some krauts from the house to round out the win.  It is a good game.  But it won't be a realistic miniature game for anyone who is interested in learning good tactical lesson.  I am not a miniature fan.  Not that this one could lure me into it either.

RATING: 8.25
A unique miniature/CDG hybrid utilizing uniquely generated soldiers possessing individual strengths and weaknesses. A game producing action with memorable storytelling highlights.

SMG is a system that immediately benefits from expansion beyond the base game. Adding the expansion Road to Carentan and a couple more leaders and weapon crews per nation will give you the best experience with SMG, but tactical squad based aficionados will be satisfied if they can afford that much expense.

2016 update: 5 years after release the rules for much expansion material remains disheveled, particularly with respect to X-terrain additions (buildings, for example).

More importantly, the recent introduction of an entirely different scaled version of the game (Sergeant's D-Day) and endless armored unit expansions seems destined to bury the original SMG squad-based experience under its tank treads. SMG originally showed such potential but looks to be a very slow growth stock. Expensive and perpetually in need of tighter rules, it perhaps looks better than it plays and the BGG ratings seem to reflect that.

A dynamic turn sequence combined with beautifully painted minis make this game a winner.  Very easy to learn but difficult to master.  Full review coming soon to www.armchairgeneral.com

Really enjoyable game system... Not for those looking for a discount WWII game. Stay for the long haul and you won't be disappointed!

To fully confess, I'm not all that into miniatures games. I found there to be some good elements here, such as the action pairs, where one type of action goes before another, as well as the hidden victory conditions. The problem that I have with this is that your soldiers get pinned all too easily and then can hardly move. Perhaps this is an accurate representation of squad combat, but it means a lot of distance shooting and trying to get lucky with some wound or kill cards.It also seems to be long for what it is; I'd rather play some Command & Colors to get the feel for some beer-and-pretzels, light wargaming.

Refreshing and innovative system that is fun to play. Unfortunately Day of Days (the first title released) is only an introductory game that requires additional purchases of figure and map expansions to get the true feeling the author has designed. This game is definitely one to try if looking for a easy WWII tactical level game... If your pockets are deep enough. My review in the forum covers my thoughts and the community's counter points.

The rules seemed a bit messy, with no explanation as to what to do if a figure is across multiple tiles  and the modifiers never really being clear as to how they actually worked, this seems to be another Kickstarter game where you get a bunch of miniatures and then go in search of the game.

The story cards were a nice idea, but in reality they just impost semi-random restrictions on what you can do meaning that you're playing the game as much as your opponent. If my opponent is occupying a feature that I suspect he needs to hold to win why are my soldiers unable to attack him just because of the story cards?! They're standing right in front of him! Beyond that, I liked the variable turn order based on the story cards, but once everyone was in range* it seemed like the best thing to do just about every time was shoot, shoot, shoot as your three actions. *The range is utter bullshit - A range of 9 squares when the game comes with a 4x5 tile set up means that you're expected to buy 5 or more sets before options like 'Look' become even vaguely worthwhile. This massive range basically restricts all of the decisions in the game to 'stand at the edge of the board, in cover if you can find any and shoot until everyone is dead'. It felt entirely devoid of strategy. Oh, I suppose different objective cards may change that but since they're hidden, why not just kill everyone first and then achieve your goal? There are also lots of issues with vagueness. Such as the objective to hold 1/2 of the terrain features. If your opponent isn't entering the board until turn 2, if turn 1 is a lot of moves, can you win before they have a chance to respond?

After getting a chance to play at Cincycon 16, I decided I had to have it.  Found a 1st Edition version at a good discount that made the cost feel a bit better, but the game is a pretty good deal for what you get.  I like painting miniatures, but this game allows me to get a game on the table right out of the box.  Downside is that even for the smallest scenarios from the included scenario book, you need a few more troops.  To go with this game, I also bought the Game Masters accessory pack that has more markers and things to help show sequences.  Interesting system that I hope to be running this fall for Advance The Colors.  Also wanted to point out that, although I bought this game elsewhere, Lost Battalion Games still honors their policy of sending the materials to update the first edition to the second with 2 additional figures and their cards, the thinner board edge pieces, and the play mats that the cards go on, just mention this when ordering other expansions or figures direct from them.

Haven't been this excited about a game system in quite some time.  It's a miniatures game, a card game, and a board game all in one.  LBG has demonstrated good support in improving the rules presentation as well as answering questions and posting references on BGG.  The system is simple and dynamic, which is what keeps it fun.  I like the story driven aspect.  Be advised if you're looking for complexity and detailed realism coupled with scenarios that closely mirror historical situations, this probably isn't the game for you.  Entry price point is what I'd expect for a miniatures game with pewter bits and pre-painted figures.  The component quality is top-notch both in card quality and board materials.  No sign of warping tiles.  What a concept.  Given the card mechanics, there's a lot of replayability in that even the same scenarios will play out differently.  I'm looking forward to more great things from this game.   I do have a few minor aesthetic issues that don't detract from gameplay that keep me from giving it a perfect 10, still I think it's worth a high rating for reasons beyond aesthetics.

I will also note that my set which arrived in Feb. 2012 came with a full color copy of the new rules set 1.72, the player aid card and the first scenario walk through guide. Also, my minis had a matte finish and not the glossy coating seen on lots of the photos here on BGG. 

I'm appending this to note that this probably isn't a game for everyone though it fills a nice gap for miniature WWII gamers wanting something both lighter and different than more traditional mini games like Battle Front or Flames of War.  If you like more traditional boardgames like Tide of Iron, or even the Axis & Allies: Miniatures, this might be a game you'd enjoy.  If you're a die hard ASL gamer, this one will have less control and more luck than you probably enjoy in your tactical gaming, though it might be a break from it.

I'm further appending this to note a significant drop in my rating due to lack of support for this game from the publisher in terms of addressing rules issues and errors. Still a good game but you'll need a passion for it.

Good game, but you need a lot of space. Random card draw whch can be seen as a plus or drawback. No armor. Range seems off in regard to scale. Hence the bigger the board the better. Not too much rule referencing.

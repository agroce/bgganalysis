First Play. The rules are well laid out and easy to reference, but I do wish publishers wouldn't print white text on a black background to be all final frontier with the theme. Its a bitch to read.

The game itself works but there is significant randomness dealt out by the phase 3 cards that can only be guessed at. They seem to be a catch up mechanism but early game it's a lottery whether they will fall for you or not. After that the game felt very dry to me, more an elaborate optimisation puzzle than an enjoyable game. Yes there is some limited interaction but all predictable stuff. This does result in AP and people winding back moves to optimise benefits when better options are realised. The game ran long for 2.5 hours after rule explaining but it seemed longer. There were huge periods of silence between turns as people crunched the data on their best moves.

The secret bonuses and their rewards don't seem to reflect the effort needed to do them and for some players were achieved incidentally to their moves with no additional effort (one player even forgot about his bonus but had achieved the goal anyway).

Finally the production is pretty rough around the edges. One player board with the planet details is heavily wrinkled owing to poor manufacture and the setting out for the celestial tiles and certificates is badly offset so part of the graphic is cut off on the majority of tiles.

The others said they would play again but I really don't want to. Up for sale.

Space exploration game, kind of a point salad. You have 16 turns to get the most out of it and you can't do everything you want, that's a plus.

A very tight euro 3x game with a very cool theme. The game has a limited amount of turns which makes for a tense and tough game. It is one of those game where you feel like you can't do enough each game.

I like the theme and it is used wonderfully here. All the actions make sense thematically. The game plays surprisingly fast and is quite easy to master.

RATING: 9
Still early days, but so far so good.  This is a tough resource management game where you really have to think of the long game.  I want to burn resources every round to take Bonus Actions, but if I do, I'm probably leaving myself with cripplingly bad rounds at the end of the game.

After a few more solo games, I'm impressed with this design.  The resource management is so super tight.  My best scores have been in games where I am barely hanging on to enough resources during the last round.  Every extra unneeded cube has been burned.  I'm a little curious about how tight the board gets in multiplayer games, as there is no incentive to race out into the outer reaches of the board in a solitaire game except to score points for the farthest planets and to possibly complete an objective card.

Solo scores:
The Edge of the Galaxy
Level 1: 33 points
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The mission cards may end up making the game feel more samey not less. 

Whether to burn resources in the Clausius Pit for extra actions can be a tense and a quality decision.

The tech tree is ok but doesn't generate enough tension or excitement or a reason to want to try a different way next time since certain tech is required for certain planets. 

Components are decent.  Action selection like Scythe/Vinhos works well and keeps AP and downtime low.

Didn't feel there was much to explore here so I got rid of it after a few plays.

Gradevole gioco ambientato nello spazio. Mi pare il tipico gioco che fa tutto benino svolgendo il proprio compitino ma non mi ha lasciato sensazioni particolari, anzi per molti aspetti mi è venuto naturale pensare ad altri giochi come Eclipse (ambientazione e tematica di fondo di esplorazione), Terra Mystica (utilizzo di materie prime come fosse l'energia viola), The Golden Age (sviluppo tecnologie, anche graficamente). Il gioco inoltre perde di mordente vista la scarsissima interazione e il fatto che il gioco consista in un solitarione di programmazione. Potrei essere smentito ma secondo me tra un paio d'anni il gioco sarà caduto nel dimenticatoio.

This is a great space game. Unfortunately my friends doesn't like it as much as I do. 

I really like the implementation of limited resources and the handling of that, even if some have a problem with the thematics of it. 

The Objective cards are a little to similar. I'd like to see different objectives with different difficulty and maybe have two or three each to choose from. Now it's just forcing you into a certain strategy. Everyone gets their 5points or they won't compete for the win. We have experimented with one standard and one advanced goal and then either fulfil both, or have to discard one after a certain number of rounds.

Kepler-3042 is a space exploration game, where players build ships, colonize planets, and use those planets to produce resources (a little like Starfarers of Catan). It's a game where you start out being able to do very little, but as the game progresses, it snowballs a bit. Definitely felt like an optimization game--there was a correct order to do things in that didn't become apparent until after you already did something else. Wasn't a huge fan of the random event cards; these typically just helped someone who was doing poorly. On the whole, I wasn't blown away or anything, but I thought it was a very interesting game.

A bit more rules than I wanted, but by Round 7/16, we were all engaged and interested in the outcome of the game. I wish the designers had found a way to show the actions and tech chart in a more integrated way to make it easier to figure out how to take the desired action while learning the game, but I can see this confusion being less of a factor after a couple plays.

RATING: 7.2
Score after 1st play. Lots of potential. Rules aren't really clear; I feel the language barrier (Italian?) is the source of some of the ambiguity. 

It's a game filled with difficult decisions, and you have a capped amount of turns and options. The trick is to optimise your entire run to the finish as much as possible. A real brainburner, in the style of Terra Mystica. 

In terms of theme, this game gets a solid 8+. It has the right focus on science, without losing the more fantastic elements of sci-fi.

Sleek design brought down by some really drab art. A bit concerned about replayability. Gllad to see some effort went into solo play. This is a friendly game (no combat or other nastiness).

First impressions are positive!

RATING: 7.3
tl;dr: my kind of game!

A pure euro with a space them? Bring it on! I love it when space exploration games are more about exploration and colonising than about space battles. And there's none of that! So far, so good.
The game needs to be interesting of course and this game tries that by a 3x3 grid of actions. Next to each row and column are pictured bonus actions you can take when doing an action in that row or column. Those don't come cheap though as you have to burn one of your resource cubes to perform them, and your supply of cubes is VERY limited.
So the action system is pretty cool and the limited cube pool does force you to clearly plan every single action.
So yeah, I liked this quite a lot when I tried it. I wonder what different strategies are there to be explored, which is why I don't give it an even higher score.
During my play on Sunday at Spiel, I suddenly got up, wondering how many they had left. I was just in time and actually snatched the last copy! 3 other people in my group where disappointed as they also wanted a copy. At least they can play mine :)

RATING: N/A
Personally, I would compare the weight of Kepler to that of games like Tzolk'in, and in some ways, both games gave me more or less the same feeling. I say that because Kepler seems daunting at first when you look at the board, the planet player aid and all of the actions and upgrades you can do. But once you start, you'll find that the rules are not that complex but that strategic thinking is vital in this game. 

Kepler is a resource management game in which you only have 16 rounds/actions, so you need to have good strategy and timing, especially towards the end when things get confusing fast because you're swapping resources and moving them around between your different planets. For a relatively unpopular Kickstarter game, Kepler feels like a finished product and is mechanically very solid.

RATING: N/A
Thinky strategy space 3X to explore, colonize, terraform, and exploit the modular planets in the hex grid Milky Way.  Lots of scoring objectives make focused strategy decisions important but difficult with temptation of interesting tech tree options and distracting event card bonuses for leaders and laggards.  Interesting resource management of recycling energy, carbon, and anti-matter.  I like how the 3x3 action grid determines an optional row/column bonus action and the planning to coordinate these actions.  I like the short term vs long term tradeoff of depleting your resource pool for the bonus actions.

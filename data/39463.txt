RATING: 6
I first played Cosmic Encounter sometime in the 80’s. My recollection is that it was ok but not really my type of game – a bit light, too chaotic and random. Twenty years later, having now played the FF version my conclusion is that the game is a bit light, too chaotic and random. However, the variety in the alien powers do make it interesting and worth the occasional spin

RATING: 8.7
Achieves what Diplomacy fails to achieve : bluff and backstabs with no hard feelings and a lot of laughter.

Really awsome game.

RATING: 1
Never before have I played a game where so little of the game created a narrative/story, I had so little choice in what I could do, yet was dumped on so much (and still won). I often found myself having cards leeched out of my hands by others, but no opportunity to draw new cards, participate in encounters, or even the simple consolation prize of choosing who to target for retribution when it was my turn. There is nothing that would make me play this again.

RATING: 9
I really enjoy this game, and it hits most of my hot buttons in a board game: loads of player interaction, zero downtime, endless variety. The only problem is that it doesn't work as a 2 player game, and really best when it's 5 (or more, if you have the expansions), so that limits how often this hits the table.

UPDATED 6-16-14: Bumped to a 10, and I'm not sure why it took me this long to do so. There is nothing I dislike about this game, I always am up to play it, and there are few in our gaming group who aren't just as excited to play this anytime we get a chance.


UPDATED 7-13-16: Dropped to a 9. I still love it, but I can just never get it to the table anymore. Is it still a 10 if no one will play it with you?

RATING: 6.5
After 1st play: Wow, this is my fav game!
After 2nd play: It was fun but it took way too long thanks to my power which drew me endless trucks of cards.
After 3rd play: Boringish. Felt like going through the motions.

Hesitant to play it the fourth time.

One of my new favourite games, this has so many interesting and involved mechanisms that just drag me into this world and want to play with the bluffing and alliance-making of Cosmic.

The aliens are all highly varied, and have a load of interesting ways to play and changes to existing rules, which really do stop games getting dull.

100% recommendation!

So good my friend wanted to go out and buy a copy after the first play. If only he'd have people to play it with, so he stopped asking me how much my copy went for.

To truly rate this game it must be played with five people who have journeyed together, leart the mechanics, delved into the games deeper innards, and never being certain who will punish you the most for your backstabbing in the next game. Though I have only played with four players *meeep* : (

100303 Played at a con and had quite a bit of fun.  Obviously the players in the game make a big difference...but it was fun to know that even though one of the players stole half the deck (due to the filtch powers - and well played =)  there were multiple opportunities to win in the next few rounds.  The only reason he shared victory with another player is because the other player wanted to move on...

Played once a long time ago -- finally tracked down my own copy, and I'm eager to give this one a whirl. I adore the negotiation inherent to games like [thing=30645][/thing], and Cosmic is the grandaddy of all that. I would love to get the same rich experiences out of Cosmic that I have out of Tammany. As it is, it's just very high on my want-to-play list.

What a fantastic game! It's one of those games where you attack with your dudes to take your opponents' spaces, but you cannot specifically choose the person you can attack or negotiate with on your turn, and each player has a totally game-breaking special power. Really fun game; some of its best elements are:
-It plays in about an hour.
-Easy rules; anybody can learn it.
-Every game will be totally different with the large variety in player powers and flares.
-Interaction between players is the heart and soul of the game.
-Really crazy stuff that seems broken, but surprises you with the ways it can be both used and countered by creative players.

Always different, always chaotic, always fun... even for the kids. Our eight year-old here recently went on an eight-game undefeated streak... in spite of everyone's best intentions to "bring him down." He still won. ;)

Stuff like that makes any game an instant win for me.

UPDATE: This game gets better every time I play it, regardless of the outcome. CC is simply "awesome" in a box.

Favorite game hands down.  Has all the elements to make player interaction hilarious, cut throat without being too mean, bluffing, laughing, crazy rule breaking.. without being imbalanced. Seriously, every game we think there is a guy who is going to win b/c his power is so overpowered, but it never works that way.. some sneaky person will work their way to a victory through subterfuge.    We pull this game out almost every other play group session.. With over 40 games that I absolutely love to play that is saying a ton! The most replay-ability of any game, add a rule, variant etc and the game still works.

With the abudnance of alien races, flares and card combinations truly anything is possible in this game. The offensive/defensive alliances always creates a fun competative atmosphere for trash talking. I love that an 'encounter' is forced every turn with the destiny deck, it keep the pace of the game going. While "unbalanced" doesn't even begin to describe this game, it forces you to ally with others and use your cards as best as you can to make up for it, it is a super well polished and fun game.

First played in the 1980's. It's a classic for a reason, simply epic fun. In space, everyone will hear you laugh!
People say you must have the "right group" but that is basically true with any game right? BUT!!! What I think they mean is that the "10" out of this game is when you have a group of players that really get into what this game is all about: negotiation and variable player powers. One of the player can be an alien race that seems to have a power FAR better than everyone else's in the game, so it's up to everyone else to negotiate their way into victory and overcome the challenge of the other alien powers.... then again that's the cool thing... that's EVERY game. Every game is you and your alien power(s) trying to out negotiate and maneuver everyone else so that you can be the first to gain 5 foreign colonies.

RATING: 8
This game is 3/5's bluffing, 1/5's negotiation, and 1/5's random number generator.  Which doesn't sound so bad, but I've seen a few games where a player's opening hand was so poor, that he had no chance of winning.  

Cosmic Encounter is still entertaining with all the posturing and the ingenious tie-breaker solution, but the mechanisms can definitely feel contrived at times.

I own 4/5 expansions as of 2014.

A study in chaos theory. At first glance it may seem like an unpredictable and disorganized mess. However, there is a measure of order in the chaos in this game.

No two games are ever the same. Seriously. Never. Make alliances, break alliances, fake alliances - it is just so easy to enjoy this game. So much of what makes CE great is the fact that strategies and mechanics abound, yet they feel so organic and are never pushed upon the players. You can have all of the RPG fun of being a character, complete with lawful, chaotic, and neutral, good, evil, and true, without the game spelling it all out for you. Be who you want to be! Play how you want to play! Every player will have a chance to compete and win, whether you like battle, negotiating, or trickery. Quite possibly the best game ever, but not a perfect game; sometimes the chaos can be a bit much and create unnecessarily long or frustrating games. However, the highs outweigh the lows and no other board game is quite as thrilling.

Se sale! Juego muy distendido y divertido, de mecánicas primarias sin pretensiones, con multitud de poderes variables de los aliens, tecnologías... De los mejores de puteo y de la categoría "Pierde amigos" jejeje Consigue con tu raza alienígena colonias en los plantetas de las otras razas de los otros jugadores. Es un juego muy sencillo pero muy muuuuy variado, pues tienes alienígenas, cada uno con su poder especial que rompe las reglas básicas del juego, y hay muchísimos, yo recomiendo la variante que en cada turno que te toque de nuevo, escoger una nueva raza y elegir si quedarte con ella o con la que ya tenías. Con las expansiones pueden jugar hasta 6 o 7, y meten más variedad que ya es decir

This game gets pretty highly rated in places and I really want to play it more often. So far though, it hasn't proved that popular with most people I've played it with. I think a lot depends on what people are expecting the game to be and how willing to engage in diplomacy they are. This is in no way a balanced strategy game, which seems to be what most people expect.

Light game, but fun.  I'm not usually a fan of take-that games, but this one is light and quick enough that it's not a turn off, plus the destiny deck makes it less personal.

Still too early to pass judgement on this one, except to say a few things.

First, it's easy to see why this is a timeless classic;  I won't say it's a great game yet, but it's definitely fun.  

Second, it's claimed several of our favorite gaming moments so far.  My 5-yo got some alien power that allowed him to swap attack cards.  This became TERRIFIC fun because at first everyone realized he was always going to swap. About half-way thru the game, though, he got wise to this and stopped swapping altogether.  By the end of the game, you just couldn't tell whether he was going to swap or not, and the outcome of the game came down to me guessing whether he would.  We were all laughing hysterically.  

That's what gaming is all about.

Maybe I should give this one another try, but the destiny deck makes it all feel so random.  I don't feel like I'm in control of my actions, and it's no fun to get rock-paper-scissored by another race that has a perfect counter to your ability.  Am I missing something here?

Bumping down from a 5 to a 4.  Each time I play this game, I like it less.  I'm becoming convinced that there really is nothing here.

Okay if you like pure negotiation games with a hint of luck but ultimately you need to backstab at the right time to win which is not my playstyle, I don't think diplomacy/negotiation should be about lying through your teeth, I would prefer a game like Poker for that aspect where it's subtle and based on probabilities not just human emotion.

I've played Cosmic since the Mayfair edition and just keep coming back for more.  The chance to play a power I've never played before (or at least a combination I haven't seen) is compelling.  The game itself is simple and easy to teach, the aliens create all the complexity and you'll only see 4-5 in each game.  This game will never get stale.

I recommend the expansions for the additional alien powers, but Incursion is really the only must have.  The defense deck is just too great an addition to pass up.

First play - 5 of us, with no one having any previous experience. It was definitely a learning experience, but was a good first play. 2 guys decided to go together for a combined victory.

good fun.  interesting powers.  I like that the rules are relatively basic, but all the powers break the rules, so it becomes more a game to out play / negotiate the other players.


I thought about it some more on why this is a much better game than say something like munchkin or any get to x amount of points, scramble to the top style game.


Although the main core game is the same, the alien power interaction makes each game unique.  There's some potential for a dud experience but generally the way the different combination play out will blow your mind.

Where as the other games tend to always be the same.

Very interesting and wildly swingy (not like that, this isn't the 70's) gameplay.  Definitely not a serious game due to the sheer chaos that ensues, but it was a fun experience.  A bit too long, though, with 3 players, unless you just let someone win when the novelty wears off.

Felt like it went too long, where it wasn't very enjoyable at the end but players were unwilling to surrender, and I wouldn't need to own this.

This game is purely based off player interaction.  If you think the mechanics carry games, this is not for you.  If you love playing with friends and they are the reason games are fun, this is for you!

RATING: 9
A good game that is amazing in the fact that the balance between the luck aspect of the draw and the strategy seems really tight. That being said the different race's powers and the subsequent player interactions due to it is where the game is at and they seem balanced. They create such unique conversations and even ones where you might want to lose to win or just say that to betray someone. 
Downside is the lucky draw of encounter and destiny cards can win someone the game (A more rare situation than you might think, as everyone can be involved in fights) and if all are playing the game straight up without lying, it will not live up to its potential of fun. That being said overall, I can't think of a game that is similar to a collection like Cosmic Encounter. I would def. seek out a copy if it were not for the fact everyone I play with has a copy with expansions.

OH WOW!  I've played it only once, so I cannot yet say I will always want to play it.  However, between the base game and everything people have added to it, I know I have only just scratched the surface (any more variety, and I'd say this game crosses the line to becoming a game system).  I have not had this much fun interacting with other game players in a very long time, and I am confident it can only get better.  This sets the bar for all other variable strength games in my book.  I recommend you read the reviews of more experienced players for all the reasons this is such a good game.  The FF bits, BTW, are a hair's breath from perfection.

RATING: 9.5
This is my favorite game of all time.  It's not my most played game, it's not the most complex game I've ever played (nor the simplest), it doesn't have the most expansions or varieties, it is not the first board game I liked or got addicted to, it's not in my favorite game genre, and I don't even own it (because several others in my board game group do).  However, this game just does it right.  There's a great mix of luck and skill and it is one of those games that always gets everybody talking and excited.  Different races have different strategies (sometimes completely opposite one another), there's a small hint of hidden role in the beginning because races are not revealed immediately which makes for some fun, and the game can be incredibly fast or fairly long (I have had a game end in under 10 minutes and a game that lasted over 2 hours).  The scoring system almost always allows everyone to see who is winning and work together to level the playing field and the races are very well balanced despite having crazy powers that change the game a ton.  Additionally, multiple people can win a single game.  Only one person has won almost every time I have played and only occasionally do two players win and even more rarely do three (or more) players share their victory though technically everyone can win.  Maybe I still do need a copy for myself...you know, just in case.

It's all about negotiation.  And that means you'll conspire against your friends and/or they'll conspire against you and that's how the game is won/lost.  And that pisses me off.  The utter lack of control, as is inherent to this alliance-driven game, is not my thing.  Which means this one isn't for me.  Still, a fantastic game for what it does and if it is your thing, you'd be a fool to pass this one up.

One game so far.  Lots of fun, surprisingly reminiscent of Munchkin with the emphasis on alliances.  Great components, although the game is so simple that you could play with pencil and paper in place of the planets and ships.  Looking forward to playing more, we've only used the green-level aliens so far.

This game have the same Munchkin downtime problem of the Bash the Leader, but it is a lot more fun and dynamic. I enjoyed it, but this kind of game must not last more than one hour, in my first game, an unpleased combination of cards made this last two hours.

A simple negotiation game that eventually boils down to everyone hitting the leader or everyone has 4 and going in for that last round. Everyone knows about that. 

Plenty of factions to choose from and rules bending powers, are probably the only saving grace about this game.

My favorite game by far! I love the socially imbued chaos that defines the experience. I understand that people who like control and don't want bluffing/backstabbing/lying in their game, but that is what makes it so much fun to play (as long as you are playing with the right people).

This is the only game I've rated a 10. Cosmic Encounter was my "gateway game". Being able to play with 5 right out of the box is a huge plus for me. 50 aliens and spinny ships are even better. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Gets kind of dull after a couple of games in a row. Some of the alien powers seem too fiddly for what this game is. The game lasts longer than it feels like it should. Losing your power sucks and I'm surprised something like that is in a modern edition.

The fun part of this game is seeing how your power works and you get that out of the way in the first two turns. Lots of the decisions feel automatic, because they are. 

Criticisms of the imbalance and randomness of this game are often countered by claiming it's a negotiation game. The card variance destroys this argument. You can call all the allies you want to help you fight the person with the perceived best power, or with the best board position, and then that person plays the 40. It's a hand management game with very few hand management mechanisms. If you collude with other players to take colonies with each other or otherwise use Negotiates to mutual benefit, then whichever one of you draws a better hand will win. If that's you, great. If it's the other player, you're a sucker. Cosmic Encounter is really a gambling game, making deals with other players in the hopes that the random number generator will spit you a favorable result. It is much like Monopoly in this regard.

With a non-batshit deck distribution, more hand management mechanics, and a shorter playtime this might be a good game.

A major factor contributing to the excessive playtime is the bash-the-leader syndrome that plagues so many designs. 

Basically if this were filler I'd enjoy it but it's too long for how random and dull it can be. I actually like the card+ships resolution mechanism but the deck distribution is pretty stupid.

Motto: The rules are not the game

A strange game indeed, as a simple numerical superiority game (ships + card values) gets turned into a melting pot of powers, backstabbing and leader bashing by the addition of no less than 50 available aliens whose powers break the rules in fundamental ways.

The best thing is seeing how they interact (Virus vs Antimatter, anyone?) and the feeling of bluffing your opponents into helping you to a victory.

I can't see myself ever getting bored of it.

12/2017

I was right - I have never got bored. We play every Lobstercon and while my copy has not even been open for years, the love has not died away.
I still miss playing without flares occasionally as sometimes the "bullshit" level increases over my tolerance threshold.

Sure some of the aliens can be just grossly overpowered in some games but it's all part of the fun and incredible variety this game has. Infinitely replayable and it'll never be the same twice. I love the tech addition to the game. The mix of expansion rules and new additions to the FFG version makes a nice combination, it feels like you are buying more game in this version than with other base versions of CE. Can't wait for the sure to arrive expansions.

As advertised: "a game of infinite possibilities".  Feels fresh after repeat plays because of the large variation and interaction between alien races.  Little downtime.  Conflicts, but because of the destiny deck nobody gets picked on.  Fluid alliances over the course of the game are fun.

This is just about the greatest game out there.  It's a hand management game with a very strong social/bluffing aspect, but what makes it so entertaining is the "take that" element where a few cards can completely upend the game.  I haven't come close to playing all the aliens involved, but I look forward to going through them all in a game that I will keep for life.

Update: there's too many aliens. At least half of them are unnecessarily complex or just too strained of an idea.  I'll be chopping my deck down to avoid the stink bombs that get in the way of the gameplay.

Pros
- Crazy amount of alien combinations
- Simultaneous action, negotiation, lying, direct interaction, bluffing, double bluffing, etc. 
- Shared wins is a crazy concept and changes the game
- Stealing cards from other people
- Customize the game to however you want to play it
- Great moments and laughter
- Expansions do not complexity, but variety
- The Anti-Multi Player Solitare

Cons
- Need at least 4 players
- Some aliens/flares have a lot of text to read, but once you get it, it becomes easy
- Some nuances have to be learned, but nothing major

For a light game this is almost disgustingly deep. The brilliance is in its simplicity, but that simple structure gets perverted in some very interesting ways.

My group specializes in medium-to-heavy weight euros, and most Ameritrash titles (especially older titles) sink like lead upon introduction. Though it took a game or two for people to get their heads around it, Cosmic won everybody over by our second play. People were laughing and threatening, losing powers and backstabbing as the hours just flew by. 

My only criticism is the core game-play definitely shows its age (and the math can be tricky after a few beers, especially with some of the more calculation heavy aliens). However, these criticisms are relatively minor and wouldn't affect my desire to ever play the game. 

The mere fact that the game includes 50 aliens and (essentially) 100 types of flares makes for some insane replayability (rivaled only by such laudable titles as Agricola). What's even better is that the game isn't even made by the powers *but rather the   interaction of all the powers present at the table.* This subtle distinction makes every game, even games where you replay aliens, very unique. This also is chiefly why it is getting a 10 and I'd always be up for a game.

Just didn't do it for me.  It was fun once or twice, but the more we started getting into the meat of the game the less I enjoyed it.  It's like a table talk / negotiation game that goes to great lengths to make the negotiation really unbalanced and adds a lot of sometimes needless rules baggage in terms of abilities to remember and Flair cards.

Meh.

3-5(5)

For a game seemingly so straight-forward, there are multitudes of tricky rules and cases to consider. I guess that's what FFG does. The powers are interesting, but clearly imbalanced (the group's play, I guess, is meant to balance this). Some powers are fun and some are cumbersome. 

Nice interaction, and a bunch of diplomacy-type stuff. It feels like it can go long, without a whole lot of strategy. Not my favorite, but would play well with certain groups.

I also own the Avalon Hill version of this game as well.  Since this will allow more than 4 players I figured there might be a better chance of it hitting the table.

The better components, the extra rules and the just the volume of races available makes this the far superior version of the game.  I'm glad I picked it up!

Played first with no aliens and no flares to teach the family. Everyone from 9 to 40 caught on quickly, so I ran through a couple of Alien powers and then assigned them randomly.

RATING: 7.5
Here's what I imagine the design process for Cosmic Encounter was: "Let's make a basic negotiation game, but let's give everyone a super broken cool power that breaks the rules and feels like cheating." "Yeah, Bob, but won't that unbalance it?" "Not if everyone gets a power!" And wouldn't you know it? Bob was right. This game is terrific fun.

RATING: 5
Highly chaotic negotiaton game. Very easy to learn and fast to play. No downtime. The FFG version has great components, I really like that the alien ships stack ontop of each other. Many different alien powers for a lot of replayability. The problem is that the game actually plays itself. Not enough options for the players.

Didn't really come together the first time I played at home, but five games in quick succession were great fun at London on Board. Really enjoyed the variety of the different alien races. Lots of conflict but you don't usually decide whom to attack, so that makes it a little friendlier. Played since, though, and didn't really grab me: needs the right group in the right mood I think.

Even without the numerous expansions this game has near infinite replayability.  By far the best negotiation game I've ever played, and despite the theme is fairly easy to get people in to who wouldn't normally go for 'space conquest'-type games.  Always especially fun at social gatherings.  Even though I gave this an 8 I believe this is essential to any collection as the best example of its niche.

RATING: 6.8
I don't rate this any higher because all too many games have multiple winners.  A single player can win, but it behooves one to gain as many allies as possible at the end game.

The special-ability race cards are terrific, giving a secondary ability if that isn't your particular race and a super ability if it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Plenty of interaction, negotiation, persuasion, and convincing going on between the players. Quite a chaotic game which can be really fun for a change. Invite allies to help you or lure them to share the defeat with you. It is quite a challenge finding the balance between the alien powers that each player possesses so that you could steer yourself to victory. And in the end it doesn't matter so much even if you didn't win because it was just so much fun play the game. However, people who don't like chaotic (and loud) games should avoid this one, for this definitely is chaotic.

For this to work well you do need at least 4 players willing to trash talk, play tricks on each other, and enjoy the negotiation and bluffing.

Components are great. Rules are clear. Expansions are great for alien variety.

This game focuses more on fun and presenting different interactions every time you play. You should not consider this game if you have players unwilling to let their win or lose be determined by luck. There is no strategy in this game, since the end game outcome is luck based. There is tactics and pulling combos, negotiations, and surprising each other out in battles. The journey is good, the end destination is bad if you like skill to matter.

This game always ends in either one player getting bored and sabotaging the whole experience for everyone or most players stacking to 4 then allying with the attacker for a joint win. You should only consider buying and playing this game if everyone is on board with those requirements.

Funny game with lots of Chrome. Feels like a mix of Munchkin and a war game, but I don't mind.

It removes two of the standard flaws of war games by: 1) Not letting you chose who to attack (cards will decide that) 2) Making it possible for your opponent to win territory without you losing it.

Best game of 2009 so far (June 2009).

I’ve just bought this game, haven’t had a chance to play it yet. I hope my group gets into the spirit of it. My partner is the table/trash talker so I’m hoping she makes this game work. 

Update: Played my first game - a three player learning game (not ideal I know) without flares and just the green aliens. Still I found it interesting and so did my group. I think with more players and adding in the flares and new aliens etc the game will only improve. I’m very pleased with this game so far.

Cosmic Encounter is a fantastic game of diplomacy and asset management. The main game loop is simple to understand. New players can start the game after a 25 minute introduction. The aliens, however, give each game a distinct feeling and that is where the game shines. Even using only the base game aliens, there are lots of special powers and flare cards to explore and interactions to experience between players.

Players will need a certain amount of luck regarding card draw, but almost every bad situation and terrible hand in Cosmic Encounter could be manipulated and turned into an advantage with smart play. Social skills are also a necessity, as you've to talk your friends into supporting you and not your opponent. This game is not for people who doesn't like table talk in board games.

If you like big games with social aspects, if you commonly have a 5-6 player table at your game nights, if you always play a game at least a few times before judging randomness factors in it, this might be the go-to game for your gaming group.

The cornerstone of my collection.

A chaotic game which actively demands and evokes player interaction.  

Has an easy to understand rulebook along with some very functional and clearly labeled components which further aid in smoothing game play along.

Play is comprised of both hand management and negotiation.  And while card draws may be lucky and random, winning and advancing is usually resolved through the clever use of special abilities and out-thinking one's opponents.  

Overall a great sci-fi themed game whose random nature blends together well and works to create a fun, fresh, and memorable game experience through each play.

In a way it reminds me the randomness of Munchkin (game i don't like). But here deals and deception makes the game enjoyable. EDIT: don't play with more than 5, there is a HUGE chance someone at the table is going to be unlucky and that person is not going to enjoy the game; more people you have more will fall in this situation.

Too much chaos/jockying/negotiation in addition to asymmetric powers.  Call me a purist, but if I want to negotiate, I'll play Chinatown.  

Primary problem is that the leader will be bashed, then another leader will crop up, and they will be bashed.  Eventually everyone is at 4 points and then someone will win.  Not very fun to just try and bash the leader the entire game (whomever it may be).

I've been looking forward to getting to play this for a long time.  I discovered Cosmic Encounter online before I knew it was a board game and before I even got into the hobby.  It's a ton of fun, and I think the best part is the negotiation - trying to convince others to ally.  The variable powers are great, and the play is quite entertaining.  Even if it's not your turn, there's plenty of opportunity to get engaged.  A wonderful game.

Saying "may the best player win!" prior to a game of CE makes about as much sense as building a wood-burning stove out of paper.  

The outcome of the game is totally irrelevant, but getting there is a zany thrill ride with LOTS of hilarious moments and unexpected upsets, and this type of emergent humor never gets old (unlike, for example, Munchkin gags, etc).  Some of our group's wildest and fondest gaming stories have came from CE.

This game is simple, but very layered. The variance of aliens is very awesome. Even without expansions, this is a very substantial game. The components are awesome. Other games that have come before and after cosmic encounters have tried to declare themselves as a game of negotiation and tenuous deal-making, but this game is the real deal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This game is absolutely fantastic, but I've realized that it really is a gamer's game. More specifically, it's the kind of game that fans of studying game design will get a kick out of as every single alien species breaks the rules and reshapes them for an entirely new experience.

The game is absurd and takes itself only as seriously as the players feel like taking it. There's MANY expansions and variants ensuring that every play is a drastically different experience while still building on the core mechanics of negotiation and bluffing.

11/2517:  Not a lot of meaningful decisions, but at least it's not munchkin.  Not a game that I'd suggest, but less painful than some other games.  And when you have 5 or 6 light gamers, this is definitely an alternative.

08/16/14: Finally played a game of this that I enjoyed.  It's one of the games that you play for the experience, without regard to whether or not you're going to win.  One of the games to be considered when playing with a large number of players.

12/16/2010: Plays in a surprisingly short time, about 1 hour per game.  Maybe this will change as I get more experience with the game, but it feels very tactical, maybe a little too much for my personal style.  I think this may be my way of saying that this isn't my style of game.  However the unique powers and how they interact are a hoot.

Very nice bits, probably the best so far.  A game obviously destined for (multiple) expansions.  One of my friends who has had experience with the Mayfair and Avalon Hill versions of this game said that he prefers the Mayfair edition, at least until the expansions come out.

RATING: 4
This game gets a few point for the utter chaos it can be. Dozens of card and race powers and each and every one of them looks "too strong" if you look it solitarily. Also, the ship moving and alliances are fun if you just ignore the fact the encounters are mostly defined by the luck of the draw.

But: Unless you play with very, very experienced players or a small group, the game probably ends before some players get more than two or three turns. And that is in two hours. Yes, there is some minor interaction with alliances, but in the end, if you get unlucky, you never get to actually *play* this. My guess is to remove the inverse play order cards to help this a bit, but it is an inherent problem of the game for which I can't see any solution.

Much better than the previous Avalon Hill edition.  I still don't like that everyone eventually gangs up on the player(s) with four planets, thus the 8 rating.  Fortunately, everything else, from the updated rules to the artwork to the new technology cards, is golden.

Update: Not as enamored with CE as before.  The randomness and late-game alliances to stop the leading player seem to happen game after game after game.  For a game with as much variety as CE, it's getting a little too predictable despite all the cool alien powers.

The best game. It's fun to teach - a walkthrough of a round of the game is pretty much what players need to know, and guiding through that is almost like playing the game!

I like how it's a game of player diplomacy, game-breaking alien powers, *and* the central importance of managing your hand to win encounters that matter. Almost every game I play ends in some type of shared victory, and with the people I play with, that's a pretty significant plus.

This game is a great example of strategic thought mixed with a dose of healthy chaos.

I think this game has a lot of potential - it's fairly easy and seems to have some pretty deep strategy, but I think a big point that it fails on is that it has a hidden curve for beginners... that is, a beginner doesn't know what all the powers do, so can't guard for every eventuality, or even know what might be good or bad plays to begin with. 

Other than that, my limited exposure to the game makes it SEEM a bit too simplistic for my tastes, but that's why I've got it's score where it is. I've heard such great things about it, it must be good... I just haven't seen it yet.

I'll definitely play it again and give it a few more chances.

----

After playing it a second time, it gets a full 7... The second game was just too enjoyable with too much backstabbing and excitement to keep it in the 5 range. Will definitely be playing this again!

----

Given my entire lack of excitement for playing it any time it comes out, moving this back to 5. It's decidedly average, and will play when I'm in the mood.

Great planetary domination game with simple rules that are completely destroyed by each races special ability.

Game is greatly variable and strategies must adapt to the different alien races powers.

competitive game play centers on attacking other players and taking their planets but the destiny deck chooses who you attack which prevents dog pilling & hard feelings between players.

Cons: There are 2 useless races you should really just never play with, they are awful.

RATING: 5.5
Owned but never got round to playing the Games Workshop version.  Maybe I don't need to now.  The graphics on this Fantasy Flight version appear much superior and the game basically the same.  Mercifully the loosing player invited the player in the lead to join an attack and the game ended after an hour or so in a rather unsatisfactory manner.  Would play again if asked, but would not choose the game myself.  Nice to have finally played this classic, although it feels very dated.

Seems like you need A) the right crowd and B) some experienced players.

If your group wants to "play it straight" and doesn't relish the opportunity to negotiate and manipulate, it will likely fall flat.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Must be played with the right people. It has a bit of luck involved (drawing cards) and lots of chaos (diferent interactions between players powers). Allying with someone is almost always a risk, but also an easy way to get more colonies, still you can mitigate the luck by watching how many cards a player is holding, because that will limit (almost always) their playing, and if you have reinforcement cards or artifact cards you can even change the outcome of the encounter.
The alien's interactions are a blast! 50 aliens in the base set, plus more 60 or so with 3 more expansions.

Nagyon különleges játék, vannak részei, amik semmihez se hasonlítanak az eddig próbáltak közül! Egyhuzamban játszottunk 5 partit... A 4-5-diknél kezdtem érezni, hogy ez valami nagyon élvezetes, nagyon eredeti dolog. 30+ éves játék (mármint az eredeti) és ma is megállja bőven a helyét szerintem! 
A szabály maga egyszerű: Mindenki 5 bolygóval indul, és a többiek bolygóin kell megtelepedni. Minden körben csatázunk. A támadó és a védő a két főszereplő, de hogy őket éppen ki támogatja az adott körben, az hektikusan változik. A szövetségesek is bele tudnak szólni a csata alakulásába. Ami zseniális, az a viszonylag egyszerű keretrendszer. 7 lépésből áll egy encounter, és ezek láncolatából áll a játék. A lépések pillanatok alatt megjegyezhetők. Ami az egészet feldobja, az a fajokban rejlő óriási variancia: 50 faj van az alapjátékban, alig került elő 5 játék alatt kétszer ugyanaz. Hihetetlenül változatosak, ötletesek a fajok, teljesen eltérő játékokat generálnak (pl. van amelyik a támadókártyák számait megfordítja, van amelyik mindenkinek megmondja ki legyen a célpont, stb.)! Minden parti elején, amikor ismerkedtünk az új fajunkkal, mindenki úgy állt neki, hogy na ez milyen erős, ezt győzzétek le! És a játékban az a szuper, hogy mindig mindenre van valami ellenszer, és ha a játékosok következetesek, és a legjobbat ütik mindig, akkor elképesztően izgalmas tud lenni a vége. Simán előfordulhat, hogy egy parti során mindenki legalább egyszer nyerés-közelbe kerül, sokszor nüanszokon múlik, hogy a többiek ezt kivédik ... Nem nagyon fordul elő, hogy valaki hosszú időn át teljesen esélytelen a végső győzelemre. 
A kártyákról még nem szóltam: ezek rengeteg finomságot hoznak a játékba, főleg az N és az M betű, de a támadás kártyák nagyságai is nagyon jól el vannak találva (30, 40-es kártya nagyon menő, de bizonyos esetben még egy 00 is jól jöhet). A fajspecifikus kártyák is ötletesek (a képessége változik attól függően, hogy kinél van), és az egyéb spéci kártyák is. Az a pakli is ötletes, ami a célpontot mutatja meg... A játék alapvetése, hogy SOSE MEHETSZ TUTIRA, mindig lehet egy közbeiktatott kártya:)
Ami nem tetszett, az a technológia kártyapakli, szerintem nem sok színt hoz a játékba. A titkos fajok variánst viszont ajánlom mindenkinek!
Elképesztő hogy még 4 kieg is van (én legalábbis ennyiről tudok), ha valaki mindet megveszi, akkor összesen 110 féle faj van a játékban.
Az alapjátékkal átlagosan nekünk bő 2 óra volt egy parti. Nagyon nyelvfüggő játék. Látszólag brutál szerencsefüggő, játszva mégis kiegyensúlyozottnak éreztük, épp azért, mert mindenre van ellenszer.
Még egy pozitív dolog: holtidő nulla!!

RATING: 8
I love playing this game any chance I get (which, unfortunately isn't all that often). So far I haven't been able to figure out a fast way to teach it to new players so the explaining gets a little long but once things get going they really get going. To anyone who complains that the game is too mean-spirited, or that it can wreck friendships, you're playing it wrong. As with Diplomacy, these games challenge the player to pull off aggressive moves WITHOUT pissing anyone off. That's what makes these games so difficult. I'll even go so far as to say this game is educational. Getting good at Cosmic Encounter prepares you for all kinds of socially delicate situations.

Initial Impression: This is a game I wanted to like. Asymmetrical powers, freeform wheeling and dealing, ... everything that sounds good. In the end, I just didn't enjoy my plays of it. I find that being forced to attack certain targets on your turn is too constricting, the races were too chaotic and unbalanced, and you really need the right people to pull off a fun session of this game.

Great thematic negotiation space game with infinite replayability, isn't as cutthroat as it could be because of the Destiny deck, which is a good thing.

I have only been able to play this a couple times so far, but I can already feel the absolutely timeless quality of this game.  I think it is a hallmark game and it just works so well.  The social aspect game in a very freeform structure of a game doesn't seem to make sense until you get into it, and it just flows so well.  Just brilliant design.

RATING: 3
Negotiation games need to walk a fine line for me to like them, and Cosmic is one that doesn't. Each game of Cosmic strongly depends on the players at the table and the player powers that are dealt out. Consequently, some games of Cosmic can be terrible. The negotiation aspect of Cosmic, which helps give the game a more social approach, does nothing to raise this game's rating in my eyes. Unlikely to play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Great strategy, great social interactions, occasional controlled chaos, Cosmic is quite possibly the greatest game ever made. The only knock that I have is that the sci-fi theme can make it difficult to get on the table with non gamers.

RATING: 10
My overall favorite gaming experiences have occurred while playing this game. Cosmic Encounter has everything that I look for in a board game: Strategy, Negotiation, Bluffing, Combat, Special Powers, Epic Moments and enough luck to keep things from getting Scientific.

I know naysayers claim the game offers little strategic depth and that it's basically a luck based game.  However, I think this really depends on how you play the game.  Good bluffers, negotiators, and those who are effective at hand management will most likely find there is a lot of strategy to this game.  I have seen people win an encounter with a negative value attack card just by bluffing the other player into thinking they couldn't possibly win the match (and thus their opponent threw the match with a negotiate card).  

The possibilities are endless, and the powers really make every game different.  What a gem of a game. Hats off to Tom Vasel for being the motivating force for me buying this game!

This is one of my all time favourites. The perfect mix of simplicity and complexity. Unfortunately, I've found that people don't exactly get the complexities. You have to do a little bit of card counting for the game to have a proper challenge. Furthermore, everyone has to make a concerted effort to be the only winner - too often I've found beginners just letting others share their win. With out a devoted group of cutthroats, the game doesn't work as well.

7/17/2015 - (Owned the game for more than four years and have played it through more than 50 times.)

The best game ever! 

In Cosmic Encounter, each player takes on the role of an alien race and competes to establish foreign colonies in other players' systems of planets. Instead of complete domination, a player only needs to establish five foreign colonies to achieve victory.

Each alien race grants a player a unique power which will likely play a part in helping them win the game.

Players take turns invading one another's planets attempting to establish foreign colonies. Players must attack whichever alien race is drawn from the destiny deck. This helps prevent many long term or overpowered alliances between players. However, short term alliances between players will allow them to gain a foreign colony as an offensive ally, or receive cards or space ships as a defensive ally. This mechanic allows for a high level of competitive interaction unlike any game I have ever played!

Cosmic encounter has limitless replayability in that the base game alone comes with 50 different alien races (each with their own flare cards (aka: super/wild alien powers that can be used by whoever has the flare card in their hand regardless of their alien race), the destiny deck, and a deck of cosmic cards full of cool artifacts, lethal attacks, and tactical negotiations. Also, Cosmic Encounter comes with many variant rules such as the technology deck, filled with its investment driven/researchable technologies!

"Cosmic Encounter: The Game of Infinite Possibilities!"

RATING: 6
The negotiation is fun, but it sucks to have an alien whose power can only be used on your turn, because you only get 2-4 turns in a game. So it's mostly bickering it seems. Not sure what to think yet.

I really enjoy Diplomacy, so when I found out that CE had a bit of a Diplomacy flavor, I purchased it with some Christmas money.  I've played it once so far, and I don't really know if that's enough to give it a really reliable rating.  I enjoyed the interaction, the helping the poor, ganging up on the rich, and turning my back on a perceived ally just to further my agenda.  I still need to get more familiar with the cards, the aliens, and the best strategy to conduct.  I hope to play more, hopefully with a full complement of players.  [Gift]

Crazy. Wacky. Get ready to plead with your friends to join your cause.  Coerce, sabotage, back-stab, negotiate, and laughing out loud are all essential aspects of Cosmic Encounter.  The game is deceptively simple, yet that just makes the social aspects of the game, that much more of a focus.  Great game!

RATING: 8
Such a great game BUT it's not for everyone. The game isn't very intuitive despite being rules-light. Valuing what cards are worth and when best to play them, when to ally, etc is not easy for new players. I've found this game plays the best when you don't take it that seriously and just have fun with it. It's got quite a bit of strategy but it's not obvious to new players. Because of the way some aliens appear so powerful (and some really kind of are) and how certain cards are clearly better than others, the game appears to be a huge luck-fest and for a game that takes 1-2 hours that won't be fun for some people. Being put in a conflict where you have little or no hope of winning (which happens often) isn't fun either. There is a factor of luck but it's not nearly as high as it appears. The biggest overlooked factor of the game is the ally system and convincing others to invite you so that you can get an easy foreign colony or get some more cards in your hand. There is so much room for negotiation and backstabbing that is makes the game go from good to great. I can't not mention the true crux of this game which is the alien powers. The sheer amount of variability and variety within the aliens means that no two games will ever play the same and that's just awesome.

RATING: 8
Really cool negotiation game that is so much more. Varied special powers allow for a lot of trickery on the path to victory. No two games are the same, and your strategy won't be either. Alliances will be formed and broken, and the option to have a joint victory with potentially several players in the game keeps you on your toes. The artifact cards, tech, and flare cards take this game from "high card wins" to convincing you that the vitality of an entire race is on the line. Very good stuff.

Have played Cosmic Encounter several times, but I really don't understand what the fuzz is about. The gamepaly is either too random or dull and apparently the fun is had at the negotiations which are not referred to in any way in the rulebook. So all the fun is just based on metagame, not the real deal. This is the game that showed me to be cautious about american game reviewers, as there seems to be some fundamental difference in the gaming styles between continents.

So far this is the only game I would rate a solid 10, and that is purely based on fun factor.  It doesn't matter that the game is unbalance as far as alien powers go, in fact that is part of its charm.  Every single game I've played to date has been a blast.  I think enjoyment of this game has a lot to do with the people you play it with.  Sure Cosmic is chaotic, but the chaos makes for some hilarious moments; the chaos in Cosmic also keeps the game exciting. I can see myself enjoying Cosmic Encounter for many years to come.

This seems like a very hit-or-miss game. The mechanisms are very simple, but the complexity comes in the form of special powers and flare cards. Thankfully you can leave out the flares if you want a more simplified game. Surprisingly this game worked just fine with my family, because they also rank the complexity of the abilities so I could insure that we only use ones they can handle. The problem comes when this game starts to drag. If people start failing consistently on their attacks the game can get way too long, and since each turn is just a rote series of steps the game starts to feel repetitive. I'm sure it's up to the players to keep the game short, but if you aren't winning it's just natural to try holding on so you might have a shot at victory. I'd play again, but I don't know if I'll ever suggest it.

From everything I'd heard, I didn't think I would like this game.  I was right.  Because it seems like such a well known game, I thought it was one I should try once.  So, when I got my chance I played it.  It felt like a luck-filled, king-making fest.  There were lots of special cards and special powers and neat stuff like that, but mostly it was a chaotic luck-fest and that doesn't interest me.  Fortunately, it was a 3 player game and over fast.  I'm glad I tried it once... I don't think I'll play it again.

Normally I write a not so brief rules summary, but I don't think that's possible... I don't know the game well enough as I've only played it three times and the last time was more then a year from when I am typing this. 

It's funny, I am noticing I only comment on games I don't own when I really dislike them. This is not going to be an exception. Both of my plays have been pretty meh, and the second game ended with me having a blow up which I will explain later and writing this game off for dead.

My third, and last ever play took 90-120 minutes and ended with two players sharing a tie. It was like watching a TV show about paint drying. The player who's turn it was flipped up another players card that also had four planets and they just openly agreed to share victory. The rest of the table was helpless and just had to watch it happen. WHY THE HELL DID I JUST WASTE TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE!?! My friend that loves the game, and brought his expansion filled copy over, went to the game's defense;(paraphrased as it's been over a year.)
"You could of played a zap card(I don't remember the actual type he said) which would have let you stop their play."
"So for me to stay in this game I have to hope I draw that specific card?" 
"Well, there are a couple of them, and they could zap your zap."
"So... even if I get lucky enough to draw the card to stop it I still couldn't stop it?" 
"It's possible. But also, one of them could have secretly played an attack card which would have been hilarious."
"But the two players were timid like deers in headlights. Even if one mustered the courage to pull that play out of their bag of trick I played a two hour game to see a moment that'll be funny for two minutes then brand the person that did it burnt for any other negotiations in future games of that?"
"The game is awesome! You have no taste."

There seem to be a thousand expansion, all adding more and more alien factions for you to play as, which you think would be cool, but I just found as tedious. Each one changed game play for that character, but keeping track of who did what, and what helped who, just made what was suppose to be a negotiation game feel like it was being cross bred with a tax form.

Bottomline; I know it's a sacred cow, but it's just a colossal waste of time. It's Munchkin's in space, with neater bits to make people forget how little this "game" has going for it.

Absolutely love this game. Each and every game I play there is always someone in the group that has a "Wait, your alien can do what?!?!" moment, and that is priceless. Would be rated higher if not for some truly awful experiences as well. It seems as though there's not a lot you can do sometimes to mitigate a bad hand (your alien power and your alliances can only take you so far)

At first this game seemed like Munchkin Advanced, but with a few more plays, I'm starting to grasp the strategy and depth that can be found in this game. Definitely enjoy playing. Sometimes it feels like the Cosmic gods are against you, but nevertheless it feels like every game is winnable.

This game is a pretty big hit with almost everyone I've played with! It's easy to understand and explain, all of my games have been less than an hour, and the alien race power and character cards make for some WONDERFUL memories that I will truly never forget.

While I prefer a more complex game, the amount of LOLs had while playing makes this game pretty high within my top 10

RATING: 6
Fun game, but very group dependent. With all the powers, artifacts, and other special cards flying around this game gets very chaotic, but as the game usually plays rather short, the chaos is only fun. If the game was longer the chaos would be more problematic and less fun. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Simple and chaotic, Cosmic Encounter encourages player interaction and rewards those players that both like bluffing and take their risks: in my book, this is the core of any fun game, even though here’s no die to roll.

As soon as I joined my first game, Cosmic Encounter became one of my all-time favourites: somehow it reminds the way another favourite of mine, Wiz-War, plays, since every certainty crumbles and confusion rules when this game hits the table.

Finally played this game and I was pleasantly surprised on how good and fun this was.  I think it's going to be a very group dependant game but the haggling, trash talk, special powers, etc., really make this fun.  My first playing and I had a blast (we had five).  Couldn't really imagine playing with less than five.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
It took me a while to appreciate this game for what it is, in part because I was hung up on how some alien powers were just "better" than others, or how luck of the draw could give you a sucky hand, etc. What I didn't realize at the time was how important negotiation, trickery, and careful cardplay was to this game--especially the first of those.

That said, luck of the draw can be very bad, both with filling your hand and with the destiny deck. Not a perfect game, but one I'll never turn down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Whoa. What a big game. It can be a little obnoxious with often you are feeling helpless and the assymetric player cards of alien races really dictate the game. While this is great for replayability it is hard on new players. Especially since the cards you play are not balanced either - players are meant to balance through diplomacy, but with so few points needed to score it just isn't an elegant system. and LONG to play

This game is great! I recently finally got the newest printing of this game (FFG with Parasite on the cover) and I am very pleased with this purchase. I've had to chance to play a 3 and 5 player game with just the base game. Both games were enjoyable, and both games, the winner ended up being someone who doesn't have a ton of boardgame experience. Everyone so far that's played it in our group has wanted to play it again in the future. Now for the expansions...

Version I learned to play on. First play was disappointing, w new gaming group, just didn't know everyone well enough I think and played too "quiet". 2nd play was at GenCon '11 with Our Gang, what a blast!

RATING: 8
A game all about the interactions you have with other players. Different race cards dramatically affect gameplay and change the game up every time.

How fun this game is really depends on the group you get. I almost dislike games with new players- it ruins the flow, requires re-explaining the rules every combat, and limits the complexity of race cards and interactions. Playing with experienced players and with advanced races completely changes how fun the game is.

RATING: 10
Very fun medium-weight game (and easy to teach). Tons of alien powers to play with making it a different game every single time. This game has gotten tons of plays with many of my friends. 
Plays best around 5 players. 

One downside (not a game design flaw), is that sometimes players freely allow for everyone to ally with them which can really speed up the game. several times games have ended without a full rotation of players (in my 7 player games). On the other hand, game can be dull with too serious of players looking for indepth strategy. Have a good time, but try to backstab too!

This game is totally chaotic, imbalanced and random... but oddly it's what makes it so much fun! The rules are simple: draw a card, have an encounter, place a colony.

This game is a hoot. The powers are all over the place, but the rules themselves are really simple. As a result, I've found this actually makes for a fantastic introductory game, as the rules only take a few minutes, plus another few minutes for explaining each race in play.

I'm always up for a game of this, although the sheer chaos seems to be a turn off for some people.

It's a cliche' to say, but this one depends on your group. If your gaming group is assembled only for that purpose and you wouldn't have a good time with each other anyway, this is not the game for you. However, if your gaming group is genuinely a group of friends, this game will invite you into a rule system which will create a terrific amount of fun. The situations the powers and cards put you in are unpredictable and generate temporary alliances, bluffs, betrayals and triumphant victories. When this hit my usually skeptical game group it produced more laughter, loudness and post game discussion than any other. In truth, almost all of the fun that we had was produced by the emotion and humor we all put in, but no other game is as successful in bringing it out of all of us so well. This is a must have game for a gamer who games with friends.

Definitely a wild ride, but it really stalled out for me. I got out to a big lead in a 6 player game and for the rest of the game, I pretty much sat on the sideline as no player asked me to ally on attack or defense which was lame. By the time the turn got back around (almost an hour later), I was ready for the game to be over no matter who won.

Never a dull game here, and even when things go against you for some reason (bad cards, bad mix of powers on the table) the game doesn't last too long before you can reset and go at it again.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
I keep trying the game to see what the magic is supposed to be...cannot find it yet.  I feel like something is being done wrong.  I really wanted to like it.

The races are just so dang annoying at times.  Sometimes they are ultra powerful, and I find that the majority of the game we are ganging up against someone to try to eliminate the power.  Sometimes they are ultra ridiculous, in that the power they have could make them win any fight by choosing what type of numbers will win.

Then the flare cards may do the same things.  Sometimes a flare card is so powerful that I don't see any way a person could lose with the card, unless they get it zapped.  Sometimes the Wild part of a Flare is better than the actual race.

All in all, I see a game that seems intense that boils down to a random draw of who will get the last turn to get a planet without much of their own skillset having caused the win.

Have played the Avalon Hill edition and Fantasy Flight with Flares.  After one game, I'm not sure the Flares add much more to the game except another element of randomness and timing issues.  I might try just Techs next time.  The funny thing about this game is that the ships mean very little in the battles compared to the cards.  This is only amplified by the rules that state you can only use one to four ships in an encounter.

Pure chaos, lots of fun.  The game can be a little mean (there always seems to be one person who gets picked on by fate).  Also can't go into it too seriously, I don't see how anyone can be a "champion" Cosmic player.  Still though, probably the most fun I've ever had with randomness.

You either love Cosmic Encounter, or you hate it.   If you love confrontation, special powers, sneaky moves, screwing your friends, etc, you should like Cosmic Encounter. 

The major aspect of this game that I adore is the pace.  Most players are engaged on every players turn.   Whether simply as a spectator watch an encounter unfold, as assistance in an encounter, or the main players in an encounter.   There is always lots going on here.  

The Fantasy Flight version of this game is highly produced with detailed ships, gorgeous alien artwork, and high quality boards.   

Cosmic Incursion, and Cosmic Dominion are highly recommended expansions.   The rewards deck is must have in my eyes.

The basic mechanics of the game- confrontations with hidden strength along with alliances and possible promises and backstabbing are fun and I tend to like games that use them.  I like the destiny deck because it forces conflict, prevents ganging up and keeps it from becoming too nasty like diplomacy.  What obviously pushes the game over the top are the alien powers which make every game different and which also make this one the best experiences in all of board gaming.  The sheer amount of the material for this game is nearly overwhelming and makes it infinitely replayable.

Era un juego pendiente de probar porque a nadie deja indiferente. O lo amas o lo odias.. yo no lo odio.. aunque tanto como amarlo... tendría que probarlo algo más. Es un juego de conquista espacial, en el que has de ser el primero en colonizar cinco planetas. Cada jugador posee una raza que le otorga un poder especial.  Mucho puteo y bastante estragia, aunque a corto (inmediato) plazo, puesto que , jugando a cuatro, entre turno  turno pasan demasiadas cosas.
He leido críticas que lo tildan de ser un poco caótico y no les falta razón, porque a pesar de que hay unas reglas básicas, hay multitud de cartas que incluyen variaantes y cosas nuevas. Eso sí, muy alta rejugabilidad

If you go into this game looking for complex strategy, you will be disappointed.  If you go in looking for a fun romp, bluffing and negotiating your way to victory, there are few better.  That said there is definitely strategy in how you align yourself, how you utilize your alien's power and how you choose to play your cards.  This is a game that plays better the more players you add.  Yes, you will probably have few turns but you will be involved in every other player's turn.  Few games have provided me with more laughs with friends that this one.

I like games with good decision making, interesting characters with interesting characteristics, and a good end game with good ways to get VP's. 
This game has none of those.

Every time it comes out I think: Maybe it'll be better this time. Every time I'm wrong.

must try multi-player Fant. Flight version as on Board Games
with Scott (excellent video!).
No dice: it's all hand management and mind-reading!
+++Tom Vasel's favorite, but really requires 3 people.

I like this game a lot. The only problem is that I feel that I have not reached this game full potential. Being a negotiation game, probably it is because it needs to be played with the right kind of people, the treacherous and backstabbing kind of people... and maybe I am not one of them. Maybe you could enjoy it also with a group of players that knows the game very well. Thus far I haven't played it with the same group a lot.

We'll see...

This game inspired Richard Garfield to create Magic: The Gathering, and I can see why. Never has diplomacy and backstabbing ever been so fun and chaotic. The massive number of aliens and multiple combinations of interactions make this game one that I will never get tired of playing.

At first I thought I would love this, but I'm not thrilled about it anymore.

I like that you are not fully in control and that you cannot win on your own just by doing the right moves: you need to convince others to help you a bit here and there, and use bluffing or other tricks to get an advantage out of any deal. Or make an alliance and actually try to win as a team? This is one of the few games where I could actually see this happening. Although you need to accept the mindset where a shared victory is just as good as a solo victory - which doesn't sit well with some competitive minded players.

After some plays I have found that some alien races and some cards are just too dominant, and [i]having[/i] to gang up against them isn't really fun, and since you cannot choose who to attack, or cannot do much with a bad hand, it is often not even possible. A game can be over before some players get the chance to do anything significant.

The rules aren't always clear when it comes to interactions between the races.

It was better than I expected...
...but it still is just negotiating for negotiating's sake. You don't have anything to offer since everybody wants to win without strengthening your enemies that they might be able to sneak victory away from you.
The second big turndown is the total luck dependance. If you draw bad cards? Well bad luck... If your opponents draw good or even mediocre cards, well then you're out. You won't win a fight, you won't be able to block anything from destroying you.
And the worst of all you don't have any chance to mitigate your luck of the draw.

I used to love this game.  (Well, the West End version I used to own.)  And it's pretty, and really a good game -- probably.  But I seem to always play with large groups, and multiple expansions, and double powers, and ... it just seems so bloated.  I'd enjoy playing the base game with 3 or 4, I think, and maybe single powers (although we always played double back in the day.)  I suspect it's just the Epic CE game that falls flat for me.  Maybe some day I'll get a chance to find out.

Update 9/30/2013: Oh boy.  Again with 6 players, double powers.  Two players got turns before the game was over.  The winner hadn't even had a turn.  I MIGHT try this again with single powers, but even a smaller group isn't going to do it for me any more.  I'm not yet revising my rating, because I haven't played a "standard" game, but I'm just not seeing the appeal.

One thing I miss in this version, which was present in the old West End version I used to play: if you drew your own color in the destiny pile/deck, and didn't want to attack your own system, you got to choose a target.  The new version has all sorts of different cards, but few of them allow you any choice, making the game SO chaotic that I sometimes feel it's playing me.  

In this last game, it was over before it began.  One player had Genius and Ethic.  The upshot of this is that he got cards -- lots of them -- all the time, and only needed 20 cards in his hand to win.  We had mostly inexperienced players as well.  Maybe we could have found a way to block him, but the game was over before we had a chance to figure it out.  

Maybe that's fun for someone who's an expert at the game, but it may have put me off for good.  Which makes me sad. I had a lot of fun playing my old version of this game back in the day, and I'm sorry I don't seem to be able to go back.

In [b]Cosmic Encounter[/b], players play different alien races trying to establish colonies on each others' planets.  Each player has a unique special ability to aid them in their conquests.  Some abilities are very powerful, but your opponents may cooperate to prevent you establishing colonies.  Because players can cooperate, tied victories are very common.

I first discovered CE in the 90s.  It has been in print for nearly 40 years, and it is still one of my favourite games.

This and BattleCON are probably my two favorite games right now (despite being so much that I dislike in games). That said, this is not a game I would recommend to everyone. It is not a game I would play with people who have a hard time with conflict/backstabbing/being ganged up on/etc.. It is also very imbalanced at times, which is fine with me because when playing with the right group the imbalances seem to work themselves out (someone with a strong alien being ganged up on, talking your way out of a bad hand).

What a great game. So varied, quite random, very fun negotiation game. Yes, it's a negotiation game, so if no-one negotiates it can be quite boring, but it's a great game for sitting around having a good time. Great conduit game, but a great game in its own right.

RATING: 5
I don't really get this game. Why can't you choose who to attack? It's bizarre. Rather than allowing weaker players to form alliances against more powerful aliens, the game instead turns moments of potential diplomacy into total chaos: you attack someone one turn and then defend them the next. The alien powers are very cool and imaginative, though.

After some initial bad experiences playing Cosmic Encounter, some of my friends keep telling me to give it another try with a decent version (not Avalon Hill).

Love this game.  I'm not always in the mood for a mostly random shouting match, but when I am it's Cosmic Encounter all the way :).  So many interesting interactions between the alien races, I could play this game 100 times and still be finding new things.  That said, the game can drag on a bit, especially with 6 players.  And you really want at least 5 to play, so it has a pretty limited range.  A classic for a reason, though!

This is the first game I have taken the time to rate on here.  There are many games that I enjoy but very few that last within the my gaming circle.  My rating of this game is derived from the quality of the components, the replay-ability of the game, the fun factor with my fellow gamers, and the length of time it takes to play a game.  This is a fun game, its easy to explain (other than a few of the alien races, particularly the ones that involve math, even though the math is far from complicated).  It also works well with a wide range of player number.  The most I have played it with at one time is 8 (using 4 planets each) and the games went fast.

2017 Update:  I still love the variation but there are other games that have lowered this one a bit.

Raucous good time.  The lack of a board and the fact that you can't choose to gang up on another player are the secret to making a multi-player conflict game that doesn't come down to sitting back and trying to get the other players to fight.  The powers and flares make every game different (though there are some dud combos).

This game has so much going for it. It is truly a game of infinite possibilities. No game will ever play the same.

CE is a game I like but don't love.  It's a bit overrated in my opinion, probably because Tom Vasel hypes it and the fact that it isn't strong in terms of long-term development and strategy.

Rated at 8 so far.  Have only had a dry run through to deal with the new rules solo.  One friends said she would be able to try CE again because of the beautiful cards and pieces - that already gives a good score to a game I love but have a hard time finding friends with whom to play.  (Though my brother, 10 year old nephew and 7 year neice are recent converts to the old Eon edition).

Updated 12/29/10.

I played Cosmic Encounter twice this month because it seemed to be one of those ubiquitous, oft-recommended classics that exists just far enough outside of my comfort zone to present a new and engaging challenge, while not so far as to be either completely foreign or an embodiment of the kind of games that I actively despise. The game is widely cited for producing a fun, social experience, which seemed to be what we were after on the day in question. 

In pracitce, the game was less-than-stellar. It presents a relatively simplistic hand management exercise marred by simultaneous action selection and too pronounced card variability. All of this happens in the thematic context of space conquest, but since players must attack on their turn and since targets are chosen at random, conquest is first-and-foremost about card play. By asking players to secretly and simultaneously select the cards to play, the game precludes players from properly valuing the cards in hand. If you're the sort of player who gets a kick out of making a decision in an information vacuum just to see how it turns out, this game might be for you. I'm not that kind of player. Moreover, the range of attack card strengths is too broad to make the decisions of what to play meaningful. That is, the span between the best card in the deck and the best card in your hand at any give moment is likely more than any strength advantage that you can gain through the commitment of ships.

The more intriguing mechanical element of the game mechanic is the alliance mechanism, but that's overshadowed by the ease of negotiations. Negotiations between attacker and defender cut off allies and benefit the negotiating players. In fact, both of my games ended with a negotiated shared victory, which is about as unsatisfactory as it gets. Just let that thought sink in for a second: Both of the games we played ended because the game allows two randomly paired players to decide that they both win. :soblue:

A game of interplanetary invasions, alliances and backstabbing. You'll never play the same game twice.

Another classic that I should have played a lot earlier than this. My friend pulled it out and it was amazing how quickly he explained it. We just fired in to it. He let us know that this whole game is unbalanced and not to worry about it and just play. He was right on both accounts. I managed to mess up what a couple of cards did, but that didn't stop this being a fun game. I don't mind figuring it out as we play this more. It didn't spoil the game for me, or make me think "well if I knew that I would have done something else..." I don;t know if this is an instabuy though, since most of my friends would balk at the backstabbery. 03/01/13

Since writing my initial feelings for the game this has now been bought, along with ALL the expansions and is #3 on my top 10 games of all time.  I just need to get the chance to play it more.  What a wonderful game!  Most people are unsure about the negotiations and the backstabbing. 06/06/14

Sometimes I think this is a great game in search of a gaming group.

When we play with Patricia's cousins, they don't like to fight one another, so they go for negotiation and shared victory a lot. It really made the game dull.

We also had problems with the shortened play variant with four planets per player. The game ended after three players' turns - two players teamed up with one another for two encounters each, scoring four after the third player's turn.

I'm still sure there's a good game here, but I think we need a different group to play it. Maybe the guys up north would work.

The tension seems to revolve mostly around being able to go from four to five colonies. People don't seem to fuss too much about those first four colonies, just that fifth one. Which to me, makes the beginning and end game less than fully exciting. Oh sure, in theory the tension should be all about the actual fighting, with everything else in the game there to support that, but the stakes always just seem so low on colonies one to four (unless you are about to lose your third home planet, that can be rough) and most of the time it's obvious who will win any particular battle.

The alien powers add something fun to the mix, most of the time, although some of them seem near useless or just very dull.

Now, based on what I said in the first sentence, the ending should be the best part of the game, but every game I've played, the winners have been two players who negotiated their way to a shared victory. A very anti-climactic ending.

I got into CE by playing the Mayfair edition, where Flares were a one-time use. Having them go back into your hand after you've played them changes things SIGNIFICANTLY. I have mixed feelings about it.

On the one hand, I find it pretty fun to know that people have certain flares and to try to base your play around them. I also like that, with the 1 flare per turn rule, you're sometimes forced to make difficult decisions about which flare to play. Compared to Mayfair, flares have a much bigger impact on the game and your strategies overall.

On the other hand, it can be quite annoying if someone has a bunch of good flares they can use every turn and you're having a tough time forcing them to discard them.

Overall, though, FFG has done a great job at respecting CE. This is definitely the edition I would recommend any new players. The bits are great, the rules are clear without being overly lengthy, there's a ton of awesome powers, and having explanatory text (instead of symbols and reference cards) on cards such as the destiny deck and negotiation cards makes teaching and learning the game a lot smoother. Also color-coding aliens by complexity is sheer and utter genius and makes teaching this game way better.

Looking forward to more expansions (preferably moon/lucre-free.)

Side note: I can't imagine playing Eon after playing this - seems like keeping flares PLUS playing unlimited flares per turn would make for some really rigged combinations.

Edit: even though it's essentially the same game, I bumped this up and my beloved Mayfair edition down. You can play the flares whichever way you prefer, and the clarity of everything really makes this the definitive version.

A seminal game design. Very fun if not taken too seriously and if everyone enjoys the good natured conflict.  Negotiations and card counting minimize the luck of the draw. More skill involved than meets the eye.  To me it seems that the skill/luck ratio is similar to poker.  In a one time shot, anyone can win but over time, skilled players win considerably more often.

Cosmic Encounter is a great game that takes the right group of people playing it to make it fun. The mechanics of the game allow for very unbalanced races to play each other (on purpose) and left up to the players to balance it out via diplomacy. If you are playing with a mix of gamers and non-gamers, this game will lend itself to being pretty random and not alot of fun. BUT, with a group of people that normally play alot of board games and can identify the stronger players/races quick enough, this game can be incredibly fun. I did not play the versions of this game before this release, but I am glad I gave it a try.

This game is a lot of fun. It's certainly not for the kind of square-jaw who would play Settlers with a deck of dice, but for me the game plays fast enough that I don't mind the chaos. Any game with a card that allows you to cheat is a big winner in my book. Endless cards and alien powers give this huge replayability. Nice.

I don't think I have ever had more fun in a game before. It has such great variability, that I highly doubt this will ever change. This game is not for everyone, but it definitely excels with the right group.

1/3/18: I decided to bump it down from my initial 10 since I know this game is limited by the group, therefore the experience is variable. Also some alien powers extend the game and make it less enjoyable for everyone. I still love this game.

This is probably one of the best games in the world - with the right group. Unfortunately, that group wasn't my group. I had thought it would be a big hit with my group who usually likes take that-elements and a little backstabbing and such, but ultimately the reactions were a bit "it's ok, but not anything special". I liked the various player powers, and while I did like the negotiation aspect I don't think we (trash!)talked enough.

I am sure we would like it more if we got to play it more (and with 5 players instead of 4), but as I own a lot of quality games, we don't want to commit a lot of time/plays to really discover this game. I am definitely willing to play it again (with the same or with different groups), and if it turns out to be a funny experience, I might consider to buy it again.

Typical FFG quality components. Rather chaotic game in which everyone tries to hold back the leader. The negotiation adds an interesting element and makes sneaky wins possible. As in the earlier editions, some powers are very strong indeed.

*6* (Initial Plays)
Felt Chaotic. I really have no idea how to win in this game. Some of the powers felt extremely powerful and made the game feel a little unbalanced. There were some conflicts with the rules, there are lots of cards that break the rules, and unfamiliarity with the cards can make the game feel random. With all that said, I can still see a great game in here with repeated play. It's very interactive and fun, it just needs more play to understand the powers and a strategy. So, I plan to stick with this one and keep playing because I can see this game being great.

This is the first game that I played with my tabletop group. As a lover of all things space, I was pretty excited. When they explained the rules to me, I was a little apprehensive. By the end of the night, I knew that I needed to own a copy of this game.

RATING: 6.5
Chaotic and social driven. It can be fun - but only with the right people. 

This game is not for those who:

- are not confrontational (they will hate this game)
- don't like to scheme, upset friends, or break alliances (they will also hate this game)

The alien powers are intentionally unbalanced - although I am not clear if this is a good game mechanic or just laziness on the part of the designer.

With the right people (who don't hold grudges) this game is fun - and the social element holds everything together.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good fun here with all the different powers and the flare cards.  The Negotiate cards can suck but that makes the game all the more interesting.  The Destiny Deck is definately my favorite mechanic in this game - a way that provides direct confrontation yet completely prevents bashing on the leader or someone you have a grudge against.

Shocked at how much I enjoyed this game, but I think that comes from the wild and crazy powers that each person has that really influence your strategy. Yes the game is random in who you attack, but being able to call for allies and play cards to either battle or negotiate makes for a good social game. My only worry is that because it is a race to 5 colonies someone could continually try to postpone the game end with the right cards and that would lengthen the game and dampen the fun for me. Overall great game if it can be done within an hour and one I'd be willing to play with  a large group.

What can I say. One of the best games ever designed. Plays 4 to even 7 people really well so it's good for scaling groups. The various negotiation tricks you can discover are really interesting. Negotiation feels very pure but the wacky alien powers take it to the next level. It can feel like it's up to the players to "self-balance" but that's really unavoidable given the sheer number of aliens and how they might play off each other with game-breaking results. But that's part of the fun. And hands down one of the best games for producing "remember that one time" stories.

Folks wanted to play this. They promised we'd be done in an hour. I was feeling magnanimous. I played. It has so much I don't like in a game, I don't even know where to start. So I won't.

We finally got this to the table, and I'm not sure I like it yet.  I'll reserve judgement for after another couple plays.  It seemed like you're not really in control of what you can do (ie: few options), and are at the mercy often of others bargains.  I don't mind games with some randomness, but this seems to run a bit long for that type of game.  Variability / re-playability is excellent, however, due to the sheer number of species / powers / combinations.

Great Ameritrash game with tons of cool alien powers.  Your race is basically trying to conquer worlds in other alien races' home systems.

Combat is remarkably simple compared to some other Ameritrashers that I have played.

Sci-fi strategy that seems to lack the depth. The idea behind having alien abilities that bend and break the rules (think Magic the Gathering) has great potential. The issues is the lack of flexibility beyond those individual abilities because their is little to no way to create combination. In other words, if player A has an ability that nullifies player B's ability, for most of the game that will hold true.

This is it. This is my #1 favorite game. I could play this forever and not get tired of it. I probably will play this forever and not get tired of it. This is an intense game of yelling, backstabbing, and wonderfully varied alien powers. It can also be a game of surprising alliances and friendships. The rules are actually rather simple, but the key, the linchpin to this insane, wonderful thing is the destiny deck.

The destiny deck is a deck of cards with colors on them. You draw one at the start of your turn and this dictates who you attack (with a few exceptions). This initially rubbed me the wrong way when reading the rulebook, but it's actually genius, because the crux of the game isn't planning the perfect strategy. It's not having the right combination of attack or defense or "gotcha" cards in your hand. You can draw a terrible hand and have a weak alien power and still come out on top - if you know how to play people. How to get on their good sides, and how to stay there. How to recognize when to betray them and when not to. Not being able to choose your target is actually a boon, because grudges don't tend to happen this way. "It wasn't my choice," you say, as you throw everything you have at whoever the deck dictates. Or not. Maybe it's in your best interest to build up long-term friendships at the start of a game. Or maybe you'll let other people do the heavy lifting and tag along in battles, going for a mutual victory.

In one of my early games, I drew the alien called The Mind. The Mind's power is to be able to see what another player's hand is before battles start. It's an overwhelmingly powerful thing to have, and it went straight to my head. Before I knew it, everyone was ganging up on me because I was too quick to storm into fights and win almost every time. Everyone collectively saw what a threat I was, and in the end, I lost. It both humbled me and taught a lesson not to assume I could just win because I had something so strong that it nearly broke the game. But it didn't: the other players themselves were the balance.

This game has been around since 1977(!) and it's clear why: this is an absolute masterpiece of game design that all social negotiation games should strive to achieve.

Cosmic is a strange game, I read enough about it years ago to know that it wasn't my particular kind of game, and it really isn't, yet, it's a game that I can see enjoying once in a while with the right group, provided that people play it quickly and in the correct spirit.

The game itself is obviously chaos, you don't know what your opponent's attack capability is (because it's largely dictated by random cards), you don't get to choose your opponent (because that's also just randomized at the start of your turn), and you can end up being manoeuvred into a corner by other players who decide that you need to be knocked down a peg (because the combat, though random in terms of opponents, is not at all in terms of alliances, and leaders can have the whole table gang up against them). 

This is essentially the prototype for every American style take that game that I dislike. For some reason, Cosmic does this better though. It fits into a short time frame, has basic rules that are simple enough to make the system comprehensible once the alien powers and flares are added in, and really can be approached almost as Diplomacy with some randomness, because politicking seems to be the real place where the game is won and lost, which is something that I [i]do[/i] enjoy on occasion.

Absolutely nothing that I would want to play regularly, but with the right group I do think this has some enjoyable elements. Maybe I'm getting [i]less[/i] curmudgeonly in my old age! :laugh:

It is just a party in a box. The variable player powers just really draw people in and make the game fresh each time. They create a fascinating balance of power that really helps the game shine.

One of my favorite things to do in games is to try and set up ridiculous scenarios and seeing how they pan out. (Asking my friend to pick his ten least favorite cards to play with in Dominion and then playing with all of them in one game, for example)

Cosmic Encounter pretty much guarantees ridiculous stuff happening constantly, and that's my favorite thing about it. The amount of ridiculous alien combinations are endless, and pairing that with the fact that most of the aliens have ridiculous abilities anyway is what makes me love this game so much.

I also like how impersonal of a war-game (if you can even call it that) it is. Deciding who to attack is based completely on chance which only serves to make the game more interesting than less-strategic (which is what you think might be the case)

Really just something you should give a shot, it may not be EVERYONE'S game, but you're bound to have one or two good games with it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
There are few games that can actually say that it is a completely new experience every time you play, but Cosmic Encounter delivers. Every Alien power makes each player behave differently, and the discovery of crafty powers, tricky cards, bluffs, betrayals, and overwhelming forces makes this into a game that is constantly shifting, changing, and evolving. Fantasy Flight made a version of Cosmic Encounters that brings the game back to it's roots, back to the original game before it was ruined by other developers. This new version also adds clarity to some of the rules that had long been in question.

Some games are too random to be enjoyed but that's not the case, Cosmic encounter is not "random". A coin toss is what you call "random". Playing Cosmic Encounter is like tossing the coin but catching some unexpected nasty thing: a lizzard, a wet cat, a piano... This is not "random" because the outcomes are much beyond the initial scope.

With CE I feel like the pilot of a cosmic spacecraft flying to an unexplored galaxy. It will be a great surprise but still I feel like a pilot. And is immensely fun :-)

One of the major drawbacks of this game is that not every game is "great". Sometimes the game becomes blotched for unknown reasons. This is what makes a difference between CE and other "non cosmic spacecraft" games that I rate better.

Note: Is curious to note that from a structural poin of view this game is totaly equivalent to Munchkin.

I like the gameplay. It is very high on interaction (which is a big tick in the box for me), but the length really works against the game. We played with 3 players, and it took nearly four hours (first game). The lack of a finite end point until someone gets to 5 colonies made it go for a long time.

More so than most games, Cosmic Encounter is all about the people you play with and the alliances and shenanigans that ensue. Everyone gets an overpowered alien, and the deck contains a significant number of powerful flares. You have to work together to stop the leader, and there is often more than one winner in a game. It's unique and a classic.

The game that got me into board gaming. It produces such an awesome, funny, frustrating night of theater. It creates such great memories that we remember plays from months earlier. Any game that can do that, regardless of mechanics, is an absolute winner by me.

Feb. 10, 2009 -- Not quite what I expected. While not bad, the game seems to come down to whoever is lucky enough to push to five points first. In the game I played, everyone was nearing the end, and it came down to one player being able to get his final base. I'd play this again to see if there's more to the game than my initial impressions, but it seems to me there needs to be more to it. 6/10

Fantasy Flight did a great job on their re-print. I'm hoping expansions will add a sixth player and lucre (with the accompanying aliens) cause the game just isn't the best it can be until you're playing it with six!

Update: I just purchased the expansion and am happy to say that they added the sixth player--that is awesome! I like the aliens they added, too, overall, but am not in love with some of their new rules--the extra deck is unnecessary in my opinion. I'll just add it to the regular deck and play--the only problem is, by making the backs different, FFG forces me to buy opaque card protectors so that you can't tell when someone has one of the new cards from the extra deck. I know why they did it, but I don't like it. Now they just need to add lucre! Lastly, although I rate this edition a 10, the original Eon edition is still my favorite--I'd rate it an 11 if I could!

Not what I expected... not sure what that was anymore exactly but this is a game I can't really compare to any other.

After two four-player games, initial impression is good.  Played this with my kids though, and it's a bit mean spirited for players that age.

Passionate players may want to avoid this because it's very interactive and opportunistic.  You can ally with another player on one turn, and then turn around and attack them the next.

I am looking forward to playing this with adult groups (I think).

Starting my rating out at 8 only because I'm a Cosmic Encounter newbie.  Though, I think this one could go as high as 10 for me.  Cannot think of a better multi-player game of alliances and super combo power.  Would love to play this more so that the mechanics were second nature to the power combos and alliance play.

FFG:  I'll buy any expansion you make for this.  Your version is perfect.

RATING: 7
Starting this out at a 7. There is certainly replayability built into the game, and it feels like it needs it! I think repeat play will get those who don't "get it" a little more involved. At first, without knowing how the game plays out, you see no point to inviting specific people and not others ... and the powers seem wildly unbalanced ... but the fact that the sneaky race (and not the powerful ones) won had the rest of the table flabbergasted.

Of course once people realized Peter drew a 40 and saved it for the final battle, there was grumblings about never seeing anything higher than a 12, etc.

Hopefully we can get this to the table a few times to see if it will move into the rotation.

This has to be one of the most brilliant games ever designed. Simple rules at heart, though the meat of the game is breaking the rules at every turn. If you happen to know people who need a strict rule-set in order not to get frustrated with a game, have them stay in another room while you play^^. This is a tight bundle of gloriously chaotic interstellar scheming, backstabbing fun. Play this!

Maybe negotiation games just aren't my style?  I'm not sure, but the format for this game just didn't click with me.

On the one hand I appreciate that the game isn't terribly complicated to teach (at least on the surface), and you don't directly choose who to attack (unless you draw a wild).  On the other hand it just felt like you were doing the same thing over and over.  Draw, try to recruit allies, lay down a card, resolve.  Wash, rinse, repeat.  I think it just drags too much for me.

Granted, our first play dragged on too long and most of us got frustrated.  And I did see glimmers of a good game at moments, like when you try to outsmart a player that can switch the attack cards.  But not enough I liked to make me want to slog through this again.

It is a fairly fun and wacky game, but despite the massive variety in player powers it always ends up playing out the same way for me: most players get to 4 colonies without much difficulty, then everyone exhausts their blocking cards until someone can't be stopped from taking a 5th.

A great negotiation and bluffing game, best with 4-5 people.  The FFG version only supports 5 players, but I'm hoping the next expansion will increase this to 6 or seven.  The artwork is fantastic and (more importantly) the gameplay is fast and engaging for all.  Downtime is limited.  I've played this game (different versions) with numerous new players and all have picked it up quickly and had a good time.

First time when I heard about CE I thought "these will be my perfect game, tons of interaction, a space opera humorous theme, alliances and negotiation.. nice!"
After 2 games I started to feel a little disappointed, too chaotic, negotiation comes with nothing but two aspects of the game (colonies and cards).. So I decided to give the last chance and I´m glad of because the experience has changed completely.
It depends absolutely on the group but I recommend to play with the four planets variant and tech cards, the games start to flow and you will be able to play 4 times in a row with the same folks changing the alien powers, these is the way you will see the "infinite possibilities" of the game. And forget the random selection of alien powers!

Phenomenally fun if you're willing to accept that game balance has been thrown out the window. This is not to say that the game doesn't have checks and balances against nearly any sort of overwhelming card / ability - it does - but that the luck of the draw [in both powers and cards] and table diplomacy play far more of a role in victory than skill. If anything, this game's skill is like that of [gameid=227], where knowing what's [i]possible[/i] is what's important.

Even more fun (and even less balanced) with two powers at once, particularly if you get to choose the combo from three.

This is truly a game of negotiation. If you just want to play a game about diplomacy, this is the game. Simple enough to easily teach, and gametime is quite short so you don't feel dragged. 

The elements for negotiation are a LOT of variable player powers, with the cards and some different effects, making it very high on dynamic and replayability. But it really needs correct group of player, or the game will be boring.

I recently had a disagreement with a friend about the quality of this game.  I feel it is mediocre at best and he really likes it.  I summed up my point stating that; if i was still 12, I would love this game.  He replied in turn "you know what?  The last time I played I was about 10."

If you are looking for a heavy/Euro game, or anything that requires strategy/tactics/thinking, this is not for you.  If you want a center piece to sit around while talking and joking with your friends, this can work, But do not mistake a conversation piece for a good game.  This could just as easily be replaced in function by a witty joke, interesting story from last weekend, or a Youtube video.

Initially gave this a 3, feeling I was being to harsh.  I could not help but change to a 1.  The BGG description of a 3 implied that I could be coerced into playing this thing again, which is just not true.

Played a 5 player game. This is a game where other players tend to pick on the player that is in the lead such that everybody is in the race to win by the end.  Then whoever happens to have the best cards (and it is their turn) can steal the victory. Maybe it would play better with less people.  Since it is a fairly light game it may be fun if it moved along quicker. UPDATE: tried 3 player game and did not like it any better.

[q=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1524018/cosmic-encounter-review-rocky-start-my-favorite-ga]“CE is a game of negotiations based on the prisoner’s dilemma.” I gave a short explanation of the thought experiment and how it is used when making business decisions and in real-life high stakes negotiations. “The most important part of it is that there are something at stake. Without something to lose, the whole purpose of the game falls apart. I think we’ve been thinking about the shared victories incorrectly.” 

“Imagine we needed to ante into this game and ended up with a pot of $100. The winner of the game gets to keep the whole thing. If two people share the victory, they don’t both get $100 – they split the pot. The more people you share the victory with, the easier the game will be to win, but the less of the pot you get to take home. You should only share a victory under two conditions: you couldn’t possibly win without it or someone forced it on you with their powers or a card.”[/q]

There isn't a lot I can say about this game that hasn't already been said.  Perhaps the best classic tabletop game ever created and truly a game of infinite possibilities.
   At it's core it's a sci-fi game of diplomacy with deterministic combat (no dice-rolling) based on how many ships you're attacking or defending with and what combat card you play.  The 50 different aliens that come in the box  really are what make the game so interesting compared to other diplomatic strategy games and give it an infinite value for replays.  Watching all the crazy powers interact in strange ways make the game very different each time.
  Truly a game of infinite possibility and highly recommended.

One of the best large group games - almost no downtime as all players can be involved in all other players turns/encounters.
Rules can be tricky as timing/order really matters!
That there can be multiple winners is cool - esp. if you can negotiate the win from a bad position.
SO much negotiation in this game - also so much backstabbing! :-) - great if you're into that sort of thing.
Alien abilities are all so different - having that at the top of the cards is great too.

For the kind of game this is and the kind of moments it tries to produce, the rules are pretty murky and the gameplay can get a little tedious. Even when you manage to get past those things, the moments aren't guaranteed to arrive. You might end up with a perfectly stale, uninteresting game.

BUT: When things do come together just right, when you have the right combination of alien races and the right combination of players who are competent with the rules, this game is hilarious and surprising and delightful in a way that few other games can even hope for. I just wish it didn't sometimes feel like a slog to get there.

My favorite board game by quite a bit. Every game is different and yet the basic turn is easy enough to learn even for beginners. I like that you don't always choose who you will attack, and the alien powers really make the game a new experience every single game.

RATING: 6
It was about time I played this classic, huh?

I can see how, when it was released, this game set a new standard and rediefined many aspects of the tabletop game. And it holds up very well.

A take-that game with some constraints that help make things feel too unfair (the destiny cards controlling ganging up pretty well, but also sometimes contributing to it- however, it doesn't feel too personal).

The game's theme serves as an OK framework by which you can remember the general point of tasks, but I wouldn't say the gameplay is truly affected by the theme. The underlying game and its mechanics are too streamlined and pointed for that. It's not really a space conquest game- it's a game about placing chips into other player's spaces more efficiently than other players. 

This simplicity is a good thing, as the complexity and fun come from the interpersonal play (deciding when to be an ally or not, and which person to invite as an ally), and the myriad special powers available via the alien races.

I see now, also, where many games, such as Munchkin, derived most of their DNA. This game does a better job than most of its descendents from what I can see, handling the various interesting aspects.

A game easy to explain to new players, yet with enough depth to separate good players from poor, so that it rewards choices. Somewhat light weight, so it has carved out its place well at the table.

New to our group, we played this game for six straight hours and barely scratched the surface of possible alien interactions.  For a game that features "take that" gameplay, it's hard to hold a grudge for very long and stay in the hunt for the win. Allies one encounter, opponents the next.

Easy to learn, easy to play, endless variety and insanely fun.

Cosmic Encounter is simply awesome. There are so many things that are great about it it's hard to even start listing them. To enjoy Cosmic Encounter you must be able to accept the fact that there is a lot of luck and chaos. There is so much variation in the base game alone that you'll be playing hundreds of games without seeing the same game twice. I don't ever see myself getting bored of Cosmic. Do you Cosmic? I certainly do. I recommend this game to open-minded people who want to socialise and have fun.

After one play, it was fun and I can see a lot of potential.  But there were way too many rules questions, it seems like you need 4+ players for the game to hit it's stride.  The only issue our group raised was that there seemed to be limited choices.  The cards usually dictated one move that was much better than the rest.  I would like to get a few more plays in, but finding the right people might be an issue due to the learning curve.

This game started out being hit and miss with my group.  On one hand it was great having different powers that break the game, but on the other hand, some of the powers were significantly better than others.  If the players noticed the lopsidedness, then it could be managed through the metagame.  But if it was ignored, then some people had a decided advantage in the game.

I did not feel like I was playing a game really. Certainly was not having fun. Randomness everywhere. Brokenness everywhere, but not even in a balanced or fair manner. The game supposedly is built on negotiation but it constantly seemed to prevent that from really working. Fiddly. More broken randomness. Boring. Sit around and wait forever for your next turn or first turn which may never come. If you have no cards and no way of getting new cards and have already been pummeled and lost most your ships, then it's really fun downtime. The players need to balance the brokenness? Really? WTF is that? So much fiddly random broken mysterious shit that people can have while other people have literally nothing useful, how can they hope to figure out how to balance it, or have fun even if they do.

I've been playing this since it first came out in the 70s and can remember trips to Brookhurst Hobbies in California to buy expansion sets. No two games are the same, but the chaos that results can fall flat on occasion as well. Finally got an insert to keep track of everything. The FFG version is the best of all of them

This was a fun game. It had a Munchkin feel to it - on any players turn other players have a chance to either help the attacker or defender and throw down cards to affect the outcome. The learning curve is a little on the steep side, but once we figured out what we were doing it was actually pretty simple. Not a great bridge game, but a lot of fun for more advanced players.

Not as bad as I thought it would be in terms of negotiation. Warrants more plays. Can get screwed by card draw more than the alliances as long as you aren't being ganged up on. The best part about the game is the simultaneous hidden combat card play but there's no way to predict what other bonus artifact cards people play so it is a lot of chance unless you have a special ability that gives you the upper hand in fights.

Card combat is mildly interesting.

The random opponent draw on the destiny deck helps prevent people from targeting the weakest player.

Similar mechanisms to the hated Munchkin game as well but what separates it is the unique player powers and being able to win are a bit different.

RATING: 3
Between the astronomic amount of randomness (your race, your cards, who you attack etc), the total lack of information on anything, the lack of clarity on the rules, the slapped-on theme (how is this a thematic game?) and the long playtime, I do not think of Cosmic Encounter as a good game.

The total lack of information doesn't make for a good bluffing game, the lack of options makes for a lousy strategy game and the often unclear rules, relatively long playtime and unnecessarily long and badly worded alien powers make for a mediocre casual game.

I am probably judging this harsher than I should, but I can't understand the popularity and praise this game gets. Obviously, the myriad of different alien races is it's main selling factor - but I for one think that the game doesn't really 'balance itself' (see: total randomness, the only thing you can really do is not 'invite' a player in the lead) whilst the race powers range from absurdly powerful to laughably irrelevant.

Rated 3 because I will never get this game out if there aren't a bunch of people asking to play it - and there never are.

This game has been around a long while, and I had heard many good things about it, which is why I finally decided to jump in and give it a try.  This is such a unique board game experience, very different than most other games in my collection.  The game creates so much player interaction that it keeps everyone more engaged than most other games where you each take a "turn" and until your turn comes back, it's just downtime.  The constant shifting of alliances really helps keep "grudges" from forming, since most conflict is forced from the destiny deck.  The variety of alien powers is what most excites me about the game, because I love games that feel like a new experience each time, and with the large amount of alien races available to choose from (100 in my collection at this point) makes me confident that we will have a fresh gaming experience each time we play.  Love this game, instant favorite for me, and everyone I have played it with so far has ended the game saying they had a good time. . . and that's what board gaming is all about.

Easily the best boardgame I've played.

Unlike so many other games, Cosmic never feels "samey", it never gets predictable, and it never grows old. I will be playing this game for years and years to come with absolutely zero chance of burning out and growing tired of it. The variety and the replay value are simply overwhelming.

Most importantly, Cosmic can never be solved. It can't be played on auto-pilot, and there are no "optimal plays". The only "correct opening move" in Cosmic is the one that your opponent failed to anticipate. Everything can be beaten, everything can be undermined, and everything can be predicted and punished.

The game system inherently defeats (almost) all attempts to break it, and all attempts to solve it. You can't win Cosmic Encounter by beating the game itself; you can only win by beating your opponents.

(There are a few combos of Alien Powers that can break the game when you start playing the unofficial Double or Triple Alien Power variants, but with the absurd variety of over-the-top powers in this game, it is impressive how truly few game-smashers there are given the ridiculous number of combinations that are possible.)

All of that, and I haven't even mentioned the social aspect yet. I could gush a bit more here, but I'll be brief: This game is all about the other players --the human beings, your friends and family, that have sat down to play with you. This game isn't about strategy guides, optimizing efficiency formulas, or referencing spreadsheets; it's about people.

Cosmic Encounter is, quite simply, endlessly replayable and endlessly fun. What more could you want?

3-5

Doel: als eerste aanwezig zijn op 5 vreemde planeten.

Set up:

Het zwarte gat komt in het midden van de tafel. Elke speler plaatst zijn 4 ruimteschepen op elk van zijn 5 planeten. Elke speler trekt 1 identiteitskaart. Elke speler krijgt 7 kaarten uit het kaartendeck (met attack-, negotiate- en artefact-kaarten).

Speelbeurt:

1/ Je neemt 1 ruimteschip uit het zwarte gat en plaatst dit op een eigen kolonie (in een eigen planeet of vreemde planeet). 
2/ Je draait een kaart om. De kleur bepaalt de speler die je aanvalt. Wanneer je je eigen kleur trekt, trek je een nieuwe kaart.
3/ Je kiest 1 tot 4 eigen ruimteschepen en plaatst deze op de pijl. Je kiest zelf van welke planeten je je eigen schepen wegneemt. Wanneer je het laatste schip van een planeet wegneemt, is de planeet niet meer in jouw bezit.
4/ De pijl wijst een planeet aan in de juiste kleur.
5/ De offensieve speler mag bondgenoten zoeken. Hij noemt de kleuren van de spelers die hem mogen helpen. De andere spelers zeggen nog niets.
6/ De defensieve speler mag nu bondgenoten zoeken op dezelfde manier als de offensieve speler.
7/ In wijzerzin beslissen alle aangeduide spelers nu of ze de aanvaller/verdediger willen helpen. Als een speler alliantie biedt, neemt hij 1 tot 4 ruimteschepen en plaatst deze schepen bij de aanvaller/verdediger. 
8/ De aanvaller en verdediger spelen gedekt een strijdkaart. 
9/ De strijdkaarten worden tegelijkertijd opengedraaid. 
10/ Het strijdresultaat wordt bepaald:

A Beide spelers spelen een aanvalskaart: hoogste totaal wint (waarde op kaart + aantal eigen en geallieerde schepen).

A1 De aanvaller wint: 
+ schepen aanvaller + geallieerden gaan naar veroverde planeet.
+ schepen van verdediger en geallieerde schepen gaan naar het zwarte gat.

A2 De verdediger wint: 
+ schepen van verdediger blijven staan. 
+ schepen van de aanvaller en de geallieerde schepen gaan naar het zwarte gat.
+ geallieerde schepen van verdediger gaan terug naar eigen kolonies. Zij krijgen defensieve bonus: voor elk schip dat deelnam mag de speler 1 strijdkaart van de stapel of 1 jager recupereren uit het zwarte gat. Dit mag gecombineerd worden. 

B  Beide spelers spelen een onderhandelingskaart.
+ Alle geallieerden van beide kampen trekken terug naar hun eigen kolonies (zonder voordeel). 
+ De aanvaller en verdediger krijgen 1 minuut om een akkoord te bereiken (bijv. ruilen/geven van handkaarten en/of koloniseren van planeet). Geen akkoord binnen de minuut: zowel de aanvaller als verdediger verliezen 3 schepen die in het zwarte gat worden geplaatst.

C De spelers spelen een onderhandelings- en een aanvalskaart.
+ De aanvaller wint altijd. 
+ De schepen van de verliezer en de geallieerden gaan naar het zwarte gat. De verliezende speler trekt als compensatie evenveel kaarten uit de handkaarten van de winnende speler als hij eigen schepen (geen geallieerden) heeft. De geallieerden van de verliezer krijgen geen compensatie.

Als de eerste strijd wordt verloren, dan is de volgende speler aan de beurt. Als de strijd wordt gewonnen, dan mag de aanvaller beslissen om nog een tweede keer aan te vallen. Na deze tweede strijd eindigt zijn beurt sowieso.

Spelers trekken enkel 7 nieuwe kaarten wanneer men bij een strijd een kaart moet spelen en de speler op dat moment geen enkele kaart meer op handen heeft.
Wanneer een speler 3 (of meer) kolonies van een eigen planeet verspeelt, dan mag je de speciale gaven van je karakter niet meer gebruiken.

Op artefactkaarten staat aangeduid in welke fase je de kaarten mag spelen. Volgorde bij het spelen van artefacten en speciale effecten: eerst de speler links van de aanvaller, daarna de aanvaller zelf en vervolgens de verdediger.

Played a few times now. Good theme, intentionally chaotic game play, and relatively quick. Probably best with 4 or 5 players.

Note to self: Keep the alien colors the same among all players for best results, i.e. everyone should be green, or yellow, or red. Mixing and matching tends to result in unfair matchups.

Edit: After some more plays, just wasn't enjoying it as much. With 5 or 6 you're lucky if you get two turns in before the game is over which isn't very fun. Sold.

The FFG edition is the only way to go.  I previously owned the AH version, and it was terrible.  FFG has better components, more aliens, flare cards, technology cards, special destiny cards, and wonderful artifact cards.

This game is just simply fun.  You do have to play with the right crowd.  You can not take things personally in this game because it is best played completely cutthroat.  You have to be prepared for swings and people ganging up on you.  If you can not handle this, I suggest passing on this game.

The basic rules are really simple, and anyone could play it (though I understand why some people don't want to play  a game where the skill is sooo mitigated by how political it is).
Then you get the alien races, and flares, and all this other stuff and makes it so each game is completely different. Everyone gets their own unique power that changes how the game plays, and all the politics that helped so much before, while still there, can't guarantee you anything now.

It says half an hour (I think?), but who knows. We've had games take 10 minutes and be over before someone got a turn, and have had games take 3 hours because of certain combinations of races and powers, all stopping the current player who's about to win from actually winning. It can get a little Munchkin-y in that regard, and isn't very engaging with expanded players counts from the expansions.

I had forgotten how great Cosmic is but you MUST MUST MUST play with more than one power.

December 2017 - 8.8
My last few games of Cosmic have been hampered by the game dragging a little, mostly due to confusion/debates over what cards and alien powers exactly do an how they interact. And despite being lengthy games, I've found myself only having a single turn on offense before the game ends. And when your alien power only works on offense, it's not as fun.

[April 2015 - 9.0]
Boom! In a month Cosmic moves up the charts on the basis of playing with the right people. If everyone is into it, it becomes a rowdy good time, especially toward the end where everyone is trying to keep the leaders in check and play catch up. I really love the unique aspect of several players winning at the same time. That adds to the wonderful team play this game fosters. It's a mix of King of Tokyo and Lifeboats, with the alien powers adding great replayability. Still some alien powers seem a little weak, but mostly it depends on what other powers are out. Excited to see what the expansions have in store for the game.

[March 2015 - 8.6]
Biggest thing about this game is that you have to play with the right people who are willing to have fun with the dynamics. I've played with some people who seem to try and go through the motions with this game, but it's more about the emotions, alliances and keeping leaders in check to extend the game. Definitely there are some alien power combinations that are more fun than others in a game. Four- and five-player games are where this game begins to get fun.

This was fun.  I think my rating will creep up as we get more plays under our belts, but we were quite hindered by constant questioning of rules and timing of effects etc...

I must say however, that this is one of the few games where we were actually cheering and giving each other high fives as encounters unfolded...

We are still limited to "green" aliens, and haven't explored technology yet.

Ambiguity about rules and constant partnering and backstabbing means that the table will just argue the whole time, and in the end, you'll likely get a meaningless 3 or 4 way tie for the win.   Why bother?

Probably the best job at remaking the original.  Actually, I think it's better than the original.  Better components, better rules, better play all around. Unfortunately, it just didn't see enough play time.  It absolutely does not work as a 2-player, and 3-player is almost as bad.  In fact, IMO this game should never be played with less than 5 players.  Period.

Cosmic is quite possibly my favourite board game. It's an exercise in controlled chaos, with fascinating relationships between the alien powers - which will change as the game progresses, and dependant on the board position.

Cosmic tends to be well within playable time scales, and easily graspable by non-gamers. It's accessible fun and wonderful, and doesn't take itself too seriously.

If I'm in the mood for a deep involving game then I'll play a wargame or an abstract, for everything else there's Cosmic.

Could be fun, but I suspect it needs the right crowd. Haven't found it yet...And I also need to get over the randomness. Maybe it wouldn't bother me in a shorter game, but it seems a bit excessive in a game of this length.

This is my personal #1.  This is truly an infinite game.  I hesitated to purchase this ultimately because the components looked so simple that the game couldn't be that fun.  I wanted it even still and broke down and picked it up on a whim.  This game is amazing.  Play it often.  It is very intense, lots of strategy, easy to learn, and difficult to master.  I love the variety employed by the alien races and only hope that Fantasy Flight release more expansions.  The first one is on the way for me.

RATING: 8
I love it.  It plays quickly, has enough randomness to prevent ultra competitive people from getting upset, and the alien powers are so much fun.  It also has a surprising amount of strategy for a game that seems really random at first glance.  Its a really fun game and I can't recommend it enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Approached my first game of this expecting some form of in depth 4x strategy game (so successfully now realised by Eclipse) but it's not that type of game at all.

This is really 'Bang' in space - and played in this spirit is a fun blast. The new (2011) fanstay flight production is excellent quality (cards, bits, planets) with the exception of the box, which has great art but is slightly flimsy and difficult to open.

Update (Sept 2013): A second play of this and this play didn't quite live up to what I was expecting. The various alien powers produced a bit of a log-jam game and one in which I was almost completely stymied by my card draws. I also had a couple of false plays due to not fully grasping the timing/ability of some card plays. Also, despite the fact that the other players had played the game quite a bit, such is the variety and number of differing special effects, there was still a lot of 'what does that do?', 'when does it do it?' type queries. The game would therefore appear to be fiddly and remain fiddly despite repeated plays. 

So the jury is still out for me on this. Fiddly and can play quite long for what it is, given that the cards can screw you - where the latter is the case the game really needs to come in just over the hour mark.

UPDATE - another try of this, making sure that we played only with some simple (green) aliens created a much better game experience. I'm sure some of the more complex, game bending aliens are fun, once you have the games 'normal' rhythm fully understood, but when you don't they just bewilder and frustrate - definitely learn to walk before you run with this one. Will likely keep.

RATING: 8
Crazy, chaotic Cosmic Encounter: probably the best concise description I can come up with for a game which defined the very idea of simple rules that are constantly broken by the player's powers and cards that they play. The goal of the game is simple: establish colonies on 5 of your opponent's planets using your 20 ships. Thing is, you don't get to pick (well, most of the time) who you target so you need to make the most out of your attacks. And also, you don't get to draw cards at the start/end of your turn, but only when you need them. And then there's the special powers of your alien race. I did mention that *all* of the different powers break the rules in different ways, right? And that the basic game comes with something like 40 or 50 of them? And that ultimately, they are not balanced? None of this matters as the game is incredibly fun and funny to play as long as you don't take it very seriously. While it may look like someone is running away with the win, the game actually has a habit of having wild swings, which usually means that it ends up much closer than it has any rights to be. Lots of fun and recommended.

This is THE game. If I went to a desert island and could only take one game it would be this. Simple in design, yet infinitely replayable and easily expandable. I have yet to finish a game of this without thinking I want to play again either with the same aliens or with new ones. A game that has lasted for over 35 years has to be doing something right.

This seemed okay however it wasn't exactly fun for me.  I was screwed royally by the end of the first couple of turns in games one with no real hope of coming back into it and in game two I didn't see an attack card above 08 until the very end of the game (where I got a 13, woo hoo).  Unsurprisingly I wasn't able to actually win any battles myself all game.  Very, very frustrating.

I'm still (currently) willing to give it another shot though.

I really enjoy the diplomacy aspect as well.  If one takes the lead they need to prepare for a "bring down the leader" attitude from the other players.  Most of the time you want to bide your time and just make sure you're keeping up with everyone, and then strike at the end when no one is suspecting your imminent victory!

Okay so the basic mechanics are great, going to other people's planets, fighting them, forming alliances and using special cards on it's own would be crazy fun and well worth the price tag. But where this game goes the real extra mile is with it's alien races. The special powers and huge number of them make the game almost endlessly replayable even without any expansions. Definitely a must-have.

RATING: 10
This is *the* definitive edition for the modern era.  One of the seminal games in the hobby.  With re-usable flares, 50 aliens with awesome artwork, cool plastic UFOs, technology cards, this game feels like the older editions with a few new expansions already built in.  The variability of the alien powers in this game continues to astound me. Every game is completely different, completely unique. It can be wildly unbalanced at times, but the ever-shifting alliances compensate. There are no shortage of surprises and dynamic interactions.  The game is more interactive than just about anything else.  At it's heart, it is a hand management game, where the key is to get the maximum utility out of your worst cards, usually accomplished in some devious fashion by leveraging the alien powers in play.  A supreme classic, so far ahead of its time.   I would give it 11 if I could.

Random, back-stabbing, lying, deceit, trickery... That's what you'll get when you pick up this classic game. Be the first to colonize 5 planets and you win, BUT...

Pinnacle of negotiation games. Gotta love the imbalance between the different species' powers - sure, your species may be weaker than your opponents, but this means they'll be more likely to make deals with you and will make your victory so much sweeter.

As always, toxic personalities can poison the rest of the game - if you've got a good crew for these sort of games, you should absolutely own a copy.

Chaotic nonsense.  Essentially its just a party game about playing diplomacy on others but with a slew of non-streamlined muddled rules thrown.  Some games last only 30 minutes, some 3+ hours.  Totally unpredictable since the game is a perpetual gang-up-on-the-leader that just prolongs the game more.  The ‘fun’ is supposed to come from the diplomacy, interaction and backstabbing that occurs, but for that, I would rather play Diplomacy (which has more streamlined rules/mechanics) or Game of Thrones (which at least feels like there is some sustainable strategy involved and overall just feels more like ‘a game’).  I keep calling this thing “Chaotic Encounter.”

Almost the perfect game.  Does require that you play with the right sort of people (people who don't mind being ganged up on now and then).

Cosmic is a classic design that I really enjoy.  There are some things people don't like about this game.

The race powers are completely unbalanced, of course.  There are some that do nothing at all unless it's your encounter and you win, in which case you get a pretty marginal win-more bonus.  There are others that are always-on passive, useful things.  Some are very easy to understand, others highly technical.   But this variety is the game's strength.  It's up to the players to find the balance in their games, to prevent someone from running away with it.

Turn order, sadly, is the biggest real strike against it.  The game won't last usually more than a couple rounds through the table, so if you're to the right of the start player, you might only get a single turn before it's over.  This doubly sucks if you've got a power like the one above, which only works on offense, and triply if you lose your first encounter and never get to do anything positive at all.

With some groups, this just falls completely flat.  If you don't care enough to get into it, to wheel and deal at least a minimal amount, to care about who allies with who, and who ultimately wins, this will be awful.  Some are put off by the lack of control in the destiny deck, others by the simple highest-total-wins combat.  The bare-bones design is pretty random, and can be skewed into one-sided games.  There can also be rules interpretation questions, even with the new edition, and that's before you get into the complexities of the variants like technology.  But, if you can get a group interested, this game can be a  real winner.
Personally, I feel like Cosmic is a great game.  It's a game that transcends its simplicity and engages the player with simple, yet meaningful choices.  Who to ally with, and how much to commit?  Use a high card now, or save it for later on?  Is it worth burning that all-important cosmic/card zap for this situation?   It can overstay its welcome a little, if the play is slow, and (much as I love expansions) tossing in too many variants can slow that down even more.  But I'd still play this almost anytime.

Edition note: This new FFG release is quite slick, and has the phases printed out on the sheets and cards, telling you graphically exactly when the card/power can be used.  This, as well as precise wording and so on, heads off a lot of rules arguments.

If they expand this with a few more powers, add Kickers and add Negative Attack cards this will be the best version of CE made. The art is fantastic, the timing system is dead on and the power complexity rating is a great idea. I really like the new and old powers in this base set. Also, not having a board but separate planet tiles works well.

I have one complaint, I don't like that the plague card has changed. But then I am not one to shy away from a house rule in CE.


I have not played with the technology cards (yet).

My favourite game. The sheer variety of aliens, no two games are the same. There are some complaints that the game isn't balanced, but the other players in the game gang up on on the more powerful aliens, so it's self-balancing. 

Crazy and chaotic, the game is almost a 10. I would make it a 10 if a 6-7 player game didn't take so long. 

I have all of the currently available expansions. Each adds something different to the game, even if it's just more aliens, and all are worth getting. However, I have gone through and removed all of the aliens that I've found to be boring, or not fun, or just stupid. I think that accounted for around 25 aliens. Also the Entropy Beast Hazard card. That thing is just stupid.

The best part about this game that I don't see too many people talking about is just figuring out how to win when dealt a terrible hand. For those who say there's not enough strategy or its just a negotiating game, being dealt a terrible hand and turning that hand into a winning game is the best feeling...yes, you're at the mercy of the deck, but you can still maneuver your way into a win with good timing. Love the game! Fun game to have some beers and play a fairly involved "party game."

Edit: To add some clarification to my rating, this 9 and the expansion "Cosmic Incursion" (10/10) are primarily due to the fact that this light hearted game provides a medium for good friends to have an entertaining time. If you're looking for a game with clever card play, or highly strategic game, this isn't it. But if you have a group of people that like to role play a bit, act out, but prefer a bit more challenging game...this may be right up your alley.

I got this game because of Tom Vasel, and a recommendation from important member of my gaming group. Not tailored to my taste but this game brought so much fun every time we played it. It's a game of space area control, diplomacy, randomness, war and a lot of backstabbing. The beauty of this game is huuuge variety of wicked (sometimes hilarious) alien races and a game mechanic by which your opponent is decided by destiny rather than pure choice.
One of the oldest modern board games of 20th century which are going to be fun for many years to come.

ulitmate replayability, high tension, high player interaction. Close to the perfect game, but probably not my favourite game.

You have to accept its random nature. There is plenty of strategy in this game, plenty of room for manipulation. Having the best alien power isn't necessarily that important. Having a hand with several decent alien power cards is more useful. This is a game where someone can pull a card out and destroy you in one move. But if your cool with this, its is awesome fun.

Negotiation Game w/ variable powers. Permanent member.
I love negotiation games, and this one is one of the best. Its strength may lie in the fact that your skill in diplomacy, once discovered, will not cause a gang-up in the next game; the perceived strength of the randomly distributed powers will.

I read somewhere in bgg that "you win at Cosmic Encounter because other people let you." Social interaction will                determine the outcome of this game, rather than tactics.

One word you're going to love if you play Cosmic Encounter is the word "except." 

You're given a series of rigidly defined rules. Then every player breaks the shit out of them. Turns the game upside down. 

Every player gets an alien power that allows them to break the rules in some way. And by "break" I mean smash, disregard and turn the rules upside down. One alien wins by losing. Another can't die. Yet another uses entire planets as weapons. In the base box, there are 50 unique aliens, and each of them is about as bullshit overpowered as the other.

And yet balance doesn't ever seem to be an issue, because of the fluidly defined alliances. 

Edit 16/12/2015
Downrated to 8.0
Game is highly group dependent. A couple of members of my regular gaming group refuses to play this because they dislike 1.) randomly selecting who to attack and 2.) the kingmaking element. Last time I played this the game stalled out at the 4 point mark, and it became a game of "counter each player in turn or lose the game." i.e. like Munchkin, which I despise.

I think my biggest complaint with this game is I did not do enough research prior to playing it.  It was not explained to me that this was for the most part a game of bluffing and negotiation.  I am absolute crap at that and had the misfortune of going first. Got to watch my fellow gamers learn what not to do after taking my turn which just left a sour taste in my mouth.

After a few more plays of this it's clearly one of my favorite games. I love how it's unpredictable every time, and how it never fails to make me laugh to tears. Not a game for everybody, and even people who end up liking it might need two or three plays to really get it and appreciate it. My favorite game that I almost never play. I wish I knew more people into this.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My impression of this game is a light chaotic game with combat and negotiation.  The best part of this game is the near infinite differing interactions of the players through the various Alien races, combined with flare cards and the many variants that can be added seamlessly.  I feel it was somewhat expensive for a light game such as this and if you're looking for an alternative due to the price, Shadow Hunters is a good choice but with less variety that replaces the negotiation with deduction. My only main issue with the game is that with so many powers and abilities that there are going to be many rules issues that will have to be house-ruled/voted on when encountered as well as the fact that you can have a situation where everyone but one person wins... even when that doesn't happen (which isn't often), there can be many joint victory situations. Pretty good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Amazing fun for the simplistic mechanics. Though initially it feels like a random luck draw, the amount of choice at the player's disposal nearly removes this entirely. Bluffing your cards, knowing when to strike hard, or gather allies and defend - it's an amazing game. And infinite replayability!

This game embraces chaos, and is best when you accept that you won't know what's going on. I love games that encourage tentative and temporary allying, and this is the essence of Cosmic Encounter. But, unlike other games with political elements, it's hard to hold a grudge when you're done. Have played maybe 15-20 games, this is definitely on my 'need to play more' list.

This game gets so much positive feedback, I felt I should try it.

It wasn't for me. In theory I like the idea of the game, but did not care for the execution. Most of the time I felt like I had few decisions to make (not being able to choose who one attacks or the fact that I was dealt a hand of 'number' encounter cards that I could only use on my turn), and kind of just waited for the game to end. Afterward, people explained that can happen in the game if you are dealt a bad hand or starting race.

Well call me crazy, but I enjoy a game were I succeed or fail based upon my gameplay and not the luck of the draw. Also the the small spread in score (you are at 0-4 or 5 which is win) felt pointless, "Ok blah blah person X is at 4 points, lets make sure he can't win.... a few turns later player Y is at 4 points, same thing.... fast forward till most of the players are about to win, and then finally one gets to 5." Well why not just start everyone at 4 points?

I dunno, it just rubbed me wrong.

Just got this last year for my birthday. Neither the buddy who bought it for me or I had ever played but we had heard great things about it.  This is a goofy game and a lot of fun.  It wasn't quite what my friend and I thought it would be but it works really well.  We've only had the opportunity to play it with three players but I can imagine a game with 4 or five would be a blast.  The combination of racial abilities and the special abilities makes this game crazy unique.  I really want to play this game with more players.

[1 play] My disappointment with this game wes largely a function of my expectations.  Having always heard it compared to Dune, I expected something equally rich and epic.  What I got was a relatively short, slight game with the annoying, Munchkin-like quality of everyone continually ganging up on the leader to keep the game from ending.  Perhaps the original edition was substantially different, or perhaps subsequent plays would reveal more to this.  But at first impression, I'm underwhelmed.

Played a couple of 4 player games, looking forward to more plays when I understand the rules better. I think this one will be a winner. *Update: two plays later and I'm not sure about this one. The alien powers completely influence how the players negotiate, and the card play may be too random and too "take that!" When one player was close to winning and everyone else was playing any card they could against him someone said, "This is just like Munchkin." In that moment he was right and that's not a good thing.

Cosmic Incursion included.

Takes a while to figure it out and play for what it is which is a chaotic "screw you" battle/negotiation and deception game.  IMO it could lose its appeal to the crowd its probably meant for due to the steep learning curve.  However with the right group of people who know how to play it can really shine. The artwork and pieces are very nice so the price makes some sense.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) A negotiation/conquest game whose main virtue is that it plays significantly faster than [GAMEID=121], which is otherwise superior in every regard. Oh, well, except for bits. The bits for Cosmic Encounter are great. Not really my thing, though.

I really enjoy social games and this game can be so much fun with the right group.  Sometimes things can get confusing trying to figure out how things resolve with different alien race interactions, but that is because there are just so many aliens now with all of the expansions, which I think is great.  My biggest complaint is that I don't get to play this as much as I would like because some people just really dislike it.

I honestly don't have anything good to say about this game.  It seems like it wants to have strategy, but has huge imbalances in the way attacks are chosen and hands are dealt.  Its not terribly fast, and despite there being 50+ different races, each player only gets 1 of them.  Having access to more than 1 race would give you some additional choices.

While I can see the allure of the powers and alliances, it doesn't attract me. The game can drag as people keep pulling the leader back and alliances are realigned. I don't like negotiation games especially when they're married to a "He's winning! GET HIM!" element.  

I played this many years ago and could be convinced to revisit.

Strangely, one of our favorite family games, and I have pretty young children (a ten year old and soon to be seven year old twins).  The zaniness and wackiness of this game is the stuff of the legend, and you can get some hilarious action and card sequences with the different alien powers.  A classic and brilliant design; you are almost always involved in everyone's turn, and the game has infinite replayability.  Fantasy Flight has done a great job of reprinting this game, and quality expansions keep coming out.

Its soooo simple and yet th depth and potential reaches olympian hights in strategy. Its like poker you have a hand and you hav to make the best of it based on your power and your opponents The deck has specific cards try to remember them. Look your hand and blff, gamble,risk, force. I am telling you its like a colourful sci fi poker in spirit not eve close in fun. Amazing huh?

Cards with extensive text slow down the game for me.  I prefer cards where at a glance, the play & the options are obvious. 

I bought this game because so many of my fellow gamers REALLY like it, so wanted it on hand.  However, I don't feel the same way and repeated plays have not increased my appreciation.

The best part of the game is its attractiveness.

Played the Avalon Hill version once, and liked it well enough that I'm wanting to buy a copy of the FFG version, along with Cosmic Incursion. It's amazing how many of my favorite games were directly or indirectly influenced by this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Pros
-Relatively simple game kept extremely varied by the huge array of unique races players must choose (over 200 with expansions)
-The combination and interaction of alien powers is different every game and refreshing
-The use of numbered cards in combat keeps players guessing and keeps it interesting
-Possibility for joint victories
-Chance to lose your power in game and the players working together are a key game balancing factor

Con
-Weak negotiation aspect of the game. It may vary on the gaming group but I found negotiation to be very weak as players often opted to just attack rather than help another player get closer to victory (there is very little things you can negotiate on, only two to three things, one of which helps someone you and your opponent closer to victory)
-Somewhat random way of deciding who you have to attack
-Depending on group, can get very competitive. In some cases, everyone except one person will win

What is there to say?  There's a reason this game has been in print more or less continuously for just shy of 40 years.  A true classic.  It feels like an interesting mix of euro and ameritrash, and I love it (even though I am clearly a die hard ameritrash gamer).  Very few games have this level of simplicity on the surface hiding infinite depths of strategy.  It's everything from a (very) light TI3 to Diplomacy, without the endless references to the rules.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
A chaotic game, with lots of random elements and pretty much everything that SHOULDN'T be done in a game, but yet it works very well and is lots of fun! Possibly the best example of Ameritrash I own. 

PROS:

*Lots of action! No building up and bunkering, no tech tree or special fluff. Just all out action. 
*Great components! FFG did a great job with the art and quality of everything in the box. 
*Randomness seems to kind of balance it's self out in most cases. Because of the destiny cards, you only can get attacked 4 times per re-shuffle. Which means that if you get attacked 3 or 4 turns in a row somehow, you'll have a break for a while to rebuild and attack other players. 
*Lots of back stabbing and table politics, and I mean LOTS.
*Easily modded for inexperienced players.

CONS:
*Needs 5 players to really get the full experience. I won't play with 3 players, and 4 is kinda meh. 
*Game can SOMETIMES take a long time, which makes it drags for what it is.

Until recently, I've only played an older edition of Cosmic Encounter, but I have to say that this new version really impressed me.  The sheer number of races available is stunning, even without adding to the number with the expansions. I like the simplicity of the basic rules of this game, mixed with all the special powers of the races along with ample opportunity for negotiation, alliances, and back-stabbing.  Having said all that, I feel like it's a bit long for what it is, and it's missing something that my favorite games have.  I have to be in the mood to want to bring this one out.

Cosmic turns everyone playing it into a uniquely repulsive alien from the far reaches of the universe. And it gives them special powers. And it makes them hate each other.

The way we played I have to rate this a 4. It barely made it once around the table, powers seemed hard to use intelligently, and the game was basically decided on card draw... With two players winning (including me). Maybe we got some rules wrong? Otherwise I can't see why this game is enjoying such a cult following...

I would have to play this again to give it a fair rating- so I left it N/A. My first experience of this game was fairly fun because I was allowed to abuse Filch's OP mechanic since everyone was generally inexperienced including myself. This also lead to a card-stalemate since nobody wanted to play cards. 

I can see how getting ganged up on in this game can be frustrating. Not a fan of semi-free-for-alls.

This game is wonderful.  A fantastic foundational structure wrapped up in absolutely endless variability and replayability. You can play this game over and over and each game will present a different story and challenges to overcome, all of it hilarious and devious. 

I will say, though, that with so many variables running around that it is possible to have a bad experience.  Whether through a lopsided distribution of good cards or bad/boring aliens.  I've experienced games where some of the alien powers were never used because they weren't helpful at all in the given circumstances.  That shouldn't stop you from playing this game at all, but maybe recognize a bad game when they happen and scrap them.  No point in finishing a game if no one's having fun.

Nem mondom, hogy két party után összeállt teljesen a játék. Az biztos, hogy egy nagyon különleges darabról van szó, ami nagyon egyedi. Gyors, már-mér partyjáték szinten szórakoztató, de azért vannak benne döntési helyzetek és el lehet agyalni azon, hogy hogyan fékezhető meg egy-egy faj az adott partyban. Mindenképp kell még vele játszani, már csak azért is mert elsőre nem minden játszottunk jól. :)

Cosmic Encounter occupies a spot that is normally taken by small filler card games: a short and heavy luckfest, starting with the alien powers that are all over the place, continuing with the combat cards going from the single digits up to 40, and not stopping at additional techs or special events.

Basically, the leader is constantly reigned back in by pooled forces until everybody meets again one step from the winning position. Then, somebody gets to decide who should win. Hurray!

Fight to get it to the table after some players inevitably hate it after their first play. The social game that evolves is worth exploring.

Fun and highly interactive game with little downtime. The main drawback is that it requires a good amount of reading and resolving the interactions between different effects is not always straightforward (e.g. Mirror vs. Chosen).

I play with flares with one group and while we enjoy them now, there was a period of lots of whining with some of the complicated flares. The same applies to some aliens and I have since culled my flares and aliens.

I also introduced the game to other beginners, but this time without flares. Made the game easier to learn and still remained very fun.

Cosmic Encounter has fun but relatively basic gameplay including negotiation and simultaneous facedown attack cards, both of which I like. However the player powers change it up so much every time that you have to figure out the balance and strategies again each time you play.

Diplomatic intergalactic conquest. Sounds really intense, but actually a pretty simple system. Draw a card to figure out who you attack, ask for help, play a numbered card, then add up ships and your number to figure out who wins. Easy. This game goes from neat diplomacy game to awesome space conquest game when you add in the unique alien powers. It makes every single game different as each combination interacts differently.

Cosmic Encounter is a game that stands out from the others.  Being deceptively simple, it is endlessly playable due to the mix of variable player powers and their different interactions throughout the game.  Even though each player can "bend" a rule, the game seems amazingly balanced. Apart from the great sci-fi theme, the mechanics feel super fresh yet this game is over 30 years old!  It has a sort of Dune feel to it (with variable player powers), and it would, seeing they're made by the same team. I could see some players getting screwed, as the know-how when using particular races can be easy to grasp or take a bit longer to get. Anyway, it's real goody, and one that brings variety to anybody's game collection. A great one for sci-fi fans and games of intense player interaction.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I don't get to play Cosmic Encounter nearly as often as I'd like.  The rules aren't exactly straightforward, the play isn't exactly balanced, the theme isn't exactly everyone's cup of tea, which makes getting it to the table difficult.  This is basically the definition of Ameritrash, and Euro-centric players aren't going to appreciate the gameplay.

I basically find this game to be as good as the people playing it want it to be.  The win condition is almost tertiary to the often-times wild takeover attempts, and sub-optimal play can yield the best experiences.

My only complaint of the game is the distribution of the attack/defense cards' values.  Either they should have had a smaller range of values or provided a sheet showing the distribution.  Too often new players won't realize that attacks in the 40s even exist.

I appropriate some of the insane powers in this game and I like that. Also the games tend to be close because everyone allies against the winner until the end so multiple people tend to have a shot at winning

In the end, negotiation focused games aren't my thing and are really affected by the group you play with. I'd rather play GoT because you have more control over some of the mechanics in that game and I wouldn't even play that game often

[b][i]Cosmic Encounter[/i][/b] is a thematic game with enough luck, strategy, and negotiation to keep it interesting for everyone. This game has been a hit for a wide range of age groups and game aptitude levels because the core of Cosmic is simple and non-confrontational: just draw a card and attack the listed player. Being forced to encounter a player makes combat relaxed and light-hearted. In fact between combat, player cards, and alien powers, there's so much randomness in Cosmic that it might seem to be completely devoid of strategy at first blush. However, although strategy is on the lighter side, the randomness is balanced by hand management and negotiation so that the game is as involved as you want it to be--there's definitely enough to keep serious gamers entertained. Negotiations are required for the game to be at its best.

Replay-ability is guaranteed through a wide range of alien races. The drastically different aliens are fun and have color coded difficulty levels to easily scale the game's complexity.

My all time favourite game. Could play this all day everyday and never play the same game twice with all the expansions. Every time we play it we all have a great time, a laugh and there is always a story. Great interaction. Nice balance of strategy and luck, but very dependant on who you play with and how many times you've played the game. It gets better and deeper with every play

It's funny, because I tried to avoid acquiring this game for years, justifying my decision by saying that there were other games that could fill its place in my collection. I finally had to admit that this game was one that was sorely missing from my shelf, along with its glorious expansions.

Alas! It no longer is missing!

Outcomes look to be pretty random. Punish-the-leader mechanisms will make it difficult for anyone to take a significant lead, so everyone arrives at the finish line right about the same time. The winner? Who knows.

A pretty decent game, but the game can be a drawn out a bit, with all the back and forth battles. To the point of not even wanting to play anymore. This isn't always the factor and I had fun playing the game, but I can see the posibility of it being a problem.

I'd play again if friends wanted to, but this is not a game that I would request to play.

This game is great fun with the right people! While it lacks complexity in some areas, which both helps and hurts it, it makes it relatively simple to teach to others..but there isn't anything to stop people from making deals and beating the pants off a single player.

("Shared Victories" between allies is a rule I DON'T ALLOW!)

One major rule: ONLY play this with people who WANT to back-stab and WANT to win!

Simply the most fun I've had playing board games. Even my roommates, who aren't really gamers, love this game and ask to play it constantly. It's simple to learn but complex enough to be good at.

Cosmic is a game I learnt to like after several plays. At first sight it seemed to me a chaos fest with no sense at all, but after several plays during one year, I started to realize that my first impressions were wrong cause I aproached the game in a bad way. The first time I played I was expecting a strategic game, but Cosmic is not such a thing, Cosmic is a kind of party game in the meaning that it works perfectly in a relaxed enviroment, but with quite a lot of room for some interesting tactic options and backstabbing. It is chaotic yes, but is not completly out of control. Avoid it if these kind of games are not your cup of tea.

The bluffing and variable powers are interesting and teamwork and backstabbing is something I always love in games. However I think there are plenty of games that do the social parts of this game cleaner and faster.

What you need to realise about CE is that the game itself is somewhat ancillary, the actual activity is all about the social interaction. The problem is that the game constantly gets in the way of the fun, it's too complex and there's always rule questions. The game is fundamentally unbalanced and asks the players to self-balance, which I always dislike.

A lot of aliens are just boring, which kind of ruins the point of the game. The rules are poorly written which can result in a much worse game due to easily made mistakes. There's a lot of bash-the-leader and kingmaking by design. For example my most recent game ended because someone negotiated a 5th colony from a player that just wanted to go home and there was nothing that could be done about that. It's not the game's fault, but it still wasn't particularly fun.

RATING: 9.6
My favorite game in my collection. It's hard to convince my friends to play anything else!

So much player interaction, so many interesting decisions. Every play can start a rock slide of increasingly ridiculous flare cards and player powers that throws me into a state of wonder every time and makes me remember why I fell in love with the game in the first place. If this sounds emotional, that's because it is. I LOVE this game. The game is based on an extremely simple core mechanic, which makes it easy to teach and easy to get into. The complexity comes from the alien abilities and the cards, which is also where the real entertainment value comes from.

And the expansions are FANTASTIC! I couldn't believe the game could get any better, and then Cosmic Conflict added the hazard deck, which in my opinion is an even better mechanic than the tech deck from the base game.

This game is really fun.  It's not balanced.  It's not a skill game in the way that I typically like.  

It's SUPER nerdy.  Honestly, it's probably the most nerdy game that I have, which is saying something.

I wish they included a 6th player in the box, as I'm going to buy an expansion just for that, as I don't think I'm sick of the cards/abilities at all.  I think with 50 of them, you can play more games of this than most people ever will and not get bored.

This game also has a feel of fitting into a lot of slots in a game night, and it's just versatile. 

Very glad I got this one.

RATING: 10
Incoming ramble punctuated by (hopefully) good points:

Haven't played a perfect 10, but this is my favorite game with the most memorable experiences, interactivity, lack of analysis paralysis, and interesting decisions to make (cards to play versus save, gamble on a win now versus hoping no one wins before your next turn, negotiation and table talk, and reacting to the game's unlimited variance). It has that key factor in games I like: excitement. When players are screaming (happiness or frustration) not just when points are added up, but when a good deal or play is made, I know I've found something that's exciting. 

I've played this game like 30 times and it's always a treat. I've never had one of those horror stories of a 2+ hour game (mine are usually 45-75 mins depending on players) and it's a lot of laughing and yelling. Your success is going to be determined more-so by how you act than how you strategize/play, and I think this is a turn off for some folks. That's a bit unfair to me because I still think efficiency and skill are rewarded (more below). 

People also criticize the randomness. My point of view is part of the fun in the game is figuring out how the randomness benefits some people more than others and then forming alliances against that person- knowing this will shift as the randomness inevitably changes again. So you still get this neat little analysis period when a certain tech/alien power/hazard is revealed, but then it's more about social engineering to get to the next step. 

A lot of play is dictated by the cards you're dealt. Of the 30 ish times I've played, about 3 times someone got dealt a hand that was just a clunker with their alien choices. That sucks and makes the game drag a little for them. But it also opens up creative options - like negotiating to give your hand away so you can draw a new one or positioning yourself in such a weak position that people love having you as an ally while you build back up under the radar. Compare it to a game like Munchkin (which I really dislike) where a similar thing could happen. In munchkin your decision space boils down to "who is winning, how can I set them back - oh shit they snow balled and now we really have to get them." Whereas in this, so many things could happen in the span of a turn that you can create sweet little swings for yourself by pretending to be in any type of leaderboard position (ie winning/losing, strong/weak). In other words, the flexibility of the game state is a lot higher for cosmic, meaning things are rarely what they seem and it again comes back to social engineering to do best.

And if people want to make comparisons, this game feels a lot more like Tammany Hall than Munchkin - but with the sheer variety of aliens and other things, it's hard to make a real comparison. 

However, that's not to say smart card play isn't rewarded. Obviously gauging a player's strength based on previous plays, alliances, and table posturing can help you save your best cards for later. And having a clever surprise to change your trash cards into a valuable swing for you tickles even the most Grinch-like Machiavellis. 

People may say that all this randomness and social engineering I'm praising could lead to a game that's completely driven by luck. That's just not true. For ex: I have winners (including joint winners, another fantastic thing about this game that helps to create a situation where after the game, many are happy, many are grumpy, but everyone is excited about what just happened) sign the underside of the box. As the owner of the game, I've played almost every time. But one friend has played substantially less - maybe half of the 30? Yet his name is on there more times than anyone else! He is just good at this game and at this point it's def not a fluke that he's winning - his skill has been rewarded.

The different power of the 50 alien race include in this game make each game unique.  Every turn, you draw a card to know with which player you're going to have an encounter with.  You can then invite other players to attack with you.  The defender can also invite the other players to help defend his planet.  The attacker and the defender then choose a card to either attack or negociate.  The encounter is then resolve.  If the attacker wins, he and is offensive ally gain a colony on the opponent planet and the defender and is ally ships are destroyed.  If the defender wins, he keeps his planet and is ally can retrieve ships previoulsy destroyed or draw cards.  The first player to establish 5 foreign colonies on the other player planet wins.

Played this game twice, each was a memorable experience.  The first time we played the first played got through his turn and then our host turned green.  He ran upstairs and came back down after an awful fight in the bathroom and had obviously lost.  We decided it was best if we left.  The second time we played one of the guys had the Filch.  We were all new to the game and didn't realize he was stealing cards from the discard deck the entire game.  he obviously won and he hasn't let us forget about it either.

Played only once so far. We had five players, and I immediately saw everything that people both love and loathe about this game. It really comes down to the random nature of the beast - what races you're provided, what cards you're dealt, and what card you draw from the Destiny Deck really determine your success in the game. Any negotiating, or metagaming, you do is negated if the next few draws are against your supposed friend. There's no good way to develop a strategy.

Not that it's necessarily a bad thing. A game like this gives more chances to people who are not so great at developing strategies. Unfortunately, it can go the other way, too, and totally discourage them from ever playing the game again.

I actually do find the game somewhat fun and will play it again, but I do not look forward to the possibility of a game much longer than an hour. When we played, it took about an hour or so to start the second round of play - which wasn't even completed because someone had won by then. A three hour game, given how long the turns are and how random the game could be, would likely ruin a game night for me.

So awesome, but you do need the right group.  Takes a bit of thick skin.  If everyone wants to sit back and get cool cards, the game will drag.  If everyone is out for blood, it will end in 20 mins!  But it always keeps me coming back.

Loved it 10 years ago because the asymmetry was cool and I hadn't yet understood what I do and don't like about games-- I thought the pettiness and backstabbing of negotiation games was just something you had to put up with if you wanted to move pieces around on a board.

Still, the asymmetric powers are cool.

Cosmic Encounter, if you have the right group, is about as close to a perfect game experience as I can find. This isn't about winning. It's about having as much fun as possible. 

I've played with several groups, and it's gone over almost universally well. I found the instruction manual was pretty heavy and weird, but the game was really, really easy to teach. Fantasy Flight did a great job of explaining the different phases, and the bottoms of the alien cards help keep on track.

The aliens themselves add a ton of variety to the game, as well. If you like discussion, if you like chaos, if you like laughter, and if you like fun, I'd highly recommend this game.

RATING: 9
So many alien races, so much replay value. Really a fun, tactical game with lots of decision trees and a unique feel every time you play a different race. Everyone I've played this with has loved it, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. Flares are awesome, tech on the other hand felt pretty underwhelming and I don't think we'll play with it again soon. The social aspect of this game is just an awesome experience all around.

Game can get really vicious with the backstabbing, but as long as everyone has a bit of a thick skin this it's a blast. Lately I feel like we've maybe been too nice about it, lots of co-op wins.

Alliance dials from Eons are pretty sweet. I definitely see how Incursion is marked as an essential expansion between the extra colour, awesome aliens, and the rewards deck.

Have Cosmic Incursion, Cosmic Eons

A game I've been playing for a few decades now, great for any group. Can get a little confrontational, but unlike a wargame, you rarely get to choose who you're attacking, so it's rare for someone to hold a grudge. Fantastic game with lots of diplomacy. FFG version has the best components of any Cosmic Encounter release so far.

Enjoy it, but I think we must either always play it with too many people or too late at night because I usually find myself wishing it was over already.  I think if I play this a few more times in optimal conditions its rating should improve. I definitely enjoy the unbalanced powers :)

RATING: 9
This game is what it is.  It is not a super brainy space epic, nor is it a polished and streamlined gateway game.  It is chaos in a box, and chaos is fun.  With the various expansions, there are multiple modules (not all of which should be played with) and so many different alien races that each game is entirely unique to itself, and thus there is no way of predicting what odd combinations and battles will ensue.  Treat it as such, and you will have an amazing time.

I need to play it more before I'll really know how I feel about. In my only game, one of the alien powers seemed overly powerful. It didn't seem very strategic. If you get a special card, play it. When you can have the opportunity to use your alien ability, use it. I suspect I'll see that there's more too it with a few more plays.

Update: There's just too much going on. The majority of the game time is spent trying to sort out the rules that are in play. It ends up being pretty random.

I knew I'd like this game after watching reviews for it (Tom Vasel's enthusiasm is hard to deny), but man, I really LOVE this game!  The player interaction is superb and the cards bring a lot of tension, but the variety of alien races/powers is what makes this game so amazing.  Though some alien powers seem unbalanced at first, the game really does balance itself out with flare and artifact cards and the fact that players have the option to team up against a leader. Every game I've played so far has been very close and most have come down to all players having 4 foreign colonies forcing the winner to have to defeat their defence with the backing of all the other players as allies.  I can't wait to pick up the expansions.

Random chaos.  Not really strategy.  I wanted to love the variable player powers, but they are not balanced.  CE has a lot of vocal supporters, but the fact that no one wants to trade for it confirms my suspicion that it has louder supporters as opposed to numerous.  Finally traded.

I loved the 'chrome' of the Avalon Hill version, but the fact that it only went to 4 players, had 20 alien powers and there were never any expansions meant that it was a bit limiting... this new edition from Fantasy Flight Games is 5 player out of the box, and comes with 50 alien powers and a new concept called Tech cards.... plus there is now an expansion out that takes it to 6 players and 70 alien powers.

While not exactly like the old Eon or Mayfair editions, this version should definitely appeal to players of those older versions, whilst also attracting new gamers to this fantastic game.

There are some games in your collection that you will lose no matter how well you play.  This is one of those games.  It is unbalanced and silly.

Supposedly players are responsible for balancing this game.  Will they?  Probably not, but lord they will argue!  They will debate, and make deals, and negotiate, and watch as their plans inevitably fail forcing them to redraw alliances and try again.  The atmosphere of distrust is delicious.

Cosmic Encounter is a ridiculous situation generator.  The game is trying to take advantage of less-than-ideal situations.  Actually, the real game is just sitting back and enjoying the theater that results from people trying to create a permanent advantage in a random world.  After all, many of the elements in the game are random, but the design balances this beautifully with a high degree of player control.  You will always have options, even if they are rarely the ones you want.

Perhaps the best thing about this game is that it actually allows team victories, provided two or more players can gain five victory points at the same time.  In a way, this ups the tension.  After all, in most free-for-all style games, backstabbing is never a surprise.  It's just a question of when.  In this game, an alliance is tense because it just might work!

Fans of perfectly-balanced strategy games will find this game frustrating and pointless (which is not an unfair point).  Lawful-aligned characters need not apply.

Amazingly fun game, simple to learn, lots of replay available. Only draw back is sometimes vague rules (understandable seeing that all alien races break a game rule but also break the rules further when they interact with each other)require players to attempt to deduce "legal" rules of plays in certain situations.

Even though this factor slows down the game, it is very interesting seeing how conflicting alien powers affect the game.

End game mechanic ruins an otherwise good game.

Pretty much every game ends in all players blocking early winning attempts while everyone catches up until it becomes a "here's the final question that will let anyone win" type of situation. While there are a couple of unlikely ways, in a number of games of this I've yet to see a way to use skill or strategy to beat the game in-spite of everyone trying to stop you.

Otherwise, the game is good with lots of variations in playstyle from the many characters you can pick.

House Rules: 
1. Draw 4 powers and keep 2. Powers are face down until activated. Player can treat every power as optional while face down. Allows you two pick powers that combo well together, and adds a timing element.
2. Two flares per person, or minimun 10, are randomly chosen and added to the deck. This gives more variety and makes the Super Flare very special and rare.
3. The colors are not colors, but names of fruit; lemon, cherry, blueberry, grape, and brocolli. This was stressed to me when I was taught the game, so I carry on the tradition.

Played this TONS back in the Eon day. So glad to see it redone and done well! Played my first game in 20-some years the other night. Can't say that everyone enjoyed it, I think some of them felt it was too 'brutal'. That is something I love about the game, its basic 'go forth and conquer' mechanics combined with its 'make friends and enemies' social dynamic are just simply fun.

RATING: 10
Love this game! It's very dependent on the group you’re playing with, if you have someone that’s not really focused on playing or treats it purely as a strategy game, it can drag things out and make others lose interest. If you’re with a group that gets really in to the social interaction aspect, watch out! This game gets intense and an absolute blast with more than a bit of tension tossed in. can't wait to sink my teeth into the more complex aspects of it.

RATING: 10
This is a tough one to rate. It seems to be a really good value in terms of all the stuff that is in the box to add replayability and new rules. It's not a terribly cutthroat game, though most of your success will likely depend on negotiating with other players. I love all the powers and the basic mechanics of the game, but it still seems that a very experienced player does not really have much advantage. For a game this long, more strategy would be nice. Still, it's possible the strategies are just more subtle, and it's fun enough to play again and again to figure this out.

Pure negotiation game that requires the right types of players for it to be interesting.  Can have lots of chaos and take that game play.  Was a flop at my game group.

Played 1 full game and another partial with different groups.  Both games went also exactly the same way.  Everyone got to 4 colonies and then it was bash the leader until no one could stop them or two players decided to share the victory.  Way too long of a game for it to end like that.

The true heir to the throne of board games! Cosmic Encounter can be fun a for a broad spectrum of people, gamers and non-gamers alike. Straight-forward enough for newcomers to understand the basic rules, but that all immediately becomes flipped on its head once the aliens are introduced. HUGELY replayable! There's always great tension and player interaction! Cosmic Encounter has led to some of my greatest laughs, and the table talk and politics is bar-none. Good luck to any other board game taking Cosmic Encounter's position as my number one board game of all time!

Enjoy this game quite a bit for its simplicity and the ability to screw over your friends. That being said, as an "angry gamer" occasionally I find the combination of cards and alien power to be utterly overwhelming- in a 3 player game there are races that you don't even need to play the game- once the card is drawn you may as well forfeit because it is going to be over- so that aspect is frustrating.

Not a balanced game, but doesn't pretend to be either.

RATING: 9.5
The highest rated game in my collection. I often use this game as a measuring stick for other games. At once strategic and full of laughter inducing interaction. 

The only other games that rival Cosmic Encounter in terms of addictiveness are Dominion and Star Realms. Almost every time I play Cosmic with new players, it is a watershed moment for them, and many return weeks or even a year later saying that they kept thinking about this game. In the middle of a first playthrough, one player who I was introducing to the hobby stated, with no provocation: "wow, were living in some sort of golden age of board games." 

One caveat: CE is not for people who cannot tolerate heavy and aggressive interaction in games. I had one player become upset because they felt like the energy at the table was very negative, while everyone else was having a raucous time. So more passive players beware.

I've loved every version of this game. FFG's is no different.

However, FFG included several additions and modifications to the game that I think are incredibly good.

- Morph card: This is a brilliant idea!
- A full hand is eight cards instead of seven: This is a subtle change that seems to affect play in a very positive way.
- Tech: Adding an entirely new sub-set of rules to a classic game in its initial release is a daring choice. Kudos!

I played this once a long, long time ago during its Eon incarnation, and never played it again. Now, after playing the FFG version, I remember why. The game is, in my humble opinion, nothing more than a glorified version of 'War', full of chaos and rules ambiguities, making for a disappointing and frustrating gaming experience. After having my colonies decimated left and right within the first 15 minutes, I just wanted the game to end. Who I attack is totally random, as it is up to the Destiny card(s). Whether I win or lose is almost completely dependent on the hand of attack cards I have, which rank anywhere from '00' up to '40', which are added to my attack force, which can only vary up to 4 ships (and possibly 16 ships total if everyone in a five-player game allies with me). We compare the two numbers and that's it--sounds like War to me. Sure, there are some things that modify the outcome, but all of it is completely random and chaotic. I suppose that's what real warfare is, but I got the sense that I really had no control over my destiny. There is some element of diplomacy and negotiation, but I am learning that I really don't care for those kinds of games either. I suppose the additional rules in the FFG version will add some elements, but I don't care for the foundation of the game, so I think I'll pass when this comes the table again.

Update (11/01/10): After playing FFG's re-imaging of Dungeonquest, which was equally bloated, chaotic, and draggy, who am I kidding? I'm never going to play this ever again. Dropping it down to a '2'.

Bluffing, gambling, negotiation, backstabbing, outrageous reversals—this game has it all.  And a thick, gooey science fiction theme to boot!  The rules are simple, almost laughably so, but that's not where the game is.  The game is in finding the most clever way in which to use those rules to your advantage, no matter how bleak the situation.  Taken at face value, it's pretty lame, and I can see why some people hate it so.  Add in a bunch of raucous, cunning friends and the game surprises and delights every time.  I'm constantly surprised at some of the subtle ways "I'm screwed" moments can turn into a big win.

Negotiated (or even forced) multi-wins are great since they keep the playing time more than tolerable (read: occasionally [i]too[/i] short—but what the hell, let's play again!).

PS.  The Broken Token organizer/insert is fantastic—and [i]necessary[/i].  Previously, I had managed to get the entire game with all expansions into the original box (!), but it suffered from the classic problem of such things:  THE IMPENETRABLE BRICK OF BAGGIES.  Setup was an archeology expedition; breakdown a chore.  With the organizer everything has a perfect little place, trays nest neatly, and you can see—and just reach out and grab!—every last deck and bit.

I am extremely delighted to finally put my hands on CE.  I have played it several times before and loved it.  It has everything I like in board-games.  It is light and tactical at the same time, variable alien powers make each game different.  Plus it has optional rules - so you can start with the basics and add additional layers of FUN.  The only bad thing is that I have this game prepared as a Christmas gift for my kids and have to wait another week before I will be able to play it.  

A month later:  a great game which is a huge success with almost all new players.  Tech cards add another nice touch.  

Cannot wait for an expansion.  Hope to see Plant, Worm, Seeker, Judge, Deuce, Wrack, Terrorist, Sniveler, Fungus, Boomerang, Bully, Laser.   

Preferred optional rules:
- Tech
- Reverse cone
- Two aliens per player / hidden powers

I suppose the appeal of this game is the vast number of races and negotiating with other players.

Only played once and could be talked to into giving it at least one more try. But in my one go there just wasn't much fun.

[Note: have no played twice. The second time wasn't any more fun than the first.]

You have no choice over who you attack, meaning this isn't a game with much strategy. But there doesn't seem to be much incentive for people to form alliances either because of how combat works. You can contribute a maximum of 4 ships to an ally but cards and abilities make an order of magnitude bigger impact on combat resolution (with card value up to 40). Whether an alliance worked out or wiped you out seemed to be dumb luck hinging on the initial deal, so why ever risk it?

Combat comes down to blind bidding but the cards go from 0 to 40 (plus Negotiation), though after a few rounds of combat you at least get to know what flares are in whose hands.

Joining in alliances is the only thing preventing lots of downtime in between your turns.

Until I realized, that everytime I played it ever since, it told special stories, it made people laugh, it whet our appetite for another round, it simply granted us a great time!
What else does a game need to accomplish to deserve a perfect 10?!

Played a couple of games now and all were very different.  The first game with 5 people was okay, we had a couple of friends that were more concerned with loyalty to each other than actually winning-so it kinda broke the game.  Second game was good we only had 3 people, wasn't great but good.  Then we played a game with 4 and had a blast!  A super fun interactive experience.  I think this game is really going to depend on the group, on whether or not it will be good.

RATING: 9
Instant hit, since I received it. I love this game. Sadly it has one major flaw, and it is not in the game design itself, I mean it has stood the test of time for decades. But it is in the fact that the game will either be super fun, or super slow/boring/anger-inducing dependent on who is at the table.

The game itself is very simple to understand, and the goal is to establish five foreign colonies on different players home worlds. You are allowed to make alliances to help conquer said planets, allowing people to colonize with you, or they can help defend, and in victory get rewards by drawing more cards. Of course you can both simply negotiate, and trust in each other to do so as well, but once those cards turn over, all bets are off. And here is what makes the game, the negotiation and alliances you make, and of course, break, over the course of the game, and the aliens, which in turn, break the game and allow for so many unique and different games. No game of Cosmic will be the same and each will have a unique story to tell. Some quibbles I have is there are some aliens who are leaps and bounds stronger than others, and some who are almost worthless compared to others. But now with nearly 200 aliens to choose from(with all the expansions) it's easy to just cull those out and have fun, unique, interactive, etc. aliens to choose from. 

Key thing to remember with Cosmic, is that as long as you keep the backstabbing, trickery, guile, etc. in the game you will have a fun time. However, that can't be said for everyone. The rule I follow, is once the game ends, everything said at the table goes with it and we are all friends afterwards, but when anger escalates after the game then we have a problem. This can, and should apply to every game, but Cosmic makes it come out more so due to having someone you trust, stab you in the back while they play an attack card next to your negotiate.  Do not take the game seriously, remember at the end of the day you're all friends and it's only a game. 

Cause of this, I have found the sore losers of my group and the cocky, trash talking, toxic players of my group who I will not play Cosmic, and actually, almost any other game with, due to their behavior. So in a sense I have Cosmic to thank for that, in showing me who the true gamers are, and who the losers are. 

The game is best played with 6 players, so Incursion is the expansion I recommend buying with the base game outright. 5 players is really good, and 4 is ok. 3 I wouldn't touch with a 20 foot pole. 

As far as expansions are concerned if I had to rank them:
*Incursion - Adds a sixth player, and rewards deck
*Dominion - Definitely suited for CE vets, but adds more cards for the rewards deck and really good aliens
*Eons - Probably the most advanced Aliens in the set, suited for veterans, but also the most varied
*Conflict - Great set of aliens, adds another player. 7 player Cosmic works very well
*Alliance - weak set of aliens, but good enough, but not as a first purchase
*Storm- Weakest of all the expansions, Very uninteresting aliens. Only purchase if you must have everything Cosmic

The basic rules seem quite simple, but they play out in complicated ways due to the interactions between the different powers.  I suspect that worrying about game balance is the wrong way to play the game.  It has an engaging take-that feel to it without ever becoming personal (because of the destiny cards) and is basically exactly what it wants to be. (1 play)

More of an activity and social gathering than a game.  Has balance problems that are really only over come by the shortness of play.  If its a bad game it is usually over reasonably quickly and you can just move on to the next one.

Fairly balanced due to the green, yellow, red cards that do more if you know more about the game, but are still on par with every other card.

Just a flat out fantastic game that has stood the tides of time. My work-based game group just loves this one as we can often get in a basic game (no expansions/tech) in our lunch hour.  The sheer amount of aliens available in the box make sure that every game is different - and we always play the blind powers variant to keep things interesting.

Don't see this one getting old anytime soon.

Going in to this game, I had high expectations (it is so many people's G.O.A.T. game) and a lot of fear (never meet your heroes: what if I hate it?). And now? Well, it may be my G.O.A.T. too. This game does so many things so well. Don't like direct conflict? The deck decides for you! Don't like your alien's special power? How about one of these other two hundred! Don't like games that feel the same every time? Don't worry, this one is never the same game twice! Dealt a hand of crap cards? Bluff your way out! Hate bluffing? Muscle your way through! The variety of powers, the back and forth, the shared victories, the negotiation...everything just crashes together and instead of discord, you get near perfection. I absolutely love, love, love this game. Fantasy Flight has also done a gorgeous version of it in the current edition. What a masterpiece.

I LOVE the idea of so much replayability with all those types of aliens! That being said, I don't actually want to play the game that often. It's good, but there are many other games I'd rather play. Even though there are so many different aliens, the game itself doesn't feel that different from one game to another for me. Kind of feels too random, too chaotic and unpredictable for my tastes I guess.

Horrible. No strategy (it seemed entirely dependent on random card draws). Awful bash-the-leader problem, which makes the game last far longer than it ought to. Our game lasted 2 hours but felt like 5, of which 70% was three expert players, and big fans of the game, debating how the broken powers were supposed to interact (obviously, no help from the rules) and working out the only possible way to stop each person in turn from winning (which basically consisted of cycling through the entire deck to get the one card which would do it).
For most games I dislike, I can at least see why someone might like them: this, I really have no idea.

This is basically Munchkin in Space.  The battles are randomly determined and the shifting alliances pretty much guarantee everyone ends up with 4/5 points before the game is over unless someone is dealt a lucky hand.

2 plays in and this is an involved game for all. May play a bit too long for 6 players. Definitely needs someone who knows the game to teach it well. Have to read up more to understand the game

Update: Started off with a barebones game without Alien Powers to teach a 5-player session. And went off with a blast for 2 more games with added Aliens power. Definitely a game that you cannot take too seriously and depends heavily on the group dynamics as well.

RATING: 6
This game is wild chaos.  Players must try to make the best use of their alien race's special ability.  It is zany fun in big groups with several players, each breaking the rules in different ways.  It is entertaining to observe the dynamics of the interaction of the different alien races' abilities.  The game has strong replayablity because there is a huge number of different races and they are very different from each other.  Every play is different from all the plays that have come before.  Some of the races are much more powerful than other races, so it doesn't have some precisely engineered play balance.  I would assert that the broad diversity of alien races and unquestionable imbalance between races is a strength of the game and makes it much more interesting.  Definitely don't pass up a chance to try this game if you haven't played it.  Also, the game deserves merit for fast setup, relatively not too long play time, and fast cleanup.

Very few games have fallen so far in my rankings as I've grown as a player. I used to love Cosmic Encounter. Nowadays, I have difficulty seeing the point in it. It's random chance baked on top of random chance. The parts that aren't random are largely based around trying to convince people that no no no, you aren't the real threat, it's Jim over there! He's the real threat! Add in the fact that very few solo wins seem to come about, and those that do are almost always unsatisfyingly based on how strong their aliens and cards were.

There are some fun memories I have from CE (i.e. stealing the whole discard with classic filch, and then stealing a cosmic zap for the win). If you asked me to play it now though, I'd need to be either really drunk, or really trying to fit in with a new group.

Feb16:

Finally got a couple plays of this classic in.  And yes, it is a classic.  As I understand it, this started the whole idea of asymmetric player powers.

I did appreciate it for the history, and it was enjoyable to play, but I'm just a little hesitant with so much "take that" and free-form negotiation.  Social dynamics likely trump any other input in determining the winner, which can make for a fun game, but not always to me.

Great negotiation game! With all of these different races and different race powers, it has endless replayability (especially with expansion) lots of enjoyment countless possibilities for winning. It is set up on simple mechanics but in addition to these gameplay there are tons of metagaming elements. So it feels unique and extraordinary in every game.

I sprang this game on my beer swilling crowd a couple months ago and i did not have high expectations.  I love them to pieces but they have a very low tolerance for complexity.  Boy was I shocked! They loved it.  Granted we start on the green races but they quickly picked up on the nuisances of the game and loved it.  They eventually held my game hostage so they could play a second game.  I was welcome to leave if i had to go, but the games stays.

I think this is a love it or hate it game, and it's one of the few games I truly hate.  It fits right in the trash can with Munchkin and Fluxx.  Blech.

OWNED SINCE 2011   
This is a fun and unpredictable game. My kids 8+ really enjoy this game. We like how players can "invite alliances" when attacking and defending. We also like how your opponent is randomly chosen. It makes it easier to attack someone without hard feelings. There are a lot of different racial abilities, some of which are difficult to understand and use for the smaller kids. To fix this problem, we simply limit the younger kids to races they can understand and use. The only problem I have with this game is that it's success really depends on your gaming group. This is one of those games where people have to play cut throat and fast. If you don't, or if you have people who constantly making the same alliance, this game becomes very repetitive. This is a social game first, and your ability to talk and convince people is what makes this game work. Because of the age group of our kids it is not too fun and does not see a lot of table time.

Cosmic Encounter is a great game if you like to play with variable Alien powers. In fact this game set the standard for this genre.

Clearly the game not for me.  Simple, repetitive and all in all... boring.  On paper it looks good, but negotiations, alliances etc. turn out to be pretty straightforward and not too exciting.
  I like all these concepts of races with unique abilities and artifacts with special powers, but I'd like to see them used better, in more interesting way.  For me - wasted ideas.

And one element disqualifies the game aside from my personal preferences: shared victories.  They make the game boring and BROKEN.  It's very easy to ally with sb and win collectively.  Thus winning does not depend on the skills, but on the sheer fact if you (or your opponents) managed to ally.  Win in alliance is easy and totally unsatisfactory.

--

FFG version is way more convenient to handle than AH version, which I played too.  It has also many features introduced after the original was released (like flares) so that's a big plus for CE fans, but not for me.  I just don't care to explore the game.

Huge hit.  My friends were obsessed with this game for about three years.  I had to stop bringing it to game nights because it was all they wanted to play.  Aliens are awesome.  I loved it for a long time but got a little tired of it - when playing with more than 3 players it can get pretty slow, with too much downtime in between turns.  I think you need to go into the game without overthinking things and just let it be crazy.  I can see why some people would hate the game.

What an incredibly fun and intense game! My first 3 games were played with all different types of gamers from casual to Euro to Ameritrash and it was loved by all. After each game we talked for 10-15 minutes about great moments and strategies that happened during the game. Then, we looked at the unused alien races and daydreamed about our next play. Because of those races, no two games will ever be the same. And also because of them, I thought the game would be imbalanced (some aliens are way better than others), but that is not the case. The seemingly strongest race can easily lose if everyone is careful and allies against him at the right time.

This game is so weird for me.  I both love and hate this game.  1. I love the game because the player interaction and vibrant feel make it fun.  2.  I hate the game because its so crazy.  All bets are off.  It doesn't matter what strategy you use.  It doesn't really matter what alien you have.  You will win if your opportunity is greater than another player. Period.

Overall incredibly fun.  I enjoyed playing.  Not my favorite. Would play again.

This is a classic game.  The core mechanics are pretty straightforward.  On each turn you point the cone at the token's on someone's planet, you throw in some tokens, both sides ask for allies to join their side in return for rewards, each side plays a number card, the highest total wins.  If the attacker wins, the attacking tokens slide onto the planet.  The first to get five such bases wins the game.  The fun part is the wild array of alien powers and cards and moon effects that add together to a chaotic but fun game.  You basically look for broken combos and steamroller over the opposition or you pull out a surprise move and slide into victory.  In high school we played this non-stop.  These days there are many other games I'd rather play (which are either more amusing or more thoughtful) but it's still a game I would enjoy playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Cosmic Encounter is a game that is broken on purpose. Some players start the game with an advantage thanks to their powers and the cards they hold, even if the score track says everyone is at zero.

It is the goal of the other players to fix the game, making sure the players with the advantages don't win - while still winning for themselves.

It's a unique game filled with negotiations, backstabbing, and savvy play that always seems to lead to moments that genuinely surprise.

It's not a game for everybody and it's not a perfect game, but it delivers a good time that few other games can replicate.

The one word I always use to describe this one is fun! 

Between all of the different alien powers, every game is different. A lot of randomness (you are at the mercy of the cards you draw) may turn off many, but the sheer fun of this galaxy conquering game is well worth it. The relatively short playing time is also a plus.

RATING: 10
You have to go into this game realizing a few things:
1. The base game is okay. Trying to establish colonies on 5 foreign planets is alright.
2. If you do not like player conflict, this game is not for you. You WILL be attacking/negotiating with others.
3. This game relies heavily on player interaction. If you have a quiet, timid gaming group, hopefully this game will break their shells. Otherwise, the game will be dull.

With those caveats out of the way, I will tell you this is one of my favorite games, and you will not have a more exciting time interacting with friends.  The alien powers and abilities, mixed with player dealings is what makes every play through incredibly memorable.  "Remember when Billy asked to negotiate with you so you could both jointly win and he actually attacked you instead?!"

Like I mentioned earlier, this game is not for everyone.  If you are into Eurogames that have little to no player interaction, stop here.  If you are not into being able to trick your opponents with mind games, special powers, or just straight up lies, stop here.  This game sounds very mean, but it is an absolute blast for a light, 30-45 minute game.  Even without trickery or deceit, playing that ultimate combo with powers and cards and laughing in your defeated opponents face, just to have a third player step in and wreck it all, and the fourth player steals it from the third - it just creates those, "Ha!... Oh!... Oooooooh damn!!" moments that you will laugh about and never forget.

Great, great game for fun and exciting groups who are not angered very easily.  Big thumbs up.

For new gamers, it feels like it has a LOT of rules. For seasoned gamers, sometimes they feel like they don't have that much agency. I think a lot of players want to approach it as a space-fighting game and it's a pure negotiation game. 

Too long, too much chaos, too much downtime. Not for me.

RATING: 9
Loads of fun. The game doesn't stalemate as much as you think it would. There are some pretty vicious things that can happen to players in this game.

In addition the combination of alien powers can usually make each game play differently. Of course in our games the ones with stronger alien powers also seem to be the targets of the nastier artifacts, flares, and alien powers.

Hand management is also a crucial element in this game. Oftentimes you'll have 1-2 great attack cards and the rest of them will be fairly mediocre along with some negotiates that you have to decide when the correct time to use them will be.

My rating for this game can vary between 7 (good) to 10 (excellent) really depending on the people I play with. When it's good, it's awesome. When it's not, it's a just an okay game. It can be chaotic fun but it's definitely not for everyone.

This is a tough game with the right crowd, but tons of fun every time! And it is different each time, which I love! The fact that it is growing on my wife adds almost an entire point to my rating (of her, AND the game).

Initial Rating: 7.0 (July 2010)

Cosmic Encounter was one of the first games I ever played when I got into the hobby. I rated it a 7.0 which was a  low rating at the time considering I really liked most of the new games. 

I had some fun playing the game but I never really liked it even though I love negotiation games. I feel I have way too little control, that is, the game have lots of uncontrolled luck with the alien powers and the cards.  Also it has lots and lots of gratuitous "take that", a mechanism I enjoy less and less in my games. 

On the good side, FFG did a wonderful job with the art and the game components.  I really like the alien variety assuring a great replayability factor, however many of them feel very unbalanced.

Bottom line, I don't enjoy the game.  Way too much randomness and attack the leader (guaranteeing a long game). Some of my friends love the game so I could be convinced to play again but I won't propose it ever.

A [b]wonderful[/b] reprinting. 

It's done very, very well and is put together by clear lovers of the original Hall of Fame game.

It's very faithful and you get a lot of goodness in the box. 

Right now, it's still a 9. I'd play this with anyone (casual gamers, friends, etc.). 

It's highly interactive, goofy, wild, and fun. It is not heavy, and that is not the purpose or goal. It's fun, casual, beer and pretzels, and messing with folk--and, it's a classic game that inspired a lot of people.

[b]The new printing:[/b]

I personally love the stackable saucers and I think the individual planets are completely fine. In fact, it makes way for easily expandable planet powers that are easily swapped out.

The game play is as classic as ever. 

The alien art is updated, but very inline with the feel of the old set (I have the West End and the complete Mayfair set).

I'm also very interested to see how the technology addition plays out.

[b]My personal question: [/b]

[Q]Is it worth buying when I have the whole Mayfair set (and the West End game of my youth)?
 
[A]If the gang at Fantasy Flight were to autograph the whole set, I'd pick it up tomorrow; I may still pick it up for the upcoming expansions and the new technology but I need to think on this a bit--should I have a 3rd set of this one game?

[b]My personal lament:[/b]
I [b]wish[/b] this could have been a cheaper game for families, but I do NOT dock Fantasy Flight for production costs or for profit--they're a business. I just lament the fact that many families could be brought into play with a cheaper entry point.


[b]I want this game to survive and flourish. It does my heart good to see this one back in print.[/b]

So after playing about 8 games or so with the same group friends i gotta say the only thing missing in cosmic encounter are more re-enforcement cards its a real shame that battles end so fast. Now the reason im saying this is because after playing munchkin at a friends house it was just awesome fun to have someone re-enforce the enemy as you think your about to win. And it kwl to see how many re-enforcement cards add up it kinda adds more tension.

Other then that the alien powers are great, the tech cards... overall just a really great fun game that me and my friends love to play. ( just a slight feeling something is missing..prob cause FFG wants us to buy expansions arggg)

No idea why this merits a different BGG entry from the myriad earlier releases of the game. 

That said, this is a very nicely produced version of the game - much nicer than my old Games Workshop edition.

Core system is very simple. About 10 million special effects cards (by no means all of which are used in every game) add variety and longevity. It's still very chaotic and difficult to engineer a single player (as opposed to multiple player) win.

Only downside of this edition is that it's limited to 5 players - my old GW set caters for 6.

Overall, good fun and a design that has aged well.

This was made out to be an old fantastic game by gamers in the know, people in my local group were 'meh' about it.  I found it to be somewhere in between.  Played it at Origins 2010 with the 1997 Cosmic Encounter World Champion.  The GM and him did a fantastic job expaining the game and subleties.

Such a fantastic negotiation game. The different races have really great special powers and actually feel different. So much opportunity for backstabbing here. My wife actually asked someone to ally with her in a battle she knew she was going to lose, just to screw him over. So great. Definitely not for everyone, though.

2014-09-03 - Update: I'm dropping the rating of this from 9 to an 8. It's a great game, and with the right group it is absolutely a 9, but it is so group dependent, and many of the people I play with just don't seem to mesh well with it.

2017-11-06 - And it drops again. I think I will probably end up selling this one. It's a good game, but it just doesn't mesh well with my current gaming tastes.

Thanks Tom Vasel for his useful top 100.

Now that I'm giving CE a 10, it makes me want to derate all other games. I'd rate it 20 if I could. It's not a brain burning game, but still, it's extremely fun (something I didn't know it could exist).

Many people (including T.Vasel) report that CE gets broken with 3 players, but We've been enjoing it with 3 players consistenly. Maybe, the key for this is that we play it maturely, and we have no problem about making an alliance with somebody and backstab him later. It's just a game after all.

Cosmic Encounter remains highly ranked after 30+ years and has been reprinted multiple times for good reason: it offers an unparalleled gaming experience. Accessible rules, strong theme, bluffing, timing of making/breaking alliances, dynamic decisions, tactical card play, scores of alien races, etc. Of course, where this game shines is in the interaction. Every session generates memorable moments like no other game. A unique, valuable, and influential contribution to hobby.

Conquer and settlement game that includes the possibility of cooperation. Different races keep things interesting… but the power cards you draw can determine success or failure. And if luck is against you, it's a one round game.

I have watched a lot of the dice tower top ten videos and other videos and I had been hearing Cosmis Encounter, Cosmic Encounter, Cosmic Encounter and I was thinking jesus what is so special about this game, so I take a look and I see just some planet tiles and little pieces, where are the cool armies and ships?

Were is the vast amounts of space to explore and take over, nowhere to be seen...


Fast forward a few months and someone pulls it out at a board game club I am at and asks if I want to play so of course intrigued I say yes.


I won both games in a row and completely understood why it is so great it really does make the game about the people more so then whats going on on the boards, so much interaction.

FFG comes through with another stellar (*snicker*) remake of a classic game. With all the included aliens and optional stuff like tech, this should be almost infinitely replayable. Too bad they didn't make it for 6 players right out of the gate, instead of putting that in a later expansion. 

I've had a lot of success introducing this as a group game to nongamers, several of whom have gone on to buy their own copies. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Alot of fun, but a little too take-thaty for my tastes, and not enough to do or interact with. I always feel like I want to explore it's universe more, but the game's tight focus doesn't really allow for that. Also very hard to explain to new players.

Still, lots of fun.

RATING: 6
There's a lot to like AND a lot to loathe about this game, depending on who you are. I understand those who give it a 10, but I also can see why someone would rate it a 3. For me it embodies many things to love about classic American game design (complex interactions of variable powers, direct confrontation and high interaction, the possibility of unlikely and remarkable outcomes) as well as elements that can make classic American designs weak (no timing mechanic - so wildly different play lengths, not much room for advance planning or strategy, inconsistency of play experience). In Cosmic, the special powers don't just tweak the rules for each player, they make almost an entirely different game each time. There's great replay-ability because of it. Really what sets this game apart from other variable powers games is the ability to form alliances. It tends to even out the imbalances of the base powers, although can increase game length undesirably as players beg and cajole for support.

An objective issue with this game? When a player gets on the verge of winning, the other players gang up out of necessity, so the game drags on until almost all players are on the verge of winning. Even with all the variety in the game, this pattern seems to play out consistently and is hard to avoid.

This is an extremely chaotic game. What little strategy the game has is completely undermined by the destiny deck and the negating abilities of others via race abilities or special cards. On top of that the battle mechanic is essentially war, high card wins. The whole game is about tactical negotiation; I don't particularly care for negotiation so this one didn't do much for me. Not sure why everyone is so wowed by this. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Simply put, one of the best board games ever made.  Cosmic Encounter's simple premise and mechanics makes it extremely adaptable and thus, a similar but unique (and usually remarkable) experience is had every single time it gets put on the table.

If you're looking for a game on game night that doesn't just inspire creativity strategy and social interaction, but REQUIRES these things for one to achieve his/her goal, then look no further than Cosmic Encounter.  For some, forcing social interaction into your games in this way may be a turn off, but Cosmic encounter seems to strike the perfect balance of force vs will.  I guarantee that if you and your company are willing to play within the spirit of the game, you will have a great time attempting to conquer each other.

Over the years I resisted all the various re-prints of CE. None of them really looked like that added that much, but this one looked different. Like they actually did add some useful stuff. I'm really glad I did get it. The additions are all good and it looks a million times better than the mostly monochrome original.

All the Aliens are pretty good, A few I'm not that keen on but no out and out stinkers.

RATING: 7.5
The rules feel too contrived and artificially tacked-on. I especially dislike that there is no natural way of reordering your ships around and the concept of bystanders just seem stupid to me. AFAIK, there's also nothing that prevents 2 people from negotiating colonies to each other whenever they have the opportunity and treating the game as cooperative and be content with a shared victory.

edit: The game is alright, but I think shared victories happen too frequently...

If wonk has a center, it is here, in Cosmic Encounter. Infuriating to players who like machine-builders, maths, multi-turn strategies. In other words: control-dissolving. A game of "giving in", like flying, like death. Hilarious, if viewed from the right location. If I fall into a sewer, some Roman said, that's tragedy. If I see someone else fall into a sewer, that's comedy. Cosmic Encounter is that sewer.

This is a fun game; I feel it was more fun with 6 players than with 7. Since every game the rules will change, there is that off chance that the game will be broken beyond being fun. Aside from that potential for disaster, it's a great game.


Update: My tastes are changing. I will not play this game with random people. Bad experiences have taught me better. This particular brand of negotiation is better than other types, but in the end it's a lesser genre IMHO.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This game is the perfect example of "easy to learn, difficult to master."  Considering how every game you play will be completely different, prior knowledge takes a backseat to developing new strategies on the fly based on the races at play.

Some games can stagnate, some games can even bear little fun...however, for some reason, I want to KEEP playing no matter how poorly the last game may have been.  And keep in mind, this isn't because of the game itself - this is because of the races and cards dealt, how they're played...and how well you can deal with an overpowered and crushing defeat based on a few random draws. 

9 times out of 10 it's a phenomenal game once you overlook any tiny flaws you might find.

I might add, this game is MADE for 4 or more people.  While it says 3-5 on the box, 3 players can make for a truly miserable experience.

No game has been as much of a hit with everyone I play it with. It can be strategically rich, negotiation-heavy, light-hearted and hilarious all in one game. The joint victory aspect is wonderful and helps to mitigate the "attack the leader" problem. The variety present in the alien cards is like no other game I've seen before and each game feel truly different as a result. Just wonderful - I will never say no to this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Awesome game with tons of variety. However, it could be a little unbalanced at times. Some of the races are just too powerful, and a few flares can make someone way too powerful. This is usually self-correcting, as no one likes to have a powerful opponent go unchecked, so I don't knock it down a peg for its balance issues.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A great imbalanced balanced. I definitely enjoy this game, but sometimes it feels more like a party game than a strategy game. The actual battle mechanic of flipping over a card is terrible in my opinion, but it seems to work okay when we're all sitting at the table trying to figure out if this guy is about to play a negotiate or an attack card. The reason I play is the insane amount of combinations of alien power cards. It keeps the game interesting and strategy different each time. Good for fun factor, but it doesn't satisfy my strategy appetite.

I was definitely glad to try this, but it is a type of game I don't really care for. I can see why there is such a big fan base - the wildly swingy special powers surely appeal to many. For me, I'm not a big fan of combat/take that games unless they are clever or over very quickly. As a 45 minute game, this isn't too bad. If I ever knew it was going to take longer than that, I would definitely refuse to play.

One issue with the newer edition is that it seems some of the timing of the artifacts can get confusing to newer players.  I'm tempted to say for beginning players all artifacts can be played at any time.  It was just too frustrating, particularly for the plague card, to try to time it precisely.

Also I have the feeling distinguishing between powers that are "used" or not can be tricky.

Simple alien-conquering-the-world game, but loads of fun. A big part of the game is breaking the rules with various races and metagaming your way to victory. My friends loved the lore and flavor text and ideas behind each race. The theme really comes through very well despite the rules being so easy to teach and learn.

Components are fantastic in the FFG version, and dozens of different alien races combine to make the game's replayability almost endless.

This game has is all...humor, strategy, negotiation, and so much content (especially with expansions) that you won't ever play all the variable combinations. What holds it back from being a 9 or 10 is the heavy reliance on the people you play with. It takes the right crowd to bring out the best in this game.

Just wasn't very interesting to me.  I'm a sci-fi fan, but this one didn't grab me.  I found the base mechanic (attacking and defending) boring.

RATING: 7
You can clearly see that the game could take forever to play, but with the right crowd this is quite delightful. Design has many brilliant choices. I like especially that the game chooses who you're going to attack each turn; strong, but at the same time not too heavy negotiation aspects; that the game is inevitably going to end and can possibly do that pretty quickly. Thanks to a lot of asymmetrical alien powers there's plenty of replayability and making the alien ships stackable is just genial.

RATING: 6
I can certainly see why so many people enjoy this, but there is too much chaos for my taste. I enjoyed myself, but I can't tell if that's because I won or not. My impression is that the game probably works best with players of equal experience. In fact, if an experienced player is playing n00bs, he might consider sitting out and providing advice to the players.

RATING: 8
This is a game I enjoy but it hasn't seen much playing time strictly because I often don't have the group size to make a good game.  It does not scale well for smaller groups and I would never play with > 4 players.  The diversity of alien species and powers is mind boggling and will keep this game replayable until I die.  The gameplay is smooth once you understand the benefits of assisting in attack/defense which for some reason has been confusing in each play I've had (newbies have a hard time understanding this).  My knock on this game is that the end game can definitely drag out.  It appears that most games will come down to most players needing one more victory point to win and everyone blocking everyone else from getting it.  Others have referred to it as the "I'm not winning" philosophy.  Convince others you are behind, get assistance, catch up, then become the target.  Ultimately I hope to play this more.

I have the Eon version with all the expansions, but decided to get the FFG version anyway. Verdict: Good purchase! This is a very social game with all kinds of surprises, twists and variety. The new tech cards are a fine addition. I think it is easier explained to (and understood by) new players from the FFG rulebook than from the old Eon rules. This is a clever game of risk taking and exploitation, all in the name of ruling the galaxy

I *really* don't like this game. The art is awesome and I can see how the game should be fun to play, but unfortunately it really doesn't do it for me. The only time I'll play is if the rest of the group really want to and I really have nothing else to do with my time (a very rare occurrence). However, my husband is a HUGE fan, so it will stay in our collection and, no doubt, I'll play it again in the future.

For such a history-laden game with tons of variable content and different ways to play (or so it's said), a rating after a single, fairly quick game will be very preliminary. I won together with one other player out of five, so did I do something right? Well, probably. Did I get lucky with my power and the way events just turned out? Yes, without a doubt (my power served me well while another guy had a copy power that was basically useless in this setup). I'd have to play more to be able to say how rewarding it is to manage this chaos.

Pretty much Munchkin with much more player interaction, more diversity because of the races, and to cut the play time it ends on 5 points instead of 10 (and you can share a victory)

Negotiation, bluffing and back stabbing also included to some degree

Classic game. Every game is different and always great. Previous experience was with the AH version and I hated it, but this version is well produced and fun.

Simple mechanics along with negotiation, backstabbing, piggy backing and subterfuge. Perfect fun. Better with 4-5 players.

Nice and easy game of space conquest. The ally system tends to lead to some serious backstabbing later on. And that's just the beauty of it. The balance shifts constantly, and keeps the game close 'til the end. The different races are great, but they make you just wish the game would last longer. But the other side of the coin are the fairly simple mechanics that make it impossible to achieve without a "dragging" feeling. Fun and simple.

This game is fun and chaotic but for some people it can be boring at times especially when you have >6 players(not for me though hence the high rating).

Might be even a bit fun with 4 players, but was a complete disaster with 6. Took 3+ hours, but on that time it was my turn _twice_. Amount of meaningfull decisions was minimal (even when your assaults are directed by destiny cards) and game forced a situation where 5 players finished as winners at the same time (as the current player judged rightly that he couldn't win if he didn't take everybody else with him).

Based on 10+ plays.  Wow... that was fun.  The game is crazy, chaotic, and luck-filled - yet I'm a big fan of it nonetheless.  For all its antics, you can come up with some pretty nifty schemes and strategies.

Just be forewarned that it can have a significant luck factor.  As long as you go into the game knowing that, though, it's still a fun experience.

RATING: 9
While this game is not my favorite I still like it a lot. The potential combos you can do with alien power and flair, manipulating others or just seeing someone pull off an impossible win is what makes the game for me. Although you can win with someone else I still try to win alone every game! I absolutely recommend this game. Every gamer needs to try it at least once then they would buy it anyway. Every game is indeed different from another.

2017-08-03 - 7 - Very unusual negotiation game, with a lot of twists and funny moments. The first game took as a while and I didn't feel well that day, so maybe I did not enjoy it as I could - we'll see. It requires a good, open group. We used only green alien powers so far and I really like that everyone thought that his is very strong - I can't imagine what is in yellow and red ones. I really enjoy variant where you hide your alien power until the first use.

2017-08-18 - 7->7.5 - OK, I really enjoy this game. It's funny from the very beggining, when you choose your race and think that you will crush your opponents, while they think the same. It requires proper group though, because it really matters if you involve into the game or not.
The second game went much, much smoother, because I finally understood how it plays.

One of my 10/10 games. The chaotic fun of this one is top-notch.  I really love negotiation games and this one is up there with Diplomacy for me.  This one is also far easier to get to the table... and is more flexible with player count.  It is also FAR shorter to play.  heh  I also really like how everyone is involved almost all of the time, so you are always playing, even when it isn't your turn.  There is zero downtime.

- 遊戲基本來說就是遇敵->遊說同盟->決戰->收成，過程簡單，但由遊說，到最後是否一戰，也是關鍵，感覺很緊湊。
- 可惜節奏太快，對於新玩家可能不知道怎麼回事時，遊戲已經完結。
- 可以創作這麼多不同的外星種族超利害，看看背景也是樂趣之一

I have never laughed this hard playing a game. Last game I was the "Masochist" (lose all your ships, win the game) with maybe a turn away from utter annihilation (and the victory) when my "buddy" dumps "Reincarnation" on me (lose your alien power, choose another).  Of course by that time I'd lost all but two of my home worlds so whatever new power I drew was useless (you must control at least 3 home planets to maintain alien power).... Masochism can be very painful...but a hell of a lot of fun.

Finally got this game to the table. It's got everything I love in a game.  I could see it easily becoming a favorite.   If I had one complaint about the game it would be that the flares were overpowered if you happened to get one or two and your opponents didn't get any. My niece's husband had one that let him take back cards that were played. He had a plague artifact card (too brutal...I'd remove this from the game) and he'd play it and then pull it back into his hand with his flare. I'd probably house rule the flares to be one-time use cards.  But everything else about this game was great.  Looking forward to more plays.

Cosmic Encounters definitely has its charms.  The endless variety offered by nearly endless expansions doesn't hurt it either.

Great game! I've only played it with three players, and I can only image it gets better with more players. 
UPDATE (May '09): After playing with 5, I'd say it's even more deserving of an 8.
UPDATE (Apr '12): I've been getting this to the table more often lately, and the more I play it the more I like it. Having at least one expansion to bring it up to 6 players is a must. It's a solid 9 now, and could foreseeably enter the exclusive realm of the 10s at this rate.
UPDATE (Jul '12): Yup. After yet another epically chaotic game, this guy moves up to a 10.

This beats the earlier versions hands down (I used to own the Eon version, and all nine expansions). The Fantasy Flight version has high quality components, a wide variety of aliens, and refined rules. The powers are unbalanced, but the most powerful alien doesn't always win. Best of all, Fantasy Flight is committed to bringing more to the game with excellent expansions.

For some reason it didn't work as well with my group as I hoped. Rethinking what might have gone wrong:
* Maybe I didn't explain it that well.
* The amount of phases per round might have been confusing.
* The destiny deck feels unintuitive but I know why it's there (otherwise most of the players would just join to win against one other player).
* Maybe my group wasn't that much into the negotiation part of the game.

I mostly like heavy euros and I usually dislike games with too much luck or cutthroatness. However, this is my favorite game of all time. It doesn't feel like you're playing a board game. It feels like you're a leader of an alien civilisation and try to negotiate with other leaders to take over colonies. The card play is simple but so much fun. The replay value is infinitive, even more with some expansions. You're never a leader of the same raze in the same kind of universe. Everyone should at least try this game. Not everyone likes it, but I know a lot of people have this as their favorite game.

I want more. I want to play this more. I think I always want to play this more. This is a really good board game that does it's best not to limit you. You're an alien that needs to land their UFOs in other planets, for what? Up to you (obviously other than the games objective). But how you do it is what makes this game interesting, use diplomacy, strongarm them by destroying their ufos, do whatever it takes to spread your little UFO babies. 

P.S. I finally picked this up because I played Game of Thrones version and enjoyed it. So I thought I would enjoy Cosmic Encounter, and I ended up loving it.

Let's get this straight: Cosmic Encounter is extremely random at its core. But like any good game with a high degree of luck, there are key mechanisms which allow players to exert control over it. In here, players mitigate luck through diplomacy and treachery.

Because, don't get fooled, Cosmic Encounter is all about negotiating, bluffing and backstabbing. This is no space conquest game, not by a long shot. The distinct alien species and their powers are mostly chrome, though they also inject the game with a good dose of variety and unpredictability. What each special power does is give the player a tool to mitigate luck, by allowing him a greater degree of control over a specific in-game mechanism. But, in the end, games will be won and lost at the negotiation phase.

Cosmic Encounter is weird and chaotic, yes, but that's precisely what makes the game unique, as its chaos can be harnessed with diplomacy. And backstabbing.

39 years late I discover Cosmic Encounter, and it is quickly becoming our go-to-game when having friends over. Playing for great mechanicisms is nice and fun (as with most Euros), but having the social experience of the chaos that is CE is where it really is.

[size=12][b]Why I like Cosmic Encounter:[/b][/size]
+ The huge variance in Cosmic Encounter (especially with the expansions) means that each game should be different.
+ I am not a fan of games that lack a consistent set of rules. Cosmic Encounter has variable player powers that change the rules but I do not consider this mechanism in regards to this complaint. In short, the game seems to have a consistent set of rules. 
+ The games I have played did not drag on.
+ There are decisions to make.
+ The game has high replayability with all of the different ways the game is set-up.
+ I can tolerate the mechanics

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Cosmic Encounter:[/b][/size]
- My main criticism is that the game is not balanced. They cannot have tested all of the different alien interactions. Therefore some of the games work well and others are a waste of time. In one of the games I played two players formed an alliance and won the game without any of the other players getting a turn. The other players hence wasted their time playing that game. I am currently deciding to rate this game based on the games that work well otherwise I'd be rating this a 1.
- The game is somewhat hard to teach to new players, especially if they are played with an advanced alien.
- The game has variable levels of players involvement

[size=12][b]VERDICT:[/b] Sometimes willing to play this game[/size]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun enough to play, especially with some casual players, but definitely has some balancing issues. Some alien races are fastly more powerful than others, and the card system makes the game very chance based. Nice things are the play time and setup are relatively short and there are  many options as far as the alien races go. The alliances aspect is fun as well, and is constantly in flux.

RATING: 4
I can definitely see what is likable about this game, in many ways it is very interesting with loads of strange alien powers. But its way too random, especially the encounter cards varied strength that often negate everything else like using your powers well and managing to get everyone on your side and then you lose because the other players got 40 strength card.

If you like chaotic fun with loads of take that attitude than maybe its for you, if you are like me and like strategic planning stay away.

RATING: 6.5
I'm a bit ambivalent on this game. Yes, it's a fun game, but the games do tend to drag on. When you start this, each time we expect it to take no more than 45min. We have yet to finish a game in under 2.5h.
Still, it's fun when we do play it. It just requires way more time that you'd expect.

EDIT: Recently played it again with 5, and I actually like it more now. Not one of my favorites or anything, but it's more fun than I remembered.

RATING: 8
Cosmic Encounter is a game I always love to play.  It is certainly not a very strategic game, but it makes for some fond memories.  With its expansions, it is playable by very large groups, and it often serves as an enjoyable alternative to a party game.  The hundreds of alien races ensure that no game ever plays the same as any other.  Components are top-notch, rules are fairly simple to learn, and gameplay is fast and chaotic.

This is the first edition of CE I've ever played, and I really like it.  FFG should have done player aids similar to what DOW does in their games (Small World, Cleopatra, etc.), but other than that, they did a great job.  I think the scalable length & complexity give it huge replayability, and the reasonably quick pace & high interactivity help keep everyone engaged.  Most of my plays have been 3-player games with my kids, which is not ideal, but I'm calling this a 10 anyway.  This is currently (2009-10-31) the game I want to play with them most.

A classic American non-wargame design, which is pretty much nuff said. While I every now and then can enjoy a totally random game which forces the players to negotiate, bribe and blackmail, there's too big of a chance here that the setup just makes it "we gotta kill that guy because he's got a too strong race/flare". Then the card draws might give you a chance to do that or not.

The saving grace is that it plays in under an hour. If I ever have an experience with this that proves me wrong, the rating's going down.

I can see that how the joy one gets from playing this game could be highly dependent on the group they play it with. That said, if you play with the right group, this game can be great fun.

I've nearly bought this game on several occasions.  I was taught it by Kevin Wilson from FFG.  I think the thing that keeps me from purchasing it is the simplicity of the actual game mechanics.  I understand the draw of all the different powers available in the game, but that has never been enough to get me to pull the trigger.

Easily be the best game I've ever played. Such a pity I don't have many chances to play this game (it's hard to gather 5 players in my area).

---

Update 12/7/2014: Well after a handful of games that left a bad taste in my mouth I have to say this game is really player-dependent. It really drags if people refuse to come for a joint win. Also sometimes you are given a hand of cards that is really unplayable and demoralizes you to the point you don't want to play the game anymore, especially when you have only 1-2 colonies and several people tie for 3-4 colonies. Then again, sometimes you get an unexpected win after a long grinding, but I just wish the game was a bit shorter. 

Also own the 3 expansions that give +1 player, just too lazy to list them out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
In Cosmic Encounter, each player is the leader of an alien race. The object of the game is to establish colonies in other players' planetary systems. Players take turns trying to establish colonies. The winner(s) are the first player(s) to have five colonies on any planets outside his or her home system. A player does not need to have colonies in all of the systems, just colonies on five planets outside his or her home system. These colonies may all be in one system or scattered over multiple systems. The players must use force, cunning, and diplomacy to ensure their victory.

My life would be meaningless without 'Cosmic Encounter'. It's the best game I've ever played. Period. It's weird, chaotic, unpredictable and just plain awesome. You just need the right people (open minded, talkative and no-tryhard alpha gamers) and you will have the best hours of your life. Got every single expansion, everything sleeved and a custom made carpet for a playmat. If I could own just one game, Cosmic Encounter would be that game. The materials are great, the artwork is fantastic and everybody who doesn't appreciate the beauty of Cosmic Encounter can kiss my ass!

Classic game of interstellar combat.  Easy to learn.  The recent Fantasy Flight edition comes with 50 different alien powers and it is very easy to find hundreds (or thousands) more on the web.  The FFG version is a max of 5 players, but a rumored expansion should add more.

I'd rather my social games to allow a greater range of expression, my negotiation games to have novelty of communication, and my strategy games to have skill.

Played once, won, removed it from my wishlist. 
I feeled like the cards were way too random and powerful. What is the point of negociating alliances for 4 supports per player max, when you can draw a +5 and your opponnent a +40 ? 
What is the point to not being able to choose who to attack ?

I love backstabbing, alliances, strategy. This is too random. 
I might give it another shot, but disappointed.

Meh, so much hype around this.  It's a fun game with lots of player interaction.  To me, it's somewhat too complicated to be a "party game" and yet too chaotic and goofy to be a serious game.  It's a "nerd/geek party game" maybe =)  Anyway, there's fun and laughs to be had, but you can't take this seriously, regardless of what the hardcore fans will tell you.  It's "bash the leader" all the way with a huge bias towards smooth talkers and a good potential for sparking fights amongst friends =)

This is the second time I play the game. I played the older game and gave my first comments there. Playing a newer game did not helped improve the game.

Now I am going to say something a bit offensive:

"I would be more excited to play Snakes and ladder than playing cosmic encounter."

Yes the game is that bad.

At least in snakes and ladder, I could be excited to roll high while in cosmic encounter, if you start with a shitty hand, that is all you are going to get for the whole game since there are little ways to draw cards.

You might say that cosmic encounter has much more decisions to make than in snakes and ladder. In fact yes, you have more decisions, but I should rather say, you have an illusion of decision. 

Most of the time, when you have a choice between A and B you get in situation where either the choice is obvious or whatever the choice you take the result is the same. So you are not taking any decisions at all. So I would say that in a game, you will take an average of 2 to 5 decisions.

Now in order to camouflage the bad game design they have added tons of special abilities to make sure that every game is so different that you won't realize that the core mechanics are bad.

Special abilities could be compared to rolling 3d4, 1d4+1d8, 3d6 keep 2, instead of rolling 2D6. They all have various odds, but it the ends it gives almost the same results and it is always the same crappy game under it.

So a very horrible game where I really don't understand why people like it.

Fun, chaotic game that is different every time due to varying alien powers which will alter the game in many different ways.  I'm uncertain how I feel about the very wide range in values for attack cards but that's just part of the game I suppose.  In either case, the game is generally over within 45 minutes to an hour and that's an acceptable time frame.

This is THE edition of Cosmic Encounter. Everything is top notch, the artwork, the components, the clarity of the rules. It is the greatest game I have ever played. It really does go to "11"

[u]Comments Update:[/u]
CE is by far and away the greatest board game that has ever been made. If you disagree with me I'll play my Cosmic Zap and then you will have to agree with me. There, I am glad we got that out of the way right off the bat. FFG has done an amazing job of updating this classic game and making available to thousands of new fans all over the world. The chaotic game that inspired hundreds of other designs really shines through. True to its form CE is never the same game twice, and is the only game that has caused me to name a few of the epic sessions I have played in the past. CE draws out the player and forces them to be able to adapt to the game in front of them, and the players around them. I will never ever tire of playing CE, and for that it gets the Special Game Award for Awesomness for 2013.

Cosmic encounter on mäng, mida kindlasti on vaja mängida õige seltskonnaga. Mäng ise on hea, aga mis teeb ta lihsalt heast suurepäraseks on mängijate vahelised interaktsioonid, mida mäng lubab. Mulle meeldib hästi mängu põhiidee, et kui kõik mängijad on overpowered, siis ei ole keegi overpowered. Jääb mulje, et isegi kui su kaardid on üsna saastad, siis võid ikkagi võita, kui piisavalt hästi teistega diplomaatiat oskad teha (loe teistega manipuleerida).

RATING: 8
A classic.  I don't know of any game like it.  Very interactive.  Lots of laughter, and of table talk.  Often leaves me desiring to play a meatier game right after playing it (where I would feel more in control of my chances of winning).  But I have a soft spot for such a unique, interactive, and varied game.

The FAQ would require a FAQ: some answers are not very clear (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/497563/better-review-of-faq-1-0-more-errors-than-origin).  Similarly, the text on the cards has not been thoroughly proofread (compare to Magic: tG, where errors are extremely rare, comparatively).  The French translation is not written in a perfect French.  All in all, I feel like FFG (or Edge) did not do an excellent job.

The components are fine, but not top notch (compare to Mr Jack and its nice wood, its thick cards and mounted board; compare to Space Hulk 2009 and its compact cardboard; compare the style of the cards to that of Magic: tG, or RftG; the style in CE is "old"; the insert is made of relatively thin cardboard).

The rules are relatively clear, but leave some obvious missing parts.

First play: I would recommend to make up for the teaching time by using the 4 planets/4 foreign colonies variant.  Having the Encounter deck "statistics" player aid was great, I believe: players were able to better gauge the strength of their hand.  I think that I should mention that the hand goes back to 8 when you don't have Encounter cards, so that people can strategize with this fact (like: I don't care if my lousy hand gets depleted…).

Advice:
- For new players: 4 worlds for the first game PLUS telling the players that this is an *introductory game* may be the best way to play.  The upside is that the game does not last too long despite the rule explanations.  The downside is that players have fewer chances of using their power and of experiencing nice situations.
* Rule explanations:
- Go through one encounter, with only the Attack and Negotiate cards as an example (all 3/4 combinations).
- Show the page with the distribution of cards, so that players get a feel for what they will get.  Emphasize the fact that CE is a card game: most of the military power comes from the card, not from the ships.
- Mention the other cards briefly.  Show and mention that the Cosmic Zap might be particularly useful, and that any player can play it; this can be a way of making allies, of negotiating a truce with the recipient of the aid, etc.  Since the other cards are quite clear, they are mostly self-explanatory, and players can start sooner to play.
- Mention the fact that the 
- Have everybody read his power aloud (mandatory or not, short and long text).  Thus, players get to know each other, and will be able to make better decisions.  Players can ask questions, at this point.  Since they had the encounter example, they know what the phases mean.

Jeder Spieler spielt eine Alienrasse, die versucht sich im Cosmos auszubreiten.
Wer am Zug ist zieht eine Karte, auf der beschrieben steht, wen er anzugreifen hat. Dann darf er belibige Spieler einladen mit anzugreifen um Kolonien zu gründen. der Verteidiger läd ebenfalls Verteitiger ein um seine Kolonie nicht zu verlieren bzw. die Helfen bekommen dafür Handkarten/Raumschiffe.
Beide Spieler spielen verdeckt eine Karte und decken sie gleichzeitig auf. Die Zahl der Karte wird zu der Anzahl der Raumschiffe addiert und die höhere Summe gewinnt. Dabei gibt es noch ein paar Sonderkarten die es unberechenbarer machen sollen.
Wer 5 (4 im kurzen Spiel) Kolonien besitzt, beendet das Spiel. Wer die meissten Kolonien besitzt gewinnt es dann.
Alles in allem war ich doch recht enttäuscht von dem Spiel. Ich dachte dass da mehr Diskussion herrscht, mehr Intriege, hinterhältige Absprachen und nicht eingehaltene Verhandlungen... Das gab es schon und die 3-4 Momente dwaren recht spaßig, aber leider lange nicht so gut/viel wie ich anfangs dachte. Schade eigentlich!

I know I'm supposed to love this game, but I've played multiple editions of it and none of them do much of anything for me. I just don't find it fun or interesting. Whenever I mention it I've been told I'm playing the wrong edition, or the wrong rules, or I need to add this element, or take away this element...I suspect the main thing is that to enjoy it I need to have fond memories of playing it for hours in my dorm room back in college.

I just bought this game and totally understand why it has a following.  The powers and plays cause HUGE swings in the game and I think that "lack of balance" is the appeal.  I'm very anxious this more and see all the different alien races in action.

Temporary Rating: 8

I like it very much. The strategies seem endless, but I've only played 2 games and with the basic game rules (without flares and/or artifacts and only with green aliens). But some things I think did seem aparent at least in the few games:

1. The game seems too fast. both games I played ended in only about 40 minutes. I guess the adition of deeper strategies will fix this, also the negotiation thng didn't clicked a lot on the first game, so I also blame the overpowerness of the "Parasite" power in the first game. 
2. We lost lots of ships in the two games. This, I think, was because we didn't grasped the strategy involved in the encounters in the first games.
3. The card rules were the most difficult to learn throughout the game, there's a lot of exceptions and rules that are apparently easy to learn but with the flow of the game they're lost, like the fact that you only have the 8 first cards in your hand.
4. We missed (most of the time) the rule to have a second encounter when we won the first one on our turn.

There's a lot involved in Cosmic Encounter, but I am willing to learn it all and my group seems enthusiastic about the game and all it's possibilities too.

EDIT: I've posted my definitive rating, I might change it when I play with the yellow and red aliens and when I include Technologies to the game, but 9 seems a really good reating for this game and I'll tell you why:

This game is awesome. I just played with Flares, Artifacts and the deepness and variability becomes noticed in every way. The subtle variations to the game rules become really big when you know how to use them to your favor. For example I was playing a game where the Sorcerer was used and the player explained the power. When I saw that player using a Negotiation card and turning it against his enemies, I knew that this was the kind of game I love. 

All the rules are subject to breaking in every manner, and that's somehow refreshing. 

I haven't even used half of the options on this game and I already love it. I can't wait until my next game!

Edit:

I have to give this a 10, I just have to. The interaction of powers, the variants, the flares, the negotiation and the relative quickness of the game are some of the things that make this game awesome. I'm up to the yellow level on aliens and it gets more and more interesting. The sheer amount of possibilities is what makes me want to play more and more, Some of the interactions of powers are so awfully insane and hilarious that I can't really wait to pull this game out of the shelf again...

This is the game that is played the most since I bought it. We leave tech cards out, nobody thinks they add something, this doesn't change anything. This is THE 10.

The interactions between the aliens makes this game, you will never get the same game twice, even with some same aliens, as all the players together make the game. Some aliens might look overpowered but in this game this will almost cause this alien to be the main target, making it less likely he will steamroll through the game.

So far the 'Human' has a 100% win rate. Very surprising as at first sight you would throw him away.

So many epic games that stay in the memories, this is why it absolutely deserves the maximum score.

RATING: 9
A very solid, deep, high octane game. I love the high social interaction, seat gripping excitement as the encounter cards are turned over, random card zaps, and just epic plays. Aliens are all unique and game is high replayable. Almost could be a 10 if the game had a much better rule book that tackles/gives examples of special scenarios and if the rules were more clear in certain conflicts. A little complicated but very fun.

Just shy of a 10, but still a very solid game.

RATING: 9
What can I say that hasn't already been said? This game redefines "overpowered" and makes it awe-inspiringly fun. As I have said more than once at parties, Cosmic Encounter balances upward; every race of aliens has what feels like game-changing abilities, and the entire tempo and balance of power can hinge on a bizarre error caused by one person forgetting what sort of insanity the guy to their left can unleash. I've seen games where sure victory was snatched away by an assaulted planet suddenly exploding, where a person willed themselves into losing by swapping hands with someone who was holding onto a garbage hand due to a single valuable flare, where I literally did not get to take a second turn because everyone was so scared of my aliens that they didn't stop the aliens sitting to my right from establishing colonies. Negotiation is at the core of this game, but it's also very random, and I personally find that to be a fun, peanut-butter-and-chocolate sort of experience.

This game has a ton of different races for different powers. At its core its a pretty simple negotiation/hand management game. I feel like the game is not completely balanced but definitely prefer how there are a ton of races rather than having a few balanced ones. I wish the cards did not have such wide range of values though, as half the time the number of ships you use for combat doesn't really matter as the card is more important. Would definitely rate higher if I was a fan of negotiation games.

this game has been around for 30-40 years, there must be a reason for its success...

I think the fact that we have 50 races in the box which are so different to each other is amazing. The gameplay itself has no downtimes and is really fun.

RATING: 10
This game is phenomenal. I picked it up after a bunch of professional reviewers suggested it (e.g.  Shut Up & Sit Down, Dice Tower, etc. -- Go watch their youtube reviews). I will expand on this review later but this is another game I can play with my non-serious gamer friends, who find games like A Feast For Odin and Power Grid absurd and over complex, and my roommates (who are serious gamers) freaking love this game and, in the days after it arrived, my roomates and I would play it until 4am every night . 

Pros:

>This game is simple and I can explain all rules in less than 5 min. 

>This game is fun, in almost every game I have played.  Everyone has laughed a lot and immediately asked to play again. In fact, I have never played a single session of this game, every time I open the box, I play it at least twice before putting it away.

>This game is more replayable than any other game I have ever seen. With 50 alien races out of the box, which all play the game differently, you will most likely never play the same game twice - especially if you get an expansion. 

Cons:
> Some races are better than others, which can make the game un-fun for the other people at the table
> Will add more here - running out of time for writing.

While I love my Mayfair Edition and will pull it out to play with the Cheese moons, reverse cone and kickers it cannot hold a candle to the new version. The new and original designers involved have out done themselves with this edition: stripping away all the additional stuff we just didn't need, then having the stones to add in a completely new mechanic! 

What's more, the graphic design, illustration, components design and durability is far beyond my expectations of board games in general.

Looking for Fantasy Flight edition.  I have the AH edition and modified it for up to six players.  CE was way ahead of its time, and anyone would be hard-pressed to come up with a better negotiation game.  Add in the wacky powers and you've got a fun-filled gaming session.

The game is fun but where it falls a bit on is the fact that, while all the races somehow are "broken", most are way overpowered.

One of the few games from the 1970's that is worth playing today.  It is a pure negotiation game with radically asymmetric powers for each player.

Not a fan of this game. When it's not boring, it's frustrating. For such simple rules, the game is simply overwhelming. It builds waaaay too much on player interaction, diplomacy, arguing etc. hiding the fact that underneath that social kerfluffle it has a pretty mediocre mechanic.

I'll play it occasionally if asked to, but wouldn't suggest this myself.

This game needs a good group to shine. In a fun setting it really let's the interaction of friends rise to the top, using the game as a catalyst. This is the marking of a great light game.

RATING: N/A
Great mechanic. Not concrete (very abstract), lots of negotiation, bluffing/lying, and heavy interaction.

Seems like a fast playing RISK game mixed with negotiation element (DIPLOMACY) plus the insertion of bizarre characters makes it seem a tad like a CCG/Domaine-type game, but nevertheless VERY fun.

Worth playing someone else's copy until Small World and Nexus Ops have been played more. Perhaps consider Nexus Ops team play.

Each games is varied and different (like SMALL WORLD).

CONS:
-- doesn't play with 2 (however there may be a variant - which doesn't seem to have much appeal); okay with 3 (HOWEVER, Sweet spot is repeatedly said to be 4)
-- has a fantasy/space theme (but not too overwhelming)
-- expensive
-- Some cards are SO overpowering that it can make the game seem unbalanced (unfair)
-- BIG CON: Can promote teaming up (especially in a 3 player game)
-- BIG CON: Because of the cutthroat aspect (similar to Diplomacy) it rewards folks who are outright liars (while this may make the game exciting, it certainly will hurt feelings and can potentially create ill feelings)

PROS:
-- very dynamic
-- lots of interaction; encourages a lot of communication
-- very fun
-- the game has been around for 30 years

NB: The older Avalon Hill version of the game can frequently be found for under $15. However, the new FF game has Alien cards which SIGNIFICANTLY improves the game play and strategy and fun factor

Good reviews: Fun seems to be the overriding theme (even though the game can be played with more strategy): http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/547153/one-of-the-most-fun-games-i-ever-played-even-thoug)

Like a more interestingly-themed Diplomacy, but every game's different since you have 50 races to choose from (just in the base game).  And it auto-balances since you have to get help from other players (like Munchkin), so the weakest player will be getting help and not messed with.  As a result, kinda meh about it, would play, and only maybe would get just because interaction is always the best kind of play, and super simple rules make it great to show complete beginners how fun board games are, and there's so much variety.

Bought it a guy from CABS for $30, brand new, which was awesome - randomly saw his post on FB.

Traded away at Origins'16 Math Trade. Works really well for both players that need a bit of guiding through strategy, or want some interaction without serious diplomacy (gotchya' play). Just didn't get its hooks in me or the group, though.

RATING: 1
The gaming equivalent of "madcap" comedy. Massively unbalanced (albeit deliberately), vast amounts of luck, and can drag on for ages (2 hours on one excruciating occasion). I have given this game a few chances, but all it has delivered are some of the most unpleasant gaming experiences I have ever had. I want to make meaningful decisions and have influence over my own destiny, rather than have the whimsical vaguaries of group politics and negotation completely determine the outcome... and if the outcome must be down to those things then the 'game' needs to last 30 minutes at most so I can move on to something more interesting.

There is no substance to justify it lasting any longer, with probably the most abhorrent feature being the lack of control over who to attack on your turn. This is the one game I absolutely veto in my regular gaming group. It's a bit like gathering around a table, and taking it turns to say 'I would like to win, will you support me?' until someone gets bored and agrees (that would be me, at first time of asking). I'm just astonished it is currently top 100. If you want to play a negotiation game then I'm the Boss! is much better, i.e. it actually functions as a game.

Not really a strategy game in my opinion, but loaded with interaction and tactic decisions. Most of all it is tons of fun playing it and it finishes with in an hour. There is a fait bit of randomness in the set-up depending on what alien you aquire and the attack pods you recieve, but then it mostly come down to the tactical moves if you win or not, even though you might have to go for a combined win with a superior alien. 
The replayabillity is huge and two games seldom are alike, even with the same aliens present. 
Defenitely worth a try when provided the oportunity.

This game -needs- a group of players that openly trash-talk and secretly plot the demise of their opponents. Negotiation is key, but that might turn off the quieter gamers. Not a problem for me though.

Just one of the best game ever!  Infinite replayability.  Setup/break down is quick if you keep it sorted in box.  A game can be anywhere from 45 minutes to 2+ hours depending on number of players and their play style.  It's hard to imagine people playing this game and not having fun.  I think I can take this into any room where people are willing to play a game and show people a good time.  I took it with me on a Christmas Eve to a fairly formal dinner a few years ago.  At first people were scoffing at the idea of a board game on Christmas Eve.  ...We still play the game every Christmas Eve and we still talk about games years later.  ..It's THAT GOOD!

Terrific. Technically I'd say probably actually a better game than the Mayfair version, but I have such fond memories of Mayfair and FF doesn't approach the level of chaos that playing with dozens of moons can create. Which doesn't make for a good game, but makes for a lot of fun. I highly recommend this version.

I've played the game twice in big groups and was both times the last player in turn.
The first time, the game was over before I even had a turn, the second time I coud do one action.

Seems like an interesting system. I generally like games where players have different basic abilities and goals. Especially in this case they make things fairly complicated in a good way.

RATING: 10
Own this and Cosmic Incursion, Cosmic Conflict and Cosmic Storm. 

The game doesn't work for everyone, as it requires a lot of talking and interacting with the other players. If you and your group do not have a willingness to deceive and be deceived, have things shatter around you as you try to make a plot last till the end, then it might not be for you.

If you do, then this game offers basically infinite replayability. Every single game can be different. One game might last 20 minutes, the next one an hour. No two are ever really the same. As you get to know the game, more strategies unfold and you can start to use the knowledge to bluff other experienced players into thinking something completely different is going on. 

A gleeful, playful gem of a game that hasn't gotten old, even after what I can only guess at is around 200 playthroughs at the time of writing. 

Highly recommended!

This one was love at first play!
Dozens of alien races - guarantees the replayability - and all of them fairly balanced. You have to think a little different in every new game regarding your abilities and you must not forget to continuously readapt to your opponents' abilities.
You don't get the feeling that you achieved something meaningful, but, nevertheless, it's just pure FUN. It's, also, great - and easy to grasp - for kids.
The only complaint I can have is that it can drag too long with 5 or 6 players. I think 4 is the ideal number.

Cosmic Encounter is the perfect balance of silliness, negotiation, hand management and role playing.  It's really easy to learn, the idea that who you attack is not determined by the player (generally) allows the game to have combat without the "anger."  I also really like that you can have multiple winners and regardless of the outcome, I always remember the crazy interactions and rarely who won.  Lots of fun, great with 5 or 6.

This game is chaotic, but not too much. It feels unbalanced, but not always in favour of the same player. It rewards attacking, but being attacked can be quite rewarding as well. Moreover, this game can also be won with negotiation and clever use of the various powers, technologies and artifacts -- without ever having to win a single fight!

Me encanta Cosmic Encounter, pues creo que en verdad las posibilidades con él son infinitas. Hay mucha negociación y la interacción entre los jugadores es extrema; por lo tanto, no hay una buena estrategia para ganar (o por lo menos no la descubro aún). Tenemos catro expansiones, por lo que la cantidad de razas asegura que nunca se juegue una partida igual y eso me encanta. Es muy divertido y me da pena no haberlo jugado más.

Despite so many aliens, games... eventually start feeling the same. Which is ironic, considering the main point of CE is that it should never feel the same. Downtime starts getting too high once you add a sixth player, and is nigh-unbearable with seven.

Still good for a bit of fun once in a while.

UPDATE: Sold this game to cover Game of Thrones: The Iron Throne.  Due to the poor quality aliens and being such a hard game to teach to newcomers, I just couldn't bring this game to the table as often as I like.  GoT: The Iron Throne is far easier to teach, more strategic, with far more backstabbing involved.  While it only has 25 powers, they are powers that actually make you feel powerful or have some merit into the game instead of garbage powers like "Butler"

I went into my first play skeptical, having burned out on the original back in college and not played it in years, but this version surprised me. It moved quickly, seemed like it was going to be over rather soon, and then went all pear-shaped and got interesting.

It's enjoyably social, and I love that the initial decision -- who to attack -- is generally made for you. Lots of twists and turns, and tons of variation in pretty much every encounter.

It's not My Jam to the Max, but it's fun.

Lots of phases in a turn (i think 8) but simple and fast to execute. Combat is easy, super trump card style (bigger number wins over smaller number). A bit heavy on card management plus you need to keep in mind which phase a card may be played. There are tons of alien races with varying effects and difficulty (in usage) to choose from so I think replayability is pretty high. Its rather quick too (although it took us a while earlier since there was a lot of text to read).

I instantly liked the game due to the high variability of special powers and backstabbery. I was originally going to rate this a solid 8.5 or 9, but the appeal has slightly diminished since then.

There really is nothing new to see in the mechanisms, but they work together well enough.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
A masterpiece of a game with near infinite variety.
The base mechanism of the game is as simple as can be : pull a card to see where you're attacking, choose how many people you want to send, and ask other people if they want to join. Then play a card with a number, highest total wins.
Where this game goes from "meh" to being a masterpiece is all the different alien races you can play. In the base game you have fifty. Each of the three expansions that are currently available add another twenty. The next expansion (Cosmic Storm) will add another twenty-five. That's a total of 135 different races, each with their own gamebreaking rule.
Now, you may think that with that many races it would be impossible to properly balance them all, and you would be right. The balancing actually is on the players who will gang up on the more overtly powerful player making this game a contest of negotiation and politics.

4 / 5 - Great.

Most of the fun of a big multi-player civ-building game stripped down to its bare essence and crammed into an hour or so play time. The different powers keep the strategy interesting and add spice to the negotiation element and there's just enough screwage potential to make things fun without being overly nasty. Constant need to gain new allies each turn means every player is involved in every encounter so downtime is virtually nil. Slight question mark over whether turn order is an overly big determinant in the winner, but lots of fun whether you win or loose. Could well be a 10 on repeat plays.

RATING: 8.99
Old school gaming and a rather streamlined space conquest game in it's purest form. The huge vast number of races offer endless replay but each race offers limited amount to take in so it's easier to manage despite players likely having to learn 1-2 new races every time they play.

What separates one game from another and the really good games from the classics is dynamic gameplay that leads to stories over the years. This game has it in spades. There were multiple moments when something would happen and one player sat there stone faced as they tried to figure out how to counter what just happened, and the rest of the players were laughing. That's the kind of game I want to play.

I really want to nitpick this game to find a weakness, but I think that's just personal opinion getting in the way. Part of me wants more complex races, but the reason for the simplicity is due to its age as a game and it works well enough as it is. Easily the best play of DaveCon 2012. That's between 16 games for those wondering.

Updated ranking based on researching about king making issues. Need more plays before I feel stronger about where to rank it.

Rating Potential: 8-9. Just need plays of full games to see about the king making issues since my one play was a partial play.

This is quickly moving up the charts. I may have to put this in my top 10. Even with just a single expansion there are so many combinations of cards/alien powers that the game will never play out the same way. The alien powers are in no way balanced so if you are expecting that, this is not the game for you. It's very a backstabb and conflict type game but that's part of the fun of the game. Go into this with a light heart as competitive play is not the style of this game.

I love this game, the fact that the game forces you to attack players every turn takes away a certain awkwardness from board games that can make you feel like a dick when you play very agressively. The deception and dynamic formation of alliances really makes this game fun. Also, I have never played a match of this game where I had a bad time, it is one of few games where even if you are losing, you can have a great time and you still have value to contribute to the rest of the game.

I had heard lots of great things about Cosmic Encounter.  For awhile I was on the verge of buying it myself.  So, when I finally had the chance to play it I was excited.  The theme sounds super fun: intergalactic warfare with shifting alliances.  Great!

But then I played it.  I've never felt more like a game played me, rather than I played it, than when I played Cosmic Encounter.  Every turn I MUST attack someone, I have no choice.  The draw of a card decides whom I attack, I have no choice.  How I go about attacking the other players is largely determined by my race, I have little to no choice.  Whether I can support others in their attacks or defence is ultimately up to those other players, not me.  I'm constantly being told by either the game, the other players, or both as to what I can do, how I can do it, and when.

The only choice I have is whether I'm going to play a number or a negotiate card.  Sorry, not good enough.

RATING: 9.9
One of my favorite games.
True negotiation/diplomacy classic, very few games are relevant 30+ years after their release. In my collection Survive is only other game that's as old, traditional cardgames aside. Both games have had very nice anniversary editions (in case of Cosmic Encounter, FFG) that are also their definite editions. Small minus is that you need Cosmic Incursion to complete it (6th player), but the expansion also comes with some new aliens and very nice Rewards deck so.. ok. Cosmic Encounter is almost perfect game. I wish it was slightly less complex (I guess there's Munchkin for that, underrated game on BGG, but it's also missing most player interactions of CE and isn't as replayable in my opinion), but as it is, it's pretty much for gamers only, even if you leave flares out. That's fine, you can try to lure heavy strategy gamers to try this one. As far as 'gamers games' go, this is easily the most fun one.

Expansions:
+Cosmic Encounter: Cosmic Incursion
+Cosmic Encounter: Cosmic Conflict
+Cosmic Encounter: Cosmic Alliance
+Cosmic Encounter: Cosmic Storm
+Cosmic Encounter: Cosmic Dominion

RATING: 7
Was very keen to try this.  After first play, I'm not sure what to make of it.  The game was overly long and took a while to get our head around the rules / strategy.  The rules book could have benefited from a more detailed discussion than it had.  Depending on how competitive the game is it can run for a long time due to the victory conditions.

Will play again and then decide if it is with holding in my collection.  Fun game, but has a tendency to drag due to not having a fixed end game (skilled players have a tendencey keep in other in check).  I may greatly vary my rating of this with further plays.

Played with 5.  Much better than with 3.  A very chaotic game.  Really hard to control one's fate. Would play again, but no desire to keep this in my collection.  Plenty of other games I'd rather play.

It's good. There are a ton of different alien races, which adds variety. Some powers feel decidedly more powerful than others, though. The luck of the draw will end up deciding more games than actually building alliances. The sheer number of different races doesn't really mean a lot of replayability, in my opinion. The replayability is there, but a lot of it feels so random that each individual variable doesn't seem to matter that much.

Not for everyone, but was a staple of my college days, and the only reason I don't play more now is because I don't know enough people who play.  The number of possible interactions make every game different.  Do play with two powers per player, though.  That's what makes the game truly interesting.

RATING: 7
Good
Large variety of aliens to play, each has unique mechanics that makes the game feel slightly different each time. 

Quality components. The ships, cards, cardboard stock are all solid and look visually pleasing. 

The game tends to self balance itself, so we haven't had any runaway leader issues. 

Bad
The game has solid mechanics but this has a Munchkin-like feel in that you have to recruit other players in order to win. In the limited games we have played it has been group wins, where the couple of folks excluded were the ones playing to win by themselves. So it felt unrewarding all around. 

I have watched several gameplay videos/reviews on this game and there must be something that isn't clicking with my group. Because of this I would like to give the game another shot, but perhaps with some vet players to see how the strategy pans out.

First two plays were completely hilarious. I would like to play a lot more of this game. It's obviously not the type of game that you take too seriously as there are quite a few gotcha cards that you can't really plan for. The negotiations and joint wins make it a lot of fun.

Only played one game, but would play again in a heartbeat. 6 player game, everyone level one colony from the end and somehow I managed to blag may way towards a joint victory.

There is so much potential depth and replayability that my only concern is that there could be alien clashes where some outright trump another. But even then I think it would still be fun to play.

It took me a long time to finally purchase this game, because i just could not believe CE could be THAT good.

CE is _SUPERB_

It has so many combinations to come across. 
The card play adds intense mind games to the mix.
The diplomatic aspect offers nice back and forth.

Every game is a story and you will be talking about CE games for a long time.

RATING: 9
I was very uncertain about this at first, but now I adore this game, and the Incursion expansion (with its Rewards deck and extra alien races) has made this a favorite. I don't even mind losing. I just enjoy the experience almost every time. Not a 10 ONLY because the wrong collection of aliens or the wrong set of players can make the game a serious downer. But, a bad alien mash-up is very rare, and, with the right people, this is among my very favorite games.

Fantastic game!!!
I've been trying to get my hands on a copy for a month, and finally got a copy.  The first time we played it was without flares, and only the green alien cards, which was good.  But the next game we added the flares, and it was AWESOME.  Non-gamers may find the flares a bit complicate.  LOTS of variety. 

Update: After playing it with different groups it still hasn't lost it's appeal.  I still want to play this game, over and over again.

This game can go either way. On the surface it seems to be not all that interesting and with just way to many options for races and powers. With the right group of people it becomes a mass of bluffing and negotiating and working to keep the leader down. If your group doesn't understand that social aspect of the game, or their are inexperienced folks it can fall flat. When it works with the right group, its one of the best games of all time. If it didn't require the right group, I'd rate it a 10. As it stands, there are some groups I wouldn't always want to play it with.

This game, over and over, has been my favorite to play, to teach, and to experience.

Each time I play it, it gives me a story for months to come.  I can tell you each of my victories and defeats and how they came to be and who I pissed off and who was my friend until they weren't.

Do not get this game if you like to sit quietly by.

Negotiation + screwage = fun!

Rating rises from 8 to 9 after 7 plays.

The rulebook is astonishingly clear.  It unambiguously explains the game in a logical order and it's easy to look stuff up during the game.  It's hard to believe it's from Fantasy Flight.

The components are very good, with one exception: the score track.  It's very fiddly and as the warp tends to rotate a bit in normal play it's sometimes inaccurate as well unless you remember to adjust it whenever you touch the warp.

RATING: 3
My comment before i played was "Political and too chaotic? Not sure if I would like." I was dead correct. The mass and total chaos of having your cards taken away from you before a negotiation and having someone else dictate if the "Loser" wins just made this impossible to do any kind of planning.

Haven't played the new version yet, but my memory of the old one is that it was the greatest game I'd ever played.  Extremely simple core rules, but made mind-bendingly awesome by the scores of alien races you can play as (and different every time!)

RATING: 5
Tenuous - group hasn't taken to it, living on borrowed time

This is a very fun and good game for the sort of game it is. That is, a highly interactive (both on the table and above it - talking, cajoling, negotiating, begging and coercing your fellow players), chaotic (your hand of cards and the distribution of take that effects, the many alien powers, the destiny deck which decides what player you must attack), silly (again, the alien powers for example) sort of game. I can see how this game makes for poor sessions, how it really ends up with people saying "... and people say this is fun?" (only worded so much more strongly).

However, with the sort of group that takes it and runs with it, for me that would be my childhood friends, accepting the chaos, laughing at the wacky way they were just screwed something horrible, the malicious glee of backstabbing someone just because, then the game becomes a great vehicle for fun. And I like that. Its exactly what I want from the game (not every game, just the game for these sorts of occasions, see circular logic - I don't care), just something that facilitates a nice time - that can make people laugh at silly things even if no alcohol is in the picture. 

This game does that better than any other I've tried. If I am to mention negatives I'd say the worst are: 

a) this is that this falls in the category of games that is very hard to teach people not used to games - the style of game where you have the rules, then you have all these cards and abilities that break them and that's the game.

b) the way the game is prone to the ending of all players are on 4 colonies, making it drag a bit, making it feel less clever because of it. Though typically even then it's the player who I'd say "did the best" who ends up winning, for what it's worth.

A great game!

This is meant to be a fun game, not a brain-burner, but like many games, it depends greatly on having the right group to make it fun. I have had fun playing it, but after three plays it is not something I want to come back to. At its core, the combat resolution is not very interesting (totaling ships plus combat card values), though the special powers and action cards -- which in such great numbers give the game incredible variety -- is where the combat is really decided. For me it is too much. I don't like chaotic rule-bending, which this game has in spades. A typical encounter: "I have more, I win." "Oh no you don't, because I have this special action card!" "But wait, my special action card cancels yours!" "Not so fast...!" Sigh. Does anyone want to play a game that is actually a game?

Played FFG edition. Loved it more than any previous. The mechanics are brilliant in how they deal with forcing attacks (and randomizing who is being attacked), the possibility of shared victories, and built in "replayability" with the alien powers, flare cards, and technology. And lots of player interaction kills downtime. A fun game that plays differently every time. Only drawback, if you can say it is a drawback, is that it really needs 4+ people to play and enjoy it fully. You can play with three, but it is a different experience and can turn lopsided in the asking for allies portion.

Once you build a base on a planet it's fairly safe there which makes the game play at a good clip since it's all about forward momentum.

The new reprint of Cosmic adds a lot of great graphical changes without going into crazy AT-style chrome.  Same exact gameplay style, updated to look amazing.  Tons and tons of races to choose from, so that deducing the interplay between your race's advantages/disadvantages makes for fun times.  Conflict-based, sure, but not overly difficult to grasp.  Gets lots of folks around the table into the gameplay.

Fun until everybody is one point away from winning and then the game devolves into either waiting to draw a card that lets you win or "giving up" and going for a shared victory with one random player losing

RATING: 7
gobs of chaos, but a decent (potentially fantastic) experience.  winners can easily come out of nowhere.  endless variety.

can easily bog down if you allow too much table talk each turn, or if all players try and work through the available permutations each encounter.  

i can only see playing this with 5, maybe 4.  with 3, although i have never played with 3, it would seem pointless.

Maybe the boardgame I own that I have played the most. Hugely replayable and a social game, almost every game feels different because of the alien powers. How much fun you have will depend on your group, to unlock the full potential you need a group that likes to interact.

Somehow a must-have game for me, even if I almost never play it and have yet to play my own copy (it is sleeved though...).

Maybe I should also get the remaining expansions... just to have them.

I think I like the whole style and "look and feel" of the game. The balancing and gameplay are not perfect, but it is fun. 

Minus: People settle too easily on 60% of the players sharing a win.

Possibly the best negotiation game ever. 
The fact that you can't choose who you attack, having to go against someone depending on chance is brilliant and really helps the game flow. The powers you can have, which depend on which race you get, are so vastly different... and fun! And yes, they are not balanced, but that's what the negotiation is there for (in part): someone got an incredible power? then don't help them when they attack, anbd ally with the player who gets to attack them, or don't negotiate with them...

So much chaos, but sooo much fun!

Way too random and chaotic if all the expansions and associated cards are added in and stirred together.  

Using fewer of the expansions might be better I think as the additional cards dilute the basic Encounter cards like Negotiate and Attack cards with a lot of junky and funky situation specific cards.

Less is more I think... might still rate the game a "6" or "7" if the game was pared down to the basics.  But for now, the game is too chaotic and random for me to enjoy in it's present state with everything thrown in.

The good news... with the FFG edition, players can choose pretty much how they'd like to play.

The negotiation (and backstabbing) game with no equal. An event game, and one best played with gamers willing to go the extra mile in roleplaying.

Expect to lie to your best friend, team up with your worst enemy, and have both roles (and alliances) rethought every single encounter.

Another 'essential' game -- if you're in any way interested in designing game, Cosmic Encounter is a *must play*.

Way too much luck involved, my 2nd & last ever game of this was totally powerless with the crap cards in my hand.

A party game and popularity contest disguised as strategy. Though unlike most party games it isn't really fun. Games regularly end with two players in first place negotiating the victory. Incredibly random and stupid. You could even kingmake in the end and just give the victory to one specific person out of spite. Filler filler filler.

I know the random elements and unpredictability are supposed to be what everyone loves about the game but it left me cold. I don't mind the negotiation and backstabbing, but ultimately I felt like nothing I did really had any consequences because everything would be upended anyway. Felt a lot like Munchkin now that I think about it - a whole bunch of 'wacky' stuff happening, sometimes good for you, sometimes not, and then eventually someone wins (usually a half hour after everyone is officially sick of playing).

An okay game, munchkin style, throwing cards at the table to see who wins the battle, saving some stuff up near the end to win or prevent someone from winning.

Hard to believe I've never played this classic, but after a handful of five player games lately I finally see what all the fuss is about. The rules are loose in that old-school way that encourages players to define the experience themselves (negotiate is a prime example of this; it's a design choice I think most modern games would shy away from) and the alien powers provide great variety without adding too much difficulty. I could see how this wouldn't work for some- the game is all direct conflict, so if you're uncomfortable with that (as many in my various groups are, including my wife) you could have difficulties enjoying the game, and I do think it ran a bit long for my tastes. All that said, I'm looking forward to playing again.

The granddaddy of modern board games. It involves competition, cooperation, bluffing, bargaining and strategy. Players take on the role of aliens with special powers, all of which are useful in their own way.

I played with my brother once, and late in the game he said he had been stealing cards all along. We all got mad at him, until he told us that he had the Filch flare card, which allowed him to steal cards. It was a genuine surprise, and he had played it beautifully.

Fantastic game. Highly recommended.

Bit of a miss for us. We can all be pretty extroverted when we need to be, and are no strangers to having an argument or negotiation, but this game just got to 4 colonies each then everyone screwed each other over until someone finally got lucky to get the last point. The end game felt very similar to that of Munchkin. That game seems to get slated here, but apparently it's cool to like Cosmic Encounter - I just don't get it...

Very random, very swingy, very fun.  If you want a balanced game, you are probably looking in the wrong spot.  The trick to the game is looking to see who can do what and then try to plan/swindle your way through the game and try to come out on top.  Some races are much more powerful than the others, but that's just part of the game.  Very fast to play though, and my games (even with up to 6 players) have only lasted an hour or so.  As any negotiation game, the players really make the game.  With the right group of people, this is one of the best...with the wrong it can be very stale.

Reissue of the old classic. Each player plays a different alien species with one special rule-breaking ability. Races have encounters with other players and attempt to establish colonies in their planetary system. Battles are card driven. The rules are fairly simple.

Cosmic Encounter feels pretty chaotic. Between the cards you draw for use in combat and the cards you draw that tell you who to attack (what the hell?) it's a bit too random for my liking.

RATING: 7
Hysterical fun, infinite re-playability. I am absolutely shocked I overlooked this one all these years, and the FFG reprint makes it brilliant. I will never ever refuse a game of this, and find myself suggesting it before anything else.

Here's why: as light as it seems, and as easy as the rules are to master, this is a game that almost purely focuses on the metagame. Each round, as allies are called for and opponents weigh the likelihood that players can beat another, a rich experience of meta-game awareness develops and the negotiation, at least in my playgroup, is intense, ornery, and hilarious. Add to that the fact that a five-player game is done in under an hour and we find ourselves playing game after game in a row, shuffling and dealing out new powers, mutliple powers, playing with hidden powers for those "gotcha!" moments. It's just plain a blast - other than Diplomacy, some of the most fun I've ever had playing a game - I laugh, I cheer, I get pissed off, I get revenge, I threaten, I bribe, I make and break deals, I do nasty backstabby stuff (like call for allies insisting aloud I can win and than play low cards to intentionally lose), and I still cannot get enough. For the price, this is going to be years and years and years of endless fun with no chance of burnout. Love it.

-----------------

Edit: this game is an absolute smash hit with the teenagers at the high school gaming club I sponsor. The only other game that got such an overwhelmingly positive reaction was BSG, but given that this plays so quickly, it was an immediate success and there was instant demand for more more more more more. And to be clear - this is an ideal game to play with them - enough metagaming and negotiation to keep things interesting for me, but enough crazy chaos and comedy to give them a fighting chance against me :devil: Ratings bump to the top.

------------

Note: this gets played almost every week in gaming club and I always sit in on at least one or two games, so I have several unlogged plays of it.
------------
Though I never get tired of this, I do have to admit after hundreds of plays (so many I don't bother logging them), that it's only fun with the right group, which is somewhat of a tick against it. I will always want to play this and say yes to it, and with the right people it's a ten. With the wrong people, it's closer to a 7.

Played once with 5 players.  Game seems really dynamic with variable player powers, however not being abe to target the leading player was frustrating for some in my gaming group.  Played with green and yellow alien races - the "tick tock" player was not quelled early enough to prevent a win.  Next play was with 4 players - much more parity.  Game seems to do better with players of equal experience and understanding of the game (moreso that most other games).  Just starting to understand the draw of this game.

One of my favorite games due to the way it forces social interaction among the players. I love the fact that alliances are constantly made and broken, but due to the game deciding who must attack who, there's never any hard feelings. Great theme and, with so many alien races, every game feels unique. At roughly 90 minutes a game, it's just long enough to be satisfying without becoming boring. The only downside is the rare occasion when certain race combinations are drawn that draw out the game past its welcome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
+2 replayability off the charts. with the combination of different alien races, it's basically a new subset of rules each game.  
+1 Love the artwork. and there's so much of it. Normally a half-pointer for me, so a full point is a lot. 
+1 Has great depth of strategy (deep but accessible), but mitigated by having the weight to match, with reasonable setup/learning time and rule complexity. 
+1 the bluffing mechanics and alliance elements in the core rules, combined with a lot of card effects, create a social element to the game which is awesome. 
+.5 there's so many mechanics that the theme isn't truly immersive - but the fantastic artwork, flavor text and variety of species do give it some sense of theme. 

-2 (up from -1) As I play with more groups, I see that the mandatory, direct confrontation in this game really seems to put a lot of players off. It seems not sufficiently softened by limited negotiation options, compensation and non-confrontational aliens. Infinitely replayable games are less fun if you need a very niche group to play them with. 


-.5 There's an element of rules lawyering which is necessary to fully explore the depth of this game - which can be jarring. This is mitigated somewhat by the crystal clear rule-book/alien cards. 


Fantastic game, with rules that seem light - but basically a new set of supplementary rules each time you play, depending on what aliens each player draws. The interplay between these rules makes the game truly great. Not for the faint of heart though.

Ich weiß das Cosmic Encounter in vielen Toplisten hohe Platzierungen hat. Bei mir will der Funke noch nicht so richtig rüberspringen. Okay, die Regeln sind eigentlich relativ einfach, bieten aber auch ihre Tücken. Damit will ich sagen, dass es nicht so intiutiv zu spielen ist, wie man vielleicht glauben möchte. Die vielen verschiedenen Alien Rassen und ihre Fähigkeiten sind ohne Zweifel cool, jedoch stört mich die enorme Unausgeglichenheit. Manche Fähigkeiten sind unglaublich stark, wieder andere eher wertlos. Das Spiel steht und fällt mit der Kommunikation und Interaktion zwischen den Spielern. Wer verrät wen? Wer greift wen an? Wer verbündet sich mit wem? Bisher waren die Partien in Ordnung, aber auch noch nicht die große Offenbarung.

RATING: 9.5
Spectacular!  The rules are so simple anyone can play.  However, it is the alien powers, negotiation and aliances formed between players that make no two games alike.  This game has near endless replayability.  Unlike some, I think this game plays just as well with 3 as it does 5.  Every collection should have a copy of Cosmic Encounter.  It's a classic for a reason.

I really wish I would have known about this game when I was in high school or college, I think it would have been played hundreds of times. The amazing thing is, I can imagine that after that much play it still qpuld have variety left to offer! This game has quickly become a staple in our group, which is fine by my as it combines so many different elements of gaming I love into a single package. Will definitely play this one for the rest of my days.

My group is handling this game "okay", but prefer to avoid playing it. We're still getting used to the scope of negotiations and what information you're allowed to say. Otherwise, I think it's a fun game. Very compact and decent art. My friends don't like the game because of how many OP aliens there are. They prefer inherent game balance (instead of changing everyone's strategy to gang up on the OP guys). Edit: We ended up using a variant where everyone gets two alien races (1 visible, and 1 hidden until revealed). We actually play this from time to time because of that. They find it bearable now! Lol.

RATING: 7
Cosmic Encounter is a great game, if you accept, that your influence over the game is somewhat small and there is a lot of randomness and take-that elements involved. Also the aliens are not at all balanced, so players need to work together against a strong oponent (Yes, unbalanced powers is a plus in this game).
Unfortunatly it is too long. Almost every expansion adds new players, but I think 5 is more than enough (better 4). The game and the downtimes get too long with more players, even leading to games, where the game is over before everyone had a turn.

I could not fit everything in the original box, so I use the box of "Shadows of brimstone" for this one, including all the expansions.

There are many expansions and the sucker that I am, I got them all, knowing that I will never be able to use all of the new (and old) content.

I have nothing to say against the beautiful new totally playable edition from FFG.  Kudos to all around!  But I think after playing throughthree editions I have to admit to myself that CE is just not my kind of game.  Too much chaos and randomosity.  Not a bad intro game, or a quick beer & pretzels game (only if it's quick!), but it in no way reaches the stature of Dune, and there are better games to be played for the same investment.  Too bad: I really thought CE would "reveal itself" in this peerless new edition.

I hate Cosmic Encounter Endgame in much the same way that I hate Illuminati Endgame and Kill Dr. Lucky Endgame. In essence, games with small scoring tracks where most players get to the cusp of victory at around the same time do not feel climatic to me, they just feel random.

Early game Cosmic also feels weak to me. The midgame is wonderful, though.

-Discovering new aliens for the first time

-Very player dependent
-Too chaotic

Love the game, some of the cards and aliens are just really funny and create those excellent "WHAT?!" moments. The mechanic where you have to play every card first before you get new cards is just lovely! However, I definitely don't find it as genius as a lot of people may want you to believe.

If people don't form alliances it can be quite boring for others to just watch encounters, and some people really dislike having multiple winners (I know I used to hate them). Also, some cards and aliens are really difficult to understand, which surprised me since I consider myself a heavy gamer. This leads into a yet another thing: lots of unclear rules, which can ruin someone's planning which is frustrating.

The positives I mentioned in the first paragraph also kinda disappear once you get to know the game. The lovely "WHAT?!" moments are almost entirely gone once you've played through all the aliens and the card management becomes uninteresting when you realise you're almost always at risk of a opposing negotiate, and then (I found) it's best to just play your most powerful cards as soon as possible so the others can't snatch them. This leads me to have... kinda no positives anymore.

In the end though, it does things you won't find in any other board game in terms of unique, special powers. However, after several playthroughs, the game just doesn't surprise me anymore (that's about 10-15 plays though, so if you find that worth the money, go get this!).

Longest game night of my life. The idea of the game isn't that bad, but too many ways for people who don't have anything to do with the attack to muck up the whole thing. The entire game was controlled by two players who messed up what everybody else was doing whether it would help them or not.

Excellent production of an old classic. I used to have the Mayfair version and its expansion and have played it more than 100 times. This new version from FFG, in addition to the obvious improvement of the quality of the components has also added small but important changes in the game. The feel of the game however remains the same, that is, light and chaotic fun with some elements of tactics that reward skill to a certain extent.

I know this is a divisive opinion, but Cosmic Encounter has really been replaced by Munchkin at this point. Both games involve negotiation, player powers (inherent or otherwise), luck of the draw, and occasional cooperation, all without the shared winning conditions that Cosmic has. That all being said, I do like Cosmic Encounter, and objectively-speaking, I do feel it's a more refined game. I just feel that it's a little overlong for what it is, and the player powers are a tad more convoluted than they ought to be. For such a minimalist game, however, it really brings out the negotiation and backstabbery in a strong way.

EMBRACE THE WHIMSY - THIS GAME WILL AMAZE


Played 3 games in a row last Saturday night. It is easily my favourite game I am yet to play. It definitely takes a specific crowd to play it, but when it gels...IT IS HILARIOUS fun.

Also, I need to talk less...people gang up on me :P

------------------

I had my first bad game of this earlier this month. Honestly it all came down to the fact that I had not yet lost and EVERYONE at the table was determined to make sure I lost, so while it was fun for them it was not much so for me. I can't blame the game for that though - just my friends :P

RATING: 3
The most impressive thing about Cosmic Encounter is its legacy. Unfortunately in a post-CCG world where "rules on components" is a given, the game does only shine as a demonstration of the truth behind most ameritrash designs: you don't even have to try to create a fair game, because no matter how screwed up a given setup might be, no matter how much one or two players look like demigods or cockroaches compared to the rest of the table, free-for-all conflict and bash-the-leader negotiation will balance the game for you. From that perspective, we're facing a game that, once all the complicated interactions have been solved and everybody understands the pecking order of alien powers in a given setup, is simply about lying on the content of your hand.

RATING: 4
I really really want to like this game, because I bought it recently, and it wasn't cheap. But the gameplay feels slow, there aren't any interesting mechanics, luck seems to dominate all decision-making, and the only tension in the game comes when you're flipping over your encounter cards to see who happened to pick the larger number. As far as I can tell, it simply isn't a very good game, and I'm not sure why it's rated so well here. 

I'm willing to give it more chances, and in fact the time I managed to play with five people, there was a glimmer of fun. But with three, it's simply a dull experience. Many of the alien powers aren't exciting at all, and alliances don't mean anything in the long term, which bothers me a little as well. It seems flawed, and while it looks great and I love the components, it doesn't save it for me. Hopefully I find something in my next few plays to raise the rating from a 4.

The new 2008 version of Cosmic by Fantasy Flight Games. Having only played the basic game of this, the only rule changes were 1) the addition of reinforcement cards of value 3, allowing main players or allies to play them after cards have been revealed, and 2) the destiny deck has more variety on who you can attack. There still is a ton of luck, but the game plays quickly, and is over in under an hour. It's a great game for 1977, but it shows it's age.

Tom Vassal's tom pick out of 1500+ + Fantasy Flight + few or none expansions yet so I don't feel like I have to catch up = board game I must get. I'm not usually into the Sci-fi as much but I like it enough that I should have more sci fi games than just 2210 which is just painted-on sci fi

Update: played it online and though I liked it more than my group AND it was online I definitely see the weaknesses of this game really apparent. I simply don't think it's worth getting even if its 2 more points than our gameplay was.

In person, with perfect mood, perfect people, and great atmosphere I could maybe see this moved up to a 5.6 experience.

For a game that's purely competative like this one, it's remarkable how poor some of the balancing is. That says I admire this games accessibility and quickness for what it is.

I really don't understand the intrigue with this one. Alien powers and cards are totally imbalanced and the turns are too limiting to perform anything meaningful (forcing you to attack players, really?).

Better off with the Game of Thrones re-implementation.

-Played once with basic rules-

Definitely not bad but then again... it won't blow your mind away (I guess).
It's random, quick and funny but something is missing.
Too 'eavy to keep the pace up, too chaotic to try and make some sense out of it!
For example cards add some unnecessary weight and slow things down a bit (why didn't they use dice anyway)
and while everyone should attack anyone the rules -by using the negotiate card- allow room for alliances (negotiate at will would be funnier).
On the same time, many races to deal with, short enough to enjoy a couple of games a night and anyway I can't find anything else to blame an honest, clean more than decent boardgame.

A largely chaotic and very fun game.  The Destiny deck controls who you must attack, so even if you want to lay waste to someone else, you may or may not be able to.  This doesn't mean that you have no control over your alliances, as that is where a lot of the game centers.  Some good twists to be had there.  The sheer number of the alien races creates a lot of replayability in this game, and I can see myself enjoying this one for a long time.  Good job on the remake FFG.  Thank you!

Totally pushes all of the wrong buttons for me. I have heard so much about this game over the years and finally had a chance to play it with the FF version just released. The one positive thing I can say about the game (other than the expected high production value of Fanstasy Flight) is that it ended fairly quickly (though it still wore out its welcome). Variable powers may have been an innovation back in the day but it's been done much better since. Player's have too little influence on the outcomes of the battles so it becomes just a guessing game heavily controlled by who has the better cards and/or power. I would rather give all involved a differently-sided die and then roll off to see who wins. Argue if you will about the social aspects of the game, but that part is also just another ingredient of luck thrown in the pot. Consider me unimpressed.

The new FFG treatment is extremely well done.  I avoided Cosmic Encounter forever because I was intimidated by stories of out of control powers and rule ambiguities.  Having most of the timing issues addressed directly on every single card makes FFG's CE very easy to bring out to new players.

I must play it more times so I can judge it properly. The only time I played Cosmic Encounter was also the only time in my short game life in which I made a move to crown someone else - who happened to be my wife - so the game could end. Since it's highly praised by friends I respect, it deserves to be played more, so, maybe, I learn to love it.

Really fun and cut throat game. Don't play this with people that get really upset when people gang up on them (no hard feelings, just going against that person is the best play to get your points). 

Lots of races to choose from so there is a lot of replay-ability.

I'm a bit on the fence with this one.

The first time I played this was with 5 players and it was amazing! It was definitely a 10 at that point.

However since then I have played it 2 other times with 4 players and it was simply okay. I'd probably rate it a 6.

I also played about a half of a 4 player game with some people that aren't as big into heavier games and it was a total nightmare. 

The fun this game offers is really dependent on the number and type of people that are playing. If anyone is over analyzing their turns it can grind to a halt.

So I love what this game has to offer and I'm giving it an 8 for now because of how awesome my first game of it was.

I promised myself that in the future I am only going to play this with 5 players so maybe my rating will change after I get more of those games under my belt.

Hang on! An FFG game where the rules aren't a complete mess???
The game is so simple that anyone can get the hang of it after just one turn of play. Draw card to see who you must attack, send ships, ask for allies, play attack card, have resolution. If you win, you may repeat once.
Yet the fifty (50!) Aliens you can choose from make sure that no two games will be the same, since each Alien allow its player to break the rules in one way or the other.
Love the way players interact with (temporary) alliances and negotiations.
Finally tried the Tech cards. Must say they added a surprising amount of fun to an allready great game.

We keep playing this one, and it's alway fun.
Increased the score: 8 --> 9

Not really a board game junkie, but I've played a fair amount of board games and Cosmic Encounter boasts the highest replayability of them all. "A game of infinite possibilities", the statement on the game's box, is spot on. Every game is different than the rest and that's precisely the reason Cosmic Encounter never gets old.

Chaotic fun! Rowdy negotiations, lots of cross-table banter, turns that involve almost every player, relatively short game length: Whats not to love? Well, the free-form relationships and temporary alliances necessary to do well may be difficult for introverts to develop. Cagey, lone wolf players may also be frustrated with the necessity to form alliances to succeed, but I'm really stretching here to find fault with Cosmic Encounter.

One problem with CE is that it plays better the more players you have and my little gaming group has difficulty exceeding 4 attendees. Another is the fact that the base-game only has components for 5 players, when it could easily play 7. Boo! Fantasy Flight for forcing me to buy expansions just so I can have more people play, especially since most earlier versions played 6!

RATING: 5
I enjoyed the idea of this game; Deals, partnerships, back-stabbing, special powers, and different races to play to shake things up.  What seems to happen every game is that everyone quickly gets to 4 planets occupied, than we wait around for someone to draw a good attack card to pull off the win.  Kind of anti-climactic.

Awesome game. So much replayability. Needs to be played with the right group, though. One of the things that keeps it from being a 9+ for me is how unbalanced many of the aliens are. Some aliens are gamebreaking and others are just meh. Another thing that I don't like about the game is the ridiculous range of numbers for attack encounter cards. They range from 0 to 40 for God's sake. Way too large a range. Besides these nitpicks, the game is amazing. If you like Munchkin I especially implore you to get this. Cosmic Encounter is surprisingly similar and way more fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
My favorite game. It's hard to do this game justice in a small comment, but I will try.

There is a great deal of *life* to this game. The components, from the ships to the alien cards are all excellent and really bring out enough theme to make it fun. When we go around and read our alien cards there is usually a lot of nervous looks and awe at the alien being read, and this happens for almost every alien! Even the ones that don't strike fear still are useful enough to keep themselves afloat. There is always a heartbeat with this game, and while not everyone at the table will be pleased every time, it feels like someone is always having a blast playing.

It's a game about strategic alliances and bluffing, but it does it better than any other game I have ever played. I only play the game with pretty basic rules (no flares or tech, but expansion aliens) and I just love how everything is so simple yet so smooth. 

This is my favorite game. Like many have said, this game represents what I think of when I think of why I love board games. There is an unmatched type of player interaction here. Not purely antagonistic and not too cooperative and just enough that one person's bluff could win them a game.

I would like to try the hazard deck from the Cosmic Conflict expansion. Will see if that can shake things up in a good way.

RATING: 10
The evolution of this game is proof positive of the power of the Internet.  Cosmic Encounter has continually changed its mechanics over the course of four decades, both with official expansions and a legion of homebrews, not because anything was broken in the game -- the core game is simple enough to explain to a 6-year-old -- but rather for the sheer fun of experimentation.  The game survived 30 years for a good reason and FFG tapped into the CE community for advice on how to keep the spirit of the game alive in the 2010's.  And they released a thing of beauty.

Improvements?  Oh yeah.  The return of massive numbers of aliens, the most in any CE core set to date.  The benefit of 30 years of CE fanbase experience to tap for ideas such as new races and technology pursuits.  The replacement of an awkward board for a simpler, disc-based system that can allow for shorter games.  The coolest-looking ship tokens to date, straight out of "Plan 9 From Outer Space".  A tighter deck of Attack cards, which makes every ship count in battle.  And for the first time ever, a perfectly laid-out FFG rulebook.   (!)

Like most Ameritrash games, the true game is not in the ruleset.  It's on the table.  This is a game of bluffing, negotiation, and brinksmanship.  Think of it along the same lines as Poker: It's less about hand management and more about opponent management, and if you feel the game is simply too random (which can be a valid criticism) I suggest starting there.

If you've never played Cosmic before, you couldn't have come at a better time.  Look past the soul-crushingly unattractive box cover art and you will be richly rewarded with a classic game that continues to showcase creativity, true player interaction, and fun above all -- a 10 with a laser-gun-fired bullet.

RATING: 7.8
Rarely get to play because you need more than 2 and the right group of people. I love it, but some around me do not like it at all.

Chaotic, funny, crazy. Massive player interaction. Bluffing, negotiating, backstabbing, everything you might want in a social game is found here. 

Main complaint is that its very hard to understand how the game actually works, it's not inherently complicated but the rules are either very poorly written or just are not intuitive. I guess being 30+ years old, it naturally will be a little clunkier. Since I only play a few times a year, I have to relearn/constantly reference how everything really works.

RATING: 7.5
Very entertaining political game. It's practically all politics and so can be very random; I'm not sure if it's possible to be skilled in it. But if played lightly, it's a real blast and produces many memorable moments. It can handle a large(r) number of players as well.

My main gripe is that there are a lot of rules corner cases for some reason. All my plays are half taken up by either forgetting, reminding, or discussing rules. Worst is when a dramatic play is ruined by the fact that it's illegal. For what should be a light and fast game, it's a significant problem; I imagine it should be Shadow Hunters-esque in terms of speed but it really isn't. Perhaps this will go away if I play with a group that's very familiar with it?

Here is a science fiction theme I like: flying saucers! Nothing too serious. I quite like Cosmic Encounter. It is not a deep game, but it is nicely interactive. All players have different alien powers that interact with one another. Even though this is a light game you need to do some thinking. There is also some room for strategies which is good. Whether there is too much luck and randomness in this game I cannot say just yet. [Plays Cosmic Enoucter a few times] Well, now I can: there is definately too much luck and randomness. However, I still quite like this game.

Necessita di un buon numero di giocatori. Salvo ripensamenti futuri, non mi sento di consigliarlo.

I love the different powers. I like the negotiation aspect. I like just about every aspect of the game. This is a game that prides itself on randomness, and every so often that randomness can get it into trouble sometimes (game lasts way too long, a player waltzes to victory with ease, no-win situations). 9/25/2013

Expansions:
Cosmic Alliance
Cosmic Conflict
Cosmic Incursion

Verdict:

What I Like: Replayability is off any known chart. It's statistically certain you'll never play the same game twice. Every alien power dramatically impacts the game. The negotiation driven alliances are the beating heart of this fairly enjoyable experience.

What I Don't Like: Internet FAQs are a must as there is so much extra rule text and rule breaking text that interacts and contradicts among the various powers and cards and expansion stuff. Some of the games can be completely broken by these powers. The worst case is when everyone selects a defensive alien and the game. Drags. On. And. On. Forever. My taste in games over the years has morphed to be more euro bent, and this game sits unashamedly at "very random" on the scale of amerithrash, but I'll gladly still play it from time to time. It's definitely an experience game more than a serious competitive game.

Cosmic Encounter is tons of fun and has more replayability than any other game I have seen. It is also an important addition to my game shelf in that it can be played by up to 8 people at one time (with expansions); a very rare thing for this sort of game.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I was fortunate enough to get 2 more plays of Cosmic in this last year. This has really changed how I feel about this game. I still think it is amazing and great fun, but the group you play with really determines how much fun you're going to have. This game loses a lot of it's charm when it is played with a more serious group of gamers. One of my 2 plays was with a group I normally game with, but the dynamic was a bit off and I felt like everyone was too serious and unfortunately the game fell flat. 

I would love to play Cosmic more, but so far my initial introduction to the game was the best experience I had. Everyone was into the game and everyone role played their race and let their race dictate their play style. I'm looking forward to playing again with a similar group.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9.5):[/COLOR]

[i]- The Grudge: Okay they are one of the many races, but they are the first race I got to play.
Normally I am a pretty laid back guy, but when I play games like this I tend to get really fired up and play aggressively.
The Grudge fed right into this, they allowed me to have a strong negotiation presence whenever I was involved in a conflict.
- Negotiation: The whole game is about negotiation and reading other players, which may be my favorite mechanic in a game.[/i]

Two things I really like about this game, it plays quickly with little downtime between turns (even with 5 players) and the alliances mechanism allows almost every player to participate on almost every turn. Great player interaction in this one.

So we played this for the first time. We have five people. John, Kassie, Ashely, Paula and I. I was the sorcerer race. Which seems like a pretty potent power. You can set people up for automatic failure if you have a negotiate card. Of course only works when attacking, and sadly your alien power is shut off if you lose enough home colonies, which happened to me very quickly. Paula commented that the little UFOs looked like nipples, everyone agreed and started referring to their ships as space nipples. combined with the cone of death this became pretty amusing. We discussed the destiny card mechanic and agreed it was both good and bad since its stops inevitable stalemates by forcing action and further it gives you a bit of diplomatic immunity as you can say your attacks for the most part are out of your hands. I really think the fun of this game is dependent on how the people play it. It can be flat and simple if you just go with the flow or you could spice it up with intrigue. I feel at a disadvantage, because I was like the board game prophet of our gaming group introducing people to board games. I was lucky enough to have played settlers in the early 90s. And Magic the gather and D and D before that. Anyways because of that I am sure to be targeted and destroyed. Unlike other games you can't force your will on people via superior strategy you have to be the most likeable person in the group. Which just so happens to be my wife, plus Kassie is like my wive's twin sister in likability. In short a try hard gamer like me is doomed to lose most times.

This is a great game for those times you have but an hour. ALso, it is a great version of the original game from the late 1970's [I have that one as well]: this is mainly expressed in the various alien-species-cards. Each such card breaks the very simple rules of the game in some way, and the nearly-endless combination of aliens battling and aligning for conquest through their weird powers is both light-hearted, funny, and very tricky at times. 
The only major flaw I find in the game is the fact that some aliens are so powerful that the only way to beat them is for everyone else to gang up on them almost from the start. 
The only minor flaw I find in the game is that it is conceivable for all players but one to win - i.e., there can be one loser and 4 winners, for example.

An excellent game for 2 to eight players with expansions! This game almost feels like a party game with the right crowd. It really is a very simple to play and teach new players. The amazing variety of races to choose from really make this game outstanding! I always look forward to choosing my race from the 2 randomly drawn at the beginning of every game. So far, we have only played with the base rules and all basic races. I look forward to adding in some of the optional cards and advanced races.

In our first couple of games we accidentally missed the rule that you could only add up to 4 ships to any skirmish. We were playing with any number of ships. Basically it led to a faster game, but it was still a lot of fun.

Its a lot of fun with the right people, people that can embrace the wackiness inherent in the game. This game is not balanced on its own, if you are distributing aliens at random, there are some that are objectively more powerful than others. Players need to be able to see this, and work together to reign in the powerful aliens, while also finding inventive ways to leverage their own aliens' abilities.

Ive found it to be polarizing, there are people that I have played with that can't stand it and others, like myself, that could play this game weekly and not get tired of it.

I have Cosmic Incursion and Cosmic Eons expansions, would like Cosmic Dominion.

This game is very different from pretty much everything else I have played.  It is not my usual style of game, but it certainly brings a lot of interesting gameplay to go with the chaos.  I love the components and the idea of the game.  I would really like to play this one more, the rating could end up just about anywhere.  I wish there was a way for the game to move a little faster, and it may since my first experience was with 3/5 new players.

My new favorite drinking game. Played a handful of hands the first night, immediately ran out and bought the first two expansions. It is super cute, generally pretty easy to play, and features some nice little mind-bending logic puzzles. We haven't played it enough that we "know" what the various races do and how they interact.

RATING: 5
I enjoy when playing with real fans, but it's a luck fest. The mechanisms are pretty simple - negotiate like crazy and then big card beats little card (with support modifiers from allies) if you weren't able make a deal. As such the mechanisms, and the board / components for that matter, don't lend themselves to being a great game in themselves. All the fun is in the special powers and being able to do the best with what you get. Having a sucky power is ok if you can use that perceived weakness as a strength in the negotiation aspect (a bit like Diplomacy really).

The fluidity of the negotiations keep any leaders in check, so I guess the strategy is to build yourself into a mid-game position from which to strike for the win. This is really an experience type game, trying to do the best with your powers and seeing what happens and telling the story afterwards. Which is of course quite a different gaming objective from most German / Euro games. If you love deal making, this is a game for you. If you don't, and you just play the cards as you get them, you're in for a luck-fest, one which I'm not a big fan of.

RATING: 6
This game sort of reminds me of Munchkin… Players battle with each other and ask for help from other players and try to aid/hinder each other.  Combat is resolved by secret cards that represent power levels and there are plenty of effects that can determine victory or defeat.  My games have felt like a lot of chaos and then just hoping you can end up at the winners' table at the end.  The many different alien abilities help add variety.  It's one of Tom Vasal's favorite games of all time and I'm not sure why he likes it so much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The more I play this, the more I really enjoy it. To have fun playing this, all players really need to really play up their alien races, which also means that people need to let down their hair a bit. Unlike any game I can think of. Much replayability.

The quality of the cards and components is good.  The design of the game is very teaching/non-gamer friendly, while still maintaining a very appealing style which helps make the game experience enjoyable.

You will treasure the awesome experiences you can and, hopefully, will have playing this game.

I own the 2000 AH edition, but this comment is about this version:

Haven't played this in a couple of years, but I still remember I started to like it, but when one wrong card played in the wrong moment I turned from sure winner to a loser with no chance of influence or counter that at all the game died for me. I'v never liked negotiating games. This is both that and "bash the leader" implemented in a poor way.

I resisted playing Cosmic Encounter for a long time because I thought it was "just a negotiation game". I was wrong. There's nothing I can say in this review that you haven't heard before.

I am a semi-retired magic player so this game satisfies me in so many ways. Phase based turns, cards that break the rules of the games, and variable powers fit the magic side of this game well and I love it! But this game is much different too. Due to alliances and the randomness of the cards you dont have to be the best at cosmic (can you be?) to win and have fun which is a great relief to get people to play with me :-)

I like this game, although not as much as some.  I find that it tends to end too quickly.  Racial special powers can sometimes only be used once before the end of the game.  Negotiating aspect can make this one run long for our group.  Still, sci-fi theme is enjoyable and replay value is limitless given the huge number of different races.

Super fun and chaotic - the alien powers make for a great variety and the basic mechanic is simple and genius. I love that multiple players can win together if they agree to, it changes much of the typical dynamics of a negotiation game. 
In this game, the players really make the game. It's all about figuring them out and making them do what you want - whether you want to win with or without them. Brilliant design - though old and sometimes clanky, it still shines.

A very good chaotic science fiction game. Very lighthearted but still it seems to offer enough control to keep the players interested until the very end.

I like this one a lot, no two games are the same, and even if some combos are a lot stronger than others, the game is short enough that you won't mind if you lost a match.
Another thing to mention is that there's some reading to do in this game, because of all the special powers and special cards, so people that are not used to playing games may find this one a little confusing sometimes.
That said, this is a fantastic product and should be in everyone's collection!

The rules are simple enough, chose a race, then try to take over other players planets in order to get five outside your home galaxy. The special abilities of each race really change the game, but can also be annoying at time. It is quite unbalanced and choosing your race is the only fun part.

RATING: 9
At first glance, Cosmic appears a simple game. Players play a game of War with an added hand management element, while alliances form and splinter. 

However, the 'alien power' gameplay, which allows each player the ability to break the rules of the game in a specific way, allows for near-infinite replayability and dramatically alters how players approach combat, hand management, and diplomacy. Ever time I have sat down to play Cosmic, I've faced off against new and daunting aliens. Almost every alien power can be game changing if understood and played correctly, and alien powers are unique and flavorful. 

Any player who controls five planets belonging to other players wins the game. The dynamic alliance feature allows for multiple players to win the game at the same time (if those players have control of four other planets and win a fifth in an alliance together). This results in exciting shifting blocs and memorable last-ditch efforts to keep powerful alliances from winning the game. 

My only concern is that games are best with 4 or 5 players. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Succeeds where The Resistance fails, which is to say that it has some negotiation, but it isn't pure negotiation and deduction and people can still play and enjoy without worrying about being too involved in the debate and back and forth if they don't want to. The destiny mechanic is an ingenious way of minimizing the king-making, bash the leader, and the inevitable petty vendettas.

After several plays, I absolutely love this game, as does my brother. Everyone else seems unenthusiastic, which is sad.

The game is full of priceless, hilarious, and memorable moments.

< 4 player: Why bother, play something else.
4-6 player: Ideal.
7+ player: A bit much.

Now that I have a buddy who owns this I expect I'll be playing it frequently.  

It reminds me of a multiplayer Blue Moon - it is a simple card game, combined with elaborate special powers and rule breaking situations.  I suspect it would be at its best with five.  I'm not that crazy about special-player-powers games.

RATING: 5
I wasn't really a big fan of this, it seems like game outcomes are 50% luck and 50% the whim of your opponents.  The game seems to really slow down when people get in striking distance of winning; at that point people will start just denying victory to people until they run out of ways of doing so, at which point someone will finally win.  Overpowered flare cards that basically stuck around forever weren't very fun, either.

I'd cite CE as one of the best gateway games. Game has a lot going on theme-wise, aliens are diverse and their artwork has a lot character to it. Stackable spaceship tokens are pure genius.

Rules are easy and well laid out. Cards have a little frame that says who and when can play them, which simplifies things a lot.

All of the above create a framework for fun and diverse negotiation game. It's not the heaviest game around, but everyone in my group is always happy to have it on the table.

RATING: 9
Great game of bluff and negotiation. There are lots of chaos and surprise moments: there are overpowered cards and player powers. Yet it is still somewhat balanced thanks to the negotiation phase of each turn where players can form alliances. You can say whatever you want about your cards and give promises, but you cannot show your cards. There is no downtime as you almost always end up taking part in the battle between two main players. Love the sci-fi theme too, the art is very well done. The game is highly variable and replayable thanks to the 50 available alien races that all bend the rules a lot and interact with each other differently. Best if played few games in a row.

I had high hopes for this game and it disappointed me.  In fairness, my comments are to the introductory game.  

I loved the theme, the interaction, negotiation, variable races and powers, and it had interesting cards.  What I didn't like is its implementation.  I found some cards to be too overpowered.  The problem is that with only 1-4 limit of ships attacking/defending and one encounter card attacking/defending can make your hand or negotiation utterly worthless.  Amassing a decent sized hand of encounters, artifacts, and reinforcements was also of little help, especially someone down on cards with none can get new ones.  There appeared to be little strategic decisions.

Overall, it is a great idea not implemented correctly.

RATING: 7.5
Similar to Wiz-War, this game is very much a product of its era, but unlike Wiz-War, this one works in modern times quite well. The combination of a HUGE variety of alien races that all do unspeakable things to the game and a host of dastardly double-crosses, constantly shifting alliances, and random targets of violence combine to make this an enjoyable blitz of conflict as opposed to Wiz-War's convoluted "anything-goes" cards. I can definitely see my rating of this increasing with further plays.

1 play. Loved it even if I'm not exactly sure why! It's not complex in the sense that there are a lot of rules to digest, it doesn't have tons of clever interlocking mechanisms... but it somehow manages to keep everybody interested and participating in the game. In fact, I think this manages to capture the essence of old fashioned boardgaming: negotiating, backstabbing, special powers, endless rules discussions and a lot of fun! 

I'm looking forward to playing it again!

an exercise in controlled chaos and negotiation. 

People going into this game not expecting conflict or wild swings of fortune are going to be really unhappy. 

It's important that all players understand what they are getting into when playing this game. Otherwise there may be rage quitting and hurt feelings (due to ganging up possibilities). Because of this, you must play this game with the right crowd.

You most certainly can play a better game than others, but it hinges on your negotiation skills, when to use not use your cards and powers, and your alliances. (There is a lot of randomness/chaos.)

For the most part this game is just hilarious fun and you just can't take it too seriously.

If you don't like conflict and broken promises...stay clear of this one.  In concept, a simple game ... simply get your ships onto 5 other player planets.  Yeah...right!  You must make alliances with other players and wheel and deal in order to get ahead in this one.  Each player represents an alien race with its own special abilities.  Colonize another's planet will involve some help.  But be careful, because other players can choose to help the defender for their own rewards.  Wonderful, interactive game only made better by the myriad of expansions out there.

How much you enjoy the game will entirely depend on your gaming group. So much randomness in the game puts off a lot of people.

When we play this, generally what happens is, everyone gets to four bases and then bands together to make sure nobody gets a fifth.  So we keep going around the table until we get bored enough to let someone win.

I avoided Cosmic Encounter for a while because I didn't understand what it was. Once I did my research it was an obvious buy. Cosmic thrives on player interaction which is my favorite aspect of board games.

Just needs players willing to come out of their shell and get into the negotiating as it can be pretty boring if nobody really gets involved.

The randomness you will either love, or it will drive you batshit. But really, if you're bothered by the randomization, you probably shouldn't be playing this game.

Highly recommended by "Shut Up And Sit Down" and thought it would be an awesome piece of my collection.  I also wanted a game with a cool theme that instigated more negotiations.  Unfortunately, this game only works with the right type of players. The type of players that like gambling, negotiating and some backstabbing... My kinda game.  It's a damn shame.

An insane amount of player races and their respective powers make this game an unpredictable and unique game, to be sure.  Each game is very different, and the alliances that form and inevitably come undone are what really makes this game shine.  The direct player interaction keeps this one coming back to the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Negotiations are a huge part of this game. So, you need to ask yourself whether or not you like negotiation games. If so, and if you like monger space games, this might be a game for you. There are so many races and cards, that the game certainly has a high replay value (Another older game that has stood up over time)

RATING: 8
I've found that I don't really like negotiation type games. This game is an exception. The reason is the random attack draws. Plus, alliances are short lived so betrayals don't hurt too bad. Just a very well designed game.

Interesting game with RPG elements, card-playing, and social politicking. There are quite a few smart mechanisms to the game that is constructed so no one player can run away with the game. It's fun and frantic throughout, therefore. Although the one big downside is you'll find yourself referencing the rules frequently to see what counters what and turn order. Still, inventive game for 4-5 players.

There is just something about this game... unfettered by concerns of balance or elegance or any modern game design concepts. They took a simple idea and made it the most fun thing they possibly could. The signature of raw inspiration is embedded in every thread of this game. Everything is hilarious and screwed up and beautiful. I could play it endlessly and never see the same game twice. 

A challenging one because the first time you play it it doesn't make sense. "Huh? Why is this a game? How is this some all time classic?" A game that actually demands you change the way you think about games to enjoy it. Once I stopped trying to play it like a strategy game, and embraced the chaos and scheming and madness, it blossomed like a hyperdimensional flower. But it can put people off if there is not a guide there to reveal the enthusiasm.

A game that is a greater vehicle for pure fun than pretty much any I have ever seen. You make it what it is, but it provides the richness of raw material. The cheshire cat of games, a timeless grin.

I want to like this game and I've played it a ton. However, "We should discuss trading planets" is the most common occurrence in the game. The only thing more common is when everyone jumps on the defense bandwagon to gain benefits. Alien powers play a minimal role, and games usually end in super alliances where 1 or 2 players are left to rot while the rest tag team to victory.

I like this game a lot.  It's a little hard to explain to new players, but after a few turns they usually get the flow.

Received from my Secret Santa 2010. We've played about 5 times and this is a winner. We've only begun to delve into the possibilities and we're all hungry for more.

Excellent stuff...

Strategy plays second to chaos and luck in CE.  I'm glad I have it as it is quick, has bluffing, doesn't hurt feelings and no game is the same.  It's a nice filler.

Truly a great game with the right group.  No two games even remotely the same.  Expansions make it more crazy.  The only complaint I have is that there is too much time spent going around the table asking for allies.  There ought to be a simpler way to go about it that would speed up the game.

Still the best game I have ever played.

Player interaction is second to none
Variety of play with all the expansions is mind blowing (seriously - I tried to calculate the permutations and my mind was blown)

Options are incredible - flares, tech, reward deck, hazards, multiple powers, hidden powers, etc...

I would say that you will NEVER play the same game twice, but in an infinite universe blah blah blah
so, you may play the same game twice but it will be well after those monkeys complete typing Shakespeare

There is a reason this game is still going strong over 40 years after initial release.

I have only played this game once, but it blew me away. I tossed around the idea of buying it for a few months after seeing some review videos of it and wasn't really sure I'd like it. I finally pulled the trigger, and all I can say is that you need to play it to get a real feel for the game. The mechanics are pretty simple, but what makes it great are the layers upon layers of strategy involved. The base game includes 50 alien powers, all of which allow you to break the rules in some way. Figuring out how to play and counterplay these powers is what makes this game awesome. If you choose to play with the techs, it adds yet another layer of options (although you might want to play a few games before using the techs...my group used them on our first play and we pretty much ignored them. It didn't harm the game at all, but the cards just sat there for the whole game).

RATING: 10
I have played (and owned) just about every version of CE since the original Eon. Of the various editions, the Avalon Hill edition had the best art and components but lacked much of what had been available before(they should have released an expansion); the West End was bare bones (and I have saved nothing from it); Mayfair altered the game and added (way) too much crap (but I have saved a ton of the aliens they had offered. Now the FFG edition...they did it right. Everything that a basic CE game needs has been included and I enjoy the new 'Tech' variant. However, I still enjoy the AH components (especially the board/warp) and we continue to use these unless we have 5 players.

CE is a classic game that remains 'alive' even in the new world of Eurogames. Every gamer should own a copy.

Ah Cosmic. I've had some of my best gaming experiences playing it, and some of my worst. 

The basic rules really aren't that complicated. You need to get everyone to understand the structure of a turn (8 or so phases) and which cards they can play when, but the graphics (at least on the FFG edition) really help with this. But the game is really about the exceptions to the rules - your alien power, your cards - and their interactions, and these can quickly become overwhelming for new players, even without including any of the many modular add-ons like flares and technology.

It's also *highly* group dependent. If you play it as a Eurogame, it's no fun and just seems dumb. There needs to be negotiation, backstabbing, outrageous risks, lots of laughter and no hard feelings to make it come alive. It really is a 'game of infinite possibilities' - you'll never play with the same combination of aliens twice, and most of the fun is just sitting back and watching the crazy shit that can happen.

Some peple have talked about the endgame being 'broken'. I don't really agree. Sure, a whole bunch of players can decide to have a joint victory, but more often people will try to save up cards for a final push on their own, or someone will win in a crazy unexpected way.

It's one of the most divisive games I know. Several friends who generally share my tastes absolutely hate it, and I've not yet quite figured out how to predict who will and won't enjoy it. But if you can find a group of four or five (or more with the expansions) who really get it, it's an outrageous amount of fun.

A decent game which is primarily interesting because of the player decisions and behaviors it incites. The player races are radically asymmetric and often imbalanced, and the players respond accordingly.

Simple space combat game about destroying and colonizing your opponents planets, however each player becomes one of 50 unique alien races that drastically breaks the rules of the game. A certain race multiplies their attack power by the number of ships they have, one race automatically wins the game after a certain amount of time, one race reverses the numbers on every card. It may seem unbalanced but people who have more powerful races tend to be ganged up on.

9.5 - Just wow.  I picked this game up a few days ago and already have half a dozen games under my belt.  It's amazing that a game can be so light and deep at the same time, the varied alien powers make each game different enough that even playing with the same group you'll wind up with different alliances because of powers.  I'm already thinking about which expansion to toss in next but I don't need them yet so I want to play more with the core.  Don't hurt me but it's all the cool stuff that munchkin starts with but none of the petty bullshit that muchkin breeds.

Cosmic Encounter is one of the best boardgame ever for me. I consider this new FFG version not only as a simple reprint, but the perfect mix of the best parts of all the old versions of the game, with nice components.

I found the new (optional) Technology cards as a great improvement, with a simple but clever mechanic.

But there's no sense crying

And you make a neat game.

I only have one play of this, and it was with some non-gamers, and it tanked. I like everything about it though, and fully expect to enjoy it once I get a chance to play it with people who like this sort of stuff.

UPDATE: After playing with some gamers, they loved it. The fact that everyone gets a unique power and adopts a type of personality for the game makes it feel like an actual Alien conflict, which makes the game shine.

Tentative rating: 8/10 based on the games I've played. It could go up with the right group. My group loves multiplayer Magic though, which directly competes for sessions with Cosmic Encounter, so I might not get to play it much for a while.

UPDATE: I played this with a group of laid-back gamers and it rocked. Everyone got into it and had a great time. This game is brilliant in so many ways.

RATING: 7
There is something "cool" about this game I cannot really grasp. Good components and "ships" look nice. At it's heart, it's really a negotiation game, so if you don't like it, it's not for you - it's less likely for one player to win "alone" just by game mechanic. 

Also, given the amount of rules on player's cards, it feels like it's terribly unbalanced. This might be a nice game for a filler, but serious gamers will be probably put off by some insane combos certain characters can pull of. It looks like most chars gets this really really good superpower, and it's race towards the end. The scoring is also a bit flawed and the game either ends with 3 players winning the game, or drags horribly, because everyone else is trying to deny that last point to the winning group/player. 

I would play again, but not going to buy it. Too many design decisions that annoy me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I know that the game is supposed to be centered around politicking and negotiation, but sometimes the game state is so horrendously unbalanced between two players based on their alien powers that it just feels unfair. When the option to stop a runaway lead is to gang up on someone, and you also can't influence which player you'll have an encounter with, it's tough to have a proactive effect on the game state. You can only play so many negotiate cards while waiting for the leader's turn to come around.

Also, Flare cards are stupidly good since you don't discard them after playing them. It adds too much variance for my tastes, because That Guy who draws all of the Flare cards usually just wins.

RATING: 5.25
My My, how expectations can be wrong, at least so it appears. This has been on my must-have list for quiet some time, despite the fact that I never played it. Now, I had the pleasure of trying it for the first time and was royally flabbergasted by it. It is a very simple game, which is not a bad thing, but it is so random and yet at the same time limited in its possible strategic decisions that I never really experienced the sensation of playing a 'game' in the true sense of the word but experiencing a cascade of random events unfolding before my eyes. The destiny cards are the first thing that I found bizarre, if you cannot choose who to attack, the winner of the game can solely be determined by card draw. Yes, yes, you might form alliances, but who would ally with you unless necessary anyway and then, where is the strategical decision ? Same goes for defending. The abilities are a good idea, but I found that too far in the game-breaker instead of tactic enhancer field. All in all, I am still astonished by the mediocrity of this game and will most definitely have to play it again and make sure whether it was just a one-off bad experience.

Entirely dependent on the interactions and social nature of the group you play with. If the group is right for the game, this is as much fun as you'll ever have. If it is a new group that doesn't know how to to "roll play" enough to pit themselves against one another, then, this game will be an utter disaster.

No two games are the same, multiple people can win, very little downtime, lots of laughs, alliances of convenience that can change from turn to turn.

While I wouldn't classify it as a gateway game, it's certainly accessible to many people.

Cosmic is a brilliant mixed up mess of chaos.  Sometimes it sparkles with the brilliance of a galaxy of suns.  Sometimes it wimpers.  And either way, it's all your fault.

Cosmic is a bare bones game design.  Thematically players embody alien races trying to colonize foreign planetary systems (you know, the ones controlled by their opponents).  But all the manouver of a multiplayer confilict game has been removed.  Players don't get to choose who they attack.  Instead a player draws a destiny card and the card tells the player who he has to "encounter".  Then the attacker loads up the "hyper space cone" and attempts to finagle some real estate out of his opponent.  The attacker and the defender play cards in a blind bidding fashion.  The card values add to the number of ships committed to battle.  Highest value wins.  If the offence wins he gets to clear out all the locals and move in.

It's all pretty simple, but there are a couple things that really make it crazy.  First, the combatants can request help from the other players.  Second, and this is the game's trademark mechanism, all the alien races have their own unique (and seemingly unbalanced) powers.  The simple game mechanisms get warped and wobbled.  Furthermore one player can win or all but one player can win.

The strength and the weakness of Cosmic Encounter is that you, my dear player, can make it go any way you want.  A more systemic flaw is that players tend to gang up on the leader.

With three plays I feel I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of this bloated beast of a game, but man has it been great thus far. 

A rather basic core game is raised to terrific heights by adding numerous variables, lots of player interaction and providing many occasions for laughing out loud. 
Long term strategic planning, which I tend to really like in a game is completely off the table in this organised excuse for chaos, but it is something I will gladly do without if it means I can have fun to such a degree. The art style is not really to my taste as it leaves little to nothing to the imagination. 

Still I would be surprised if it doesn't retain a perfect 9 score for me.

The Dutch version of "Cosmic is a direct copy of the Fantasy Flight version with similar components and a downright embarassing translation. Seriously, it looks like a first draft that no one bothered to proof-read before shipping the lot to the printers. Overly long sentences with typos galore. Ït is a big game with tons of text but come on, really?

The game is fantastic as ever and the publisher needed to get at least one thing completely right: To deliver a good translation in order to expand the potential user base and help get it to more tables. That didn't happen and I wager good money that we won't be seeing a second print run to correct the plethora of mistakes, unfortunately.
In its current state it is hard to recommend it over the English version in any way, unless Dutch really is the only language you or people you'll be playing this with can understand.

I've never won, but I have come close. This game really is not nearly as good as I thought it would be (Tom Vasel marketing is too good), as I felt like a lot of the mechanics were severely outdated and the combat system stale. The aliens just seemed so out of place and tacked on, and I felt like a lot of my actions did not really affect the game that much. Highly considering trading/selling. All of my friends either love it or chuckle at its ridiculous mechanics. No one, plus me, hate it though. Still very disappointed.

The game on it's own merit isn't very exciting.  it's basically War the card game.  BUT!  It's the interaction between players that makes this game one of a kind.  It definitely is NOT balanced.  You have alien powers that are just horrible and some WAY overpowered...but you have to work together and even share a victory to do your best to win. I love games where there is a game inside of a game.   This is one of the best.  It is at the bottom of my top 10 only because it is so hard to find the number and RIGHT group for me to play it

Pros:
1. Classic - This game is a classic.......

Cons:
1. Long - This game takes way too long to play.
2. Imbalanced - The alien powers are all over the place. Some are extremely powerful, some are useless.
3. Negation Based - Games that incorporate negotiation usually have the same issue. They rely on the players to balance the game. Generally, I find this to be lazy game design. 
4. Games end in a tie - Almost every game ends in a tie or if you're in to double speak "Multiple Winners".

Summary: Some people love this game, but it's clearly not for me.

RATING: 10
While there are elements from the EON expansions that I miss in this edition, it's by far my favorite of the ones I've seen or played, including the Eon version. Superb art, terrific encounter phase timeline on every alien power, great rules and definitions clarifications, and I really like the new planets & ships (though I do miss the hexes... just for nostalgia's sake).

My only gripe as a long-time fan of the Eon edition, and an owner of a much-played Mayfair edition, is that they used the re-named game elements from the most recent reprint.  Edicts are now Artifacts, the Hyperspace Cone is now the Hyperspace Gate, Challenges are now Encounters... that last one make the most sense considering the name of the game.  It's just got to be confusing to new players as I explain the game, "... at the beginning of each Challenge, I mean Encounter..." "all their tokens go to the warp... I mean ships go to the warp."

I am finding that I love games where there is a large degree of replayability due to character selection. With the large number of alien races, the different powers they possess, and the way each one interacts with one another, this game is different every time.

Cosmic Encounter is an often hilarious game of making and breaking alliances, often in the same breath.  
Utterly random, unbalanced and chaotic... but... for once that's just fine.  Cosmic is far more interested in inspiring crazy hijinks and player narratives than it is in arbitrary concepts like "fairness" or "long-term strategy". 

I have yet to walk away from a night where this hit the table without a grin and a story to tell.

Side note:  With expansions, you can include up to 8 players.  This is a TERRIBLE idea.  4-5 players is what you want.  6 with some patience.

There's no denying the place that this early American hobby game occupies in the cannon of tabletop games. That said, the game's design shows its age.  It is pretty chaotic and can be overly long when played with anyone who does not understand this isn't a strategically deep game, and in turn constantly over-thinks their turn. That said, like a lot of these diplomacy type games, this one is very group dependent. So with the right group this does have the potential to be a lot of fun and should play pretty quickly, which is rare enough for this type of game that if one were a fan of take this style games, you could do worse than this one.

I was a little disapointed in this one. I've heard so much about this over the years I think I may have been expecting a little more out of it.  Seems to be very dependent on having an interesting mix of alien powers as some of my plays have been very lively and some of just felt flat. Really wanted to love this, but as it is I have to say I could take it or leave it. I do plan to give it a few more plays to be sure. If it changes my mind the rating will go up some, if not I'll probably rate it lower and work more aggressively to trade it for something more my liking.

You know, I actually do not hate the game. It's just that every time I play this, it is decided by rather random factors. The key to this game and rather all diplomatic games is on the players. Once you see people growing spiteful with one another, or give favorable sympathy, it really turns into a different game. I hate that. Winning the game becomes about "ganging up" rather than through clever play. I would rather have a game where people act in their best interests to win logically than be at the whim of emotions. Games that throw the balance on diplomacy, risks throwing the balance on illogical players. So the game can be fun, but most of the time it will be ruined by illogical players deciding the game. I'm here to win.

I've played this game at least half a dozen times. Every time it ends the same- half of the table gets tired of the back-and-forth nature of the victory points and 3 or 4 players team up for a tie game.
There are some decent mechanics in this game, and some of the alien powers are just great, but I'm convinced something is missing from making this game work.
No matter what aliens are chosen. No matter what cards are drawn. Cosmic Encounter just doesn't end until everyone gives in.
So, overall, yes, I love the theme. I love that it supports up to 8 players and the basic idea is very entertaining. It's just too much of a fiddly mess to support itself.

This is a game I probably need to play again to truly form an opinion about it.  There were several aspects of the game that were off putting to me.  First, I felt completely out of control about what happened to me.  Destiny cards and the ally nature of the game made it seem very swingy.

The attack cards are so widely distributed.  I played a 10 early, which seemed good but got destroyed by a 30 or something.  So wildly swingy!

I guess I'm just not a fan of ameritrash games.  I would never ask to play this game and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Having said all that, I can understand how others might enjoy it.  If you like a lot of confrontation, negotiation and want the game balance to be driven by the people in the game - go for this.  If you like to be the agent of your own destiny - pass.

RATING: 6
Often a fun and slightly outrageous game. It has simple core mechanisms and yet, creatively, it's had everything thrown into it. It has deception, randomness, negotiation etc in spades. It's bordering on being a party game.

However you probably won't like this game at all if you:
- Dislike the massive amount of randomness, both from the cards and the players.
- Dislike the massive amount of 'metagame', for example where players will gang up on you just because is SEEMED to them that your particular alien character was overpowered in a previous game.
- Dislike the MASSIVE catch-up mechanism, whereby you exclude players who are doing well from making progress towards the finishing line (while helping players who are behind, in return for them helping you succeed in fights). Seriously, the game often concludes with all players being almost at the finishing line together and then one player edging a victory just because of a lucky card they drew.

Depending on how much the above problems worry you, this game could either gert old very fast of genuinely feel incredibly fresh and new each time you play it.

The world's number one boardgame youtuber Tom Vasel still says this is his favourite game (as of 2016). But he likes silly games. By comparison, my gaming group has never requested that Cosmic Encounter comes back to the table. I also had a quite flat game of it in a different, lively gaming group in London a few years ago.

Interestingly, Tom Vasel's own game that he published, called Nothing Personal, fell into exactly the same trap of having such huge catch-up mechanisms that the first two-thirds of the game are irrelevant infighting.

I'm wondering if I should have rated this a 7 instead, but honestly I'm simply not usually in the mood to play it.

huge amount of variability with the alien power.  It's what drives this game which is relative easy play but takes some good strategy to play well.  Playing with the tech deck and hidden power variants put this game at its best.  I do really enjoy this game but you have to the right players to play.  If played to seriously then it can really harbor bad feelings and thus a bad game experience also you really need 4 players at a minimum which for me happens on rare occasions.

While there is a huge variety of Alien races, some are just completely overpowered and render other races "useless" against them. 

The whole of my single play of this was just a collection of players piling on whoever was the unluckily drawn defender. Little to no strategy to be seen really. Overall, not a game I really enjoyed.

Cosmic Encounter is a game full of interesting twists that skins what would otherwise be a potentially repetitive experience.

It's a great social/interactive offering, although one that does not quite boost enough tension for my taste, at times, and overall it is quite light-hearted, say compared to Diplomacy.

This is both a good thing and a bad thing... at least I don't think I'll ever come away from the table with fewer friends than I started the game night with.

this game is just fun... I guess people think there should be some sort of strategy but it falls apart if they look for one that can get a high % of wins. the only strategy is to look like you won't win.

RATING: 4
Asymmetrical powers always interest me but never fail to leave me with the impression that some powers are much better than others. Obviously, the dozens of powers available in this game couldn't have all been rigorously tested against one another for balance.

The game loses points because it's important to me in a game that equally skilled players have an equal chance of winning.

*It occurs to me that savvy players should weigh the strengths and merits of the aliens in play so as not to ally too frequently with overpowered races. This might counter-balance the powers of those races.*

Great game if you get the right people with the right powers. Endlessly replayable and customizable, which can create some really incredible and memorable situations, but also can ruin the game for you if certain things don't go your way. Fun more often than not, though.

A very silly game, with really interesting player powers. The games design can lead to rather dull and uninteresting game play, but there have been some very exciting and fun moments. In my play group, the mind set is to always ask everyone to attack and everyone to defend. It can be quite boring, since that makes is so easy for two people to ally and win. If they would play with more of an interest in winning with no allies.

After playing this game several times, I've come to the conclusion that I can't understand why this would be anyone's favorite game.  It seems very average to me.  The one neat thing is the abundance of alien race cards in the game, but unique player powers seems very standard these days.  I've played one fun session of the game with "the right group of people", but that doesn't push me to elation or even high-satisfaction.

The FFG version is prettier, but I don't know if there were any great improvements.  I was disappointed that the Flares played a MUCH bigger part in the game than the player powers themselves and had an icky tendency to accumulate in one player's hand.

EDIT: I would like to play either without the flares or with some variant where they're discarded.  Still, I find myself wanting to play a little more, so I upped my rating a bit.

Considered by many people (myself included) as the great masterpiece of board games, this is a very peculiar one, no doubt. I see it as other special games, such as "Tales of the Arabian Nights" or "Dungeon Quest", meaning that every time you start a game you don´t know what´s going to happen. It´s an unknown adventure! As a player, we  will not have control of the situation of the game. And I love that chaos!! This game is pure fun, and in all the games that we´ve played, we´ve enjoyed a lot. And it doesn´t matter who is the winner! A truly masterful classic. But hey! Not for all tastes, of course! Played with the correct people, is a blast!

A classic that I would personally describe as a "strategic beer and pretzels game."  Use your little space ships to take over opponents' planets while trying to protect your own.  Add cards that momentarily break the rules completely out of left field.  As a result, there's a tremendous amount of luck, but also a tremendous amount of laughs.

There is such a "go after the leader" ability that I'm always afraid it will devolve into an unending stalemate, but someone somebody ultimately gets that last point.

The new edition has gorgeous and well-done components that are very self-explanatory.  Unlike some devotees, I'm afraid I would get burned out on this after more than an occasional play.

Very fun game.  The player interaction generated by the different alien powers is worth the price of admission alone.

I've played Cosmic Encounter countless times since 1978. In one sense no two games have ever been alike because there are so many alien powers to choose from but, regardless of your power, the game is all about manipulating your friends into making deals that are not in their best interest while they try to do the same to you. I would categorize this as a party game.

Cosmic encounter is in my opinion at best a so-so game. In this game you play an alien race or possibly two who are trying to take over at least 5 planets that are owned by other players. This is done by essentially playing a version ofthe original card game war with special abilities on some cards. You can also ask other players to add their cards in to help you.

Pros: fun negotiation at times, extremely interactive, fast and easy setup, game can play up to 6 players.

Cons:games are variable long, usually erring on the short side, the game can end without some players even gaining traction,not strategic, all based in peoples ability to manipulate others,  no one winner so all but one can win in some cases.

THE standout game of the 1970s/1980s, it still deserves its very high rating. The recent re-implementation series is even better.  ALWAYS in our top 10 game choices. EVERYBODY we know who plays it, likes it. There is almost no down time, because every player can almost always somehow be involved in proceedings. The only problem which keeps CE from being played more by us is the highly variable and unpredictable game length, which means we have to allow sufficient time for a long game. (My guess is that our average is about 45 mins, but has gone as long a about 2.5 hours in one unusually long game.)
Funnily enough, it is also possibly the best socially interactive game that we play, aside perhaps from Pandemic. Which reminds me of another plus - you can have multiple winners in this game.

Here's how I teach Cosmic Encounter, including suggested power selection:

Do a sample turn. Start with the simplest elements, and add complexity. Deal each player a standard hand and powers. Tell players to ignore Edicts, Reinforcements, Flares, Powers, etc. for now.

Flip the Destiny deck and go through a challenge, including allies. Then go through the following sample combats:

a. Each player plays an Attack card.

b. Each player plays a Negotiate card and attempt to make a deal. Mention that "base for a base" is a very good deal, as well as trading cards.

c. One player plays an Attack, the other a Negotiate. Explain Compensation. Mention that Compensation is a very good way to obtain Flares, which are reusable, and covered later.

d. Explain how Reinforcements work, as well as Edicts. Then redo the challenge, allowing everyone to play Reinforcements and Edicts.

e. Explain timing. By now, players should have a rough idea how the phases would work. Then introduce Flares and Powers. Redo the challenge, with all the game components.

I should mention that, with powers, I prefer to deal each player two green powers face-down. At any time, a player may use his power by revealing it at the appropriate time. I find that one-power games can be incredibly dull, since some players may use their power rarely in the game (especially those which occur only when the player wins as a main player). Revealing powers allows players to introduce new rules (and that's what the powers are -- new rules players have to understand) to the game at *their* pace. Dealing each player a power face-up requires new players not only to digest the base game rules, but also *every* player's power. 

***

In no particular order...

* One way to get past "power overload" is to play hidden powers. You are dealt your power and keep it face down until you decide to use it. This allows new players time to digest the basic rules of the game before powers come into play. (Personally, I recommend each player receives *two* hidden powers, so that players get to play with their powers more often during the game!) Likewise, you can shuffle the Flares (and maybe Edicts) into the deck *after* initial hands are dealt.

* As for the science fiction theme, it's about on the level of Race for the Galaxy. Myself, I think the science fiction theme works fine.

* Regarding diplomacy and negotiation, I think anyone who's played games involving simple negotation (even Steve Jackson "take that" Games, where players end up taking down whoever's leading) will easily understand the negotiation necessary for Cosmic Encounter. Remember that, when making a deal, the "base for a base" agreement is one of *the* best moves to make early and mid-game, since you each now have gained one more base than the players not in the deal.

* A tip to avoid bad hands: In Cosmic Encounter, having a hand of many cards is rarely a disadvantage. So, if you have a poor hand, make a deal with your opponent that includes giving away *all* your cards. This will allow you to draw a new hand which hopefully is better. Alternately, ally defensively and draw cards so you don't end up in this situation. With flares, I actually find I rarely have a bad hand, since, even though I may lose a challenge, at least I can use a flare to my advantage.

***

I pretty much *like* the "do not reveal until played" variant, but, with n00bs, it's "deal two and keep them secret until revealed". I also suggest shuffling in the flares *after* dealing the initial hand.

* N00bs have enough to learn from the game besides the powers. Requiring them to digest the power *before* the rules is equivalent to learning the advanced rules of the game before playing the basic one.

* Some powers are outright boring when played alone (eg. "Usable only as an attacking player"). Even a "when a main player" powers might not be used more than a few times in a game (eg. Clone player with no advantageous Attack cards).

* Vets get to play an advanced game of CE, rather than the less fun "one power each" version. Let's get off the baby food and have something more substantial!

* Even when playing the standard game, n00bs miss out how their powers work. The game is *very* forgiving it a player mis-plays their power, since it's the player interaction, not the powers, which are the most important part of the game.

* Not revealing your power at the right time can confuse veteran opponents. If you accidentally discard your Attack 30, your opponent will conclude you're not the Clone. Then, when you draw an Attack 20, you use it twice to gain your last bases.

* The key part of the game is knowing when to invite allies. This strategy, not the powers, is how you win the game.

*****

Some random hand manipulation suggestions...

* If you have a crappy hand, play a Negotiate against someone who (you guess) has a good hand. If you take Consolation, hope to get some good cards. If you make a deal *offer to give away ALL your cards*. You get a new hand of (hopefully) better cards, and your opponent gets more cards to "protect" his good cards from Consolation.

* Ally with the defense, especially if the expansion set Rewards deck is in play. In the short term, it can be painful, especially if the other (n00bs) do nothing but ally with the offense. If more than one person catches onto this strategy, one of them will win the game.

* Ally with the offense! If the other players don't catch on that allying is better than being the offensive player, that's they're problem! (N00bs!N000000bs!) If you can win the game without needing to play cards from your hand, you've just won the game!

* Bluff. This trick only works once. Play like you have a really good card in your hand. I can never pull this off.

* Die a painful death. Sputter, play a weak Attack card, and essentially do nothing during your turn. Lose planets. In practice, however, most players don't lose their powers. In a one-power game, you don't even *use* your power all that often, so losing your power is overrated -- especially if players keep inviting others when they're the offensive player!

* Play with flares. The more you play a flare, the more others will want it. Even if the flare isn't all THAT good. I've noticed that one flare can make a crappy hand into a useful one. Once you get a good flare, do your best to get more cards to prevent losing it from Consolation. Alternately, make it more likely that your opponent will get the flare with Consolation, so you can draw a new hand -- which hopefully will have another flare.

I played this only once, at a board game cafe, but something went wrong.  I can't quite place what it was; there was a mood of uncertainty at the table, and I remember having the idea that we might be playing incorrectly.  Whatever it was, it resulted in nobody at the table seeming to be really invested in the game, and I suspect that this is a game which can fall flat if players are not playing with enthusiasm and a real desire to win.

Now, years later, I am increasingly eager to play the game again.  I've been thinking about it, and reading about it, and at this point I am ready to purchase the game without needing to play it again first, despite that lukewarm-at-best first experience.  I love the idea of the huge number of variable powers, the engagement that arises when everything is driven by player interaction, and I feel that this is a game which can pack a great experience into a fairly short time.

Dropping from 9 to 8 after third play.. we had a pretty horrible 5-player 4-hour drag with it yesterday. Might be a really bad combination of aliens/special powers, but the game just went around and around and around. Many of the powers seemed to work towards holding other players back rather than progressing towards winning youreself. Aliens in play:
- Spiff
- Vacuum
- Will
- Observer
- Oracle
Other flares in play:
- Macron
- Warrior
- Trader
- Parasite
??
This really seemed to be a bad combination.. or maybe it was this group's playstyle in some way.

If you give CE a fighting chance, you might see that there's a good degree of skill involved in cajoling and backstabbing your way to the top. Underneath all the crazy powers and card interactions, CE is an asymmetric negotiation game that rewards skillful resource management and clever tabletalk.

There's a good deal of luck present, but I don't think an unhealthy amount given the light-hearted nature of the game.

That all being said, CE will falter in a group that doesn't buy into it. It's not a game for everyone, and it can potentially drag into tedium due to the hugely varied play times.

Personally, I hate it, and feel it’s a very dated design. You have too little agency and too little information, with the random encounter locations, blind bids of randomly drawn cards, tedious open-ended negotiations, and wildly unbalanced special abilities.  The special abilities are the most interesting part of the game, but unless you’re playing with a variant, you just randomly get one at the start of the game and that’s it; they’re an interesting feature bolted on top of a rotten framework.

Honestly, that’s what makes it so frustrating, that there is a kernel of an awesome idea in this heartbreaker, and then everything around it is terrible. I do thank it for giving us its cousin Dune, with more empowering mechanics and well-tuned set of powerful special abilities, and for inspiring both Magic the Gathering and the modern school of asymmetric-faction dudes-on-a-map games at which Eric Lang excels, but I have no desire to play their dusty ancestor.

Everything I loved from my childhood in a game like Risk...arguing over who should attack or ally with other players.  The alien powers and flares make for a humorous time of yelling at each other.

This is definitely more about the meta game than actual bluffing in my book and I prefer my negotiation games that way.

RATING: 8.5
Entertaining way to spend some time, but definately a four or five player game (though there is a passable 2-player variant which our FLGS owner showed us). 

It's probably best seen as a type of 'poker'. You may not win every hand, but with clever bluffs, misdirection, and table-talk you can up your win-rate a lot. I think this game's got a lot more depth than most people think - with the limited amount of knowledge held by the players, and some clever deductions, this can become a very intense game.

Worth owning due to the fact that it's a real classic, for the 50s/60s 'Sci-Fi'ness. The game itself is just a bonus.

Visual Appeal: (5)
Everything looks great. The art on each alien card is unique and really adds a good flavor. Plastic spaceships are brilliant rather than some drab tokens.

Component Quality: (5)
The spaceships are a good size and stack-able! Cards are a nice durable finish and the larger alien race cards allow them to be read at a distance on the table. If I could find one ease-of-use gripe it would be that the colony counter is easily jostled around on a busy table. A slider or dial would have been neater.

Theme: (4)
This is essentially a negotiation game in space. Alien powers and technology cards affect different parts of the game often allowing you to break rules. I imagine that humans meeting real aliens in a game of interstellar thermonuclear war would also yield cries of, "you can do what? Aw, no fair!" Followed by us humans gambling our way to victory Kobayashi Maru-style.

Learning: (4)
I learned from another player first and didn't read the rule book until my 3rd play or so. The game is fairly easy to teach and there are some modular rules (like tech cards or yellow/red aliens) that can be removed to reduce complexity. The rule book is clear enough and gives scenario examples. Learning the odds of certain cards coming up in the deck takes experience.

Gameplay: (3)
It is more a result of the players than the game, but the game definitely encourages dastardly dealings. I like the fact that the game can have some swing to it. Everyone has different abilities and it behooves you to learn who you can team up with (or against) to increase your odds of coming out on top. The biggest thing I don't like is how certain aliens or actions will paint a target on your head and make it very difficult to succeed.

Overall Fun: (4)
With the right group this game can be a blast. Some people I've played with had a problem with the randomness, but I feel that it is a very human element of the game. With enough charm and guile, you can talk people into doing things that benefit you.

First time, I won as Trader! Easy rules, lots of interaction, lots of replayability due to various races, cards, and number of players.

I've played a few more times now--and revere this game even more due its age. What a pathbreaker! It can lag at times, and sometimes things get a bit sticky with various powers cluttering the field and sequence of play a bit, but all in all, one for the ages, as its history has shown.

I still don't like flares much, but for ease and time of play, this one packs a humorous, vindictive, interactive, and diplomatic punch. Like life, often annoying, but it does lead to a lot of laughing it up.

Currently, Cosmic Enounter is one ofmy favorite group games. This is a very unbalanced game, and you know that going in.  For that reason, it creates some of the best interactions, and chaos you can see in a game today.  The goal is simple: You are an alien race who is trying to colonize on 5 planets that are not yours.  Every alien also has a powerful abillity which will aid them on there adventure.  With crazy cards, powers, alliances, betrayal you are sure to have a unique game everytime.

A tremendously fun game that's fast paced and very easy to learn with almost no downtime; the individual players are often involved during other players' turns, plus your turn tends to come back around pretty quickly.  Two thumbs up!

UPDATE: 

Usually I integrate additions to my comments into the main body of the text, but with Cosmic I'm going to make an exception to show how my thoughts on this game have evolved.  The top paragraph was written when I hadn't even had Cosmic for a month and was rating it at an 8.5.  Pretty solid rating, huh?  Not high enough.  With over 40 plays racked up in under a year, I can definitively say that I never get tired of this game - with fifty different aliens to play, every single game is a fresh and unique experience.  SO AWESOME.  I won't play with fewer than four players anymore (I have other games that work better for three), but with four or five, I'm always happy to see it hit the table.  I love dazzling new players with how amazing it is!  Can't wait for the first expansion to come out as I'm looking forward to six player Cosmic...

RATING: 8
Cosmic Encounter is a gaudy space-themed negotiation-style game that grows on you. It has a fairly basic set of game mechanics which on their own are not particularly exciting. Basically, draw a card that tells you to attack another player; attack or negotiate with that player; occupy that player's colony or be rebuffed--rinse and repeat. The ultimate goal of the game is to occupy five opposing players' colonies before they do.

The heart of this game is 1) variable race powers an 2) negotiation. There are 50 completely different powers, some possibly game-breaking and others of a more ordinary nature. They add an extra flavour to the game. The Loser power turns a defeat into a win, the Vaccuum drags opposing ships down with it when defeated, the Warrior gets stronger with each battle, the Observer protects allied ships from dying in case of a defeat. Each power has its benefits and calls for a different playing style.

The most important part of Cosmic Encounter is the negotiation. Players will need to call allies and will also need to know when it is better not to. They will need to form alliances that are trusting, yet temporary. Most games that I have played end up with many players on the verge of victory, with only the one player who was struggling at the start to come from behind and win as everyone was too busy stopping each other from taking the last colony.

Cosmic Encounter may seem gaudy, a little oddly-themed with mechanics that might seem odd and outdated, but the actual metagame is what makes it infinitely replayable.

Cosmic Encounters is quirky fun.  You can't take this game seriously.  There are big swings to it, and you never know who might support or NOT support you in a battle.

RATING: 8
First time I played, I didn't like it. It wasn't fun, felt outdated, and I felt generally meh about it...

However, I feel like I was in a very "Euro" mode when I gave it the initial shot.  Once you embrace the chaos (Like you do for RoboRally) then you are going to have a blast. Realize that negotiation and bluffing and trash-talking is a part about it.

Great fun. Love the different powers, and this game is the KING of variable player powers.

But, I have to admit, I still expect something more out of this game.  I suppose I expected it to be a 9 or 10 in my book, but its just not quite there. It certainly feels a little dated.  

Also, the game really depends on the players. If they get into the game, then it will be fun. However, if the players have to make the game fun, is the game itself really that good? I don't know.  Either way, I do enjoy the game. I was expecting to be blown away, and I wasn't, but it's still very enjoyable.

UPDATE: This game leaves me a bit disappointed. I suppose I'm just asking too much of this game - I keep expect it to be one of the best games ever.

UPDATE: Everything just clicked for me.  It took like 4-5 plays (embarrassing, I know) but all the sudden I completely got the game.  I knew the chaos, but not the negotiation just game up to match.  It could have been that we played it right after a game of The Resistance, which really set us in the right mood.

As the board game that began my obsession with the hobby, Cosmic will always hold a very special place in my heart. The alien power interactions and timing rules can get confusing, and, even as a veteran player, I find myself looking up a rule on BGG about every other game. Cosmic is probably not the best game out there in the political genre, but I have too many fond memories of epic Cosmic moments not to have a high opinion of this game.

Astounding that an elegant forward-thinking design like this came out in the 70s. The simple system is set up nicely for negotiating and backstabbing, then gets out of the way for the alien powers and cards to take over and tear it down.

I don't like negotiation much, and the theme doesn't grab me, but it's interesting to see the interplay of cards/abilities and the frantic cooperation of players to bash the leader and try to balance the game. No two games ever play the same, despite how much you think you know the cards, and I like to see how hilariously broken the game can get each time. Doing broken things and inviting others to use their broken things on you trumps winning sometimes.

[-]Once-in-a-while/month game though, I feel pretty satiated after each play.[/-] Understand the game more now, and each play varies so differently from the next that there's no point not to repeat-play. Very strong contender for the 60-to-150-minute range 4/5/6/7er game.

[hr]

Perfectly tuned for large groups: Random encounters and alliances keep everybody engaged at all times (and solves the > 4-player interaction by adjacency problem)), while shared wins and random encounters take kingmaking out of your hands.

On the attraction side, alien powers and flares and their combinations introduce a huge variety in each game and always provide something new to think of. Need to adapt and think on your feet, which is also necessitated by the randomness and constant change.

Still forward-thinking by today's standards and more like a gift from the future than a relic from the past. Example: random encounters sound totally taboo ("it's totally random who I attack??"), but it solves large-player-count issues by deftly near-eliminating kingmaking and removing the constraints of adjacency, and just means you need a plan for [I]everybody[/I], not just wounded Joe. Another example: the totally unique concept of a shared victory sounds like kissing your sister, but really, it speeds up the endgame (and hence mitigates leader-bashing and kingmaking) by allowing you to continue pursuing winning solutions that coincide with those of others; I deem it [i]socially irresponsible[/i] to delay a likely shared victory to pursue your solo win!

(I can be socially irresponsible sometimes though.)

Cosmic Encounter (Fantasy Flight Games 2008 edition) -- We have yet to play with CE fans, but this edition warrants a high rating.  Not simply for such high quality components, but for such thoughtful design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
My signature game from the time when people still played games for the sake of playing them. CE is utterly chaotic, which means you just take your surfboard, ride the waves and hope it all kinda works out. It also means you can get away by stupid things. CE is about negotiations, but the brilliant thing is that the game tells you who to attack, so no alliance lasts more than one turn - which means a lot of social groupthink is neutralised. CE also allows bluffing (with negotiation cards). And last but not least - when you sum it all up, CE is primarily about having a fun ride, 

It's the funky game. 

I also have the Cosmic Incursion expansion. Haven't played enough to see the full potential of the reward deck, but seems that its mere existence influences the incentives to helf the defence (which is good). Mostly I can play CE with 6 now. I doubt I'll be getting another expansion though - CI is a good one.

Juego de cartas, en el que cada jugador tiene un poder especial.
Te pasas toda la partida jugando, aunque no sea tu turno, por que hay alianzas y muchas cartas se pueden jugar en cualquier momento.
Tiene una rejugabilidad impresionante, por todas las razas que hay. Ademas aún no hemos jugado con las tecnologías, que seguramente le dean un  sabor diferente a las partidas.
Me está gustando tanto, y me parece tan divertido, que le doy el preciado 10.

There's something strangely amusing about this game of pure social interaction.  The asymmetrical alien powers really make this game interesting but it is ultimately a very group dependent game.

[1 play] Learning game for me. I'm not sure it made sense to me why players would worry about the size of a ship stack being 1-4 in height when the red attack cards could easily vary by 10 to 30 points in value. That seemed too random and distastefully luck of the draw. But I'll reserve final judgment until I can read about that more and then play it again. 

I must be missing something or we just had a screwy game where my opponents got all of the high cards and I never saw one above a 10. I felt like I had no control over my destiny and going through the motions of allying and so forth was just an illusion of control for just a basically random exercise.

The overall theme appealed to me, and I like the idea of forced confrontations, negotiations, and shifting alliances. Hopefully it will get cleared up for me with another session. The FF edition sure looks pretty and I'd like an excuse to covet it.

Sits in between the original Eon version and AHs stripped-down version. Decent looking bits (Alien cards a nice and large) and the same good old CE gameplay.

Expect lots of furious attacking, backstabbing, deal making and deal breaking as players jostle to win the game. Can run a little long with the full complement of players.

Cosmic Encounter scratches that diplomacy itch, while being shorter than Diplomacy, and more interesting than Risk.

The game is random due to random hands of cards and the Cosmic Deck determining the target of attack, but it has more player interaction than Risk because attackers and defenders are using allies constantly.

Due to the design of the game, there are no real long-standing alliances followed by a sudden betrayal. But the positive side is that the combat is up-front and center immediately. While games can still take an hour or longer, there will always be something going on that affects you.

A completely unbalanced negotiation game that can lead to multiple winners and its entire premise is based around prolonging the game.  A neat idea that has some nice components being from fantasy flight but a game that falls a little flat and definitely does not live up to all the hype.  Take it or leave it.

Variable Powers. I see the appeal, but it's not really for me. Didn't help that the first game we played (1 guy teaching, 1 guy "played before" and 3 noobs) we had all the expansions and everything, resulting in some players being dealt advanced races, etc. Seemed long for what it was.

Update: new retheme/redesign coming from FFG - Game of Thrones: the Iron Throne.

I bought this game expecting great things. All of the reviews I read said that this is the greatest game ever, so when I sat down to play it I had high expectations. This game is far too random for my tastes, it feels as though it's a mindless strategy-less game. Draw a card, attack that player... It's like 4-way war where someone is holding the best cards...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The game mechanics of this game are terrible.  Stripping out the negotiation aspect you are just randomly attacking people and hoping to have the better card in your hand, very similar to War (the card game).

Now that isn't exactly fair since it is a negotiation game, trying to convince others to ally with you.  This feels like 90% of the game.  The problem is more often than not allying with someone doesn't actually affect the outcome.  Also, the powers in the game are crazy and unbalanced.  

Add all this together with the fact that the game is too long for what it is.  I would rather just play a short game of Resistance if I want to play a pure social game.

I want to play this game lots. I simply find that I can't get the right group for this. It is loose, it is fun, it is chaotic, it is a blast, but with the wrong group it can be just plain painful. I really dislike the ability to have shared victories, I think no self respecting gamer should be satisfied with that, and as a result I am often disappointed with the ending. The first time I played this game I was blown away. Subsequent plays have been far less enjoyable. With the sweet spot of a group this would be an easy 9. An old game that somehow feels like a breath of fresh air.

Nem gondoltam volna, hogy a Munckinnek volt előzménye, pedig úgy tűnik igen. A Cosmic Encounter egy az egyben Munckin csak sci-fi világba ültetve. Abban más a játék, hogy itt egymás bolygóit támadják a játékosok, de azt, hogy éppen a soron levő játékos kiét, az szerencsével dől le, de legalább nem nyílt a konfliktus. A két fél bármelyik további játékost hívhatja segítségül, akik további űrhajókkal szállnak be a támadásba vagy védésbe a két aktív fél csatahajói mellé. Ezután egy-egy kártyát játszik ki a két fél, ami befolyásolhatja a csatában levő űrhajók számát vagy bármilyen egyéb dolgot tehet. Ezután összehasonlítják az űrhajók számát. Ha támadók nyernek, megvethetik a lábukat az ellenfél bolygóján, ha védő, akkor a támadók visszavonulnak. A játékban öt idegen bolygó megszállásával lehet nyerni. Ennyi a játék. A változatosságot a renget fajta kártya adja és a minden játékos számára adott fajkártya. Ezek a fajkártyák a mi játékunkban eléggé kiegyenlítettnek tűntek, de mégsem ez döntött a játékossorrendről a végén. Szerintem túl egyértelmű, hogy mindig a támadó mellé kell állni, amíg az nem esélyes a végső győzelemre, hisz így mi is csak nyerünk ha őt segítjük. Elképzelhető, hogy egy játékos sorra sem kerül és a játék vége, az ilyet nagyon nem szeretem. Cserében a játék tényleg nem hosszú. A szerencse szerepe óriási, hisz az, hogy kit támadnak kártyahúzással dől el. Nem az én stílusom a játék, de a Munckinnál jobban tetszett a kicsit kötöttebb szabályai miatt.

Such a great game. I love negotiating, I love the card play. The one thing I dont like is that someone can completely betray someone very easily if their power is over powered. I dont like to separate the powers because I feel like that is silly. Complete randomness is way better.

I like the combat phases but if you have all low attack cards, even with negotiation, you can lose your whole fleet and cause terrible wounds to others. I wish this was slightly different

[b]Best 4 Player Game Award[/b]

[i]Hall of Famer. No Two Games are Alike![/i]

[b]100+ Logged Plays Award[/b]

In the words of Peter Olotka: This game is for smart people with a sense of humor. That isn't a diss to those who don't like it (well, only in an indirect passive-aggressive sort of way) but it means anyone of any gaming background (or non gaming background) can enjoy it if they have those two qualities. This is the often overlooked gateway game.

This game's so good to me, and so polarizing with others, that I can often get an accurate feel for how compatible a gaming partner I am with someone based on their opinion of this game alone

Cosmic Encounter refuses to be classified as a game that is loved by a certain type of person. I've had equal success with it as a gateway game, with hardcore gamers, and in some cases even the oddball pure-Euro gamer. It's interesting, it's well designed, and it's the holy grail of variety. There's a lot of game that comes from the "board", but there's also a large social element and "playing the players." It is designed so that everyone can feel involved at all times (if they want to be) -- and "downtime" in the usual sense of the word is meaningless because of it.

Every game plays differently. Every, single, one... that means that this is literally THE game I'd choose to take in one of those "if you were stranded on a desert island..." questions. Really, really, really strong replay value here. Some people have been playing it for decades...

I can understand it not being for everyone, but this is often a game that is misunderstood -- things that irritate some people actually seem to me like brilliant and careful design decisions.

Things like the fact that you (normally) cannot choose who you want to attack or the fact that multiple people can share a victory seem to irritate some people, but the random attacks and shifting alliances are essentially checks and balances (some of the only ones the game has) to open up the design space to create some truly awesome alien powers that would have been broken otherwise. And shared wins are what stop the game from becoming a drawn-out and degenerate "bash the leader" fest every single time -- if you can't beat em, join em! Now lets play again.

It's a good trade-off, because Cosmic Encounter is the most fun, unapologeticly asymmetric game that I know of. This design simply wouldn't work without the elements it does have. That makes it a perfect design.

And you know what else? It really, really does test your mettle at dealing with unforseen situations and manipulating your unforseen fates and fortunes as they come. We have seen as many consistent winners in our plays of this as we have in other FFA games of more obvious skill. Despite all of the chaos, almost every single game I lose, I walk away thinking about what I could have done to win. I feel like I have achieved a level of expertise in this game, but after 50+ plays I'm still learning every single time.

I don't think that that's an accident, either -- I firmly believe that this game was well crafted and play tested with specific intentions and goals. That's the difference between a chaotic game like Cosmic Encounter and one like Fluxx. One is my most love game, and one is my most hated.

That's not to say that Cosmic Encounter is not a chaotic and unpredictable game that rewards luck of the draw. Because it certainly is. But no matter what its detractors will tell you, it rewards knowledge, negotiation, creativity, risk-analysis, and careful planning more

That's not to say that the game is always fair -- it purposefully and proudly trades "fair" for interesting, hilarious, and dynamic. Those qualities are already enough to make a game worth playing, even if just for the fun of it -- the fact that in addition, yes, there is a game of skill here too, is what makes this the best game of all time.

I'm not sure there exists a multiplayer game that would suit me more than this. But it's an exciting (and scary) thought...

[hr]

[b]2 player[/b]: Not an officially supported mode, but actually works with dual alien powers and no destiny deck. Ban any aliens that are ally dependent and therefore useless (Parasite, Sapient, Observer, etc.)
[b]3 player:[/b] Compared to higher player counts, more about hand management and power usage and less about diplomacy and negotiation. Fast!
[b]4 player:[/b] Flexible - can occasionally be an epic game of intrigue, but is more often a fast 30-45 minute knife fight in a dark alley
[b]5 player:[/b] More interesting power interactions usually happen once you hit 5.
[b]6 player[/b]: Heavy on diplomacy and "playing the table." Really need to set yourself up for the win.
[b]7 player:[/b] 6 player, but bigger. Can be really epic. Lots of diplomacy. "Offense only" aliens should probably be avoided as a pick, unless they are very powerful. 
[b]8 player:[/b] Like 7 player but bigger.

[b]Expansions:[/b] Cosmic Incursion is fantastic, both its aliens and rewards deck. Cosmic Conflict aliens are great. Hazard deck is good, but there is one card in it I think is too Fluxx-like (temporal anomaly) which makes me not always want to use Hazards. Cosmic Alliance is hit and miss, but it has a few unforgettable aliens. Cosmic Storm is weak. Cosmic Dominion is maybe the best expansion, but is really for seasoned players so start with Incursion.

This seems to be a love hate game depending on the group. I guess the social and negotiation aspect of this game does not appeal to everyone. I find it fascinating how seemingly weak alien powers can still easily win the game since it's all about who to team up with and when.

This was the first game I played with my group. So yes, I was still a little nervous because you don't want to be introduced to someone and then get your butt kicked by them. And of course my character is FILTH! Yes, his abilities are great but come on, a pile of poo? Great first impression! Oh well, I played the game and didn't end up too bad. And guess the impression wasn't as bad as I thought because I am still invited to game nights, lol. But this game is fun and would love to play it more often.

I just don't get this one. There must be something more to it that I missed. Everyone seems to agree that this is one of the greatest games ever, and yet no one can make me see why. Maybe another play or two--hopefully with someone who really loves it--will clear it up, but I'm not very hopeful. Is it possible that this has been surpassed by the many games that borrowed from it, and that people are just too nostalgic to admit it? That's my working theory.

Updated 5->7 after a few more plays. Essentially a negotiation game, in which players try to position themselves to lunge ahead to their fifth point with no help. Improves as people figure it out.

Cosmic Encounter is a very difficult game to rate. The amount of fun you'll have playing this game varies immensely from game to game. It alle depends on the group you're playing with and what kind of aliens and cards each player has/gets during the game. It can be a lot fun or just mediocre.

RATING: 9
Have only played one game so far. I think the game does a great job re: alliances, attacks, and kingmaking. We played with the basic powers and they were easy enough to understand but still fun to play with. The cards can easily screw you, but managing your hand, and adjusting your goals can mitigate that. A fun game that I'd like to play some more. EDIT: awesome fun, even with four. You'd think that in a game where you don't choose who you attack, that you'd be frustrated all the time, but the alliances and cards open the game up tremendously.

I confess that I still don't quite understand this game.  The negotiation aspect feels prescriptive - either you're giving away a home planet, or you're trying to sell the swill left in your hand.  Combat also feels random - don't expect to win with less than a 20.  Winning seems largely based on negotiation skill, but I feel like there's not enough complexity to vary your bargaining chips, much less acquire anything of worth.  I do like the racial abilities and the corresponding superpower cards a lot.  Playing in teams seems to give this game playability in absence of negotiation tools.

Chaos lovely chaos. Cool components, clear rules, lots of negotiating, coercing, sweet-talking, and a tremendous amount of variety and unpredictability. Once you've played a dozen times, you'll want to play a dozen times again.

I've also got the Cosmic Incursion expansion, about which: I wish that the reward deck had the same card back style as the normal draw deck. Still, it's nice to have all those new aliens. 

And the Cosmic Conflict expansion now, too! About which I will write more when I retrieve it from PA.

* Too often did the "wait what happens here?" scenario rear its ugly head.
* Games start to feel too long when you have an alien you don't want to keep.
* Lopsided alien card strengths.

I need more plays -- both times I played I was underwhelmed.  I know there's a fun experience here!  Just not sure how to obtain it yet.  *Update* - I'm done trying to get this one.  There's just way too many random cards and expansions with more random cards that can change the game at any time without anyone having any idea of it happening.  Along with that you have the trouble of attacking someone that perhaps you didn't want to attack.  I'm done with this one.

I feel that this game's fun heavily depends on the people you are playing with - it is not a Euro game and people who delight in forming engines and working out optimal (or closer to optimal than their opponents) may find this game too random for their liking. I think all the games I've played have involved green aliens - I would be keen to try and play with and against yellow and red powered aliens.

RATING: 8.5
Utterly splendid game when everyone gets a chance to have an encounter and feel involved (which didn't happen in the only six player game I've played) Not quite as good with 3 or 6+ players and some games are much better than others, perhaps because some aliens are more interesting than others and the draw of the cards - make sure they're shuffled well (REALLY IMPORTANT) else the same people keep having encounters!

Certainly some nostalgia for this one for me, since I played this a bunch in high school. I like the varied powers and how they make each game unique in how they interact.

I own all 5 expansions and there is a reason this game is timeless. It is impossible to play with all alien combos in a single lifetime and it is great seeing peoples reactions for the first reveal to see how much they were just boned.

The flare cards and all the added expansion components really do add another level of enjoyment to the game. However even the core game is perfect because it is a smooth intro to the world of cosmic encounters.

My only critique is you really need a good group of people to play with and it is best with 5-6 people.

More than any other game I know, you need the right group. But with the right group, it's fantastic. I love the alliances, backstabbing, and asymmetry. Cosmic is chaotic, sure, but it's a game that produces lots of "Remember when..." moments. 

Almost everyone should try it, though not everyone will like it. It's for those who are in it for the group experience more than anything else, people who can let go a little, who can ride in the passenger seat without worrying about the destination. That's not to diminish the skill involved. Good players win often. But the route to victory is never the same. Aliens in play, cards in hand, and the players at the table determine the best course. Some players delight in finding a way to chart and navigate that course. Others don't care to. It's difficult to predict with confidence which category any given person will fall into.

RATING: 7
A little too Ameritrash for my taste, but still totally fun. The diverse alien "powers" are an amazingly cool concept that totally makes the game. Cosmic was in its prime as a game when I was about 3 years old, so I am unable to feel nostalgic about it the way others might.

RATING: 7.5
A fun game, and I can see why it is popular. I enjoy playing it, but it will never be my favourite game. The reason for this is that the level of enjoyment comes down to the group you're playing with. There isn't much game there and while that's refreshing for a change the experience almost entirely relies on your gaming comrades.

I've only played this once...my gut feel is that it's either a 7 or 8 rating.

The conditions weren't ideal when I introduced the game and ultimately it went down as a failure (11:45PM and everyone had been heavily drinking).

I thought it had lots of potential & was willing to play again, but 2 of the 5 players vetoed it in favour of something else.

It's a dynamic and swift game. Although I'm not enamored with it on the first try, I think I'll like it more after more plays. I think the main feature of this game is the random attack, which is a good feature. Random attack makes players switch alliance back and forth, creating a very interactive social experience, much like that of coup reformation. At first, the game appeared it might be a long game. But the 5 colonies wining condition is quiet easy to fulfill, making the game short and sweet. This game also has high replay value, as is true for social interaction games.

RATING: 9
What's great about this game is how simple the basic mechanics are but how much depth and variety it can still have.  One of my biggest turn-ons with a game is variety and re-playability (which typically go hand-in-hand), the more the better.  Usually variety makes games a lot more complicated though and the majority of my game group is more on the casual side and turned off by overly-complicated games.  The rules and mechanics for Cosmic Encounter are pretty simple though.  I think I spent the shortest amount of time ever explaining this game to four other new players before we got started.  Also, the theme is great and the world seems fully fleshed.

Where the depth comes in is mostly with the alien powers and also with various card effects (flash and artifacts in particular) and how they interact.  Everything seems explained pretty well on the cards too so we had little downtime from just trying to understand ability and card interactions.

A friend of mine described this as chaotic.  He is absolutely right.  Once the cards and racial abilities started flying it was mayhem and I loved every second of it.  I love chaotic, wild games as long as there is a way for me to wrap my head around and corral it to my benefit.  The same friend also accused this game as being so chaotic that there was very little opportunity for even tactical decision making.  This I think he was wrong about.

Yes, the game can be random and flash cards in particular can throw a monkey-wrench in the best laid plans but when your racial ability and cards are used intelligently and you've observed the player turns closely enough I saw a lot of opportunities for decisions that really played the system.

In fact the player who said this did something by accident that if he had meant to do it would have been an excellent move (it was still an excellent move actually, albeit accidental).  We had been fast enemies during the beginning of the game and when his turn next rolled around he asked me to be an offensive ally saying "let's let bygones be bygones".  He committed one ship to the fight (which counted as 4 since he was the Macron) and I threw 4 in there as well thinking our strength of 8 against the defense's strength of 4 had it won easy.  The defense played a low power attack and I KNEW the offense had a high-enough power attack to win the battle...and he played a negotiate.  Losing only one ship in the attack and sending four of mine to the warp.  He didn't realize that I would commit 4 ships in what I thought was a sure win and more-over didn't even think about how playing a Negotiate would lose me all those ships.  It was still a blow to me that if on purpose would have been great tactical gaming based on observation and playing the game mechanics in an unusual way to your own favor.

Well this isn’t a new game for me per se. As a child I played the Swedish translation "universums härskare", published by Alga, like a thousand times, but I haven’t played it as a adult. This new version was a blast; all the different things - the technologies, the flares, the silly unbalanced feeling of the alien’s powers - made it really enjoyable. Compare to it the old Swedish version are really poor, both in production and in content. This is a game (this version) that I am going to play many, many times in the future, I hope.

Cosmic Encounter has a rich history on the board game world and I have the Mayfair edition collecting dust on my shelf.  I do enjoy playing the game. I just don’t have a lot of yearning to play it.

Cosmic Encounter is one of my tens, but it's funny because I don't even like it that much.  It earns its ranking because I am always willing to play it and that has not changed for three years.  There is just so much wacky bullshit here that the game is always entertaining, if not necessarily fun or worth playing.  Not exactly sure how to describe it.  All I can say is it gets a 10 by BGG rankings, but it's not my favorite game or even one of them.

EDIT: It's still inexplicable why I like this game so much, but I'd say it's no longer true that it's not one of my favorite games. Cosmic Dominion truly helped elevate this game into my top ten. I still think I should hate it, but what can a man do?

EDIT 2: This is now my favorite game. It played its way into my heart and I couldn't imagine a game collection without it. Good job, you rotten rat bastard of a game. Good job.

Not as pretty as the AH version, but soooo much more variety! This version is notably harder to play; the cards are very text-dense, and the long paragraphs of explanation aren't really any clearer than earlier versions. Flares are confusing and a bit dull.
I really want to like CE, but overall I feel like there's just not really much game here. There are supposed to be all these cool interactions between powers and different cards, but mostly they just don't materialize, and it's just "flip a counter. Play the 30. OK, win the fight".

RATING: 7
Cosmic Encounter is hilarious and fun.  All the different alien races and cards can make the game unbalanced, but who cares, just band together with your friends.  Most of the powers and cards have specific times they can be used anyway, so even if someone does seem overpowered, it is typically limited.

Overall it is just a wonderful 45  minutes to spend with buddies.  It isn't that strategic compared to the modern Euro game, but it doesn't try to be.  It is a timeless classic.

One note is that some people may feel this game is too mean spirited, but a lot of the meanness is mandatory and the rest is just funny instead of mean.  Played with strangers could be dicey, but could also serve to break the ice with laughter.

The simple mechanic makes this game very playable. There's a lot of depth added by the large variety of different aliens available to play with, each with their own unique skill. This in turn provides a great deal of replay value to the game due to the huge variety of ways each race potentially interacts with each other. Virtually every game plays quite differently from previous ones and a successful tactical approach to a certain game may not work in future games.

Rated '6' after initial rating, 2012. FFG version.

[EDIT Feb 2014] Played this again and it remains a strange mismatch of 'godawful lot of cool player powers' versus 'mediocre gameplay'. 

Enjoyable, but not a brilliant game. Revised rating to 6.8 as we did enjoy the game.

[EDIT Sep 2014] Hah. Revised again upwards to 7.5, after we've discovered we had been playing a critical phase wrong all these times: we first asked any offensive allies, had them answer and only then asked defensive allies. Now we discovered that you only do the invitation, but not the acceptance until both parties have had their chance to invite. This is a small, but crucial difference and it suddenly makes the gameplay much more exciting. Especially if you have races in play that key off refused alliances (Grudge) or succesfull defenses (Tic-tock) or failed Offense (Spiff). 

This makes the game system go from 'ok, bit boring, resolve' to 'tense, tense, resolve'.

Still, flares do seem a bit overpowered, player races seem not all balanced but these are typically things that have to grow on you (i.e. can be negated by 'experienced player balance'). So I will not be surprised if the rating will be revised upwards ever still with more replays.

[NOV 2016] Rated revised yet again upwards by one half. Has become a staple game of our yearly game-weekend, always getting at least one play which is enjoyed by all. Keeps being fresh and I keep getting my ass handed to myself on a plate. Ah well, maybe that is the appeal (to finally gang up on that unbeatable guy with all the game knowledge) :D

Luckily, I can have that and enjoy the wild ride in the face of unsurmountable odds. :)

I like the game after one play. It's really unforgiving; one player was basically out of the game for half of the time since he made some bad decisions.
It tends to take a while to play especially first few games, since you've got to read and focus on multiple cards at a time. It feels a bit slow and we tend to stop using powers and some of the cards because we get bored of reading all the aspects, but it's a fun game. I definitely want to play it at least a couple more times.

The game is an absolute blast. It plays differently every time, and I find it relatively easy to teach to a new group. It's a game even non-gamers can play. Perhaps one of the best party games I've ever tried short of Apples to Apples.

For hardcore gamers, there is a ton of strategy tucked under the accessible upper crust. The game plays quickly, involves a lot of cajoling, lying and laughing and has gorgeous artwork.

The one criticism I have of the game is that the ending often feels anti-climactic. Someone just gains a fifth colony, usually with little fanfare or bombast. The game is too fun and has too much chaotic bombast to just end like that, without any sense of penultimate chaos or struggle.

The best feature is most likely the move-able planets, warp and hyperspace gate that replace any sort of board. It adapts nicely to any table space you may have.

Let's forget that this is game about alien races taking over planets in other alien systems, forget the intense negotiation, and the bluffing, and the cool alien superpowers, and the fact that you can win jointly, or go for the glory all yourself if you choose, forget all that, because the one thing you need to know is that the game is infinitely repayable.  Each game you will pick a new alien race, there are hundreds each with their own special powers, some with their own special decks,you will never have the same combination of races in any game, so every game is inherently different.  This game is so very fun, it's engaging, has tense bluffing and cool powers.  The one thing about the game is that it can take half and hour or two and half depending on how you play how lucky you are, risks you take etc.  So you can't really say "let's have a quick game," because there really is no telling how long the game take.  I love playing with new cool powers each time, I love the bluffing, I love that you can decide how you win, the game is great and I'll never say no to it.

A blast with 4 or more players. Highly interactive, with little downtime provided you can join the fray as an ally. I find 5-6 players is the sweet spot (base game plays up to 5), as adding more players increases the risk of the game finishing before everyone has had a chance to attack as a main player.

I owned the AH version and fell in love with the game despite the AH version being a neutered version. The FFG is an incredible offering and definitely feels like the definitive version.

On CE itself, this is the king of negotiation games, and the best chaotic game out there. There is plenty of decisions to be made, but that doesn't mean there isn't some luckiness that creeps in. 

However, how you play your cards and your power(s) and interact with the other players will mean much more than the cards you draw. That is the mark of a great game.

Remake of an old game where everything is random and cheating is encouraged. Cooperation and diplomacy are encouraged too.

RATING: 5
Having some difficulties with this game.  There is no reason not to invite everyone but those ahead of you or perhaps tied with you in victory.  Thus only the final winning attack really matters, and I've seen games end even before my first turn because of this.

Typically it is often the entire table against one defender, making the actual encounter almost meaningless.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Finally got around to playing this (something I've wanted to do for years now.)  It's mechanically simpler than I was expecting and seems to benefit from having a larger group (although I can imagine 6 or 7 players would really increase the downtime.)  It's interesting and I found myself really drawn to the sheer number of  alien races (50 or so with awesome artwork), which adds a fair bit of replayability.  We played with 2 races each making for interesting mechanic combinations that seemed to add a fair bit to the game.  Of course, because of this nature, it could result in the game being wildly unbalanced, should players clue in alliances should compensate.  

The stacking plastic UFOs are pretty cool as well and the overall production value is as high as I would expect from any Fantasy Flight product.  At its core it's a chaotic hand management game (very luck driven), where it seems pertinent to utilize your worst cards effectively.  This is where I found the game would shine, in its devious backstabbing, negotiation or use of flares and powers to help compensate for these cards (who doesn't enjoy a little player interaction and bluffing.)  This leads to the games true nature, the players interactions.  This means that the group you play with is key to your enjoyment of this game, negotiation, diplomacy, betrayal and the ability to analyze your powers strategically are pivotal traits in your group.  .

I bought this game because I heard it had good replay value, wasn't too long and could accommodate a large amount of players.

Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed at all, and am now hooked to the game. I'm constantly trying to get my friends to play with me, and I've been having at least one session of Cosmic every week with my friends ever since I bought it. It's easy to lose track of time when playing it, and often we'll keep playing much longer than we probably should. After one game is done, we'll say to each other "Come on, man, just one more game..."

It rarely ever ends with just one.

This is a fun game with plenty of chaos and randomness thrown in.  The different races have plenty to differentiate themselves from one another, with some being more powerful than others.  The Destiny Deck ensures that one player isn't picked on until he's wiped out, and the ever-changing alliances make for some fun ganging up every once in a while as well.

My rating on this is quavering between 7 and 8. What I love about it is the simplicity of the basic rules, the variance from game to game, and the interactive elements (bluffing in particular). I have problems however with the massive luck factor and wonky endgame. Regardless of how much that stuff bothers me, the game itself is definitely fun and with certain groups I can see it being a top choice.

I tried this game twice. The first time, it was with only three people and the guy explaining the rules did a poor job. Also, it was an older, worse version of the game. It was boring. The second time was also with only three people and the guy who owned it was a super fan (we played his original Eon copy). We also played with multiple alien powers that changed every turn. It was terrible.
After a lot of reflection, I realized that it wasn't Cosmic Encounter that was the problem. I got this as a gift, and I'm excited to try it with four or more people who aren't going to spread on a thick layer of unconscionable house-rules.

Update - Recent play of this game has proved my suspicion correct: it is a lot of fun with the proper approach. The game can still sometimes be frustrating and a little too complex, but the negotiation and deal-making is great.

RATING: 8
Really like this game after I started to get a handle on how to play it properly. The number of different alien powers is incredible (50 in the base game, lots more with expansions) and they completely change how you approach the game each time.

Update: I've found that the amount of chaos can really put off some people, particularly those who prefer more strategic games, but the game is great with the right group. It's basically about using the alien powers and cards to keep your opponents from scoring that last point, while allying and saving your cards for the right time to score the final point yourself. The game seems best with about four players, as with more players it can go on for too long and have too much downtime if you don't have a power that be used while allying.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 5[/b]
If everybody knows the game well, it's fine to play with 6. But for practicality with any new players, 5 is best. You still get a good mix of aliens and alliances and big battles, but with a faster play time than with 6. At lower player counts just play something else.

Fall 2014. Started tracking games late. Add about 10 to the number of plays.

RATING: 7
My first three plays of CE were a huge disappointment. I found zero strategy and long-term strategy planning is what usually gets me excited about a game. After I played it about three times, I tried to give up my desired for strategy and just play it for what it is, a cut-throat, random, back-stabbing game. Since then I've grown to appreciate it more and have had more fun with my sessions of Cosmic Encounter.

My trade interest is low at this point, but would still consider intriguing trade offers.

1/8/12 -- NOT FOR TRADE anymore! I don't usually love games with tons of chaos. But CE does it well. I really like the interesting combos that happen based on diplomacy and tricky card play. The slogan of the game it "A Game of Infinite Possibilities". It lives up to this name because I don't remember any of my games feeling even close to the same. Further, crazy things happen every time I play. 

If you go into this game with the right attitude, you will enjoy it. And that's exactly what happened last weekend. After playing it late one night during the holiday. My family couldn't wait to play it again the next day! Success!

Being that I'm pretty wary of games that call for negotiation and potential backstabbing, I liked how the game basically chooses your opponents. This helps cut down either being picked on, or (if you're like me) worrying about who I might annoy or offend by attacking them.

The alien powers add nice variability and the game was surprisingly short. I can see how this game could create some very memorable moments. At heart, I think this is almost a party game.

This isn't so much a game as it is an engine driving interaction. A few weeks ago, my group played the gamiest of eurogames. It took three hours and none of us said a word the entire time, except for rules clarifications. I don't remember anything about that game. And then we pulled out Cosmic Encounter for a post-intensity cool down, and the contrast was incredible. We were talking, joking, laughing, and we all had a great time.

It's not the fleshiest of games, and it's not even the best at what it does (I prefer the Resistance as a social game), but if you've got it around it's always worth a play.

There's a reason this game has survived the test of time and several remakes.  Every race is over powered in their own way.  Nothing is for certain.  It's poker meets diplomacy.  Lots of variety already, but comes with variants like technology to add to it.  No two games will be the same.  Great meaty game.  Play with 4 planets for a faster game.

My first play of this game was terribly frustrating as I felt I got stuck with a completely useless alien race before I knew anything about the game and therefor had the game play me rather than the other way around. Regardless, I was fascinated by what others were able to do while I was getting stomped and as a result I know try to play every time I get the chance (unfortunately a rare event).

3-6 players.

draw from a deck to see who you have to attack, the first player with 5 colonies on foreign players wins.

RATING: 5
I've liked this less with each play instead of more, which probably isn't a good sign.

I feel like the game is extremely chaotic, almost to the point where openly trying not to win is almost a viable strategy...I can see the fascinating part of that but it generally is not what I am looking for in games.

It's nearly impossible to have any real plans, as there is always some power or card just around the corner that will render those plans useless.

The tactical negotiations are fairly pointless in my eyes, building long-term alliances is simply a pipe-dream that will rarely if ever work out due to the randomness of encounters and the basic human nature of doing what is best for yourself.  You can beg and plead for people to join your side but unless some players are complete rubes, your cajoling will not change minds.

At the end of the day the player who gets the best cards, flies under the radar the best and ultimately gets to take a turn with a great hand and 4 colonies already in play will get the win...or worse multiple players will just dog pile a victory.

I get that people appreciate the game for the experience and the humorous stories that might emerge -- but I find that just as often the game is aggravating and a little bland.

On the plus side it plays in about an hour so I don't mind giving it a go, but I'd pretty much always prefer something else.

Only 1 play, but seemed kind of pointless back and forth by the end. It's hard to be engaged when it's so affected by random card draws. Negotiation aspect is ok, but there are so many games that do it better. If everyone isn't invested in the game play then the game can go off the rails pretty easy. There are just too many negatives to waste time on this game, when there are so many games to do what this game does better. I was reading the comments of users who rate this game highly and there were many that apologized for the poor design and the uninspired game play. It kind of tells me that this game is kind of overrated.

First Impression:

A chaotic negotiation game with a space theme.

High replayability thanks to the various aliens.

Too random and pointless for me. I like negotiations/battles where something is at stake, but here nothing is at stake and every battle is the same boring and repeated process as before. This forces alliances to form either for a few more cards, or to simply bash the leader. Of course certain talented players will find a way to make this game work better, thanks to their "diplomatic" skills and imagination, but for me this game doesn't encourage any meaningfull negotiations.

A downright solid game. Easy to learn, easy to set up. Out of all the 'Galactic Domination' themed games, board or otherwise, this is the best I've seen.

Disappointing. I had high hopes given all of the praise for this classic, but after trying the new Fantasy Flight edition, I don't see what all the fuss is about. If I want to play a fairly random battle game with variable player powers, I'll stick with Dune. I know Cosmic Encounter has the advantage of being much quicker, but I found the sheer randomness of the cards in Cosmic Encounter to be more offensive than the already extremely random distribution of potentially very powerful cards in Dune. The decision-making in the combat seems highly outweighed by the potentially high-numbered cards. The variable player powers are interesting and I'm sure far ahead of their time when first conceived, but experiencing them for the first time in 2009 make it harder to appreciate their original genius, given all of the advances in the science during the intervening years. I've been enjoying a lot of Fantasy Flight games lately like Descent: Journeys in the Dark, Battlestar Galactica, A Game of Thrones, and War of the Ring, but this offering fell flat for me.

CE is the game I like the most in 2011 (of the ones I first played in that year). I like the different races, the asymmetric powers, the table (trash) talk, the interactions (and sometimes then "take that" card throwing) among players.

The game sure is not for everyone (shy people my suffer) and there is somewhat the "bash the leader", though is more like "avoid calling the leader to the party", as the Destiny deck avoid some of bashing.

Overall, a great game (for me)!

Lots of fun for this tactical game...it varies a lot too with the massive range of aliens, and their game-breaking abilities that they have.

The main issue is that who you're playing needs to know the gist of the game...you can end up helping people and them winning before you even get a turn..!

But that's just learning the game.  Once you do, it's great fun.

One of those games that when played with the right combination of alien powers and friends delivers incredible amounts of fun.

I was pretty excited to play this game as it seemed the alien powers are very cool.  For me, it is a mediocre game as I tend not to like 'gang up on the one is winning' type of game.  It sucks in games sometimes as the person who is winning it is as easy as the other team members not letting you win as to how the game is played.  Although, it is still a good game and fun, I didn't care for the battles much either as they were just overly in favor of either winning or losing, no dice, no gotcha's much.  A great social game though and trying to get allies to help or help defend.  I do enjoy the game, just not as much as some of my others.

Most folks either love or hate this game. The haters generally don't like the fact that some races can seem overpowered. "Runaway leader syndrome" can be combated by recognizing it early and ganging up.

The potential for bluffing, negotiation, backstabbing, etc. make this game really interesting. Add in the variable powers attributed to each player, and it becomes a very different game each time you play.

Finally got to play this edition, much fun! Cosmic players are saying this is a great edition with lots of necessary stuff, and there is expected to be an expansion to produce a complete set FINALLY.  It seems like a different game than other editions I've played, but it's probably just the very different bits that cause my mind to forget the previous experience. I really like this game and want to play more.

I've come to the conclusion that the fun in this game is the broken rules and the squabbling over what takes priority.  As long as you play with people who don't argue about fiddly rules and you have fun, which is what gaming is all about! Cosmic Encounter is rapidly becoming one of my favorites. And, now with 3 expansions (edit: 4 expansion), it is getting closer and closer to completeness!

Played the Mayfair version on numerous occasions, and like this version better: The artwork is better, timing issues are non-existent, it allows for managing the complexity level of the game depending on the experience of the players, it has 50(!) alien races to ensure replayability and the rules seem to cater for every situation you can possibly think of. Played the game three times the first time it hit the table, so I guess I am not the only one liking it. In terms of gameplay, it is a unique title to have in your collection.
UPDATE: Even though I had a lot of fun with this game in the past, it fell completely flat with the last two groups I played it with. I do not expect it to get any tablespace anymore, so I traded it away.

My new go-to board game. It's grown on me immensely over the last few years. A simple, flexible core system of bluffing and negotiation with just enough randomness and variation to lead to endlessly interesting game states. It's easy to teach, plays quickly, and is never, ever boring. This is the game I bring out when I play with people who love the negotiation aspect of Catan, and afterwards every single one has declared Cosmic Encounter their favourite game and purchased it for themselves.

Just like any sci-fi themed board game, the potential audience is rather limited within my gaming circle. Female casual gamers just really shy away from high fantasy and sci-fi themes. Moreover, backstabbing games that have high amounts of conflict tend to limit the audience even more. As such, Cosmic Encounter is a game that I would love to play, but would never end up buying a copy.

This classic game really have withstood the onslaught of modern game design. It holds up quite well and is fun to play with the right group. There is plenty of wheeling and dealing and I absolutely enjoy the interaction.

I finally got the opportunity to play this last night. Eh... somewhat underwhelming considering all I'd heard. As others have noted, there seems to be too much chaos to allow for much actual strategy. Also, the numerous special cards, powers, exceptions, etc. are all fodder for rules lawyering that slow everything down.

I don't know... I'd play it again, though I'm not eager to do so. But I'll hold off of rating it just yet.

Perfect mix of theme, fun, interaction, negotiation, alliances, betrayals, grudges and surprises with outstanding components. If you are a strict Eurogamer who wants to build an engine and play within a strict rules framework, run away! Everyone else run toward the light and dive head first into the chaos and laughter that is Cosmic Encounter.

This game is truly one of my ultimate favourite games.  Its easy to learn, teach and play. The rules are simple, but the variety is epic!  The funny tales that still get told years after are truly amazing and testament to my thoughts on it.  I love this game!

My only advice to people is... don't take things too seriously!

I just don't like this game. There was nothing special about it.
You just decided to launch an attack and then play a card. That was all... I don't get the hype. Just not my game.
I only played twice to be fair but the explanation took forever (was a long gap in between :)) and the gameplay just didn't feel appealing... I just didn't get the hype to conquer the other players' planets... the game fell very flat for me, can't recommend it.

RATING: 10
Easily my favorite and most played game of all time. Every play is different because of the HUGE number of possible alien and flare combinations. We love the Douglas Adams-esque flavor of it,as well. Crazy, lucky, social, strategic, and just plain fun in a box! 

Needs the Cosmic Incursion expansion for the Defender Rewards deck, in my experience, to make allying with the defense more appealing. Also, MORE ALIENS!

Munchkin for Gamers.

A game of gang up on the leader, kingmaking, and arbitrary winners.  Someone will near victory, players will burn cards trying to stop that player from winning, allowing most (or all) other players to catch up.  The game then continues until one player has the right card or player power to pull off a win and everyone else has run out of cosmic and card zaps.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Far too often this game relies on chance (random race) and having everyone join in for attacking.  By the end of the game, 2 people are almost sure to win if they work together and everyone else will be tied for 2nd place.  Backstabbing is also very common.

A classic design that excels at putting players on conflict early and often, and keeps everyone involved. The alien powers keep the game radically different every time. I suggest playing with 4 planets, 16 ships, and two alien races each, and racing to 4 foreign colonies.

RATING: 8.5
Game is really wonderful for fielding a lot of players at the same time while never being boring since every move involves every player.  There's a mind-boggling amount of variability through aliens to every match that you'll never play the same game twice.

As with all games that rely on heavy player involvement, the game can fall a little flat if you're playing with a lot of quiet, un-confrontational players.  If you get a great group of boisterous personalities though, all the pleading and conniving and under-handed deals, it's can just be amazing fun.

1st update (Mar 2011)[?]: Having owned this game for quite a while now; it was a major disappointment, mostly for my girlfriend. She feels the downtime is way too big for the amount of game you get. I feel the same. However, I have decided to see if I can get a few more plays (without her) to give my final judgement.

Too random to feel strategic, but the powers do have a lot of potential for awesome "take that" moments.

It gets points for replay value, but loses them for randomness. In the end everyone only got 2 turns before everyone but one player won.

Each player is the leader of an alien race. The object of the game is to establish colonies in other players' planetary systems. On a player's turn, he or she encounters another player on a planet, and both sides are able to invite allies to try and tip the encounter in their favor.

Used to be my favorite game, but these days I prefer more freedom in decisions as well as additional complexity. That being said, Cosmic does have a lot of strategy. It's got alliances, negotiation, backstabbing, really cool alien power interactions, and essentially endless variety. Sometimes the rules with alien powers and flare cards can be foggy, 
Expansions spice it up with even more variety and aliens. I didn't buy Storm, but I own all the others and am glad for it.

Oct 2016-Like poker but with Aliens that break the rules! Normally I don't like so much luck but once I learned to treat it like poker but different every time and with some negotiation and persuasion elements I learned to love this game. Its replay-ability is endless and lots of memorable moments are bound to come up every time you bring it out for a few plays.

This game really rewards repeat play with experienced players as at first glance, most new players (myself included) don't appreciate all the subtleties such as, it isn't always good to invite allies if they might benefit from helping you rather than vice versa.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
+ Some interesting mechanics
+ Cool special abilities
+ Good art and components

-/? Too complex for what it offers (you can fix it removing some cards)
-/? Very long for what it is (you can fix it playing shorter game, maybe even better with 3 planets)

- So much randomness in such a long game (card values range from 8 to 40 (!fourty!))
- Taking last colony feels almost like taking last level in Munchkin (that's always a good sign, right?)
- Theme pasted on, it could easily be villages or islands or infected organisms with viruses or some other things instead of planets and colonies
- Cards look boring
- May cause anger and whining
- The game shows the worst in the players
- Not everybody can negotiate, for such players game is not fun

I really despise this game in all its incarnations.  It's chaotic, luck-driven groupthink.  I hear this get called a negotiation game sometimes, which makes my skin crawl.  I love negotiation games, but this game is not one of them.  This is a thinly-veiled excuse to form and hold grudges, and doesn't hold any real strategy to it.  It's one of the best examples of 'everybody stop Joe because he's really close to winning oh crap now we have to stop Nora too and oh look now we can't stop Mark and he just won.'  Somehow the BGG hivemind recognizes and hates this in [gameid=1927], but Cosmic gets a free pass.  Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?

This game is completely random and the first 95% of the game is pointless because it comes down to which player with 4/5 foreign colonies is lucky enough to end up with a 5th. That is assuming that it doesn't end in a shared victory, which is even worse. That being said, the gameplay is fun and can be more interesting with multiple-character variants.

In Cosmic Encounter, each player is the leader of an alien race. The object of the game is to establish colonies in other players' planetary systems. Players take turns trying to establish colonies. The winner(s) are the first player(s) to have five colonies on any planets outside his or her home system. A player does not need to have colonies in all of the systems, just colonies on five planets outside his or her home system. These colonies may all be in one system or scattered over multiple systems. The players must use force, cunning, and diplomacy to ensure their victory.

Cosmic Encounter is, at it's core, a pretty dry game. It's hard to see the appeal by simply looking over the rules or watching a video review. Even when one considers all of the crazy alien power interactions, it just doesn't look all that entertaining. Well, looks can be deceiving, because it is wildly fun. The only problem with finding that fun is that everyone needs to be somewhat experienced for it to work. Gameplay is eighty percent negotiation and diplomacy, so it is very easy for someone with a strong or easy-to-use alien power to steamroll to an easy victory. Cosmic Encounter demands that the whole table work together to stop anyone from gaining too much momentum, so if the player's aren't all savvy enough to play defensively, the game is extremely unsatisfying.

It reminds me of Robo Rally a little bit. In the right crowd, it's one of the best games ever designed. In the wrong one, it's an unmitigated disaster waiting to happen.

I really, really wanted to like this game... I love the little flying saucer pieces, and the fact that each alien races has their own unique power, and that their are a ton of them... but the mechanics are broken (the expansions help somewhat, but not enough), and the fact that it nixes the social element down to bare bones... Biggest disappointment I've had in board games so far.

I like that this game is a blending of social interactions along with game bending powers.  With the expansions I cannot imagine having two games play out the same.  I just hope that the artwork, combined with the dense text, on the alien cards won't scare of my wife or other casual gamers.

I only put it as an 8 because, though I really like it (maybe a 9) it is very group dependent and there are some mixes where I would not pull this game out.

A cult classic, this is a game of wild swings in cosmic fortunes. Each player plays an alien race with a special power and must colonize 5 other worlds to win.

I like the variable player powers and the fact that everyone can be involved during every turn. A card telling you who you're attacking obviously gives you less control during your own turn, but it prevents ganging up on a single player, so I can't really complain.

I'd need some more plays to figure out a viable strategy.

Fun negotiation game! Really just a blast to play, and all the different alien races allow for just a really great and different experience every time. One great thing is scales well for any number of playings(never played with the 7 or 8th player). Always a great game to pull out at a game night.

In the depths of space, the alien races of the Cosmos vie with each other for control of the universe.  Players choose from dozens of alien races, each with its own unique power to further its efforts to build an empire that spans the galaxy. A classic game of alien politics. In Cosmic Encounter, each player is the leader of an alien race. The object of the game is to establish colonies in other players' planetary systems. Players take turns trying to establish colonies. The players must use force, cunning, and diplomacy to ensure their victory.

Mind games, betrayal, alliances, negotiations and special powers - a great mixture of different board game features. I had a really good time with this game, but I was lucky to play it with the right people. Your experience with Cosmic Encounter will depend on your gaming group and may be vastly different. 

The only downside is that it takes a while to explain all the rules - it's a simple game, but it's kind of tricky to learn.

Luck of the draw can hurt a little, but most times you are emptying your hand and drawing more and more cards so often that it lessens the blow. If my group liked it as much as I do and I got to play it more I might have even ranked it a bit higher.

Well done reprint.  

I do like the game.  BUT, why does this game get so much love?  It isn't "great" by any means.  Its messy and chaotic and all of those kinds of things - things that pummel the ratings of other games, all while CE is getting tons of love.

I did a lot of research on this game and I knew it would be one that a like.  Then I got it to the table a few times and it was confirmed.  But it wasn't until I played this game at a con (DTC 2015!) that I really had some extremely fun games.  There is deception, backstabbing, chance, manipulation, and excitement all inside of this box.  Its social, encourages constant table talk from all players, and I really enjoy it.

[i]Cosmic Encounter[/i] stands out, for me at least, as one of the best experiences in gaming. It is a game that thrives on constant player-interaction and rampant table-talk as you wheel and deal your way to galactic conquest. It is a social game that can't always be won by brute force and instead requires players to consider their moves (and allies) carefully.

Hand-management, circumstantially-appropriate card play, bluffing and scrutiny of other players all play a huge role in the game and will be your tools to victory. The fact that each player has a unique Alien Power that changes the game in some way and the fact that 50 such Alien Powers come with the base game means that the options and replayability are limitless. No two games will be identical.

I cannot praise this game highly enough. It has a simple core of mechanics that are quick and easy to teach, endless variety thanks to the Alien Powers and is a game in which all players are constantly involved.

I can't call [i]Cosmic Encounter[/i] anything other than what it is: the best, most interesting, most exciting, most memorable and most [b][u]fun[/u][/b] board game I've ever played.

If someone said I could only play one board game for the rest of my life, it would be [i]Cosmic Encounter[/i], without question.

Very basic game that's fun on two premises:
1. The alien powers throw all sorts of chaos into the proceedings, and fun ensues.
2. The people you play with really get into the game, and fun (hopefully) ensues.

It's not a game for everyone, or WITH anyone.
But with the right crowd, it's a blast.

Cosmic is a fun interactive game. Players attack one another and lead support in other players battles in order to spread out their troops. Each player also has a different race which gives them a particular advantage in battles. The interaction is unique and a lot of fun.

I think I'll really like this game once I get the hang of it, I'd like to play it a few more times before passing judgment. As it stands, I know how to play and can actually do reasonably well. I like the theme and the mechanics (people can help you, you can negotiate, there is some secrecy involved) but am not good at the strategic aspect. As usual. I definitely need to learn strategy more but I do like this game overall.

Floating this on the trade market to see if I can swap for someone's collection of Imperial Assault with expansions. This comes in a custom-made foam core insert that holds the base game and the first three expansions (plays up to 8). Love this game, but my group have moved on. 

I love Cosmic Encounter. There's something about the chaos, the bluffing and the constant switching of alliances that make this game really interesting to me. I'm not generally a fan of sprawling, unpredictable games - but this is a favourite for me and my friends. There are so many variations, and so many aliens you can swap in and out that every game is totally different. I have most of the expansions and there are some variants that I haven't even touched despite the fact we've played a lot of Cosmic Encounter!

One of the best and most repayable negotiation games out there. Lots of good stories and memories with this one. If there was only one game I would save to pass down to future generations, it would be this one. 

So much variety and while the game does depend on the right group there is plenty to tweak to make it fun to our group.

For first time players we choose a pool of aliens that will pair well together, and play with the less planet variant. Usually after that anything is fair game to play with.

Excellent negotiation game. Reminds me of the Game of Thrones board game with regard to negotiation and backstabbing but without the map. Despite this I felt that there was much more of a game here. The game makes me want to play more which is a good thing because I feel it would take many plays to properly get the hang of it (or maybe that's just me and my lack of playing negotiation games). High player counts are a must though for the full experience.

Review Date: May 2017

Disclaimers for context:I play with all the expansions added 

Positives: Simple to learn. No 2 games the same. The depth of play and alien races are incredible. Very aggressive gamestyle (might be a negative for you)

Negatives:  Some aliens are too bizarre and are hard to understand for new players. Very aggressive gamestyle (might be a positive for you)

Conclusion: Crazy and unpredictable. Social and the epitome of in your face gaming. If you have 4 or 5 players and want to get random and aggressive, cosmic is for you.

Score 8 if you can handle the knocks!

I don't know what it is about this game but I obsessed over it half a year before I ever even played it. 

There's something about this game that really connects with me. The combination of theme, tone, game play and aesthetics make for a very rewarding experience. 

I love the beautiful illustrations, the huge variety of play combinations, and how so much of the responsibility for the game's balance is placed in the hands of the players.

RATING: 10
My all-time favorite game. Cosmic Encounter plays like a social game, but offers surprising strategic depth when played with experienced CE gamers. I always feel like I have chance in CE, regardless of my alien, but the general wackiness of the powers, flares, and the card draw prevents me (and I suspect others as well) from feeling 'too' invested in winning. This makes the game feel refreshing and fun, despite the fact that I'm constantly thinking through alien power combinations and my choices.

The only downside to CE is that it can be difficult to teach. My wife looks at the wall of text on her Alien Sheet and just shuts down. I didn't have this problem with my first game group, but it's proving to be a challenge with my second.

Still, 10 from me.

Throw traditional ideas about gameplay out the window - aside from the basic structure (simple skeleton and the most asymetrical starts in boardgaming), CE is ALL METAGAME.

Great game, if you like to talk. If not, you'll probably not like it.

One of the very best boardgames I've ever played - though to be fair that's still a number less than 50. No game is ever the same, always some new interesting way to make things happen, something new to react to and something to plot.

It does require at least 4 players to be enjoyable, but makes up for it by basically including every player in every round, so usualy you do not feel like you have nothing to do if you scale the game to include more players (with expansions it allows for up to 8). 5 or 6 is probably the golden number.

Highly entertaining in every aspect. Though I can see how some people might get hung up by the rules not always being clear cut.

If you like games with different powers for different players, then this is the game for you. There are tons of aliens to choose from and the replayability is very high. 

This is just fun to play, where you attack other players to try to establish five colonies on their planets. The attacker/defender have the possibility to invite the other players to support them.

Cosmic Encounter is a hand management card game where you have to know when to play your best cards. Sometimes you will be lucky and have great cards, other times your cards sucks. You have to make the best of it, it is as simple as that.

My gaming group loves this one!

I love the player involvement and interaction in this game. It is easy to teach to new people (at least to people into boardgames; Don't know it it would take off as fast with non-gamers), doesn't take too long and keeps you playing throughout everyone's turn. It motivates people to get creative, which I personally like but I could see this being offputting for other people. The more players, the better I think, because that means more interaction and more oppertunities for creating aliances or betrail.

I really like that the cards decide who you attack, so it's really not possible to gang up on someone too badly.  The alliances are neat, and can be quite fun. I like when two players are in an encounter and both have artifacts or reinforcements they can play after the attack, it makes it really intense.  Both times I've played, I've immediately wanted to play again, this game is good. Unfortunately, my group doesn't feel the same way.

RATING: 7.5
Love the concept, but we played a game which basically rendered the game won after a person got 2 flare cards & his character power.  The rest of the group couldn't do anything because he controlled cards.   Don't like that aspect of the game.

Probably one of the best games ever made. A game this old that has stuck around and been refined into this infinitely entertaining simple game of war.... with a LOT more rules is one you should own. I have one of the expansions (I don't remember which one, it has artifacts and the Deuce) but I love this game. The destiny deck picks who you have to face and you can always negotiate!! (or lie!!) SO much goodness packed into one game. The very definition of classic.

Cosmic Encounter is the game that made me think about the question: what makes a game good? The mechanics? The interactions with other players? The amount of laughter it can produce? The satisfaction when you see your well-thought out strategy come into motion? This game made me separate games into two different categories: games that give me a 'silent satisfaction', and I want to let my brain burn on a big strategic puzzle ('euro's', mostly) and games that give me memorable, awesome experiences that me and my friends will still talk about after some time has passed (Shadows over Camelot, party games). Cosmic Encounters falls into the second category, and is mechanically most definitely not the best game around (basically, your turn comes down on playing a card against your opponent), but when looking at the experiences it provides, there's no other game I've ever played that can beat it. That awesome moment when you play your Attack 40 to win your 5th planet while none of the other players can do something about it is AWESOME (talking from experience. Twice.). Therefore, it's a game that I most likely won't turn down when you ask me to play it. Awesomeness in a box: that's Cosmic Encounter. I 'only' give it a 7,5 because, as I said, mechanically it's not the best game around: the aliens are inbalanced (1 Mobius Tubes and Masochist is screwed), there are some ruling issues (some interactions between cards and aliens are just not explained), it's highly group-dependant and you never know how long the game is gonna take: it could be within half an hour up to over 2 hours. Also, a bad first game definitely turns off people.

It's a classic but it holds up so well no matter how much time has passed. The social combat system works great. The incredible amount of replayability and amazing interactions between races make this a true stand out game for me.

RATING: 7.5
"A game of infinite possibilities" certainly rings true here. I love any game where 3+ players can get involved in a counter war: "I zap your flare - I zap your zap - I zap the zap that zapped his zap!".

My wife thinks this one brings out the testosterone with all the dealing and fighting and she'd rather avoid it. I guess she's right that it can become something of a bear pit.

There is nothing about this game I do not like. Playing with three is fun, but to be utilised to its maximum fun-playing potential four or five is a prerequisite. The game playing dynamic does not allow for players to wimp out when it is their turn, so one is always aware of how tactically demanding this science fiction adventure makes one measure up their options.

Ages ago Scott Nicholson's video review made me break down and buy this, and even with infrequent play, I don't regret it. This is a gem of a game. The various ingenious ways with which the Aliens break the basic game rules, are simply outstanding. They make for such a fun play experience, because you never know what to expect.

The negotiations, powers, and tons, and tons of cards make this such a funny experience. I am eagerly awaiting more opportunities to play.

The definitive ameritrash way. It has everything a great ameritrash game have and none of the weakness. It's chaotic, crazy, funny, huuge variety, backstabbing, wheelin' dealin', card battles, foiling rival plan, sneaking up from behind, trash talking, intimidation, bluffing, cool minis, EVERYTHING

RATING: 7
I had to decrease my rating of this game on the basis that we got a few games that were not that fun to experience due to bad Alien combinations. Because of that my group is less eager to play the game again.
Otherwise, great party game with no downtime. Really cool mechanisms, cool social interaction, cool aliens and cards. Its only weakness is its target audience. Not everybody feels confortable playing a negociation game like CE. Also, card hoarding wins games. A few aliens are not fun at all to play. Other than that an amazing and unique game. It really requires 6 players to really shine, though, which I find hard to achieve nowadays. I don't give it a higher rating on the basis that a small % of the games will inevitably be broken, because of some combo emerging that kills the game completely or makes it very unfair.

I was pretty enamoured with this game before I played it and it didn't disappoint when I got the chance!  The cards "choosing" your target often left more choices than I expected and the negotiations and temporary alliances around the table are a lot of fun.  It is a pretty random game, but those who manage the chaos best and have some skill at bluffing tend to do better... sometimes.

Great prodution, FFG really did a bang up job visually with this updated version of Cosmic Encounter.  The gameplay seems to remain mostly the same, I guess you probably won't see much differences unless you play it a lot with the new races/powers.  I wasn't too impressed by the original, so I only bumped it up by half a point to reflect the top-notch production value.

This is the pinnacle of variety. Every game is different, and I'm discovering new ways to play each and every time I play it. When I pull it out for new people, they pick up on it very quickly, and always ask for a second play after the first.

I quickly bought all the expansions to this, as it added significant variety to the game through new and innovative aliens in addition to additional cards such as the rewards and hazards deck.

RATING: 10
Best mix of party-type gaming with tactical gaming.  
You will laugh and laugh and laugh at the inter-player politics, but you'll often find yourself thinking about how you can make an encounter work to your advantage.  The FF version has so much character in its presentation that you almost role-play the alien species you are given.
Also, a HUGE bonus to this game is that there is NO down time.  Even with 6 players (i haven't played with more, but i don't see it being any different) everyone was talking, interacting, and even intently watching (when they might not even have any stakes in the current encounter).  No one ever had their phone out, or left the room.  We all were playing ALL the time.
I've played with only new groups (new to this game, that is) of people, and, while some were a bit lost during the first round of the game, all of them enjoyed it and wanted to play a second game immediately after finishing their first.  There is a reason why this game has been around for so long.  It's a fantastic design that is hard to beat.

Good update of the classic. Nothing changed rulewise, but production values are in good shape although a bit overpriced. (5 players: check / Kazillion of aliens: check / Flares: check / Technology: check / Good art: check / Tons of bits that you don't need but in a few games out of 100: check, although mainly card board, and not really a tons of bits but still a few.. hmm now that I think of, this one fails.. and this gives the overpriced stamp on the game, you really should see more stuff inside 60e game's box) Gameplay rocks: simple rules, fun to play. This one gives you those all warming cosmic grooves.

update: summer 2010, game has been nicknamed by one of my friends and I concur: it's no more cosmic encounter, its FUCKING AWESOMENESS!

Hmm. This is a bit of a headscratcher. Cosmic was a personal grail game for a while--it kept cropping up as the no. 1 game on places like Sit Down & Shut Up and Rock Paper Shotgun, but was out of stock locally everywhere for a couple of months. When I finally got hold of it I was sure it would be a big hit... yet nobody I've played it with (about eight people, in three different groups) has been especially taken with it. 

I still have hope that it will grow on us, though. The same way Wiz-War did. The trouble is, we now have plenty of other games to play, so Cosmic doesn't come out often enough to get a chance to shine. I went ahead and picked up the expansions regardless, out of possibly misplaced optimism...

I friggin' love Cosmic. We've played this a lot, usually with 5-6 people but sometimes as many as 8 (since Cosmic Alliance). It's relatively simple, somewhat fast to play and extremely replayable what with the humongous stack of Aliens to pick from. Usually people want to go again as soon as it's over. I think my only problem with the game is more of an issue with the players because even though I've repeatedly told them that inviting to attack and defend is supposed to be a considered decision, everyone still basically auto-invites everyone every time which leads to somewhat dumb games sometimes. Oh well, still adore Cosmic.

Every single time I´ve played this game has been awesome. It has the right amount of strategy and luck to make it a deep and fun experience. The layout of the game always attract new people to the table and the large amount of aliens and cards assure that no experience will always be the same. Also, the fact that this game supports many players makes this game appear on our table quite often.

Cosmic encounter is another one of those games that does well when there is a healthy level of negotiation going on. You need to get 5 colonies set up, but the cards make it so that you’re going to have a really hard time doing so unless you’re exploiting your race’s power properly and working well with the table. It felt like the game got very stagnant as soon as someone hit 4 colonies, but I’m not sure if we were playing with all the correct rules. I would play this again just to explore the different strategies offered by the various races.

It is incredible easy to learn, bridges different types of players and is - pure and simple - fun to play.

What really makes a difference to so many games out there:

- there is no "downtime" during other players turns.
- it is fairly short, but still long enough to "matter".
- you can always turn the game around and win.
- it is very interactive.

Bluffing, calculating, guessing and overall lot of fun to play. Rules of the game change each time. There is no downtime between turns, since you can always be asked to participate in combat as an ally. Some negative points for the bookkeeping when you have a lot of flares or artefacts (cards with lot of text on it) and being dealt a powerful alien on whom everyone gangs up. This leads to a certain amount of kingmaker problems. 

It's still a recommendation for every game collection since it's easy to setup, teach, play and interactive. It has it's memorable moments and also has a great variety.

A classic that never gets old, even after hundreds of play.

Caveat to "always want to play"--with the right group. While this is true for most games, this is one of the most finicky. Players who strongly prefer low-lucky high-strategy games will be put off by the random draws and power imbalances among aliens. Players who can't stand take-that mechanics, which I'm not a huge fan of myself, might be put off by it. 

Personally, it works because the take-that isn't too strong, most of the luck you can mitigate with smart hand management and by being a smooth negotiator. I suggest throwing small amounts of money ($1-5 per player) each game, with the winner(s) splitting the pot to maximize end-game shenanigans if you think your group can handle that without bad blood. The game is quite good without that addition, but in my experience lends itself toward shared victories.

It's a classic, but....
And the sheer number of races means you'll never see the same game twice.  Ever.
However, there isn't as much actual 'game' here as I'd like. It essentially boils down to 'draw a card, attack that player'. The game comes from exactly how you should attack, what card to play, should you make a deal etc, but I would prefer it if it had a touch more depth.

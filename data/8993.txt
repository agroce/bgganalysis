GAME: Fire in the East
RANK: 2883
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Europa system is very great. Yes, Fire in the east is a monster, but some scenario in the Europa magazine allow some short games (Leningrad 1941, Lunch at Stalingrad, Kiev 1943, etc...). I'm a fan of three such scenarios on the Finnish Front: Continuation war (1941), summer war (1944) and Polar Fuchs (1944)

Wished I had the time/space for this monster game.  Never yet managed to play beyond turn 3.  Would love just once to see what happens when winter starts to bite.  Suffers from the general Europa malady of spending time lovingly preparing and resolving air missions only to see them be largely ineffectual.

The neglect this game receives at BGG just helps to illustrate that too many gamers think with their "wrists," a la Axis & Allies, Battle Cry, etc., rather than their brains.

This game is quite playable.  The rules are not difficult, but the effort comes in mastering their quantity.  The ground rules are the easiest to learn, given that the basic concepts have been around for forty plus/minus years, give or take a hundred.  There is not much in the way of naval rules unless you are planning to put the Bismarck on wheels.  This leaves the air rules and oy! they come in spades and then some.  

If you have the time and the space, Fire in the East and Scorched Earth are well worth the effort if you want a serious simulation study.  There are some questions of play balance (will these be addressed in "Total War"?), as the Axis side is hard pressed to come close to repeating the historical results of Barbarossa.

If you want a better balance between realism and playability, without sacrificing either, go with GMT's Army Group series.

I've played this game on a monthly basis for over a decade. I really like the way the game tackles the subject. The Germans will outrun their supply lines, the Panzers will separate from the infantry and the Soviets will get their chance. The way the game is balanced with benefits from armour, engineers, winterized troops, air power, etc. makes it one of my favorites. The rules are a bit complex, but I like that, and combined with the task ahead it makes for a real challenge, especially when playing the Germans. I always play the game in the extended form with Scorched Earth, to provide for the full campaign and the full experience. Can't get enough of this one!

For me this is one of the best games I have ever played.  It has a great immersion feel.  As the German player you have to constantly worry about your supply lines and manage your armoured advances.  You need to make sure you have enough combat engineers to repair broken rail lines as well as take cities.  Air power need to be managed so as to not waste any resources, you must capture or build air bases to keep the troops covered. etc etc.  Same on the Soviet side.  Seeing what you think is a solid line sliced through by German tanks is something to see.  But you have the ability to rebuild your lines with reinforcements.  

The down side to this game is that it takes months to play, but if you are a student of the Eastern Front, this game is a must play at least once in your life.

I've played this one twice and been thoroughly trashed each time. Once, as the Axis player, I managed to lose Bucharest and Konigsberg to the Soviet counter-attacks of Fall 1941... I'd play it again but only as part of a team, so as not to hurt my side's cause too much.

For twenty-five years and still counting, the definitive game on WWII Eastern Front, to my mind.  Nothing else effectively captures the scope and immensity of this theater.  While newer systems tout all sorts of clever toys, none of them (I'm looking at you, Red Star Rising) do as good a job of faithfully, realistically capturing the proper pace and lethality of the conflict, particularly in the first year.

Fine for its day, but now an outdated system...It has always needed more turns. The designers ultimately forgot that it was an Operational-level ground game. The Air and supply point system has gotten completely out of hand and delivers poor results.

RATING: 9.5
Now if you really want to play Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union in WW2, but I mean really, really, down to the last ski-batallion and anti-aircraft battery (and who wouldn't!) than this is your game!

And with a remarkably efficient system for the integration of air and ground forces. As there was never any strategic bombing on the Eastern front, the air forces can concentrate on doing what they're good at, helping the troops.
The naval system, the poor relative in the system, is only slightly visible in the Baltic and Black Seas, where it is easily ignored.

I still would love to try the partisans one day. There is so much to this game, I keep coming back to it.
You can read several play-throughs on the Wb-Grognards, take care as Axis player to eliminate enough Soviet units every turn or you'll soon find yourself overwhelmed.

Many an hour spent with this game and Unentscheiden, beers, and friends. I used to think that it was a German lock, but a friend figured a better way to approach Russian-ness and suddenly this became an even struggle. We've slogged through most of '43, but have never gotten to '44. Just as well I suppose.

The premier game in the EUROPA series and while others will say that the system has been superseded, there is just no other game with this kind of detail all-around, despite the few flaws in it.  Will likely hold that position as the ultimate East Front monstergame until TOTAL WAR, intended to replace it, has been published.

The mega-beastie classic of Operation Barbarossa on a divisional scale. Anyone who says this game takes 360 minutes to play never had to set it up. But, as with all Europa "chit city" classics, it's one that will stand the test of time.

This is probably the ultimate team game. You can easily have four players on the german side alone (north, centre, south and luftwaffe etc.) and believe me you will soon find out what those conflicts in the high command were all about! Personally I think this is the only game where the Europa system really comes into its own (perhaps Western Desert too) since the general complexity of the rules favor a large scale. Don't let the size of the game as such be a deterrant, once you get into it it's actually a very fast paced and dynamic game. Fire in the East is definitely on my top five.

A wonderful game that covers the grand sweep of the 1941 campaign.  Using your basic Europa rules with some chrome the game moves along.  The scale is big enough that it works great for team play, but is also not too large for single one-on-one play.  The maps are nice and clear, with GDW's traditional clearly printed counters.

Super heavy-weight game on the Eastern front on German divisions vs. Soviet corps.  I wonder how many gamers out there actually play it half way or even to completion?

I am now (Aug 2011) playing it for the sixth time. My first was in '88 and I loved it then. This is a playable monster in all its glory. After playing Clash of Arms' Struggle for Europe system, I will be adding some leadership rules and some modified supply rules to reflect more accurately the surrender of large pockets of troops. Other than that, it's old Europa as usual.

30 years after being printed this game, were I to set this one up now, gamers would appear out of the woodwork! The game, with its alternating turn structure, makes an excellent team game with something for all players. Yes the Germans are all-powerful, however the Soviets do have some teeth! The challenge is in force preservation prior to winter so that an effective winter assault can be launched. One of the most played games in my collection.

Break out the pool or ping-pong table AND cover it up with the maps from this game!  A monster.  GDW Europa's finest game of the series.  Feels like you are in a top level HQ moving units across the map... massive in its scope!  Army groups are the real deal with this game.  I give Fall of France a higher rating than this game only because from a physical component stand point it is more manageable than Fire in the East, requiring less space for charts, tables, etc.  Also, the set up time for this game can take a weekend before you even start the first turn!

I played Fire in the East during a week. No life! My partner played German and me the feeble Russian. June 1941 my infantry divisions shaded a curtain of gun’s flesh. The Panzer Korps vaporized my soldiers like a tear drop on the fire! Harsh play for a great game! My moral swings up and down, a boat on a furious ocean. Sincerely Fire in the East is a serious experiment. Nerves and blood sessions. Excellent game for grognards exclusively.

THE one and only.
The only monster I played more than once and enjoyed more and more.
Some people don't like the rules, I did. The game mechanics are nice for armoured spearheads and the air-units are really involved in the game. The debate about wether it is realistic to commit bomber and fighter units to a specific ground attack, when 1 turn is 2 weeks, might be interesting. Still I found the system working out well. 
The sheer size of the maps although has banned the game to the shelf, probably for the rest of my life.. but I'll be back! ;-)

The 10 is more a sentimental rating for the fun time I had playing it. Today it is somewhat outdated. I think I would rate it a 6 or 7. It only the serious minded should play it. I played it with a friend and it took us ten year to get from June II 41 to December II 43. But this was part time playing. However, I did enjoy playing it. I think I liked the air battles the best. In past games I would use the tactic (before the rules changed) of Stalin's Angels putting motorcycle troops on river units, sailing down rivers behind German line, dropping them off to tear up airfields and etc. Go with Eastfront,Russian Front or Campaign,& especially No Retreat for a quicker game.

RATING: 7
Huge Europa game of the invasion of Russia in '41, or maybe even a little earlier. Standard second generation Europa treatment, good clear maps, a mountain of counters in the Europa colors and style, and the rules that eventually become imprinted on the frontal cortex of the dedicated Europa fanatic's brain. I was once able to lay this game out on a 4'x8' table - it took a day to cut out the counters and another day to set up the scenario. Four months later, averaging about three weekends a month, I'd managed to play 27 turns into the campaign. At that point, I had to pack up the game to move to another town. I feel that qualifies as a play, and I certainly knew the system by then.

Exceptional game with tremendous detail.  Multi-layered campaign with air and land interwoven. Timescale and air system are pushed to limit. Strictly historical air and land reinforcements limit exploration of campaign possibilities.  Rules are not over complicated.  Nice affect is it is important on how you construct and group your formations.  Logistics is very important. Great chrome for scale and topic. Always provokes endless conversations about game play and strategy. Russian Army does not commit useless attacks, Germans maneuver and pound away. Terrain on the maps is a wonder to behold. Love this gem.

I've owned this game for many years. Actually completed the full campaign only a few times. (Though I have played it's companion Scorched Earth many times well past the ending point of FitE.) But I've played many games well into the winter of 41-42. Most of those were stopped when it was clear one side or the other was not going to win.

I think it can be well balanced if the players have comparable talent
  
One of my most interesting games was against a German who had almost no experience with wargames, but extensive historical knowledge of the actual campaign. He began the game convinced that Germany never had a chance to win in the actual war. And then he won! He finished convinced that Hitler costs Germany a war. 

The game did take almost an entire year to play though!

We got much faster over many replays.

Good looking. Great feeling. Takes an eternity. After a 20 year hiatus in playing this in a group session, we hid away in a cabin for five days. We played the 1942 scenario and managed to play some 12 turns in five days!!! Admittedly at least one in the group was a little bit slow. The game is solid in portraying the immensity of the conflict as you do get overburdened with units, especially midgets. The mechanism has that 1970's feel, it was good at the time but could certainly have been better. Fun? It depends. Fun as an exercise in shuffling huge amounts of units, not fun as in playing a fluid and fast game. Our conclusion was that the game is more WWI than WWII. So, why 8.5?  Because it is titan of the past, visually attractive and a game you will remember to have played.

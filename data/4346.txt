GBACW system. Good intro game to the system with one map and low counter density. Small scale meeting engagment that turns into a larger toe to toe fight. Reminds me of all the was good about the old SPI.

A scenario of the right size for the GBACW serie. Fun but very unbalanced - it needs house rules to help the Union having a chance.

One of the best games of this series, since I think that the small scale makes the game system easier to handle; and it is a very interesting system.

I was the developer on this game and I am very proud of it. As designed, the game began as a set-piece battle, my main contribution was to move the time of game start back so that the Confederates had to enter the map, making it more of a meeting engagement. Also, I cut out or simplified virtually all special rules thus making this the easiest of all the games in the series to get up and running. It is a tense, short, and fun game.

RATING: 2
Huge rules overhead, but perhaps not huge enough.  Game desperately needs artillery ammunition limitation or some other disincentive to prevent players serially lobbing multiple pot shots at one another, wasting endless time.  If waste it was, because this sniping is just too effective to eschew.  Not a viable tactic in any other battle in the system, so something's wrong somewhere.

Beyond this, a superb graphic presentation, amongst the best in the series.  An awful situation for the boys in blue; it appears a large skill differential between the players is needed to balance this one.

It is the game of the serie that we played the most.
It is short and fun. There are no problems with the rules and we can focus on the game.
results were one marginal victory for the grey,one marginal victory for the blue,one strategic victory for the grey.

An extremely playable game, drawn from the legendary GBACW system. Dave and I played this 4/5 times in the 90's and it ranks in our all time top 5 games to play from the SPI generation.I always played the Yankees to appease Dave's Confederate bloodlust! Very much like the ranged and melee combat rules and the line of march/deployment system is strong and realistic. One of the classics and should be on your '100 games to play before you die' list.

This is an all time classic. If you like GBACW this is one of the founding episodes in that legend. Of course this is part of the earlier incarnation so is IGO/UGO unlike the later chit pull versions. I like it anyway and this is a small, tense, well balanced situation. A lot of fun.

SPI's Terrible Swift Sword/Great Battles of the American Civil War system just never appealed to me, although I've only played the smaller games that were published in S&T magazine. I found the game system to be more trouble than it was worth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Very good game. The older GBACW system is a bit creaky at the edges and tiresome to play in long bouts--I recently tried a game of TSS after a 15 year hiatus and got bored. But in a smaller format, it's still very fun and playable! A highly recommended battle, with swings of advantage: the Union comes on strong at first and must crush the Rebels early, lest the reinforcements come in and knock them out. Plays a bit like other classic battles in that regard -- Battle of the Bulge, Operation Saturn (AVL), any Pacific War type thing, etc.

RATING: 9
Great game - and I agree it might be the best in the system after TSS. Fun, tense, and exciting - SPI and Company got it right on the money this time!  

As time passes, I become more enamored of this game. It works very well, presents challenges for both players, and is an exciting presentation. This and Pea Ridge are the jewels of the GBACW system.

A pleasant surprise from the magazine: a mini TSS system battle. I've always thought that the system worked better with smaller battles and this game would seem to support me. An early Stonewall Jackson affair where he has numbers as well as quality on his side. Components are standard for a TSS style game, and the map, though only a little bigger than a folio series map, is clear enough. A tough fight for both sides, with inconveniently placed creeks and a thick circle of woods that are just waiting to trap carelessly handled units. Good fun.

This game has serious staying power. Simple, yet
provides an interesting puzzle, with enough variance
(from the optional random rules) to shake things up.

An intriguing game when it first was published, but time and the state of the art have long since passed it by.  The game came down to dice rolling, particularly for the Soviet player, to break through Finnish defenses.  Other games on the topic are much better.  The only reason to play this title now is out of sheer nostalgia, for those of us who remember the day when this game got published.

Played it in 1972. Still play it once in a while. I enjoy the game and having lived in the sub-artic in 1980's gave me a whole new perspective on this one.Have often thought of attempting to expand it into the 2nd Russo-Finnish War (1941-1945).

Winter War is a fast and furious game that while not a hyper accurate simulation, will provide a player with an understanding of the Soviet invasion of Finland in a quick playing game. Winter War has stood the test time because it is playable, features events, has variable deployment options, and the map has an evocative quality.

I played this for the first time about a year or so ago. Very tense situation. The one significant flaw in the game is the breaching of the Mannerheim line overly luck dependent.  However, the game plays quickly enough, that I'm willing to put up with the fact that sometimes the Soviets won't have a chane of winning due to a few die rolls.

RATING: 8
Played (solo) for the first time since 1975(!), and it still cuts it as a simpl(ish) wargame. Not too many units, asynchronous sides (the challenge facing the Russians is very different from that facing the Finns without there being a ton of special rules to make this so) and reasonably short play time. 

Checking Russian supply can be a bit of a faff, otherwise pretty smooth game on an unusual but interesting David vs. Goliath struggle.
----------------
Got in a face to face game, which I lost on the last Russian attack die roll - right down to the wire!

Amazingly good game for its vintage (and pretty darn good regardless of its age), although using one of the play balance options to give the Russian a fighting chance is recommended
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Not a bad game for beginners. Quick to learn rules with not a lot of complex procedures.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Elegant example of a  great S &T game, the game abstracts factors like supply and doctrine with simple rules like stacking. Most of the random events can make it very diffilcult for the Soviets, recommend trying it straight up, with out the random events first time.

An interesting game of the Russo-Finnish Winter War. There are two fronts, one by Leningrad and the other in Karelia.  Around Leningrad, the Finns and Soviets clash hard and do not make much headway - though the Soviets have overpowering forces.  In the North everything is more fluid and it's quite fun.  This is a simple game, but it does take a while to play.  I haven't played in a long time, but I can see myself returning.

RATING: 10
I'm a bit of a Winter War enthusiast.  Lots of replayability with the events table and the other variants floating around.
A few reasons it's worth a try if you like the subject:

*4 page rulebook (with very little errata)
*Plays in roughly two hours
*Almost no counter stacking 
*Great map
*Fun to play from both sides (Asymmetrical)
*Play with or without the Events

would love to see a reprint with larger map and counters.

I hijacked my plotter printer at work and enlarged the map.

The game itself is pretty good, even if a bit pro-Fin.

Just acquired.  I was always interested in this topic.
Update: Finally pulled this one off the shelf.  Can't see how the Soviets can possibly win.  The Finns are virtually indestructible in their fortifications.  The requirement that the Soviets must attack all adjacent Finnish units makes it impossible to crack the Mannerheim line.  And the modified CRT for Finnish units in forts causes Soviet exchanges/eliminations.  Finns capture Leningrad every time.

An excellent game, especially for its day.  Pretty simple rules with quite disparate force capabilities.  Very much a game of cat and mouse, so won't appeal to everyone.  With competent play, should come down to dice rolls on the Mannerheim line.  Traded.

Interesting game.  Lots of Russian troops were sent to the mincer to get a marginal victory.
Small rules overhead, but it does a great job of giving a feel for the campaign.

RATING: 7.5
SPI's early operational treatment of the Winter War. Counters and map look like early '70s, so no beauty points here. A mere four pages of rules, so there isn't much to confuse a player. The game looks like the historical mismatch that it appeared to be in 1939, with a huge Russian army poised to roll over the Finnish battalions. Some interesting rules, however, restore some balance to the situation. Finns can practically ignore ZOCs, and supply rules, while the Russians the must attack any enemy unit they are next to, and must constantly keep their supply lines protected. One of the better games to come out of the early SPI.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
Asymmetric combat rules and terrain utility give the Finns a chance that is not evident by counting rifles. Multiple solo plays. Found some fun tricks to give the Russians a chance, but still not a terribly good chance. Play with the random events enabled, this is a lot more fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Oversized, homemade edition. I like the bleak depiction of the geography, but I'm not such a fan of the way a constant need to trace supply in a couple of different ways makes the movement phase such a chore for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.1
Excellent subtle rules set.  Nothing earth-shattering in the rules, but the differences in rules for Soviets and Finns makes for a unique asymmetrical system.  Nail-biting at times.

A classic that I would dream about when looking at the SPI catalogue as a child.  Not easy to find.

Quite fun to play for the first 2-3 times. But then you start to realize that the game offers few meaningful operational choices and that the end result depends primarily on a couple of die rolls - namely the results of the critical Mannerheim line battles.

I probably only want this because of Nick Palmer's wargaming book.

An obscure yet interesting little corner of World War 2, though.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Arguably the best of the original S&T games, this actually holds up pretty well.

It's really two games in one: the standard game tends to produce a historical result (USSR eventually grinds out a win), while adding the variant political events tends to strongly favor the Finns.

Play the standard game first.  There's a fair amount to explore in it.  It's not a game where the Soviets can afford to be sloppy -- they will lose.

One of the better simple titles out of early S&T, based on the USSR aggression against Finland prior to Germany's campaign against the Soviets. The Finns held out historically against seemingly overwhelming odds, and the game is an enjoyable effort to reproduce the feel of the brief war. Finland was the only country invaded by the USSR during this period that got a negotiated peace because of their steadfast defense.

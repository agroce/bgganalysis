RATING: 7
After 10 plays, I bumped this up to 9.  This game is really a great, tight 2 player game.  The rules are so simple, but  there are really so many options, and so much interaction, that every game we play seems different. 

I love how the score can change so dramatically during the game.  You gain 5, you lose 4.  You never know who will win until the end.  Fantastic.

RATING: 6
Economic building game with multiple ways to score.  Theme doesn't necessarily have anything to do with "Settlers of Catan"- probably just a marketing ploy.

This game involves trying to be the first to score 10 points, accomplished through: a) building walls, b) building the church, c) building buildings, and d) trading with ports.  To do this, you will need gold and influence cards, which are generally obtained through resource collection from dice rolls.  There's even a pirate on a "7" roll.  While all of this sounds like Settlers of Catan, it's actually a very different game in practice.  By different, I mean more strategic, and more "dirty".  

Dice rolls can never be repeated, pirates are much more forgiving, buildings can be built over (similar to Drunter & Druber and thus points are lost, similar to Lowenherz), and the play area is quite tight, regardless of the number of players.  This game also scales very well from 2-4 players.  It actually would've been nice if this game was marketed on its own merit, rather than trying to tie it in to the Catan series.  Either way, it's a solid game for those that like strategic conflict games with just a slight touch of luck.

Elasund is a really fun game. 
It isn't like Settlers. It is a city building game where each player competes to build bigger and better buildings than the others, gaining victory points.

RATING: 5
The game is not as good as Settlers of Catan (by the same designer). It is far more competitive and it is possible to be set back to a position (due to mistakes or most of all bad luck) where you cannot do much to change the game for yourself. The mechanics of the game is well thought out, but luck just play too high a factor for me at least. Rolling the dice is a path to success or doom and it feels like the dice actually determine a players status much more in this game than in Settlers for instance.

Juego poco popular pero muy interesante. Buen precio en su versión alemana para la calidad de sus componentes. Muy válido para 2 á 4 jugadores. No apto para parejas, juego de puteo constante, con muchas posibilidades tácticas a lo largo de la partida. Se trata básicamente de buscar huecos en el tablero donde construir edificios, pudiendo destruir los del oponente. Jugarretas sucias y maniobras elegantes por igual. Fácil de explicar pero complejo de asimilar una vez metido en el juego. Cuanto más lo juego más me gusta.

Elasund is just too much like Catan really. Instead of a board made of hexagonal tiles that you roll die to see what resources you get, you play on a grid board where you roll dice to see what resources you get. Instead of having the robber when you roll a 7, you have pirates. Instead of building cities, you are building buildings. This thing is just a variant of Settlers of Catan in all honestly. So why is it here?

{1 play • 4 player} Okay, our first game went very long, 2+ hours... but I liked it.  A lot of nice things going on here - and far more diplomacy than normal Settlers - while still feeling like Settlers.  I'd rate it higher, but I wasn't thrilled that players can actually lose VPs in the game, espcially since, bad un-Settlers-like feelings aside, this also makes the game take longer.  In fact, if becoming more familiar with the game doesn't reduce play time by a good margin, my rating will definitely drop.  That said, I like the placement of the contracts mechanism, and the ability to use your cards to mitigate "unfortunate" dice.  You can do your own thing, like regualr Settlers, but you can also form mini alliances - cool stuff.

RATING: 1.5
In my personal dictionary, under the term Love-Hate, there's a picture of Elasund. I happen to be quite good at this game, but I don't actually like to play it. A friend of mine loves Elasund, and she likes to play it with me, but I have to kind of force myself to get into the game just to make her happy. 

On rare occasions, there's a mind-blowing moment of "whoa, this is fantastically intricate, look at all the colors, errr, tiles, errr, possibilities!" which I imagine is similar to being high on magic mushrooms, or seeing the sliced insides of a human being as shown by a CT scanner. Then the moment passes, and I realize I'm still playing the game of "replace someone else's tiles with yours." It's tedious and painful. But intriguing too. 

I don't even know how to rate Elasund. It's a very interesting concept, for sure, and definitely a very brainy game. It's just not actually *fun*.

Another addition to Catan games, this one is fcused on building.  While the scoring is based on points, game play is more similar to an area influence style game.  The game can take a long time, expecially with new players, but is very tight.  There is more option for startegic play and there is no negotiation / trading.  An enjoyable game that maintains a common feel with its heritage.  It is better than Candamir and more challenging than Settlers of Catan.  A worthy game, but not for everyone.  [GTI: TGCD]

The best Catan game for my money.  Starfarers at times proves more engaging but drags on and doesn't manage to keep the intensity throughout, something Elasund does well. Similar to Settlers and its derivatives only in the presence of 2 die and that Elasund is also a resource management game, Elasund provides more tools to mitigate the luck.  Of course, luck still drives the game as an important element, but Teuber erred on the right side here, whereas Settlers dwells on the line too often.

I truly enjoy the strategic maturation of the game as it progresses.  Teuber elegantly avoided the repetition that plagues game such as Caylus where the basic options on a turn vary only incrementally throughout the hour and a half running time.  Not without its flaws, Elasund, like most Teuber designs, seems to plateau quickly in depth and therefore luck takes over as the primary determinate in who wins.

RATING: 6
1 play.  Initial impression = annoyed.  In hindsight, I think I felt annoyed because I didn't understand enough about the game mechanics until it was too late... then the game dragged on for a 3rd hour until we finally had a lucky winner.  I spent too much time worried about losing cards for having my cubes on big buildings on the board... this is not a legitimate reason to avoid placing larger buildings.  Much like regular Catan, this game is all about picking on the leader... and unlike regular Catan, this game provides sufficient means to attack an opponent's position.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Settlers is a game I really don't need to play ever again, but I keep it around because people seem to like it.  Having gone through so many variations of the core mechanic that just feel like more of the same with a rule tweek here or there, its great to see a game that uses the core mechanic of rolling for production and moving a pirate, but which takes the series in a brand new direction.  An awesome game, maybe not for non-gamers, but a lot of fun with several approaches to winning, and a lot of direct confrontation and treachery.  Not especially heavy once you get a couple turns under your belt, but not as simple as regular Catan either.  Highly recommended, I can see playing Elasund for a long time to come.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Another great game from Klaus Teuber. Despite being part of the Catan brand, it shares very few traits with Settlers. This is a downright nasty devious game. I love it. Can be quite a long game, but no worse than Cities & Knights or Starfarers. Lacks the setup variety of other Catan games, but it doesn't matter, there are plenty of ways to get your victory cubes on the board, and plenty of ways to ruin the progress of others.

For my tastes Elasund takes a step in the right direction within this series of titles.  I gave it the same initial rating I dished out for Starfarers--my previous favorite in the Catan family, but I would pick Elasund as my new first choice between them.  Compared to the original Settlers, it's "goodbye pointless trading; hello player confrontation."  This would absolutely appease your inner zoning board commissioner, yearning to chap the hides of those who would ruthlessly park a cheap trailer on a nice wooded lot.  Last played 27 Sept. '06 with Michael, Alex and Garrett.

Hay que construir edificios en la ciudad, con el fin de deshacerte de tus puntos de victoria (10). Según lo que construyas, puedes colocar cubos en un lugar u otro, o levantar construcciones de tus contrincantes. Además, se puede construir una iglesia. Eso sí, para construir primero hay que tener permiso de construcción, y puedes utilizar los permisos de los adversarios.
En cada turno, una tirada de dados indica qué fila de la ciudad producirá beneficios a aquellos jugadores que hayan construido algo en dicha fila. Si sale un siete, se putea. Esta ultima mecánica tiene bastantes similitudes con Catán. Es del mismo diseñador, y se nota. 

Es un juego que tiene más de lo que aparenta. A mí me gusta tanto como catán.  Lo adquirí en las CLBSK a Ikarus, aunque tardo en llegar a mis manos tres semanas.

Such a nice game. Tight to the end. Also a game where you can raze your fellow players buildings.

(4 plays) Three two player games against my significant other, one game with four players so far. 

With two players, the game seems to be very well balanced. The mechanics mirror those of "Settlers of Catan" with some minor rules added although playing this game feels very different from "Settlers", and unfortunately there is no direct interaction, something I really like about settlers.

The one play with four was with two players new to the game and it dragged on quite a bit. I hope that next time playing time will be significantly shorter.

Eh, just didn't grab me.  Shares many of Settlers' problems, i.e. if one person gets lucky die rolls early in the game they can grab the most advantageous spots and be almost impossible to catch.  Not a bad game, but there are many others I'd rather play.

A very charming game. I was positively surprised. I've played two and three players. More is better. Maybe 10 points are a bit too few - the game ends before the board gets very tightly crowded. I might try playing to 12 points. Very nice board and tiles, rules suffice.

After 0.5 plays : Game is interesting but in our game (with 3 / 4 new players) there was an ugly early period for one of the new players who tried the Church strategy and ended up getting repeatedly hit by the pirate--not sure whether his position was actually recoverable, but he didn't feel it was (and certainly wasn't having any fun) so the game collapsed.

May be I can increase the rating (or decrease it) after some more plays

UPDATE: after 3 plays I downgraded it from 7 to 6.5; I still think it is not bad but it's too slow and too long; all the 3 games lasted more than 2 hours while its correct lenght should be no more than 1 hour and half

Maybe it's just because I rarely win it, or because (unlike the other Settler games) you can really flip the game in an instant (by building a large building on the waterfront, for instance).  The waterfront adds a lot of tension, as often one person's gain is another's loss - big time!  I like this game, but damn, it raises my blood pressure.

RATING: 4.5
Although I am a huge fan of Settlers, I am becoming not such a huge fan of Klaus Teuber. Rolling for income or resources is all fine and dandy if you can use some of that income/resources to bargain for other things you want. That's what makes Settlers such a fun game. 

When you take the trading away from a game whose sole mechanic is based on chance, you immediately reduce what could be a game rife with player interaction into literally a crap shoot.

For this reason I was not a fan of this game at all. When it's not uncommon to see three actions in a row consist of nothing but "take 2 gold," you know there is something wrong with the game. Echoes of Entdecker here. Not impressed.

UPDATE: One thing that bears mentioning is that this game can be nasty. Comparatively anyway. You're competing by knocking over other players' buildings, and this sort of direct, destructive competition is pretty unusual in a euro, even in comparatively directly competitive games like Quo Vadis. This sort of thing will not appeal to some. But I still think Elasund is very clever and I quite like it.
---
Very nice; a Settlers tile-laying game. It's got the traditional die-rolling elements, with a 2d6 roll that triggers resource payoffs by row on the square grid, but unlike Settlers, Elasund provides you with more direct ways to bend the laws of probability to your will with influence cards. These can be spent to ignore many of the restrictions imposed by the dice. This is then combined with a neat tile-laying game. It's also a surpringly competitive game, with lots of ways to mess with the other players, but as the game goes on things tighten up, space-wise, and so there isn't much of an endgame kingmaking problem. Good stuff. Before I had played Beowulf, this was my pick of Essen, just ahead of Hacienda; reasonably straightforward, nicely thematic, good planning elements, player interaction, and the dice to provide a bit of chaos and the fun factor. With the (revised) Candamir and Elasund, Teuber seems like he's back on a roll.

One additional comment: the rules to Elasund are just a bit involved, and the rules themselves are not completely clear on a couple points. But the examples are wonderful, and clarify everything. It took us a couple times to play entirely correctly, and the game is much better when played entirely correctly :)

Pretty decent variant on the Settlers "roll dice to acquire resources" mechanic.  While it carries the Settlers tag, this mechanic is about the only resemblance to the original.  This isn't really a bad thing though, as it's a decent game in its own right.  Overall, I felt as if the game worked alright and had a few interesting decisions, but really didn't have anything to make it all that exciting.

Considerable planning makes this tile-laying game much heavier and far more vicious than Settlers of Catan.  More strategy and more difficult tactical decisions, too.  I think that people who like Settlers won't enjoy this as much but, people that don't like Settlers may enjoy this much more.

Not nearly as high "game-for-effort" quotient as Settlers, and will not become a Settlers-type classic.  However, much cleaner in design than other Euros have been lately (and certainly less fiddly), and well-stocked with visual aids that help play.  All players in our game were competitive throughout, and the session literally came down to the last round.  Worth playing, may not be worth owning.

More similar to the original than Candamir.  I prefer the simplicity of only having to deal with 2 resources and the match/set of the influence cards.  The board does get a bit too tight towards the end as you try to find space that isn't going to be expensive to develop.

With the exception of the 2d6 distribution of rolls, there is very little to connect this game to Catan. I'd have liked it better without the thematic tie-in, as I'm a little tired of Catan. 

The spatial element was fun, although the game still has a fair amount of luck to it...which detracts from the enjoyment overall, for me. The components are lovely. I'd be willing to play if someone suggested it and was eager. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Inoffensive Catan spinoff, though I'm not sure if there's enough here to make it memorable or worth visiting again.

Take the Settlers "dice rolls produce resources" engine and then combine that with a square grid where players can place buildings that will make them power cards and cash cards. Then mix in a permit system where they have to claim lots that they will later erect buildings on which can produce yet more power and money cards and then VPs as well. Mix in a dash of screw you with the pirate who shows up on 7 (of course) and screw you prevention via wall building. Lastly mix in a sub-VP scoring system based on putting up buildings on seaside lots, and you have this game. On an aside, there is some room for nastiness as you can build over other people's buildings as well, either with your own stuff, or with the church.

Overall the thing fits together, but I didn't feel like there was anything really original present that would make me want to play it again. The permit system has some decent possibilities, as you have to telegraph plays and can interfere with people by building over their stuff, but on a lot of levels the game seemed too limited. For example, I wanted there to be more buildings that did more things, but everything just made a couple of basic types of cards. I can't explain why I found this subjectively unsatisfying, but I think it's just because it looks like there's going to be a bit more there...perhaps due to my experience with Anno 1503, another spin-off with buildings, but with buildings that actually do a wide variety of things.

In any case, I'm rambling. Decent resource gather/race with mild screwage type game. Not bad. But nothing particularly surprising or cool either. Textbook 5.

Played once, I really liked this game, and am looking forward to playing it again soon.  The lack of trading tended to give this game a bit of a mutual solitaire feel, but there's enough competetion for certain prime spots to build that it didn't bother me.  The conflict (pirate) is not as nasty and consequences not as potentially long lasting as the way the robber can hurt someone in basic Settlers, which means my wife will probably like this game.  

I own the German edition.

I've decided that I really, really don't like games where you go backwards.  Since you can build over others' buildings, you can send them backwards in VPs, which really isn't to my taste.  I'm sure it's a fine game for those who like this kind of game, but based on the rating guidelines, I have to rate it this way.  

In some strange way, it sort of feels like "Steve Jackson does Catan".

It feels like a modern day Settlers, yet distinctive from the original and plays well with 2. 

However, while Elasund is a fantastic game it simply is not intuitive to play and is down-right-cut-throat-mean! If your group ever argues over regular Settlers you will absolutely kill each other in Elasund. The game pretty much forces you to be mean. If you want to play nice then you'll lose (generally speaking).

The mechanics of the game work smoothly and feel like a Settlers game, yet is not intutive to play in that it's hard to remember which sets of cards buys what even though you have a summary card. I hate using a summary card and usually get rid of it as soon as possible. I'm still using it!

The game runs much longer than Settlers, takes about 10 minutes longer to setup, and even longer to put away neatly. Don't get me wrong. I really like Elasund and don't mind the length and setup time, but it is a much, much heavier game than regular Settlers. It could be overwhelming to some and simply not fun for others.

In my opinion, this is the best of the Catan-themed games, apart from the original. Plays well with two, three and four, and encourages players to mix it up a bit, via the ability to build over each others buildings. Also Elasund does the best job of balancing out the production die rolls of any Catan game that I have tried (almost all of them, I think), and there are ways for players to stay in the game even when the production die rolls don't go their way. Highly recommended.

A very different additon to the Catan series, or more precisesly, the 'Catan Adventures' series that was pioneered by Candamir.

This one involves players constructing buildings on a gridded board.  There are resources to be used, but there are very few of them, and in a big break from Catan tradition there is no trading phase.  While there was very little interaction in Candamir, there is tons in this game - players can even tear down other player's buildings to build their own.  

I found the game quite interesting, with lots of interaction and a good amount of strategy.  Be aware, though, it's not very much like the other Catan games (with is neither good nor bad, just an observation).

RATING: 7
This is the second game to be released under the "Catan Adventures" moniker (Candamir being the first), but the resemblance to the Settlers of Catan games ends there. Players are working together to build the city of Elasund, but it is not technically a cooperative game, because each player is concerned only with their own goals. The first person to rid themselves of all 10 Victory Point cubes, by constructing Buildings, building Walls, and capturing Trade Locations, wins the game.

Players purchase buildings with Gold cards from their hand, which are to be placed in the town. Before placing a building, though, the player must have the proper number of Building Permits placed on the board. Once a building is placed, depending on building type and size, it may potentially produce Gold, Influence, or Victory Points. I say potentially, because this depends on the Trade Ship.

Each turn, two six-sided dice are rolled and the Trade Ship is moved up or down the coast of the town and any buildings in the corresponding row will produce either Gold or Influence for players that own buildings in that row. If a 7 is rolled, however, it becomes a Pirate Ship ("Ayyy, me hearty") and players in that row must discard cards from their hand, if possible. The player that moved the Pirate Ship can randomly draw from those discards, based on how many Victory Point cubes she has built into the wall surrounding the town. 

Those are the basic mechanics, but one of the most interesting facets of the game is the "screw your neighbor" gameplay that arises out of these mechanics. You see, when you build a new building, you can use building permits placed by other players to satisfy building prerequisites, as long as you have the majority (permits range from 0 to 4 points, which is also the cost, in gold, required to place them). Not only that, but buildings can potentialy replace current structures, as long as they meet certain requirements. You can see that this creates fertile ground for destroying all the hard work opponents have put forth. Oh...and Victory Points are not "locked in", once a player obtains them. If your Victory Point building is destroyed or your Trade Location taken over, your VP cube goes right back into your pool and you have to start from scratch to regain it.

Overall, I think this is a very good game and it will hold up to repeated plays. I do wish that the buildings provided a resource that fit them thematically, instead of generic Influence Cards (which are used to move permits, upgrade permits, or place a bonus permit, by the way) or Gold, but that would be a different and possibly more complex game. I like it for what it is and the production is quite nice, as well. Give it a try.

Link to settlers from rolling dice for resources/cash and winning when you reach 10VP. Beyond that its a tile buying & laying game with a nice variant that you can build over other players tiles. Thankfully this isn't very easy thanks to the permit required so the game doesn't become too much of a "hit the leader" game. In one game, once we realised who was going to win in two more turns, there was nothing we could do about it.
A much deeper game than the Settlers branding would indicate.

This rating is based on one play only so it will likely change after a few more plays. Some thoughts:

- The dice luck component doesn´t seem to be that important as in Settlers.

Look forward to another play to see if I've rated it correctly.  Could go up or down.

Players are establishing a village on Catan.  Players rolls dice which triggers a McMulti-like avalanche of production along the rolled number's row.  Goods are either "resource" cards, or gold cards.  Gold is spent on putting building permit chips on the board, which is turned into buildings via more gold.  Bigger buildings trump smaller buildings on the grid (leading to their relocation/removal), but require more gold and permits.  The church is expensive and trumps everything.  Points are awarded for buildings, building on trade routes, and constructing the perimeter wall.  Confrontational, and possibly quite nasty with the wrong group, but certainly better than Candamir (yawn!), and very attractive to look at!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fun little building game with tight competition for space, and lots of opportunities to remove others' resource-productions and build your own. It is not quite as fast or interesting as the similar McMulti, and I really mean when I say not fast! This is a good design but the length is too much for the payout. A great potential 'next step' game but not enough going on to satisfy most hardcore gamers either.

It is a better game than Settlers, but it has the same flaws. Dice rolls, a lagging end-game, and a crap-shoot for the win. It's more interesting than Settlers, and less fickle - you don't feel stuck waiting until the end of the game. It is still 'a Teuber', and still 'a Catan'.

Catan for gamers.  Now, I'm not at all a Catan hater.  SoC is my gateway game of choice, and I'll always be up for a play.  However, and I'm not sure if this is fair or not, I've got to drop my SoC score a half point after playing Elasund, as this game has really made me aware of what parts of SoC I like and which I'm happy to live without.  Elasund maintains the struggle for higher-probability land but controls the luck factor much better.  There's always something you can do on your turn, even if it's just to relax and earn some free gold.  Lots and lots of tough choices here, and you can be as aggressive as you dare.  I do miss the trading element a bit, but that's not what this game is about!  Elasund also works very well as a 2-player game, which is definitely not true of SoC.  The rating could climb after some more plays.

(I was so tired I kept nodding off during the rules, and consequently I didn't exactly know what I was doing.)  I'd give it another chance.  But I remember it as really vicious. I like Catan, but this, not so much.

The good news, it's Settlers. The bad news, it's Settlers. Trading element is removed and while there is some interaction through board-placement, basically this felt somewhat solitaire-esque. I was disappointed, there is less of an RPG element than in Candamir.

The building and building over mechanic is very interesting.  I especially like the church, which is never finished but is always looming to cause problems for its neighbors.  I always really enjoy this game.  Unfortunately, many of those I play with regularly hate it.  They dislike the whole building permit component, which is a crucial aspect of this excellent game.  What do they know?

I’ve played probably over 200 games of Settlers and really enjoyed it there for a while (before I found BGG), but I’m done with it and don’t want to play it again probably, like, ever.  So I was surprised at how much I liked this Catan game.

I found this game to be much deeper than I expected and with some nice offensive and defensive aspects to it.  First off, the dice here are a randomizer but not nearly as powerful a one as in Settlers.  Unlike Settlers, you have more options as to where to build things, and you can build over someone.  But it’s the building permits that really make it for me.  It’s a game of brinksmanship and one-upmanship in placing permits and co-opting others’ for your purposes.  You can use someone else’s permit to build over their building (smashy-smashy!), so the game can be quite, uh, interactive (read: nasty) to say the least. No multiplayer solitaire here.  At the same time, you can build things in such a way that your buildings are protected.

And there are a lot of ways to score here.  You can build regular buildings, the Church, city walls, or use certain spots on the board to advance on some special track. You place your VP cubes on those and when you’ve placed 10, you win. What’s unique here is that you can build over other people and thus remove their cubes from the board/special track, knocking them back.  So there’s more to stop someone than just not trading with them.

On the downside, that last feature can also be a flaw because it means you keep knocking each other back and the game can go on longer than it should. Still, a nice, nasty little game.

I played this for the first time with two others that were playing it for the first time too. We stumbled through the game and discovered the nasty side of pre-empted building permits toward the end of the game. It's a fairly good city-building game, which I like, but the stealing-permits factor is a downside.

RATING: 10
(2-4 players) Good number of choices during play. The resource-to-production arc can be interrupted by building displacement leaving you out to dry after a rousing start. A good dose of bash the leader too. Still, a pretty good game and a pretty game to look at.
Upgraded: This is simply a fantastic game. I wouldn't say I "always want to play it" but the 10 rating reflects excellent balancing and fun design. The fact that it scales extremely well doesn't hurt either.

Update 2017:
Played a 4p game with first time players and the game dragged on when people didn't grasp the permit/build system. Winner mostly did things where building only required gold and squatted on a few trade spots. So, still a great game but can drag on if people aren't confident enough to grasp the permit/build thing.

The total lack of player inter-action really pulled this experience down for me. In Settlers, if the dice are against you, you can still try trading your way out, and you have multiple paths to victory. In Elasund, there were multiple ways to score, but still only one path; make more money. The players raking in the gold can push to build faster. That's all that really matters, the influence cards have some effect, but quite limited. I won, and we could all see I was going to win two rounds ahead of it. But when it wasn't my turn, I had nothing to do but whine. I'll probably buy this, but I'm not enamoured.

A better more involved Catan version.  Plays well with 2 players and while the game certainly offers a lot more than the plain vanilla Catan, the usual rich get richer was observed in our games.  True, one can build over other players buildings but the permit placement limits the free-for-all that could knock back an early leader.  Not turning it down for a few more tries though.

A strange game. It's a little like Catan, but there is no resource management nor trading. Here, placement is the most important thing almost making the game feel a little like Carcassonne. Still the rules are a bit counter-intuitive, which doesn't usually happen in a Catan variation. UPDATE: Most recent games, with some rule corrections, have been a lot more enjoyable. This game plays surprisingly well with only 2 players.

Szabályok alapján tetszett a koncepció, hogy kiszedik a catanból megismert kereskedést, viszont helyette betesznek egy absztrakt kicsit agyalós tile placement mechanizmust. Egy játék után arra jutottam, hogy nem lett ettől még jobb, sőt csak rosszabb lett, mint a catan. A fő baj, hogy megmaradt a kockadobálás, de a felülépítésekkel bejött mellé egy nagy adag, és azon belül is igen fájdalmas fajta kitolós faktor. Így se családi (kitolás), se gémer (szerencse) játéknak nem tudom elképzelni. Kár érte.

Arra gondoltam, hogy adok neki még egy esélyt, hátha igazságtalan voltam elsőre. Hát még tovább esett a megítélése a második játék után. Ez a token rakás is minősíthetetlen. Ha nem dobsz olyat, ahová építkezni szeretnél, akkor megette a fene az egészet. Persze a kártyák segíthetnének, de hogy emiatt építs 3-4 falat, hogy egy épületet lerakhass oda, ahová szeretnél, az finoman szólva is nem megtérülős.

Összességében az egész játék olyan, mintha mindenki dobna egy kockával, és aki a legkisebbet dobja, az mindenkitől kapna egy kurva nagy pofont, aztán jöhet a következő kör.

Each time we played we missed, at least, one rule. That never happened to us before. It is either fate or the rules are very badly written. I vote for the second choice.

The progression of the game is slow and monotonous. Also, it feels like the initial design was flawed and a few - out of nowhere - rules were added to correct the problems. For instance, the "running out of cards" rule is downright stupid and very, very unclear.

RATING: 7
Elasund is a real neat Klaus Teuber spinoff from the Catan series.  I really appreciate the multiple ways to get victory points, the increasing pressure of building in a city that quickly loses space, the relative "weakness" of the pirates (which are inconvenient, without being as frustrating as Settlers), and there are a few other good mechanics here.  Elasund is all Teuber, but with enough differences that you feel like you're playing a game that isn't simply a Settlers variant.  I feel that most of the luck in the game is mitigated, more so than Catan, and I rarely felt like I couldn't go through with my plans in at least my current or next turn.  Turns move quickly and AP is usually low.  Overall I think it is a nice addition to the Catan series - though the player screwage in this game hurts more sometimes here than it does in Catan!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I often forget this one (maybe because it looks a bit boring). But once I get started I really like it. Always surprised by how wicked it is.

Update: played last night, thought it very repetitive, also tired of the catan system of gaining stuff through dice. It works but bores me.
I'll give it a 6. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Wow!! Just when I felt the breath of Catan was failing Elasund came through the pipes like a sweet melody.  Although people complain about the dice rolling, Elasund really appears to have a much stronger ability to create opportunites around the probabilities.  Elasund offers some real stategic and tactical gameplay with what I feel is a high level of player interaction -  so what if it's confrontational and full of screwage.  I find that most of my favorite games has that uncontrolled element of luck hidden somewhere within, although I usually prefer some other means than a roll of dice, Elasund works for me.  More playings are required however to fully learn this games staying power - until then this scores an 8 for me, and I look forward to my next playing.

UPDATE:
After playing a few more times, this game is definetly a strong 8 for me.  I enjoy how confrontational Elasund is for a euro.  This is a very solid design that offers a lot of real decisions.  It is important to build a strong economy that is balanced on the higher probability numbers between influence and money, and also to use permits wisely to make things more difficult for your opponents, while maximising their placement for your own benefit.

Superb game. My wife's favourite... and one of my favourites as well. It is well balanced - enough luck, but not too much, and always tense. The good thing about Elasund is that it is not only a clever and perfectly designed game, but also a highly interactive, very competitive and pretty nasty one *. Different strategies will lead to victory. Works fine with 2 players as well.

In my top 5.

* My advice : Try it before you buy it, if your gaming partners don't like confrontation.

They say this is another version of Catan. And they are wrong. There are some similar mechanisms but all in all this is a very different game. You still have to roll the dice but there are many ways to overcome randomness.

The downside is that I can barely imagine to play Elasund with my family. A lot of interaction can be very aggresive. It's closer to a gamers' game than to a family game. But which gamer would like to play something with "Catan" in the name? And this is the main problem with playing it.

RATING: 7
Initial rating with 2 players, could go up. The first run-through with this is a bit grueling. 

Update: Raised it from 6 to 7. Lots of opportunity for creative land management. And nasty, nasty screwage. Even when winning, I never feel safe, and this is good. Still only 2-player, and I'm hesitant to try with more, for fear of overwhelming chaos.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting building game.  Some clear Catan mechanisms, yet gameplay feels quite different than standard Settlers - more direct interplay and an almost wargamey "don't get too involved with a fight with one player lest another get a free ride" kind of feel.  If you don't have cards in hand to respond to threatys you can be quite vulnerable.  Definitely worth a few plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The best Catan spin-off game? Maybe.

This game finds itself in a difficult position.  For those who like other Catan games, you have some Catan-like mechanics to make you feel at home, but at the same time, this game can be very confrontational.  If you like a good confrontational game with a high screwage factor, you may like this game, but you may be turned off by Catan dice rolling and resource gathering.  This Catan game may be too aggressive for Catan folk, and too 'Catany'(tm) for other players.

I can't help but compare buildings in this game to the buildings and resources in Anno.  In Elasund, the buildings are kind of generic, as are the resources.  In Anno, different buildings produce different resources.  There is more of an emphasis on certain resources leading towards different upgrades in Anno,
whereas in Elasund, every building is just a combo of gold and permits.  It isn't as satisfying I think.  Then again, it may not be a good idea to get attached to your own buildings anyway.

I definitely enjoy the game, but it does seem like it can drag a little bit there towards the end.  Solid, evil game.

The familiar resource production mechanic was improved, and other than that, it is completely different from other "Catan" games. This is an original tile-laying game with some mean direct confrontation. There is a clever mechanic of needing permits to build, and the turn sequence dictates that they can only be placed after you build. So, other players have a chance to react before their buildings can be destroyed by yours. Luck is tolerable and there are ways to go around it. My only gripe is that although it belongs to the "Catan Adventures" series, there is absolutely no sense of adventure, which was very present in "Candamir".

Funny that this from the World of Catan, as it's a more strategic and nasty game than any other Catan game. You can "destroy" your opponents buildings and use their permitsfor it. There's no peaceful trading, just fierce competition.

That doesn't only set it apart from the other Catan games, it's probably the best one, even though the dice and placing your buildings is still important in this game.

Good game, but it could be better with the right tweaks.

An interesting game that has nothing to do with SETTLERS OF CATAN.

The building permit mechanic adds an extra level of strategy, as does the possibility of building over smaller buildings.

There may be some down time during the first game, but that is to be expected with most games.  While other players are taking their turns, everyone should be reviewing the board and figuring out their next move(s), or checking out how they can block other players.

The luck factor is limited, and should be viewed more as a bonus, as you can trade the building permit phase for 2 gold.

Each player controls his/her destiny by selecting different actions.  Although you'd like to do everything, you are limited in what you can do.  Nothing wrong with that, in my books.

After one play with 2 players, this one seems overrated. The pirates, a wonderful idea for 3+ players, do nothing but add luck and limit your options in the early game. 

The church makes the real state in the 2 player game tiny. After a couple of pieces are built, it's pretty likely that there's only 2 or 3 buildings in the good spots. Since the only way to get influence in the late game is through dice rolls, the game seems to come down to a few good placements... not exactly what I was looking for.

While it has the "roll to produce income" system from Settlers, everything else feels completely different. The building mechanism is excellent and gives lots of possibilities. And after setup, two experienced players can play this in 30 minutes (I was surprised how well this plays with two, although it is better with more). Great game, in my opinion.

RATING: 7
Another Settlers spin-off, from an industry where originality has always been a precious commodity. This incarnation incorporates many ideas from the basic game: die rolling for resources, covering the numbers, bonus VPs etc., but the destructive element means that the end can be a long time coming.

Interesting Catan spinoff, I like the way the city gets built up. Much nastier than Settlers though, with lots of take that type interaction which didn't appeal to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Okay, so it's got a very simplified resource management game, where gold and cards are the only resources, and the question is how to use them and when to get rid of other people's buildings. So there's a little bit of a tug of war as resource production changes based on that. Seemed more abstract than Settlers and, while clever, kind of weird.  (1 play)

No es un Catán vitaminado, porque no hay comercio. Efectivamente, para jugones que ya estén "más allá" de los clásicos iniciales. Me gustaron las diversas posibilidades que hay para poder puntuar, poder sobreconstruir a tu adversario (el puteo del juego) y el relativo azar de los dados, mucho más controlable que en Catán. PROS Más hostil que otros eurogames (puedes perder PV's gracias a las jugarretas de los demás), muy escalable. CONS: telegrafías tu jugada al colocar los permisos (eso no gusta a todo el mundo)

First game with 4 players. Elasund is attractively presented and there are some interesting aspects to the game. However, thanks to the use of some of the obligatory Catan series mechanics (resource production dependent on 2d6, game ends when a player reaches a certain number of VPs) Elasund appears to suffer from exactly the same problems as Settlers of Catan - the element of chance is too influential and the game can drag at times (particularly towards the end of the game). My rating would increase if, once we've become more familiar with the game, its length decreases substantially and the possibilities of more subtle tactical play open up.

Rating: 8 w/event cards to reduce luck.  This is a great game but it has the same dice-rolling luck as does Settlers of Catan.  If you like Settlers, you will probably like this game as well, although they are not extremely similar.  Use the Settlers event cards instead of rollling dice.  My brother owns a copy.

I picked this up off the prize table at the Gathering on Larry Levy's recommendation.  I enjoyed my play.  Its kind of like Anno 1503 with some "screw you" interaction.  Still, some of the standard Settlers elements (dice rolling, bad things happening on a 7) are wearing a little thin, and I think this would be a better game without them.

Deserving of a more catchy name. This one is quite enjoyable even though I never tend to win. I really like the pacing of the direct-conflict in this Catan game. Play it 2 or 4 player.

Thankfully, more hostile than most Eurogames, Elasund has many different ways to step on other players toes.  

It does an admirable job of being playable with 2-players, (better than most) but is still much, much better with 3-4.

NOTE: Most non-gamers have a little trouble with this one at first, but catch on eventually after a game or two.  May be advisable to start with "Settlers" before moving on to "Elasund".

Expansions would be welcome.

RATING: 6
Good game with multiple strategies.  Quite agressive sometimes and the leader can very easily be (and very often is) the object of this agressiveness.
There is a minimum resemblance to famous Settlers of Catan.

EDIT:  Ooops.  My 6th game was insanely luck-driven and with huge snowball effect.  Also - after loong break I didn't find the game so demanding and appealing like I used to...

Sold.

RATING: 6
initial rating one play

Middle of the road first impression play with 3 players, i can see it scaling well so player number probably not important and a strength for this game. Just a tad like a Settlers with 2d6 rolls dishing out goods and some fighting for positions on the board but no trading here. Buildings can be built over other buildings which is a constant threat adding good interaction and screwage. Overall seemed good although not "great" as something seemed missing, I want to play again with 2 and 4 but especially 2 to see if it is indeed worth buying.

I like plain ol' Settlers just fine which is not a game I'd normally choose to play but I'm willing enough if other people want to.

My wife and I have played this game 15+ times as a two-player game.  For those who don't mind an agressive game it scales very well down to two.  If your partner doesn't like conflict this game will probably be a bust, as it is possible to use opponent's building permits and build over their buildings.  Just as with the original Settlers of Catan dice rolls play a part in the game, but cards do allow you to perform actions even when the dice are not working in your favour.

Very nice spin off of settler's!  In our 4 player game it was as close as it could get with the winner obviously having 10 VP's, but the rest of us had 9 VP's!

All in all, quite a bit of fun.

The finagling of permits and buildings on the grid is the best part of the game and works well. The gold and influence cards are slow and difficult to obtain, which is supposed to add another strategic element, but I think is where the game comes up a bit short. Your primary method for collecting cards is by rolling the dice at the beginning of the turn, which means you collect usually 0-3 cards every turn, more commonly zero than three. This mechanic works well in Catan because you can trade with the other players for cards that you need. There is no trading in Elasund, which makes this mechanic feel just slow and luck driven. You can build on higher probability numbers to increase your chances, but this still seems insufficient to keep the game moving at a consistent pace. Many turns pass where you feel like you are just waiting for the gold and influence to come to you, which isn't all that satisfying. While the tile placement works really well, the Catan-esque part of the game doesn't. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played about five times.  It's one of the more interesting Settlers variants, as many of your points are never "in the bank" due to a unique feature that allows other players to overbuild buildings to take points away from one player to another.  I like it because this game is a bit more dynamic than regular Settlers; also, because of the order in which things must be done on a player's turn, you usually get some warning before disaster may strike.

RATING: 5.5
Dry and incremental.  Players are collecting two commodities: gold and trade goods.  The trade goods certainly do affect strategy, but what they help you do just doesn't feel exciting.  Unlike Settlers, where building production buildings gets you victory points, here building VP buildings is likely to COST you production.  So growing your position at times feels like more of a chore than progress.  Overall, the game felt like a slog.  I respect the design as a game, but they need to ratchet up the fun factor. [2 playings]

RATING: 6
I've played 2 player, 3 player and 4 player.  4 player was more enjoyable; more space initially yet more competition later on. But 2 player was also fun (and surprisingly fast) and the game seems well balanced. I was initially concerned about the confrontational aspects of the game, but in reality have found it's no big deal - you have to plan for it and make sure you're victory cubes are spread across certain VPs (church, towers, etc.) and those which are at risk.  I've never found I have enough to do everything I want, which is something I enjoy as it forces difficult decisions to be made.  Production quality is outstanding; probably the best I have seen in a game.  Component quality is super-sturdy and the art is beautiful.

The multiple ways to score along with the destruction of already built buildings keeps everyone in the game.

The similarities to any of the other Catan games are superficial at best (you receive gold/influence cards based on dice rolls, and a 7 can hurt the other players), but having Settlers play such a big role in my gaming development means that I probably give this a little more attention than I would otherwise.  It's an aggressive game, but you pretty much have to get used to the fact that your buildings will be built over, sometimes even by yourself.  I like how it plays quickly and I have a feeling that I will enjoy this game more as I get in more plays.  I quickly learned to not underestimate the importance of influence cards and building permit placement.  You get obsessed with picking up money, but you really have to watch out for what your opponents are doing.  Also, this plays really well with 2 players.

Traded away.

Great game! Obviously Settlers related, but still different! More confrontational than standard Settlers, and learning how to use your influence cards takes a little while, as there are several times in a turn to play, and several combos. One of my friends and gaming buddies still hasn´t found out how it works, even after 5-10 games...

An extremely well-designed city building game based in the Catan world. There is quite a bit of randomness, but positioning yourself to build-over someone's building is quite cool. Towards the end, the game gets a bit nasty (bash-the-leader), but I found it heaps better than its cousin Candamir.

[LUP 29-Jul-2007] I have only played this once to date, but really quite enjoyed.  It is a bash the leader Settlers variant and playing with Melissa, Stefanie and Shawn we were all quite willing to smash the leader.  People who don't like the bash the leader type of play should possibly avoid it, but those who don't mind that may be pleasantly surprised.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Based on 3 plays.  I enjoy Elasund because it contains a healthy element of combat without feeling overly hostile.  Due to the mechanics, any aggressive move you make must be advertised well in advance, giving the other player a turn or two to respond.  The resulting conflict is more like a formal duel than a vicious backstab.  The only critique of the game is that it is a bit long, especially with four players.

RATING: 8
Really solid, with negative random interaction that is more surmountable than Catan, but not sure who I can play this with to reach its full potential given that in order to win it's necessary to actively take-over development spaces that other players have carved out. Hard feelings and all.

I was never bitten by the Settlers of Catan bug, but Elasund has gotten under my skin.  I played it for the first time at BGG.CON (2005) and then waited impatiently for the game to reach American shores.  It's a good design that is simple but full of possibilities.  Player interaction is unavoidable and the "screwage" factor can be high.  A thorougly enjoyable game.

Interesting game with a few simple and different mechanisms and strategies mixed skillfully into one (as usual with Teuber). Many nice little idea (I especially like the church part and also I find it funny that I can build on others' buildings). It takes one play to learn all the rules but after that it feels like a good (or, might say, better) Catan game - slow build-up and then in the end everyone's scores vary step by step between 5 and 9 until somebody eventually reaches 10. Yes there is a factor of luck in it but it's a lot less than in Catan (those cards can change a lot). Nice family game.

One play.  Everything I hate about Settlers (dice often helping the others on your turn more than you), combined with one of my most despised game mechanics: deliberate screwing of other players for very minimal gain.  And it's not like this aspect is small or one of several, varied game mechanics; it's constant after about the 4th turn.  Pass forever.

It's Settlers meet Princes of Florence on crack.  It's quite good but there is a *lot* going on at all times.  I can't help but to feel that the complexity doesn't make the game as rich as it should.

RATING: 9
This game NOT really a Catan game.  It only has a "vague" theme of Catan put on it but if you take the word "Catan" and "Settlers" off the box & rules, you would not recognize it except for the dice mechanism.  (It works fine without being "marketed" or "thematically used" as Catan but it does sell more with that label attached so it's understandable why it's there.)  

Elasund has some potential screw-your-opponent since spaces where your tiles occupy can be replaced by an opponent's larger buildings or church tiles, but that's partly why I like, b/c it's very different altogether.  It's not nasty enough that it's "easy" to exploit your opponent(s) as it costs more influence/gold and planning.  It's not always easy to get the right cards to screw the leader (whereas in Settlers, all you need is to roll a 7 or have a robber card).  

I find it very balanced and scalable having played it with 2, 3 or 4 players and they all work well.  Gold and influence cards are almost equal  so it depends on your circumstances and what you wish to do.  You need to get 10 VPs to win and there are multiple strategies to this effect so specializing may or may not work out in the long run.

RATING: 6
Most likely the best Catan breakoff game out there.  Can be cut-throat in that not only can you steal resources, you can also demolish other players' buildings to build over them.  Victory points can be earned by building a part of the church, every third wall, various buildings, and building over enough windmills.  After several plays, I'm beginning to question if the church isn't overpriced.  I've yet to see anyone who pursues the church win the game.

I have only played once, but few games have made such a good impression on me in one play as this game did. There is so much going on underneath the veneer of strategies in this game, I definitely want to see how deep the rabbit hole goes. I would definitely recommend this game over the original SoC.

I like the original settlers of catan a lot. (have only played it once) Elasund is at least almost as good. Only thing that I don't like about it is rolling the die, I seem to be very good at rolling it so that my opponent gets a lot of gold :S

edit: I think my rating of this game will go down a bit after some games. Too much luck maybe.

RATING: 8
Best Catan game since the original. In fact for me it's better than the original. It's meaner and you have a lot more control on your destiny. It's easier to mitigate bad luck (by forfeiting permits and claiming gold), it's more dynamic (you can build anywhere you want so everybody can have it's building on "lucky 6-8"), positionnal and tactical elements is real important. 

You can't play a solitaire game because everything other player's do, also affects you: opponents can "steal" your permits spots, they can destroy your buildings or forbid you to build by putting pricy permits next to yours.

First game was a bit long (2h) but second one was way quicker (1h).  

Update: Really good game with 2 players. Very nasty and quick. We are able to make in a game in 25 minutes!

Fantastic twist to the "Settlers Odds" system. Much more of a gamer's game than any other in the series IMHO, and many more ways to directly effect your opponents.

Update:

A little long for what it is, especially since experienced players can drive this to a weird end game. Perhaps it's our group think, but either way it's for trade.

Games are always tense and this scales very well from 2-4 players, by increasing the size of the map AND without compromising the fun. With more players there's a bit more nastiness to expect [smaller buildijngs being destroyed by bigger buildings]. One should constantly adapt the tactics to select the right road to victory.

Splendid material, good theme, simple and rich rules.  Accessible for all players and offer
A lot of interaction between players since oplayers can be blocked or can have their buildings crushed.  The games combine strategy with the long term and opportunism. The factor of luck is not as strong as the Settlers of Catane since the play is balanced and allows players who badly started, to go up itself by adapting their strategy. In addition, the ways of marking points are numerous.

Great 2-player game. So-so as a 4-player game. As a 2-player game I'd rate this a 7. As for 3-4 players it rates a 4.

With 3 or 4 players the endgame seems to drag. Elasund is novel for a Catan game as their is direct conflict in the form of building over smaller (or same size viz a viz resource cards) buildings.

09/26/06 Received. I like all things Settler-ish. Though this one strays farther from the base game than any other I've played. So much so that no knowledge of the base game is required. I like that it scales well from 2 to 4 players. I enjoy the nastiness factor (over-building) that's missing from Settlers of Catan and most of its spin-offs.

Ugh, so much downtime! Mechanics didn't feel especially novel or interesting; walked away with a pronounced 'blah' feeling. There is some strategy and some take-that (which I like), but a lot of luck (this is settlers after all) and LOTS of downtime; absolutely nothing to do on anybody else's turn but talk about last night's trip to the strip club.

RATING: 7
A clever Catan variation that plays much different than the original and has more of a mean streak in that you could tear down your opponents' buildings.  One commentor likened the dice throws more to McMulti which is correct except you only produce (money or cards) when the dice roll lines up with your buildings on the east to west axis (and not also on the north to south axis).  Multiple ways to score victory points and plenty of decisions to make.  In my first play I heard the time-honored Catan complaint "X&Y are never being rolled so I haven't been able to produce anything."  Tough-luck.

I heard that this was a more gamer-y version of Catan, but I found it extremely boring. It definitely feels like a game from the Catan family, but the acquisition of money and contracts is so dull. There's nothing to trade here, which takes away most of the fun from Catan, for me. This game is also far more spiteful in comparison. I would rather just play regular Catan, because this game is a snooze-fest that wears out its welcome far longer than it should.

Now, I don't usually give nines lightly, and as this rating is based on just a handful of plays, I might be overreacting, but...
Elasund has everything I look for in a game: nice components, minimal fiddliness, clear goals, a well integrated, appealing theme, and a depth of strategy and tactics that belies the simple and concise rules. The three main balance issues I look for are pitched perfectly (more tactics than strategy, more construction than destruction, more risk calculation than perfect moves), and while everything more or less clicked by turn three, I was left with a feeling of only having scratched the surface.
Brilliant!

Only one 3p play of this so far, and I can't say I enjoyed the experience. :-(  The game was [u]long[/u] (almost 3 hrs!), and I  had no hope of coming in better than last-place for the last couple of those.  Like many Catan games, this one has a "rich get richer" problem -- a couple of bad plays early in the game will shut you out completely with no hope of catching up.  The only power you then have is to play kingmaker among the leaders.

The game has some clever ideas, such as the system for permit placement, and I suspect it would be a reasonably good fun if all the players have balanced resources by mid-game.  I might try it again to find out.

Had the chance to play this 2player and it was again excellent - and gameplay is MUCH quicker with experience!  Bumped up to a 10 without reservation.

Is this similar to SoC? Hell no!!
This game is agressive, tense and can be a real brainburner!!
Elasund is becoming one of my favourite games and what is important is that its somewhere between heavy and family games. 
Another plus is that it plays great with 2.

Elasund sure has Catan feeling in it with dice rolling and collecting resources. Other parts of game feel fresh and doesn't seem like repetation of the same old. I only have played two player games but those were very good with 30 min playtime and enough to do and think about. My rating for two player game is 8. Most likely game is equally good with more players but there is potential kingmaker problem with buildings.

Update (24.8.2006) : It seems the game gets chaotic with 4 players and building and rebuilding. Game gets a bit too chaotic for my taste. I can enjoy it with two but not with 4.

The usual Catan mechanisms are there: Dice rolling for resources, and the 10 victory points. Beyond that, it's quite different, and nasty. Too many bad moves won't go unpunished.

Un gioco molto carino perché semplice ma non banale. La componente 'dadi' aggiunge il giusto quantitativo di fattore k.
Decisamente meglio di Candamir-il primo colono di Catan, anche questo nasce dalla serie di Catan. Notevole l'interazione tra i giocatori che ostacola le strategie già pianificate.
Strategicamente penso sia importante puntare sulle monete d'oro, poi sui bastioni e infine sulla costruzione degli edifici.
Un bel gioco che scala bene a seconda del numero di giocatori.

Preliminary rating after one play.  Perhaps I've been told too many times about how good the game is, but it felt a little uninspired.  Might have been because of 1 player who took far too long on turns, making what would be a good 45 minute game into a poor 90 minute game.

The production values are very nice, and Mayfair / Kosmos get bonus points for having a box that actually has some spare room in it - just right for the free expansion (via .pdf) they released.

But overall kind of 'meh'.  I'll play, but probably won't pick it up.

I must say, this game is one of my new favorites. It scales great from two players to four (the building area shrinks), has a lot of strategy and a lot of possible paths. It does take a few turns to get the hang of all that you can do, but any Euro gamer will catch on pretty fast. If you like Catan, but want a little more strategy or possible actions on each turn, this is a great choice. I say it is a must have in almost any collection.

A Catan game that isn't very much like Settlers.  There isn't any resource trading, and there is only one kind of resource plus money.  The dice rolling and resource production is similar, and there's building.  I like this game with two or three players.

RATING: 6
Despite being in the "Catan universe", Elasund doesn't really share much with Settlers.  You're still building on spots corresponding to numbers that can be rolled on 2d6, but here the numbers are ordered in a line and anything built in that row activates on the right roll (it makes me think I'm building on a bell curve).  You're building tiles that can occupy multiple rows, and those tiles can be displaced by another person's building (if they have a bigger tile) or the game (if the church wants to build there) with no recompense, which feels a little wonky.  You get points for building certain buildings or building tiles in certain places.  I didn't really find anything about the game especially compelling, but it's not a bad game.

A good variant to Catan, with more interaction and jerkiness.  The game has a good mix of luck with tactics, advanced planning with permits and positioning, and many different build options.  I like how it has a similar feel, yet is different than Catan.

The game can be a little too jerky with your hard fought buildings getting knocked down.  The acquiring the building permits and positioning can be slower and annoying.

Very nice first impression. Like the nasty streak. A bit to involved and nasty to be a real family game and maybe a bit to random to be a real gamer's game. Like it at lot though. Has that certain "has to play it again and try that" feel to it.

*Update* After several plays has proven to be rather formulaic. Gold is better than Influence. Build three walls ASAP. Build a couple of gold producers, secure their positions with smart placement (piggy back on other players) and start building the church fast fast fast. And then it's all up to the dice.

Vey similar to settlers in that players roll for resources at the start of a turn and then build things trying to acheive a VP goal.  The biggest differences are no trading and you can build over other players' buildings.  In place of trading there are more options for building. Building over top other buildings means its harder to get stuck with no way out. I highly recommended step up from Settlers.

Of the Catan family of games that I have played (Original Catan, Cities & Knights, Stone Age, Candamir, Anno 1503,) I like this one the most. Some of the reasons: a lot less luck dependant, initial setup is balanced, more play options and much more meaningful and interesting decision making.

RATING: 8
The second game of the Adventure Catan serie. Interestingly, this one felt a little more dependent on the dice rolls to me, yet more strategic. I know this sounds contradictory, but I think that the placement of permits and the influence cards add a lot to the game in the sense of countering ‘screwage’ (and screwing) other players.

Regarding the random element of the dice, I must say that rolling a 7 feels much less prejudicial than in Settlers of Catan. The right numbers not coming up on the couple first turns can be quite slowing - and very likely to put some other players in advantage. This is less present in Catan as it is mitigated by the possibility of trading. Also, the mechanic helps very little in balancing the game, trying to hold the player who’s in lead. I believe that the robbers are much more efficient at that.

I would risk saying that this is more unbalanced than it’s older brother. Nevertheless, I believe it manages to be more strategic due to the already mentioned permits allocation.

As to each of them I think is better, I’d say it still a tie and will depend on the mood. Catan is much more lighthearted while Elasund provides a more intense gaming experience.

First 3-player game was engrossing from beginning to end. Lots of choices with no obvious best one. Might be better with 4 as the screwage factor is quite high and, in the 3-player game, a successful mid-game player will get hammered by the other two without being able to react to both threats on the board. Building 3 walls to be sure to have a tower in play is important and thus should be built as much as possible while the walls only cost 2 gold. The double windmill sites are very powerful and will elicit fights. Only 3 or 4 church tiles were placed which lessened the impact of initial tile choice, but the way to victory might entail building more of the church in the next game. Plan to purchase with next order.

One of the mean eurogames. The interaction between player is obvious. Not realy the sort of games to make friends. The main thing about this game is that the randomness of the dice trowing make the game less strategical. This point will dislike some people for whoom luck is not good in a game.
The material is superb and the rules are simple and well explained in the rulebook. Not realy good for two players game.

Un des jeu européens le plus méchant qu'il y ait. L'interaction entre les joueurs est évidente. Pas le genre de jeu pour se faire des amis. Le point principale de ce jeu est le fait que le tir des dés rend le jeu plus aléatoire et moins stratégique. Ce point ne sera pas apprécié des joueurs pour qui la chance n'a pas sa place dans un jeu. Le matériel est superbe et les règles sont claires et bien expliquées. Pas vraiment bon à deux joueurs.

The only mechanic I truly adore about this game is how players can cooperate through building permits to help a player build a large building to demolish another. Doesn't feel as torturous as SoC since (it seems) you get resources more frequently.

However, the annoying things about SoC still exist with this one:
* "Unlucky" dice rolls
* The plodding, non-accelerating pace to get up to ten points

Better than the original Settlers of Catan (which I consider a great game).  No trading with other players (unsure whether it would be better or worse if it had any), but MUCH more player interference with each others' ambitions and tactics.  Choices expand exponentially until the endgame when the city fills up, bringing on a final few rounds of squeeze plays and an overall winner.  Very very fun from beginning to end.

i'm not a huge fan of vanilla settlers, but i often find that enjoy the catan off-shoots much more. i have to say that of the ones i've played so far this one is probably my favorite. elasund is surprisingly heavy and confrontational for a catan game. the rules aren't too difficult, but they might take a few plays to get completely right. i absolutely love the building permit system and how one player can help another build while simultaneously costing her more to do so. i can foretell that people will complain about the die rolls, especially in a game of this length and complexity. honestly though, there are plenty of opportunities for players to position themselves for the production role payouts and there are so many options available to players in game that i think players will be making their own luck. it's a shame that this game seems to be destined to be somewhat overlooked by the bgg community because this is a very tense and fun game.

Rated after one play. Elasund is a good Eurogame in the economic-development genre: first you build buildings that make you money, later you use the money to build buildings that earn you Victory Points.

Development game with the ability to interfere with your opponent's buildings.  With more experience, think it possible to better defend your own buildings - so expect this not to be as "you build it, I bash it" as the first game was.  One downside is gamelength as the VP's can go up and down a bit more instead of a more steady progression to 10.  If the game speeds up with additional plays - can see the rating going up.  Do like it better than base Catan - but both suffer from "need the right rolls early to get goods to start developing".  But at the moment, prefer Antike over this game as it offers the same development, resoure management, modest conflict in a much quicker and neater package.

I really liked this Catan spin-off. A pretty nasty affair complete with overbuilding and fierce competition for prime real estate. Multiple ways (at least 3) to victory, and only two types of "resources" to deal with. This game didn't need the Catan label stuck on it, and I think it would perfectly succeed as a stand-alone title.

The components are outstanding, complete with a spiffy box insert and perfectly informative player aids. Thus game screams for a full-fledged expansion: a couple sheets of new tile buildings, and the life of this game would exponentially increase. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I have a very good time with this game.  Great area control while screwing the other players.  Definitely the most cut throat of the Catan games.

Strategy - Build cheap $2 city walls as fast as possible.  Then build the $4 city walls.  This the best way to get influence cards early.  Do not use influence cards to get money unless absolutely needed.  Make sure to be the first player to build the church so you can decide what direction it is built toward to protect your starting buildings.  Build the four space influence and money huts to up your incomes.  Build them on windmills for an added bonus.

This combines just too many things that I don't care for. The rules are unnecessarily complicated and just don't gel into a nice flow. It's really vicious and competitive, and everybody destroys other peoples stuff. You can actually lose points! All this building up for nothing... It really drags on after everybody has their first 3 or 4 VP, because the board is pretty full by then and you have to take away the winning players VP by building over them, and thus prolong the game, rinse and repeat for the next player...
Also, no real interaction - at least settlers had trading, but here the only interaction you can have is squarely negative. Palpable undertones of frustration and aggression at the table.
And on your first play, forget about having any chance against somebody who's played before. They know what to look out for while you're still getting your bearings and find your way around the board. Just not fun, and I prefer to have fun on my first game of something, even if I'm losing, or I won't feel like playing again.

This is a game very dependent upon the number and speed of the players involved. With four players my rating for this goes down to a two. I wouldn't mind playing with maybe three very fast players, but definitely not four, no matter how fast they play. Did I mention that you won't catch me playing this with four players?! With two the game seems to come down mostly to luck of the dice. With four the game can drag on and on beyond its claimed 60 minute length as players go up and down in the points with buildings of the same size being built over for no actual progress on the board. A player perceived to be ahead of the others is picked on viciously with the pirate (roll of seven). To get the last couple of points cubes down can take as long as an hour where you're just lucky the others hold off rolling sevens for a bit and don't put a further dent in your score. Did I mention I don't think this should be played with four?! It could be an okay three player game, but I'll need a few good plays and a knock on the head to erase the memory of the night (all three hours), I played with four.

This is suposed to be [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13]Catan[/url][/i] upgraded, but the only thing that shares with that game is the name in the box.  It feels so different in so many ways.  The posibility of interaction increases giving the game a great twist.  Players produce, build and rebuild over already constructed buildings to get points, while they try to avoid pirats.  Sometimes, during three players games, the flow of play just blocked itself.  When it happens, everybody is just waiting for the right cards to perform their winning combo and couldn't do anything else without putting their game in danger.  So they all sit until luck and probabilities do their job.  Nevertheless, if this doesn't happen, the game leads to exciting close cutthroating endings.

Played for the first time tonight (12/27/06). Didn't like it much. Like Settlers, it's very possible to get screwed by the dice. I was very unlucky in the beginning, very lucky in the middle, and very unlucky at the end. As a result, I was very near winning but I was not able to get the resources I needed to finish. Another player was terribly unlucky for most of the game, and finally started getting some rolls his way near the end. The player who was luckiest all the way through was the one who won. He won mostly because he built 6 wall segments in the cheap section of wall, and then built 5 of the 9 Church tiles, which he could do because he constantly received income.

Elasund --  Played 3-player and 4-player.  I'm not big on area control games like [i]Go[/i] or [i]Kahuna[/i], so I feared that the ebb and flow of building displacement might be a problem for me.  Not so.  Even when I can't do what I want, there's almost always [b][i]something[/i][/b] I can do.  The games have been tight.  The final rounds have been either a race to get the last point or two, or an effort to reduce the leader's points just long enough to surpass him, [i]or[/i] to [b]take[/b] the leader's points!

A game that's very unlike its predecessors. There's some core Catan mechanics here, but the gameplay is very different from just about anything else Teuber has done. Lots of strategy, lots of tactics. A little dry.

Another in the Catan family: a city building game with the usual Catan tricks. Dice rolling to activate resource production. First to 10vps win.

The trading aspect is removed and instead players are given the option to be 'nasty' and cause alot of havoc and damage with building and pirate placement.

Starts off pretty light and easy but gets tense towards the end when the board gets filled up. Easy turn order which shouldn't lead to too much downtime.

This turned out to be surprisingly enjoyable.  I really didn't like the first of the series (Candamir), but this had a nice resource management with a fun sense of building the city up with whatever you can scrape together.  I think that perhaps the leader will have an easier time keeping their lead if everyone doesn't try to chip away at them, but I don't mind a little of that in my games.  As usual the catan luck can get a bit agregious, but overall this is a lovely system.  I found the claims on plots to be a fun new twist on area control.  I'm absolutely looking forward to trying this again.

A great game, actually. The luck factor sometimes decides games (e.g. if I get to build on the 6-8 space on the first turn, and you roll a 3, you will need lots of luck later on). However, it does require a great deal of skill, the conflict is vicious, and even production values in the Russian version aren't that bad. A great game; I'd never turn it down.

RATING: 6.5
This is not "just another Settlers"! There is still dice rolling, resource accumulation, and building but it is all done a bit differently. Like Anno 1503, there's no trading with other players. But the game is "meaner" than the other variants - you can build over (i.e., DESTROY!) other players' buildings, or use some of their resources (building permits) without their permission. You can still target several players with the pirate, and potentially get even more of their resources for yourself. And you can try to play defensively to minimize what damage others can do to you. (You still can't make the dice roll what you want, though).

I like this variant, although not quite enough to spend $$ on it (but maybe GG...). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This game did NOT resonate with me at all. The dice felt like they were only there to make people draw the connection with Catan, which was contrived, and the constant destroying of buildings was just... weird.

Based on the Catan theme, this does have the element of luck Settlers has because of the dice roll.  There are, however, interesting game play elements that make the game interesting, not too heavy, and a good game to introduce non-gamers to.  There is no trading among players as in Settlers and there are opportunities to mess with other players by building over their buildings.

Две первые игры на двоих оставили очень приятное впечатление: прямая конкуренция между игроками ощущается очень хорошо, механика позволяет разными путями добиваться победы, а темп не дает скучать. Впрочем, мне показалось, что игра втроем или вчетвером будет интереснее - вместо борьбы лоб в лоб придется взаимодействовать с несколькими игроками, бороться за лидерство.  
Определенно хочу сыграть ещё.
[b]5.05[/b] Ещё две партии, рейтинг возрос до [b]7.5[/b]! При игре втроем и вчетвером получаются очень напряженные, по-хорошему агрессивные партии с евро-конкуренцией: стратегия определенно имеет значение, но вырваться вперед далеко нельзя и победить до последнего могут несколько игроков. Впрочем, в партии на 4 был замечен эффект, когда ставший с самого начала аутсайдером игрок так и не смог догнать лидеров - впрочем, возможно сказался недостаток опыта игры.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
[Kosmos 'Elasund Die erste Stadt' 2005 edition] {Catan, city-building; dice-rolling, tile-laying; scalable} Unlike traditional Catan games, it is more strategic: deeper, multifaceted, less random and more brutal from direct competition. Similar to Catan games: it's thematic, fun and enjoyable. (However, I think the theme is weaker than original Settlers.)  The idea of building permit is very special and allows various tactics and negotiation.  The variety of resources is narrower than ordinary Catan games - only 3 kinds of resources have to be maintained but it's still brain-burring.

It's quite different from traditional Euro games that buildings can be destroyed after they are built. It doesn't have the strong development feature of Catan but it eliminates the run-away leader problem. It's a gamers' game; I don't think it's very suitable for families.

The game system is nicely balanced. Players opting for a particular strategic move have to sacrifice other things. No single strategic prevail esp. when playing with a group of experienced players. I really like the system.

[Expansion tiles] I made the expansion tiles myself. I look forward to playing the game with these tiles.

[Rule clarification] The cards are selected (not picked randomly) during a thief!

RATING: 8
Settlers style income generation, but with more options to manage the probabilities. Much greater scope to hit your opponents & reduce their VP. I like the "building permits" that signpost your building moves, and the way they facilitate bluff, threats & defensive play. Excellent with 2 players.

Games can become very tightly contested - I've had one 4-player game where the wall was completed, most buildings were down and all players were jockeying for position (& denying others) for the final couple of points. Lots of smack-the-leader. In that game people seemed very cash-poor and little church building occured. That game lasted 2.5 hours

Elasund is a good game that's a lateral step for the Catan franchise. It's easy too grasp, fun to play, and a pleasant way to spend an hour with the family. I'd say it's as fun as the Settlers base game. What it loses by not having any interplayer trading, it makes up for through the mechanics of placing and using Building Permits. This opens the avenue for some aggressive play and the occasional "Arrgh! How did I not see that?" moment. Recommended.

I like the "take that" factor in this game, but the die rolling makes this game too random for my taste. You can plan, but not enough, because your resources depend on the die. Placing your own buildings on top of someone else's is nice though. Score while screwing your neighbour, that's what I call a game. The scoring system is interesting, since you can also lose gained points and move back.

This is a fairly cut-throat game, which is not unheard of from Klaus Teuber (the excellent Lowenherz is an example).

The die rolling for resources is reminiscent of Settlers, which for me is a good thing.

I know I should've liked this a lot more but for some reason I didn't. I could be because I was shut out of game as a result of my own poor play but nonetheless I blame the dice - there might be too much luck involved for me to enjoy Elasund. Still, it's manages to be a new take on Catan which is a big plus. Mechanics work fine, except for the dice.

RATING: 7
A clever tile-laying game with lots of scope - there's so many things to do and so many ways to do them that it can get a bit confusing at times! The overall result is a good (and, based on our first play, a very even) brain-burner of a game that suffers from the same grave handicap as original Catan; it's waaay too long for what it delivers. (No wonder this game is now appearing for 2nd hand sale in such quantities as it is; a lot of the people who bought this, thinking it will be an easy family game a la Catan, must be seriously disappointed! Thus, a weak 7 instead of an 8.)

It's hard not to compare it to Settlers, even though it is quite different.  It certainly is a more complex/deeper and cutthroat game than Settlers, but it lacks the trading/haggling and simple elegance (or elegant simplicity) of its ancestor.  It's hard for me to say which I prefer, but Elasund has the big advantage of playing quite well with 2 and 3 as well as 4, while I think Settlers works significantly better with 4 than with 3.

Its a neat game that really isn't my cup of tea.  I've only played once, and I'm sure I'll play more.  The game just didn't strike me as dynamic.  It just seemed to move slowly as everybody progresses at roughly the same rate.  Rating could change with more play.   Leader bashing is the only viable strategy.  The game isn't cutthroat at all. 

Turn 7 on.   Player B needs a building.  Player  C is winning.  Player B does not have room on the map to place the building without stepping on any toes.  So player B invariably builds his building over top Player C's existing building. Hope for beneficial die rolls. Rinse repeat.

A new, different game from Klaus Teuber.  Not the same as Catan, but similar, with some cutthroat play.  See my review for details...

Played several times with various numbers of players - I found all games to be fairly dull.  Yes, the building permit system is mildly interesting, but the way some people go on about the player interaction baffles me - it's good here by comparison to Candamir, but not by comparison to most other games I've played recently (there's interaction in Elasund, but not enough of it, and it's pretty crude).

Despite the considerable luck element (comparable to Settlers), I had fun playing this with three players. It falls into the same family oriented category as Settlers, but absence of trading and the possibility of destroying your neighbours' buildings make it feel like a different experience. Anno 2010, I think I like it just a bit better than the old classic.

Definitely a very luck based game. What do I expect? It's a Catan game. Still, the game is cut throat and quite intense. I also find the permit concept to be a little fiddly.Not as much with two players though, it is a tad boring. Much rather play Carcassonne. Take it or leave it

O.K.  I've gotten a real game of this finished now, so I have a more reasonable assesment.  This can be a nasty game, and it is certainly a little more rules heavy than I would normally expect from a Catan game, but that is just fine.  It stands well on its own, and has lots of possibilities to think about.  I wonder what the fans who expect every Catan game to be light, family fare will think of it?

[played 2 player only] Fairly confrontational. Luck plays an important role, but it doesn't bother me in this game.

RATING: 5
Better than you'd expect for the sequel to the game based on the novelization of a popular boardgame franchise, but still not my cup of tea. I rather liked the building permits mechanic (and wish it was distilled into a shorter and simpler game), but there was too much other extraneous stuff that didn't gel for me. The main problem is that as a whole it just doesn't fully scratch any of my numerous itches, thematically or mechanically.

RATING: 7
First game left me good feeling. It is very nice building game and very different compared to any Catan-successors. But end game can be problematic in certain situations especially when all players concentrate wind mills and normal buildings. In worst case it can really drag. This game probably works very well with two players.

Better than Settlers of Catan but not quite my kind of game. I have more enjoyable games to fill a two hour slot. And yes, it does take about two hours. One thing that does bother me is the pacing of the game. It is a slow start but even though it picks up speed later on, it just doesn't feel quite right.

RATING: 5
Explaining the rules and figuring them out seems to take too long compared to game content itself. First game took two hours, which a little bit too long, but probably gets quicker with experience.

Rated after two games, still the explaining the rules and all the options takes time. The structure of the rulebook might be one reason, now it seems that there are endless number of options for each turn. Settlers of Catan has lots of interaction, this has not.

You know, this game finally made me realize that I simply don't like settler's like resource gathering. You know sometimes, even though you play the odds, you just get screwed? Well you know... I'm tired of that. Many times you can have fun with these types of games, but when it goes bad... it's painful for me. I hate it. I can't give this a good review, because my last game of it was the worst time I've had playing a game in over a year. Dreadful time - even though I realize it isn't really the games fault but luck. Well - it is the game's fault for allowing the chance for luck to make my life miserable for 1.5 hours.

Rating after 1 play: Interesting mechanics that in theory you'd think would make for a nice medium-to-heavy-weight game but in practice I was bored. Just like all other version of Catan that aren't the base game: it drags on too long for what it is. I might try this again if there weren't any other good choices but I would never ask to play it myself.

Definitely hoped for more differentiation in building effects...I think the free expansion is a must.  There are a lot of neat things going on here, and it's not really *that* nasty, as you have to provide compensation all the time (which I think is a feature).  But there was no spark, no distinctly interesting mechanism.

Has some interesting spatial play with the bidding tokens and building over other buildings. It was fun enough as a 2p, but I think it's really a 3p+ game, so really want to try it with 3 or 4.

Very nice sequel to Settlers of Catan, using dice in another unique way.  Klaus Teuber is really a great designer, and I recommend this one.  It works very nicely with 2 players or more.  There is an interesting balance between collecting cash and influence, and good tension in the fight for good placement of building permits.  All round a great design.

purchased 23 03 06. first 4 player game was 2.5 hours in length. I think being the first game and with a bit of paralysis among players meant we had a slow game. Quite enjoyeable, but I think windmills are very strong and also you must be agressive against the leader and their destroy buildings. Quite a good first game, but not for sensitive souls. Although having played it has a 4 player the first time..i've played it as a 2 player a few times now and like it better.
UPDATE: rarely sees the table. poss trade
Update 230109 Played again (at last) as a 2er..very enjoyable..a bit ruthless but a hit all the same..

Played numerous times (with 2 to 4 players). Probably the best Teuber game for a long time. The randomness factor is fairly low, the interaction between players is direct and quite tense, and overall the game is an enjoyable race to get rid of VP cubes. After several plays with 4 players, I tried it with 2 and 3, and the game works as well.

I like this one quite a bit, and feel it got a little overshadowed by others that released around the same time. The presentation is attractive, t scales very nicely for the various numbers of players, and the roll for resources mechanic moderates the runs of numbers effect. This doesn't have the trading aspect of classic Catan, so may not appeal to all fans of that game. However, it allows for more direct interference between players, which adds an interesting element.

Wow, I was really surprised by this one!  I spent the complete last night playing it (1 hour each game)! A good strategy is much more important than simple dicer-luck. Just played it as two player game and I am looking forward to test it with 3 and 4 players. Conclusion: Very very good game!!!

Some vicious, confrontational elements, but a nice strategy game. Only semblance to any other Catan is the 2d6 resource roll, with something "bad" happening on a 7. For its length, however, there's still just a bit too much luck to be a serious contender as a strategy game to form an evening around.

Another mean Tueber game.  Why can't we get along???  This game is fun, but like settlers, it can be heavily luck dependent.  If the dice gods hate you, it becomes tough to win.  Don't play this with anyone who takes games personally because the best way to win is to build over/destroy their stuff.

I really had high hopes for this game, but all I can think about when I play it is how much I'd rather be playing Blue Moon City.  Elasund is certainly not a bad game at all, but it lacks a special something to make it great.

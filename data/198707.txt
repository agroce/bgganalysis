After five games, easy to learn. Very difficult which isn’t a bad thing. The dice do feel like they work against you so keeping extra cards or a “consider this” seems a necessary strategy. 

Glad hostage negotiating isn’t my real life job...  hostages die on my watch. :p


Will revisit rating after more games.

Everything about this game is so impressive.  Much like how the Wizard's Tower and On The Brink expansions boosted Castle Panic and Pandemic from good to great games, I can now add Crime Wave to that list.

Everything, and I mean everything, is better in this version and is not only 100% compatible with the base game, the box is designed to store the freaking base game box inside it in case you want easy access to a more portable version.

On top of all that, the game itself is stellar.  Crime Wave's additional abductors are unique and tough.  Couldn't be happier.

This is the best solo experience I've had in a long time!  Just played my first game of it against the recommended Abductor for the first game.  Having had experience with the first Hostage Negotiator and the 4 Abductor packs for it, I still lost my first game!

It was close, but she ended up escaping right at the last minute!  It was fantastic from start to finish and I can't wait to see what new elements the other Abductors bring to the table in future games!

Absolutely love LOVE this game. Right up there with "Friday" as far as solo games goes. If you've tried it and think it's all about luck then you're doing it wrong. It for sure has a steep learning curve but it's very satisfying when you do figure it out.

I found this game to be 'ok' - it may be that solo gaming isn't for me, or perhaps I'm just not as in love with dice rolling as I thought I was, but this game just didn't seem to add enough in terms of theme or flavour to justify all the extra components.

Fantastic solo game. Very thematic and addictive. Love all the expansions to date and the only 'meh' element (small box) was rectified with this new upgrade. So much content and so much obvious fan-based love and attention to detail has gone into this. Awesome. I love all my Van Ryder games.

I was able to playtest this and the upcoming abductor packs and I am REALLY looking forward to getting the production version of both.  I love the system that AJ has created and totally enjoy watching it grow and expand.  The game is a fast and tense solo experience that shouldn't be missed.  AND - the upcoming (2018?) Career expansion will connect consecutive abductor matches into a campaign with between match decisions and consequences. Perfect.

Will play this over the original Hostage Negotiator every time. The conversation cards are a lot better thought out an the base game abductors are much more varied than in the original game. Much less random than the original. Plays in 10 minutes. Top solo game.

Didn't  quite set the cards in the box as they said to as full game has too much /or not enough cards for some of the slots.
The box is huge though, which is fine when you have everything (has space for the next expansion too), and ordering the cards with the separators will surely speed up setup (one thing i disliked with the original).

Have everything + meeples + secret envelope.
Need to play it more (and the base too)

Well, yeah, the game is good and more stuff is allways better, isn't it? And it kinda is, allowing even sime limited deck building for the conversation deck. It is fun, the new abductors add nice twists and the big box keeps all the stuff in one place. Still mostly fuelled by randomness combined with bad luck, but that feels strangely thematic in this game.

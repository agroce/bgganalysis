A train game in disguise, at an exceptionally reasonable price.  Very clever, though it takes a while to learn the board.  If you aren't careful you can get snaked for a route that you were planning on grabbing.  Well balanced and very expandable, though I can see downtime becoming a problem with 5 or 6.  Cash can be tight, but the business expansion helps the cash flow.

So this game was randomly introduced to me by another gaming buddy. When he was laying it out, he quickly compared it to ticket to ride... and honestly, I kind of wanted to tell him to put it away. Don't get me wrong, I think TTR is a good game for certain people; but I find it repetitive and boring. But after I played this game, I purchased my own copy.

Why? Because this is not like TTR. Granted, it is a simple route-building game... but it has an economic engine building aspect where players must decide when to build routes that give them income and when to build routes that give them VP. In many ways, it is more similar to a game like Saint Petersburg, but with a strong spatial element to it. And the money in this game is tight and every decision matters... feels very brain burning and tense.

Horrible box artwork (the board itself is excellent). I suspect it's better with more players. But overall, very good game.

Some compare this to Ticket to Ride, but there is more to think about in this one. I would say this is one or two notches deeper than TTR and is more fun. I can't imagine playing it with more than three, but the box says it plays six. I would recommend three for your first play. Then you can go crazy with more. 

Update: Played with 5. It slows down a little, but is still a fun game. I'm surprised.

Below Meh. Confusing map, my four player game seemed to be a fight mostly agains the map design and strange routing possibilities (why, edinburg is closer to lisbon than madrid is to dublin: frankfurt is not connected to berlin, etc). Card draw factor was huge (hey, a route opened where I had my planes set up, thanks!) but thankfully it didn't seem to ruin a good game: it just turned a mediocre game into a bad one.

RATING: 8
Enjoyable game of route-building and economic efficiency.  I admit that there is a large luck factor in the cards (routes) that come out, but so far I have not found it to be a big issue.  Since your final, multi-stop ticket cannot use the same route twice, there is a puzzle element to the game.  After wrapping my head around the economic engine, I still like this one a lot.

UPDATE 2014: I still like it, but I'm not convinced you can win without doing the final flight unless you are very lucky with routes and extremely efficient with cash.  I want to try with the expansions, but my friends' don't like the base game as much as I do.

RATING: 8.5
Your striding along and pass through Jet fuel like barely perceptable cobswebs, asn you notice that you just might have a chance to make a connection.


Be it buy or build you will be setting up routes that let you get flgith cards for points.  The cards will be coming to your oppponets on various routes but you need to just barely edge them out to win the ultimate destination...

Victory!

A little bit of screwage a lot of not being able to always accomplish exactly what you wanted to do keep you on edge as you try to win as many successful flgihts as you can.

There are a set of different economies in this game so you have to balance you singular action each turn to idealize the overall flow in your direction.

great game plays in 75-90 minutes.

It's much like Ticket to Ride, but with a little less "screw your neighbor" aspect and a little more "think-y". This went over well with my more gamer friends, but I think it might be too much for my family to like. I do like how money is pretty tight, and the game seems to keep competition pretty close.

Rating based on one 4-player game at BGG.CON '08.  Nice little train-like game, should be accessible to gamers looking for the next step beyond gateway games as well -- with the huge caveat that it's possible to make a mistake early on that all but eliminates you from contention.

The unfortunate "90s clip art" look, gaudy colors, and generally awful graphic design really do a disservice for this great family-weight-plus™ game. This takes the route-building of Ticket to Ride and adds an interesting currency mechanic that makes timing your routes (and competition over who gets there first) all the more critical and stressful. When combined with the expansions, this really kicks TtR up a notch in complexity and weight. Too bad this will turn off so many people with its sad, dated appearance.

A nice connection game with a bit of a money management aspect thrown in.  Overall, I liked it pretty well, although I was hoping there would be more of having to pay to use other peoples' connections as well as getting paid as other people use yours.  Maybe it was just a product of only playing it with 4, and it would be a little more interesting with more.  I liked the tightness of the finances, as you really had to make every move count!

I understand why some people claim it’s like Ticket to Ride and Airlines Europe, but I don’t think it’s very accurate. Sure there are route connections which you get points for, and each round is very easy as you only do 1 out of 5 possible actions, so in that sense it’s like Ticket to Ride. But Jet Set is much more focused on the economic aspect of your airline routes, and the economy is tight in this game. I like that you have an endgame secret mission card which can net you a lot of points, but you still need to build routes depending on the available cards. And if you don’t like the cards, you can pay for adding further cards (or speeding up the game as you can reveal more cards so the vacation cards show up earlier; when two of them are revealed, you can play your endgame card and rush the game-end before other players are done completing their missions and getting aircrafts on the board.

I haven’t played it with higher player counts, meaning that the interaction hasn’t been too big as we rarely put planes on each other’s routes as the board was too open. Would love to try it with 6.

This game is just the right length as a filler.  It worked well as a 4&5 player game I hope it works as a 3 player game.

NB
I'm becomming aware that abstract games are not my taste and this refects in my opinion of many games).  The theme on many simple games are painted on to level I find difficult.

Games in this grouping:
Taluva
Lost Cities
Bohanza
Jet Set
Junta

Naval War

Some more complex game have a level of abstration that does not meet my expectation for the theme/subject etc.  This makes the game a less compelling experience.

Games in this grouping:
Elder Signs
Reef Encounter
Modern Naval Battles
The Fury of Dracula

My enthusiasm for these games is limited by a level of abstraction that challenges my taste and my rating reflects this.

I don't say it often, but I consider this game to be a true hidden gem.  I've heard Airlines Europe frequently mentioned as the next step up from Ticket To Ride, but I disagree.  Jet Set is about building routes to score points and the logical successor to TtR.  You claim the route cards [b]after[/b] you build the routes in Jet Set, but you actually [b]own[/b] the links between cities.  Airlines Europe is excellent, but you're building out shared routes to make them more valuable to everyone.  You still need to have the stocks for said routes, and that's what that game is mostly about.

Jet Set feels more satisfying [b]as[/b] you play, because you are often working to build up shorter routes into longer ones.  The only problem I see is in the luck of the draw.  If 3, 5, or 7 point cards come out early that include the initial 1 point routes you claimed, then you are in luck.  If not, you have to build more small routes elsewhere and start building up again.  This could lead to a player falling behind and unable to catch up.  I think this could be solved by some of the expansion modules that allow for other point scoring opportunities.  Super fun and a KEEPER!

Provisional rating after one play.  Great route-building game that feels like the next step beyond Ticket to Ride.  Build smaller routes in order to generate enough income to afford to build larger routes and to eventually complete your final flight ticket.  Luck of the card draw feels like a factor early, especially when none of the initial routes are any you're interested in, but as the game goes along that doesn't seem to have as great an effect as it initially seems.  Money is always tight, though, so it feels like there's a constant need to spend a turn generating income.  Very fun game -- watch out for the AP with those that are prone to it.

Nothing like Ticket to Ride, gee, just because it has routes is like saying an apple and cherry are the same thing because they are both red. 

This game is income driven via of the Flight Cards you must take via of building a flight link or links. You must get 1 or 2 of these low rank 1 link Flight cards at the start of the game. If not, you will be locked out of most of the game because this is your only source of income in the base game. The points on the Flight cards are also the only source for victory points to winning, the expansion adds a few ways to score points. Played with the expansion, all info is public except the Business cards. It is easy to see who is winning. There is luck in the cards in the Business cards as they are drawn one at a time as a perk for a long route. The long and short routes used in the face up draw pile can be added to via of a 1 Euro payment up to the max limit, this helps with the luck in drawing them, in a 4 player game the upper limit is 8 cards per row. I don't find it as enjoyable as Ticket to Ride, I wouldn't play without the expansion as money is too tight in the base game, I could take or leave that Distant Lands part of the expansion, that thing is only for group that plays the crap out of the game. I would say this game appeals more to the Euro fanboys who dislike Ticket to Ride, aka the hand held rummy like game play. I would prefer to play Ticket to Ride Marklin or Airlines Europes over this. Jet Set isn't a bad game, with only one Final Flight card held in your hand there just isn't too many surprises as who the winner is going to be as most people get the bonus flight done. If you don't get that card played you will lose.

I played this last weekend and have no desire to repeat the experience. Only one action per turn made it far too pedestrian. It didn't take long until I was pretty bored, so I finished my final flight and then tried to force the second vacation card by drawing more short route cards. This worked and I was immediately able to play my final flight, starting the countdown.

The fact that this also won me the game did not improve my opinion of it.

Spend money to place your airplanes on key air-links between cities. The first to place an airplane on a link gains cheaper rights, but other players can still use the link for a price. A number of flight cards are on display; a player can claim one after connecting the two cities shown. Longer flights are worth more points, but the short flights are easier and less expensive to achieve, and they bring in just as much income as the long flights. At the end, it's urgent to get your secret Final Flight done, connecting three cities. The winner is the player with the most valuable collection of flights achieved, including bonuses for finishing the Final Flight sooner.

People mention similarities to Ticket To Ride -- this is actually the opposite: instead of collecting cards to use to acquire routes on the board that score points, here you buy routes on the board to use to acquire cards that score points.  It's much more of a brain-burner, even though the rules are not complex at all.  Expect the first game to run longer than you think it will. However, it's well worth the effort.  I really had fun with this, even when it made my brain ache.

Our two-player games suggest that, good as it is, the game will be better with more players, chiefly because of the need to use others' links. (Only about 2 or 3 times has either player needed to do that in each of our games.) Also, with only one action per turn, downtime should not be an issue, even with six players.

This is a wonderful train game, with aeroplanes. It has gone almost completely unnoticed, but it is a very neat connection and economy game with very simple rules. Yes, it is a bit light(ish) and a little luck dependent, but it is as good a game in its genre as I can think of. It is never dull, it has quite some tension, it is short and it is fun.  Throw away your Ticket to Rides and play Jet Set.

Horrible experience playing this game.  You can get locked out of the game in the first few turns and literally do nothing meaningful for the next 1.5 hours.  The game should start with each player being assigned 2 random "1 routes".  Otherwise the start player has a *huge* advantage in being able to select the best 1 routes.  Also, the first player (in a 3er game) will be in the best spot to refill the card row, to get first dibs on the best new routes.  I'm not willing to play this game again with the current rule set...borderline broken.

Players are air barons, trying to take over lucrative air links in Europe for victory points.  Nice, tight fast playing game where players have to quickly develop an income stream. Money is spent on developing an airline infrastructure via aircraft on the map.  Aircraft are removed to claim a route card, which are worth victory points. A bit of a brain burner initially, but quickly moves on to a fast playing economy/route planning game. Nice surprise.

I see the TtR comparison, but there's a little more going on here as you plan and spend your actions.   I'm not crazy about the ability for players to pace the game by the connections they select.

We played with the Jet Set: Distant Lands – Expansion Set 1 expansion. If Jet Set were an hour then it would be a reasonably good game. But at two and a half hours it is too long for what it is.

You build routes, you fulfil tickets, you get income, you gain points. All the ingredients of a good route game are here. A major positive is that you only take one quick action on your turn so there is little downtime. The downsides are the game length and the luck of the tickets which come out, especially toward the game end where they will often closely match one player’s built air routes.

If you want to play a route building game which moves on from Ticket To Ride I would recommend Canal Mania over Jet Set. Despite its similar game length Canal Mania has more depth and opportunities for strategy.

Mildly interesting game of route building with an economic aspect included.  Players must choose between long term goals (victory points) and short term goals (income).

Unique twist on the route connection genre.  I really enjoy the money management aspect of the game but find myself struggling with the components and artwork.  Too much time is spent trying to find cities on the board and unraveling the paths that connect them. In addition, the cheap plastic route ownership markers do a poor job of distinguishing themselves at a quick glance.  One player commented that interaction is quite minimal since there's no way to block or effectively impair your opponent's plans.  There’s no doubt my rating would be higher with a cleaner, more utilitarian board, and some additional hindrance mechanic.

[1 play] Certainly more enjoyable than I expected of a game about air travel!  This at least gave me the feeling of "I want to play this again now that I know how."

This was my third play and the start player won again. Not surprised as this is a known weakness of the game.. How is there no turn order mitigation? Maybe some extra money or something? 

In any case, the luck of the draw for how routes come out will determine the winner among equally skilled players. You all need to go after 1 routes to build up an income (if not, you will fall hopelessly behind), and whoever gets 1 routes that dovetail into their endgame strategy will compete for victory; the other players are just taking up space at the table.

Because of the very limited money it feels like it's a much harder game than it really is. And the first person to get to the final flight pretty much wins the game so anything else is just a distraction. I prefer Airlines Europe: the boards and general theme are similar, but they don't have much more in common. I want to play it a few more times with some of the expansions before I determine my copy's fate.

Played 2 games. First one was a disaster for me, because noone warned me about the tight resources. Second game did run really fast, and I had after that a feeling of disappointment. There doesn´t seem to be any interaction between players. You just take care of your own main route and completely ignore the other players, until someone declares that he has completed his...

This is a connection game, similar to Ticket to Ride. However, the use of destination tickets is done differently, and there is no set collection mechanism. Rather, it's all about developing income and using it to build your business, similar to Railroad Tycoon. It's way more fun than the former, not as deep or good as the latter, but overall it's a very good game.

EDIT - After a couple more plays, this has moved into "9" land for me. I very much like the mix of economics and connections. It's hard to generate enough cash to do everything you want. It's also hard to get all the routes you want. That forces a fair number of decisions about how to best utilize limited cash - go for more flight cards and risk not making your final flight soon enough? Focus on the final flight, hope you claim it first and have enough of a bonus to win? Nice game.

A surprise find from Essen 2008; this game is about setting up flights between European cities to gain income.  A really fun network-building game which can be enjoyed as a heavy game or lighter fare.

With the exception of one player in the group so far, this game has gone down really well.  The game gets particularly competitive at times, and despite concerns that it is fairly easy for one player to gamble on possible flight card availability, I can see a lot of plays in future for this game.

RATING: 6
In Jet Set players connect flight routes in order to score route tickets. This overly short desription makes it sound somewhat similar to Ticket to Ride, except for the use of airplanes instead of trains, but it plays out rather differently, mainly due to the tickets coming from a shared display and having to pay for building routes with money.

The first player able to complete a route can claim the corresponding ticket. Tickets score victory points but they are also immediately useful in that they produce income. Since money is very tight owning a number of low-scoring short routes is still very valuable.

The luck of the draw when new tickets are revealed can have quite an impact, and due to the way income generation works, once you've fallen behind (which is very easy to do in your first game if you're not prepared for the extreme shortage of funds) it's almost impossible to come back.

This game crawls along in a tedious, incremental fashion. I'm not sure I see very many meaningful choices here, either. Since you only go through a portion of the deck, the luck of the routes that are available are going to determine the winner. And the first player has a very obvious advantage.

I think it will have to be Jet Set. An interesting economical route building game. Although I only rated it a 7.0, it might go up with a few more plays. It was actually a bit to grasp right from the git go what would be the best and it seemed a bit unforgiving. Although, that might also mean that it might have limited options after repeated play. I'll have to play to find out though.

This looks like TICKET TO RIDE at first blush the TTR comps are more cosmetic and thematic - both games involve travel and planning routes, and use cards to depict different city-to-city itineraries which score VP's if completed.

But JET SET is a deeper game. It's more economic, and more punishing if one is inefficient. 

On the family tree it's much closer to STEAM. But more focused and streamlined. It's less gateway and family-friendly than TTR.  Definitely a gamer's game. 

It's medium-to-heavy, unforgiving if you don't budget or pre-plan correctly, and subject to analysis paralysis - especially at the endgame when you're looking for the best final VP closing moves.

If you like STEAM, this is a fun distillation of some of that game's mechanics.

Comment based on one play.

This has been described as "Ticket to Ride", but with airliners! Yes, it is route building, but the similarities end there. There is no need to collect sets of cards to claim a link; you simply pay money to claim it. Instead, the game revolves around route cards, similar to the destination cards in TTR. Once a plane, or series of planes are placed on links, connecting the two cities on a route card, the player can claim the card for victory points--the harder and farther the cities, the more points. However, each route can then generate $5 of income, at most three times, and only for the first five claimed routes (thereafter, it generates $5 twice). It then generates $2 of residual income for the rest of the game.

The decision tree is pretty simple: 1) claim a link and place an airplane; 2) place X number of planes on Y number of your links; 3) place X number of planes on an single opponent's link; 4) claim a route card; 5) generate income from your routes; or 6) claim your objective route card (which triggers the game end, but only after the second "vacation" card has been drawn from the two route decks). I was initially confused, and had to "unlearn" everything about TTR--"You can simply claim a link? How absurd!" Well, of course you have to be able to pay for it. While the longer routes give you more VP, they generate the same income as the shorter routes. And since it costs a lot of money to put the planes onto the board, one will need to take a turn to generate income. The depreciating route income mechanic is novel--generate high income for three income turns, which forces one to establish other shorter connections to generate more income, as that route then only offers residuals. However, these connections should figure into your longer-term plans of completing one of your two secret objective routes, similar to the secret destination cards in RRT. All in all, a very enjoyable and fast-paced game. With three, the board seems too open, but I've heard the sweet spot is four. Five or six could be cramped, and slow down the game, but this would be worth a try again with more players. Initial rating "8".

Update (02/18/2012) 3 plays: Having obtained my own copy, finally played a 5 player game. It didn't seem cramped, as the competition for routes was just right. Downtime was minimal, since money was tight, making the decisions easier--get more income! Everyone agreed that it was an enjoyable game, and they all want to play it again. Everyone was equally impressed that there was so much game for so simple of rules, resulting in gameplay that is challenging and intense. Yes, grabbing routes is easy--you just have to have the money to buy the route--but it is best if it falls into your long-range plans.

All in all, the components are wonderful, especially the miniature jets! The player aids are very helpful and functional. The rules need a bit streamlining and are hard to read at first glance, but still pretty good as rulebooks go.

So, despite its light theme and ruleset, this is one meaty game with plenty of chewy, difficult decisions, both tactical and strategic. Turns are quick, so 5-6 player games don't see much downtime. Still, the game takes time to develop, so it clocks in at around two hours. Rating is still an "8", with possibility of climbing to a "9".

Update (12/04/2014) 9 plays: there was a two-year period where the game was poo-pooed by some in my group, but after a few recent plays, it is starting to see the table more often and with enthusiasm. What has become apparent is that going for high-income early means a less "base points", when the final flights (and game end) get triggered. Someone with less income, but more base points will win the game if they trigger final flight first. Someone with less base points will win the game if they trigger final flight first also, if they catch the others unaware--it is a matter of timing, which is subtle art in this game. It is still a good, solid game, staying steady at an "8". I think this is as high as it will go for this game, and that is not a bad thing, as it has lots of staying power.

Looks like Airlines Europe, but is NOTHING like it. A very tight money game about making connections between cities. Usually we play with 6 players. The board gets crowded, but still works. Eventually there is a chain of players paying other players to use their routes.

Completing your final flight as soon as possible *generally* seems to be the key to winning. While the other players get 5 more turns when end game is triggered, completing final flight gives you 2 points per turn of doing nothing. It's really hard to beat that.

See, you would think I would like this because it fixes some of the things I complain about with Ticket to Ride (futility) and adds some elements that I enjoy (economy) while retaining the interesting connection stuff.  But the game was far longer than it was interesting, the endgame is messy and anticlimactic, and the ugly, boring board didn't help.  Also, it became obvious about halfway through who would win. Meh.  (1 play)

interesting game... seem comparisions to ticket to ride in reverse but while I see the comparision (you do claim routes after having claimed "track"), it's really a much different game.

Plays just okay.  Money is so tight, it would be nice if players started the game with about twice as much.  The mechanisms in the game are pretty smooth, but overall it didn't make we want to rush out and buy my very own copy.  I think the main problem is there are between 12 and 24 routes to consider, evaluate and compare.  That's an awful lot of planning, which can still be undone by someone taking a chosen card before you can.

In the same family as Ticket to Ride, but with income management instead of set collection at its core.  It's a good, competitive, and tense game with the full six-person complement.  It takes 90-120 minutes with six.  A good choice for someone who likes Ticket to Ride, but wants the next level of thinking and complexity.

Three things keep me from rating it higher: (1) it takes a long time to execute a plan because your actions are so limited on a turn, so every third turn takes lots of thought, but then the next two are automatic; (2) it requires lots of staring at cards and comparing them to the board and lots more counting and comparing costs; and (3) the amount of luck engendered through initial and later card pulls is a bit high for a more gamer-y and calculational game.

You buy links and put planes on them to complete
route tickets. The completed routes earn you money.
You can put more planes on your routes, or other
people's routes.

But the first players had an immense advantage.
I went last and the first 3 routes I won were
so out of the way that on one every traveled
on them. The first two players took 2nd and 1st

Initial rating: 7. Played once with 6 players and that was clearly too many. All where new and some even new gamers, so there was some confusion as to how to play the final flight card that ruined the experience a little. That is why I dont like to play semi-complex 6 player games, not everyone will listen carefully when you explain the rules, even if you highlight one aspect several times. Other than that I wish there would have been more interaction. Might come with more plays if I decide to keep it. Liked that the money was tight and that the map mattered (compared to Arilines Europe). But with this complexity I think I would rather play Steam or Suburbia (both economic games that I have enjoyed more)

RATING: 6
I like connection-building games and pick-up-and-deliver. This game is a purebreed in these categories, consisting of very basic steps of claiming connections, buying planes for those connections, and spending those planes to claim route cards for money and points. That's the entire game right there. My issue with the game is that it isn't enough. There are better games in the genre that give you more to think about and I'd rather play those. This game feels like a deliberate attempt to have an economic route-building game without auctions.

While the game is far from terrible, here are the weaknesses as I see them:
- You only have one action per turn. While this means the turns go quickly (good), there is a lack of challenging options on your turn. You spend the entire game comparing route cards and your Final Flight cards to build routes that will get the most re-use. Once you decide what that is, you pretty much know what you are going to do. Sometimes you need to adjust because of the available cards or other player's actions, but the best adjustments are not that difficult to figure out.
- The game is open information and therefore entirely calculable. If you have optimizers in your game group, watch out! They could potentially slow the game down a lot.

If this is your primary game genre, then you may find this worth holding onto. Otherwise, look for something more interesting.

While I haven't played with the expansion, I did examine it. I think this is one game that the expansion would greatly improve. While I think the Investor Card expansion adds a whole heap of unwanted randomness, everything else in the expansion looks like an improvement on the original. Not sure, though, that it will make enough of a difference for me.

Pretty good route-building game. As far as theme and art go in route-building games, I prefer those of Ticket to Ride and Thurn and Taxis. This one does add some nice twists, such as income management and "renting" other people's routes - turns it into a combination route-building/economic game, which at least for me is a new and intriguing combo. After 2 plays, there is enough depth of strategies to keep the game interesting, so I'd happily play this again. I'm a little dissatisfied with the predictability of the end-game though, once the first final flight card has been played.  There also seems to be an unbeatable strategy of doing short-routes, setting up final flight, then triggering 2nd vacation; so once everyone starts doing that, I'm not sure how much strategic depth will be left - I'll see as I get more plays in.  I like that the money is really really tight, more so than in any other game I've played - it forces each player to make tough decisions.

After three plays, two things start worrying me.
1. With the current rules for game end the starting players are favoured. 
2. The long distance routes see far less use. The game end is usually triggered by the second vacation card in the short distance routes. The balance between these two stacks seems off.

I saw this game in Essen 2008 and passed it due to the terrible cover design and an unknown publisher leading me to believe this is roll-and-move. Since then, the good comments on BGG convinced me to give it a try. It took me until Essen 2009 to secure a copy as nobody in Germany is selling it. It was worth the wait. It's a slightly more involved gamers' version of Ticket to Ride or Thurn & Taxis, both games I enjoy very much. It might rise to their level with more play. For now, it' an 8/10.

COMMENT: 
Jet Set is a route building game with an airline theme. The gameplay typically involves very little player interaction with 2 or 3 players; it is impossible to stop opponents from building the routes that they would like to, you can only slow them down. Surprisingly, however, the game is still engaging and a lot of fun to play but seems to work much better with 4+ players. The game pieces and artwork are very attractive.

Comments after initial play:

Jet Set is another "train game" that falls in somewhere between Ticket to Ride and Age of Steam in complexity. Other games in this category include Canal Mania, and On the Underground. I think it struck me about the same as these other games--pretty good, but not as good as TTR or AoS. I would like to try it again, perhaps with less people. There are too many cards to process in a beginning 5 player game which induces a bit of AP when everyone is trying to figure out where all the cities are.

A play of this economic game was long due.
People have compared this to TTR. If I have to make a comparison with TTR. Jet Set is a step closer to Age of Steam (or Steam).

Playing the game I notice that the designer made some excellent choices. Cash management is important by investing in certain routes just to get money in  (short term). The other thing that is important is working towards one of your final flight cards from the start (long term)
If one route could be used for both , great.  
The mix of these strategies is well executed.


The only  caveat  I have is that players can become kingmakers if the game is decided by a tie. 
If this kingmaking occurs because of position optimalisation, obtaining the best possible place, I have no problem with that.
I tell this because in or maiden 4 player game it came down to a tiebreaker which I won 16 to 15. No Kingmaking did occur.

I want to mention one more thing. About the "start player won again" comment by a user.
It's true that start players have an advantage.  They get possible first, fifth, and ninth choice of a route while the player in fourth position has to go with fourth, eight and twelfth choice.

You could use this "shortcoming" to your advantage when playing this with new players or as a family.

I can think of two ways to cope with that. 

1) First player of a round moves counter clockwise.
A,B,C,D than D,A,B, C, Than C,D,A,B and than B,C,D,A to get to A,B,C,D again.
This means that one player gets two turns right after each other.
This would cause more routes being stealed and would add an extra layer.

2) The second solution has to be a money one. 
A : 30
B: 32
C: 37
D: 39
E41
F43

I haven't done the math but this looks to be right for a couple of reasons.

 As for now it aides all players but the start player to go for a more expensive route.
And for the players in third and fourth, fith and sixth spot to place an extra plane.
Or for the fifth and sixth player to claim an extra route.

You can also limit the cash of the first two players but this would make life really difficult for them since they can't perform a good income round at the start of the game and that would put them really behind in the latter rounds.
 
This would also be better because money is a tiebrekaer and there is an uneven amount of turns.

Of these suggestions I prefer the second one because you could possibly steal a route from a player.

Bought from Essen 2008. Strong seven for Jet Set after the first game. There isn't that much new ideas actually, but because the money is so tight, it makes the mix even more challenging and more interesting. I'm already waiting for the next session...

After five plays, I think I've seen much of what interests me in this game.  I'd rather just play TTR even though the games are different.  Money is rather tight as you work to develop networks to collect completed tickets/routes.  While you can probably win without finishing your final flight, I think this will prove difficult to do on most occasions.

Interesting connection game where players draft short or long flight cards and pay to create connections on the board to fulfill those flights.  Once a route has been setup the player owning the connection generates income from it for a set number of turns.  Players can also pay to use other player's hubs to fulfill a flight.  There's also an end-game long-flight which is worth a good deal of points but takes a lot of resources to setup.  You want your long-flight to ideally be comprised of shorter routes that you had set up earlier.  Played with 4 and think it might start getting too chaotic with 5 or 6.

Enjoyable route building game with tight money and time management.  Plus they did a nice job on the pieces.  The board may look muted but it aids in seeing the colorful planes and markers while they're on the board (and there will be a lot of them).  Has a much better depth vs. playtime than ticket to ride which some people compare it to but it is much less forgiving and in the end, a far superior gamers experience.

This game is sort of like a slightly more complex version of Ticket to Ride except that you essentially buy route segments with money instead of using sets of drafted cards. The only real problem with it is that the first person to play a "Final Route" card will likely be sitting there twidding their thumbs for 5 rounds instead of actively competing until the end even though that person will likely win.

RATING: 6.3
Light euro game about creating flight routes, using them to get income in order to create larger routes.

The idea is not fully original, but it features an interesting development. So, overall, the idea is very appealing to me, but I'm not that happy with how it works. 
-> The gameplay is quite lucky: if the links you need match with the available routes, that's great. If they don't match, you're in trouble, because you will have to get routes you don't need in order to get income.
-> Starting is a big advantage and the other players don't get any other benefit to compensate for that. Not everybody plays the same number of rounds. Also, the first player gets to choose between all the 1 link routes, while the last player will probably need to spend €1 to get something decent (and the first player will have full choice again, thanks to the money spent by the last player).
-> Getting your final objective done gets you 2 points each turn. There's no other way to get that many points per turn, not even close. That means you should be ready to do it asap. So, again, if the available routes do not match with the ones you need for your target...
-> Paying another player in order to place a plane in his link is so expensive that you will only do it for the final objective (or a 7 points one).

The game will still be quite lucky, but the starting player issue can be house ruled very easily.

The graphic design is quite poor, including the board, the box and the cards. Only the planes are cool.

One good thing is that it doesn't last that long. Our first game lasted about 80 minutes (for 4 players). 

I don't think this is a game I would want to keep on the long term, but I'm willing to play a few more times.

RATING: 2.7
[2010/01/04]

played 1 practice/ 1 real... the practice lasted 2 turns because someone didn't get a short route early own and basically was out of the game for the next "many" moves... how lame is that?... if you don't pick up a short route you can be totally screwed... and the cards are random.. so you could easily be screwed right off the bat... I'm not liking that so far....


so durring the "real" game we all got short routes right away to start pulling in income.... as for the game play... a lot depends on these secret "victory scenario" cards you get at the begining of the game...  and if by chance route cards pop up that help you complete your "victory scenario" (kind of what happend to me)  then you just get a HUGE advantage...

With that advantage I still only won by 1 point, but the play was boring at best... let me elaborate: I basically did the best move possible for the cards i had in my hand plus the cards on the table... no one could interfere with my strategy (nor would they want to, or know how to)... 
So basically assuming that you have 4 decent players that play the best move for their hands there would be a guarenteed winner based on the way the cards were delt...

someone good with worse cards could beat someone that sucks with better cards... but that doesn't seem fun to me


Not recommended.

The next step for fans of Ticket to Ride. The challenges of recognizing good routes are still in this game, but with added difficulty. The airplane routes are curvy and it is easy to miss a good connection. In this game you complete tickets, just as you do in TtR and there are long and short routes. You do have to purchase your routes though and that means managing your money well. Completing tickets keeps the money coming in. Really enjoyable game!

Claim a series of short routes with low VPs to build your income engine, and aim to gradually connect these short routes into longer routes to claim bigger VP’s. There’s occasional AP whilst people choose from available routes that don’t meet their long term strategy, but in the main turns are fast because you only get one action. You tend to get into an income / invest / claim-route cycle which feels like you’re inching forwards, and this feels somewhat at odds with what may be too much luck in the revealed route cards. It's enjoyable if you can take it for what it is, some meat at the lighter end of the spectrum, but there's a caveat in that the tight map and limited routes on offer can engender mucho gamer frustration with opponents claiming your proposed routes just before you. I'm on the fence still on whether this frustration is good and natural, or just a fun/satisfaction impairment.

This game looks a little like Ticket to Ride, but the heavy economic element makes it much more of a brain burner.  The random element introduced by the route cards may be too much for this type of game.  I wasn't a big fan of the graphic layout: it was hard to tell visually where the routes were going and who owned them, and the airplane pieces often got in the way.  Still fun, though.

I love most games with a geographical connection mechanic but my first play with 3 means Jet Set won't be joining the highfliers in my collection (e.g. Expedition, TransAmerica). 

This is mainly due to what is essentially a spatial game gets bogged down by the calculating of your placements, much like in Powergrid. (In passing, to compare the two and why I prefer the latter is that the fixed values makes calculations feel less like work (instead of variables) and the board looks less cluttered and easier to see where players are heading). 

And to cap off the left brain exercise, player status is fractured by the values of the flight cards. I did like the problem of financing that the monetary layer brought to this genre but it felt distracting.

With 3 players there didn't seem to be tense competition for routes.

RATING: 8
I really enjoy network/connection games in general.  Jet Set offers an interesting challenge in that you need to collect short routes to generate income, but ideally, you want those short routes to contribute to your Final Flight as well.  Sometimes the cards offer the exact synergy you're looking for, but most of the time, they don't, and tough decisions result.

The first game, I found the map overwhelming and felt it was very mentally exhausting to keep locating all the possible routes for all the available tickets.  But with each subsequent playing, it became much easier to process the board, and the fun factor went way up.

RATING: 7
It's like Ticket to Ride in that it has route taking and is fairly quick, but that's about it. Route taking is a bit more variable, since one can use one's own routes or other's routes multiple times if you need to. The ending is anti-climactic, and I'm not sure of the overall value of claiming your final route first.

A route-building game with a money-management mechanic. I found the board to be garish (because of the colors) and difficult to read (because the routes on it are tangled). I usually enjoy this sort of game, but I felt somehow that this game lacked something. I'd rather play a Ticket to Ride game (simpler and lasting about as long) or a more complex game (Railways of the World, or any of a number of train games) when I want to play a route-builder.

We played this game with the Distant Lands and Jumbo Jets expansions (and all the micro expansions that come in those).  This is a fun game.  There is a decent amount going on here and it I wouldn't introduce it to new gamers.

My criticisms are the distant land expansion (JUST the distant land module) and the game play length.  The distant land module didn't really add much to the game for us.  It's ok, but I'd probably leave it out.  The other modules in the Distant Land expansion box were great.

The game play length is a bit much with all the modules. I love the replay value all the different modules provide.  I wouldn't recommend playing with all of them at once (way too long to setup and play), but 2 or 3 each time you play.   Hell, yeah!

I like the fact that there is pressure to finish you unique but that you have another way out to score points other than your secret route.  There is a lot of planning that is need early on so it could create AP especially with more player since there are more cards at the beginning that need to analyzed.

I finally had an opportunity to play my copy of Jet Set, albeit with only one opponent. I enjoyed the game very much and see potential for an even better experience with more players. With two, there was very little competition for routes (I don't think either of us every placed a plane on a route we didn't own) and hence not much interaction.

Still, I found myself thinking a lot more than when I play TTR. Particularly challenging, and perhaps the heart of the game, is trying to piece together short routes to claim longer ones and a Final Flight. This is made difficult by the maze-like way the cities are connected. It's a field day for people who like optimization puzzles.

We did make a couple of newbie mistakes: We forgot that routes cost different amounts (even though the costs are printed on the board!), my opponent claimed his Final Flight with the cities linked in the wrong order and neither of us realized it until the end.

Even though I played this once I can't say I learned anything about the game. I misread one of my routes right off the bat and wound up not having enough money to complete any routes. This left me with literally nothing to do but pass and occasionally spend a buck to refill the route board, hoping to find the one route card that I could fill. Twenty turns of this and the card finally showed up, allowing me to fulfill my one and only route out of nothing if not weak pride. A very punishing newbie mistake. SECOND GAME: Well, I didn't come in last.

None-too-deep route connecting game with a nice tight-money-supply system to stop things being too easy.  Perhaps the luck of the draw may be a factor in some games, but the flexibility of the board layout is good, mitigating the frustration factor somewhat.

After 1 game it seems interesting enough to play again. Unfortunately I completely invalidated the game by accidentally breaking a rule about when you can play your final destination thingy.

After 2 6p games I thought there was a dominant strategy which was fairly boring - go directly for your Final Flight and rush the end of the game so you can play it.

After some thought I figured maybe that was a side effect of the 6 player rules - they make it way too easy to rush the game end. With fewer players the game end would come slower and the game would probably play out as it was intended.

After finally playing a 4p game, it seems my guess was correct. The game was much more interesting and fun, and rushing the game end took long enough that players could actually finish several routes!

In conclusion, Jet Set is not a 6 player game. 5 players may or may not work. 4 players seemed pretty good. If you do play with 6 players, I'd say play with 4p rules (min 4 cards, max 8), but just put 12 1-vp cards out to start. I might try just dealing 2 1-vp cards to each player instead to jump start the first 3 turns.

I found this to be an interesting take on connections games (i.e. I think of it as a train game even though it has a airplane theme).  It combines aspects of claiming and controlling various connections with collection of routes worth victory points by using these connections.  The catch is that you have to give up some of your planes on those connections (i.e. dedicate them to that route) in order to claim the route, and consequently the points and income.  Cash is very tight, so you need to make everything count as much as possible.  The decreasing income values of your claimed routes help keep a runaway leader in check.  And it looks really nice.

Very nice connection game.  Lots of decisions.  This game rumbles along on a tight and rewarding economy. 

Lucky flips can be a little overly fortunate, but not enough to break the game, but these do reward speculation as one of your goals.

I really don't get the T2R comparisons here: there is no rummy element, you don't have a hand of cards, it is an economic game where you idealize your investments translating them into more income or vps, routes are active and recede, and you can pay to use other people's routes.  That said it does have a map with cities with preprinted routes on them, plastic pieces that you can lay on routes, and cards that you draft, that's about it.

A nice economic network-building game. Sort of like TTR in that you claim routes for points, but the routes are more interconnected, only a random selection are available (in a Tycoon-like display), and there is an economic game built in there as well (routes provide income which you need to claim other routes). After 1 play, I definitely want to play it again: fun!

Problems:
- tiddly-wink route claim markers are difficult to see easily
- there are a lot of routes available, and you have to figure out where the cities are and what you should go for; we started marking the routes we'd connected by placing an airplane on the card (on display)
- note sure that one can win without finishing the final flight? Of course, not sure that that's necessarily a problem.

Ticket to Fly Europe. Race to connect the cities to complete the routes, claim some connections for income and make the most of every turn. Probably a minor hit with route building fans, but it doesn't grab me.

Much better route building game than Ticket To Ride.  In this game, blocking someone almost always benefits you while in TTR just let them by or they'll rack up a ton o' points going around you.  Great bits makes connecting your routes tons of fun and an open destination claiming mechanism keeps this one intense until the end.

RATING: 7
rating possibly changeable.  Seems like a good game, but with a little potential AP.  perhaps that will clear up after everyone is more familiar with the destinations or perhaps it will get a little worse.  That's what remains to be seen--if it gets quicker, expect the rating to rise by a full point.  If it gets any slower, expect it to fall by a half.

Love the tight money and the great payout mechanism and the one action turns.  Don't like the routes which sometimes cross over/under one another, nor the complexity in tracing some routes.  Rules are easy to learn and easy to explain, but the game lacked some dynamic play because, I believe, the map and its connections weren't known to us.

Outstanding game of routes and rates which I first played November 2008.  The game shines with 5 or 6 but is quite playable all the way down to 2.  A fine economic scramble with a sharp, interesting deadline.

[2012-02-29] Es hat meine Erwartungen erfüllt und viel Spaß gemacht.
Es hat einen angenehmen Rhythmus - ausbreiten, Streckenkarte einsammeln, Geld kassieren, ausbreiten... -, ein pfiffiges Endspiel, einen angenehmen Glücksfaktor (aufgedeckte Streckenkarten), hohen Wiederspielreiz (zusammen mit der DL-Erweiterung), mir gefallen die kleinen Flieger, und genügend Interaktion; auch bei vier Spielern ist man relativ schnell wieder dran (da jeder Spieler immer nur eine, kurze, Aktion hat). Ein zwei Mechanismen sind pfiffig (z.B. werfen Strecken 3x 5€ ab, und ab dann nur noch 2€ pro Kassier-Aktion - gibt einen angenehmen Zwang zur Reinvestition), das Thema zwar aufgesetzt, aber interessant...

Ich bin sehr zufrieden.

Einziger "Nachteil": Wie viele Spiele mit festen Spielplänen skaliert es nicht sehr gut. Also, bei zwei Spielern hat man viel Platz in Europa, bei sechs Spielern wird's sehr schnell sehr eng. Würde ich gerne mal ausprobieren.

Gerne nochmal, dann noch mit zwei, drei Erweiterungsregeln (z.B. die Distand Lands und Hubs; evtl. Investor-Karten, die sollen lt. Tom Vassal das Spiel beschleunigen, IIRC).

I think I was vaguely aware that this game would be released at Essen 08, but nothing I'd seen made me consider it further. Someone suggested we play it, and it proved a hit. Create routes between cities to claim flight cards, which give VP and income. Everything costs money, and money seems very tight so you need to keep a careful eye on bringing new routes on stream (for maximum income) rather than holding back for some killer blow late in the game. Having said that, the end-game secret mission holiday flight card can earn a hefty VP bonus if timed well.

[gameid=38872] puts you in the role of an airline tycoon. You buy links across Europe, hoping to secure the best routes and score the most points. Before start of play, each player is given a choice of 2 final flights cards, which are worth 10 points with the potential to score another 10 points.

There are short routes, which may be a quick link between Oslo and Copenhagen (1 point), slightly longer routes, which involves an additional stop (3 points) - or the longest routes of 3-4 links but also giving you the most points (5 or 7). Furthermore, the longer routes will give you business cards (if playing with the expansion). These can be very valuable and inject some variety in the game (or just additional funds).

It plays in around 75 minutes for us. Requires  a great deal of thought and foreplaning, but is well worth the effort. It is a great game and one we treasure.

Different number of players definitely causes the game to play differently. More players means longer run time, but the down time still isn't very bad. Players somewhat like TtR, but there is more angst and definitely more complexity involved with Jet Set. Very nice components and well worth adding to one's collection as a step up from TtR.

RATING: 5
The sterile Reaganomics color scheme doesn't do Jet Set any favors, and the game beneath similarly lacks a rich palette of gameplay.  The gulf between single link routes and the insanely complicated missions is not bridged by an arc.  With no gameplay development or rising momentum, Jet Set reaches its crusing altitude quickly and then just sits there.

I prefer this to Ticket To Ride, which is similar but Jet Set has more depth due to the economic aspect, as well as the player interaction and table talk (which can be absent from TTR) due to the necessity of using one another's routes, and paying for the privilege.

Connection game with a tight economy and tough decisions on when to commit to a route.  I have very much enjoyed my first 6 plays and am still learning a lot as I play.  I like the European map and the simple artwork allows you to focus on the network.

Really is better than most train games I've played and don't be fooled by little plastic planes this is a train game. Still not stocks and no pick up/deliver stuff so it's more streamlined and doesn't take 4-6 hours. I'd like to play it again and see if I can get my head around it better that's for sure.

Spend money to place your airplanes on key airlinks between cities. The first to place an airplane on a link gains cheaper rights, but other players can still use the link for a price. A number of flight cards are on display; a player can claim one after connecting the two cities shown. Longer flights are worth more points, but the short flights are easier and less expensive to achieve, and they bring in just as much income as the long flights. At the end, it's urgent to get your secret Final Flight done, connecting three cities. The winner is the player with the most valuable collection of flights achieved, including bonuses for finishing the Final Flight sooner.

After several games, I am thinking that the luck involved in who gets initial routes that match up well with one of their final routes, the early 3-routes that come out, or both, is too great. But I might change my mind.

This was the first game I played with a new gaming group. I was not excited to play it as the theme didn't speak to me. However, the game play was grand, and I really enjoyed myself. It was more than Ticket to Ride with an economy. I scooped up a copy soon after.

Update 10/2014
Not as great with only two. Felt a bit scripted. Might be better with more income choices / variety in setup, which is provided by the expansion.

ECONOMIC game.  You don't just build a network, you have to pay operating costs each time you utilize one of your links. Three-way choice each turn: 1) Build or 2) collect Points or   3) collect Income.  Pick ONE.

The planes don't just get placed and left sitting.  They commonly go onto and off the board and back again.

You start with enough money to buy two or three short routes. You must use income from them to support buying more/longer ones. Sometimes you have to rent routes from others. Winner is based on POINTS that each route is worth (not money). Longer routes are worth more points.

A more complicated, more strategic Ticket to Ride, with a neat system allowing you to fly your planes on other player's routes, allowing you to collect a destination card before them, but giving them some profit in the process. Money was really tight, need to play this more.

RATING: 5
The comparisons to Ticket to Ride are understandable, but misleading.  In fact, I find more in common between this game and On the Underground than I do between it and Ticket to Ride.  There's a lot going on between turns, especially as you get more players involved in the game, to the point where I'm not sure I would want to play this much with more than 3 players.  Of course, I'm saying that having only played the game with 5 thus far.  It's a neat game, mechanically, and I really like the endgame mechanism (the player who triggers it has the potential to get a lot of points), but I'd like to see how it plays with fewer players before deciding its fate.

A bit of a surprise.  Didn't know what to expect on this one.  Starts off a bit slow and constrained, and builds up into a crescendo of tension and competition for tickets/cards.  My group (2 gamers, 3 wives) really liked it.

5 may be 1 too many, but my opinion may change.  5 started out a bit slow, but sped up once everyone understood what was going on.  Even though it is an easy game, there was a bit of a learning curve.

After 4 plays. You build to control links, then claim routes, then take income from the route. Sounds easy but it is a big puzzle. The good thing is that rarely do two players compete for the same route. You need to plan for the final ticket or a couple of smaller ones at the end. It is a very good game that I enjoy more each time I play.

RATING: 6.5
A very tight (in terms of money) connections game in which if you cannot claim a good set of tickets early on, it's quite possible to screw yourself out of the competition.  There is no catch-up mechanism and no loan built-in, thus making the gameplay very inflexible.  I don't quite like how all cards have equal value in income yet the higher point ones will cost more than triple of the cost to obtain.  Seems like a good next step choice for fans of Ticket to Ride.  Fairly easy to understand rules with decent production.  I could be convinced to play again.

RATING: 6.5
When you first see this game, you might think “O, it’s Ticket to Ride with planes.” To be short and clear. It’s not. Of course the basic idea, completing routes between cities, is the same, but that’s all that is there about. In TTR, the route cards are hidden. in Jet Set, they are open on the table. In TTR the trains stay on the map, when they are used to fulfill a route. The airplanes in Jet Set are removed after they have flown a route. In Jet Set, you need money, that is scare, to buy planes. In TTR you need wagons, which there are enough of, to build a route.

This game is a little bit more tactical than TTR is. Therefore it’s less suitable to use it as a family game. But on the other hand, for hard-core boardgamers, it might not be tactical enough. Result: This is a game that is suitable for a very small group. A group which exists of people who love to play a family game, and love to play a harder game. People like us. Both of us think this is a very nice game. We’ll play it more, but it’s not that great game everybody is always looking for.

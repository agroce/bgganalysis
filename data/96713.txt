worker placement with agro shoot-outs for building rewards. gather the most money before the railroad gets to town. really liked it but its a fairly fast game. Lots of cardboard (workers, building, money). Bought at Gen Con. one of my favs from the show. extra points for western theme.

Played my first game of this Dec 2013.  Someone at work had it and wanted to play it... and I'll never turn down a game!  Especially one I never played before.

The rules seem to be well written.  One tiny complaint: it would be better to have the building tiles be listed in alphabetical order, as opposed to number, because honestly, once you pick the tile and place it, you can't see the number anyway...  Still, this rules booklet was much easier to read that any of the others from Fantasy Flight that I've gone through (and I've read through Netrunner, Arkham Horror, Mansions of Madness and Mansions of Madness: Call of the Wild - for some perspective.)

The game itself was easy to understand, and a lot of fun.  The shoot-out rules were confusing when reading at first, but when we acted it out it made sense (if you have more dice than the other person, you shoot first, just like in Westerns).  

I won my first game by manipulating it to end while I had a man at the stage coach.  The train station would have been placed in the next turn, and I really didn't want that to happen.  So I sent a man into town to start a shootout - he got the last wanted poster from the pool, ending the game and making me the wealthiest.

Overall, a nice themed western game with tile placement.  I'd definitely play it again (and I have!)  I have a feeling that the random drawing of tiles would make replays stay fresh and not be boring...  

...And they aren't boring!  I've played several games now, and each has been very different based on which tiles are present.

Great game, especially as a gateway euro. The theme doesn't feel at all pasted on (the bullets, ponies, wanted posters, all "feel like" their game mechanics, etc) and it has some direct player conflict which a lot of people require to start playing a game.

The ending can stumble up on you if you're not careful, so I'm sure to remind players of that... still, quite a few games have ended anti-climatically.

RATING: 8
Early take, I like this game a lot. Really comes down to being a simple worker placement game with an awesome shootout mechanic. Would love to play it a good bit more to get down the nuances of the different buildings. Also, as a guess, I would say this game is probably better the more people you have.

Too quick and an abrupt end to the game with little shootout action with 2 players, but I would like to try this with 3 or 4.

RATING: 4
With most worker placement games you are trying to collect resources in order to accomplish one goal or another that in the end will score you points in order to win the game. Deadwood removes the goal aspect of a worker placement game. In this game you are simply placing workers in order to get money which is points at the end of the game. In short it removes a major aspect of what a worker placement game is. And it doing so it makes the game dull and monotonous.

Nice components, easy to play. I like the concept, shootout method and the various buildings. Variable game-ending conditions, depending on the mood of the players, could end the game quickly, however. Unfortunately, after one 4-player game, the others hated it and I found the game much too simple, and lackluster.

RATING: 7
A pretty light worker placement style game.  The object is to collect money, but it seems like there's not really enough opportunities to do that.  The bank gives you $5, most places give you $1, some places give you nothing.  I was a bit surprised to see the 90 minute play time listed here because our game went a lot quicker than that.  I need to try it again.

There is good little game that is likely to leave you with a nagging question.  It plays fast, but not so quick that it can be just a filler.  It's easy to teach, but you still have to take some time to explain what all the locations do.  Play strategy is easy to approach, but demands enough attention and insight that first time players are likely to miss it and lose to more experienced players.  Replay value and variety is remarkably high in the game, but its not entirely clear that folks are inclined to invest that much time into the plays.  And that kind of sums up the overall game play experience and leads to the nagging question  How do you finish the following description: it's good, but...

Couple plays in with 3 people...other than playing it completely wrong the first time around, I enjoy this game.  Two actions (initially) to choose from per turn makes this one an easy game to teach with multiple paths to victory.  While it is not the deepest game, it has enough strategy/dice rolling/theme to make it work well together, particularly when teaching non-gamers or when time is short.  Play time of 60 minutes ha been pretty spot on, if not faster with three.

I was looking for a lighter, cheaper game to add to my collection. This was recommended by a local game shop employee. Though I was turned off by the worker placement style of gameplay idea, I was promised I would enjoy the 'shootout' feature of the game. I'm glad I made this purchase. Very enjoyable and fairly short, if all players are conscious about the time the spend on their turn.

Likes:
- The artwork throughout the game is spectacular
- I actually like the combat system, and have no problem with people losing a 3 to a 1
- Like the action mechanics that go with this game.  Move a dude to the city or move back 1 to many dudes.

Dislikes:
- More often than not, if someone loses a battle they should have won, they just end up getting upset and throwing the game (trying to kill off the rest of their guys)
- Sometimes it feels like there are not enough things to do with a cowboy, especially early.
- The scoring mechanic with the railroad just simply does not work in my opinion

Notes:
- Can be fun, however it seems like many times the game just goes sour for someone, and then their mission is to end the game as fast as possible.

This a pretty good worker placement game.  Unlike most games it features direct conflict with the ability to shoot people.  Did someone take the spot you wanted?  Well, load up your six shooter and try to shoot em dead!  The game plays quickly and the length is actually controlled by the players.  Lots of neat stuff going on in this small box.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
it is in constant motion and you need to watch the other players, and the counter what they are doing. good idea to have several sheets with the action definisions of the building tiles so players can be looking at the definitions at the same time. this will speed the game up when you have new players.

I've often heard people compare this to Carson City, sometimes even suggesting that Deadwood is the superior version. 

Those people are wrong. Yes, this game is lighter and simpler than CC, and you get to kill each other's workers in this one (whoopee!). But whereas Carson City can be a really tense, exciting experience, there is absolutely no tension here at all.

Part of the problem is that once you use a building, your worker just sits there doing nothing, blocking even you from using a space again. This means that when you are challenged in a shootout, you don't really care because that worker isn't doing anything for you anyway. Secondly, the buildings don't combo with each other in very interesting ways. Players seem to spend most of their time fighting over the bank, or simply gaining a dollar or getting rid of a warrant, in order to use the bank again. If the Sheriff is blocking the bank, then people simply fight over the Sheriff. The only time the game seems to get interesting is when someone builds a railroad, speeding the end game along.  I would like to try this with a full complement of players, but for now, I don't see where the appeal is.

Played with 2 so far and it didn't really shine as it seems to end very quickly but we thought the game would with any number of players as the you need to go to the town hall to get new buildings and at the same time it puts rail track down so you can only do it 5 times and the game ends so you only ever get  4 new buildings. We had only one shoot-out. Will have to see how it fairs with more players. 1 Play.

Played once, but couldn't really care much about it, it does have some interesting mechanics but the imo the dice rolling nature of the duel is a bit too random and actually reduces the rates of duel (compared to other possible mechanics).  the placement mechanics are interesting but that alone is not enough to make me come back to the game (despite the fact that I won but I have no idea how).  The mechanics do make me want to try the Manhattan project though as they seems to share the similar placement mechanics.

I live near Deadwood, SD so I had to get this game after hearing about it. I had medium expectations about the quality after reading some reviews, but was pleasantly surprised by the mechanics. The components aren't the best quality (everything is a cardboard punch-out besides the dice), and the box doesn't have separate compartments, so storage is a pain, but the game itself is very fun. The different level cowboys lead to some interesting decisions. The game can end very quickly, although players have the ability to delay it by guarding the town hall. Overall I've had a very good time with this game.

Very quick worker placement game. If you compare this to Agricola or other worker placements games you will be disappointed with this game. 
Deadwood is a well themed game with lots of shootouts as cowboys fight over locations. I like the theme and the light game play.
The  game always felt clunky for me. If I want to play a fun western game this is not it. If I want to play a worker placement game this is not it.

RATING: 7
This is my favorite worker placement game, not because it is the best design, but because it is the most fun. Gaming for me is never about winning or losing but the journey getting there. So taking a genre that is typically dry, shortening it and then adding shootouts tailors the game to my tastes. Sure it adds randomness, sure it means the best "player" doesn't always wins. It allows players to always feel involved and part of the game. In typical DUST Games fashion though, the game feels just shy of greatness. It just feels like with a little more creativity it could have been something really special, as it is it is just plain special.

Interesting mechanic for the shoot out.  The railroad coming into town and making adjacent properties more valuable adds some depth to the game. End of game ties are decided cleverly--they have a final shot out with no restrictions on the number of bullets, unlike the rest of the game.  

The theme is enjoyable as well as the graphics that accompany it.  Rules are easy, setup fast, and play progresses quickly. The dice do not overwhelm the game.  It is a light game everybody liked.

A great light filler game with a super cool theme if you are into that sort of thing. The components are top notch except the box insert sucks ass. I hate when I have to store things underneath the cardboard insert, I guess I could just take that out, but I dont like to do that.  Anyhoo, minor quibble....I think the sweet spot for this game for sure would be 3-4 players, I played with 2 players and it was fine, but you could easily do what you needed to do and avoid shootouts. Only, the shootouts are the best part...so yeah, I would just stick to a higher player count.

It gets some low marks from some users, but Deadwood is actually a pretty easy Wild West area control game to dive into. The combat is a nice twist (for a game of this type), although the rest of the gameplay features have been done many times before.

So, the best parts are that it plays pretty quickly, allows some in-your-face combat while still providing some area control strategy. There are quite a few tiles' functions to remember- that can be a bit annoying.

The setting is great and so are the components. But the game itself... 

No short-term planning because of the dice.

No long-term planning because of the variable game-end which can be triggered almost instantly.

And it could have been so great...

An easy-to-learn area-of-control game where players fight over money-making buildings and try to end or extend the game depending on how far ahead or behind they are. Aggressive play via shootouts isn't as beneficial as defending key territories, at least not in two-player games. This makes what could be a great Wild West game an exercise in caution and control.

RATING: N/A
Worker placement with a twist - ousting other players' pawns with a dice duel.
Might get a bit lopsided if one player wins a lot of duels, but it plays fast enough so that's okay.
Has a 'loose' sort of feeling to it, sort of makeshifty, but not annoyingly so.

A good game about the crazy shoot-em-up wild wild west with a great mix of die rolling and worker placement. The kids love this game! They love it when I act out the story behind each shootout that occurs throughout the game. As far as cons: It may get repetative after a while, the art work does get muddy with all the tiles out on the board, and the rules are a little unclear sometimes. All in all, a very good worker placement game that I would recommend to anyone who's looking for something western themed.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (October  2013)

Ok light game, I generally dislike games in which many players have to attack the leader to balance the game. Deadwood is this kind of game but it can be fun with the right crowd. The rules are pretty straightforward and the components are very nice as is usual from FFG. The theme does nothing for me.

It features worker placement a la Manhattan Project, you either play one worker, or retire any amount of workers (I‚Äôm aware that you have to retire all workers in MP :D) . That mechanics makes the game as it allow for some interesting decisions, however the game  also has a healthy dose of luck (Duels, Gold Mine, tiles), if someone is winning you have to try to take him out of some profitable buildings and it is mostly luck if you manage to do so. 

The playtime is, relatively, short. Otherwise I would rate it a lot lower. 

In conclusion, there is not anything wrong with the game, however it fails to really excite me. Deadwood is not a game to play often, but I would not say no to a game from time to time.  I don‚Äôt plan to buy it. 

Current Rating: 5.5

Nice worker placement game brightened up and given variety by fast small-step turns, the unpredictable board growth expansion and (in particular) the gunfight and wanted poster mechanisms. These make it much more interactive than many run of the mill snooze-inducing WP games in which the interaction is limited to opportunity-cost grabbing of resources/tiles to deny them to others.

I like the core concept of this game a lot, and it's fun, but it can have pacing issues. The initial allotment of buildings contributes to the modularity of the game, but some setups are better than others. Without the Stage Depot, there is no way to add new tiles other than the town hall, which is undesirable to annex without the hotel. Additionally, a well placed sheriff and a player who camps there can slow the game down unless the Grifter comes out. The most interesting part of this game is carefully placing your workers and waiting for a moment when your opponent is forced to leave, opening spots for your advancement

Meh.  Interesting twist on worker placement - being able to shoot someone off the space you want (if you roll well).  Alright game overall but not something I imagine will hit the table often for us.  Would be more fun with a group of people who love confrontation.

After my 3rd play I've noticed something.  It seems to me that the mechanics of the game are well suited to having gunfights, but gunfights are not well suited to the victory conditions.  This leaves me wishing that the gunfights in this game helped you win instead of keeping you from winning.

I've always been a fan of Western games, ever since TSR's Boot Hill.  Our group usually plays epic 8+ person BANG! games, so it's refreshing to have a new Western game to play.  The game is a lot of fun, very well themed, and very interactive with other players.  One of my grips with a lot of games is playing against the board - not with Deadwood.  You are directly attacking and kicking players/cowboys off annexed buildings in the game.  The game is an absolute hoot and very very fun!  The only gripes I have are that is plays best with 3+ people.  Two players is just OK, not too competitive.  The game board tile placement mechanic doesn't seem to matter that much, as it's not very intuitive.  From what I can tell, tile placement doesn't seem to be a dominant factor for Deadwood, it's more about cowboys, theft, and killing!  Besides that, it's a great cowboy action game!  I would definitely rate Deadwood higher than Bang!

RATING: 6
People are too hard on this game, probably because it could have been a "real" game but the dice driven gun fighting makes it very luck based.  It's a fun, medium-light game that plays reasonably fast with a huge chance component.  The theme is strong and the action is very 'narrative'.  The game is beautiful with very nice production values.  If you like the Far West, games that tell stories, some light euro-type planning and can live with dice rolling and randomness, you should like this.

Acquired at Target for 9 bucks.  I couldn't turn down a deal like that.  The components are made up of a nice sturdy board and lots of thick cardboard.  That's it.  The game is simple worker placement and tile laying with a dash of conflict resolved by way of dice rolls.  Not a bad little game especially for what I paid.  I don't have any western themed WP games in my library so this filled a niche.  After one play, it's not a bad game but there are plenty of other games that are just better.

I normally don't like very much worker placement games, but this one is very well crafted. I like the combat (shootout) system - simple and elegant. I also like that, because of the existence of 3 quite different victory conditions, you have to pay attention in every turn to not let your opponents end the game in a moment that is not advantageous for you. 

I also have to add that the more the players the better the game. This is definitely not a 2-player game.

Type: VP race = a game where you race to collect victory points (fastest/most).

Playing time: See BGG.
Player interaction: Conflict and competition for scarce resources - actions.

Replayability: Average, it's quick so why not go again?.
Fun: The game does a good job turning dry worker placement into a thematic wild west experience, so it's actually pretty fun. Gunfights are exciting.
Memorability: Not so much, worker placement still doesn't create stories.

Thematic integration: Good.
Components: Great! Very good at communicating the theme. The tiny cardboard dollar bills are my favourite.

Who will like this: People that want a wild west theme with their worker placement.

This game is a blast. Very quick and dirty worker placement game with a strong theme. Maybe could use an expansion at this point, but for an almost filler-length worker placement that supports up to 5 players, I have yet to come across anything I enjoy more. Plays best with a full group.

UPDATE: Played this again after a long absence. I'm not sure if I'm just starting to lose interest in worker placement games in general or what, but this was pretty meh. I wish the iconography on the buildings was a little clearer, and I wish that there was more direction given to the players.

The standout feature of this worker placement game, the ability to kill off opponent's workers to claim their locations, is so poorly described in the instructions that we aborted our first attempt at playing the game out of confusion. Compounding the problem is the fact that combat is carried out using a D6 roll-for-damage mechanic. Blech! I detest dice combat.

On the bright side, if one is able to comprehend the rules and gets comfortable with the game's perplexing iconography, I could see Deadwood being one of the fastest worker placement games ever. Being limited to a single action a turn is similar to Ticket To Ride and play could move like Gangbusters when against veterans of the game.

Instruction booklet could use some editing. Set-up diagram should be on the same page as the description. If each building needs a legend to understand, either the iconography sucks or quick reference cards for each player should be included. A full rewrite of the combat rules needs to be done.

Based off of 5 2-player games and 4 4-player games. I really like this game. Great theme, great components, plays quickly, same artists from the game arcana. It's a worker placement game where you can kill other peoples workers. The theme fits very well. I started off playing this with 2 players which is very enjoyable, but does get better with more players. The more players there are the more conflict there seems to be. This has been my favorite game this year so far.

Worker placement, where the places you place earn you money or allow you to get rid of negative VPs (the wanted posters). You can go where someone else is if you win a dice shootout. Once you've placed, you get no further benefit, so occasionally you need to spend a turn removing your workers so you can re-place them, either on empty spots or initiating new shootouts. Each shootout you start earns you a most wanted poster, and you'll get negative VPs for these at the end of the game based on the geometric scale, so you won't want too many. The game therefore is pretty random and can become king-makery based on who shoots for who and who wins. The decisions aren't that interesting - go here for a $1, or there for a $1 or maybe do a shootout in an attempt to get $2. The shootouts are a bit of dice fun which save the game from monotony admittedly. But this game's probably not one to go searching for - it felt explored after a play and the shootouts aren't enough to sustain the game for repeat play.

RATING: 7
My biggest complaint is that shootouts are soooo frustrating!  It's really tempting to start shootouts in a wild west game.  Fight the urge because it's usually a losing strategy in Deadwood.  1 or 2 well-timed shootouts might benefit you but you should avoid them most of the time.  If you don't fall into the shootout trap then it's a solid worker placement game with a fun theme.

This game died a fast death during my one play. The theme didn't shine through and it was just boring. The attack system didn't work and it was just devoid of fun. Turns were quick, but of little interest. The game played was with a full compliment of 5 players, who had very little time to care about who had how much money. This subtracted from the meaning of the game. Disappointing!

Didn't make the cut, as it just didn't work for me or the group I played it with.

$9

Goal Met :star::star::star::star::star: $1 or less per play

Got it for $9 at Target clearance and after reading somewhat of a more negative reviews on this game, this game was an actual pleasant surprise! The game has it's flaws, but when you are playing with a good group, it is a very fun game. I played my first 3 games 4-players with my brother, sister-in-law, and sister-in-law's brother. We were shooting each other and laughing so hard. The randomness of the dice was not a concern for us and it actually held tension for us. Even though the dice wasn't treating my brother well, he just shrugs it off and kept on playing.

My brother is the one that wins 70% of Dominion games that we play and we all took our revenge on him with this game by shooting his cowboys to the grave. 

I look forward to play this game again.

---- Update ----
Played with 3 players and it is less fun than 4. I think I will only bring this out if there are 4 to 5 players.

Feels vaguely "Magic the Gathering"-y in a way I have a hard time articulating.  It's a lot of special abilities, and using this one to do that over there, and...well, I wasn't too disappointed, but my group was hugely unimpressed.  It ends suddenly, it is pure nastiness in terms of player interaction, and it is difficult to explain the rules.  
These things are pretty much poison in my group.

A worker placement game with a western theme.  The twist on the worker placement mechanic in this game, ends up being it's biggest problem.  Since your henchmen don't get reset without taking the call home action, certain players can squat on certain buildings for the whole game. Sure, you can start a shootout, but starting shootouts ends up being too risky in practice, so nobody wants to be the one to risk it, since the penalty for even starting a fight can be pretty severe even if you win.  Basically they added combat to a non-interesting worker placement game and created a turtling problem. I don't see why I would play this game over Way Out West.

After a single play this was pretty fun.  Expect the rating to change after more familiarity with the game.  It does play really fast for a worker placement style game and is one of the few of that genre that will fit well in a lunch hour.  Unfortunately, it might feel a bit too abruptly ended and seems like it can feel like the end comes just as you started to build up something.

RATING: 6
Dueling is fun and the different abilities of the locations were well thought out and makes for a new experience every time, but turns flow pretty awkwardly as players will spend a lot of turns just reclaiming cowboys and attempting to get rid of wanted posters. It seems this game could last 15 minutes or an hour and a half, which is a hard time slot to plan around.

I would've liked to see some cowboy miniatures instead of the tokens, but the artwork looks good. Still, way too much cardboard in Deadwood.

I got this for my wife for Mother's Day and finally got a chance to play (14 Jun 14).  I definitely think this is not as good as LOW, Yedo, and the Manhattan Project, but that's ok.  This worker placement game plays quickly, and setup/tear down is a very fast.  There are some potential flaws in the game - you can rush the game by annexing Town Hall if you don't defend it.  I also think that it benefits more with more players.  Anyways, this one is a keeper for the foreseeable future.  We both enjoyed the theme and want to play again!

Any concern that this was too similar to Carson City were dispelled early on during the first playing. This is much lighter, faster and has a personality all of its own. This is a very decent shootout worker placement game in a packed mid sized box for a very good price. Loads of fun when played fast.

What really stands out is the excellent combat system. Stronger gunfighters usually get off a couple of shots (dice) before their opponents, but nothing is guaranteed as the excitement builds while the last individual shots are fired off. Excellent, excellent stuff. Fits the nature of gunfighting perfectly.

The distribution of buildings will change from game to game and this will give the game some good legs. Camping out on the sheriff building might work well in one game and fail miserably in another. Certain buildings allow players to perform special actions, such as placing a certain building on top of the building draw stack, or move gunfighters off buildings and out of ranches. Unless the building draw is terribly unfavourable, these buildings will change the nature of the game and give the players some good control of proceedings.

Suspense is maintained to the very end of the game with some highly profitable buildings and building combinations that pay off under the right conditions. This works well to keep everyone in the hunt - even if it is an outside chance.

The only thing I'd like to see changed is the railway graphic design on the board - it should have been a much lighter grey so the railway tiles stand out better. All the symbols can be a bit confusing (so a separate building reference sheet would have been handy), but you can generally learn them as you go as the buildings come out, so it's not too bad.

Not really sure if the Drifter building is correct in the rules or on the tile. The rules say you can remove two gunfighters, but the icon on the tile seems to indicate it's only one. We're playing by the book.

Very pleasantly surprised. I wasn't expecting much and what I got instead was a quick 30-45 minute keeper. Good stuff!

RATING: 7.5
The game is saturated with theme - easily its greatest asset - and the mechanics manifest this theme perfectly.

The rules are fairly easy to grasp as you only have two choices each turn - either (1) play a cowboy or (2) take back cowboys - but there is much complexity in deciding where your cowboy should go as each location will have a certain effect on the game.

We played a five-player game and my one friend absolutely hated the game - he thought some locations were too overpowered (i.e. The Undertaker), some were broken (i.e. The Sheriff's Office), too many opportunities for "king-making", and that it was too easy to force the end game condition as the game could technically end in five turns (one round in a five player game).

Obviously I disagreed. The Undertaker is completely dependent upon peopling fighting otherwise it's worthless, sitting a cowboy at the Sheriff's Office while protected by the sheriff both deprives you of using that cowboy as well as placing the sheriff in a more lucrative location, king-making is not the game's fault but the players as any player in any game could actively try to help another win (and we had one doing just that in our game), and often no one wants to force the end condition as most are not in a position to win (and can even take precautions of prolonging the game by squatting on the Town Hall with a sheriff for protection).

I must confess that the game could be a bad experience if a player purposely tries to make it a sour experience for everyone - and I suppose this game gives that player more opportunities than most to do exactly that - but I simply don't see how the fault lies with the game as any game can be "soured" if a player actively tries to make foolish decisions to throw off the proceedings. In that case, the player is a jerk rather than the game being broken.

This is a simple work placement game with a Western theme.  The game is set in the town of Deadwood.  Players try to get as much money by the end of the game.  You get money by placing your workers on various buildings in the town.  Depending on the building, you may get various benefits (such as money), resources and/or liabilities as well.  Some buildings require you to pay some money for some benefit.

One interesting variant that you find in this game is that you can contest a building already occupied by an opposing player's worker.  Basically, the two workers get into a gun fight and the surviving worker (if any) gets control of the space.  If the active player wins the gun fight, he gets the benefits of landing on the building.  Workers who die in the gun fight are removed from the game and go to the graveyard.  You can get more workers by placing a worker in the saloon and paying the cost of the worker.  The workers with a better gun fight rating costs more money.

The game play is pretty simple.  When it is your turn, you either place a worker or remove at least one worker you have placed.  You usually remove your workers after you have placed them all, so you have workers to place again on your subequent turns.  Sometimes, you don't want to remove all of your workers in order to hinder other players from placing workers in certain buildings.  Also, some buildings have an ongoing benefit, so you may want to leave a worker there.

This game is what I was looking for.  It is a fairly simple worker placement game.  The theme fits with how you play the game and how players contest a building.  When the game ends, you count up all of your money minus penalties for having wanted posters and whoever has the most money wins.  If there is a tie, there is one final shootout amongst all tied players to determine the winner.

Played this in a 5 player game and realized how broken it was very early on. With only 4 pieces of rails to place and then one train station the game can be ended very quickly. I could have ended it after only a handful of turns but held off for the sake of the other players. 

The theme is interesting but unless everyone is in mutual agreement to purposefully avoid ending the game, which is also dumb, it will end very quickly without much need for player interaction.

This is something that seems like it could have been fixed by simply adding an ability to somehow sabotage the railroad.

Light game, quite some luck. And somehow that seemed dumb. One person was blocking the sherif, one was blocking the saloon, for recruiting new cowboys. That spot was blocked from duels by the sheriff. So I couldn't get new cowboys. So I used mine to go and get more bullets and I tried to kill the sheriff with all of them. All of them failed even though I had more dice. And then the game was over. Guess who didn't win?

Deadwood es un loco tablero de juego de colocaci√≥n de Losetas con una vuelta de tuerca mort√≠fera: los Duelos. Hay 3 tipos de cowboys: Novatos, Pistoleros y Cabecillas. Los cowboys entran en la ciudad para intentar controlar sus Edificios y disput√°rselos a otros cowboys en tiroteos. Cada Edificio tiene habilidades √∫nicas que se pueden usar inmediatamente. Los cowboys acceden a estas ventajas controlando esos Edificios. Un jugador que instiga un tiroteo para controlar un Edifico controlado por otro jugador, recibe un cartel de ‚ÄúSe Busca‚Äù (Wanted), que te penaliza al final de la partida. 
Tras la primera partida estas algo despistado ya que no sabes lo que hace cada Edificio y no sabes cual es la mejor estrategia. Los "Duelos" son divertidos y est√°n bien resueltos. Es un juego corto que espero que mejore conforme se aprende.

This is actually a very simple worker placement game that works fine but didn't much appeal to me. It's greatest virtue is it plays quickly - I'd envision most games being well under the advertised hour. We had some questions about which buildings activate and how when railroad pieces are built, and the rules were not crystal clear. I'm sure a FAQ clears that up easily, but I didn't love the game enough to bother looking. Neither the components nor the game play wowed me.

Deadwood is classic Fantasy Flight cardboard mayhem.  The art is gorgeous but there are a million poorly labeled chits and markers.  The tiny icons blur all action types with no distinction; one-time, repeating, and special actions are all marked the same way. The result is a board that is impossible to assess unless you've played Deadwood many times.  You won't.  This is a shame because the gunfight dice mechanic is fast and effective.

My first worker placement Euro, given to me as a gift. The artwork of this game is fantastic, and the theme had me itching to play. However, after our first game (5P), most of the players were less than impressed and the consensus was that we must have played the game incorrectly; combat was infrequent, ideal moves were often obvious, requiring little thought or decision-making, and the game end seemed rather premature and anti-climactic. Some time later I took the time to analyze the rulebook in detail to figure out where we went wrong, only to find that we had in fact played the game properly. My wife and I decided to give the game another shot with 2P, and to our chagrin found the experience much the same as the first. We gave the game one last gasp with 4P and again all players found the experience to be lacking. The main issue appears to be that most players recognize that the game can be ended very quickly by annexing Town Hall repeatedly once a small monetary lead is created. Every game I've played to date has ended prior to many duels being fought or many additional buildings being "built" due to the game being ended prematurely. One small additional gripe is the box insert, which makes it extremely difficult to keep all of the cardboard components separated and organized. 

I really wanted to like this game after seeing the artwork and paging through the rules to get a feel for the theme and mechanics. However, after playing the game, it simply left us with a feeling that there had to be more to the game than what we had experienced. Unfortunately, there's not. At first glance, Deadwood appears to possess all the ingredients of an excellent game, but it simply doesn't feel like one. This game gets a rating of 3 from me due to the obvious strategy of prematurely ending the game, which in effect renders the game broken and results in an entirely unsatisfying experience.

Update: I still believe the game to be "broken" in the sense that those playing for the win will always end the game quickly by repeatedly annexing the Town Hall once a small financial advantage has been gained, often within the first 5-8 turns. This neuters the game experience by ending the game prior to many duels being fought or many new buildings being added to the board, and the issue should have been caught in early playtesting by the game designers. However, I recently stumbled across a suggestion in the Deadwood forums that may "fix" this issue and make the game playable again - implementing a house rule that modifies the victory conditions from simply having the most money, to passing a minimum threshold of $20/$30 AND possessing the most money. This would force the game to last longer and would hopefully allow the main elements of gameplay to make their presence felt prior to game end. May have to give the game another shot with this rule in effect.

This game was ok, but I found it dry and some of the rules were poorly explained and confusing. While I might join in a game, I'd never go out of my way to purchase this.

This is quite a fun little filler game. I think it should be rated a bit higher as it's quick and doesn't outstay it's welcome at all but is quite satisfying for what it is.

Nice theme, but dice play a big role. I don't like it particularly. Things can go out of hand easily. very difficult to come back in the game.

[thing=96713][/thing] is a fine game and the box is misleading: there is a good deal of components in it. The artwork is pretty.

The game can have a lot of player interaction since one player can send his worker/gunsling to take a place occupied by other player worker/gunsling.

[thing=96713][/thing] has some real thematic feel - not overwhelming, but sure it is there.

All in all a good game, but one that doesn't shine enough to be called.

Deadwood is a wild-and-wooly board game with a quick and deadly twist on classic worker placement games. Your gang consists of three different classes of cowboys with different strengths: greenhorns, gunslingers, and trail bosses. Cowboys ride into town to gain control of (annex) buildings and fight other gangs' cowboys in shootouts.

Deadwood is, in essence, a light and unremarkable worker placement game with a fun mechanic to resolve conflicts (by having a shootout). Despite its simplicity, it does take a game to fully understand the intricacies of endgame scoring (triggered when placing the train stration). Too bad the rulebook, which was directly translated from French, leaves one or two essential questions unanswered. Luckily, the author has answered these on the BGG forum. All in all, we had fun playing Deadwood, and it carries its theme very well, but as a worker placement game it all still felt a bit bland to me.

I wondered why this game seemed to be kind of under-rated for what it was, and insanely cheap.  After finally get a play through, I can understand now.  There's a lot of neat little things going on, but the end result of them all coming together is ultimately unsatisfying.  Perhaps if I haven't already played Lords of Waterdeep, which is a similar weight, this would be higher.  

Could be more fun if you had really aggressive players who were constantly doing shoot outs (the most enjoyable part of the game).  Otherwise, the strategy is pretty obvious.

A good game, but very easy to replace.

This is another game in the growing "I can't find anything wrong with it, but I can't find many reasons to play it again, either" category of games, which is a real shame.  The theme begs for it to be a nice Ameritrashy game, but it winds up being a soulless Euro with some decent mechanisms, but not a whole lot to hang it all together.  I wouldn't refuse to play it again, but it's not something I'd ask to play, either.  For those of you with an aversion to dice, I'd recommend avoiding it all together, though.

Deadwood is a lot better than I expected it to be. I had zero interest when it debuted and the reviews I stumbled across didn't do anything to change my disinterest. I ended up getting it with a gift card that I didn't have any other use for. Sort of a consolation prize, if you will. I went into it with zero expectations, but I must say I have been pleasantly surprised.

As it turns out, adding gunfights to a worker placement game makes for a pretty exciting time. The game is pretty simplistic as worker placement goes, but still, the gunfights are so much fun that you don't notice how shallow the rest of the game turns out to be.

It is critical you play this with four or five players, as any less will lead to an empty town and very little reason to fight. Without fighting, the game is just too light to hold anyone's interest.

It's definitely not a perfect worker placement, nor is it really an area control game. The town building mechanisms don't quite gel. The theme absolutely gets through though, and with a group that approaches it as a slightly-more-than-light wild west game it's great. Niche, but strong in its niche.

fantastic worker placement game! I love the theme of the wild west and I think it works very well with the mechanics.  I love the shootouts!  I think it adds so much to the game and its not like other worker placement games where if someone takes that spot you have to wait to move you can just try to kill their guy and take it!  I love how the shootout works!  I love that the more dice you bring you get like a first shot advantage and that rolling 6 is a game changer.  Fantastic game really enjoy it!!

Solid worker placement game with a good western theme.  Extra tenth of a point for good components.

Love the box artwork and size of box. Use of the buildings and them ties up nicelt and I like the components. I like the mechanic of putting on or taking off cowboys. Think it needs a rule change, something like if you have 2 cowboys in play the 3rd must go and have a fight, otherwise the fighting can be a redundant mechanism and it is just a race to pick up $. If get to play again with the above tweak then may rerate up.

Very disappointing.  Seems underdeveloped.  Game felt like it had promise but limited ability for any meaningful confrontation, which negated what seemed like was purpose of game.

Why pretend to provide for confrontation if price far exceeds benefit

I exclusively play this game if beer is involved.  It's a simple worker placement game with a dice based combat system that gets much better if everyone is making gun noises.

A great western game for 3-5 players, when for 2 is less challenging.. It plays fast, has great quality on components and many strategies to choose. And of course, for those who love history, it features the one and only "Gem Saloon", following thematically the original town of Deadwood..

Random.. very random. And mechanisms seems to be not developed at all. A game can be over in one turn or can drag a lot. And a game was not fun at all - we had fun bot not because of the game

We visited the town of Deadwood in 2006. There were gunfights in the streets. Of course it was all show, but it made a big impression to us, as we didn‚Äôt expect any show, and it was the first gunfight we ever witnessed. Deadwood kept floating around in our memories. We were happy that we could find a copy of this game after a couple of years. Now we should be able to have gunfights ourselves in the streets of Deadwood.

After playing the game, we can say we did have our gunfights in the streets of Deadwood. Only less then we expected. Also the luck in these gunfights is huge. There‚Äôs enough tactics in this game, to make it a nice familygame, but it left us with a feeling like ‚Äúis this all there is?‚Äù Only interesting when you have a special relation with the theme. Like we have.

About 6-7 plays with it, I'm still not sure if this game is worth keeping. I'll give it a tentative "6" but with further plays it could get below it making it a trading away item.

It doesn't have much strategy, and with public knowledge of money it's a constant "hammer the leader" game. Not much fun in my book, and my GF totally hated it so...

Update: trading it. I really don't feel any interest in playing it while I have many other games I like much more that would benefit from more table time.

This is an excellent worker placement game that I feel sometimes gets overlooked because it doesn't seem as serious or fulfilling as heavier fare in the vein of Caylus. However, I would play this vibrant, thematic game over Caylus (and Agricola for that matter) any day of the week.

The play length is appropriate, the interaction solid and meaningful - this is a great little game!

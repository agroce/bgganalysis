GAME: Die Macher
RANK: 179
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Die Macher is one of the very few long games that I'd like to play on any given opportunity, and I was hugely impressed by its design since my first play. It's long, but it's complex, not complicated: there are different rule systems mixed together to portray different aspects of your political campaign, but each of them is simple to understand and to manipulate during the game. 
Mastering the whole system takes time, of course, but you'll find yourself grasping its main dynamics much sooner than you'd expect, probably just after you've gone through the first round of play. So, don't let its fame scare you: our first game was with two non-gamers, and they both really enjoyed it. The system is streamlined and functional, the theme is well implemented and you can easily imagine your party going through all the vicissitudes of a political campaign. 
Give it a try if you can :)

RATING: 6
Very good deep strategy game but while I don't mind games of this length, they need have a little less repetitiveness for them to really shine. And the Valley Games implementation is really poor with their choice of card icons which are far too similar. (I also own the original 4p version)

RATING: 6
Great theme, very involved and engrossing game, BUT has some significantly flawed random elements to the game (opinion polls, secret auction for first player).  Also, although this needs more than 1 play to really appreciate/properly rate this game, how likely is it that you're going to get at least 3 people to sit down for another 6-8 hour game again (especially if someone got burned by the randomness of the game the first time)?  Unfortunately, this game will probably be forever retired after 1 play.

I like the theme because it is really unique, but the game time is just too long. Perhaps the new shortplay rules will make it even better. The game mechanics work fine and offer a lot, but it is nevertheless hard to plan everything and so still quite luck dependant.

2010-06-05 (rating 7.5):

I like the game. But it wasn't as heavy as I expected (sadly). Some luck factor, not large but still significant (especially when it comes to polls). But more depends on interactions between players.

This is somewhat strange as the game is way to long for a light, heavy interaction, party game. And yet I didn't feel I had enough influence on the game progress to call it a Diplomacy-kind of game.

But I played it only once and we didn't do much negotiations (sadly).

RATING: 8.5
I've played it. It took 5 hours for 5 of us to march through the game. I really liked it. It never felt slow or bogged down. There's not much room for AP ever in the game. But it is the same game played basically 6 times in a row. Each state is resolved as you peer ahead to the next 3 coming up. At times, you start getting plans laid out and other times, you find you made a mistake. The random 'poll' cards are harsh and scary and frankly, I love 'em. They add spice to an otherwise nearly precise mathematical experience (something I generally do not like in a game). I like the dodge and match game with your platforms vs. opponents vs. the state vs. the national end game. There's really nothing else like the granddaddy of heavy Euros. And there likely never will be. Very fun.

A complex game for true gamers. Very rewarding for those who are willing to invest the time to learn the secrets of Die Macher.

The biggest minus comes from the rather big luck factor for such a long game. Losing a 4 hour game in the last minute just because of bad luck can be quite frustrating.

2016-03-08
It is remarkable how well Die Macher has stood the test of time. Considering the fact that the game was designed back in the mid 80's, it is still very relevant. Of course, you have to admit that the game is not as visually pleasing as you would expect today. It almost looks like a prototype. After a while the table also starts to look very busy.

Once you get past the game's age and looks, you have a solid but heavy strategy game in your hands. Each turn has many steps and is rather complex. There are a lot of things to keep an eye on. Fortunately, there is a fair amount of fluctuation of luck which helps in maintaining the flow of the game. If the Die Macher was purely deterministic, would it surely suffer from too much analysis. Now, since you cannot calculate everything, you can come up with sensible moves within a reasonable amount of time. Of course, very tight games can be decided by chance but usually it is the best player who wins.

Die Macher is definitely not the beast its reputation suggests. There are far heavier and more difficult games out there. Yes, the game is long but you do not need the whole day. A game can be finished in an evening.

A very tentative rating based on one play.  I think I'd like this the more I get to know it.  It has to be said that it's pretty dry and involved, but I felt early on that I had a bit of an idea what I was doing.  For a deep game, there is still quite a lot of luck in it, but I think you can mitigate against most of it if you're careful.

If you have even *heard* about this game you are a real game geek. Possibly the most dull theme ever devised, but it works oh so well. It's such a shame it is so hard to organise games, but enjoyable and tense without fail when we do play.
My favourite game to show non-gamers to scare them!
Even if you are scared of the theme and supposed complexity, give it a chance - I promise you won't be disappointed.
For a 4 hour game, the rules are very easy to teach, since the game occurs in phases (a la Power Grid) and turns.

It is fiddly.  It is long.  It is cluttered with odd mechanisms.  Yet, despite these shortcomings, a Die Macher game starts like a roller coaster ride (slowly building up speed) and then midway through the thrill starts to build up leading to a great payoff.

Truly an exceptional and fascinating game.  It does have a 2-3 turn learning curve (at least for me it did), but thankfully you are not out of the game at that time.  The theme is excellent and integrates well into the game with the national election carrying significant weight at the end.  There is a lot going on here, and I would classify it as a very meaty game - definitely for experienced gamers only as a game can easily go for more than 5 hours.  Negatives are game length - it's hard to find people who are willing to sit down for one game this long, and second, fiddly rules.  And because I don't see this game being played often, constant reference back to the rulebook may be the norm.  Overall though, great game!  If you consider yourself a gamer, you owe it to yourself to give this game a try.

Epic. A great game that really makes you think, and fascinatingly true to its rather strange theme. Its procedural nature makes it rather easy to teach, but still has enough complexity to be far from trivial to master. A fault (for Valley Games edition, at least): The cards are *very* difficult to tell apart - not only across the table, but even in your own hand.

RATING: 8
Sounded very complicated, plus I can't read German. But no matter, as once you start playing it becomes easily understandable, plus everything is picture based so no German is needed (sorry Hans!).
This game plays well, and apart from an unlimited amount of possible votes/seats is a very good representation of the mechanics of politics. Highly  enjoyable, and although competitive not a game you can loose friends over!

Talk about sensory overload. Seeing this board set up and ready to play can be a little intimidating. So many cards, so many wooden cubes, and yet after a round or two everything makes sense. German politics: an interesting way to spend an afternoon.

Influential game based around a series of resource management mini-games. It moves along quickly, but it takes a while to actually finish. I believe enjoyment increases if every player is familiar with strategic games.  I'd like to get another game in, but it's hard to pick this one over some other 4 hour games.  It feels like a once-a-year treat.

My favourite multi-player game. The mechanics blend so well together. This is a MUST HAVE in any collection. The rules are not too difficult (esp. with player aids available on bgg), but the gameplay (ie: how the rules actually relate to each other) is much more difficult. Persevere, DM is awesome!

I've only played with four and five players.  Rich theme, lots to think about, forward planning and picking your fights essential.  A strong suspicion that an early success is vital to build momentum for the win.  The Valley Games edition is very good looking, my only criticism is that the icons for nuclear and economic development are too similar.  I kind of miss the politicians' heads on the shadow cabinet cards from the first edition.

What can I say that hasn't been said already?  Beautiful game, not overly complex game play but the strategies to win certainly are.  I enjoyed the player interaction that this game fostered and the making and breaking of colitions (especially those that were forced) made this game very enjoyable.  The 5hrs that it took to play really flew by.  I am eagerly looking forward to playing this one again and wouldn't turn down the opportunity!!!

This game is nice because it handles a theme that most games would not dare to handle: politics. If you like politics, you like really heavy german-games, and you're willing to sit down 3 to 4 hours, die Macher is the absolute game to play!

Un par de partidas no registradas.

Conceptualmente no es un mal juego, el problema está en que es antiguo y al compararlo con diseños más actuales se ven todas sus errores y carencias.

- La partida es laaaaaarga y acortarla no es posible pq las estrategias son a largo plazo en muchos casos. Si se da un tijeretazo y se acorta el nº de elecciones, el juego pierde gran parte de su jugo.

- La estética de las cartas no es nada intuitiva y francamente mejorable.

- Puede resultar repetitivo pq son varias las elecciones y casi todas son iguales.

- Demasiado conteo de votos. 

- Para un no-alemán con ningún conocimiento de las elecciones en alemania, hay muchas reglas y mecánicas que resultan incomprensibles.

  Creo que para alemanes, y en los inicios de los eurogames, pudo tener su sentido. Ahora, comparándolo con diseños más actuales lo veo anticuado por no decir obsoleto.

RATING 8 

Based purely on playing 2 election rounds with 3 players.

I can see a heavily engaging 5 player game.  I also can see 4-5 hours going by very quickly.

Some of the scores from the session reports are similar to the closeness of the PR endgame.  You are in the game via a number of potential strategies.  Aggressive, coat-tailing, and spoiler are easy paths to take.  You don't really need to plan ahead 4 elections, but you do need to plan for 3 ahead.  Game forces to think in the future!!

Gotta love the forced planned thinking element.

If you only want to worry about your turn, units, etc.  THIS GAME IS NOT FOR YOU.

Pretty enjoyable.  My rating may change the next time I play, since we neither understood what we were doing, nor were playing it correctly.

I've played this game numerous times and it still retains its replayability.  This game never plays the same way twice, the elements of negotiation and strategy make this a classic game.  Its a good length (4-5 hours) that encourages socialization (even if its simply in the manner of, hey, you just screwed me over!)  If you've never played it, grab 4 of your closest gamer friends, several six-packs of german beer (or a couple bottles of wine) and expect a really good evening.

For what it is, this a very good game.  The depth and number of interactions is quite interesting; however, the multiple board rotations and game length detract from the overall experience.

An awesome game that is well worth the investment of time.  First play (not counting a dummy round to get everyone on the same page) took four and a half hours, which is shorter than I had expected. I would never have thought a political game would be remotely as interesting as Die Macher. This game makes me reconsider my ratings for other games.

It think after playing this once I can dub this "The King of Euros".  There are so many mechanics but they are all blended very well into the game.  It's took several rounds for me to begin to appriciate how the game plays and as we were lucky enough to be able to play the game in three hours the game the length seemed appropriate.  At least know I can say I've played it and would gladly join in another game if invited.  I would like to play this a couple of more times before giving it a rating though but at this point I'm pretty sure I can say this IS better than Caylus or Puetro Rico.

4/6/17: A solid 4 hour game. Interesting, but with AP folks this could really slow down.  At the end bidding for polls gets exponential because there is nothing else to spend money on, and a bad one can hurt you at a critical time.  Also trying to change your stance on issues, can be very frustrating.  Towards the end everyone converges on the same stance on issues as you don't want to be an outlyer.

The luck factor felt higher than I'd like it it to be, which usually isn't a complaint for me, but I guess that's the point of multiple election cycles, to even things out.  Probably also with additional playing you learn how to manage and minimize adverse events.

I do not like the iconography of the Valley games (3rd) edition.  It is hard to distinguish the symbols from across the table.  I may need to make alternate cards for my copy of that edition.

5 players is really the best way to play this game.  Also consider doing just 5 election cycles rather than 7.

Only one game so far, and while I did poorly (less than half the final score of what the winner achieved) I do want to play again.
A second game played and I still lost, but was behind the winner by only as many points as I'd been behind fourth in my first game.
It is important to be involved in almost everything it seems, which can be frustrating for how you get to spread resources. It's not always wise to accept a coalition either, I basically gave an opponent points by agreeing to his offer in one of the elections.

Would rate higher if not for the time required.

A wargame-eket nem számítva az ismertebb (legalább 30 szavazatot kapott) játékok közül a második legnehezebb játék jelenleg a Die Macher a BGG-n(a Magic Realm után). Ezek tudatában már kb. 1 éve készültem kipróbálni a szekrényben lapuló példányt, nagyon kíváncsi voltam, miben rejlik a nehézsége. Emellett szerettem volna megismerni már csak amolyan általános műveltségi okokból is ezt a legendás darabot. A szabályból már sejtettem, hogy nem lesz könnyű. Kb. 1 órámba telt ismertetni a többiekkel. Nem rövid a szabály, de a komplexitást nem a szöveg hosszúsága adja, hanem az, hogy minden mindennel összefügg, és ebből rettentő bonyolult döntési helyzetek adódnak. A játék taktikai elemek tömkelegét is kínálja (egyszerre befolyásolni tudunk akár 4 különböző időpontban kiértékelődő választást is), de az eredmény a nemzet táblán dől el végérvényesen, oda pedig stratégiai gondolkodás is szükséges. Mindenre van válaszlépés, minden számításunkat keresztül tudnak húzni, van olyan akció, amit 3 féle módon is végre lehet hajtani (pl. médiabefolyás szerzése). A szerencsefaktort a kockák ellenére igen csekélynek érzem. Nem tudom, hány parti kellene, hogy tudatosan felépítve tudjam játszani, de elsőre örültünk, hogy a szabályokat helyesen tudtuk alkalmazni. Igazi brutál hardcore gémer játék, szerintem aki kicsit is komolyan társasjátékozik, egyszer próbálja ki:) Elrettentő lehet, hogy a játék témája a politika (Németországban kell választást nyerni a pártunkkal), de szerintem pont az a jó a a játékban, hogy a témához tényleg nagyon kötődik, megpróbálja nagyon pontosan a valós dolgokat lemodellezni. Egyrészt emiatt, másrészt a kora miatt (1986-os) nagyon egyedi, nem a mai divatos mechanizmusok köszönnek vissza benne, igazi unikumnak tekintkthető. A nagyon erős mechanizmust talán csak a téma szárazsága húzza le kicsit, meg a hosszú játékidő, de szerintem néhány parti után igazán élvezetes lehet. 
A játék kivitelezése profi, a tábla és a kártyák is tökéletesen nyelvfüggetlenek.

Röviden összefoglalva: kiugró darab, de az erőssége (komplexitás) egyben a gyengesége is:)

Játszanék még vele!

A szabaly attanulmanyozasa kicsit (?) elrettentheti a jatszani vagyot - ugyanis nem egy "Ki nevet a vegen?" fajsulyu jatek...
Annyira egyedi, osszetett, es fordulatokban bovelkedo a jatekmenet, ami joggal emeli ki a "tucatjatekok" garmadai kozul!
Hosszu (nagyon hosszu), szovevenyes es szerteagazo ut vezet a gyozelemhez.
Van benne tobbsegi resz, szovetsegkotes, bloff, licit, es persze szerencse.
Merteke - tobb jatekot kovetoen batran kijelenthetem - szamomra mar boven, a "nem toleralhato!" kategoriaba esik. Azert ez egy kicsit elszomorito...
Kicsit komolytalannak erzem, egy ilyen kaliberu jateknal a velemenykartyak "vakrepuleset"...!

Ami kevesbe tetszik:
1. hiaba elvezetes, de rettentoen hosszu a jatekmenet. (7 tartomany eseten 5,5h jatekido!)
2. csak gyakorlott jatekosok tarsasagaban erdemes neki kezdeni.
3. a jatekszabaly ismertetesebe, annak hosszusaga miatt nem szivesen fog bele a jatekmester.
4. surun kell jatszani vele, mert nehezen veszi ra magat a jatekos a szabalyok, es a jatekmenet ujboli, reszletekbe meno felidezesere.
5. a szerencse tulzott szerepe egy ilyen osszetett jatek eseten.
6. a jatekmenetet tartalmazo szabaly allando bongeszese a fazisok sorrendje miatt.
7. a kartyakon talalhato abrak nemelyike siman osszekeverheto.

Amiert viszont zsenialis:
1. tobb ut is vezet a gyozelemhez.
2. hihetetlenul kiegyensulyozott - soha nem vagy elegge lemaradva ahhoz, hogy jo eredmenyt erjel el.
3. a jatekban elofordulo mechanizmusok...!

Szoval akkor milyen jatek is a "Die Macher"? - nagyszerű, fordulatos, es nem art ha a szerencse partfogoltja vagy... 
A "hibai" ellenere, nalam a 10 legjobb jatek kozott van a helye! 
(En neha meg napokig elmelkedem arrol, vajon mit kellett volna maskent tennem a legutobbi partiban...)

Ujrajatszas - ha meg emlekszem a jatek apro reszleteire - azaz surun jatszva -, akkor gondolkodas nelkul belevagok..., egyebkent..hmmm!

Ujrajatszas II - Azt hiszem ez marad a vegso pontertekelesem! (7.5->9->8.5)
A balszerencse olyan mertekben erintett meg az elso "7 tartomanyos" jatek kozben, ami egy ilyen fajsulyu jatek eseteben mar bosszanto, es nem toleralhato...!!!
A velemenykartyak a jatek vezerfonala, es csak apro korrigalasokkal tudsz elni, ha a velemenykartyaid alapjaiban kulonboznek azoktol, amiktol sikert remelhetsz! 
Mar pedig a velemenykartyakat kiosztasat a vakszerencse iranyitja.
Viszont valtozatlanul tetszik, hogy hihetetlenul kiegyensulyozott a jatek. 
A lemaradott jatekosnak is komoly sansza van a gyozelemre eselyes jatekos megszorongatasara.

Outstanding. I don't know how else to describe this game. There are never enough resources to do everything you'd like (or even need) to do well in every stage of the game and it's these agonizing decisions that everyone needs to make that keep the game a toss up until the very end.

RATING: 6
First Game:
I was very excited to play the game after seeing Scott's presentation of the game in Boardgameswithscott.com.  It played very differently from what I had imagined the game play would flow.  Seems just like an area majority game where you try to get a piece of the pie all of the time.  Seems like as long as you do ok with the votes you will be fine.  It kinda feels like Princes of Florence how the extra 3 points from making the best work is so key that you pretty much revolve your game around it, but here it is all about getting your media marker and public opinion up in the national board.  I just thought there would be more manuevering and back door political shenanigans.  I don't know.  I will try more and see how the game goes.

RATING: 5
Played once as a 5-player game after extensive study of rulebook.  We played the Valley Games' 5 Round variant.  This session still took 4 total hours for rules explanation and playing time.  

My first impressions were sort of lackluster.  I definitely see the good in Die Macher, but there is a lot of luck thrown in for a 4-hour game!  Dice rolls for party membership can result in huge swings in collected income and endgame points.  I also am not a big fan of Coalitions for if you are the odd man out due to sheer luck of the party Platform draw, you lose.

The production quality is horrible.  The symbols on the cards are difficult to see from across the table.  I "fixed" this problem by using stickers.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It takes a game to get your head around everything that's going on, but after that Die Macher is the most fun 'long' game I know. I think the most notable thing about it, being a rather long game, is that there is absolutely no down time. It really manages to keep you constantly involved. It is also surprisingly fun for a heavy game, with just the right balance of control and luck/chaos.

Highly recommended.

Die Macher features stunningly disparate game mechanisms, jumbled into a procedural nightmare, baked and fried into a 4-5 hour game that's like nothing else out there. This could easily go down to 7. I didn't enjoy the luck elements, but even worse was the tedious walk through every step of the round. A streamlined, elegant rules set would make this a better game, but it also might take away a lot of what gives the game character. For now, though, I am fascinated with all of the interlocking parts, even if it does make Die Macher a bit of a Frankenstein's Monster.

First Play: Watched board game with Scott and had detailed explanation pre-game which helped enormously but I don't think anything can prepare you for the next 5 hours.

It is without doubt a detailed and clever game, certainly heavy but there was for me a drowning sensation as I was unable to take opportunities,  and watched the other players racking up scores that I missed out on time after time.

Half way through and I have to admit that I wasn't enjoying myself. I felt like a spectator as others formed coalitions, restructured the policies and seemed to be sculpting the game in their prefered form while I tagged behind. With hindsight my policies seemed to be out of step with the others but either through inexperience or bad luck, I never shared 3 common policies with any other player.

Being a hater of dice I really disliked the roll of the adjusted die (0-3) to add seats. As seats score points this makes a massive difference and I would gauge a difference of 10-15 points between players that is no more than a lucky bonus. The bidding for the opinion pole is also a major lottery. I appreciate that you need to win it to ensure bad results don't fall your way, but frequently optimum results fell to one player whilst others were left with little choice but to enter the second lottery with the dice and the seats bonus.

In summary, I'm confused as to whether I like it or not. On the plus side its deep and theres alot going on. On the negative there is far more luck than I am happy with and so much of the game seems out of your control. 

Post Script: With so many new and better games to play I have traded this on and down rated to a 6.

I am in constant amazement at how incredible this game is. To think that it was designed in the 80's is just a testament to how innovative the system is. Please note I have the 1st edition, which supports 3 or 4 players. Every little mechanism in the game feels like a political machination in your grand design. From adding meetings (cubes) to recruiting your Shadow Cabinet to setting up Coalitions, it just works. Not easy to teach by a long shot, so expect your first game with new players to be a 4-5 hour slogfest of rules corrections. But after that, you are ready to roll. 80's German politics were never so fun! An easy 10 for me and one of the greatest games I have ever played.

Four playings, one with 5 players and three with 4.  This is a pretty tight little game, 4 or 5 hours straight where you are involved (and thinking) just about every second.  I like it but the theme and dryness keep me from really desiring to play it.  Its not luck free, but the luck factors don't appear to unbalance the game.  I have noted that others' comments on how powerful the last round is appear to be true (in at least three of our games, the player who won the 7th election won the game.  It is worth noting, however, that in those games that player ALSO had the highest Party membership, but the ability to shape the national issues also appears to be very important).

Truely excellent game - such deep strategy and so many choices to make all the time.  Almost no downtime for any player as everyone is always invloved at all stages of the game.  The only thing I would mark it down for is the fact that you have *so* much stuff to think about and keep track of, which wouldn't usually be such a bad thing but in this case you have to repeat the same thing seven times over at least four hours.  Still an excellent game though - one of the best I've ever played.

First game played 11/25/06. Was FDP (yellow). Did Ok on the Mandate, screwed up the National Media and did lousy on the the Membership. Did best on Matching Votes with highest score and bonus. But one cannot screw up two whole scoring categories and expect to do well. I came in last. I was all over the map, but I learned what things do and what they don't do. Next time I'll aim forMandate: 200 pointsNational Media: 75Membership: 75Matching Votes: 75For a total of 425 points. That would probably be enough to win.

I was a bit surprised on my first play of this old classic. Given the hype from heavy Euro gamers, I was expecting something a little different.

 I really enjoyed the challenge and the interesting decisions that have to be made. There's a lot of food for thought on this one. What took me for a surprise was the amount of luck and volatility that I experienced given the length and weight of the game. One card alone can swing the score significantly. It reminded me a bit of Dominant Species; although I thought that Dominant Species' chaos can be mitigated better.

I'm wondering if this game came out today would it still hold up as a classic...

Anyways, because these are musings based on a first play, I want to get it to the table again to confirm my thoughts and to give it the chance it deserves. There's a lot of interesting things going on in this game and I'm wondering if a neophytes view is clouding my opinion and what seems luck and chaos turns into something that can be controlled. 

Still, I'm going with a provisional rating of 7.5 due to my enjoyment of the game and the opportunity for clever play. Also, for the fact that despite it's long playtime, time passes by quickly as you are very involved in the game.

Finally got a chance to play it. A bit steep on the learning curve, but once rolling was great fun. Lots to do and LOTS to think about. Hindered a tad IMO by the randomness of a few aspects and by a common problem of early mistakes costing you too much. The length keeps it from being a 9 in my book, but still a great game, a classic for a reason.

My favorite political game and 4-5 hour playing game.  A gamer's game.  This is a completely unique game and should be in every serious gamers collection.  Make sure you have 4 to 6 hours and 4 friends that can devote the time to this game.  This game does not disappoint.  A hint - Do not underestimate the importance of the one who is setting himself up to win the last two elections.  He who wins these two elections will have the final say on the National Agenda, and thus be in the best position to score many VPs.

OK, so I can say I have played it. Over an hour for the rules and a further 5 hours to play but I have played it. To be fair, second time out it might only be 3-4 hours total. It is a very good, very heavy game with rather more chaos than you might expect for a game this long and intense. Ultimately however, there are games which give you exactly the same in 2-3 hours on first play so I would rather play two of those than one of this - can't see myself rushing back to this one.

I'd been wanting to play this game for a long time, and when I finally got the chance, I wasn't disappointed. There's so much going on and a lot to think about, but it all fits with the theme, and after a couple of rounds the rules make sense, though it's still difficult to know what to do for the best outcome. The game is long, but it doesn't feel that long, as each election is exciting and there's much anticipation going into each round. Long-term plans are a must. You have to focus on just some of the elections into which to pour your resources, while trying to eke out what you can from the others on minimal investment. My biggest problem was forgetting that I had a limited number of cubes to place. I won the game, but I won only two elections (one in a coalition that was forced on me), but I also scored a full 50 on another (but was beaten by a coalition). I had way more party membership than anyone else, which is what gave me the win. Winning the first election helped, too, even though it was the smallest of the game (26 seats, of which I got only 13 or so) because it gave me early positioning on the national board, which turned into lots of points through matched policies and media control.

A five hour game should not feel this short, but Die Macher, amazingly, never seems to drag or overstay its welcome. It's filled with a surprising number of random elements for a euro, but it lets everyone know about them with enough lead time to allow for strategic and not just tactical decision-making. More importantly, it lets the core of the gameplay be about player interaction and trying to outmaneuver your opponents. Euros often get smeared as "multiplayer solitare" and here is the ultimate counter example.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Finally I play the holy grail of heavy Euro games and as often seems inevitable, it is disappointing.  I hesitate to lump this in with Euro games, after all it arrived in the 80s, long before the Germans started pumping games out in bulk, it is far longer and more complicated than any Euro before or since and because it is themed extremely well.  

I think the high praise on BGG stems from what I dub Final Fantasy 7 syndrome.  For many people who entered the hobby through lighter Euro games, this is the first experience with a heavy game outside of the normally scorned wargame and it will no doubt impress a jaded gamer tired of the many rehashed mechanics dumped on the market.

However, rather than gaining, as I hoped it would, from its dual citizenship in the German and American gaming heritage, it suffers from it.  We have a long and complicated game that is just as restricting and just as familiar as most Euros.  How can a game about politics actually have so little politicking?  The game has all the trappings of a great politically themed game, but it in fact missed the most interesting and vital parts.  I still haven't come to terms with how a coalition is more a means to piggyback on another's success than parties with a similar platform cooperating to thwart their more divergent political adversaries.

When actually playing the theme loses importance as you grow bored with the complete lack of narrative.  Very little actually builds up as you play the game, so all 6 rounds are very similar.  Which just doesn't cut it for a three hour game.  For that time length I want something more lasting and memorable, not your average Euro stretched out longer.  Because that is what Die Macher really is, your average Euro trying to extend beyond its humble origins and failing.

Heavyweight political game, but once you get in to the swing of it, the rules are not as complicated as you might think. The game rounds repeat a few times so once you have got to grips with the game process, you'll find that same process repeating until you start to thin out the remaining regions to campaign in, thus eventually ending the game, when all votes are in. 

The mechanics ensure that you cannot dominate every region and although there are some random elements to factor in (opinion polls and the like) these are exactly the sorts of things that may appear in a real electoral campaign. You won't dominate every region and you won't get screwewd in every region. I like the way that you can bank some early impact in a region (before the vote takes place) to guarantee yourself votes. This usually won't guarantee that you win the region but it can put other players off or make you a strong force in a coalition. These votes can't be reduced by a sudden swing against you. If 2 players reach 50 votes (the maximum possible) then the second player to reach 50 win by a nose - another cunning game mechanic which makes control of turn order vitally important.

This will take you 4 or 5 hours to play though, so you have to be committed to the game before you start.

Surprisingly captivating game based (loosely) on the German political system. Seven regional elections are waged by up to five different political parties. Resources are devoted to generating political activity (meetings) influencing public opinion through the media and adjusting political platforms to reflect regional/national agendas. The winner is the one who steers his party most successfully through the maze of elements that make up this game. From the theme, you would think this game would have only limited interest, but it is so cleverly constructed that it captured me from the very beginning and, despite being a longish game, held my interest throughout. Excellent game, the longish playing time being the only negative!

Thought I'd like this more than I did :( Very long and it needs the players all to understand the game for it to work - randomly doing stuff isn't going to work in this game, you need to look at the current state and the future boards and plan your very limited actions carefully. Major thing I disliked was the exchange pool - being fixed at 6 cards and it is pretty static, if you have a hand of cards that doesn't really fit with the rest of the game there isn't much you can do if all you have in the pool are similar :( Wouldn't be a problem if the game was (much) shorter.

RATING: 6
Die Macher is a game about elections in Germany played over 7 rounds where each player represents a political party.  At the end of each round, one of 7 regions is scored with players receiving VPs and money based on how many seats they've received in that region.  At the end of the game, players receive additional VPs based on party membership and how well they match the national opinions.  

The crux of the game are the 7 political issues.  Each player's tableau has 6 cards that show the players in favor or opposed to 6 of the 7 issues.  Each region has a table of 4 cards showing it in favor or opposed to 4 of the 7 issues and the national stage has a tableau of 5 cards showing it in favor or opposed to 5 of the 7 issues.  While players start with their 6-card tableau face up, the other tableaus are built/revealed over time.  There are several mechanics for changing the cards in the tableau but in general, they change slowly.  When a region scores, players score money and VPs based on their party meeting investment multiplied by the net # of issues they match plus a player-specific, region-specific modifier.  While all players get money and VPs, the winner also gets additional VPs and gets to place 1 or 2 cards in the national tableau (potentially swapping out cards already there).  

The game, published in 1986, is a classic with a lot of moving parts, multiple types of auctions, and benefits and costs for going early/late in turn order.  The game takes a while to explain (30+ minutes) and a long time to play (our first play was 7+ hours although rumor has it that it should take around 4 - 5 hours).  

There is a fair bit of randomness.  Players are only able to change their tableau based on cards they draw.  If they don't draw cards that match the popular issues, they can't take those positions.  In addition, adjustments to party membership are done with die rolls and rolling well or poorly can have a significant impact. Next, there are incremental auctions for opinion polls (one per region) each round.  The opinion polls let people adjust two player-specific, region-specific modifiers or their own party membership.  The cards are face-down when bid for and may or may not help the player who won them.   With all that said, the randomness is mostly manageable and is well within most player's comfort even for a game of 4+ hours.  

Very unusual for a game this old, there is very little downtime.  By breaking a round down into lots of phases and players involved in each phase, players are constantly involved.  There is also a lot of opportunity for clever play.  Player can make promises and form coalititions but promises are not binding and even players in coalitions can screw each other.  

Despite the level of randomness, I really enjoyed my first play and am anxious to get to play it again.  After one play, provisional rating is an 8 with movement of up or down 1 very possible.

An enigmatic game.Simply so many fiddly details and such a long time to play that it stands out and doesn't get played much in our groups because it needs dedicated game enthusiasts to enjoy it with time on their hands.

Having said that it's a lot of fun to play, in spite of the many abstractions and frankly lousy artwork (in the most recent edition) that makes it very difficult to distinguish policies.

I can't quite understand it's apparent popularity and high ranking here, but concur that it's got enough character and random complexity to make for a jolly fun time when played with the right folk. We just laugh a lot at the very unjust blind auction of opinion poll results!

Played 8/30/2008

Pulled this out at TCEP and had a full table, but not enough time to commit to playing a full seven rounds, so we agreed to play only five.

Rules took a LONG time to get through, and I had the 'Board Games with Scott' video to explain everything. Now that I've played, it may be easier to explain the procedural processes and go from there.

Takes a LONG time, it's fun, but the time commitment problem may prevent this from getting a lot of air time.

Interesting first play.  I started off strong, then made a few critical mistakes and got completely shut out of the last two elections (102 votes total!), relegating me to next-to-last place.

Reasons why the game is not a straight 10:
- card design and iconography. It is not clear and several symbols are very alike. This feature can be easily fixed with a huge redesign.
- the last 2 states: no time to react. Many points can fluctuate because of this, you can not influence.
- in the national board, the points for the national policies in common with your party policies are too strong. Many points are given away in the last 2 states where you can influence.
With a redesign, the game is a solid 9.5

In a word - the granddaddy of the euros

Investment Required - fairly high: it will take a few sessions to understand the game objective; the rules are quite weighty, also

Return - substantial: conveys some sense of electoral politics, though its integration is pretty mechanical; also, the game certainly features more strategic depth than the typical euro

Co-dependency - moderate (there is plenty of negotiation, but a weak player is likely to be marginal in a five-player session)

Compares to . . . Tammany Hall, which I believe provides a better return.

What a satisfying gaming experience.  A game I'd love to play more of.  Just don't get stuck on the wrong end of the opinion polls or it'll be a very long game for you.  When you look at the rule book it looks like one or two too many sub systems to ever work well together but the magic is that they do - and you won't do well unless you  understand how.  The definitive example of a game where the adjective 'teutonic' is 'le mot juste' - or whatever the German equivalent is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I keep waffling my rating a bit on this one, between a 7 and an 8. I really like the challenge of the game, all the tough and interesting choices it confronts you with, and the fact that it feels really thematic as you try to figure out which regions your party will run well in and how you can change your party platform to please the voters. What I don't like is the fact that the luck of the draw on the polls and the platform cards seems a bit too heavy given the weight and length of the game.

On the one hand, thematically, these luck elements feel right. You shouldn't be able to arbitrarily change your party's platform all the time, and voters are often unpredictable. But, this is a long game (5-6 hours), and one with a lot of energy and emotional investment, and yet one that can turn on a single poll card or getting good platform draws. I guess I just wish the game were just a bit shorter. At 5 hours, this is the same length as Revolution, Successors, or Civilization (with 5), and I don't feel that it's nearly as rewarding as those games.
---
Note: We always play with a house rule that if the 80-seat region comes out in the initial 4 elections, we replace it. This region (which was added in the 1996-ish Hans-im-Gluck reprint and not the original) could, and probably should, be removed from the game.
---
Edition Note: There are now 3 versions of the game, the original (and now very hard-to-find) Moskito edition, the updated Hans-im-Gluck version, and the Valley Games reprint of the Hans-im-Gluck edition. The big differences are between the Moskito and HiG versions; the latter version supports a fifth player, has fewer restrictions on the parties, and a couple other minor rule changes I don't specifically recall. The Valley Games version has updated issues and slightly more internationally-friendly cards.

Probably the Hans-im-Gluck version is the best; it's graphically the most professional and functional (some of the CG illustrations in the Valley Games version are cheesy), and while there is German on some of the cards, it's not a big deal. The Valley Games edition is of slightly lower printing quality and some of the symbols on the issue cards are strange (although some of the complaints I've heard seem overblown). The Valley Games version does have a more sensibly-sized box, though!

Definitely a bunch of difficult decisions packed into a great game design.  Managing your campaign is no easy task, and the multitude of choices lead to a fairly meaty game.  

The one problem some people might have is that there is a lot of luck involved, and some of the luck can be pretty brutal if it doesn't go your way.  It's a bit of a stark contrast to the otherwise somewhat heavy feel to the game, but I happen to find the luck more fun than frustrating (although it can certainly be frustrating to have plans wiped out by the flip of a card).

However, it's not the monster I was expecting, as I've had 5 newbies get through a full game in 3.5 hours.  Definitely playable on a normal game night.

Flawless design. Beautifully balanced, tension-filled, crafty gaming from the moment you start right up to election day. Timeless.

I've heard it said that Die Macher is a game about calculation. I disagree. In my experience Die Macher is played on instinct. There's no calculation you can do which tells you where to put a media token, or when to play a party conference. You do it, or don't do it, but I've never met anyone who tried to 'figure it out'.
I've won many games and never calculated a thing.

Maybe that's a product of the era in which it was released. At the time we were playing Civ, Britannia, Kingmaker. We played Die Macher and it was clearly a different animal. I believe it still is.

RATING: 8
Die Macher is the best election/political game I've encountered and does a really good job in portraying a year of German electoral campaigns (save of course that for the purposes of the game party platforms are readily changeable). There is plenty of room for clever play. Definitely an ambitious gamer's game and a deserving classic.

My first game clocked in at round four hours - sadly seeing the CDU I championed (and favour also in real life) not establishing Adenauer-like political hegemony. We had lots of fun playfully sniping away at each other's parties and agendas. If you're into that, you'll definitely find this game anything but dry and abstract.

However, at four hours, it's really longer than it really wants to be. Okay, I can see this being a three hour game with people more familiar with the game, but in my view a shorter variant covering fewer electoral campaigns would be a good idea. Struggle of Empires - a game of similar complexity and ambition - clocks in at round three hours. A bit of streamlining (and decreased play time in consequence) might have helped getting Die Macher regular to the table.

Still, it is still easily playable in an evening, so it's not that big an issue (from what I had read I thought it takes longer). More of a good thing, really. And the benefit of these longer games is that those - rarer - plays are far more memorable than your typical game of Puerto Rico & Co.

[14/12/05] Played a second time and enjoyed it thoroughly. Yet let me say that income rises too much in the game, leading to fabulous sums of money spent on auction - thereby dwarfing all other forms of expenditure. This is a shame since a financially tigher game would add another decision layer which doesn't really come into its own here. Moreover, in real life parties are pretty broke at the end of a campaign. The reverse happens in Die Macher. One of those loose ends in this game's design. As said, Die Macher ain't perfect, but it's a very fine game nonetheless.

Wow. I don't think there's much I can say that hasn't already been said about this game other than I love it! Just wish Valley Games had made some better choices in terms of graphic design but it is their first go at this.

UPDATE: I've noticed a lot of newer players asking lately whether this game is best with 3, 4, or 5 players. Some have answered that it's better with 4 or 5 players due to the emphasis that having more players has on coalitions. Having now played one 3 player game and one 4 player game, I'd actually suggest new players start with 3 players. The reason is that new players will be busy enough learning how the game works and what the relative importance of each mechanic is that they won't be able to use coalitions to much effect anyways. Furthermore, a game with 3 players will simplify the board, making it easier to analyze and allowing the game to move more quickly.

Even among more experienced players, I'd guess coalitions are not that easy to form and they don't seem to impact a given round *that* much anyways. There is a lot of player interaction in this game but this isn't a diplomacy game. Die Macher seems to do well with any number of players and I suspect that doesn't change even as players gain more experience.

Great theme, and the gameplay is deep and interesting.

I find it amazing this game was published in 1986. Ahead of its time is selling it short. There are a lot of mechanisms interacting together - beautifully. Everything makes sense thematically.

I think it might upset some gamers in that there are swings of fortune, that while planning can help, are beyond your control. In a four-hour game, I guess that could frustrate some people. But I found reacting to these changes the most fun part. It has the feel of political scrambling, which is great. 

This game has so many multi-layered decisions and deep meaningful interaction with other players. Can't say I will play this more than a handful of times in my life, but that's OK. A classic.

Check out BoardGameswithScott.com for an excellent video on how to play. I prefer the yellow Hans im Gluck 2nd edition to the 3rd edition Valley Games reprint with its confusing issue cards (some poor design decisions here - the defence, industry and nuclear power cards in particular). Some illustrations on the boards would also have made it look less abstract. Despite looking as dull as ditchwater this game is a fun experience but does have a lot of randomness in it (face down regional opinions, drawn cards for your party platform, poll cards, rolling for party membership) so doesn't necessarily reward good play. A rule for awarding points for money at the end of the game needs to be incorporated otherwise the last auction just goes to the richest player (dividing by DM5000 and round down would be about right).

I have now played this game a number of times.  A very interesting system.  It is very "full" (lots of tasks) to it takes someone with a wargamer background to be able to last.  But every action by another player effects your own issues so is it like you are participating in another's turn.

Often when I have played this game two if not three of the players were new to the game; though some had tried to learn the rules in advance.  The first game I played took six hours as well as the second game; the third took seven hours.  In a forced game I could see going five hours but it is far nicer to pace one's self and just say it will take six (it has taken this long even with all players having played before).

It seems that the actual playing time can be faster, but when rules & setup time are added, this is a long game.

It is not super complicated as much as there are many steps in every turn making the process take time.  Those new to the game get the grasp of it enough to make their decisions after one or two rounds (of six); though in every case they would have wanted to try things diffently if played again.  THIS GAME IS MUCH BETTER WITH THE HELP SHEETS THAT CAN BE FOUND HERE AT BGG; they keep track of all the steps.  I do think it takes playing once or twice in order to get the management of money & resources down so that a stratagy could be followed better during playing.

It is a most interesting way to set up an election game, still making me think the same format could be used to represent the primary process in American presidential elections.

I also have a copy of the original "blue box" edition which has only four parties and seems a little different in its structure. (I have never played this version.)

I also have the newer Valley Games printing but find the shorter five turn version ruins the game.

Wonderful, deep, fine - kind of like good Barolo, this one is better with age. Perfect blend of old-school depth/length with new-school elegant interlocking mechanics. And the theme is cool, too. REALLY glad I made the investment. Based on 2 plays, both solitaire - says alot about a game, eh?

Its good.  Take whole bunch of great mechanisms and add a scoresheet that balances them all in the right way and you pretty much have Die Macher.  Area Majority, Blind Auction, Open Auction, Set Collection, Alliances, Decisions, Strategy with Tactics and random elements that don't really decide who wins, but do change the game.  Definately worth playing even at its intimidating ruleset and playing time.  The time really does fly by when engaged in this classic.

Dry, incomprehensible to non-Germans, perhaps the biggest letdown of any German game I've ever bought.  Boring subject and had no idea what was being simulated.  On the positive side, at least I don't have to deal with this confusing electoral system in real life, since I don't live in Germany.  Nobody liked it at our table.  Sold.

A four-five hour game that feels like a one and a half hour game it is so constantly exciting. The desicions are really tough. You do feel like a cold-blooded manipulating politician grabbing votes without believing in any of your policies. It's great to see people smearing their opponents, playing the media and forcing empty coalitions against their opponents wills. Brilliant game.

I think it will end up a solid 6 or 7 for me. I felt that the landscape of the platforms/will of the people changed a bit to dramatically and the luck of the poll cards was just a bit too tough. I didn't mind having to buy the poll card of a region you were competitive in RIGHT now, but it dampened the desire/ability to actively work later regions because then you'd have to buy those every time until they were resolved. I'm not generally opposed to a bit of luck, but this seemed a bit much for such a long and heavy game. That said, I enjoyed it considerably as an 'experience' game. Very glad to have played.

First was a wonderful experience!  The length of the game will make it a little tough to get out, though.  I can usually find someone to play the longer two-player wargames, but longer multi-player games are more difficult.  Still, this is on the high end of a short list (along with Struggle of Empires) if I can get the right people together.  Very much looking forward to the time I can play this again.  Even played rarely, still worthy of a high rating.

:tobacco: :( :( :what: :) :D If "being actually entertaining for the entirety of its playing time" is a decent heuristic for rating a game that runs close to four hours, than Die Macher is worthy of a pat on the back. There's little downtime in this joint, and a lot of room for clever play. The theme (state-level parliamentary elections in Germany -- yay?) may be a turnoff for some but I loves me some politics-as-theme.

My maiden voyage with Die Macher left me with a less than savory taste in my mouth; the possibility exists, especially with new players, of the game (four hours, recall) being decided by one player being overly generous to another and in so doing throwing it to him/her. This happened in this case. Not sure how you [i]avoid[/i] that in a game that is by necessity highly interactive, complex in multiple dimensions, and multi-player. Obviously good play will reduce the extent to which people blatantly (but inadvertently) spike the wheels.

My instinct after playing was to compare it to Dominant Species, which is a mechanically different game but has a similar play time, similar level of complexity and the same tension between taking actions that will be of immediate benefit in the near term vs. taking actions that will be resolved in the more distant future -- actions which are more speculative (because less information), but also with a higher risk-reward amplitude (again because less information and more opportunity for your fellow players to mess with you.)

It's worth noting (but probably not worth having a cow over) the fact that the graphic design of the Valley Games edition is marred by some inexcusably terrible choices -- setting aside the use of Comic Fucking Sans for everything, the real sin is the muddy, indistinct, similar looking icons for things that are supposed to be seen quickly on small cards when viewed from across a table. If only there was some clear, distinct, immediately noticeable, more or less universally recognized icon that connoted "nuclear power." That would be terrific.

RATING: 6
Rating after one play.  Is almost certainly going to go up to 8 or down to 6 after another couple games (update: my basic lack of interest in getting a group together for this again can be blamed partially on the graphic design but primarily on the game itself, and until I play it again it's down to a 6).

Huh, this is a funny one.  Initial feeling about the game is that it's too light for its length.  The other heavily procedural game I'm familiar with, Dutch Dutch Revolution, strikes the balance right and makes me feel like almost every of the roughly 100 decision points in the game matters.  Here, I felt that about 50% of my choices were relatively obvious ones, and only about 10% required a really long think.  Due to a couple of beginner's mistakes (mostly regarding media markers), I also spent a lot of time feeling helpless and hopeless waiting for this steamroller of a game to arrive at a point where I could jump back into the action.

The good news is that this is an 'experience' game that really does deliver.  Every one of us felt immersed for the duration (about 5.5 hours).  It is without a doubt a really, really fun game.

Unfortunately, the Valley Games reprint of this title is a graphic design train wreck.  Worse, the poor design is frequently an impediment to gameplay.  To wit: a lot of the game is driven by opinion cards, of which there are seven basic types.  There are always around 30-40 of these cards in view at any time, and each player will want to refer to a large portion of them several times per turn.  The only thing distinguishing the cards is the image on them.  Two of these images are so similar that we are literally considering marking one set up with Sharpies or something to make it easier to tell them apart.  To add insult to injury, the images are amateurish 3D renderings that are so uninteresting that they basically all blend together.

Physical component quality is quite good and Valley Games should be applauded for its great work in this regard.

Update 5/7/08: I've finally gotten my hands on a copy of the HiG edition. Night and day. I'm not wild about the 3D art on the opinion and shadow cabinet cards (though it's far superior to Valley's work), but my criticisms end there. HiG's art perfectly captures the spirit of this game, equal parts austere and comical, deadpan and tongue-in-cheek. One look at the KOALITION tile with its fantastic telephone icon, and everyone knows exactly what kind of game they're playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Only one game played with three players short game Valley edition, which I suspect is not a sweet spot for the game.

For a game that takes so long, there are too many wild swings.  If the change of a media ownership can change a card which influence someones handshake level by  2, and someone elses by -2, that's a potential swing of 40 votes between two players.  The opinion polls are precisely the same.  Coalitions seem designed to screw over players, and there is a significant undercurrent in the game to play negatively rather than positively, which would always leave someone around the table with a sour taste in their mouth.

If it wasn't so long, this would be OK, but if I am playing a game of this length, I really want it to be a lot less swingy, and more palatable for everyone around the table.

Brilliant. Again, lots of fun with the right people - geeky. Recommend some house rules to force people to stick to 2 or 3 core policy positions throughout the game. Doesn't make sense for the Greens to flip from pro green energy to anti, several times during an election, just to secure some votes...

RATING: 10
Own both a 1st Edition (Blue Box, 4 players only) and a Second Edition (Max 5, different rules, Yellow Box)

1st Edition
(Corrected games log: 2 plays, 03-08-07, 08-16-07)
The 1st edition of Macher is noticeably more of a rough-cut than the 2nd, but the game system is still recognizable, and the final product is still very fun. Everything that one would expect from the later version is here in spades: media control, shadow cabinet play, but the system is slightly less tuned and more opaque in many phases, particularly the conversion of meeting markers into votes, and the extremely convoluted final scoring.

I like playing this version of the game rather than the 2nd when we only have 4 players, mainly because the 1st seems to be slightly nastier and more effectively tuned for the 4 scale.

A rule that I particularly like is the way the party platform changes, here it is a completely deterministic, voluntary choice thing, and I would actually like to convert that rule to the 2nd edition, because I think it adds another interesting player choice into the mix without sacrificing anything in the process.

I will say though, the final scoring is a headache your first time through, and the scores seem positively gaudy when one is used to the later iteration of the system.


2nd Edition

Masterful, deep, intriguing, there is nothing I can say negative about this game other than the fact that due to its political nature the scale should be a minimum 4. The 4 hours this takes feel like less than 1 to me, as it pulls me in completely. Hard to find a game with a more long term strategy element to it either, this will reward the person thinking 3 elections ahead time and time again with a big fat mandate and the score to show for it. The balance on this game is utterly superb as well, early election victories lead to more points for media markers, yet lower the number of national issues you're going to successfully dictate. Small elections might offer a small mandate, but they might be an easy way to push your agenda, or get your media on top. Control the media? Your agenda becomes the people's agenda. Cash in early chips and go for an absolute majority to further your own ends? Or hold out and try to push that multiplier a little bit higher? Absolutely everything I'm looking for in a game...

Scale is by far and away best with 5, though I am willing to play it with 4. With 3, the game just loses too much to be worth pulling out.

On an aside, I prefer to play this with the following variants:
- Money can change hands
- Flood Rule
- Shifting National Opinion Rule

Notes on the 3rd Edition (Valley Games):

A minus for the graphical design on the cards, a plus for the graphical design on the boards. Some of the issue cards are too similar for their own good, and are harder to tell apart at a distance than the HiG edition. On the plus, the icons for where the region card / shadow cabinet cards / coalition tiles should go is a nice add.

The rules changes are brutal though:
I played this once with the exchange pool rules as written (i.e.: pool starts at 6, no way to actually add cards to it, it just stays at 6 with cards rotating in and out based on media control) and didn't care for the restriction that it placed on the media. I would lobby actively against playing with the rule again and would likely opt out of playing it if a majority wanted to play with it. 

The short game rules are an atrocity and I would not be willing to play the game with them. They cut off a chunk of the game's long term planning and excise, perhaps, 1-1.5 hours at most from play, a tiny time savings for the kind of things they remove.

There will probably never be a better game of politics ever made.  I love this game.  I gripe about how influential the polls are in the game - they can really spoil it sometimes - but I still love it.  For years, this was the only game I thought of when thinking of playing a game on my birthday.

Update: I think I'm done with this. It was a landmark game to be sure, with many stages within a round, and looking forward up to 3 rounds ahead. But every round seems too samey. It could be three rounds or thirty. And the randomness from the dice and cards is a bit too much. At least for a game this long. The "let's play fast" aspirations are not enough.

---

If you take the time to really understand the rules, it really flows quite nicely and isn't that complicated. It's just so hard to find the time to play. Update: I played twice in the last week. I will probably never do that again in my life. But boy was it great. The first game was a teaching game where I taught it to three new players and came in dead last (what???). Then a few days later the same group played again (shaving a full hour+ off the play time), and I redeamed myself, winning 348 to 346 (and down from there). Incredible game. SO many ways to influence the game system. So many ways to critically foul things up. :-)

RATING: 4
Die Macher never struck me as a title I should be pursuing, and with the experience of a 2-round session (mutilating the long-term planning) by two players (eviscarating the coalition aspect) I really have no right to be judging this game, let alone discuss it the way I am doing now. 

The game left a lasting impression of being needlessly complex on me. It derives a semblance of depth from the fact that it is nearly impossible to predict what will be happening a few turns from the current one, let alone how you should plan for the occasion. If the various ways in which cards are used, re-used, re-branded, shifted, and media'd away between various positions on different boards isn't sufficient to convince you of that, then the fact that the score reaches large triple digit numbers, made up from six or seven distinct sources which more or less weigh in equally heavy in the total, surely will. There is no way to accurately guesstimate the effect of winning an election now versus holding out on one four turns later. Die Macher is therefore very close to its subject matter: politics [i]is[/i] a weird mixture of intuition, timing, and sometimes even knowledge.

Now it isn't really fair to be comparing a game from 1986 to the standards of 2009, the time I played it. Games were very different back then: those were the days of Avalon Hill and wargames, so players were used to longer playing times and more detailed representations of a chosen subject. But still, that was 1986. Basically, I feel people should not go out of their way to try this mastodont. Chances are fairly large that if your interests run towards longer and more involved titles you'll already have played it, and if they don't then you lose little by passing over it. Don't be fooled by the lure of 'elegant' or 'clean' mechanisms: they aren't. Well, individually, they are. But there are [i]so many[/i] the effect is rather lost. If you like playing by gut feeling, and can stomach a good bit of cajoling, luring and dealmaking, and don't mind the long playing time, perhaps it's good fare. If you don't, search out modern titles. For me, the single trial run was more than enough to know that I won't be needing to try this game again.

[b]Update[/b] Looking back at my own comment I'm going to have to retract some of it. The future planning is still annoying in a game of this length, but it's less bad than in my recollection. You can, through careful manipulation of the game's mechanisms, alter the public opinion of future states in your own favour; but the question is then whether you have enough steam left to protect yourself against the inevitable backlash from opponents who alter your popularity to something which sucks harder than a black hole. Prematurely cashing in on meeting markers is key here, which is a mechanism which I obviously couldn't have tested in full in my first attempt.

Coalitions are nice, but hard to play for, and even harder to abuse by timely manipulation of media markers. I struck a lucky coincidence in which I could force a coalition on a strong partner [i]after[/i] replacing her only media marker in the state with one of my own... and since the marker area was full at that point she couldn't retaliate. This is in all likelihood advanced Macher-trickery.

That all said, the amount of randomness in this game is inexcusable for the length it takes to play. The party cards change only slowly; and the public opinion is chosen with little regard to sense or common values of the federal union. Yes, the game is about manipulating both, but it achieves this through contrived detours. And a player who is lucky to have a good overlap straight from the start will have his hands free to manipulate matters elsewhere. Opinion polls are a big money sink and can be a godsend or a total waste; and the effect they have is... well, random. The increase and decrease of party membership can equally well be a godsend or a total waste. Die Macher slowly turns into a [i]long[/i] plodding game of randomness management, with little room for clever interactive play apart from kicking each other's shins en route. Perhaps then a game of Massilia or Vanuatu is then more appropriate: played in a third of the time it takes to finish Die Macher both titles take a simple core and [i]keep[/i] it simple while introducing plenty of shinkicking.

The other problem I had, adding points with a large dynamic range together, remains as-is. It makes matters very hard to determine whether or not to go for a particular state or not. The fact that the same issue is still very much alive in a game like Russian Railroads which appeared 27 or 28 years after Die Macher (!!) illustrates that people apparently like this sort of thing. 'You cannot know who is winning!', or something similar. Why is that a Good Thing in a game lasting for 3 to 4 hours? Is uncertainty in who will win the only thing that keeps players going through this non-neglegible timeframe? That's rather patronising, innit?

Finally, the artwork in the VG edition is lousy for gameplay, because it is difficult to see what others have lying in front of them. Also annoying is the large amount of rules issues which were introduced into the 3rd Edition. Kevin Nesbitt at one point assured everyone that utmost care had gone into recasting the rules, with the best interests of the game at heart... Shame he didn't really bother closing all these annoying loopholes. Official answers are not really forthcoming unless you go back to the 2nd Edition rules Valley Games rejected in the first place. *Duh!* Fortunately VG are dead in the water so this sort of crap is no longer unleashed upon the unsuspecting player.

In any case, my end conclusion is that Die Macher remains overly long and overly overwrought. It was nice to have played several full games at very long last, but it was not an experience which had me interested for much more. I've increased the rate somewhat, but that's where it's going to stay.

I was skeptical of this game. I had played a few four hour games in the past and they were not pleasant (diplomacy as an example). I learn more each time I play. The game has several different methods to score points. The only down side to the game is the length of instruction. Time passes quickly as you play.

This will probably be a 10 when I get a full game in.  Wow.  It is better than advertised.  So much going on.  Two small quibbles, the order that you do things (counter-clockwise/clockwise) is a bit confusing and it wasn't on our cheat sheet.  I can't hold it against the player guide or the game, but it is something worth remembering.  I also think that the game could use an example round for teaching new players.  I need to check out the video made for this (Scott's?)

After 2.5 games, this game is really, really good.  Lost the last game by 5 points, and looking back there were so many things I could have done differently to made them up.  I like that.  Here is a game where you can pursue your own course of action and try things out.  The only reason I don't rate this higher, is that in between plays I don't feel the call that other games have on me.  When I am playing it is a great game though.

Wow, just wow.  What an awesome Euro!  The games feels like a 10 for me, but since I've only played it twice, I don't want to go overboard.  So I'll start with an 8.  Played this my first time at Fire & Ice Con in 2008. 

Love the longer term planning involved in the game.  This is an Epic Euro!  

This game has a lot of mechanics that are easy to learn by the first or second round.  However, it took me the whole game to start to see the strategy involved.  I lost miserably both times playing this, but am more than willing to go at this again and again.

My first game with four players (two new) took us four hours.  Seems like that is about how long a 5 experienced players would take so I'm more than willing to go at this again. 

Wish there where more people that I know that like this one as much as I do.  Seems like I'll only get this one played at conventions.

Definitely a keeper. I played my first game yesterday and I won by a margin of 1 point! I still have to figure out the different strategies that will lead to victory. Will be able to evaluate further after more playing, but I definitely want to play again as soon as possible. I think I got hooked!

Update: After having it played 3 times, I upped this game from 8 to 10. It is simply excellent.

THE game, I always wanted. It has one of the most complicated mechanisms, at least among euros. Still it works! and works beautifully. It's like Republic of Rome in some sense. It has the same depth, tension and level of player interaction. Yet it's much more controllable and avoids unpredictable luck. Sophisticated, elegant and deep.

A rich and elegant game mechanic that keeps you captivated to the end.  I am so happy I own Die Macher and I am even happier when I can convince four other players to try it out, even after I tell them it is a game about German politics.  But once introduced to it, every new player has always been quite fond of it as well.

RATING: 6
Reminds me of El grande, In that It's a game that encourages extreme AP, but still has swings of luck that can make the best decisions meaningless.

I can see why this was a great game in 86, but for the time and player count required there are so many better options around today.

Edit: Probably need to give this another go, my first playthrough was hamstrung by deciding to stop competing when It was clear I wasn't going to win the first election, not realising it was still worth going all out for seats as it was the 80 seat state, which put me well being the curve and soured the rest of my game.

Simply a superb game.  Long, but incredibly engrossing.  The Poll Cards are a small blemish on an otherwise almost flawless design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The rules were explained the previous night and I'd borrowed the rulebook - picking up a few mistakes or ommisions on Ian's part.

I fared well in the first few elections but by the 5th was in 2nd last place in total seats so far.

The game ended with me screwing Ian - maybe taking him from 1st to 3rd (me in 2nd) much to his annoyance.

I felt the game was far more enjoyable because I had been already taught the rules and I was able to come into the game with some idea of strategies - namely what I select and holding back my cabinet for a rush in the end.

2 auctions for the last 2 poll results both ended disastrously - 2 other players having a few more units than my 134k ensuring I got neither. Luckily, I wasn't able to be screwed on either place and got 2nd.

There's a definite element of luck - in the dice, in the hidden information of the public opinion (or the public opinion itself) and in the polls - but it never feels absurdly swingy and the game seems to be about managing the chaos as well as you can.

The progressively fewer revealed cards for future elections makes for an elegant demonstration of how we know less about the more distant future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I hesitate to give this game a low rating as I can see why people enjoy it, but this game just isn't for me.  It feels like it wants you to put a lot of thought into your strategy but the high randomness of all the cards and die rolls makes it too frustrating to plan ahead much.

Also, have to say the art on the Valley Games reprint is atrocious.  The topic cards are not only hard to distinguish from a distance but the icons on the bottom aren't even consistent.  A reprint would go a long ways to making this more playable.

RATING: 7
One of the original complex European games. I enjoy this quite a bit, but there are problems. First, the game takes 4 hours plus to play, meaning it gets to the table rarely. Second, it is an odd set of rules, difficult to remember and hard to grasp by newbies. This means that every game is a learning game.  It's nearly impossible to tell who is winning during the game, a good thing as far as I am concerned. But the negatives (including the subject matter...difficult to get people excited to play!) make it unlikely I will play it anytime soon. Too bad.

The King Shit Pooba of German Gaming.  It's long and seemingly complex, but it's not really that bad once you get the gist of an election in a region.  I still have a sore-spot for those poll cards and I'd love to hear from someone who's playtested a nice variant for 'em.  As money's worth reduces in the end-game, the randomly pulled poll cards can be uber powerful...

Un come cocos gigante !! Buen juego, pero necesita algunos cambios para hacerlo más ágil, unos colores para diferenciar las cartas le vendrían muy bien. La mecánica es genial !
Tras la segunda partida mi impresión sobre el juego mejora, pero no lo suficiente como para cambiarle la nota. No me negaría a jugarlo cada cierto tiempo, y de hecho reconozco que se trata de un jueguito muy bien hecho. Esta partida la jugué en un ambiente mucho mejor para la comida de coco que supone una partida al DM, razón por la que acabé entendiendo mucho mejor todos los detalles y mecánicas del juego, pero el problema de los símbolos que se usan para las cartas persiste, este juego necesita un rediseño con códigos de colores para los temas de las cartas, es abrumador mirar las cartas de cada jugador, las del estado que se está jugando y las de la opinión general ... con un código de colores este juego ganaría muchísimo.

RATING: 8
Heavy Euro.  Hard to believe this game was published in 1986. I imagine it will be considered a classic, as it is that good! Theme fits well with the mechanics.  Drawback is the length and learning curve.  Almost no downtime for any player--engaging throughout.  So many strategies and ways to victory.  Fun, exciting game!
Unfortunately, it won't get played as often because of the barrier to introduce it based off of the theme and length.

I have a niftly flip-book (printed off from a great file here on BGG) of the various phases which helps the game run along quite smoothly.

Looking to trade for the German 2nd edition.

RATING: 8
Yep, this is definitely one of the longer and more complex euros I've ever played. On the whole the game is good. There's a lot of interaction between different elements, and there's a minor bit of chaos to keep things from becoming predictable. I do worry about the significance of the final election, which can cause huge swings in the national party VP's.

There are a couple rules oddities and production issues. Why are there two types of positions for each issue if they're the same in practice? Why do coalition members get to undo their partner's federal stance? But, these are minor annoyances.

In the future I would only play the short game if any of the players were newbies. Playing with people who have played it just once before drastically reduced our playing time.

Preliminary rating after one play. It IS as good as everyone says! A classic game of earning money and points using many different mechanisms that all interact in interesting ways. There does seem to be many paths to victory and its a bit more subtle that just earning influence in a few areas. Its also quite satirically funny! Playing time's not too bad either with the right crowd (4 hours?).

One of the truly great German board games: a multi-faceted game of elections and political party competition. Great interlocking systems where one decision has ramifications for all the others.

Very unique concept and well executed; it does have the feel of a real election.  I really like this game, despite the fact that artwork is kinda terrible.  Art doesn't usually bother me, except that in this game, the cards are not only ugly, but somewhat ambiguous at times - several cards have nearly identical images on them (Valley Games edition).

Anyway, if you have any interest in politics, this is worth trying out.

RATING: 8
Great game.  Really have to work many different mechanics to accomplish such a simple goal.  Match your party's platform with the public platform is the object...but how can you achieve this using minimal resources?  I can easily see this game being bumped up to a 9 with repeat plays.  I'm holding back because I'm just a bit worried that players tend to gravitate towards the same issues.  In the 1st edition I think this was the case and each election had pretty much the same issues (with one person getting locked out each time). However, with a 5th player revised rules (max of 6 cards in exchange pool), this could be a complete non-issue.  This needs to get played more often.

Update:  After 5 or so plays, I think I'll leave it at 8. It's a great game, but you have to draw the right issues at the right time.  Or you have to hope to get in coalitions.  If you focus on a region only to get left out of a coalition, it can really hurt your position.  Let it happen more than once, and it's probably irrecoverable. I don't have issues w/this in diplomatic games.  But this one feels a little  euro-ish to break out the Diplomacy hat and start wheelin and dealin.

RATING: 6
I was very, very interested in Die Macher. I love politics, I studied German politics a bit in college, and it was a heavier euro, which is generally my preferred type of game. 

Unfortunately, I was terribly, terribly disappointed. The game itself was a bit of a slog. I don't really mind long games (unless they start hitting the 9 hour mark) but the interlocking mechanisms seemed to be less interesting and thematic then they could have been. I am not normally a theme nazi, but I would prefer a bit of a stronger one on a game as long as this. In addition there seemed to be really no way to catch up once you were behind. Assuming competent play by the people on the lead, if you make a mistake in which elections to invest in during the beginning of the game you are going to be behind for the rest of the game. Our relative positions after the second election, were identical at the end of the game. In the end, I was rather disappoint with it. I would be willing to play it again, just to see if I can confirm my opinions, but on the whole? Thumbs down.

RATING: 9
Stunning game themed on German elections.  Each player plays a political party and must guide their way through a series of seven elections.  Simple mechanics interact in complex ways, as players juggle party meetings, media, cash all in the quest for votes.  The result is wonderful.  Easily in my top five games of all time.  It will take four hours, but will seem like only two hours.  November 2006 - just played a friend's Valley Games edition - muddy and confusing graphics on the cards (two of the issues look identical from outside a foot away), however the game plays almost the same (a few odd rules differences).  Hans im Glueck/Moskito edition is much cleaner and easier on the eyes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Lots of interesting things going on in this game, but it's just too long (5-6 hours in our group) and too random (opinion cards in your initial deal and in the regions, opinion polls that you're bidding for blindly, and enough die rolling to hurt if you roll badly but not enough to average out the luck), with way too much "take that" along the way (opinion polls and shadow cabinets).  And since it's so hard to evaluate all the wealth of information, you may be mistakenly thought of as leading, and whacked with negative opinion polls, letting the real leader stay on top.  So it's more about whining and diplomacy than anything else.  I'd like to try it once with the opinion polls face-up, so you can see what you're bidding for, but I have a feeling it won't help enough for me to really enjoy it.  Tyranno Ex (same designer) has many similar mechanisms (despite the completely different theme!), is an hour or two shorter, and has a more up-front luck factor (and fits the theme better) that doesn't bother me nearly as much.

[Schmiel] Tentative rating after a learning game: Isn't *really* as long or as fussy as everyone makes it out to be. Please, it's no Civ! It seems like it has enough rounds to permit plenty of long-term strategy, which is a big plus for me. I was also surprised to find that several of my favorite games are really just boiled-down portions of Die Macher! A seminal design indeed!

I like the theme, that every rule try to act some behaviour from real life. You can feal like a real political leader. That is great.

But...
Game is not so quick, it could take ~3h. Unfortunatelly after all that time you can't win without more luck than your opponents. I expect from long games, that gives me more control of my final result.

Still, there is something in this game, that i probably will play it again. (And  complain again perhaps.)

Recently purchased during the Le Valet's boxing day sale. Never played. Heard lots about this game.

Played once so far. I was quite impress by the depth of the game in question. Lots of decision taking. Some decisions are short term, why others could pay off more in the end game.

When we played, we were 4 players and we were all newbies at this game. So we took it slow and did step by step in trying in figure out what we were doing and why and what are the pros and cons of each decision.

It's something you need to play 2-3 times in a short period of time to fully understand this game. It's a gamers game with lots of meat.

Never thought that politics could be this much fun.

Got another copy of the game in shrinkwrap for trade at the Le Valet`s summer garage sale.

How to describe "Die Macher" to the uninitiated? Well, imagine a game that makes even non-Germans develop a keen interest in the otherwise extremely boring German election system - people who hate statistics and percentages suddenly strive for parties they have never heard of in their life. The game is a realistic simulation on one hand, a superb puzzle for gamer geeks on the other hand. Although completely abstract it is a totally engrossing, if not a little abstract game. Let the "spin doctors" (a rough English translation of "Macher") rule forever!

Filled with interesting strategy decisions.  Every action has opportunity costs.  Money is tight, but taking corporate donations loses party membership.  Party platform that gets votes in Rheinland-Pfalz may be worse than useless in Niedersachsen.  If you use the Finanz-Minister to buy votes, you can't also use him to improve voter perception of your Party.  If you take control of the media for a big State's election far in advance, you can't use those media cubes to influence public opinion in the current State's election.  The choices just go on and on.  As a bonus, who doesn't love being pro-nuclear or anti-genetic engineering, all in German?

THIS IS THE GAME! just perfect!

RATING: 8
Players are trying to maximize their party's political control in Germany. Elections are held in 7 regions. Each region resolves itself over 4 turns and is offset from the previous region by 1 turn. Regions are scored partly based on each party's popularity there. Popularity is a dynamic graph similar to a stock chart. Players attempt to cash in their "meetings" when the graph is high so as to score as many votes as possible. This is complicated by the fact that players can change their party's stand on the issues each turn, and by the fact that the stance of a region on the issues is only revealed one new issue per turn.

So you need to find a balance between your party's issues and the 7 constantly (but slowly) changing regional issue sets. If you max out the current region which is about the hold the election, then you may have almost no sway at all in the next one. But maybe it's worth it. Winning an election gives you a big boost on the national charts, and let's you sway opinions...

I'm torn on this one. Die Macher is thematic, reasonably easy to play, and an overall rich experience. Its con is its huge length-to-decision ratio. For any worthwile decision you are looking at a lot of downtime. I know I am really sensitive to the length/time ratio, and I really felt it in Die Macher. Bottom line is that Die Macher is a game that eveyone who is investied in the gaming hobby should try at least once, even if you are a duration sissy such as myself. 

My rating reflects the fact that I could easily sit down and enjoy my experience on a very infrequent ratio.

Hands down, my Favorite game.  Has a two turn learning curve.  The first two games I played I lost horribly.  Went out and purchased immeadiately after 2nd game.

I have played this so often, that I cannot even remeber the last time I used an original scorecard.  There are some differences between second and third editions.  My ranking is based upon second edition rules.

RATING: 9
Probably the best election game I've played. Runs the player through the gamut of what most political parties have to do to win elections. Complex but not obtusely so (although the rulebook could be better organised). At five hours, it's probably still manageable but considering that you're going to be going through the same steps for each election anyway, I recommend going for the shorter game variant in the Valley Games version to keep the monotony down.

RATING: 6
[2, or really 1 1/2 plays] Finally got to play this, and it's pretty cool, but way complicated.  Definitely had the problems with not thinking quite enough steps ahead, and planning stuff that turned out to be against the rules just because there were so many rule details I couldn't remember them all.  I would need a few more plays of this just to start to play competently, but it might be worth doing.

RATING: 9
Great, great, great.  I'm inclined to agree with those who say this game is actually much lighter than its reputation.  So then, how can it justify it's length?  With theme.  Theme is what encourages length, and this game feels right at every moment and absorbs you in.  Frankly, a long game full of brain-crushing decisions is beyond the means of most anyway, except for the hardiest of the 18xx crowd.

This is a game with an awesome scope, such that is missing from most contemporary game design.  So many different mechanisms live inside this box, and they've been arranged together in a really cohesive way.  If you're not playing this game with threats, cajoling, pleading, and angry recrimination, I suspect you are doing it wrong.

Beautiful, original graphic design too, assuming you have the HiG version - WHICH I DO.

Die Macher left me unimpressed, however, in the game's defense, we apparently played something wrong whereby people had way, way, way more options to swap cards in and out than they should've. I found the game tedious with how much matching it asked you to do by setting yourself up a turn ahead only to have one or more people just swap out cards you wanted. It felt dumb to spend 3-4 hours constantly rebuilding my sandcastle and have others tear it down with ease. I lost by a mere 6 points though.

I'm wasn't enthralled by the procedural turn structure of the game which, like most procedural games, kept the game plodding along instead of taking off. [i]We do this. OK, that’s over. Now we do this. OK, that’s over. Now we…[/i] There just isn't enough there for me to understand the game's reputation. It's a set matching game with both the game board and other players. 

I wasn't clear on what the ostensible fun of the game is -- the alliances? They seemed rather obvious. I can’t see the justification for the length of explanation vs interesting decisions. Despite our rules infraction, my gut says I don't need to revisit this one.

Eddie's Comments: Rating is based on one game; however, i came to this rating AFTER the rules explanation (which took about 1.5 hours) and before playing the game. Playing the actual game only finalized my rating. There is alot going on but if you have the right people playing (which I did) it is a very enjoyable experience.

A classic and engaging game in which all the parts work together to make an amazing whole.  I regret that it's so hard to organize a game of Die Macher.

After my first game in a long while (14/1/07) then some concern about money in the game, and thus giving it the score 7.25.

Aside from game length issues, then my score ought to be higher I feel.

This is one of the Boyfriends grail games.

Enjoyed the play of this and it is really quite different to anything else in my collection. It's not as amazing as the current price tag would seem to suggest but it is quite good.

We only played the short game (5turns) but still played for a good 5 or so hours, but it was a learning game for all of us. None of us were really thinking about strategy rather just doing stuff and seeing what effect it would actually have. 
Overall I would be happy to play again.

Heavy game and you have to get in the sequence/rhythm, otherwise you might struggle for cash. *** played again after several years, it's a heavy game! Long, more of a sim than a game. There's not much politics really, much more on the placing of meetings and controling media. It's interesting to see how much publishing or supressing an opinion poll matters. It can really damage your opponents, unless they control the media, in which case they cannot suffer a negative affect! How true! I'll play this again, but I'm not desperate.

Four of us played the longer 5 hour version.  Not sure what the hype is about.  Too long a game for such repetition.  So many calculations that it is difficult to really know how you are doing unless obviously way behind.  I failed to get enough money in the first round and was behind for the remainder of the game.  I was always outbid which simply produced more money for those who won the bid. 5 hours is a long time to play and win only one bid.  
  What was Valley Games thinking when they made the graphics on the Public Opinion and Party Platform cards so similar for Global Terrorism, Nuclear Power, and Economic Redevelopment?  All of us were picking up the Public Opinion cards to get a better look to see which of the three policies it was--how irritating.  
     I am sure I will have to suffer through this again, but all of us agree that it will be the shorter version.

A "Holy Grail" of a game.  I can't imagine ever feeling I've cracked this one, it's not the complexity that makes this unsurmountable, it's the staggering options which open up each turn.  Remarkable on so many levels that I'm forced to reconsider if my other 10's are really up to this monumental achievement.  Wow for so many reasons, but mostly for making me feel I'm not worthy to play this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Overall this is a decent game of political party management/electioneering.  I thought everything worked together pretty well.  The theme, however, is really dry.

One thing that I noticed is that I could make a 180 on my party platform, but that had no impact on my party members, when in real life it probably would.  You also have to realize that you need to be playing one or two rounds ahead to make sure you keep party cards that will benefit you, or take a slight hit this round to set yourself up for the next.

The dice are the biggest part of luck here.  Drawing poor party cards doesn't bother me that much, and doing an auction of a blind poll before it comes out is thematic, even if you wind up spending a bunch of money on something that doesn't help you that much.

I'm glad I at least played this once, and while I would play it again, I don't feel a need to request it.

I find the polls to be too powerful and random for the length of the game.  Everyone knows they're powerful, so you can't win them all.  Your ability to swap issues can be too restrictive as well.  The interesting part of the game is how the players interact and both of these issues just detract from the core of the game.

RATING: 9
[Planning, Resource Management, Negotiation, Bidding, Political] [4P:9, 5P:9] *** Preliminary rating. Definite '10' potential, but it'll take a while and certainly a few more plays. Favorable comparisons from my gaming buddies to PR and PoF, from both a mechanism and stylistic standpoint. I have a better one. Macher's nature and rhythm, among all the games I've played, is closest to Kramer & Kiesling's Maharaja. You're planning and executing 4 elections simultaneously, and trying your darndest to insulate yourself from the inherent chaos of the game system while keeping your timing and resources as straight as possible. You're trying to make sure that you get close to your desired result in every region that matters, whether or not someone whacks you with a bad opinion poll when that region becomes current. (Or outright insulating yourself with media control, which is expensive to set up, but even more expensive for your opponents to undo when they choose to.) I would equate this to being able to do what you plan to do in Maharaja regardless of what hijinks people pull with your character card and the governor track. What Macher has over Maharaja is many, many more paths to victory at the cost of a significantly higher fiddle factor. However, given the theme the whole thing works, and in a surprisingly elegant manner despite all the moving parts. 
 
In short, I (or should I say we) like it a lot, and I can see us polishing off a full game in 3-4 hours once we have the whole thing down and can take turns rapidly a-la Goa at full throttle. Clearly an "only game of the night" situation, but that was how it was when we first started playing 5P PR years ago (we were averaging 3.5 hours a game early on, and we still take 2.5 hours today).
 
The only trouble we had rules-wise was with the exchange pool. Playing it with Schmeil's "flood the pool" rules was rather counterintuitive, but in the end I guess it follows theme-wise since issues do get more muddled as elections get close to climax. 

*** #1 Most Wanted Game. Rabidly recommended by my Geekbuddies - 8.39(!) rating, 18 ratings, rated only behind Puerto Rico, The Princes of Florence and Euphrat & Tigris. Now that's a foolproof recommendation.

An impressive game, but ultimately rather tedious. Part of the problem is that winning the last round is so important.

If you're going to play, definitely download some player aids such as the "summary-1-3a.pdf" series to help you keep track of what happens during each phase and of the variations in the mechanisms used, such as when each type of auction ends and whether someone who passes is allowed to bid again later during the same auction.

Very original, highly interactive, and quite balanced given the number of intertwined mechanics. The game is not that difficult to play, dont be afraid by the size of the rulebook.

I can see the selling points, but:
1) While not *horribly* long, it is longer than I like them, and it's very much a lather-rinse-repeat kind of game.
2) The polls and their ridiculous randomness. For all its fiddly rules, Die Macher is very much a German game, which makes a mechanic that would be more a home in AH's Kingmaker all the more distracting.

A lot of variation and ambiguity of rules between the different editions, which leads to a lot of "play however your group likes" as interpretations.

Who would have thought that a political marathon of 5 hours could be fun? Die Macher allows you to enter the policital arena and wrestle with the lions so to speak. Schemeing, money from dubious sources, spin doctors, media manipulation; you name it, the game has it. And even though the game consists of seven identical elections (procedurally, that is; some are certainly more important than others) it never feels repetitive. As the political opinion develops gradually and can be influenced already well in advance to the actual vote forward planning is not only possible but quite crucial since you cannot simply turn your party platform around by 180 degress from one ballot to the next.

Ways to generate points exist aplenty, and sometimes the junior partner in a coalition is the real winner. There are ways to force unsuspecting victims into a coalition, and the ever-important last minute polls can cause huge swings in one direction or another so you better make sure they turn out in your favour. 

Sometimes the amount of luck especially due to the polls feels like it might be a bit too much for a game this long, but it does even out somewhat over the course of the game, and you normally get benefits from any commissioned polls even if they aren't quite what you were hoping for. Even if it seems you're out after a particularly bad round you can normally claw your way back because everyone else is more intent on harrassing the current (perceived) leader and would rather team up with you than anyone else. I'm not sure how often Die Macher can hit the table because of both theme and length. I'm very sure I'll try to be there when it does, though.

Tough call this. As I know it will be blasphemous for some eyes to read, but I just couldn't understand why the world is in love with this game.  It is repetative, heavy on screwage, and heavily luck driven.  I know a lot of people will argue that luck levels itself out.  But two people experienced (at seperate times) four rounds of being unable to set up their platforms to work with the current or future opinions because of poor card draws.  Also money seems useless, except for bidding up the trend card.  Which in it's own right is totally luck based.  I would say 90% of the time someone spent a small fortune for nothing - 3 national party points. the length of the game, and commitment to play makes the luck in this too devastating. Keep in mind this is said from someone that likes both luck and scewage in games.

A fun, if involved 6 hour marathon of a game where you compete to win elections in different states of Germany.  You pay for local marketing and rally the base, build local organizations and grow you support to win the national election.  Your party line changes and so does the opinion of the masses.  I fun game with lots of strategy and some luck, lots of things going on to think about but very good.

OK... I understand now. I'm not sure I'll play it more than 4 or 5 more times in my lifetime, but I get why people love this game so dang much.

Board Games With Scott does an amazing job explaining the rules - it is ESSENTIAL viewing before you play.

This is daunting to teach to new players, and we only ever have time for the short game. But even with only 3 players the game is very strategic and very fulfilling.
The game reminds me of Tigris and Euphrates, in that I am often at a loss for which of my many strategic options to make use of. This makes the game very deep, but also a little too complex and frustrating at times.

This is a great game, lots of fun with some real negotiation.  The simultaneous planning of the next 3 or 4 elections w/more and more information as time goes on is my favorite twist in the game.  It is a real juggling act.

It's got a throw as many things to do at the same time vibe too, which is both fun but can be a bit trying and gimmicky.  It's also a bit too long.  Overall, though, this comes highly recommended.  

I used to give it a 10, but that was because I mostly only played eurogames and was measuring them against my limited euro experience.  Once I started to move into AT and wargames, I realized that eurogames are just plain not my thing.  This game is about as good and thematic as a euro gets to me, however.  Euros don't get much better than this.

After playing Die Macher one time I would say that it is a very very good game for the 1980s.  That said the game is a bit dated for the 2000s.  It has a quite a range of options to the game and is mostly skill based.  The problem with Die Macher is that it has two luck dependent items (party platform cards and polling) that can greatly swing a game which otherwise is predominantly skill based.  If Die Macher wasn't a 4+ hour game the luck element wouldn't be a big issue because the rest of the game is so strong but when investing 4+ hours of time in a game it is discouraging to think that the luck of card draws can prevent you from winning (not prevent you from being competitive mind you but realistically the luck of the draw may prevent you from having a fair shot at winning the game.).

[b]Die Macher[/b] [i]Karl Heinz Smichael 1986[/i]
A fantastic game, the best political game ever created and not as complex as people use to think. You can really play ahead and have a strategy in this wonderful design that despite its age it is still as fresh as any novelty, in fact its mechanics are more innovative than most of the new games published in the last years. It is a crying shame that the three editions are so ugly because this gem deserves better looks. I apply four special rules: a) in the last election you are allowed to promote only one card to the national board in order to reduce the impact of this very last election; b) bidding affects all the positions in the turn order not just one; c) you can socre +50 votes; and d) there are some restrictions to the change of political ideas phase. A fantastic euro that you must reall try at least once.

1 play.  4 hours.  4 players. Great game. Thoroughly engrossing. Very Little downtime as each players moves are very pivotal to your own struggle.  Want to play again. soon.  &nbsp  2nd play lasted about 3.5 hours with the same 4 players but about 8 months later.  First election refamiliarised ourselves with the mechanics and it was no holds bar from then on in.  Excellent game and time flies by - it is very heavy.   Player interaction is constant, and everyone's decisions affect your position.  Increasing rating to 8 (Dec 07).

Finally managed to play this game a last. Some things seemed weird: the randomness of the dice, the zero value of money at the end of the game, the fact that each election doesn't have a winner (PR I guess?).  But still it is a huge and deep design, that necessarily has a very steep learning curve. Ultimately, I'm in favour, but with some reservations.

RATING: 5
My biggest disappointment in some time, perhaps because my expectations were so high. The first couple turns provided everything friends had recommended Die Macher for: a deep game with lots of strategic options and many apparent paths to victory. 

However, in the mid- to late-game money flows freely, and the options degenerate to throwing the max the game allows at the media, meetings, and shadow cabinets, etc., then dumping every dollar you have left on random polls that may not help you, but - because your other options for mitigating the damage are restricted by seemingly arbitrary limits - 20% of the time the polls are too catastrophic not to spend every dollar available to keep them away from your opponents. I like games that involve tactical choices to mitigate potential bad luck, but if there isn't a runaway leader, Die Macher is decided largely by the random draw of the last three poll cards - *far* too much weight on a small number of random events for my taste - /especially/ in a 4 hour game. It's not like we can play several times to let variations in luck average out.

If I play again, I'll insist on a shorter game (I believe five elections is one of the official options) and probably on some house rules to lower the amount of cash available. (In my first game few players took the special interest money more than once or twice, yet we were all drowning in cash, spending >100K on face-down cards that 80% of the time ended up being merely 0-3 points.) Without the cash to max out everything except the auctions I think the game would be more interesting, but the overwhelming power of those random polls may still ruin it. 

I'm told different editions have significantly different rules for determining the availability of the public opinion options media influence can choose. The rules we used made the media too powerful - especially in the late game - and made it foolish not to spend every available dollar (up to the arbitrary cap) on media markers. One player wandering by at the convention suggested that the rule of always having six public opinion options available for the media would be more balanced. I don't know which edition that rule is from, or if it's a house rule, but I agree.

I can appreciate that Die Macher is one of the games that "founded" the Eurogaming hobby, but ignoring the rose-colored glasses of nostalgia, there are SO many other games I'd rather play.

Not a game for the faint of heart.  There are so many things you can do, yet such limited resources.  Do I focus on *this* region, or work on the next region?  Votes, trends, media, party meetings, membership - you can't do it all.  Wonderfully tense.
Better with 4/5 than with 3.

RATING: 9.5
Components: if you have the Moskito edition, they are good
Complex: hard to master, difficult to learn
Weight: Heavy
Players: 5
Length: around 4 hours
Mechanics: bidding, area control...
Decisions: really a lot
Opinion: it is always a pleasure to play a game of Die Macher, although the theme is one to run away from it, the gameplay is delicious.
Master your political party to win the elections... but you have to decide which of the 7 Ländern to go for, keeping an eye on the National board.
I would say that the rules are not hard to learn, but there are so many that make them difficult. Once you start playing, everything is very well connected, and that is make the game much easy to understand.
You would play 6 rounds (the last one is just played after the 6th) for one Länder each one, but you can prepare your future situation. Prepare the politics of your party versus the one of the current Länder, taking care of the National board for game end, decide if you need money from private donations, bid for different surveys (not only for helping you, but also for avoiding they mess your plans) and go for votes on the different elections.
Although the length of the game is around 4 hours, they pass really fast. There is no time between turns, each round has lot of phases, and they go very fast making all players being participating all the time.
I could be talking good things about the game for long time, I would finish just saying that is one of my favorite games, a pleasure to play whenever I have the occasion and would look for plays as soon as I could

RATING: 8
Die Macher is a very good game, although not the nirvana orgasm holy grand poobah of gaming that it's sometimes made out to be.  It was an astonishing game for its time, and still holds up very well.  When I first played, I was shocked at the huge role that luck plays in the opinion polls and (especially) in the regional issues.  That's not what I had expected of a game that's often portrayed as the mother of all German heavyweight games, and is a little disappointing for a game of this length and complexity.  Best with five.

Glad to have finally gotten a play in of this. It did take 4 hours or so. It is fun and lots of interesting choices. You could probably do 4 elections instead of 7 and cut 1.5 hours out of gameplay without seriously hurting your enjoyment of it. It may have even had a short-game option which I think i would take next time.

It was complex enough that we were consulting the player aids on every turn.

One play, five players. With rules explanation, the game took six hours, and I was the only newbie. The individual mechanisms of the game are all simple and easy-to-understand, but there are a ton of them--imagine taking ten small Knizia games and jamming them together into one monster game--and in the end they didn't quite gel together for me. Also, at certain points I felt like the decision tree exploded to the point where the game stopped being fun and turned into plain old work. Maybe I'll enjoy it more on repeat playing, but at the moment I'd much rather play Liberte or Princes of the Renaissance if I'm in the mood for something on the heavier side. Incidentally, having a player aid that listed all the steps of a round would have been a big help.

RATING: 8
A truly excellent game. Don't be intimidated by the length or complexity (even though what you've heard is probably true).

The game simulates multiple elections throughout different territories of Germany. There are five parties that must adjust their policies to match the public opinion, gain voters, and use media influence to win these elections.

I had a revelation while playing recently that instead of one, big, meaty game, it's more like six meaty games being played simultaneously. I think in the future if I ever have the opportunity, that is how I would teach the game. The mechanics for each election are fairly straight-forward; it's just the ability to affect four at a time that complicates things.

Hands down the best German game I have ever played.  So many things going on, unlimited strategy: just brilliant.  Perfect mix of luck and calculation, a real nail bitter.  Cooperation, resource management, biding, back stabbing, this game has it all. Fantastic game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Shockingly fun and enjoyable for such a dull-sounding theme.  After a single play (and with several rules misplayed), I can tell this is my #1 game.  I feel its depth and complexity, the rich and daunting engineering marvel... I could continue in hyperbole, but these words will not aid you.

Pro:  A true gamer's game, requiring thought and forethought.  While it is LONG, the time flies by and never drags.  Shorter version available.

Con:  Opinion polls are very powerful, perhaps too much so; perhaps there is a variant to mitigate this?
May be longer than you like, so plan ahead for this one.  Don't make it the last game of the night.  Complex play mechanics require at least one throw-away game unless playing with veterans.  If you are all new to the game, re-read the rules carefully before AND AFTER playing.  There's a lot going on.

Bottom line:  Long, yes.  Complex, yes.  Is it worth the trouble?  Definitely YES.  With the right group, Die Macher is a game that will become the centerpiece of your game nights.

I had quite a high intial rating for this game.  But after 5 full games, a pattern developed that really turned me off.

Understanding who is in the lead and what actions will result in zero benefit to a player (but screwage to another) apparently escapes about 25-50% of the players of this game.  The result is someone winning that didn't understand how it happened, and a number of back-markers either pissed because they know what happened but couldn't stop it, or thinking they just got unlucky because they didn't understand the consequences of their actions.

The other disturbing element is that once everyone has money (turn 3+), everyone is maxing out their available actions and it comes down to who is rolling better, who has a few more euros for an opinion poll auction, and how those random opinion polls come out.

Theoretically, if you subtracted the bull-in-the-china-shop newbs out of the game and everyone understoood the consequences of various actions, and those same people played without AP to make the game a reasonable length, I could see this being a sublime experience.  So my rating stays a '4' and if this group of experts invites me to a game I will play, but never again with novices.

This is a very good, but very heavy and complex, euro.  It has a lot of interaction and almost no downtime.  I appreciated the design, and I do understand how it is for certain gamers it is an ultimate gaming experience.  Also, despite the long rules, and multiple interlocking systems, once you learn the whole thing it works together pretty well and makes a lot of sense.  

It is a truly great game, but one where its "positives" don't really outweigh the problems.  At the end of the day, if I am going to play a 3+ hour game that requires 3-4 dedicated players who know a complex set of rules, there are a LOT of other things I would rather play than Die Macher.  The graphical design on the cards in the Valley Games edition is also pretty poor.  Several of the icons are nearly identical, to the point where you have to be careful not to misplan a turn based on not paying close enough attention to the icons.  

That being said, the combination of bidding, blind card play, and the way the issue cards and other mechanics all interact together to produce one coherent game is pretty amazing, especially considering how many moving parts are working.

An interesting game, but the luck of the draw can seriously hamper your options.  Even though I seem to be able to draw nothing but policy cards I already had, I still liked the experience.

[I've rated this using the BGG recomended ratings.]

This is NOT a political game in the sense that simulates a political process. It is an abstract pure and simple which is primarily based on an extremely involved area majority mechanic. That mechanic operates on two different but interacting levels: ideally, you want to have the most votes in an area (with the amount of your votes being a function of how many SMALL cubes you have in that area, with there being 7 areas in total) in which you also have the most BIG cubes. The involved nature of the area control mechanic relates primarily as to how the number of SMALL cubes that give rise to votes is calculated, and how it can be changed. There is also an auction aspect to the game, but the game is not really an auction game. Finally, there is actually a set collection aspect to the game which is important to how the SMALL cubes are converted to votes: each player has a set of cards on display, and each area does to, a player can covert there SMALL cubes to an increasing number of votes if the player's cards increasingly match the area's cards. In summary, the game is not really about politics; it's an abstract.

The epic Euro. Much too long to get a very high rating but it's a very nice "event" game. It really gives you the feeling of playing politics on Mars- er, in Germany. The intricacies are many, and at first it's all you can do to try to make any sense of it. For me things started coming together around the fourth or fifth round after which I was completely crushed, leaving me trying to figure out just how I could have protected my lost glory, and what I could do better next time. My tolerance for long games must be improving because I want to play this again.

2nd game (9 months later): a win! Scoring all five media cubes was key. I'd love to get this out more often, it's absolutely the best 3-4 hour game I've ever played, and basically the only one worthy of that kind of time commitment.

This is a great little game if you have a day free and 4 mates. Probably won't buy it yet as my group has several copies between them already but will definitely buy it if I ever have to move away.

RATING: 8
My hands-down favorite of the long, complicated class of games. I like its balance between control and chaos -- seems like real politics to me. I know a lot of people complain about the public opinion polls "breaking" the game, but I see them as just one more variable you must account for in your planning. After my 10+ plays, I'm convinced that the game is won or lost by Shadow Cabinet cards and careful coalition management.

RATING: 8
The BIG 1 - not the the big Red 1, mind you- this is a legendarily long euro, with complicated mechanics, a lot of long-range planning, a fair amount of interactive screw-age, and a great deal of involvement for players at all times in the game.

All of this is true, but it also has some luck, and relies on optimal action timing to use the limited resources as best as one can to optimize final placement.

After a learning play, I can attest that the many reputations are well-earned, and in fact I would say the only reasons this isn't still in the top 50 are: # Players, Length of game, Availability (currently OOP again).

This game is terrific. It certainly IS a cube pusher, but the tight resource availability, the limited scope of change over time, the thematic depth, and the general involvement at all parts of the game combine to make this a true blue ribbon game (even in the VG 3rd edition).

It's hard to throw out a number, but I am starting this terrific euro-monster at an 8. (That makes Die Macher: (i) equal to the best of Uwe Rosenberg, (ii) the 2nd best 'new to me' game played in 2012, (iii) just on the brink of my personal top 10, (iv) higher rated than I place 7 of the top 10 games on BGG.)

If ever a game deserved a(nother) reprint, with the best graphics, it is this one. It is still one of the best Euros out there, without question.

I was very excited to play this game and it lived up to the hype.  So much going on and so much looking ahead, while at the same time everything is real confined and you're able to start seeing things happening after about the third round.  Great game...top 3 worthy on my list.

This is one of those "Huh—is that all there is?" games.  If you look at the action that takes place on a single board across a single turn, it's really a lot simpler than it looks.  What bulks the game up into hulking-behemoth-of-German-gaming status is the fact that you'll be playing on four boards simultaneously across seven rounds.  Much in the a same way that a full game of Go is more than just four 9x9 games at the same time, a full game of [i]Die Macher[/i] will bend your head to its outer limits as you attempt to do the cognitive push-pull on a bazillion cardboard levers for five hours.

I don't feel qualified to throw an official rating on it after just one play; unofficially I'd give it a 7 or an 8—I'm not really sure right now.  I was underwhelmed at first by the idea that it was just many iterations of the same mechanics over and over with little variation.  I find myself, however, unable to stop thinking about it, much like after finding out the homely girl in your eighth grade class is a fantastic kisser...  It definitely loses points for the fact that it takes five hours and requires a quorum of five players who get all frothy at the idea of spending an entire afternoon LARPing German electoral politics.  I'd like to play it several more times to get a better idea of exactly how I feel about it, but that's going to be hard to do more than once a year or so.  Perhaps I'll have an answer within the next five years.  See you then. 

UPDATE:  Had a better handle on things after a second play, but since it took place a year after the first one, it still felt like a learning game.  On the theme side I really love how cynical (and realistic) the game is:  instead of having the different parties take principled stances on issues, everyone is fighting for the middle, flip-flopping like crazy to maximize vote count.

Played Moskito 2nd Edition (the one with the best graphic design) today.

It's a good game but I don't see myself playing it too often. Also it has the ability of making me very disappointed with some results that happen due to chance. Ther's only so much in this game you can control and that much isn't much.

RATING: 9
Great game but long, and that seems to work against it as most folks cant commit to a 4-6 hour game- so it doesnt get played often enough. However, I love it and find that with the right 5 players (why bother playing with less than that really), it is a total blast. I don't enjoy too much in the way of table talk and while I DO believe that some deal making is to be made. I dont believe that other parties should influence another parties decision against anouther party UNLESS they are going to be in a coalition in the current states election. Just my bit.

GREAT STUFF

RATING: 7
Based on a single play:

There was quite a lot that I liked here but the rating is dragged down by the playtime. 5 new players took a bit over 4 hours. I generally prefer my games in the 2 hour range so I can't really say "I would never turn down this game" like an 8-rating suggests. Sometimes I'm just not up for a 4+ hour game. And I doubt I would ever play this often enough with the same group of people to get the play time down much.

Despite the long play time you're not saddled with heaps of downtime the way Through The Ages is. It was one of the easiest playing "long" games I've played -- and that was with 5 new players!

The game is fairly complicated with lots of inter-relations between bits of the game and various players. Too much for any of us to keep straight at all times. Perhaps with more play you'd begin to see patterns to it?

I have some misgivings about the use of randomness in the game: the game is long enough, and the uses of randomness infrequent enough, that it feels like it could have a huge impact on the game with not enough room to compensate. The difference between a +3 and a -2 on the state currently up for election can be massive. But that's just based on a single play.

Definitely a game I'd play again but the length and number of players means it is unlikely I'll do it anytime this year.

I think the theme is cool, and the length of the game doesn't bother me too much.  It's just too fiddly and requires too much cognition for me.  Trying to see which players match or don't match on what issues just requires too much looking back and forth between cards with similar pictures for example.  Maybe this would be a good candidate for playing as a computer game with a really nice interface quickly telling you all the things that need to be constantly calculated.  Anyway I'd definitely recommend it for any Euro fan that doesn't mind a long game.

RATING: 7
What to say about this one.  There are many little interlinking systems in this game that make up a big uber game.  I played this once, and I can say that luck or player induced randomness made this one a bit hard to swallow.  We played for 3 1/2 hours, which was shorter than I anticipated, but it was hard to take since I had mis-spent my political clout in the beginning and never really recovered.  I'd try again, but it's definitely not something I'd play all the time

Play the german election in 5 hours.  There are ambiguities in the rules that need to be sorted and agreed before play starts.  There is also significant luck in the Public Opinions but otherwise it is fun to play.

RATING: 7
A political game in which you're campaigning for election to the German parliament, but the game manages to be much more interesting than the theme makes it sound. It's very much a collection of Euro mechanisms (auction, majority) with some luck in which platform cards you draw and how easily you can match issues in the larger states, while the opinion polls are a total gamble that sharply contrasts with the deterministic nature of everything else. Among the best of the longer Euros, but there's a bigger luck and multiplayer chaos factor than I really like to see in a four hour game. This is slightly fading on me now I've played a few times, but I don't mind a rerun every now and again.

RATING: 8
Yup, this is a really heavy game, all right.  I think if it were first published today it would probably be split up into at least two games and maybe more.  It's a rather difficult balancing act with lots of rules and many repercussions for every decisions that you must make, but all of the different aspects of the game fit together so well that it is a very worthwhile experience and I am certainly looking forward to playing it again.  I can't begin to explain what the game is mechanically *like* in this space so I will just direct you to BGWS, but let me just say that it is both mechanically interesting and thematically appropriate.

RATING: 5
An overly long game where you seem to do the same thing 7 times and the final result is determined largely by whether you hold the same cards as other people and/or the people in each election.  If you're out of synch with other players, then you'll never get as many votes/points as they will.  A playing time of 2  hours just isn't worth the effort - just roll 2 dice and if you get 10  then you win the game (no need to involve other players and a combined saving of 10  hours).

Just played for the first time - superb - play time would be shorter if we knew the game better and chose to play faster - However I still feel it needs some house rules to play faster. I like the depth of the game and the different choices you had to make (many possible paths to victory). I am desperate to play it regulaly but feel it will rarely get on the table due to equickly popular games that dont take 4-5 hourse to play.

I really enjoy this game, too bad I can't get more players to play more often.  It can seem more complicated then it is.

My lifetime best game! Die Macher has realized the actual political affairs on the board. The game describes political parties, elections, presentation of bills, enlarging partisan, and all different kinds of political undercover struggles.

Description: Campaign for seats in six regions while trying to match nationally important issues and grow your political party.

Pro: Theme and mechanics match perfectly. Many interwoven mechanics require complex strategy. Randomly chosen regions make each game different. Resolving the last two elections at once forces a satisfying climax to end the game. Player interaction and politics play a large role.

Con: Graphics could be better. Game would be more personally involving with a US theme and current issues.

A classic "7". I like it well enough to play it if someone's hot to get it going, but not well enough to suggest it myself.

First game with 5 players. Die Macher is certainly a well-themed game; it really does feel as though you are running an election campaign, although it is a shame that the parties are only differentiated by their name and colour. The game seems to work well, with the only downsides being the length and the role of chance. The rather excessive duration is due to there being a lot of mechanics for a eurogame, the time players spend calculating how many votes the other players could potentially win in the upcoming (and future) elections, and generally the need for a considerable amount of planning. The role of chance is most gratuitous in the opinion poll cards, though the use of dice for calculating changes to party membership also seems unnecessary.

A brain burner that's a lot more interesting than it looks or the theme sounds. Intriguing short vs long-term choices. Hard to grasp as rules are not intuitive; however, once you learn the game, they make sense. Due to all the factors involved, you can't tell who is truly winning until the end. The games I have played have all been closely contested, at least for first. Better balanced when top 4 districts are removed. Pace is good with experienced players. Well worth scheduling.

initial rating

After reading the rules and many hyped forum threads on here this game became one of my most desired games I have ever wanted to play, and I hate Politics. The thing is that even though I hate Politics, this is one of the best themed games I have ever played, that is, the theme works perfectly with the mechanics and it is a very important part of the gameplay. This game went from my most wanted game to play, due to the high strategy element to one of my bigger disapointments for the following reasons:

1. Opinion polls, for a very long high strategy game this element of extreme randomness just seemed out of place and ended up being close to a game breaker. 

2. Usually I don't mind long games but I think this could benefit by being shortened even though it is so damn engrossing that the time goes by quickly, 5 or 6 rounds instead of 7 would be a nice change and I recommend that you try it the first game, I will insist on a 5 round game my next game (if there is one). 

3. Turn order seems way to important in the game, again for a long strategy game this should not be left up to a silent auction (blind bid), an open auction might be better also assuming money is hidden. The better alternative is to leave this as is and change election victory conditions, see #4.

4. The "50" cap on votes seems fine for money purposes and maybe seats/victory points but IMHO total votes should decide who actually wins an election rather than "the last person to get 50 votes wins" which means who ever has the most money will win the auction and therefore win the election, rich get richer. 

5. When winning an election as a "Coalition", the switching of cards on the National Board should be done as the strongest showing switching last instead of first, switching last seems more important and the stronger showing in the election should get to do this not vice versa. 

This game has a TON of potential and hopefully some tweaks will be implemented in the reprint, this game definitely has 10 potential or pretty close to it. As is this is still a great but long game, lots of great mechanics that work very well together, lots of strategy and a strong theme keep this game from falling below an 8, reasons stated above keep it from going higher. After playing some deep games I haven't tried yet which looks to be 10 or so more and then this one some more I will see if my opinion changes and modify my comments and rating accordingly.

I really sought after this one for a long time because it was one of the holy grails of Euro games.  Then the reprint happened and I quickly acquired it.  I read the rules and didn't see the awesomeness.  I couldn't get 5 people for a 5 hour game where there wasn't something else we would want to play instead (Nappy Wars, 18xx, Indonesia, Sword of Rome, Dune, etc.)  Traded away but I could be talked into playing it if nobody brought something more appealing.

RATING: 10
This is truly one of the greatest and most complex games that I've ever played. Notice I say complex, not hard to learn, though the rulebook is large for a Euro game. There's a lot going on and a lot to think about each turn. Karl-Heinz Schmeil brilliantly layers multiple mechanics which just flow seamlessly together. I'm honestly amazed at how well everything meshes together, it goes on just long enough and ends all too quickly. 

While I know next to nothing about the real German political system I do know a little about politics in general and I think the flip-flopping of issues and swaying of the public via the media feels very realistic. You may think the theme will be a bit boring but don't worry it isn't and you won't ever have a chance to get bored anyhow, there's too much going on. 

All-in-all this is a true gem, I give it my highest recommmendation. If you truly enjoy 5-player strategy games then this is a must buy game. 

As far as the different editions go, I've never seen a first edition so I can't comment on that. The Valley games edition was nice and it finally got this game back in the hands of the players. However the Hans im Glick 2nd edition is just superior in quality and coolness. It's the way to go if you can find it at a reasonable price.

Was tempted to give this a '10' if not for how long games take to finish. My friends and I played this at the cottage, we all fell in love with it, very tight design, lots of suspense, it's really hard to tell who is going to come out on top until near the very end of the campaign. Would love to see a developer adapt Die Macher to another political context. Own the 2006 version. Any future versions could use better art/graphic design, art is perhaps the only sore spot in this version, looks like it's bad CGI graphics from the 1990s....
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
If the cards screw you, you're in for a loooong, helpless experience. Initial platforms are determined randomly and you can only change these issues one at a time and only if you draw the cards that let you.

Thus, if your platform is nearly opposite of everyone else's and you don't draw cards to change them, 1) you'll be fighting 4 other people to align any given state's issues to your own, 2) you won't be able to form a coalition with anyone.

As in real politics, you need to be able to drop out of the race so that it doesn't affect anyone else.

Kingmakery at many stages of the game.

The rich get richer. The momentum gets momentumer. ;D

The states' random appearance helps variety but also makes for more chance of a random winner. If you are conservative with your resources, your push for an 80 state in the 6th or 7th round will be huge. Or you might look like a huge idiot. Realistic indeed but not fun.

Plusses?

Absorbing gameplay. The rules, although an initial overload, are theme integrated and logicially formatted--quite elegant.

Overall:  Unacceptable luck to game length ratio.
I love the ideas in this one, and I thank it for spurring ideas in the game industry; but Die Macher really shows its age.

So long!  And so meaty!  And it feels so good while you're doing it!  And when you're done, you just collapse in exhaustion, totally satiated.  *stares off into space, dreamily*

NB: I might be one of the only people for whom this theme is a plus.

The Valley Games version is the reason that I was able to play this game at all. (For that, thank you guys very much.  You provided a much desired reprint, and also helped to drive down the price on the oop versions.)

After the first night of playing (2 games), my group agreed on two things.  The game itself is amazing, and the cards in the Valley Games version are beyond annoying.  It's so easy to mistake the economic, nuke, and even the war on terror cards with each other from a distance.  Why did they essentially ruin their production with symbols that use similar graphics and colors on something so critical to the gameplay?

After the first night of playing, I went to eBay and bought a 2nd edition copy, which has much better variation between the cards.

I truly wish Valley Games good luck on their new company, but their first release has some serious flaws in it.  I will still consider any future games of theirs to see how they are progressing, and it really seems like they're trying hard to do a good job.  They got so much right with their 3rd edition release, it's a shame that they missed on something so key to the game.

A very hard game to teach to other players, but I really like it.  I'm unsure how much it reflects actual German politics, but as an abstract election game, it really works.  Time is again a factor as it takes a very long time (4-6 hours) to finish a game.

This game is awesome.  It has all the stuff that I love about games.  Long term planning, difficult decisions, short term survival, and a great theme.  Some people think german politics is a dry theme but to me all politics is interchangable regardless of where it is located as far as money, media, and party policies.  It's a very fun political game and I have to say that its quickley becoming one of my favorites.

I finally got a chance to play this game and was suprised by how "American" the game felt. Lot's of fiddly bits and rules. A huge amount of upkeep and a very necessary detailed turn chart to plow through every turn. But, I loved it! The game was strategic and multi-dimensional. It only gets a ding for the 4 hours it takes to play.

Everything affects everything else.  You need to simultaneously plan for all the elections currently showing (four) while keeping some resources in reserve for the future.  If you like PoF, and can deal with the 3 hour playtime (assuming your group is fast), and can get four or five players to sit down for this, you'll have a blast.

Whoa, what a big, unwieldy, long, unnecessarily complex, fiddly - and at the same time very intriguing - design! It seems to have at least twice as many moving parts as is needed for a good heavyw-eight euro, but it does seem to hang together very well despite of it.

RATING: 9
Heavy euro about German election, blahblahblah....

Very heavy on the strategy.  Lighter on the tactics.  Die Macher boils down to a game about resource management and subtly managing the state of the game board in your favor.  The game takes place over seven elections, wherein the current and upcoming elections can be manipulated in various ways, and votes can be acquired in various ways.

There are so many ways to score points in this game that it can be maddening, but this keeps AP in check.  There's a different ebb and flow for each player as they focus more or less in different elections.  Heavily contested elections in 5 player games can be very tense, with tons of negotiation over who is going to form a coalition with who (Forced coalitions can be particularly tense, particularly if a player wants to be in a coalition with a different player).

The entire game is a roller coaster from start to finish, and has had a very close ending every single time I have played.


In Die Macher, you're scheming, planning, and thinking ahead so much that the time flies by.



There's one downside; there are some dice that are rolled a few times for each player during a game.  A series of bad rolls can make things very hard on someone.  The art is also too ambiguous and confusing, and while the game plays OK with less than five people, it could use alternate sets of poll cards designed for 4 player (and 3 player) games.

Initial Rating: 7.0  (February 2013)

It’s been years since I heard about this game. I have always heard it was a great game so expectation was high.  I finally played it last week and the verdict is positive. Die Macher is a good deep game, however my (only) game was a little slow because no one had a clear understanding of the rules, thus we made some procedural mistakes and only took 6 turns. I think I like the game but I need to play it again to properly rate and comment. It seems the rules are complex, but once you begin to play, you find the game flows and all works perfectly. Then you find that the rules are not that complex, but the gameplay is making Die Macher a very engaging and interesting game. However, this is not a game for beginners (steep learning curve).

At first, I thought it was a very boring game, now I really would like to play it again soon. (But the theme IS very boring for me). I´m amazed that the game came out in 1986 (I was 4 at the time) still has the potential to beat most modern games. The components are adequate, but nothing that surprises you.

The game took a long time, but I didn’t feel it, all the players were engaged all the time and that is the mark of a great game. It also has negotiating and lots and lots of tough decisions. The key is to stay flexible :D.

On the bad side, there is the long play time (not a problem for me personally, but this makes hard to play the game more often). Also it has more luck than I initially expected from a game this heavy. There is a decent amount of luck on the dice, but what really shocked me was the regional polls. All your carefully laid plans can be utterly destroyed by them and they seem out of place in the, otherwise, strategy rich game.

For now this is a tentative rating, I want to play it again soon to review my comments, but I think it has the potential to go higher in my ratings.

Current Rating: 7.0

It’s been years since I last played Die Macher and my desire to do has been steadily decreasing over time. I’m sure I will play it again and when I do so I will come back to comment again. For now, I´m downgrading its rating.

RATING: 8
Complexity turns a lot of people off, but I love it.  Don't be fooled into thinking this is a pure Euro just because there aren't any guns and it was designed by a German.  There are lots of moving parts, from resource management to a minor area-control aspect to negotiation.  The penalties for not winning regions outright are large enough to be significant, but not so large as to make the second-place finisher feel as though nothing was accomplished.  I'm the only one I know who views the theme as a positive aspect of the game.

The game does take around five hours to play a full 7 rounds, but I don't find it as brainburning as its reputation suggests.  It's not a dreary mathematical exercise at least, and a lot of fun to play during an election season.

After 5 plays I'm moving this rating down to 8.  The theme is still top-notch but the more I play the less convinced I am the game results are meaningful.

RATING: 9
I've finally gotten to play this after years of coveting it; it's fantastic. It's among the best Euro games I've ever played. There are so many interlocking mechanisms! 

You must look ahead while you worry about the current election; you can't win them all so you have to gauge your fights and plan your future battleground states. I think it's a brilliant design.

I fully confess that I don't really know what I'm doing or how to evaluate properly on the whole, but I got stronger at the end of our game. 

This game may be the best 'heavy' game I've played in the Euro/Designer vein and one of the best I've played in a very long time; it is in no way appropriate for most tables/groups. It is most assuredly not for almost any family or casual gamer. That said, I think you could get people to play it if you got them through a game or two. 

It really does play smoothly and if you get the election scoring formula down--and have a good turn explaining player aid (as found on the 'Geek)--it's very easy to play.

I am amazed at the design of this game; the abstraction of a political system, the interlocking of mechanics, the smooth play (once you get the basics down this thing moves), and the speed of time that flew by once we got it rolling: 3 hours went by unnoticed for me. Just, "Wow."

The explanation of the game was thorough, but made the game seem way more complex than the playing of it was. This is just a massive success of design and a game I will own (even if it never sees the table).

Truly fantastic.

Rating this will be hard for me...it's a 10 in design, but it's not one I would want to play endlessly or at every session (no game is yet)...I always struggle with these kinds of games in ratings...

- - Finally played once.  I will definitely be playing at least once over summer vacation, maybe twice more.  This game is DEEP.  It's a brain drain of the most fun kind.  But German politics. . .still scary.

After 5 games, it seems that the praise this game gets is well earned.  Now that I know the rules well, it plays faster (2.5 - 3 hours).

It's long, but worth the effort.  The rules (in every form I've seen them) are fairly poorly written, but FAQ's are helpful.

RATING: 6
I finally got to play this game.

First impression:  I like the game, but it's a little dry and much, much too long.  There is a great mix of skill and luck... the opinion polls, expecially, add a nice random element to the game otherwise it would be really boring.  Money could be a bit tighter but, in the game I played, we just didn't spend as much as we probably should have on many of the auctions.

I think that I'd play again under the right conditions but, because of its length,  it's not a game that I'd put on my Top 10 List.

If the game were re-themed and redeveloped to last only five rounds, I think that it would definitely find an bigger audience. (I have heard that the Valley Games edition has a 5 round variant... must check it out)

If it's on the table, I'd love to play again.  It's a little boring because of its length, which can cause a bit of downtime, so I really can't rate it much higher.  An average game at most.

25.11.2007: Phew! I expect the rating to rise on this one, because it's good. This game has it all, long term planning, tactical play, direct interaction, low downtime, and quite simple rules in the end. But it's also a long game, mostly because there is so much things going on in a round. If all players are familiar with the game you can probably play it in less than four hours, but then you have to stay focused the whole time and keep the analysis paralysis at a minimum. My first game took five and a half hours (setup and rules explaining included), but we were all somewhat familiar with the rules. One other thing that is good with the game is that you can probably start playing right away if you have one person who knows the rules. The first turn you can explain each phase of the round when it happens, and by the end of the round everybody will probably have a good grasp of how the game works. The rules are that simple and intuitive. The only negative thing I have to say about it is the length. It's a game you want to buy, because it's so good, but you know it won't get play as often as you'd like, because of the length.

RATING: 9
In Die Macher ("The Election"), players represent 1 of 5 politcal parties in Germany and try to win votes and influence national opinions over the course of 7 state elections. The primary way of gaining votes in a state is to match your party platform (consisting of 5 cards which define your party's ideas about diverse subjects such as genetic engineering, nuclear power, anti-terrorism spending, social security and so on) with the public opinions of the election state (consisting of 4 cards that equally define that state's opinions on similar topics). Each match is a positive multiplier for votes and each opposite match is a negative multiplier. Through the use of media, shadow cabinet members, and the results of opinion polls, public opinion of your party can also lead to positive and negative multipliers. There are also limited opportunities to change your party's platform to suite the state up for election (heh, heh) and through control of the media change one of the states' opinions on a topic to better suite your party's. Add to this a strong economic element, where money is used to buy media influence, to organize meetings to get out the votes, and to purchase the right to release or bury opinion polls if help or hurt your party. And not only are you doing all of this for the current state under election, but you can also begin to influence elections up to three states ahead of the current election. While all of this is going on, you are also working to expand your party membership and, by winning state elections, help to define national opinions that will give you big end-game scoring bonuses if national opinions closely match your party platform.

Whew. This a lot of stuff to juggle. The game turns consist of about 14 steps that happen in the same order for each election. The processional mechanics keep each step distinct and prevent the game from sinking into a morass of complexity. I think having a casual gamer play with us was a good gauge for how approachable this game is and she claimed to have a good time with it. I cannot think of any individual step or mechanic in the game that felt out of place or that could be improved. I'm scoring this a 9 for now, but after another play or two this could become one of my coveted 10's. If only it were easier to get to the table....

Too randomness for a so long game. It does not simulate a real electoral system and all parties have the same profile at the beginning. I'd say "usually willing to play" if it was shorter. --- Played again seven years later, I still found it extremely long for what it is. There is little chance of changing the own tendencies and, therefore, coalitions.

This is simply my favorite game of all time.  It has many different mechanisms (auctions, turn order, placements, multiple options, resource management) and is a very intense four hour experience that is also an excellent simulation of electoral politics as well as the best game of all time.  I own the 1997 edition from RGG, which improved on the very poor components and sometimes fiddly math from the first edition game, which I started playing around 1990 although I never owned a copy.  Only problem is the steep learning curve, substantially longer playing time (not an issue with me but it is for many people) and finding the right group to play it with.  Definitely better with 5 than 4, and I usually pre-arrange most game sessions in advance although I have had fun in some pick-up games recently.

UPDATE:  Rating still a 10, still #1 on my all-time list, pleased that I got in two full games in less than a week!  (A record except the one time I made it to a tournament final.)  My best description in a nutshell:  Die Macher is truly the Cadillac of all boardgamers.

Immense game, the type you play only once a year. The design is quite unique and fun if people play cutthroat, especially on the biddings. Not quite sure we played with the right rules though.

The implementation is quite bad though (VG version). Horrible graphic design and terribly dull rulebook limits the accessibility of the game. I feel like a large part of the weight of the game is simply due to the poor implementation. There should be an easier way to keep track of multiplier/influence. Poor bookkeeping just lengthen the thinking time unnecessarily.

I enjoy the battle of votes, the balance of trying to plan further ahead vs the need to get money from the current election.  Would rank higher, but I feel like the game ends up being chaotic (player chaos as the issues are changed and game chaos from the poll cards) for as long as it is.

Some heavy games you want to play every chance you get. Die Macher, on the other hand, seems like a once-or-twice a year ritual. 

Good game. Can be hard to remember all the various ways to score points and to internalize the sequence of 15 phases (or however many there are). Made a lot more sense to me on my second play, and that was after a full year had passed. 

Update: with the release of Dominant Species, I'm beginning to wonder about "stepwise" games with 15+ mini-phases to go through each round. It just seems to over-determine the approach. None of my favorite games have anything resembling this, and it's made me weary of trying otherwise intriguing games like The Dutch Revolt. I want to take my turn, not check in for 2 seconds during step 11.

Game ID #1 on BGG and still in Top 50 more than 25 years after its release; Die Macher is a modern classic. Now only Samurai remains to be played from last millenium's  German Top 100 Games.
Die Macher stands out from this group (El Grande, Taj Mahal, Princes of Florence, Goa etc.) with its length, complexity and unusually high direct interaction. Its procedural nature vaguely reminds me of Avalon Hill games from the same time period. Other than that, gameplay is 'Euro' with area majority, auctions and a restricted random factor. In sum, it's a crossover game between Ameritrash and Eurogames from a time when neither term was coined. It's the Dominant Species of German politics.

I am SO not the maker. I might be willing to go again, but the sinking feeling of doing poorly is pretty rough over such a long game. Were I to play again, I'd avoid (I hope) a couple of mechanical errors that hurt and would pay more attention to coalition building and turn order (not to mention winning elections). There's a lot going on here, and it's really kind of cool, so my rating's based more on my personal inclination to play.

A difficult game to rate. There's nothing particularly clever about the game. Its a fairly simple area-majority game with about 15 phases each round. However, all the different phases do seem to gel together very well to make for an engaging game.

Some thoughts:
I would've liked money to have been tighter. It seems way to easy to get money, especially in the later stages and I never felt like I had to save up for anything.
I'm a little iffy about the dice-rolling, however I can accept that it simulates the fickle public quite well.
Valley games have terrible artwork for the cards which really do affect playability. Different issues with similar graphics? What were they thinking?

RATING: 6
I would rate this higher than 9 if we actually played it more than once a year. At 4  hours we just don't do this often enough. Another disadvantage is that you need exactly five players to do it right. I can't imagine a better long game than this though.   Update: lowered to an 8 because it is just so involved that it is sometimes hard to take it all in. Maybe if I played it a bit more I would be able to better manage the disparate activities. I have also cooled a bit on some of the mechanics. I am not a big fan of negotiation and king-making and this game has a lot of it. The blind selections and high level of card luck can also be a bit annoying. It remains an 8 for the moment because I would be unlikely to refuse a session if someone locally planned one on a weekend. Update 2: I have lowered to a 7 as I am gradually tiring of long games in favour of more intense shorter and yet tactically deep experiences. Still a good game that I will play again though.

The game is probably an 8 for quality.  It has some interesting mechanics, but the length makes it difficult to play.  Also, the public opinion polls seem to have a big influence.  Finally, even with good strategy, players can get shut out of policies with unlucky draws.

There's nothing actually particularly complex about this game, but there is a lot going on.  Seven separate elections that you can influence, party membership, the national opinions, your party platform.  Five player game with four newbies took us a little under five hours with a dinner break, so I could see it getting under four.  I could play this a lot.

Provisional rating based on 2 plays.  Die Macher is a game that I've tried to like, but without much success.  Certainly I can respect its intricate mechanics, but it feels too long for what it is.  The theme is present, certainly, but it just doesn't engage me.  There are so many other intense strategic games (Goa, AoS, El Grande, Princes of Florence, Traders of Genoa, etc.) that are shorter, more fulfilling, and simply more interesting.

I enjoyed my experience with this game, but it wasn't the best game ever just because of it's sheer length and complexity.  I didn't like the amount of upkeep necessary to keep the game running, and I also didn't like how the complexity felt very wide but not pinned together at a deep level.  I'd love to play it again now that I have a handle on it, unfortunately it's size makes it prohibitive for most of my friends to learn it and devote 4-5 hours to playing a game.

I've played a few times now.  This game is quite absorbing.  You need to decide where to apply your limited resources.  The uncertainty about the relative strengths of the final Bundeslands adds tension.  And then there's those Opinion polls...I'm ready to play again.

Hard to find 5 (sweet spot) players who are willing to put in the time, but if they know the rules and move fast, this isn't any longer than many other games that hit the table much more.

[b]My thoughts[/b]: 
After only a few plays, this game's beauty and depth can be seen, well not really because you can't even see the depths of the strategy contained within this game at first.  Very deep, balanced, and solid mechanics. Maybe my rating would go down with some plays, but it seems perfect. What an immense and amazing game, you're never out of reach in this one and it goes all the way to the end, there's so much involved in this game that its hard to figure it all out.
Its fun too when you can find people to play and they're fast moving, otherwise you don't even get through a game before they want to stop playing and you're left hanging.

RATING: 4
Judging this game from a 2017 perspective, and Die Macher feels greatly outdated. The game overstays it's welcome with a 5hr playtime of repetitive actions. Love negotiaiton, realistic, money games but this one felt stale. You can get stuck with bad draws with not much to change it, get awful dice rolls that can greatly affect vp, income, have a hard time getting into coalitions because of bad hand draws. Not to mention the common complaint of bidding on hidden polls. I'm sure 30 years ago this was outstanding, but with all the games out there nowadays this gets a thumbs down.

RATING: 7
Very good strategy game with German elections as theme. Although there are some random elements like blind bidding for the opinion poll cards and the dice for party membership, planning and well thought out decisions will mostly be rewarded. The main goal is to get seats/mandates and win elections. Everything you do will influence this in one or another way: modifying your party program to align with the regional opinion (but don't loose track of the national opinion which is important at the end of the game), playing shadow cabinet cards, buying media markers to influence the regional opinion, bidding for opinion polls with the hope of the trend for your own or another party, forming coalitions, organising party meetings, ... All these elements blend together very nicely in a complex, rather long but engaging game. Take in account that the 6th and 7nd election rounds might be very crucial, as the public opinions on the National Board will be hugely influenced by these two elections. ***** Owned, but sold again: 1997 edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I had high expectations before I played this classic, but Die Macher met and exceeded them.  I enjoyed the tension of balancing media, party meetings, and opinions.  I liked the significant but not overwhelming screwage factor, which I had not expected.  Sinking someone's heavy investment in a state election with shadow cabinet members or polls can be a vicious but effective tactic.  The components in the German edition were functional but complemented the theme efficently and aesthetically.

RATING: N/A
First edition. Surprising good condition (box shines as if it is brandnew is a bit dented. Playing pieces are in excellent condition. It seems to me that the game has never been played.


Well after reading a lot of reviews I think this is the best game of them all. Why don't I own it then or haven't even played it?
Well the playing time is around 4 hours. and the comments that with newbies it will even take longer. I rather play two or three games in that time. for now it is a tad to heavy.

However  when I bump into a copy I will probably buy it. I'm curious what the future holds. I even believe that the number of plays in the future could possibly be a reflection of how lucky I am. I could only play a four hour game with people I care very much for. 

Update june 2009 :
I've played the game once now. Not too sure we played the national issues right. They gave me a lot of points.

If The last election was worth more votes than the previous I would have probably won. Or if James lost 2 spots in the preultimate election instead (draw poll)
Allthough Mike would have ended before me. Or if the votes for the last two elections would have changed.

Anyway this tells a lot about the game. It is much closer than I thought it would be and the question now for me now is should it really be so close and and should the winner be decided on the final poll?

Probably not.

I still rate it a solid 8 as I would love to play the game more and see if I could make it more in a game about timing (like Power grid)

If it is more about timing the game will overtake Power grid as my most beloved game.

But to be honest I don't really think so. You could save up the most money and if you draw your card in the final election and move it it could win you the game. 
Even turnorder could decide it.
For a game theat takes over 4 hours to complete it is all a bit to close and lucjk dependant for me.

Having said that there is so much to keep track of and consider. One thing isn't necessaraly better than the other thing so for me it still works.

If The last election was worth more votes than the previous I would have probably won. Or if James lost 2 spots in the preultimate election instead (draw poll)
Allthough Mike would have ended before me. Or if the cities would have been switched for the last two elections would have changed. Or if the winner of the fifth election poll wouldn't have dropped me down two spots (I didn't look in a good shape) because it was the only thing he could do that was worthwhile to him I would have had scored 27 more points in that election and have enough money to compete in the preultimate election. 

So a lot of ifs and I'm pretty sure this goes for a  lot of players. Michael would have won against James if it weren't for me changing the issues after the election. 

Anyway this tells a lot about the game. It is much closer than I thought it would be and the question now for me now is should it really be so close and and should the winner be decided on the final poll?

RATING: N/A
I was so excited to see VG reprinting this, I pre-ordered it without really considering the fact that my friends will probably never play it.

The comic-book font used in the rules, combined with the, uhh, Canadian? writing style, makes this painful to read.  "Unfortunately, a game of this complexity requires more than a page or two of rules to describe it and much of the rules include pictures and step-by-step examples to ensure ease of understanding the game flow."  Gargghh!!  Semicolon!  However!  Comma!

Update: after running through a turn solo to figure out how to play, I think A) instead of actually trying to explain the game to new players, you're probably better off just running all the way through a turn without anyone knowing what they're doing, then starting over for real, and B) after they play through a turn, I'm not sure anyone I know is actually going to want to play this!  We'll see, though.

[i]And,[/i] the comment above about the rulebook being painful to read is perhaps a bit overblown.  The first impression is not great, but the rulebook really isn't that bad.

2015-04-21: succumbed to the reality that this game will [i]never hit the table[/i] except in tear-blurred solo learning games; traded for a game about zombies.

One of the best theme ever. The game itself offers quite amount of decisions to make, allthough there is a huge luckfactor included as well.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Very Hard to find (even online)

Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.

The 2006 edition also supports up to 5 players and adds a shorter 5 round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.

[2016.Feb.1] A classic that must be played by any board gamers. The downside of this game, however, is its overall length, which makes replayability questionable at best.

I never thought I'd ever be interested in playing politics until I played Die Macher.  It has a heck'va learning curve (at least for me) and I think, after a couple of games, I'm still not very good at it.  It is a brain burner and I usually get fried after each playing of it b/c of all the nuances and countermoves I have yet to fully learn.  I only seem to play this once every three years or so b/c there are other long games I prefer to have fun with.

Its as good as everyone says...:-)  Unfortunately, its way too long for most of the people that I know with whom I usually game.  I definitely prefer five players for this game.  Four is a fine game but there seems to be less options for coalitions. A player aid listing all the different phases with the respective actions is a must for streamlining this game and following along.  I love this game as I always lose track of time and never realize just how long it does take!

This is a very interesting and engaging game in which one tries to build up influence through a series of elections.  It is also quite long, complicated rules-wise and more than a bit too fiddly for its own good.  It also seems to have a large amount of chaos for such a long, calculation-heavy game.  Ultimately, however, the game's charm outweighs its flaws for me.

A game on German politics...must be something of interest.  International Valley Games edition is coming in Aug 06.  Arrived at my house in Feb 07.  Heavy stuff.  The game is up to be played very soon.  After play, you won't know this would be a 20-years old desgin as this is such an interactive game and everything affects everything. One slight move would have a huge impact on your long term strategy.  After all, who doesn't want to have a landslide winning election in a major state?  The only downside is the level of abstraction is high to some people, making it difficult to "click-in" or dry after several playings.

It has many layers and nuances and is really quite a lot of fun. Would love to get another session in sooner rather than later.

It really is a thing of beauty. Everything flows cleanly and smoothly, all the mechanics make sense, they all interact well with each other, and deliver a delightfully subtle and balanced game that can and does regularly produce ticklishly evil moments of pure gaming joy.

Very few euros can touch Die Macher in terms of its combination of strategic depth, tactical options, theme, game balance, and subtlety. Not to mention voting on square tomatoes. I mean, who doesn't love - or hate! - square tomatoes?

Long for what it delivers, and needs a complete play to see the entire scope. However, the time flies and everyone is involved at every moment. At its best this game is like candy and very easy to become immersed in. "Theme Theme Theme!"

Our first game involved a cheater so was a major disappointment. He was later impeached and is currently living in poverty in Dusseldorf.

RATING: 5
I very much enjoy the depth and decision making durring the game.  The way various aspects interact and need to be balanced is alot of fun.  Unfortunatily it is also very much influenced by luck.  The last election holds much more weight because of this and at times it can feel like the game would have been much improved by simply removing the first 6 of the seven elections entirely.

RATING: 3
This game was once ahead of its time, which explains the near-legendary status of this title, but its best days are now behind it.

Die Macher is long.  But its greatest sin isn't the length, it's that luck can completely screw a player - for the entire game.  I'm talking about the draw of a player's hand of issue cards.  A bad hand can make for a long game.  And the methods of changing a bad draw are also subject to luck.

Die Macher is repetitive.  The first, second and third rounds are the same as the fourth and fifth.  The seventh round is different, but not significantly so.  It's seven long rounds of the same thing over and over again.

Die Macher is tedious.  The bean-counting in this game is like work.  And your gray matter might be slightly scarred afterwards, and not in a good way.

There are much better titles out there, especially for the time investment.  I'll be avoiding this in the future.

An election game, perfectly realized.  Much of it is a math problem, but at the same time, all of it is intuitive.  Some people don't like the opinion polls, but I think they were handled very well; perhaps too true to theme for some to have comfort.

This is an awesome game. I just don't like the dice rolls and you can get lucky on card draws.  I have now played three times and have been lost for most of the game on all three games. It's a great game but I don't think I have the mental facilities to play it.

My rating is probably too low; I partly feel like I should hold off rating until I play another game of it.  But this feels like a "like it, don't love it" situation.  It is very Euro-y for sure.  Very long, and a lot of balls to keep in the air.  Closest comp for me would be Dominant Species, which is more complicated, but which I liked more; both have a very no-frills approach to visual design, which I'm not crazy about.  Die Macher is very, very fluid, almost abstract, more so than I expected.  I would have liked to see a little more stability, a little more cross-over from one election to another.  Given the time commitment and the need for at least 4 players, I can't see myself playing it very often; if I'm going to play one game for 4 hours, it'll probably be Arkham Horror.  But playing another game where I know what I'm doing from the get-go would be helpful. Consider the rating provisional.

Don't start this game unless you're ready for it. It's a long trek but never dull. Political alliances will be made and quickly forgotten as the focus turns to the next state. This title offers many choices to boost your position or erode those of your opponents.

I've only played it once, but [i]Die Macher[/i] is the meatiest game that I would love to play again. As far as rules go, it's not really that hard; there's just a lot to remember as there are a lot of phases. But it's a brain-burner when it comes to tracking all the interactions that are going on.  The experience itself was not as awesome as I was anticipating; I wanted to come away feeling [i]Die Macher[/i] is the game of the century. But, it fell a bit flat.  I would have enjoyed it more had the others learned the rules in advance. I spent more time explaining things and shepherding them along from one phase to the next than I did analyzing my situation. Nevertheless, I'm looking forward to having another go at it as it's definitely a game with plenty of depth.

2004 Impressions are good after first 4-player game.  It's highly strategic; planning ahead and cooperation (coalitions) is vital.  Rating might increase with play.  We played a couple of rules wrong, and I believe it's even better with five players.

8/2008 Finally managed to play a complete 5-player game within acceptable time.  (Having (at least) one player knowing the game well really helps.)  All players start the game on an equal field with all the same possibilities and "enough" resources.  Winning is just a matter of good planning and knowing which fights to stand and which to ignore.  This is a treasure chest in boardgaming and there's still a lot of depth to be discovered.  Rating up 9 -> 10.

RATING: 9
Valley Games Edition: German rulebook has some translation faults. Rulebook in general could be more detailed in explaining the different phases of a single round. Anyway, Die Macher is still a boardgame classic for gamers who like the heavier Euro games. It takes a few games to get all the mechanics and to know how it all works together. No play and love at first sight but brilliant after a few games.

Finally played this one. Quite long, but we were having fun, so I didn't notice the time go. The fun had more to do with the gamers I played with though. This is a tough one. I can see why many love it: tough decisions, managing your money, where to deploy votes, media, etc. But much of the game is rather "dry," to quote a fellow player. I wasted lots of money on opinion cards that didn't help at all. Perhaps there's a little too much to have to juggle at the same time.

A game about german politics does not sound very interesting at first. It is quite complex, having lots of phases and a rather tricky scoring system. But once you get the hang of it, it won't let you go. The mechanics are actually quite logical and work well together.

[Played once]
While interesting conceptually, it is quite long (and not varied enough to soften the lenght) and random at times (a game based on long term planning that can be affected so much by chance isn't good for me). There are also some "take that!" elements introducing a diplomatic aspect (maybe fitting the theme, but prolonging the game and creating a "metagame" of whining and negotiations).
Too many games with a better ratio between "fun & engagement" and "energy & time spent" have become available in the last ten years. Surpassed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is "THE GAME" If the topic of this game was anything other than German politics it would be the #1 rated game on the list. The game takes 4 hours, yes... but it will be the best 4 hours you ever spent playing a game. Just one point, if you don't like games that have a lot of options, lots of player interaction, a great "screw you" factor, takes longer than 45 minuets, or requires you to use your brain and keep your head in the game, please don't play this game.

Brilliant game.  It appears at first glance to be very complicated but it is not.  Play through one turn for "training pruposes", and it all starts to gel together. Yes, it takes hours to play, but you are in it the whole time, engrossed in the gameplay and working all the angles to get your efforts to pay off.

A little long to me, but very much worth playing the whole time!  Great game and love the mechanics.  Reason it is a 9 is the end game part of it.  Whoever gets the last region seems to have too much sway over the points at the end.  Just what I think.

I threatened to burn this game (it was my copy) after the first three times I played this game (and I actually won one of those).  It is a brilliantly designed game, that I simply do not enjoy very much.  It is a bit too cutthroat for my group, but most importantly, the final tally scoring has no bearing whatsoever on the theme and it obscenely anticlimactic after the election process.

RATING: 7
Played one time. Needs more plays before I give it a "real" rating but it will certainly not be a 10 for me. There are some things I have issues with but would play again to make sure we have the rules (and it is a fiddly monster) correct. 

The Opinion polls seemed overpowered. The are rather random, but thats not the problem, it seemed that the election swung on them (either they helped the guy who won the bid and he took it or they didnt help and he lost.) I will chalk this up to us not knowing what we were doing and not getting votes in an election early enough. 

also the national opinion cards changed very quickly at the end of the game swinging the points for players wildly. Again if i knew this was that easy to do then it might not have been a big deal, but It was unexpected and really messed up the scoring. 

I can see why a lot of folks here rate this game so high. Part of it is due to its (until 2006) rarity. It will be interesting to see if the VG version and the fact that more people will have access to the game changes its score. Also BBG'er seem to like games with large amount of options and this one certainly has that. The question is what percentage of them do anything.

WOW. Played this for the first time last night and was really impressed. We struggled through the rules and the 1st turn, but then once we got the mechanics down, this game sped way up and the brillance of it's design became clear. There are SO many ways to score points in this that it;s overwhelming at first to know what to  do and what to prioritize. I'd love to see this one come out in English!

Engaging, but I'm not sure if it's entertaining. My biggest complaint is that there's too much money floating around. The only thing to soak up the extra cash are the opinion polls - the single most random element in the game. So polls, which could be useless, were selling for 10s of thousands of dollars, far more than the cost of either meeting markers or media markers. So the economey felt off to me - the latter have fixed low prices but seem more valuable than the opinion polls, which always go for exorbitant prices simply because they are auctioned off and there isn't anything else to spend the money on.

The only reason I've scored this as 7 is due to the length of it... over 5 hours the first time we played!  In terms of my enjoyment of the game it would be a 9 (even though I came last).  Despite the length there was pretty much no down-time and I was engaged throughout.  If you don't mind the political theme, this is a truly excellent game and well worth setting aside some time to playing.

I try not to rate games I have little experience of as replay counts for a lot and helps me understand the intricacies of a game. I've not played this one enough to come to a conclusion but, unless we're playing incorrectly, it's not the scary monster I was led to believe. I find Power Grid harder to understand - perhaps this is because there is an inherent logic to how Die Macher (still the coolest name for a game ever) mechanics work, whereas Power Grid is all over the place.

Whatever, I'm looking forward to gaining experience. I wish the cards were standard size though. I don't like these fiddly wee things you get in Euros - Pillars and Thebes are two other culprits. Oh, well... a minor gripe that harms the aesthetic, but doesn't affect gameplay. I know it's just me...

(Based on 1 game only)

Fascinating. A great theme & interesting mechanics (though how well they are married to each other in this game remains to be seen with further play). I don't really think of this as a Euro though, it owes too much to the non-wargames of the early Avalon Hill years. In all cases though, I'm looking forward to my next game.

As it is, I played the 1 game with far too much sentimentality for my favourite German states. Maybe in further games I will be more ruthless, hehehe.

After almost 2 years I finally got to play this legendary game.

Initial rating: good game. Although I had expected a bit more. The final round seems to have a too big influence over the overall game. And there should be less dice-rolling, or more (to even out a bad roll)
This first game with 5 took close to 5 hours, and for a game that long it should be a bit more thematic than pushing around cubes & betting... All the political porties are totally the same in this game, and although that's certainly a cynical thought I can understand, I think it's too far off reality to get the feeling you're really working on elections here by "trading" all the simplistic pro/contra views on issues.

I like the interactivity, and the way the tension slowly builds, we didn't have a dull moment. Basically the mechanics fit together nicely. But it just feels a bit too much of a long abstract with some luck thrown in.

But I'll certainly be willing to play it again to see if my opinion of this game improves.

NL: lang spel wat ondanks het oersaaie thema (Duitse verkiezingen) goed in elkaar steekt.

An interesting game about the German Political system, well not really - but a nice theme. Longer than you first think, clocking in at 4 hours for four players. I enjoy the game, but it's length and complexity (in that it is hard to teach new players) mean it doesn't get played very often.

Wow, who would have thought that german politics could be so interesting?! Lots of interaction, but at the same time players are firmly in control of their destiny. I like the way that future elections can be planned for/influenced, but without having perfect information, and how that information slowly becomes available. The one thing that the game is missing is a card/action that would allow you to draw more party agenda cards -- as it is the luck of the draw can sometimes be crippling, with no recourse for that. I'm sure playtime could go down to 2.5hrs once the players are familliar with the turn order and how things interact with each other.

One of the more impressive German board games ever. Lots of things to do, really no downtime during the four hours - you must keep on thinking all the time, you can't just hang along. Constant reacting to changing environment, lots of tough decisions. Still, after not playing a single game for four years, I sold mine... Not attractive enough, I suppose. Long games are a bit of a problem for me and whenever I get room for longer games, there's been something else I'd rather play.

Indifferent.

One play.  Very nice game that I will play again at the drop of a hat.  The interactions between the mechanics are wonderfully intricate.  The theme really helps one understand the game and makes the game easy to explain to anyone who undestands how general elections work.

Valley Games edition cards are a great example of poor graphic design and the rule book...well they were having a laugh with the Comic Sans font from which you cannot escape - becomes tiresome to read.  However, the rule book content is excellent and I had no trouble at all learning this game.

I need to play again to know for sure, but I think this game might have actually out-Euroed me.  It's a very complicated game with lots of counting.  I hate games with lots of counting.  I don't like it when I can make better decisions if I spend five minutes counting everything before my turn - I'd rather play by feel and just get on with it.  Can't really do that in this game.  I should play again, but whenever the opportunity arises I just don't want to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I finally got this to the table and must confess I had a hard time enjoying it. This was due in large part to taking on both explaining and facilitating the game without having played it before as well as some frustrating behavior from other players, few of whom seemed to be enjoying the game themselves. Add to this the poor graphic design, the senselessly skyrocketing inflation, and other clunky aspects of this extremely long game, and it's tough to be excited about playing it again. I definitely prefer Dominant Species for a "multidimensional majorities" game, so coalitions, which seem to be the uniquely interesting part of this game, to really distinguish it the next time around.

UPDATE: I had a similar experience (muddling through rules, facilitating while playing, whining players) with Struggle of Empires, but I still enjoyed that game, so I'm thinking this rating might end up sticking. Furthermore, that game's excellent Alliance system makes playing this just to "try out" coalition play less intriguing. Basically, Dominant Species and Struggle of Empires seem to cover all the bases I'm interested in for a long game.

This is truly a great game that has stood the test of time.  There is a lot going on in this game--and that, unfortunately, is one of its shortcomings.  There is almost too much going on and the game seems more like a process than a game.  I would rate this game even higher if the time involved to play one game was reduced dramatically.  If you want a solid game "simulating" politics, opinion polls, elections and policy, then this is THE game.  Awards: Counter Magazine Hall of Fame (1998); Essener Feder (1998).

UPDATE: Yes, it's a classic, but it remains impenetrable to me. I will burn remaining brain cells on wargames, but not on this. 

An exceedingly deep and complex Eurogame that transcends the boundaries of traditional Euros.  Beware the brain burn and dominance of the math fiends!  But obviously this game is worth multiple plays and some real thought.  Not as much negotiation as I would have hoped for in a game about politics, but that might have made a long game longer.  Rating likely to rise as I understand the system.

Hans in Gluck version: I have finally found the time and opportunity to play the first game on The Geek.
After the first round when everyone was finding their feet with the game it moved forward much faster than I was expecting and the rounds completed in about 20-30 minutes (with 4 players).
The game is highly interactive and you have to be aware of everything going on around you, so game play is intense. The game itself is not particularly difficult to learn or "heavy" but it is very involving.
I'm looking forward to a second play!

My wife's favourite game. It´s a huge complex heavy game, a gamers game. This game have so many ways to achieve victory. The long version is better than the five round variant, you only know the last round in the fifth end region and that adds a major surprise factor. It's a bit difficult to teach, but not very hard to play after master the rules. My top hot 10 for now. I want to play it all the time. It's a little difficult to find players, because it plays for 4 hours long. Many say that don't play well with 3 players, but i like it a lot. It becomes a bit out of balance during the coalitions, because when that appends one player must run the elections alone. Another reason for the 3 players game must go all the way, 7 elections. But with 3 players with some experience it's possible end that game in less then 3, 30'  hours. And the time as passed without you can notice.

15/03/08 - Another excellent session. Great game, one of the best. In the end of 4 coalitions and 4 hours of game, a difference of only 4 points was between the 3 first players.

Ok game, very complex and lots of decisions to make.  Fantastic player interaction.  That being said, i could play it again but wouldn't be sad if i didn't play it a lot again.

It is a shame that the infamous play length of Die Macher has scared so many gamers away, as this is one of the best games that I have ever played.  Rich in theme, strategy, and depth, Die Macher never feels as long as it is.  Since the game is actually many small actions strung together, there are many meaningful decisions and, even for a first play, players quickly get into the flow of the game.  I cannot ever imagine turning down a game of Die Macher, unless I absolutely could not take the time or there weren't enough players.  Everyone should try this at least once, and I believe that most people will love it as I do.

Outstanding. The most elegant game I ever played. I thought for a long time EL GRANDE was unbeatable in that department, but I was wrong. This game drags down 6 hours of your life, leaving behind one of the most satisfying game experiences you might ever have.
I'm reluctant of giving a 10 after only one game... but for sure, this game deserves it. I'll leave it a 9 for now. Perhaps someday after more games it will become a 10

2007-06-10: Played for second time... WOW... amazing game. I regret I can't give this game a 10, only because I'm not always willing to spend my eurogaming sesion playing only one game. Besides the playing time, this game is perfect.

RATING: N/A
This is a mind and time consuming game . . . . two attributes which I like, but they aren't for everyone.

The depth here is comparable to many wargames, but the game is more subtle in that the means to reach your goal (winning) aren't nearly as clear as attack and win.

Great game, with many mechanics, and the understanding of all are relevant to success.  I love that the game offers several strategies, and that one can, and should, decide among current focus, and future strength.  Although, some limited success in current rounds is often necessary to win, so one can't completely abandon current play.

In our game, the only person not to form coallitions won the game, but I think that the result was more a matter of the group not attacking the player, but that's another great asspect of the game, - the politics and the social engineering matter.

RATING: 7.5
Finally got to play this monster and was generally pleased.
The one thing that disappointed was the final turn (7).
For a game in which I invested 4 1/2 hours, the final turn ended up being discouragingly random and heavily-weighted.
Turn sevel allows no regular play that will affect it, and the flip of the last card can make or break a campaign. Further, the fact that there are no coalitions and that the winner essentially gets to replace TWO of the national policies makes for a huge swing in final victory points.  After a hard-fought game it really all just comes down to who wins the final election.
I was not pleased by this.
Sure, it may be thematically accurate that the entire election comes down to the turn of one unknown policy, but I don't have to spend 4 1/2 hours to simulate something so random.

I'm giving this a tentative 7.5 (the first decimal rating to date) pending another play.

I finally played a grail game. I've wanted to play this game since I first logged on to the Geek back in 2002. It wasn't everything I hoped it would be. Maybe because of just one play, maybe because it was just long, maybe because it felt so chaotic and uncontrollable to me. Either way, I'd play it again, but won't buy it or seek it out to play specifically.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not sure I'd play this one again since it is long and procedural. It features a style of play in eurogames that has gone a bit out of vogue -- similar to El Grande, Cyclades, etc. Whereas newer euros (Feld-style) tend to be indirect conflict -- over turn order, or limited/singular resources -- these first gen euros have more overt conflicts, that involve tampering with your opponents' deployments. I'm not a great sport with these -- I tend not to try my hardest if it's clear I'm not going to win, and instead I start targeting players I don't like, causing mutually assured destruction. It's a style of game that doesn't bring out the best in me. In the multi-player solitaire style euros, there are more compelling puzzles to go for as secondary (or primary) goals, above and beyond the W. For example, optimizing your initial set of cards in Agricola, figuring out how to clear your tableaux in Macao,  trying to fulfill your tasks in Bora Bora. Plus there's just less of an impact in disrupting others' plans; you don't get a lot of misery for your troubles. But with games like Die Macher and El Grande, you can pretty much insure that your target will not win by waging a campaign that goes against their interests, without regard to your own.

I need to play this again to verify my current ranking.  My ranking just seems off - especially when considering what I like in games and what this game is...

I expect my rating to move upward, but getting this to the table is a feat in itself.

It takes more than an hour to explain the rules, if you survive that and have five more hours you may enjoy this complex game, but only if you don't mind the considerable luck element in a gamer's game. One lucky card after five hours of play can win or lose the game for you. Luck certainly has some role in real elections as well. I think this is one of the most overrated games on BGG.

This game feels more like an exercise in bookkeeping. I keep hearing the same comments made about this game, "It takes a bunch of plays before you really understand the strategy". I don't want to sit through a painfully dull 4+ hour game several times before I even have an inkling of the strategy. I'd rather eat a thumbtack.

Seems to be worth the legendary fame. Lots of rules but they offer a lot to play with.

There was two years between my first and second game. In that time I had forgotten almost every possible rule that there was to forget. I think this is the biggest flaw of the game. There is so many little or big things you should be aware during playing. If you can get this played at least twice every year this might not be a problem but I'm not sure if I'm able to do it. This is bigger problem of the player rather than the game. The game is very good.

This is the best cube management game I have played. Die Macher has a good theme (hey, who could resist German politics?) and the system offers endless possibilities for strategies and tactics. Negotiations and long term planning are the best things in this game. There is some luck involved but that is fine as it does not dominate the game. Oh, did I mention you can easily screw your neighbor? Liked by everyone I have played with.

This game is a great example of the concept of "emergence": many simple systems interact with one another to create a whole that is more complicated than the sum of its parts.  A deep, deep game with lots of thinking to do.  Plus, it's lots of fun, and doesn't feel like 5 hours long.

The classic big game Euro. The luck comes in torrents, from the polls, to getting lucky matches in the big scoring regions.

Each time I play I have to learn the game again. Not that it is very complicated mechanic wise, but it is a game that should be played at least a few times in a row to get the hand of where to spend, what to bid and which elections to take part in. You need to constantly keep track of your party platforms as they effect so many parts of the game, including elections which are the key to getting points (since they give you points during the election and give you a chance at getting points later). There is a lot of thought as actions will effect many parts of the game. The theme fits well also, which adds to the game play.

While this game really has a lot going on, it all seems to tie together very well.  Players are attempting to get votes in various regions by setting up party meetings and gaining multipliers, though either issues or public opinion.  There's a lot of future planning in this game, as players can see (though not perfectly) how upcoming elections will go for them.  I like the option of being able to lock in your votes early; not being able to lock up an election win early prevents this from being abusive.  That said, I wish there was a way to streamline this game somewhat, so players wouldn't get caught up trying to analyze 20 different factors when making each decision.  Additionally, the money got a little ridiculous toward the end of the game, when the quantity of it greatly increased and the usefulness of it greatly decreased.

Finally I got to play Die Macher, the grumpy old grandfather of modern Euros. With the optimal 5 players and it was a fun group too...

Considering Die Macher was published in '86, much in it still feels fresh. A bit procedural though, the owner of the copy was "game master" and was using the "check list" to keep us going through steps and phases in the right order. In a modern design, steps and turns are usually more intergrated in the game visually on the board he thought, and I think he is right.

A "heavy" game, at least for me, and it took me almost 2 elections before I had sorted out all the details. Managed to squeeze out a win by doing extremly good in the last region (a 80 point election).

Give it an 8 for now, could definitely rise with more plays. A long game for sure, and a bit dry, but still thematic and very engaging. Played the "Valley games" edition, some of the icons on the cards were confusingly similar..

This game has an incredible amount of excruciating long and short term decisions.  Get caught up thinking too much is important, or the wrong thing, or oppose the groupthink on the issues for too long, and the game gets away from you.  The polls can be volatile or nearly useless, making them dangerous to ignore and dangerous to overspend on.  A handful or two of mechanics lumped into one very enjoyable and deep game.  Five player game took about 4.5 hours (after rules explanation with 4 new players), four player took 3.5.

A very procedural game, with good opportunities for swinging the odds in your favor over time. It also allows for you to not lead the game and still win enough votes over time if you can manage to keep a consistent good place. The re are unexplored opportunities on the area of coalitions whether forced or agreed upon, where you can take a leader down by getting together with another player in agreement.

This game is fantastic but is undoubtly an "older" game, there have been some incredible mechanics advances in the gaming world over the past 10 years and this game is lacking them.  What they need to do is get someone like Reiner Knizia to completely redesign this game in anyway he likes an call it "Die Macher II" - then it would defintely be the greatest game ever.  Another thing, just like designers are always trying to make a 'playable' Civilization game, I think the quest for a 'playable' Die Macher game would be a real gem.  I really wish more political themed games were designed.

I've thrown down my pre-order from Valley Games .. It's all paid up.  Now I wait.

Arrived!

UPDATE:  The rules are crazy.. so is the concept.  I think I may just have to play some solitaire first before I even try and sell my friends on this game.

UPDATE:  After sitting through the Board Games with Scott episode of Die Macher with a friend (A must see!!) I breathed a heavy sigh and thought, "Awesome... but not today."  This game will require heavy planning ahead of time to see the light.  But it will.  It's staying in my collection for sure.

UPDATE:  I finally tried to get the game to the table.  I even scheduled it in Facebook for crying out loud.  My players bailed on me and the game didn't take place.  It's just too daunting for some.  Very frustrating.  

UPDATE:  I've now played this after, most likely, two years of owning it.  Worked out something like this:

11:00am - I watch BGWS episode on 'Die Macher'
1:45pm - Guests arrive
2:15pm - Guests watch BGWS episode on 'Die Macher' (they hadn't seen it)
3:15pm - Potential to be overwhelmed steps in.  Make a quick snack and have a coffee.
3:30pm - Start.  Players are given colours, and play begins.
4:15pm - First round done.  ([I]Seven of these??[/i])
5:40pm - Hungry, must order pizza.
6:20pm - Pizza arrives, break for dinner.
7:00pm - Resume
8:00pm - Friends stop in to say 'Hi'
8:30pm - Resumes
9:00pm - "So waitaminute, we [i]only score[/i] on round seven?!
~10:00pm - 

Black / CDU/CSU / Karen - 215
Red / SPD / Dan - 223
Green / Die Grunen / Pam - 303
Pink / Die Linken / Dave - 276

11:00 pm -

A fun game.  Heavy on the brain, but exciting.  We played it incorrectly on a few points (adding up party increase correctly based on party platform that matches national opinion and having the bonus for having more votes than all others combined in a district, amongst others) and decided not to revert to the correct play as not to penalize anyone.  We could see that it would be tight, but also knew by the end of round 5 that Dan and Karen didn't really have a chance to win.

I own the valley games edition.  We all agreed that the iconography was poor.  There was an understanding by the group as to why there was no text on the cards (even if we all agreed that it would be better to have had it), but we didn't like how the icons were difficult to tell apart from across the table. This slowed things down while players had to reach over to double check the opinion cards both players and districts.  I would very much enjoy buying a new set of cards that are closer to the original game (well, the HiG edition that was on BGWS would have been great.)

Also - the pink colour is pretty interesting, and I only assume that the colour was chosen over blue was because pink [i]actually is[/i] associated with "die linken" in German politics.

Giving this game a 8.  Would love to play it again but would enjoy it more if there were not so many breaks.  I give this [i]Edition[/i] of die macher a 3.  I just find that the choices made by the art department were bad.  Front the front cover to the rules to the board(s) to the cards.  There is no localization here and the lack of text on the cards is frustrating.  We all agreed that the game would have been better if the cards had SOME kind of text on them - even German.  At first it was confusing to see red checkboxes and red 'down arrows' and understand they are the same, when all throughout the game everything depends on icons matching.

Icon choices are also bad.  Clip art would have been better (or at least easier to discern from a distance).  All icons.  (let's be real here).  The new icons are complicated and lack simplicity.  The backs of the cards are bad.  All of the backs are the same (blue cloud-like pattern) but have a graphic in the middle.

The shadow cabinet round suffers because there is no text on the cards.. "what am I playing here?  A whip?"  This detracts from the mood and does not pursue theme.

Rule book is well-written.  Technical writing is well done.  

I, personally, do not like the art on the box or the fonts, or anything about the box.  I find it very unappealing.  Unfortunately, this theme of "design choices I do not agree with" is carried throughout the entire game.

As an interesting case study, the game has been designed to be sold in any language right out of the box (cd included for rules in many other languages) and as such, pulls the text from the cards. We found that decision to be detrimental to the game.  Any text is better than none in this game.  I also have to rate it so harshly because [i][b]these design choices impact the desire to play this game again in a negative way.[/i][/b]

I'll be lucky to play this game twice in a year.

As a game system this is outstanding.  The theme truly feels like it comes through in the gameplay, but this can also be a negative.  The bitter struggle for political power seems to encourage backstabbing and merciless attempts to crush your opponents, making Die Macher a political "wargame".  The 5-6 hour playtime is what really lowers the ranking for me though, as there are only 7 (six really) turns which take a LONG time to complete.  I'll admit that shorter "euros" are more my thing in general, but I wish this game took less time to play.  For the time commitment, I'd rather play 3-4 games of El Grande.

The core idea here is you place cubes into regions and then those cubes become worth points based on how many of the issue cards in that region align to the issue cards in front of you. For having the most points in a region, you also get the special reward of trying to groom the endgame scoring requirements to match what issues you want them to be. The game has some decent amount of flip luck, and planning too much to set up future turns has a way of backfiring pretty easily as players slip the issues cards, and your multipliers out from under you. Ultimately I found this game a little too complicated, chaotic and long.

I've been meaning to try Die Macher for a long time but not found an occasion. A Sunday in August (09) saw five of us gather together at my place armed with player aids, bratwurst and sauerkraut. For all its fearsome reputation, the gameplay is reasonably smooth, broken up into lots of little phases, and we only screwed up one rule. The integration of mechanics with theme is what really makes the game hang together for the 4-5 hours it takes to play, even if that theme is German regional elections! It took a few rounds to begin to understand what I was supposed to be doing, and I'm definitely keen to give it another go now my head has recovered.

Plenty of mechanisms all layered onto the core game concepts and with each interacting with one or more of the others. Very nice balance between fully tactical (this region's election), near term (the next three regions) and strategic (the national board's party size and policy alingment areas). While bidding can seem somewhat random early on, I think this was due to our not fully grog'ing the whole interconnected game design. Bidding was much more focused and fierce in the latter half of the game. Kingmaking is avoided to some degree as the ability to deduce who is truly ahead is out of reach (although some folks will still identify a leader and act based on that).

Has a lot of moving parts, so it is hard to explain and get started but once you've played a few rounds you see how the game flows. Definitely get some of the player aids with what happens on each turn so one player can "drive" the rounds.

The game has a good tradeoff between taking advantage of the current position and planning ahead. It is good to see how you can position yourself for future actions. 
Great decsions on where to put your resources - media, faction members and when to cash in those members for votes - there are tradeoffs to release them for other use and current board position. Your balance between the issues of importance to your party versus the local, versus the national, making coalitions, setting up your national strength - all in all a very rich game.

I have played it only once but found it to be a very good game. The theme is not for everyone and I have seen many people waving it off in sheer fear due to its "heavy" and "dry" theme. As usual, if you look behind the theme, the game is a good one, which is not as hard to learn as the legend has it but very hard to master and definitely not for those players who do not like to think ahead. In fact, the crux of the game is that you are pretty much playing four game rounds at the same time, while the first one will be resolved next and so forth. Although I am German, the theme does nothing for me (Elections ? Yawn), but it does not deduce from the fun either and I suppose it is the only theme that works with all the mechanics, knotting them together in context. The theme and lack of randomness makes this a 9 for me and the fact that it rarely sees play pushes it down to 8.5. Nevertheless, a great game indeed !

RATING: 6
One of my biggest gaming disappointments of all time. Based on all the hype, I had great expectations. Too much Euro and not enough politics and diplomacy. I felt like pushing cubes around a board, not making deals and reacting politically. Politics should feel like politics, not a math puzzle.

Pretty good game.  Lots of options and choices to be made in this complex resource management game.  It's kind of uninspiring and I found my interest really waning towards the end despite the game being undecided and myself still in the running.  Mechanical. It does have excellent long term planning required, however, Louis XIV accomplishes many of the same things in less time.  I like long games, but only if they hold my interest throughout.

First play took seven hours, and I wanted to play it again the next day.  That might say enough right there.  A little something for everybody -- a little auctioning, a little dice, a little negotiating, a little card management, a little money management, but it all works together.

Wow! I had not been too keen on trying this game as I thought it would be too solitarish, but was finally convinced at giving it a go at Spillorama 2010. And what a blast! This was a great experince and I can't wait to play again. 5 hours with 4 players of which 2 were newbies. Yes, there is a bit of luck with the poll cards, but that is why you want to win the auctions for them. This will be directly put on my all time fave list.

I want to like this more.  It's just too many systems to keep track of and if you miss one little fiddly thing, the whole 3.5 hours goes down the tubes when you realize it 2 turns later.  I'm sure it would be better if played with people that play this more often.  Don't try with all noobs!

Classic Eurogame... this puts all the new eurogames to shame.  I can't belive how well thought out this game is.  All the mechanics have a counter balance and players can't score in all areas well.  It does run a bit long, but it is worth the effort to play.

RATING: 7.625
This is a very interesting game with a ton of potential.  A lot of how I feel about this game really depends on how long the game takes.  At 3 hours, this is an epic game.  At 5 hours, this is a good game, but nothing I want to play often.  At 6+ hours, this is a painful experience that is hopefully confined to the learning game.

This game is fantastic and it really is quite intuitive to play.  Set it up and go through one election and everyone should be ready to go, in our game we didn't even start over but continued until completion.  With three players it took us 4 hours to play a short game and the first hour and a half was trolling through the first election with the rulebook.

I am so excited to get this to the table again!

RATING: 6
Die Macher is a genuine "gamer's game." With its complex rules and strategies and its great length, it is not a good choice for inexperienced or casual gamers. For myself, I think it's a good game but too long and fiddly for the amount of fun. I also prefer games where I can build something and rely on it; in Die Macher there are a million ways for the other players to mess with everything you try to do.

How could anyone guess that a game themed upon German legislative elections could be so good? And thoroughly enjoyable, despite the many hours of play-time? The key is an incredibly solid system with perfectly-matched phases and lots of options for fine-tuning your tactics. Brilliant.

Good, very interesting game.  Has some flaws: money spirals out of control as the game goes on which is weird, too much hinges on the last two provinces, the popularity polls inject too much randomness.  Intense and engrossing, there is no parallel multiple-solitaire play here: everything is player vs player, sometimes as coalition partners, sometimes as enemies.

I was finally able to get in a game of Die Macher at a con this past weekend and everyone's comments about the game proved to be true.  Incredible number of options; you're always paying attention to what's going on; plays in four hours, but seems like one-and-a-half.  Tremendous!!

Bought on reputation back in the days when it was camped in the BGG top 10; I think it's fairly average. Very hard to get to find a group for a five-hour game about German politics. The few plays I've had sugest that it's a bit fiddly by today's standards.

Played twice now. A game you come away from more impressed (and fatigued) than pleased. The union of so many mechanics is genius, as is the physical presentation of so much information. Appealing fidelity to the theme. However, falls short of being a favourite owing to the length combined with luck element of the draw. I could see my rating for Die Macher increase if I played it repeatedly with a committed group.

Still not sure about this game after my first play. It was quite fun but there was one issue: 'more mechanisms for your buck than any other game' I paraphrase one of the other players, but yes this game actually has multiple variants of mechanisms all squeezed in, no less than three different types of auction, majority and largest control. Wow...

RATING: 7.8
(+) Refreshing theme
(+) Interesting and original gaming mechanics, very interesting way of planning ahead. Balance between strategic and tactical play.
(+) Some fierce bidding rounds and some very interesting negotiation aspects
(+) Structured flow of play

(-) Bad Artwork (3rd edition), some symbols are unclear -> that's why I [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/1979733/die-macher?size=large]redesigned the cards[/url]
(-) Some luck dependance with card draws, however the game rewards clever play and doing good risk-assessment during planning should ensure good results on the long run
(-) Quite lengthy game, I don't mind this so much as it is a truly satifying experience in which time flies by, but it's not always easy to find people who are willing to commit so much time and thought into such a title, a shame really.
(-) Potential for a run-away leader problem: winning elections brings income and party membership. This can be used to make life miserable to those who lag behind.

Approx gametime: 50 - 55 min / player

I had just been introduced to Euro gaming when the Mad Anthony Gamers introduced me to Die Macher, an extremely exciting and lengthy game about... German politics.

Well, I never knew that German politics could be so fun! The fun part of this game is in the planning. At first I fond myself thinking only one or two turns ahead, but I soon found out that you really have to plan a full game strategy in order to do well. Planning when and where to spend money makes this game extremely exciting.

The best part of this game for me is the fact that you don't have to win each battle to become the dominant political party. There are enough ways to score points to run a myriad of strategies in this game. I look forward to more Die Macher games. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Probably the best poolitical game.  The only real problem is the money and polls--you have too much money (especially late in the game) and often have little to spend it on except "polls" (so large bidding wars devcelop on random cards).

Captures some elements of politics by forcing the players to change their party's policies or try to change the mind of the electorate.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Solid game.  This rating has slipped from 8.5 after our last play.  I guess I'm just wishing that, for a game where the last ten minutes are so "swingy" this was just a little bit shorter.  The mechanics are obviously very good, but I just feel like the balance is a bit off, that the game is a bit too back-loaded, with the end MUCH more important than the other parts.  It's pretty important not to appear to be doing too well heading into the last few elections, since people can absolutely savage a leader in the national issues, erasing hours of lead-building.  None of this would faze me at all in a two hour game.  Still, it's clearly the best election game I've ever played.

I wish like hell that there was a game of this caliber that focused somehow on American politics.  Ah well.

It's a Game I will never say no, it takes a little to play (4h30 the only time I played it) but the time flyes and you don't feel it. A Must Play Game.

I think that with more plays my Rating will go up.

The first time I played, I spent 2 hours miserably asking why did I agree to fill this out. (I can understand how the learning curve could turn some off.)

You want to play this with 5 people who want to play, 1 or 2 who have had their arms twisted can easily ruin it for all.

--Sep2013-- Way too long to get it to the table. (It arrived in my house in Feb of 2006!)  But really quite worthwhile when it finally happened.  It's got some randomness; some serious volatility; and lots and lots of opportunity for clever (or, in my case, foolish) play.  Really happy to play it again - though it may be a while.  I'd be sad if it took more than a couple years to play again, though.

RATING: 9
Maybe one of the smartest games I've played.   My first play resulted in a win for me that was mostly blind luck on my part as I was counter to the issues all game until the final election, which I won and was able to change the national opinion to my favor...  so needless to say, I had a favorable reaction.  Since then I have lost one game by a large margin and still think it is a superior design.  

I would gladly rate this a 10 if not for the terrible graphics used on the Valley Games ed.   No offense to them, but the generic looking digital art is way to small and entirely too difficult to see across the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is an EPIC game! I expected it to feel at least a bit dated, given both the year it was produced and that games, in general, keep getting more refined over the years as designers build on what works and get rid of mechanics that don't. I was surprised to find that this is pretty much perfect.  

We played a 5 1/2 hour game with 5 players which is a true tribute to our teacher, since three of us were new to the game. (You rock, Melissa!).  It didn't feel like five hours at all - THAT'S how engaging the game is.

I made mistake after mistake, but had a blast!

After 2 and a half games, I really enjoy Die Macher. It's easily one of the best games in its class, and I really like how it uses the various design philisophies of Eurogames to it's advantage. You are usually engaged in something, there's a lot of balance in different actions, scarcity of actions and money is a factor, and each round is broken into over a dozen steps. But it flows very well with a little experience, and the result is one of the deepest, most rewarding games around. It's very long, but if you block out the time and someone knows how to teach, you can make an evening of it with no problem. It takes some effort to learn and play, but if you can find the time, this is highly recommended.

For such a brain burning game, with lots to analyze, I find the importance of luck and especially winning last round a bit too great.

A staggeringly brilliant design & execution -- far and away the richest gaming experience I have ever come across!  Not the easiest game to teach and learn, but well worth every minute of it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I think this is one of my three favorite games of all times.
It takes some time (about 3-5 hours), but the best thing is: You can play it, WHILE you learn the rules. All the mistakes you make in the first round, don´t make you loose the game. You can win anyway.
The game is so well balanced, so complex, has no "luck"- factor and is yet so easy to learn... fantastic! (and it gives a quite nice overview about how politics really work - "We stand for "We are absolutely against atomic energy!!!" - unless the people want it!"
If you like:
- El Grande
- Making of a president
- Libertee
- Princes of the renissance

then you should defenitly buy this game.

It's gone down in my ratings for the complicated long German game category, but it's still a classic and I'd miss playing it occasionally. As an election night game with players who know the rules you can appreciate the design and feel it's worth devoting three hours to it. There's a little too much luck in the cards, fiddly rules & after several playings the shine has worn off somewhat. However, once a year and it'll remain appreciated.

There is almost no downtime as each player makes many small decisions concurrently with each other to move through the 11 (11!), but tiny, phases of the turn. And, each decision matters and can have a bad word inducing impact on the other players - no multi-player solitaire here. I wouldn't want to play the game all the time - it's mentally taxing - but I'll still look forward to seeing it hit the table again sometime in the future. 

It takes time to come to grips with the many and varied moving parts that is the engine called Die Macher. It's what I imagine trying to fly a helicopter would be like - every adjustment affects some other system which then needs to be adjusted, which affects another system, and so on.... An exhausting but thoroughly entertaining ride.

Complex game that is time manageable now thanks to the "short-game" rules. Rules are very clear, and easy to understand. It is the interaction of all the phases and putting them together into a winning strategy that will melt your brain (in a good way.) See my session report for more details and first impressions.

Would rate this higher if it was a bit less random, still it is a very good game.  Optimal play is with 4 players, 5 is too many as it makes the game too tight and usually forces at least one player into a unwinnable position by midway through the game.

[1 play] I could see rating this a 10 and I could also rate it a 6 or 7. Let me explain. 

10 for the amazing way this game keeps everyone pretty well occupied downtime free for 5 or 6 hours, and 10 for the wonderful blend of mechanics (published 25 years ago, hello!?) offering layer upon layer oflayerlayerlayer of crazy strategic possibilities.

7 (or maybe 6) for the huge doses of luck that hop in occasionally without warning, which is a bit shocking in a game of this length. 7 or 8 for the honest reflection that I want to limit the frequency of gaming where I play monster length games multiplayer, so by the bgg ratings dogma it can't be a 9 or 10 since I don't want to play it all the time, maybe more like once or twice per year.

Most recent play 2-25-12 with Donovan, Garrett, Corey, and Michael.

RATING: 6
Sure, the game is well put together and works as a system. However, I'm not sure the 4 hours payoff is worth it for what is essentially an area control game with multiple ways to score.

I don't really get the feel of changing opinions and running the machinations of political jostling. The game gives the illusion of long term planning and strategy yet some of it's mechanics seem counter that. For example: public opinions for future regions aren't completely revealed. Players who decide to invest in future regions (media markers, etc) are essentially gambling on what's flipped over. The dice are a really bad idea (tie breaking is silly). The bidding may go high for opinion polls that seem to have too much of a random swing.

Somehow, the game is hyped. Why? I put it down to nostalgia and gaming snobbery. I do agree that the 4 hours passes pretty smoothly but I'd rather play a few other games or a longer game with more tension and dynamic structure.

Finally played this, over three years after buying.  It is very good indeed.  It would be a possible 10 except for:
1) very long playing time (although the time is worth it).
2)quite daunting learning curve for the first game.
3) the appalling design of the Valley Games cards - a printing error which would have made a key rule inoperable (if not for BGG to clarify the query), and - dependent on lighting conditions - three of the six party policy cards can be indecipherable from each other at any distance.

Politics, Economic, Auction. Players represent different parties in the German political season. Finally got a 5p session in. Really like it. Can't believe this game came out in 1986 - a Euro ahead of its time, still very solid now. Tons of little decisions (somewhat tactical in nature) that add up to a long term strategy? Lots of interaction, lots of ways to earn points, and not as long as we'd feared (about 4 hours total for our learning game, I think we can get that down to 3ish now that we know how to play).

Looking forward to more plays, possibly at BGGcon 2008. Rating may go up.

A háborús játékokon kívül a BGG legösszetettebb játéka. Jogosan érdemelte ki ezt a címet, ami a német politika választásról szól. Nagyon sok mechanizmus, nagyon sok figyelembevevendő feltétel és előrelátás szükségessége jellemzi a Die Machert. Nekem a téma és a megvalósítása száraznak tűnt, az első játékos jogért menő licitálást meg valahogy nem értettem. Pont elsőnek lenni volt rossz érzésem szerint a játékban. Jó játék a Die Macher, de valahogy végig olyan érzésem volt játék közben, hogy inkább játszanék egy Caylussal, egy Age of Empiressel ha már nehéz játékot kellene választani egy délutánra, mint ezzel. Ettől függetlenül akit a téma érdekel és szereti a komplex, gondolkodós játékokat, annak mindenképp ajánlható.

First play for all five of us clocked in at 5 1/2 hours - pretty much right on target.  Kind of a brain burner, but I think all of us enjoyed it quite a lot.  I know I did, but then a win at first play always gives one a good impression of a game.  Little down time, since all are involved in every aspect of each round. Thanks Ken, Gail, Brian and Alan!

Played once with some good friends and to be honest, I don't have any idea how to rate this thing. I'm sure that it is a masterpiece of game design and I trust that there is some absurdly abstract level on which all of Die Macher's moving parts link together to form a wooden cube-fueled engine of Euro-elegant perfection, but years of playing games with lasers, dinosaurs, spellcasting, explosions, etc. prevents my Ameritrash-rotted mind from tapping that divine lattice.

Long, but surprisingly good political game.  There are seven regional elections in seven rounds.  You represent a German political party, and you win elections by matching your platform of issues with the regional attitudes.  You have opportunities to influence the media and populace by investing resources into a region.  Winners of the elections get cash and, more importantly, can influence the national agenda.  The player who has the most comprehensive and substantive alignment with the national agenda (determined by matching the national platform, size of party membership, and media presence) after the seventh round wins the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a fun game with scads of interlocking game mechanics. And, surprisingly enough, it seems to capture many of the machinations that politicians actually attempt, to gain any advantage they can.

Downsides: the cards are poorly designed. If only they could've been made with larger, simpler, clearer icons. And as for the rest of the components, they work fine, but the color choices are awful: pink, lime and lemon--yuck.

To be really good at this game, you have to play it a couple times just to understand what is important. Actually, everything is important. Rather, you have to understand how everything works together (and that'd take a few plays), so you can come up with a coherent strategy.

If someone is afflicted with the Paralysis of Analysis, they could make this game realllly drag. (Of course, they could do that for practically any game.)

Ahhh, I finally got to try the fabled Die Macher.  It more than lived up to all the hype for four engrossing hours.  Could end anywhere from an 8 to a 10 upon further playings, which I hope will be soon. Update:  As much as I enjoy it, there is a bit too much luck and randomness for such a long game.  Also, the new version has cards that are susprisingly hard to distinguish.  I much prefer the original.  I do thoroughly enjoy it and wouldn't turn down a game (as long as I had a few free hours!)

Played it for the first time with 5 gamers. I like this game a lot. It has a unique feeling. I ended up ok although I usually can't play it properly. I guess I had lucky!
Most of the time polls are a bit frustrating because we often buy innocuous ones. That's a major complaint about the game due to its randomness but I still think that despite all of that Die Macher is a different game that feels differently and makes the difference especially when compared to new boardgames which, most of them, seem the same.
I like the way everything is combined. The difficulty in choosing the right issue to be for or against, a struggle against chaos and randomness. I believe that if a player doesn't stick too much on his luck and manages to do well or at least try to do well in major elections, he is able to win the game. Opinion polls may destroy a strategy on the short run but I really am convinced that that is not possible if polls are controlled in the long run, saying 2 elections ahead. If players can get 30 votes in a long term election probably is a good idea to grab those 30 votes before a poll goes wrong. Plus, good (forced or not) coalitions can make a difference in the national board which can be important. Getting media control is also an excellent way to get points from the national board and also to buy cheap polls - I guess that if a player has media control over a region the other players often tend to let him grab the poll.


1. Polls may be bought. If a player wants that poll if he thinks that is a critical region/election he may buy the poll or even try to control it using the media. This is a decision made by the player. The key word here is decision. If, for some reason, the player can't buy that poll he should have prepared himself better for that situation by:
a) saving the money needed as he thought on that region as a key election.
b) preparing himself for the case that he can't get the poll by playing ahead making some damage control

2. Issue cards are random as in all games that play with cards. In Die Macher there are always 4 elections in dispute and with those 4 elections, 10 issue cards are open. Players have the possibility of choosing from 6 cards to play as a party campaign so, I guess it's not just about luck, it often is about trying to get everything. It's better to control the elections on the long term because those regions only have a single card showing so, no more complaints about luck on the cards because, although they can make things easier they are not impossible to control especially in future (with a single or two cards showing) elections.

3. Dice. Well, there's nothing to do with dice. Sometimes they work for, sometimes they work against. It's just how they work. But they work like that in all games with dice and, in my opinion, they are not that relevant. I believe in odds and, although a player can have luck (or lack of it) for all over the game, that's against the odds so it's more likely to have players with luck and with no luck during the game.

Die Macher is an euro game that is all about making the right decisions and try to "cut losses" where possible. There's no way a player with lack of strategy and well playing can win this game.

This is definitely one of the games of my life.

RATING: 6.5
Heavy euro from days of yore about manipulating German state elections. Players control political parties vying for seats in seven successive elections, each in a different region, with seats translating to points and other benefits. There are half a dozen ways to build up seats, but the key one is manipulating the issues. Each region is either for or against four of seven hot-button political issues (genetic engineering, nuclear power etc.); tailoring your party's platform to match, or at least not directly contradict, increases your score multiplier. But it might be simpler to acquire control of the media and simply change the public's mind...

The best part is that four of the elections are in play at once. While others squabble over the election being resolved right now, you can be laying the groundwork for crushing victories elsewhere. 

There's more to it than just the elections but it is not outrageously complex -- certainly no more difficult than a modern uber-euro like Trajan or Terra Mystica.

If it's harder to play than your standard Feldian mishmash it's because it is open, opaque and somewhat uncertain. Attempting to divine other players' plans for particular regions is critical. Actions are scarce enough that attending to one battle will leave several unaccounted for. While the cat's away...

My biggest problem with the game is the randomness, both in regional issues and in the opinion polls. Parties have only limited ability to change platform and some will be more naturally aligned with important regions than others. Opinion polls are auctioned off blind before each election and can increase or decrease party popularity [i]multipliers[/i] by as much as -3x or +4x -- a swing of plus or minus 20 votes, from a total of 50, is huge. But for each poll card, each bracket (+3, +2, +1, -1, -2) applies to a named party. If you win the card that can sends Die Linke up +3 and the SPD -2, that's great if you're Die Linke and want to move up -- not so good if you're the SPD and want the same thing.

These elements are arguably thematic and do ratchet up the tension, but it's all a dice roll too far for a 4-5 hour game.

I enjoy Die Macher as an experience game but I understand why most people say they like to play it once a year.

RATING: N/A
[Moskito Spiel 2nd Edition] {German politic, economic; blind-bidding, bidding, variable-player-order, area-control} Die Macher is a very heavy game.  Players need a very good long-term planning to win.  Player interaction is very good in either cooperative (coalition) or competitive (getting media controls, etc.).  Replayability is very good - each game is different.  I am happy to own this game.

However, it is not easy to teach this game effectively without a round of sample play.  And, it needs some time to understand the game; esp. to understand the use of shadow cabinet and opinion pool cards.

The game component is effectively.  The German cards don't interfere the game play much.  It needs a large table space.

Well I finally have played this and I denounce those people that call the the best EURO game.  It extremely luck driven given it's 5 hour play time. The op polls are ridiculously powerful. It's possible to be dealt an impossible position from the very start.  It is very fiddly.  I love the heaviest of heavy games and am not afraid of a good game, but this is not one of them. I'd play only occassionally but certanly would not rate this very high.

This is unarguably a superb game.  It has tons of things going on and there are dozens of different avenues to success.  It's strong both in strategy and in tactics.  Where it fails for me is in the length.  Four hours for a game is just too long for me to want to play it very often.  Many will argue that those four hours are packed solid with gaming goodness and they'd be right but still, it's just too long for my tastes.  I'd still happily play it again if enough people asked me to but I just don't think I'd go out of my way to do it and I don't think the opportunity is likely to come up all that often.

This might rate a 10 if I got to play more but the fact that it is so hard for me to get a game together probably means this will never be a 10 anyway.

A few thoughts:
1.  The rules and gameplay are not as complex or weighty as some would have you fear (I highly recommend the excellent turn by turn player aid here... though you should read through that before playing as you will see things such as the differences that take place for the 7th election.)
2.  You don't need to know any German (again, player aids will solve this problem... plus everything uses symbols.)
3.  The game will fly by if everyone is paying attention - there is very, very little downtime.

If I were forced to get rid of all of my games but one, I think this would be the one I would keep.

5 hours of tension and thinking ahead.  Can German politics be fun?  They sure as hell can be.  Die Macher is a classic and it deserves its status.  I've never seen such an intricate design that requires so much foresight.  It's truly incredible how well the multiple layers intertwine.

I would LOVE to play this again.

Landmark political game with many excellent features. Players take control of a political party in Germany, making decisions that will affect their performance in a series of election. The main route to being successful in the game is matching your party's key issues with the issues of the regions in which the elections are taking place. This isn't always possible however as many of the regions have conflicting key issues, some of which will be at odds with the political parties. The are four ways to score victory points in the game, the main being directly linked to the amount of votes a party receives in each election, but other points are acquired through media control, party membership, and matching their key issues with national issues at the end of the game. 'Die Macher' is unquestionably the best game depicting politics ever made. There are so many interweaving mechanisms at play here, providing players with a wealth of options, and it genuinely feels faithful to its subject matter.

A little long, other than that, absolutely brilliant.

Update:  Raised rating to 9.  This game gets better every time I play it.  There are so many different strategies, that right now, I cannot see how it will ever get boring.  I must admit though, that I look forward to playing a game with all experienced players.  I have never played without a least one new player, and I would like see how long it takes to play with all veterans.

Update:  Raised rating to a 10.  Played with four experienced players.  Total time 3 hr. 5 min. or about 45 min per player (and we took our time).  

This game is an absolutely wonderful blend of long term strategic thinking mixed with quick tactical ploys to take advantage of unplanned situations (or unexpected setbacks).  With opinion polls, bribes and political backstabbing, the theme merges with the mechanics quite well.  Like a real election, you're never quite sure who is going to win until the last vote is counted.

Me and some friends played our first game of Die Macher last night during the Swedish elections :)

We unfortunately had to cut the game short at 01:00 as people had to go to work this morning and the rule reading took much longer than anticipated.

I really liked this game but it was hard to get an overview of all that was going on so the strategies were so so on my part. I did win but that was more luck than skill no doubt.

The one big complaint:
The graphics on the cards are useless in my edition of the game. Some are very hard to distinguish from others and that makes the overview process even more painful.

Final thoughts:
I need to play this game again and to learn it well enough to start strategizing :P
Then I might also bump it up to a 9 :)

7 rounds is slightly too many. I'd really seen everything after 5 and would have been happy to end the game there. It also (the 2 extra rounds) made no difference to our final scores. All that happened was, but that time, people's attention was wandering.

Beyond that, I like a lot about the game; the original selection of issues seemed fairly key as did the luck of the draw in getting suitable replacement issues.

Introducing this behometh can be a stumbling block however I have found referring people to Scott Nicholsons video intro of it has helped significantly.  This is a VERY fun game that I have now played several times and would still love to get it to the table more often, it is just difficult to do due to the time commitment.  It is referred to as a classic and I am glad to have found it.

Great game. A bit...confusing at first. There are a lot of 'moving parts' to it, and it's hard to keep track of them all. But I loved it.  I think the only reason I don't rate it higher is the length.  The game is enough of a 'brain-burner', that 3.5 hours seems like a very long time.

RATING: 6
Interesting how you get VP - in the a round you`re fighting for votes and than depending on the conversion rate for a state you get for your votes VP. 

Don`t like biding for a card, but you don`t know what is on the card.

The turns are very similar and repetitious, so the long game (7 round) is to long.

I hate to say it, but I really like this game.  I seem to be more the typical "Ameritrasher" but this game is just plain good.

Very well designed approach to 'electioneering'. It's an abstracted approach that focuses on the issues and strategies of gaining popular support.

JAN 2009 - Eugene Games Gala - Wow! This is a pretty cool game. Lots of decisions to make/options to consider. Interesting mix of aligning with other people and yet trying to ultimately win out over them at the same time. Many, many possibilities for replayability. 

This game is not for everyone...it's very long and might be a little dry with the political tilt. However, if you like highly complex games with lots of possibilities to mess with other people, this is the game for you.

For me, I very much enjoyed it, but it's not a game I would want to play all the time. Once in a while would be fine.

Le jeu est quand meme assez simple malgré sa longueur. J'ai trouvé qu'il y avait des éléments peu controlable (les cartes qu'on pige, ou on est assis par rapport au leader qui décide du 1er joueur). L'iconographie est simplement affreuse - certaines cartes sont difficiles à différencier.

Je devrai le rejouer quand je serai en meilleur forme (j'avais une sinusite), mais je suis partagé. Un peu long pour ce que c'est.

For a deep strategy game, Die Macher is surprisingly easy to learn.  Although it is long, the time flies by.  Every auction, every decision (of which there are a ton), every move you make affects the future in a meaningful way.  Who knew German politics could be so fun?  This very much deserves its high rating here.

Wonderful. Just one game under my belt but this was just fabulous. Worth all the praise, and I was dead last in our 5-player game - but I know where I screwed up and I intend not repeat my mistake next time. The game lasted 4,5 hours   30 minutes of rules explanation. Amazingly, there is little to none downtime during play.

Edit: In our third game I was completely hosed by with bad opinion card draws: even though I changed my three-card hand thrice, I still didn't get any matching opinions and therefore couldn't change my opinion to match those on the board. And of course the winner's of the elections kept pushing those opinions not available to me to the National Board which caused for me not to get more party members and points. Also the polls are problematic: ok, you can buy the poll to avoid getting hit by the results but what if you roll two zeros after not publishing the result? Then you get completely nothing!

Point being, I think there's too much luck for a game this long and heavy. But I guarantee anyone who doesn't mind luck can enjoy this immensely. And I do too up to a point, Die Macher is certainly technically one of the most impressive games ever designed.

The Best in game design there is around. Schmiel was way ahead of his time. There are games about drawing cards and playing them, there are games about auctioning stuff which'll give you [advantage A through C]. All of which are ok to good in their own way, but this is a game about decision-making and it's dripping with theme and - oddly enough - german politics have never been more interesting than in this game. After some other games it never itches me to become a second Mehdorn (CEO of the DB - german railways), I don't care about being a manufacturer nor does getting in the natural ressources business appeal to me in any way. But after a game of "Die Macher" you really got behind the taste of power. Man, how could it have taken me seven years inbetween sessions of this masterpiece? It's even better than I remembered it to be and by far less complicated than I had in  mind from last time. Well, been through several game rules in the past years...must be the experience.

Summary: The most enriching gaming experience I ever had with really minor luck elements. Calculated risk and decision-making is what I'd rather call it.

Abstract representations of German politics -- so abstract that it has very little sense of politics at all.  (If everyone pours in resources into a single state, it just means that that state has more points to give out, when the results should be zero-sum.)  Graphic design of pieces is poor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Auctions, area majority, negotiating, treachery, cooperative play, press your luck.  This game takes everything, puts it into a blender, and makes a fun, skillfull game out of it.     I personally have a disdain for longers games, but the 0 downtime and the well crafted rules and balance(i.e. this is not a fantasy flight game)  makes this a pleasure to play.  If you are reading this, you owe it to yourself to play this at least once.  I can not promise you will like it, but it is an experience that any "boardgame geek" should have.  

Better than most long games, but I really need to be feeling the mood to play this.  High quality game, that I'd play occasionally.  Its not dynamic enough for the length.  Its a once a year kind of game for me.  An enjoyable time once a year, so for me that is a 6.  I do wish the money stayed tighter throughout the game and not just the first couple turns.

Reprint just arrived from Valley Games, and I'm really looking forward to trying this one out.  Then I can finally decide whether Ra or Die Macher should win the constant struggle between them, heh -- UPDATE: Wow!  This game has everything.  It seems far more daunting than it should because of the number of phases on each turn, but most of the phases are pretty straightforward, and everything ties together so nicely that the time really flies by.  I'm normally not a fan of games with too much luck or chaos, but this one gives you just enough control to make it work. I can't get enough!

This game is one that I want to love.  But the actual play keeps on not living up to my expectations. By the end of the game I think that the winner has been determined by randomness. Well, not quite randomness, but by a confluence of events that were not directly controlled by the players. 

I will play it for sure whenever the opportunity comes up, and I have yet to play a game of it where everyone is comfortable with the rules enough that it is actual play and not teaching...but for now this game takes a couple steps down on my podium of awesomeness.

Finally played this classic and WOW!  Has lots of different mechanics and things going on, but after 1 or 2 elections, you figure it out!  The only downside is the time (4 hours for our 5 players - 2 being new to the game).  I now think I have the mechanics down after a game (yes they are that easy), but figuring out a strategy is totally different (even though I came in 2nd).
Can't wait to play again!

Zambo taught me this at Origins 05.  This is a tough game to rate.  I enjoyed watching the interplay between the issues and the elections.  I was also left feeling that this game could have been done in less time.  I have no idea what I would take out or simplify, though.

The shadow cabinet adds alot of control to the game, that might otherwise be dominated by the luck of the issue draw.  I loved trying to manipulate the contribution cards to try to get the most out of them.  Each election felt like a combination of issues and political manipulation.  This game is far from abstract, but still, it feels like there is more game than there needs to be.  If I am going to spend this long playing a game, I want to feel like I'm doing more than manipulating a system.

I hope I get a chance to try it again.  Our game ran longer than it should have, and my opinion might change considerably when I'm not floundering through the first few turns.

I'm sure that an experienced player would learn to control some of the randomness, but there's still a significant negotiation / predicting-other-player's-intentions element.

As good as everyone says.  Theme is not to my taste, but I still find this a great design.  It breaks my brain, but not in a frustrating way.  There are so many different choices you have to make, and almost every one is bound to make you sweat.  Just when you think you've got the money situation figured out, you realize that your meeting markers are limited, or once you manage to get the opinion poll, your opponent happens to have control of the media and can't be touched.  There's a lot here for you to manage, but none of it is irritating, and it all flows together seamlessly.  The fact that this game was originally released in 1986 boggles my mind.  The design is modern enough that it feels like it could have been released yesterday.

2009-09-20 - I really like this game but it is hard to find players. But when it does come out, boy, is it ever something else! I've never been so enthralled for the whole 4 hours or so that it goes on. It is not a particularly hard game; it is very procedural. Highly recommended.

Enjoyed my initial play of this legendary game.  The player aids on BGG are very useful to follow turn order.   Didn't quite "get all of it" on the rules explanation, but I don't think many would.  Check out the Board Games with Scott tutorial in the few days before you want to play so you will be prepared.  The 5p game I was involved in went a little long, but would play again while fresh in my mind.

Fantastic game.  There is so much going on yet it still feels balanced and engaging.  This is one of those games that to me has a bit of a steep learning curve, it can be overwhelming to a new player BUT it is so worthwhile to learn it.   I can see myself playing this one any time I can talk anyone into it.

Die Macher is a lot like El Grande in that there is little you can completely control- you have to roll with the punches and identify where you can get away with not being undermined. Unlike El Grande in Die Macher there is a lot of room for planning ahead which I find refreshing because it isn't just about the tactical here and now. Luck plays a role but doesn't feel like it decides the game. Although the game clocks in at 4 hours it feels like 2 since players are always engaged thinking about their moves and there is virtually no downtime.

RATING: 5
Remarkably balanced, remarkably challenging, and remarkably deep, this game is perfect for me, as most of the decisions to be made focus on the currently available region.  While there is some planning, the game is primarily reactionary, and I do better at these sorts of games.  The only thing working against it is its length of play.

I have played this game a half-dozen times now, and it is a very strong experience. I personally prefer the "shorter game" variant described in the Valley Games version of the game, because I don't find that the mid-game suffering overwhelms the benefit of a shorter game. Like Puerto Rico, this game requires a number of pays before you can begin to get a grip on the ways you can effectively mitigate your risk, and like PR, it requires that you play with people of similar experience for best results. I like it with four and five, but there are folks in my group who do not like to play this with anything but five.

Die Macher is one of the most satisfying games in my collection. Granted, the board looks like an aborted Powerpoint sales presentation and the theme seems about as interesting as C-span on a Monday morning. Throw in the atrocious looking clip art cards and I admit, the game looks like a complete train wreck. The cards are an embarrassment and make the game a lot harder than it should be. The shadow government cards also use a weird symbology that completely detracts from the game's atmosphere. I understand the reasoning behind making the game language independent, but realistically all that it does is weaken the whole experience. I'm actually tempted to try and get some custom cards printed, as there are quite a few nice replacement designs floating around here on BGG. The game would certainly benefit from a visual overhaul. 

Don't be fooled though, because despite the aesthetics, Die Macher is a fascinating game. Every turn is filled with so much planning and decision making that the game's four or five hour play time absolutely flies by. Every mechanism in the game is so closely interwoven with each other that I can't imagine ever mastering it. On top of all this wonderful decision making, the game squeezes in some negotiation and temporary alliances...all of which further guide and influence the experience as the game develops.

I want to play this game a hundred more times, I really do. It's that good. I just need to make it less scary looking...

*Finally* played this crazy game.  I thought I'd like it, and...I did.  But no one else did, so it would sit untouched for a decade.  What a beautiful synthesis of disparate mechanisms.  But a bit too much time to invest in such a strange theme, I guess.  And the luck element is disturbingly high for a game this long and involved.

RATING: 7
Not a bad game, but it requires a great deal of micromanagement - the kind of micromanagement that makes you wonder what exactly you were doing when it was all over. Perhaps with more plays it's secrets will be revealed. The big key seems to be when to spend your money, encourage the others to spend loads of theirs and make sure you have a big handfull of cash for the last three auctions - you want to be able to prevent anyone from getting two out of those final three auctions.

I'm still not exactly sure how I won the one game I played.

Impressive political game. 
I call it the Agricola of election games, because it's all about micro-management. You have a lot of control over many different issues and mechanisms.
And it's shorter than most people would have you believe: our first game (with four players) lasted 3.5 hours. Not bad at all!

One word about the Valley Games visuals, though: butt ugly. And, most importantly, very difficult to tell apart. With proper graphics, this game would move even faster. As it stands, we spent way too much time squiting to see exactly what cards were defining the political orientations of every single player (all the way across the table...).

A long game (4 - 4.5 hours). But i'm always surprised that much time has passed ... seems to be much shorter, since you're involved all the time.

There are some interesting things going on in this game (the ability to plan ahead in future elections, for instance), but there is an awful lot of card-based luck in terms of candidate platforms, polls/trends, and card-related scoring.  Also, if you do very poorly in the first election (which is a money election), you're already at a fairly decent disadvantage.  I may play this again, but I may not.

Played once (with 4 players). Definitely an interesting game, with lots of decisions (both on a strategic and a tactic level) and quite a lot of player interaction. Game length is not as much of a problem as I feared (we played a short game in barely more than 2 hours, which would make a full game require about 3 hours at most), but the randomness in the polls might be more of a problem. Still, this is a game I am looking forward to playing again.

Great game. It’s not something I’d play every week because of the time commitment, every once in a while is best. It’s meaty – there are lots of phases to each round, which are all easy to understand individually but harder to comprehend how they work together. After a round or two you get the hang of how it works, but it takes longer to work out what the best tactics are. But even if you don’t know what you’re doing, it’s still really fun because it’s so well themed. Surprising as it may sound, running a German political party is actually very entertaining! You can control the media, manipulate public opinion, accept bribes (or refuse them and take the moral high ground), form coalitions with other players to gang up on another party, it’s quite realistic.

The Facts about Die Macher
Luck - the luck in Die Macher determines how you can win it never determines who will win.  There are numerous way to mitigate and manipulate the luck and a true master would never need to blame poor luck for poor playing.
Learning Curve - You will not be an expert at this game the first time you play it.  It will take several plays to learn all the nuances and manuvers you can use to plan your victory
Length of Play - It will take you a long time to play this when you are learning but with experience this game will play in 3 hours still long but not the ridiculous exagerations of 5 to 6 hours.
If you will accept these things as a given and do what it takes to truely experience this game you will find yourself in the thralls of one of the greatest games ever made
If you cannot accept these things you probably will never like this game.  
It takes a long time to make a great bottle of Wine and you probably won't get it right the first time.  Either you have the determination to do it or you drink wine coolers.

This game is surprisingly awesome.  It is big and impressive to look at.  The play is simpler than it seems at first blush but is still quite intricate and lengthy.  There is so much going on simultaneously that it really creates a challenge.  I am also impressed with how well the theme and mechanics integrate.  That is a very impressive game.  My only concern is that it is hard to get games in considering its relatively great complexity and long play time which can be over four hour in the best of circumstances and easily more than six.

RATING: 10
There is a quality to this game that awes -- yet is hard to put into words.  Its how it meshes so many constantly evolving mechanics together in an effortless way that makes the game play lightly yet keeps your head buried in strategy.  Its a unique feeling that only the better Knizia designs come close to matching. Also, unlike many other designs it has enough hidden information that you can build a hand to a hidden strategy (there is variety in gameplay thats not introduced entirely by random means). About a 3 or 3.5 hour game for us.

First off, this game is long.  Like, you can watch 2 movies and still have time to get in a game of Modern Art long.  But it really doesn't feel as bad as some medium weight games that start pushing the 2 hour mark.  The game itself is amazing.  I've never played anything like it and all the mechanics were elegant.  The one thing that surprised me was the luck element.  Opinion poll cards can mean the difference between gaining 50 VPs on an opponent or staring at a bad die roll and wondering why you bothered bidding on the card in the first place.  The program cards also add to this if you are continually drawing duplicate or useless cards.  The amount of information available seems to cross the line from something to work with in your mind to the inevitable cause of AP, and this can't really be helped in a game like this.  However, it still detracts from the overall experience.  Having said all of that, if you can overlook the above, the rest of the game is phenomenal and well worth the time investment.

(Trade Interest: high) after all these years of not having played this, i finally have, and it does live up to its reputation.  it is definitely the father of modern boardgames.  it has all the tough and varied decision trees, tight player v player situations, symbols over theme, of a modern Euro.  That it is cast as a German election, gives it a mystery, at least to us non-German players.  the mechanics are varied and very good.  thumbs up to this classic.

Very meaty, heavy game ripe with compelling decisions that require advance planning. Lots of strategy, lots of bits, lots of things going on to keep track of.

The theme appears to be incredibly dry on the surface- each player represents a German political party trying to maximize their number of seats in 7 state elections.  Doesn't sound very promising until you sit down and play it.

First, the game feels like the best contemporary Euros being released today - it does not have that dated feel that most 80s games has.  Second, while there are a fair amount of rules for the 10 phases, the mechanics work very smooth and are logical.  Each round is the same so once you get past the first round, it speeds up.  The rules are not fiddly, nor do you have to memorize a bunch of cards or buildings.  While long, there is little down time since each player is involved in each of the 10 phases per round.  Where the game really shines is its combination of tactics and strategy.  Each round, you are vying for seats in the current election so you are manipulating the issues of concern, setting up meetings, and trying to take over the media.  However, you also have information about the next 3 elections although you have less information on the elections further away.  Thus, you have to also be positioning yourself for future elections.  There are meaty decisions every step of the way and balancing your resources are critical.  Do I change my party platform to try to win the next election at the risk of getting more out of step with the overall nation's opinions.  Which elections do I want to focus on and which ones do I want to set up or force a coalition.  I was amazed at how much depth this game has.  I also like the mix of mechanics that include auctions, area control, negotiation, resource management, etc.  

This has taken the #4 slot of my all-time favorite games.

This is a game I have only played four or five times.  I like the ebb and flow strategy aspect of the game.  It does have some down-time, but after a few plays, you can use that time to work out future play.  I might rate it a 7 after another play due to length v playing pleasure.  I would say buy this game only if you are looking for a longer game that has an ebb and flow and rewards thinking ahead.

I feel that the slim possibility (which I've experienced) of getting just flat screwed by not getting any position cards that coincide with the elections or national opinion is unacceptable in a five-hour game.

After 1 Play: Quite a let-down for me.  I didn't think it was nearly as 'heavy' as people say.  There is far too much luck here for a game of this length: Dice rolling, card drawing, investing in areas with a mostly unknown payoff, and being forced to bid on face-down cards of wildly varying usefulness.  Any of these factors (except bidding for face-down cards) would be fine in a shorter game, but I'm not going to invest an entire day into a game only to have my chances shattered by a single card draw.  I think the high rating is due in large part to the legendary status this game acquired while out of print.

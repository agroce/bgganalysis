Good intro to the system. One mapper with some small scenarios supported by series replays to help understand the mechanics.

To my mind the weakest game in the series.  The extra rules to simulate the Chancellorsville Campaign seem cumbersome.  System is great, which is why I still give it a 6.5

My first (and only, so far) GCACW game. Mechanics very quick to pick up, and a game where your troops won't always do what you want them to. I enjoy that sort of thing, and I'd happily play this. Also plays pretty quickly - there's not a lot of waiting around for the other player.

A quality addition to the GCACW family.  Scenarios tend to focus on a very small portion of the map except the very dynamic calvary scenario "Brandy Station".  

The player summary cards (by the designer of Hannibal:CvR no less) are excellent.  Rulebook, counters and most scenarios I'd rate a 7.  Brandy Station and the summary cards are a 10, and justify purchase of the game.

The GCACW series is simply fantastic - very elegant and playable rules, a mile or two per hex, and division level units.  Playing the game just feels like you&#039;re reading a history of the Civil War, even if you are rolling a dice (!) for movement.  Brilliant series of games.

Unbelievable. Only a few pages of rules for a straightforward hex-and-counter game but has a remarkably tense atmosphere. You don't get the feeling you're just pushing counters around. The full campaign here has a more manageable feel compared to the three-map monster of Stonewall in the Valley.

An excellent game, and because it's entirely a one-mapper, the first time I've had the space to play a GCACW campaign.  The basic scenarios are only so-so in my opinion, except for Brandy Station, which is excellent; most of the others are really sort of pushing matches without much maneuver, and generally makes the GCACW scale feel wrong (i.e., this should be a 'battle' rather than 'campaign' scale with more choices).  The full campaign is great, except that I feel that there should be something rather than time (10 turns) that decides victory; I stayed on until the end but it was clear before that the Confederates would have done well to pull back if longer-term considerations were in play.  Still, an excellent game and perhaps my favorite game series.

Like all of the games in the GCACW series this is a good one.  At one time I owned all of the games in the series. I eventually sold all of them because I played them so much, that I got burned out.  All of the games in the series have poorly made counters.  They have a dull finish, and some of them had the information off-centered.  In an effort to approve the appearance, owners will have to clip off the dog-ears, and take a fingernail file to smooth off the sides.  Even this don't improve them too much.  Despite this, I would recommend this game and all in the series.  This is perhaps my second favorite of the series, only behind On To Richmond.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Smaller scale than the previous games in the series, focussing on one battle rather than a campaign, and therefore suffers a lack of replayability. Usual high standards of rulebook and pieces, and the usual gorgeous map.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very tense game and the smaller map makes it easier to get a session going. However, there isn't a lot of grand maneuvering in this one and that is the strong point of the series. Still suffers from this system's cardinal problems: an overly erratic movement system and a horrid CRT.

Re-rated after one trial playing.  I really wanted to like this, but the rules are too fiddly, with too many modifiers.  A unit may need 4(!) counters on the map to represent it (unit, strength/disorg, fatigue, demoralisation.) May revise my appraisal after subsequent playings.  But at this stage, not too impressed.

Not the best iteration of the system - the selection of scenarios is pretty underwhelming (there's nothing in the 3-6 day range, which is my favourite with the system). 
Brandy Station is a nice one - lots of cavalry action.
However, I'm planning to have a go at the Campaign game, which is probably the most manageable of all of those I've seen so far.

This 1996 fifth game in the GCACW Series by AH is a delight to play. The counters and maps are wonderful as is the easy to follow rules. Two army's maneuvering to strike one another makes this an exciting game from start to finish. A great game for learning history, or just having fun.

Rating based on limited solitaire play.

When you read the rules, it seems to be a very random and convuluted system.  But upon playing it a little bit, you find the information is captured on the player aid cards and it plays very smoothly.  As an ACW buff, I find that the randomness in the die rolls and battle results capture the frustrations faced by commanders in getting there troops to move and fight when and where they want them.  I have a feeling that this rating will increase after I get more experience and try the larger scenarios.

Updated after a few more plays.  Excellent game, once you learn the mechanics, it plays very quickly.  Really conveys the ACW theme well.

RATING: 6
Good game system.  However this game of the series suffers from high unit density and a limited area for movement.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
"The die roll is not a function of movement", says the narrow-minded gamer.  Pfft!  Brilliant design-for-effect and history in a box.  Somewhat difficult to get a grasp of the rules, but once the first turn is finished it becomes second-nature.  The newer Standard Series Rules alter (and improve) the artillery use, but the rules are still a bit awkward overall.  A highly-interactive game that plays well using VASSAL w/VOIP, which also handles the high level of counter manipulation.

Kind of a "lite" package.  The campaign is really interesting though, and this is a good scale to explore what was probably Lee's crowning glory.

I own all the games in the series.  This series drags me to a new frontier in wargaming and American Civil War never seen before, even though I am not a Civil War buff originally.

I think the system overall is great. The changes among the different volumes are interesting and make for different challenges in each campaign.

I'd rate this higher, but it suffers from a complexity issue that I have with a number of similar games.  When I play VGCW I can get a good sense of how a battle is going to line up (not the outcome, but the broad brush strokes.)  Maybe it comes with practice, but for this one (and Rise of the Roman Republic) there are too many disparate modifiers on a combat roll for me to feel like I can get that broad picture.

Smaller than RTG and SJW this covers the Battle of Chancellorsville. I remember as the Union player in my first game outflanking Lee's ANV and taking up defensive positions in the Wilderness across his supply lines. How could I lose? Simple my units were crap in combat and Stonewall Jackson just attacked with 2-1 odds at one end and worked his way along the line. I gave up on this system after that.

RATING: 9
The Great Campaigns of the American Civil War series is solid gold in my book. I find the Civil War fascinating, but my main interest is European history. So it isn't just the period covered that makes it great for me. The games in the series are examples of wargames at their finest. The maps are very detailed and look fantastic, and the games are complex enough to give fine detail to the campaigns but not so much that they require huge amounts of time to play. They have a great mix of playability and meatiness. The historical simulation of the battles is excellent. All of these features combine to give players the needed substance to experience how these campaigns played out.

The GCACW series is the best operational games on the Civil War. The alternating nature of individual movements allows for concentrations and reaction to the concentration. The system plays pretty cleanly.
This one is a more static than the other battles. Playing Hooker I watched a wing of my army vaporize - very disconcerting but I was able to win by using the Union corps attacking everywhere where Jackson wasn't

Borrowed this from a friend, and we'll be playing it FtF soon. All this is to help determine how much I want upcoming Battle Above the Clouds, and leap on the reprint bandwagon which is to come after that.

I've solo played the first scenario, and nearly panicked. I'm not much for 'battle' games, and the idea of an operational-level ACW game has always been a strong draw for me. But a bunch of units in direct contact, without any maneuvering to be done? Where was the game I was expecting?

I had to stop and calm down. The first scenario is obviously meant as a way to learn-by-doing the main procedures of the game (and rulebook is extremely procedure-heavy).

Anyway, the solo play went well. Hoping to get a better feel for the 'full' experience of the game soon and give it a real merit-based judgment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A charming and unique treatment of ACW campaign's.  Not perfect and it does appear to require additional rules to provide for the larger intensity battles that most ACW games are based upon.  A far better treatment than the Lee Moves North and Wilderness Campaign forefathers from SPI.

To me, another letdown in the otherwise stellar GCACW series. Even to this day, I'm irritated by Avalon Hill's decision to publish this as a complete standalone game when it could have been a more reasonably priced module for Stonewall Jackson's Way. Why reproduce the same map?

Bought this on a lark after finding an ebay auction in its last couple of minutes.  

After my initial plays of the introductory scenarios, I have a real infatuation for this game.  

The game system is a heck of a lot different than what I'm used to, but I think I can manage.  With the random activation, this is great for solitaire and I really enjoy the departure from the traditional "move some, none or all of your units". 

Having now played Here Come the Rebels, I think this is the perfect introduction to the system, as you can learn the mechanics without having to figure out all of the various complex maneuver strategies.  Wonderful stuff.

01/27/08 - Brandy Station scenario is pretty decent, especially for a 1-turner.  It's definitely helpful (to the Union), however, to ensure the Confederates are playing with the correct Stuart.  Haven't had a chance to check out any of the other scenarios yet.

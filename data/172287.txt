Don't ever become fond with any of your Vikings thay will die. This is the game I was expecting when I played Lords of water deep.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
it feels like a mix of Lords of Waterdeep and Stoneage. The design is not original, complexity is average, playtime is 90-120 minutes. Losing dice in a case of an unlucky roll and "journey" mechanic feel particularly annoying. The artworks is mediocre, fonts are too small and hard to read.

RATING: 8
I'm on the fence. It's a good game but now that we've played it a few times I'm starting to feel like "yes, I've played that and I'm done." However, I'm interested in trying an experiment of adding an extra sea "day" to voyages. It just seems like the sea voyages need to be just a bit more adventurous. So we'll see if this keeps the game on our shelves or lowers it to a 6 which means we probably won't keep it.

Update: the expansions are great! They've kept the game on the shelf and bumped its rating up a notch. No desire now to tweak anything since the expansions offer new options.  Oh, except for one tweak I'd like to try - limiting the number of trolls in the game and if the trolls run out the game ends.

Greeeeat WP game, needs variety in the monsters and more special dice, that seems to be solved in the upcoming expansions.

Edit: Yes, the variety was solved with the expansion, and the Valhalla lets you take more risk and you can acomplish more things

RATING: 6
2 plays / 3,4 players

LIKE: Light game, but nice use of dice as fighters. A few buildings are randomized, so each game can be a tad different. Fun vikings theme, which helps move this game up.
DISLIKE: Rulebook isn't great. The appendix is small type and yet it explains a lot of details about the worker placements. Hidden goal cards create some mystery. The character cards are not balanced, but not a huge issue. Replayability is lacking a bit.

OVERALL: Solid game and killing monsters is fun. Does feel light. Feels *very* similar to Stone Age, but Stone Age is better.

RATING: 7
Very enjoyable gateway Ameri-trash themed worker placement game. With vikings! You collect resources (including vikings represented by dice) and ship out to attack monsters, gaining points. There's not a lot of strategy really, but there is clear conflict between the spots and turn order drives the tension. I really like it and will play it several more times yet because it's very easy to get into. Fun!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really enjoy this game. It is the right mix of worker placement, dice drafting, and action all wrapped in a decent supernatural viking theme. Many I have played it with call it a worthy successor to Lords of Water Deep. While I can see the similarity, I think that there is enough there to make the game pretty different. While you are placing workers to activate actions, like in water deep (and every other game with a worker placement mechanic!) you are also drafting dice to add to your viking warband, food to help on long boat journies to slay monsters, and trying to defent your village from trolls to avoid and assign blame. You are collecting sets and managing resources much more heavily in this game than it initially gets credit for and that makes it more interesting to me than Lords. The art is also just fantastic. A big hit for Greyfox in my opinion.

The consesus in our house is that it is almost as good as Lords of Waterdeep. The luck factor is interestingan can be mitigated by careful planning (even though sometimes things go awfully wrong), we missed the 5-6 players possibility, but that problem is already solved as the kickstarter for the expansions got funded (already backed:) ). It is basically a worker placement with management of the scarce resources, money can be a problem (or the lack of it,as in real life) but an intelligent spot on the board allows for trading goods and money on a one-to-one ratio, really clever in my opinion.

One of my favorites.  I have to say, if I'm going to spend 75 minutes on a game, it might as well be this one.  4 players is the right amount for a full experience, but it plays well with 2 or 3.  It beats out a lot of other generic worker placement games because of the theme.  I'm excited to see how the expansion works with it.  I said from the beginning this game is ripe for an expansion.

A great worker placement game somewhat in the same style as Lords of Waterdeep but with a good amount of luck thrown in with the warrior dice.  Perhaps not in everyone's wheelhouse due to the randomness, but I really enjoy the way everything comes together. I love playing this game.

RATING: 8
 A really thematic working placement game about being a Viking warlord leading your men to victory over trolls, the undead and monsters across the sea. The look of the game in gorgeous and its gameplay is quick and simple but still requires you to put some thought into each placement. You collect your warriors (otherwise known as dice) to take on creatures tormenting towns and villages. And while it does use dice for combat they do not make the game as random as dice in other games. many of the monsters, etc you fight are not terribly tough so they can be defeated with only 1-5 hits. But it is managing the use of those dice so you don't lose them all in every battle that sets up the strategy. In addition you have to manage a small number of resources in order to better your odds of defeating your foes. It's fun, not too long and lends a fair amount of them through the art and game play. The only real downside to this game is that we discovered it after backing Raiders of the North Sea on Kickstarter. Alas Champions of Midgard has a similar theme but is a better game so Raiders will be going on the trade pile still in shrink.

RATING: 6
Excellent visual design. A few elements of the game, such as the variable worker placement buildings seem a little too variable. One game had all free stuff, so there was always something to grab. Another game saw all tiles that charged for stuff. I don't think the variable player powers are effectively balanced. As there is an inevitable comparison to Lords of Waterdeep, I enjoy the blame mechanic from the troll a lot more than I like the mandatory quests.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not the worst but not exactly something I'll want to play again.  Far too random with the dice mechanic, often leaving you to feel like all of the work you did in a round was worthless.  The artwork is great in some places but the text and iconography on the board are incredibly hard to read.  I love worker placement games and this one is certainly low on my list.

RATING: 9
Fans of worker placement titles like Lords of Waterdeep, The Ancient World and Yedo will fit right in with this one, as it features a lot of those same, smooth mechanics for gathering up resources. However, the bonus here is that Champions of Midgard also features a fun, Yahtzee like combat system in which you can score Monster cards by damaging them with successful rolls (or take damage by losing warrior dice from your pool). Great artwork, and I liked that the characters have variable powers, which is something I've always wanted from Waterdeep's factions. I'd say this is a fraction more fun than LoW until you put in the Skullport expansions.

The best worker placement game in my collection. Quick and easy and as a result sees a lot of play. The theme meshes very well with the underlying mechanics unlike Lords of Waterdeep. The expansions are not necessary to the enjoyment of the game, but do add some really cool options.

Probably my family's favorite game. 

The worker placement is intuitive, easy to teach, and very well balanced. You aren't going to win if you don't fight monsters, but there are tons of points modifiers and ways to stay in the game. Seeing dice in a euro style game feels odd, but it strangely fits the theme really well. 

The whole game plays in about an hour, but feels much shorter. This makes Champions perfect for game days where you want to get to multiple games. You won't get tired of this game, or while playing it. I always feel energized and ready for more, even after we've tallied the final score. 

Lots of replay value. While there aren't a whole lot of different characters to choose from, the agency comes in with the number of places you can send your workers. There's always a lot to do, and we always have a blast--win or lose. 

This is an easy 10 for me for accessibility, depth of play, great components, and wonderful pacing.

I know ultimately it is a fairly light worker placement, but it hits such a sweet spot for me.  It really is a lot of fun, and I can't help but love rolling hordes of Vikings dice.  I am really really excited for the expansions coming out to add a bit more variety, but I don't see this one leaving my collection for a long long time.  It's fairly simple, but still offers different strategies, and I have always found it satisfying.  It really hits that sweet spot.

I didn't have a desire to play this game as I saw it used a lot of dice which I normally don't like but it utilized worker placement which I do enjoy.  I was thoroughly impressed with the game.  This game is dripping with theme.  Yes the dice make it very luck driven but it was a lot of fun.  For those who like euro style worker placement but not rolling dice give this a try, I think you'll pleasantly surprised like I was.

RATING: N/A
This is a fantastic straightforward worker placement game. It's less confusing and has fewer moving parts than some others in the same genre, but I think that's a strength. Gameplay is tense, decisions are difficult and (most of the time) meaningful. There is a significant amount of risk in the game, with higher risks offering better rewards (as they should) and likewise you can spend additional actions to mitigate a good deal of that risk.

Additionally, the presence of the troll provides an excellent mechanism for preventing a runaway leader: the apparent leader is forced to take the typically low-scoring troll action in order to avoid taking shame tokens. This seems to pair with requiring first player, as assigning the shame tokens is very powerful, and the troll is frequently the first action selected on any given round.

All in all, excellent experience. I'm really glad I added this to my collection and for me it 100% replaces Lords of Waterdeep. No need to ever play that again now that I have this.

I love the theme and the graphic design. The art looks amazing as well. This is often compared to Stone Age and Lords of Waterdeep. I think this is much better than Stone Age. The options and variability is greater. Also, their are better ways to compensate for bad dice rolls. Comparing to LoW is tougher. I still think the theme is stronger in CoM. Overall, the randomness of the dice rolling during gameplay didn't bother me nearly as much as I thought and I enjoyed the game.

This viking themed worker placement game is fairly similar in feel to Lords of Waterdeep. The dice rolling of the warriors, and fighting the monsters and trolls make the theme really pop and give this game a fun flavor that waterdeep has never come close to for me.

Slightly reminiscent of Lords of Waterdeep, a euro with a distinctly D&D type theme. This one is certainly bigger and heavier but also includes dice for combat - not my favourite mechanism by any means.

As a worker placement euro, though it is tight but with enough alternatives that missing your preferred option is not completely punitive.

Initial Impressions:
-------------------------
A different type of worker placement, where some of your resources are dice.  Enough ways to mitigate bad luck where this still feels like a Euro.  Game moves at a pretty good clip as well.  Fun game for sure, although I do think its a bit overhyped.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The base game by itself is solid and enjoyable, although I can understand why many wouldn't like the 'lose your dice' aspect. With the expansions the game becomes so much better, to the point where I'd say they're essential and make it feel complete. With expansions Champions of Midgard skyrockets up to a 9 out of 10!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Really enjoy this, but I wish it had a bit more variable content.  Hopefully will get it to the table a lot more this year.

After three plays it's beginning to feel a bit repetitive.  New content in variable buildings, characters, boats, and monsters need to be added to increase the enjoyment.

It is a nice worker-placement game, with a part of push your luck with the dice-warriors. I thought i wouldn't like the fact of the luck part, but it fits the gameplay. I like the part och trolls attacking the village and the assign blame, but it can be some rivalry between players by this. 
The quality of the components could be better and the wooden cubes is just so boring. I would like to see meat and wooden figures instead of cubes.
But the game is good and i don't hesitate to play a round.

Fairly light worker placement/set collection affair with a Viking theme. One of the resources you have to claim are warriors in the form of dice. They come in three flavours (white, black and red) representing swords, axes and spears. You use these dice to hunt for food, land creatures or sea monsters.

Other resources are money, wood and food. There's some added fluff in the form of one-shot effect cards, blind end bonus cards, re-roll chips, troll tokens you want to get rid of. The worker placement spots consist of buying cards, boats, starting player, resource conversion and battling monsters. Pretty standard stuff except for the monster spots.

I'm rating it a 6 for now because the die outcome can be prettty devastating. There are various ways to mitigate misfortune, but at the cost of being less efficient. A player that's being bold and is lucky throwing exactly what is needed is hard to keep up with. Also, the distribution of monster types for set collection can turn sour. The same goes for journey cards.

It's a fun game to play though, but the time invested versus luck is not entirely to my taste. Would play again, but not something I need in my collection. I'll take Stone Age anytime if I'm in the mood for worker placement, dice rolling and set collection.

Great worker placement with awesome theme.  I have Raiders of the North Sea also, but love the dice.  They add the element of chance, but in a fun way.

This is getting a lot of great buzz as a Lords of Waterdeep replacement.  It looks like a great game, has really great art and fantastic components.  The game is doing something right, so for those reasons I'm rating it at the same level as Lords of Waterdeep and would take it over LoW, honestly.

RATING: 9
Amazing game, not too heavy and gives you good choices to make between preparing for voyages and fighting the monsters that come up each round.  Dice add a good bit of randomness that helps make it more thematic, and man does the theme come through in the game, was talking like a viking by the end.  The different abilities on each of the characters helps make each person unique and does affect decisions in the game.  Very much a keeper.

This is a very fun worker placement/combat game. This game borrows heavily from Lords of Waterdeep in many of its mechanics and uses dice combat to create more variety. I feel like Lords of Waterdeep does a better job of what this game tries to do, but if you love rolling dice and want a better theme than Lords of Waterdeep you may enjoy this one more. It's a very cool viking theme and the artwork is fantastic. The board is gorgeous and the gameplay is very fun and with 4 people can be tense as the board fills up very quickly. Overall one of the better games of 2015 and one that will stay in my collection for sure.

Solid worker placement game that feels very similar to Lords of Waterdeep with a cool Viking theme. The artwork is very pretty and the gameplay is very simple to understand even if one has never played a worker placement game before. I like the different warrior dice you can obtain for a bit of variety in combat and strategy in addition to the special powers by each character. The board organization is my biggest complaint as I feel it is a bit counter-intuitive to resolve some of the combats from right to left but that's a minor gripe. The expansions are also interesting as they add a bit of weight but also some interesting mechanisms like the Valhalla where you can redeem chits from fallen warriors to gain special abilities. A bit lighter than my favorite worker placement games but a solid offering in the genre anyway.

Excellent worker placement game.  Hits that Lords of Waterdeep accessible light worker placement but doesn't include annoying quests and instead lets you kill stuff with dice.  Win/win.

Bogs down with 4 or 5 players. Actually, I have yet to play a game of this that didn't feel 20 minutes too long. A dice-chucking game should be frenetic and exciting-- particularly one about berserker Nordic monster hunting. This game may yet offer that experience, but I haven't found it yet.

I enjoyed this game for what it is, which is a fighting game where you don't fight the other players but monsters in the game. It is a fun system, with racing for the troll, gathering special powers, limited actions etc. I had A LOT more fun with this than Blood Rage, which I thought was tortured and obvious. Should play in 60 minutes tops with players who know it, which is where this should be.

RATING: 8
Nice game, but the Troll/Blame mechanic is SUPER annoying for two players. If you are looking for a gateway dice game, go for Stone Age! If you want the whole "doing quests and converting goods to victory points" go for Lords of Waterdeep. If you have both and want Vikings, go for Champions of Midgard. The announced Expansion might change my thoughts about the game.

This reminds me of Lords of Waterdeep but with more random elements. Lots of dice rolling and unveiling a random event when fighting.

The expansions seem like a must have for variety, especially Valhalla.

The game has enjoyable moments, but dice rolls are really swingy.  Dice always can be, but they are even more than usual in this game.  Add to that the randomness factor for the travel cards (with the boats) and you have a super random game.  Once you get past that, you can have a quick (yeah the game is quick) fun experience with friends.  And then you lose 3 turns worth of ressources collecting because of god awful rolls while your opponent pushed his luck and managed 3 kills with super low dice.  

All part of the game you would say, well it is.  That's kind of the point.  Chucking dice battling monsters hoping for the best seems fun to you, get this game.  I would play again, but would not strategize too much, not a game for that.

And if comparisons are necessary, Lords of Waterdeep is a whole lot better than this one.

No surprise that I love this game, given its similarity to the superb "Lords of Waterdeep." I particularly love CoM for its "blame" system, whereby somebody needs to defeat a troll to keep all players from receiving a point-sapping blame token. Via this mechanic, you actually have reason to potentially root for another player to do well. Sure, that player has the right to assign one blame token to any other player he chooses if he wins, but hey, maybe he won't choose you, and you'd have gotten the blame token anyway if he lost. So yeah, go other player! That's a neat little mechanic in a game filled with them. A definite winner.

The easiest way I can explain this game is, Lords of Waterdeep but better. It's a worker placement game, around the theme of Viking warriors fighting monsters and trolls and trying to gather enough renown to become the new Jarl.

The resources you gather are then used for these tasks. Warriors are used to fight and food is used to feed your warriors as they sail off to fight monsters. Wood is gathered and money used to buy and trade resources.

Rather than gathering a bunch of cubes and swapping them for points, as per Lords, in this you have to roll the dice and battle to get the points.

Do you mount an expedition? Harder but better rewards. Do you fight the troll? If nobody does, the villagers won't like you. Or do you hunt the undead? Easier than monsters, but less rewards.

All the actions you take make sense, tied together in a way that Lords doesn't.

Played once after hearing this was similar to Lords of Waterdeep which I really enjoy. To me this game did not provide many meaningful choices particularly at 4 players as the main resource, warrior dice, were often selected early, so you would end up having to pay for them through burning through more workers. The wood, food, and gold did not seem to have much useful purpose in the game making it feel quite one dimensional. I really enjoy the idea of adding dice to a worker placement game but for me this one fell a bit flat.

RATING: 7.9
Purchased in Essen after liking what I saw. Was very much biased positively following several reviews and game plays I had seen.

So far done 3 player games. The game moves along at a nice pace and the fighting mechanism is quite entertaining. Nice interaction in the race for some of the worker spots and nice PvP aspect with the blame tokens. Still have to find which viking leader I like most. They are quite nice with their unique abilities. Overall I like the viking theme - it's consistently applied throughout the game and the mechanisms make good sense.

I hope it will scale well to fewer players.

One peeve however: board and cards have a strong tendency for wrapping. Not so nice. The illustrations are very nice.

RATING: 7
Champions of Midgard is a game of very interesting concept, mixing standard euro worker placement mechanics with quite random monster fighting where a lot of dice are rolled. Therefore it's not only about optimizing the best moves possible but also risk management. 

Rules are very simple and easy to grasp. Places where you can send your workers are rather typical - gain resources, trade etc. You can also take a spot for fighting enemies and after all workers are placed, players begin to assign their warriors(which are divided into three types that differ a little bit - I like that aspect, those with axes can deal huge amounts of damage but cannot defend themselves too much, while swordsmen are weaker but have a chance to block some hits) and make attempt to defeat all these creatures. Combat is random - you may stomp your enemy in just one turn and lose nothing, or you can roll absolute trash and giant troll will kill all your precious warriors! Of course there are possibilites to reroll, but generally it can make a serious euro-gamer a little bit frustrated. Nevertheless, this is really a lighter game that's about just having fun and not calculating everything. 

The game is quite thematic and feels a bit adventurous. For example, you may send your warriors into the vast sea where they travel on their boat to meet some mythological monsters(which are quite stronger than those just near the village). Not only you have to feed them(using a previously gained resource - food) but also you may encounter some disastrous events like storms! Sometimes the weather is good, nothing harmful happens, but another time you have to fight Kraken before you get to the monster - so it may end up in a way that your amount of warriors will decrease and you will be weakened before the actual fight. But you could visit an oracle before to check what future has prepared for you...

Overall, pretty fun game. Not sure on the replayability as monsters seem to be quite similar and worker placement spots barely change(only four of them are different each game and they don't differ THAT much), but definitely looking forward to play again as it is fun, light and quick hybrid.

This is easily one of my favorite games to play.  I love the Viking theme, the dice rolling combat, the variety of choices, and the fact that this game can be played in roughly 1 hour.  I have always enjoyed playing, even during games where I got destroyed by luck and ended up losing quite harshly.  The artwork is awesome, the unique player powers available help mix things up a bit, and the expansions add much more options so you won't feel like you are "stuck" with not much to choose from.  It's a bit "heavy" to teach to anyone not familiar with worker placement games, but otherwise isn't too bad.  I enjoy this as a 2 player game, and the tension increases with 3 or 4 players.

Excellent thematic game.
It has simple mechanics and the rulebook is solid.

A different perspective than simple Worker Placements like Lords of Waterdeep, the turns go quickly and battles with dice are exciting.

While it has some RNG in it, the game provides counter-RNG tokens. While I don't like too much dice rolling and bad luck I didn't feel bad when it did unlike other games.

If you like simple Worker Placement & a bit of dice rolling with a solid theme then this is a great game.

A fun little worker placement/push your luck game. It plays fast enough that frustrations over poor dice rolls can be ignored. I would say, however, that the game needs something. I'm not sure what, maybe a lasting engine that you can build up over the course of the game, rather than just the single special ability your character card gives you. I'm hoping the expansion will help with our dissatisfaction with parts of this game.

Fun worker placement, fighting monsters, assigning blame the townsfolk will believe, and it needs to be played with the valhalla Expansion, otherwise it's really hard to let go of your fighters.

  Ive used this as my intro to worker placement for a buddy. I probably have this ranked above "better" WP but I have fun and love playing COM. Cartoon-ish type Viking theme. Biggest complaint Ive seen about this is the dice. I LOVE the dice combat. Thematic in that sometimes you have it all played out and things dont go your way, other times you score an unexpected upset. I like the event cards when sailing to battle. As in life you try to mitigate things but in the end sometimes Kraken's strike. Everything looks good and even better with my token updgrades. Pretty quick playing basic WP w/fun theme.

RATING: 8
Provisional rating after one play.

The art direction of this game is gorgeous.  I especially loved the card backs and the monster art.  It's a shame the meeples weren't themed, but that could be easily pimped out.

Anyways, the game is a mix of worker placement and gambling/luck, which gives the standard Euro formula a nice injection of Ameritrash.  Guess you could call this a hybrid.

The standard fare is placing your workers as normal, but while there are some resources like gold and food, the focus of the game will be on collecting your Vikings, who take the form of dice.  It's here where luck plays a role as you assign your Vikings to one of three areas to battle mythical monsters from Viking lore.  The main baddies are the trolls, followed by draugrs.  To fight the really fantastic stuff, you have to send your champions over the sea in longships and if they're lucky enough to survive the journey, then they can fight all kinds of things with unpronounceable names.

What I found most entertaining was that the dice seemed fair.  Yes, you can get unlucky, but for the most part, we didn't have any issues defeating our foes and losing dice to the creatures wasn't nearly as brutal as, say, X-Com.  Your chances of rolling some kind of positive result is always over 50/50 so it never felt like the game was cheating.

If I'm going to play a worker placement game, this seems to be the one I might enjoy most.  Time will tell.

Champions of Midgard is a medium-light weight worker placement game with a mythical Viking setting.  Players use their workers to visit locations in town to either collect resources and/or different types of warriors (represented by different dice with customized faces).  These resources and warriors then depart on quests to slay mythical Norse monsters such as Wyrms, Fenrir Cubs, Draugrs, and Trolls.  Monsters have different point values and rewards and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

Players can choose from different leader characters which provide unique powers (although the powers are not well balanced).  There are hidden scoring options as well as set collection bonuses from the different monsters slayed.  Combat is resolved by rolling the warrior die, so there is definitely an element of luck here.  

This game is often compared to Lords of Waterdeep.  Although they are somewhat similar, they definitely will attract different crowds.  Players who care less about theme and want less luck will be drawn to LoW, while players who like to roll dice and enjoy a better incorporated theme may prefer CoM.  I happen to have room in my collection for both.  I  highly recommend this one!

Only played one 2P game and would like to play at a higher player count before assigning a final rating. Overall, it's a hybrid Eurothrash game and a nice change of pace from straight Euros. There's definitely some randomness with the dice, but ways to mitigate that are provided. Would be a good choice to introduce a Ameritrhash gamer to Euro mechanics.

Simply horrible game. Virtually no redeeming characteristics to this game. The only reason it gets a 2 instead of a 1 is because it is still a game, just a horrible and pointless one. Thanks for the Dribble.

Lots of randomness, very limited actions and other players can directly attack you.

Honestly I had to quit halfway through the game. Normally, I can stomach even bad games to the completion, but after 4 turns I had been attacked 3 times, accruing more negative points then the other players had points among them. Every attack I had sent had failed without any benefit.

It's to long to really justify it as a "Light" game. I like King of Tokyo for instance. But it isn't as random, long or unfair. (At least the attacks are somewhat structured).

RATING: 7
Light, easy to learn/teach.  Good mix of worker placement and controlled random factors (dice rolling).  Very similar to Lords of Waterdeep, as others have mentioned, but less polished and concise.  The downside is the focus on the worker placement portion minimizes the epic theme of being a viking and sailing to far away lands to win glory killing mythical monsters.
Places to improve:
- Depth of hero and monsters.  Maybe the hero should get his/her own dice for permanent use?
- Breadth of resources and uses
- Usefulness of locations (many of the same slots go unused on many of the turns)
There is not a huge amount of variation to the way turns are taken and play can feel a little dry/linear.

RATING: 7
A good game that mixes worker placement and dice elements.  The dice elements can be fickle, but with 4 players it tends not to drag the game down.  The random elements are mitigated by the type of dice you use and re-roll tokens.

You take the above, then add a theme that works, and you have a pretty good four player game.

For us, this easily replaced Lords of Waterdeep as a quick, light, and accessible worker placement game.

I do not recommend with 2 or 3.

I enjoy medium weight Worker Placement games, but the need to roll and hope you kill the monster before your people die, as well as the possibility that you lose people on random card placement mean this the bottom of the pile in this category.

Initially the description of this as [thing=110327][/thing] but with a theme put me off playing, but the b/f persistend and actually I really enjoyed this. 

It is a worker placement although that is only the first part of your turn as you have Vikings (dice) which undertake battles for you. You are looking to collect sets (enemies mostly have a colour) and to fulfil destinies (hidden objectives).

I can see why it is described as similar to lords of water deep but here I actually felt like I was doing something, battling monsters, saving my little Viking village, whereas lords of water deep is fairly themeless gameplaywise.

RATING: 7
Lovely art and a very clear game to understand and play! A lot of the worker placement stuff feels similar to a lot of other WP games and it might be a little too straight-ahead to garner any points for innovation. Almost feels like a semi Ameritrash as you purchase dice-as-warriors to go out and do battles with monsters. There's not too much to mitigate the luck of the roll (other than the precious and limited ability to re-roll) so you can get major screwed on rolls and that's not a great feeling.  Although the WP aspect feels a bit mundane at points, there is just enough variety that is neatly worked into the game to make me feel like this is a solidly designed game.  Beyond the WP, it has secret goal objectives and "rune" powers which all work nicely in the game to give it some interest. I don't think this is a game I'd pick up as it doesn't really replace or ascend any other WP games I have, but I can't think of anything actually negative to say about this game.  It knows what it wants to do and it does it well, even if there is a little too much luck in the dice for my liking.

The first Euro/Ameri-Thrash hybrid that I've really enjoyed.  The dice combat is fun and works well!  There are a lot of actions to take and, even with four players, there's usually a good action to take (although there can be a useless final worker in the final round of the game with four players since not every spot might get you victory points).  Great art, fun theme.  

On a side note, this game bears no resemblance to Lords of Waterdeep at all, although a lot of people say so.  It's closer to Stone Age if you're looking for a comparison.

Purchased this game at GenCon 2015. We played it once with three people. I found myself getting a little uninterested toward the end of the game. Then I tried the game again with four players and found it to be a much better game. There was more strategic thinking in order to get the resources you need. I felt more engaged because I had to focus and adjust my plan based on other players' moves.  I will definitely play this game again. There is still more strategy I need to figure out.

Dropped this rating upon a second play. For the second straight time, a player tried to go fight a monster and failed, either due to lost resources due to the journey card, or the inability to re-roll due to glory tokens. Either way, when that happens you are immediately out of the game, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. I really dislike that about this game and Valhalla helps, but doesn’t alleviate this issue.

The Viking theme and addition of dice combat to worker placement is just fantastic.  This completely replaces Lords of Waterdeep for me.

A tolerable and pedestrian worker-placement game, except...
A game this tepid doesn't deserve so much passion, but allow me to vent some spleen here. This game has two massive problems.
First and foremost, the kingmaking potential and arbitrary nature of the grotesquely stupid "choose a player to lose points" nonsense is beyond bad. It seems like a ham-handed attempt at introducing player interaction, but it's so clumsy and gratuitous that it helps change a forgettable one into an irritating one.
Second, and this is more personal, this has to be one of the worst examples of a wasted theme in a long time. I mean, come on--Norse mythology allows you to do so much. Where are the gods, the fatalism, the end of the world, the big name monsters? The only famous monster referenced is via a strange "Fenris Cub" monster type.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The die rolling elements are the best and worst part of this game. It definitely adds a level of randomness which sucks when the dice aren't going your way, but also can allow for some epic late comebacks if you have the guts to try some very aggressive plays. Solid worker placement game.

Light worker placement with push your luck when you fight the monsters with your dice. Reminds me of Stone Age but I like the theme more.

Highly enjoyable light worker placement game that adds in nice elements of randomized setup via building tiles and dice-based combat that has risk involved, but also allows for quite a bit of mitigations. All-around pleasant to play and the artwork on the different monster cards is great.

Like the simple worker placement this game brings, and the idea of fighting and questing that is missing from most euros.  With quick players this game is not overlong.  You must watch the combats to make sure you don't lose.  That's going to put you behind early if you make bad decisions.

Feels Thematic. Combats and expeditions have an ameritrash element (hidden event + roll the dice for combat) that introduce a push your luck element to the game.  Imagine a worker placement with the typical resource gathering except that when you want to convert your resources to VP, you have to roll the dice to see if it succeeds.  If not, well, you've just lost your resources.  Too long for the amount of luck involved.

Worker placement AND dice combat?! Where do I sign on the scroll?

UPDATE:
After a few games, I've reached a point where this perfect peanut butter and chocolate mechanics concoction surmises unforeseen rage in me while playing. Maybe that's the point. Maybe it needs to be tight and difficult and cutthroat. Maybe it's me getting TOO into the theme. All I know is, I'm no longer digging this AS much as I initially did because I do not like being angry with others; at others while playing. This is unfortunate because Champions of Midgard is an amazingly produced game. I'll always recommend it to anyone that likes worker placement, dice combat and/or Viking themes...just maybe not with me?

Still prefer Lords of Waterdeep, not that they have to always be compared. The dice mechanic is great, the other parts, like the way the the resources interact and rely on each other, doesn't feel quite as smooth. The troll/blame mechanic interesting but if you're the type who wants to run a "perfect" ship, it's going to drive you nuts. 

+Colorful, if a bit messy, artwork
+Dice mechanic adds some risk
-Probably too many overlapping mechanics
-Always going to be compared to LoW

Keep in mind, at the time of writing this review, all my plays of this game were base sans expansions. Cannot comment on how the expansions add/change/improve the base. So as is, Champions of Midgard is a solid Worker Placement game with a thinly veiled viking theme. Enjoyed it for what it was but after 4 plays, I was aware that obvious strategies become apparent quite easily and early. However the dice-rolling can of course keep these from plaguing every game with a luck element. But if you have a player hoarding all the dice, you're in for some trouble. Also failing to fight the troll enough times, can really punish you with those "demerits"(sorry forget what they are called in-game), which in-turn translate to negative victory points at the end of the game. 

I don't see the parallels to Lords of Waterdeep like many others do. LoW has a bit more strategic depth, compounded even more with the expansion. Grant LoW is the easier game, but that doesn't necessarily mean it is "weaker." Champions of Midgard loses it's luster after a few plays. I love having games with meat on them and replayability is a huge factor for me in keeping a game in my collection, sadly this one lacks a bit in both areas. The one thing that will remove a game from my collection is lack of variability game to a game. At the time of this writing, it didn't seem there was any expansion content on the horizon, which really affected its shelf life. I played Lords of Waterdeep over 15 times, with only the base game(no expansions) and still have a great time game to game. Champions sadly got a bit stale after my 5th play of it. 

The game is really good, with sound mechanics and a good amount of "mitigate-able" luck thrown in, but lacks in variability and unique choices game to game. 

Update: Expansions have been announced for this game finally, and seem to correct all the issues I had with the base game. Dark Mountains add more stuff, which what I wanted most, but Valhalla completely makes the base game different in interesting and fun ways. Time will tell how they hold up and how "essential" they will be to fully enjoy the game, which for me feel "essential" right out of the gate. Thankfully both are priced well, and don't see why you shouldn't pick both up with the base game. Hoping I can reacquire the game, and its expansions, soon, which in turn will possibly make it rank higher. But for just the base
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As far as worker placement games go, this is my favorite.  There are multiple ways to win.  There is a lot of interaction between players, trying to get to certain stalls before others.  It lacks a little in higher strategy, but the fun of rolling the dice and killing monsters makes up for it.  Very fun game.

I understand the rationale behind calling this Stone Age meets Lords of Waterdeep. Unfortunately, this is one of the cases where the whole doesn't equal the sum of the parts.  I want to like it.  The theme works for me, the general idea of Vikings fighting for glory, etc.  But the mechanics just don't blend as well as either of the aforementioned games.

Worker placement games have emerged as my favorites generally. I also enjoy chucking dice. This game is a beautiful hybrid of Euro worker placement and Ameritrash. The dice combat is satisfying and fun, due to plenty of luck mitigation. I also enjoy the variable player powers. Cool art, fun player interaction and satisfying choices.

RATING: 7.5
I thought that making climatic worker placement game is impossible, but here it is!
At it's roots Champions of Midgaard is simple worker placement, with some random buildings, hidden goals and some dice rolling. But at the same time I find it very climatic and fitting to Viking theme.
Think about it as Lords of Waterdeep, but with fitting theme you can feel in the game.

RATING: 8
 Light weight worker placement with a great theme.  The mechanisms all make sense with the Viking theme and do a good job of giving your actions purpose.  There are plenty of options, so wasted turns are rare and the game moves at a good clip. It definitely plays better with more than two players... I think 4 may be best.
  The expansions make it better in all the right ways without adding a lot of time.

RATING: 7
Definitely entertaining game. Easy to teach, quick and good thematic worker placement with a dice driven combat (my reason for buy). 

Negatives: Only 5 playable characters, with very questionable special abilities (balance). Limited content overall (need more variability) and I had couple of bad dice (missing paint on some sides) in the box (2nd edition).

Would score more with more content in the basegame (expansion coming in 2017)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played with Valhalla and Dark Mountains at least, maybe some others. Certainly entertaining game, but ran bit long for the weight. First game about 3,5h including setup and rules explanation, second game maybe 2h 15min, which is still a bit too much. Theme also about as good as in Feast of Odin, ie. some pictures and actions to a degree make sense, but that's about it.

My incursion into worker placement (WP) territory, and man what an incursion it was!! Really nice game, easy to pick up and plenty of decision to make. En este juego uno es un héroe vikingo con la misión de proteger una villa de desamparados aldeanos medievales. En clave fantástica porque uno los defiende contra trolls, dragur (zombies nórdicos) y otros montruos. Durante el turno uno escoge acciones y beneficios que no todos pueden escoger; el jugador debe considerar cuáles son las mejores acciones para adquirir mas puntos de victoria. Muy divertido!

Fun theme with too much randomness and no real strategy in it. Resource management has no point when all dices fail. Your strategy is collapsed if you couldnt draw the right scoring card.

A copy of waterdeep even with less strategy and so much luck that i dont understand why they copy of waterdeep and worker placement. Even it doesn't serve theme.

Juego sencillo basado en colocación de trabajadores en el que representamos a una tribu de guerreros nórdicos. Sobre un tablero central los jugadores por orden de turno irán colocando a sus trabajadores acompañándolos si el sitio lo requiere de guerreros representados por dados. Estos guerreros podrán ser de diferentes tipos, dados blancos/negros/rojos, teniendo estos dados diferentes resultados en sus caras, más o menos daños, escudos para evitar impactos o nada.

Además de las típicas localizaciones para conseguir recursos que luego cambiaremos por guerreros, obtención de "misiones" que al final de la partida nos darán puntos, podemos combatir una serie de monstruos que si vencemos nos darán puntos. 

El combate es simple, Tirar los guerreros que hemos mandado a pelear intentando igualar o superar la defensa del "bicho". Este a su vez tiene un ataque que serán guerreros perdidos a no ser que saquemos escudos en la tirada.

Cada jugador empieza con un jefe de la tribu que le da un a ventaja al tirar dados de combate, al realizar una acción de mercado, si obtiene un determinado número de éxitos peleando etc ...

Bueno, si se juega rapidillo puede ser una opción como juego de una hora de relleno

Worker placement. When I heard there was combat, I was concerned, because I don't really like PvP. But the combat is against enemies on the board (monsters and such). The only real PvP element is when you hand out a shame tokens after defeating the Troll. There are three kinds of dice that you can collect representing different kinds of combatants. Unlike most games in which you collect dice, the dice are easy to lose--you almost collect and spend them like any other resource. It's not quite like that, but I quickly learned to not get too attached to my dice. There's more where that came from. Fun experience. I won my first game, so that probably skews my opinion.

Very good Viking themed euro. A little heavy on the point salad for me and I didn't really see much engine building here - more tactical round-to-round decisions than grand strategy.

That being said, it was FUN. The Norse theme really shines through and I really liked the dice combat system - it reminds me much of the combat system used in Villainous Vikings (which is awesome in my unbiased opinion.)

Very good worker placement with a viking theme where you defend your home turf from monsters and sail out to take on even bigger game for more points. Variable powers depending on who you pick as your viking and being able to gain extra scoring conditions are very neat mechanics.

Dice during combat can sort of be mitigated using favor tokens but that bit of randomness can sometimes screw you over pretty hard.

RATING: 7
Players are wanna-be champions trying to protect their villages from trolls, draugrs, and monsters and in so doing collect enough glory to be crowned THE Champion of Midgard. Players start with 3 workers and draft actions from roughly 20+ action spaces, one of which enables you to purchase a 4th worker. The distinguishing feature of this game is that you collect not only basic resources like wood, food and coin, but you also collect three kinds of warriors - swordsmen, spearmen, and axemen which are dice. You assign the dice to combat actions in order to defeat the various creatures to gain points and other rewards. While this seemingly adds a very chancy element to the worker placement format, you can manage your odds pretty well so that outcomes are rarely much out of keeping with what you expect. The dice are simply the "advanced resource" you need to convert creatures to points. While you can assign dice to fight trolls and draugrs directly, monsters (which are worth more points) require an uncertain sea journey to reach, so they are a bigger investment with bigger risks and rewards. The usual special action and end-game bonus cards are also available.

With so many action spaces there isn't really enough jockeying for position and blocking. I was concerned I'd have more of an issue with the dice but they are not the problem. This makes the game more race-like than strategic and why I like it slightly less than the other games with which it competes.

I believe everyone (that enjoys the mechanic) finds a worker placement game that is their favorite and there isn't always a mechanical or measurable reason for it. At least part of my love for this game is the theme, and the enthusiasm of people I've played with for the ability to become Viking war leaders and raising up armies. The dice aspect, while it can sometimes ruin a game for a player (fixed in the Valhalla expansion), make it approachable for new players, as my experience playing alone can't win me the game and allows them a chance for victory in battle. There is also an awesome feeling of rolling a giant pile of different colored dice to slay a monster. We play with the Skyrim soundtrack playing for a great atmosphere. A great game.

這是一款背景很尋常，抵禦外敵入侵的遊戲，在古代的維京世界，能力強大的領袖過世了，周遭的怪物開始成群的侵犯，玩家需要扮演領導者，集結各勇士抵禦外敵~
遊戲用骰子當作勇士來判定對怪物的傷害，用米寶工人放置來取得想要的資源，供人放置的機制很像"深水城領主"，每回合有不同的怪物侵犯，山中的巨魔及食屍鬼可以在領地周遭防禦，海中的怪物必須搭船遠渡抵禦，航行有天氣風險，糧食及士兵都必須準備充足，好處是擊敗海中怪物的分數極高~
遊戲並沒有很特別的機制，流暢的搭配及美術卻令人激賞，工人放置糾結以及骰子的不確定性在這個遊戲扮演舉足輕重的地位，可變的玩家能力似乎儼然成為各項遊戲效法的特色，如果喜歡"深水城"的玩家，我相信一定會更喜歡這款遊戲~~

Very fun game! Simple enough to teach new players easily and they can perform well quickly. Decent amount of strategy and plenty of tactical decisions for a light game. It doesn’t feel perfectly balanced but it doesn’t need to because it creates a good tension trying to decide whether you can live with your slot in turn order or take the first player marker for next turn. Some people may not like the randomness of the dice and admittedly it got a bit stale when my rolls were going bad, but that randomness drives a lot of excitement when some either rolls amazingly poorly or comes up really clutch.

Excellent worker placement game! On par with Stone Age and Lords of Waterdeep, but with some dice rolling/killing action thrown in. Unfortunately, the font is difficult to read, print is small, and the boards all came a bit warped. Minus a half point or so for poor production and font choices, but the game design is very fun. Just be prepared for some swingy luck, but most of it can be mitigated. Looking forward to playing this again - and would even suggest it.

Played once as a 2-player game on Tabletopia. I had hoped the warrior dice had more variety, which would add a lot more interesting strategy with them. But 2 of the 3 are pretty much identical. 

Additionally, the dice were very swingy, and disappointing. The luck of the dice can easily determine the winner. I'd recommend it to lots of people, and would consider having it myself, but it hasn't held up to the hype for me.

I find this to be just a head-banging, dice-chucking great time where you're fighting monsters and trolls and sending vikings to their glorious deaths, earning gold and favor and glory along the way.  But a good bit of planning should go into your strategy, as fights can be costly and forces can quickly be depleted.  Plan for more food than you need and more warriors than you need so that some can be lost along the way to victory against those far away Monsters.  I greatly enjoy it.

It was really fun venturing out to sea, hoping you had enough food on board, and fighting monsters. Re-roll tokens curb randomness and keep the game very decision-based.

I only played Champions of Midgard once, with Valhalla and The Dark Mountains.  Very good.  To play without Valhalla would seem incomplete and inferior to me; they make a whole other layer to the game -- wanting to arrange for certain combos of your warriors (dice) to die to get certain bonus cards -- with almost no extra rule complexity.

RATING: 4.5
Worker placement with output randomness during 90 minutes? And this is not the only problem with this game. Huge swings of luck (you get 12 or 0 points based on die roll); despite several ways to make points, you are obligated to use the boats and kill the outside monsters; the game feels very repetitive (get vikings, get resources, fight, spend resources and vikings, repeat); the influence of blame tokens is minimal.

It was quite enjoyable.
Though I lowered my mark as it fills that after one play (even though it was a great one) you already know the winning strategy. A lot of spaces feel as if they are a distraction from the actual game. I would love if more of the spaces had equivalent strategic value thus making you think more about your moves.
Like the fighting mechanic, the different dice add this nice thematic feel.

After so many comparisons to Lords of Waterdeep (my favorite game), I figured Champions of Midgard would simply be LoWd except you have to roll to complete quests instead of simply achieving them once you'd collected enough adventurers and money. In truth, it's more like Stone Age, except that you roll on the step where you spend your resources, not the step where you gather them. Fun game, thematic, and - most importantly - allows for mitigation of bad rolls! Recommended!

This gets compared to Lords of Waterdeep a lot.....and I am not sure why. They are completely different games and has very little in common other than both being worker placement games. The better comparison would be Stone Age, and while I think this is a very good game, I would almost always rather play Stone Age. It is very easy to get hosed with the dice in Champions of Midgard and I have found it to cause frustration in players at times, including myself. I am just not sure if this is a game I need to keep in my collection when I already own Stone Age... and Lords of Waterdeep, I guess. Only time will tell. Update: Good game but sold to someone in my game group to make more room in my library.

This worker placement game is a great substitute for Lords of Waterdeep if you are using it as a gateway for people who love dice and ameritrash. Between the two, I see LoW as the better game for the Euro side and this as a bridge for Video-gamers and Dice Chuckers to experience worker placement. Plus the viking theme is hot right now. Underneath all of that is a really good, if not swingy, game.

Champions of Midgard (formerly Defenders of Nidaros) is a middleweight, Viking-themed, worker placement game with dice rolling in which players are leaders of Viking clans who have traveled to an embattled Viking harbor town to help defend it against the threat of trolls, draugr, and other mythological Norse beasts. By defeating these epic creatures, players gain glory and the favor of the gods. When the game ends, the player who has earned the most glory earns the title of Jarl and is recognized as a champion of Midgard!

This game is what would come out if Stone Age and Raiders of the North Sea had a baby together.  It's a very middle of the road worker placement with nearly zero innovative mechanic.  There are attacks and enemies to beat every round (a la Kingsburg, Troyes, Lancaster), there's classic worker placement, hidden objectives, etc.  Not a bad game but utterly forgettable and feeling a bit dated despite being recent.

this game is absolutely fantastic. It combines some dice rolling combat with worker placement as well as set collecting. The combination of strategy combined with the luck of dice rolling makes the game highly entertaining. Do you take the risk of bringing the bare minimum of food for your men on a quest to slay a dragon  or do you play it safe by adding more food and men but this costs more? Also the secret challenges and quests you can get make for a strategy and reason for moves. To me just excellent and should be much higher in the rankings

Love it! Fun worker placement game with some luck but enough luck mitigation and theme to make the dice rolling fair. 

After the two expansions my rating has moved from and 8 to a 9 I loved this game before and the expansions “fix” some of the issues with the base game.  I put fix in quotes because to me the base game is perfectly awesome and I still recommend getting it without the expansions, but for some the Valhalla expansion helps with some luck mitigation which is a fair assessment.

RATING: 6
I'm rating this a 6 which is lower than what I rate Lords of Waterdeep, but I think that is more because I prefer heavier games than when I first got Lords of Waterdeep, and while maybe I should lower Lords of Waterdeep's rating I got a lot of plays out of it and so have to give it credit for lasting so long as a gateway game that still had enough to keep me engaged.

This game shares many similarities to Lords of Waterdeep, except the method of scoring is more thematic here, at the expense of more luck. Both are fairly simple worker placement games. Both have goals in a variety of forms that require you to convert resources of various forms to complete. Both unfortunately rely on take that as a self-balancing mechanism. Both can go fairly quickly if people spend as much time as they should on the fairly straightforward decisions, but if people dally since each player takes a lot of actions per turn the game can overstay its welcome.

Combat in this game definitely adds theme, and I think it is worth the extra playing time it adds to the game. I especially like the method they did the overseas monsters. It requires 3 forms of resource conversion (fighting dice, food, and possibly gold), yet rather than feeling like you are just jumping through hoops in a soulless efficiency engine it makes thematic sense that you need to get a boat, stock it with food, possibly face hazards on your journey, and then finally fight the monster. However, I wish the monsters were a bit more varied even if that would have made the game a bit more complex, as they didn't feel different enough to me, or enough that I identified them with what they represented in Norse mythology.

I really miss intrigue cards. Besides a couple that mess with the core rules of the game, I liked the hard choice of when to start using them at the expense of having lower priority turn order on your actions. Admittedly, I think CoM has some spots that are more critical for you to go to, and so in that way makes order of what actions you take matter. Also, I miss that you don't stake a claim for what you are going for as you did in Lords of Waterdeep's "quests", as this created a sense of progression as you slowly worked towards something. in CoM, mostly stuff shows up and you fight whatever is most lucrative based on what you already have. I think these aspects might make me like LoW more.

Instead of buildings that can give you more spots there are just some spots that change from game to game. While I liked the owner bonus in LoW, I think having new spots available from the get-go might give more variety.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The dice allow a looser gameplay style than other worker placement games usually offer. Less tactical because you are working with odds rather than using maths to work out the optimal play. Nothing is certain and the best player might not win, which i'm sure will put some people off. I find it to be fun and more approachable for some people. Meaning you can bring it to the table more and people are more willing to play it which might to something to consider. It is not obvious at first but the dice also really helps the theme as you pit one man against a monster with no hope of returning because it might be amazing!

Preliminary 7. It's a solid, straight-forward WP game with a few little twists. It's got die luck, which not everyone will enjoy, but I found that added nice tension to the game.

the negatives for me: 
- blame tokens are annoying and bring a take that-element no one needed or asked for. also if everyone picks on one person, it's really not fun for them.
- horns are good for rerolling, yes, but "little horns" would have been great too (to e.g. change one die face from a blank to a single hit etc.)
- luck in general isn't the best mechanic in worker placement games (and for instance in Stone Age at least you always get something)
- draugrs and trolls are fine for the first two rounds but after that it justs gets lame and repetitive. couldn't there be a more wide variety of monsters like with the creatures overseas?
tl;dr: a great premise, nicely thematic, amazing artwork, but ultimately it just falls short for me. not a bad game by any means, but just not for me.

Viking worker placement - collect food, wood ,gold and more importantly warriors to fight trolls that are attacking your village and near by villages or hire/buy long-ship's and send your warriors with food across the sea for more risker but richer rewarding monsters. The winner is crowned the new Jarl (village leader)

easy rules with excellent artwork and solid components the only small gripe I have is the food n wood cubes are very similar in colour

Sold This for 2 reasons :-
1) Scoring points is 95% done via killing monster/trolls/other things attacking your village.This is all based on rolling dice - If you roll all blanks your stuffed and could lose everything - Once this happens it is near impossible to catch up.
I rolled all blanks on my 2nd turn used a reroll token and rolled all blanks again - I had no chance of catching up and spent the rest of the game feeling like a "also ran"

2)Character abilities are unbalanced - One charater scores a victory point if he rolls a double attack symbol which is by far the best power to have. 2 of the other player abilities can be blocked by other players.

SOLD as I cant see myself playing it again - An expansion is out which is supposed to deal with the combat issue. Wont hold my breath

Tried on Tabletopia. Beautifully produced and really hits the fantasy viking theme well, with a neat take on worker placement. I think it CAN replace Lords of Waterdeep for some of the fans of this kind of more thematic worker placement, but a significant portion of the LOTW fans will be put off by the random aspect to defeating the monsters. It knocked it down slightly for me, even though it's so well produced. I'd still play it.

No sé si es un remplazo completo a Lords of Waterdeep porque siento que le faltan edificios para ampliar la rejugabilidad. El azar de los dados puede ser un factor decisivo para algunos jugadores porque sí puede afectar completamente el juego, a mí me da igual, pero sí me ha ido muy mal por algunas tiradas. La carne y la madera se parecen mucho, fuera de eso los componentes están bien y el arte también (aunque es repetitivo en algunas de las cartas de monstruos).

UPDATE: Due to massive amount of time deciding what game to play, I gave it a shot again without the expansion.  While I think the game much better without the expansions and only four people instead of the overcrowding five, it's still a run-of-the-mill worker placement game with dice.  Better than Lords of Waterdeep, but I would still play Viticulture over this.  Viticulture provides tactical decisions with long term planning, whereas Champions of Midgard is riding the wave and hoping for the best.  It's okay for what it is.

This game, much like Lords of Waterdeep, reminds me why I dislike traditional worker placement games.

It's quite obvious where you need to go, so the only conflict with other players in the entire game is if someone blocks you out of inconvenience.  Furthermore, your "steps" to killing monsters is the same for everyone else: Gather warriors, gather food, get a ship for the journey.  You can skip the food part to attack easier enemies, but you won't get much points for it.  It's the same linear path to get to the fighting for the next eight rounds.

The randomization in the game is based on a few locations, fighting, and the journey cards.  The locations are fine such as the merchant ship which adds some variety to the game.  Journey cards forces risk management to the mix, another interesting design element.  Finally, the dice themselves during combat feels quick and fair.  In fact, the randomization elements in the game is the only interesting aspect of Champions of Midgard.

However, much like Lords of Waterdeep, I don't want to touch this game again.  I have played this game with the expansions and I don't see how playing just the base game would improve this.  Viticulture comes across as a far more interesting and enjoyable worker placement game.

Excellent worker placement game with a nice combat mechanic added on top of it. 
Tops: 
- the game offers you various routes to achieve victory points, lots of choices to make by each player 
- takes about an hour and a half to play
- each turn is divided into steps that are played simultaneously, this results in very little downtime 
- scales well from 2 to 4 players
Tips:
- components could be done better, especially the food and wood cubes

Really disappointed with this one. It's not a bad game, but it's certainly not a good one either. I had really high expectations for it, especially since many said it was a better Lords of Waterdeep. Those people are crazy. Comparing LOW and COM is like comparing 7 Wonders and Sushi Go. The latter is what COM feels like. That is, it feels mindless. 

Beyond that complaint, here are the other problems I have with the game: 

-Combat is NOT interesting, at all (yawn)
-Decisions are self-evident. Basically, get as many dice as possible. 
-It doesn't play well with 2.
-The card quality is the WORST I have ever seen. EVER...

I'm sorry to say, that despite some cool dice and a fun theme, this one is a bust.

The theme comes through in this one, so much so that I get excited just setting it up. I love the components and everything works really well. The only criticism I have is that there doesn't seem to be a multitude of strategies. That is, if you don't fight monsters, you have almost no chance to win. That's disappointing. I'm three plays in right now, so I'll see if my perception changes in the future. Either way, I"m enjoying myself.

Bought at Cardhaus black friday sale.

Generally solid game.  Scales from 2 - 4 players by adding market spaces and ships.  Dice can be a bit swingy, but it feels thematic.  Taking a group of Viking warriors to fight the sea serpent across the ocean after encountering a storm is pretty fun.  Blame is much more harsh than you'd realize.

Fun, but very light (i.e. Lords of Waterdeep).  This can be very luck dependant, as my first game built up a large army of dice to have them wiped out by a single troll. (all blanks on 4 consecutive rolls)

Edit after 5th play - (3rd with the expansions) I thoroughly enjoy this game and will happily play it if ever asked.  We've played 5 weeks in a row now, bringing in new players each game teaching rules.  The two expansions are must haves, they  really improve the game.  Rolling dice, sending your warriors to valhalla and cashing them in for other things.   Man...such fun.  5 is doable, but can drag on a little with AP Prone or newer gamers, 4 is a sweet spot.

Thoughts after 3rd overall play - first 5p game and first game with both expansions :  VERY enjoyable game, the expansions are a must play once you get the base mechanics - fixed a few of the 'problems' we had with the base game.  Really enjoying this game, hope for several more plays this year before the group wants to move on to something else.  I've been surprised that scoring has been so close end game, keeping the spread under 10 is impressive, really don't know who's going to win for sure until its over.

Thoughts after first play:
Enjoyable game, have not yet played a full game with expansions but definitely see the value they add (even if they add some complexity)

RATING: 8
Worker placement with some combat dice rolling - place workers, go after victory points (Glory) by challenging monsters. You are not assured of winning since the custom dice need to be rolled to beat the monster's defense. Combat is critical to winner, and you constantly lose warriors (dice). Plays fast, has several legitimate strategies as paths to winning. A little bit of interaction with the Troll mechanic, but otherwise a game with little "meanness" in it. 

Not terribly deep, but lots of fun.

A bit too dice driven for people with poor dice luck like me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The very first time I played this game, I felt let down. The reason for that is that before I bought the game, I had heard it being compared to Lords of Waterdeep, which created certain expectations in me that this game simply couldn't live up to, and I focused so much on what it was lacking that I didn't appreciate the game for what it was. I actually almost didn't bring it back to the table, but I decided I needed to play the game not comparing it to something else, but seeing it for what it was before I decided its future on my game shelf.

That second and third gameplay ultimately saved my opinion of the game, because it actually is a really neat game. You have a character with a special ability, you have a secret scoring objective, and you can get more as the game progresses, you collect warriors of different types that you can send off to fight monsters, which give you glory (points) and some other reward (wood, money, favour of the gods), and some of them might live to fight another day.

It's not perfect, there is little potential for variation in the base game box as you are recycling the same limited amount of tiles and cards, but it's a solid base for the upcoming expansions. As it is I prefer it with fewer players just so there is more choice in terms of leaders, and no one ends up feeling they were left with the dregs.

RATING: 6
Probably should have been designed around two shields faces per die instead of one; it was simpler to send my warriors on suicide missions than to try to save them.  That messes with the VP balance of enemies that kill many warriors and means that I could get the big VP rewards using a 6-capacity ship.

Disclosure: I helped develop this game.  
Definitely in the same design space as LoW, but the dice add much more excitement and theme.  I usually hate dice in my games, but this one is not nearly as punishing due to the re rolls and the fact you get to decide how much you want to stack the odds in your favor.  Every decision you make seems meaningful and rarely are you left with a useless choice for your worker placement.  We have found through many plays that the winner tends to be the better / more knowledgable player.  I have lost games where I succeeded in all my battles and the winner did not.  In this game, fortune tends to favor the bold, but not the stupid.

A light to medium weight worker placement game with dice! i like that dice can be managed, you do not have to accept the dice you roll. There are easy ways to gain rerolls but its risk vs reward. Game is easy to teach and its play time is just right. I would like thicker cards though. Very excited for the expansions to come this summer 2017.

RATING: 9
Possibly my favorite worker placement game right now.  Great theming and a lot of fun with different approaches to victory and asymmetrical powers.  The downside is that the resource economy isn't immediately apparent to new players - since it's unlike many other worker placement games - and the wooden upgraded pieces may not actually be an upgrade over the cardboard. (I've never played without the expansions.)  I also wish runes mattered more.

Update: This has fallen slightly with repeat plays, but that might be a function of always teaching new players combined with tough competition from other worker placement games such as The Godfather.

As far as I'm concerned, A Feast for Odin is the undisputed Jarl of viking worker placement. This game had a terrible amount of Kickstarter bloat. Perhaps just the base game would be a better experience, but with all the stuff there was in this game, it was just too much. This was ok and included some clever stuff (like gaining benefits from losing dice, which encourages combat), but I'd much rather play Odin.

Indifferent.

My friends like Lords of Waterdeep a fair amount. This one is similar and has a cool vikings theme (and art). I only got it because there was a recent kickstarter for expansions which hopefully increase the complexity of the game. We played it once (no expansions) and it was a "oh god why did I buy this game" game. We've since played it a few times with both expansions, and it is a TON better. We like it more than waterdeep now.

RATING: 7
For a [i]Worker Placement Euro[/i] this is about as good as it gets for me!

A strong feeling Viking theme and a splash of luck via dice based combat against the game's monsters keeps things feeling compelling and unpredictable.

I'm least interested and most frustrated by the actual worker placement part of the game but this is pretty normal where Euros are concerned. There's always too much you want to do and not enough actions to do it (and when there is some other dick always places his dude there first).

The variable player powers have the potential to swing the game quite heavily in the right hands, as does bogarting dice, getting lucky with your secret objectives or hogging Troll battles.

There's not quite enough variety in monsters, although it has several little things that are just done right such as modular market tiles and the ability to exchange excess supplies to something different on the main unchanging market square.

The combat is great too, being both a perfect match of luck, resource management and odds calculation that is streamlined and uncomplicated. I'd be happy to just play a different game that used this combat system!

I suspect with several back to back plays this would get old super fast as its quite samey feeling from game to game, but once in a while is just fine.

Early rating. This is a great worker placement game dripping theme and easily replaced Lords of Waterdeep for me. With the latter I had to get people to read the cards and encourage them to call the resources by name (not orange/white cube!). With CoM, you feel like you're fighting each time and it's very satisfying. The expansions made it even better. Especially Valhalla meaning that a lost battle has a silver lining and you can even go for a tactical dice loss.

Four plays in now, last 2 being with both expansions.  The expansions bring this game up to a 10/10 for me.  Great game!

Two plays in now.  Wow, I really like this game a lot.  With more plays, this could just hit a 10/10 for me.

Was worried by reports of the part luck played in dice rolling for the warriors.  But found that this was quite manageable with the favor tokens.  Also, even though there is more luck involved in this game than most other worker placement type games, it is thematic and adds spice to the game.  Very fun and engaging game.

Not quite a Lords of Waterdeep Killer but still fun.  Many of the mechanics are similar but CoM delivers everything in a much more thematic package.  The dice combat does add some unwanted randomness but the luck can be mitigated. However, in the end bad dice rolls will kill your fun.  Hoping an expansion will add even more luck mitigation. Love the art.

Only thing I miss about Lords of Waterdeep when playing this - and it may seem silly - is the unique quest descriptions.  Somehow makes it feel a little bit richer and more epic.  That piece notwithstanding, this is a much more immediate, visceral, and compelling experience, though the dice rolls may frustrate.  Really good stuff. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game is solidly fun, quite simple to learn and seems underrated in my own opinion. Not the typical boring worker placement stuff; you often have to push your luck and stakes are high. However, some characters really appear really superior to others. More locations to select (e.g. training hut to "upgrade" dices, battle arena to roll for glory, etc.), more epic monsters (e.g. 2/4 or 3/3 stats), more starting characters and better usage of the Blame mechanics would have been nice. This game is excellent, but some simple fixes would have made it perfect. If you like Lords of Waterdeep, you'll probably enjoy this one.

[b]Champions of Midgard[/b] was sold via auction 2/19/17. 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> [b]4[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]I ended up getting a copy of Champions of Midgard to play with my family. We soon played a second game and my son and I enjoyed our second play much less than our first. The randomness of the dice made the game unenjoyable for everyone involved even though it was mostly my daughter getting crushed by bad die rolls. It's not fun winning a game, especially one that takes 90+ minutes, when luck was the main reason for the victory. Yes, the classic Euro mechanisms are fun, but the emphasis on the die rolls combined with very little way of manipulating the dice leaves me with no desire to play this again.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I'd wanted to play this one for a while and originally ended up buying Blood Rage over Champions. Well Blood Rage is gone and now that I played Champions I'm glad it's in our collection. In a nutshell it takes Lords of Waterdeep (a game I still really like) and introduces a push your luck element because you must roll custom dice to defeat the monsters you are attacking. It goes from collecting x number of fighters, etc. to collecting certain dice and then hoping you roll well enough to not only defeat the monster but also not wipe out your entire force. 

Other than that it plays very similar to LoW, the worker placement element doesn't bring anything new to the table, but that's okay because the push your luck aspect added to the game is enough to keep it in my collection. I should also mention there is a high level of player interaction/take that because there are blame tokens which get dished out during the game, think corruption in LoW except you can decide who to give them to so be warned this is much nastier than LoW. 

I'll be keeping Champions and LoW in our collection because they do offer different play experiences and my wife would hate the randomness of die rolling introduced into a worker placement game.[/i]

Nice light to mid worker placement game. A bit heavier and meatier than Lords of Waterdeep. Plenty of things to work on each round.

The rulebook is very poor. I had so many questions that I just couldn't get the answer for without asking people online. I mean - what do I use wood for? Some of the costs of things are unclear and what to do with dice after combat is sometimes unclear (like what if I don't have enough warriors left to win? Are my remaining ones eliminated automatically or can I escape the combat and keep them?)

Played two games of this at a con and was interested to see two experienced players handling many things differently! Probably due to the shoddy rules and ambiguity. 

It isn't very strategic but it is a whole lot of fun and will definitely become a staple of my convention play :)

Champions of Midgard is an entry-level worker placement game in which players spend resources to acquire three types of warrior dice, which are in turn used to defeat monsters for victory points and money.  There are three types of monsters--Draugr, which provide decent money but little victory points, Trolls, which provide small rewards but also allow you to give your negative shame tokens to other players, and distant monsters, which provide big victory points.  However, to get at the distant monsters you have to rent or buy a ship, fit your warrior dice onto its limited capacity, also fit food to feed those warriors in that capacity, not be foiled by the hidden journey card which may make you discard warriors or food, and then roll to fight the monster.  Additionally, all types of monster may have text that says certain types of warriors may not fight them.  The game is fairly basic despite the somewhat convoluted method of getting to distant monsters (you build up to it); it seems to flow pretty well.  However, the game is definitely subject to dice luck, and the only way to mitigate that (reroll tokens) are fairly expensive.  That's what I liked least about the game, especially after the longish process of shipping a group of warriors out to distant lands.

Decent thematic worker placement game.  It reminded me of a cross of Lords of Waterdeep and Stone Age.  The hidden goals and ability to get more was a nice touch.  I liked the different enemies to battle and the risk of losing warriors and the different warrior dice.  It had a nice touch of the various abilities and buildings per game, making a different experience.

The dice seemed brutal.  The heroes appeared to lack balance and could use more than five options for a four player game.  Collecting some resources can be difficult vs other games.

Wonderful worker placement game about Vikings and the quest for glory!  Each round you place your Vikings to gather resources with the ultimate goal of scoring glory through fighting monsters.  The "fighters" in this game are dice that you gain and lose throughout.  Very unique.  Two minor complaints are the wood and meat cubes are way too similar (I upgraded mine).  And with only 8 rounds, sure the game is quick...but maybe a bit to quick.  Anyway, it is a blast to play.

(01/18) It is a fun worker placement game that is just not my cup of tea. I do not hate it, but it is too simple maybe? it feels dry.

I have played many worker placements, and they do vary for the things you do with your workers, this one however feels a lot like others I've played. It has a more "engaging" feature, which is fightning different monsters with your vikings, represented by dice, but the battles are easy most of the times.

The killer for this game is that I played Troyes some months before it, and found it to be great, and I think Champions of Midgard seems like a really bland version of Troyes, cause you also handle dice as workers, also have to get rid of perils that "haunt" your city, but Troyes feel deeper and is more engaging.

Also felt like Lords of Waterdeep, but without the strain of achieving goals and making new places each game. LoW feels expansive and its theme flourishes even just being a worker placement game. 

When I played Champions of Midgard I had fun, cause I played it with the right people but it felt too "meh" and decided to sell it after only 2 plays. A friend says we should try it with our RPG group at least once, but I really just want to buy Lord of Waterdeep instead.

RATING: 7
This is better than Waterdeep in my opinion. I found the mandatory quests too strong and luck of the draw to be too important when pulling off combos. 
If you are going to make a light worker placement game I think you should inject it with luck and theme to go with it so that people will laugh and have a good time. This is where Champs of Midgard got it right. Dice rolling is always fun and for a game of its weight I think they have included enough interesting decisions. Coupled with variable player powers but not powers that are game breaking.
Highlights for me thus far is when viking warriors embark on a quest to kill a distant monster only to get sabotaged by a journey card rendering the party without food.

RATING: 8
This is a solid work placement game that includes actual combat - something that is missing from Lords of Waterdeep. While it certainly adds new and different elements to the work placement genre it is hard to say after a few plays if these are improvements. It is very hard to get a good feel for this game after only a few plays as clear strategies are not initially obvious. The expansions greatly add to this game's enjoyment.

Pros:
* Variable leader powers gives each player their own play style.
* Nice looking game board, artwork and components.
* I prefer collecting custom dice to lame wood cubes.

Cons:
* As soon as you build up an army you lose them.
* Some leader powers seem weaker than others.
* The base game is only 4 players.
* Does not included enough male characters for a 4 player game.
* Euro-like end game scoring options are easy to overlook and forget about when playing.

Fabulous game. Yes, there's a degree of randomness thanks to the dice and, yes, that can prove decisive in determining the winner but really only if players are pretty equal in terms of strategy and tactics. A stronger player will almost always defeat a clearly weaker one barring the most extreme vicissitudes of ill fortune. Win, lose or draw, though, this game is just enormous fun. The theme comes out brilliantly, the core mechanisms are solid as a rock, the presentation is wonderfully evocative, and there are many moments of great tension and excitement. A truly brilliant euro/Ameritrash hybrid. Include the two expansions (Dark Mountains and especially Valhalla) and CoM is a 10 out of 10 game for me.

Hadn't played this game until now. Pretty cool dice game with worker placement. I liked it A LOT more than Waterdeep, a game I hear it compared to a lot.

Not bad and better than I anticipated!

This bad Larry is the "Stone Cold" Steve Austin to Lords Of Waterdeep's The Rock as it will stomp a mudhole in you and walk it dry. Seriously, this game continues to grow on me and maybe even in me as it starts out all "Supper's Ready" by Genesis and ends each round all "Frost Hammer" by High On Fire. The base game alone is satisfying enough but...

A worker placement game, where instead of all cubes, some of the cubes are dice. You roll the dice to determine if your action worked, and if you retain any of the dice for future turns. It's an ok idea, but the game itself is pretty dull. There's some luck mitigation, which is good, but really the problem is there isn't much to strive for in the game other than hoping for the best in terms of what you roll and what cards flip. The game also has a system where when the troll card isn't encountered, it assigns these negative point blame tokens to everyone. In future turns, when the troll IS encountered and defeated, the player who did it gets to hand their previously gotten negative point token to someone else. This turns into a sort of punish the loser mechanism because the tokens hurt more the more you have. Why would I hand it to the point leader when it only takes away a few points, when I can hand it to someone who might catch up in points later who has a bunch of the tokens already, where it does a lot more damage? Very meh on this game.

This game if often compared to Lords of Waterdeep, and rightfully so, but has a very different feel.  This game feels more "stressful" to me and my wife, like you're constantly struggling with resources.  I think this is more because of our mindset rather than game mechanics.  We always want to gather more and more but really you just need enough to take the actions you want.  

Plenty of actions to take and the destiny cards give players a good direction.  I'm not totally sold on the blame mechanic yet and I also feel the Viking Lord cards aren't totally balanced.  Some abilities seem much better than others

It's a good Lords of Waterdeep clone with the "theme of 2017: Vikings" glued on it. I consider keeping it in my collection (it would fill the spot of LoW in 1 hour or so) BUT, there is no way I'd trade LoW for it, since CoM does NOT have the same depth and diversity of choice (it does plays in a shorter time though).

I rate both LoW and Yedo (LoW in 2.5-3h) way above it, so, there you have it.

The middle of the board is a straight forward worker placement game. The central spaces allow you to gather/traded for resources and money. The resources are used to acquire more warrior dice and ships. The other spaces allow you to fight 3 types of monsters. Locally Trolls small reward but allows you to foist negative points on others. Draugr also small reward. Distant monsters require more planning needing shipping that has limited capacity, food and surviving the perils of the ocean before fighting, but these have much bigger rewards. You are subject to the luck of the dice, The only way to mitigate is to have more than enough warriors, reroll tokens (costly), Rune (favor) cards 
All in all it the game flows well, and is enjoyable, but I don't need to own it.

This game isn't bad, but in no way replaces the other staples of beginning WP like Stone Age or Waterdeep.  Nothing sucks worse than going through all the trouble to get dice, get food, get a boat and then watching it all fall to pieces because of a dumb card and then a bad dice roll.  It would be different if you could bring extra and then suffer the consequences, but NO: the boat only holds so much food/warrior dice.  A lot of things great with the game (love how they handle the troll and shame points) but not worth it to me.

Pros:
1. Great combo of Euro and Ameritrash. Placing workers is deterministic, but a lot of your outcomes are luck based.
2. Plenty of ways to negate the impact of luck. Horns allow you to re-roll dice. There's a spot that allows you to see which voyage cards will be safe.
3. Theme. This is one of the best themed worker placement games I have played.
4. Asymmetry. There are 5 different leaders you can be each with their own power. Some may be slightly better than others, but I'd say they are close to being balanced.

Cons:
1. Round Set Up. At the end of each round, you must flip a new troll, new draugrs, a new trading ship, add a coin to each monster, add another dice to each of the 3 spots, add a new food, flip new power cards and advance the round marker. When you're the only one who knows how to play this can be slightly annoying when completed for each of the 8 rounds.
2. Player Interaction. The player interaction is limited to blame tokens you hand out to players. Other than that, you fight monsters instead of each other. I put this as a con, but I actually enjoy that I can't fight my friends. This makes it a bit easier to use it as an entry worker placement game.

Summary: This game is a blast. I've played it with new gamers as a great way to introduce them to worker placement. Most new gamers get a little intimidated, but then pick it up fairly quickly. This is just an all around great dice chucking, worker placement.

RATING: 9
Champions of Midgard is a great game and a lot of fun to play. The best strategy is to fight and kill, that is it. So if you are looking for something with a lot of different paths to victory then look else where. CoM is a shoot first ask questions later type of game that values luck over all things. Which is fine for this type of game and works really well. The odds are never in your favor or the monsters. You can send 5 warriors to kill one guy and do 0 damage to him or send in 1 guy and kill him in one shot. It’s all about luck and it’s nice to play a game that uses it in a way to help and hurt you. The best part is the game doesn’t try and force a bunch of tedious tasks or resource at you to get points. You get points by killing things and fulfilling your destiny, to kill more stuff. 

CoM is a game that is fun and can be played multiple times and with the expansions coming in the next few months this game is something that should and most likely will be copied.

My only concern is that Destiny cards are worth so little and even if you complete 3 of them you can get less points than you would of just fighting a troll or monster in a round than actively trying to get the most food or yellow enemies. Maybe if destiny cards were worth a little bit more(maybe double) they would feel worth it to try and complete them. Also if destiny cards could be a one time use such as defeat a monster with 1 guy or have 4 warriors fall in battle this turn would help give them more variety and feel better about getting them. 

Overall: 9/10 - The game is a lot of fun and I wouldn’t let someone tell you otherwise. If you are more into 3+ hour long games than maybe CoM isn’t for you but for people who enjoy a 30-60m game and like to roll the dice(literally) then CoM is for you.

The comparisons to Lords of Waterdeep are fair. Imagine though, instead of picking up and delivering cubes to quests that the cubes are dice that each provide their own form of combat bonus and are rolled to defeat quests/monsters. Momsters are also categorized and there are multiple ways to collect sets for bonus points.

I admit, when I first heard of this game, I was not interested. Waterdeep outstayed its welcome and the thought of adding dice rolls did not entice me. It turns out Midgard does a great job of amping up both the strategy and excitement. Many ways to score points. Lots of ways to mitigate the luck of the dice. Light player interaction (some good: racing for monsters. Some bad: blame tokens). 

Overall: Champions might be the flavor of the week. I imagine it will fade from memory much like Waterdeep did with my group, but for now it is a fun experience that breathes new life into familiar territory.

For some reason I've seen this game compared to Lords of Waterdeep and I can't imagine why - they are completely different.

I don't like dice-rolling games that don't give you options.  I'm not looking for a consolation prize, I'm looking for options.  This game does not give you options.  

Me: This roll didn't go well.
Game: Well, &*^# you then.

I will likely never play this game again.

It takes a while to teach the game to people who aren't used to worker placement games. The battles are simple, but give it a nice twist instead of just "go hear, do this". The only thing is it seems that attacking the monsters at the bottom are the ONLY way to truly win the game. The quests only give you marginal points. With only 8 rounds, you've got to hit the big ones as much as possible.

This is a fun game.  I made some comments about the not so good components in the forums but I was mostly angry about the cards. The cards warped bad at first but over time they flatten out, just like others have stated. I sleeved mine just in case. Really other than that the components are pretty good, just wished they would have used better meeples. They are too small but not awful by any means. Over all a really good game.

Pros:
- Great art

- Somewhat challenging to master
- Various options of things to do on a turn
- Thinky

Cons:
- There are definite things in this game one MUST do regularly to win.  In a way that makes the win paths rather limited.
- It can be really unbalanced for new players who do not know what they are doing.  Since there are so many options they kinda flounder around and end up losing by a sizable margin.
- Questionable replay longevity.  There is limited setup options so down the line, if we play it frequently enough it might become too predictable.

I see the comparison to Lords of Waterdeep, but I personally don't think it's nearly as good as LoW.  CoM lacks anything like the Lords and plot quests that direct me to play one game differently from the next time; the CoM end-game scoring cards just seem like little bonuses that you might get, might not, you can't really design your strategy around them, and you can just draw more.  I'm also not a big fan of rolling dice with lots of blank faces.

Without the expansions, I'd only rate this a 7 at best, and inferior to Lords of Waterdeep, but with the expansions, this is a great game, and probably better than Lords of Waterdeep.

Without the expansions, you could get terrible rolls and be screwed compared to other players, pretty much knocked out of the running for the entire game, but the expansions treats these as sacrifices and gives you tokens for them, which you can then redeem for some good benefits, or even points (as well as get points for them based on some endgame scoring cards as well) to the point where you sometimes want to let your vikings die even when you could save them normally. This turns the results of the die roll into another decision, instead of just 'seeing what happens', and I think it makes the game much better for it.

You didn't really seem to get stronger as the game went on, and it just felt very samey after the fifth round. There were some things I liked, but most of all it was just a bit meh.

Worker placement game, in the same vein as [i]Lords of Waterdeep[/i], but with dice. The dice are used to fullfill the missions, not for production as in [i]Stone Age[/i]. Nevertheless, the game's feeling is different enough to get a place on its own in my collection.

Fun, but problematic, worker placement game. First, player powers are NOT equal; some are clearly better than others. Second, the theme was kinda there, but also seemed to be missing something. Where are the epic mythological monsters? The cynical side of me says they're waiting to introduce some of the larger Viking mythology in expansions. But the biggest problem is the mechanism where you give Blame tokens to other players for fighting Trolls. That's TERRIBLE. Not just because I hate that sort of forced-interaction garbage, but because there are mechanisms that make it seem as though one player is in the lead, when they may not be. The player whose power lets them gain 2 VPs when they re-roll is getting VPs on the front end, so they appear to be in the lead. They might not be, but they're getting bashed. Oh I hate that. Thankfully, you can just house-rule that people simply lose Blame tokens to the bank rather than giving them to other players. But seriously...stop doing that, designers.

Oh Champions, how I have mixed feelings for you. I enjoyed this game many times before playing it with the expansions at Origins, I believe I even had it rated as an 8 or 8.5. Then I played a 3 hour 5 player game at Origins. One of the worst gaming experiences I have had since getting into the hobby. Still leaves a nasty taste in my mouth. Until that goes away, I'll gladly take a couple other fantastic worker placement games over this one. It's a shame too because the expansions did add a lot of cool things I enjoyed. Never again with more than 3 though.

RATING: 7
Good ratings (and even better GB ratings) for this worker placement with dice game.

Update: a solid worker placement game that fell oddly flat for us (a 3p game). I'd seen favorable comparisons to Lords of Waterdeep and it just didn't do that for us. There is a lot of potential in the theme, and I like the way you send your warriors off in the ships to earn glory fighting monsters, but the overall experience was just lacking something.

I think maybe the theme could have been even stronger? I think we expected the monsters to have more variety and maybe even special abilities; instead it was, "Oh look, yet another Lindvorm, except this one is a 2/3 instead of a 3/2." Also it didn't seem like the Blame mechanic was as fully integrated as it could have been; it was just a little side-show penalty resource that we sort of passed around a little from turn to turn.

Like I said, it's solid, and maybe 5 years ago we would have liked it more but today it didn't stand out sufficiently to supplant other worker placement games, even fantasy games like LoW.

Since I have this game with all the Kickstarter stuff I would probably go with this one as it looks so nice on the table.

Played it at a meetup. I think it's a fun hybrid. You place workers to score the resources to then send your vikings to fight fiendish monsters (your quests). There's more luck than lots of folks would like but you can mitigate it a bit so it's not awful. I tried to do 3 raids in the last round of the game and failed because of bad rolls but didn't feel cheated. I deliberately gambled, was within range of winning, but the gods failed me. 
I'm not going to buy it because while it's fun it doesn't do anything especially brilliantly and also because my wife doesn't like games with fighting, even against fiendish monsters.

P.S. It has cool specialized warrior dice. Cool dice are always a plus.

RATING: 7
This is a worker placement game with dice rolls.  In this game each player is a Viking champion with a special ability.  Each turn they place their workers in turn order in very standard worker-placement fashion to collect resources, warriors, and fight trolls, evil dwarves, and other monsters for glory (victory points) and even more resources.  The warriors in this game are 3 different types of dice with varying numbers of damage and defense symbols showing on their sides.  Rolling them is how you do battle adding a healthy dose of luck into the game.

This is a game I certainly have to give at least one more play to cement my opinion on.  My first play of this game was pretty rough.  First of all, the rulebook is atrocious.  Many things are not explained or not explained well.  The components are also quite atrocious.  The artwork is good and the board, cardboard, and dice are actually fine but the cards are some of the thinnest and flimsiest card stock I've ever seen.  Sleeving them would mean I can't use the insert for the game any more either but that is probably the route I will need to go if I end up keeping this game.  Also the food and wood resources are represented with red and brown cubes that are the same size and very close in color.  Luckily I have all 4 of the awesome Stonemeier treasure chests and I substituted my own meat and wood tokens.

As for the gameplay, the real point of contention for me is the dice rolling to resolve combat.  I don't inherently dislike dice rolls or randomness in my games but I need ways to control and mitigate that randomness.  I didn't feel that way in my first game as I felt like I got worse dice rolls than my opponents and that wound up losing me the game by a really wide margin.  But looking over the components there are re-roll tokens and runes that can mitigate this and maybe you just have to prepare more or deal with the risk.  I liked most of the rest of the game (besides the card quality and resource cubes) so I'm willing to see if the chaos of the dice rolls can be mitigated before I walk away from it.

Interesting mechanics. Similar to Stone Age, but a little shorter with more tension, due to the possibility of losing fights. Still have to try the Valhalla extension. Not necessarily original and like Ancient Terrible Things, you do have the impression that the winner is usually the one who took some chances and won the fights on luck of the dice. Still a good game with great visuals. The only reason I have not bought it is that I would buy Valhalla straight away, which makes the game pricey.

RATING: 10
Favorite worker-placement-game as of now, enjoyed this so much. I heard it being compared to "Lords of Waterdeep" but I think "Champions of Midgard" beats it by miles. The combination of placing vikings to gather resources and then sending fighters out into combat against monsters works beautifully. And I love the dice fighting here and I usually never like dice fighting in games. I think I prefer that you have to fight the monster instead of combating amongst each others, that is more up my alley. 
Only played it once yet but I am glad we gifted this to my brother-in-law and his wife, there will be more battles in the future.

Note: My review is for the game + the two expansions.

Interesting take on worker placement with a lot of dice and thematic ties. It is fun, but has a few flaws that I find annoying. Specifically, the game has a bit too much "take that" and randomness with the rolls. It isn't hugely problematic, but it sours it a bit for me. Many optimal moves would be to heavily push your luck, which detracts from the euro-game aspects that I enjoy. Definitely a fun game, but not something I'd play unless I'm in the right mood. I think Lords of Waterdeep with the two expansions is slightly better (7ish) overall.

I honestly don't get the hype. This is neither a LoW killer or a Stoneage killer. It is derivative of both without the attributes that make those games fun.  

Pros: Great art, fun theme, great components, actions are mostly good and enjoyable, good play length

Cons: Random cards that screw with your monster battles, too much luck, that damn troll. The troll is the worst part of the board and is usually used to gang up on people. It is also not thematic as I am being effectively penalised for not helping to slay the troll, but there is only one spot there for meeples so I can't help can I? House rules to either remove the troll or make it so there are spots for the player count minus one are needed.

Thought this game would be better, turns out it's just a wasted opportunity.

I can see the comparisons being made between Lords of Waterdeep and Champions of Midgard, but the two have very distinct characteristics, as well. I think I like Midgard a bit better. Midgard accomplishes something rare for me ... a dice-based battle game where the luck is controlable to a great extend and tolerable in almost all cases. A worker-placement game with the tension of dice battles that don't leave you feeling the game is all luck appeals greatly to me, and so far I'm really enjoying this one. If I have any criticism, it is that players who burn through their resources toward the end of the game will find it hard to restock in time to capture many points ... but perhaps that's just part of the necessary strategy. I like that very different approaches can work. We had a player who did everything by the skin of his teeth, playing with just enough dice to win most battles. I stockpiled dice and did not battle until later in the game when victories were assured and losses would be minimized by shields on the many dice. The scores between the two very different approaches were very close.

This game is a ton of fun. If you like Stone Age, you will like this. Its very similar but I like the theme and artwork more. Plus I like how the resources (vikings) are dice that you have to roll to see their effectiveness. The game is very tight, works great. Its kind of replaced Stone Age for me. Maybe not totally but I find myself wanting to play this a lot more. One complaint is that there is basically one strategy and the quest cards don't really give enough points. I almost wish the points were doubled but I don't know how that would work.

Great looking worker placement. Lords of waterdeep style with vikings. After a few games it as a flavour of waterdeep but the dice make it feel more like stoneage. The whole game feel very thematic which for a worker placement game is strange
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good game. As many have pointed out, it's similar to Lords of Waterdeep in that you're collecting some resources via worker placement, then using those resources to get points and other rewards from different cards. In this case the cards are monsters that you fight instead of quests that you venture.

A couple of issues:
The rulebook. The rulebook flat out doesn't mention a couple of things and it's just bad in general. Not enough pictures, some things aren't in the place where you would expect to find them, some things are only explained in the appendix.

Another thing is the balance of characters. It seems like at least one or two of the characters are worse than the others. The one that lets you go to the merchant ship for free, for example. This ability may only be used to save you one or two coins throughout the whole game, whereas other abilities can be used many times or can yield more points.

The accumulating spaces (if no one takes that space in a round, more stuff gets added to it) are also a little odd. Those are some of the only spaces that let you get more dice, so at least in my games, they all get taken every round. Since these spaces are so desirable and always get snatched up, it's strange that they're the only spaces that can accumulate.

Luckily none of those issues detract too much from the fun of the game. Although I have some reservations about the dice, they do make for some tense battles. Overall a fun game, I just don't rate it higher because of the few issues and because it doesn't stand out too much among other worker placement games.

Sold.

I really enjoyed the game, but decided to trade it away because of the somewhat gory theme and questionable replayability. I'm excited to see what they do with expansions, which I think will give it more legs. I'd like to see a few alternate paths to victory.

Held off getting this for some time, due to comments about the luck factor.  Have to say that although luck plays a part viz a viz the dice in combat and hunting, it felt pretty easy to mitigate it by using favour tokens and ensuring you have enough warriors to take into battle, etc.  Plus, it provides just the right amount of tension.

Loved the game - the art is great, it plays really smoothly and has a nice flow, and isn't too heavy or long (around medium heaviness).  Above all, it was just good old fun to play.

Bad worker placement. So many issues. The dice based combat lacks balance. It is possible to hoard white swordsman dice effectively making dice difficult for opponents to get. I've heard comparisons to Lords of Waterdeep. But Waterdeep is superior in all ways that are enjoyable.

It does have more theme than Lords of Waterdeep, but I feel like it cull out all of the variability and combo building that I find interesting in that one.  This is very simple, gather resources, roll to achieve goals for points, rinse repeat.  I was bored by the end of the second round. No feel of progression, no interaction with other players, doesn't really do it for me.  I think its mechanically solid, the dice are fun and frustrating at the same time.  I'd be perfectly fine never playing it again.

RATING: 5.5
I don't normally rate in half steps, but I have to deduct .5 score for the component issues I've had. Box came slightly torn and has only gotten worse, the cards are made of gross-feeling, thin material AND they warp quickly when exposed to air if not sleeved, and the insert is designed so it's impossible to pull the last 3-5 cards out of the well unless they're in a baggie. WTH Grey Fox?

Game review:
Overall I love the designs and gameplay of CoM, but it has a momentum problem. If you get beat down early, you're always playing catch up. Importantly, this early failure could just be a calculated risk that you ended up on the wrong side of. It gives the feeling that the game comes down to who does a risky move that succeeded first, then just works on maintaining their lead. 

I love the idea of less combats but with more sure success and more preparation VS more combats where you lose more troops but when it plays out, it's a little too fragile of a system in it's current form. 

With all that said, I do recommend this game but maybe not as emphatically as Tom from Dice Tower or a few reviewers. This has the feel of a game that could be GREAT with the right expansion or two!

I like dice. I like vikings. I like Mythology. I like Champions of Midgard.

You won't find Lords of Waterdeep on my list. It's a solid game and I've certainly played my share of it with a few dozen plays under my belt but it also consistently left me wanting. Wanting what? A sense of action. A sense of adventure. Of danger and uncertainty. Waterdeep feels like a very *safe* game. Sure, every once in a while another player mucks up your plans by taking the spot you wanted or dumping a stupid mandatory quest on you, but by-and-large, you're never at any risk during the game. The greatest tension is hoping you've got more bonus points in your pocket than everybody else.

Champions of Midgard feels more like a viking saga. You're out for glory, be it hunting trolls, sailing against sea monsters or just trying to keep your clansmen fed. Your warriors are mighty and brave but even (and usually) the bravest may be called home to the halls of Valhalla. You just never know how your journeys might play out. And you get to brag about all the trolls you killed, to the shame of the other clans.

I'm not huge on worker-placement. It's an okay genre when done with gusto but does not, by itself, carry a game for me. What helps make Midgard work for me is simply how interesting the implementation of it's theme is. And viking dice. I love vikings as dice!

Fun! While it still has the points track that is the Achilles Heel of most Euro games, what you do in the game has direct consequences that lead to points on that track. Plus you are doing things in game that are fun like killing trolls or sailing on your ship to kill monsters. This game is less about trying to calculate out some artificially complex machination that tricks you into believing you are playing a game of depth and just puts you into the action. A lot of fun to play even on the very first play for all four of us. It probably lacks in depth for long term game play but I would gladly play it again for the fun which I can't say for many of the popular and highly rated Euro games out the. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Strictly better than Lords of Waterdeep in every way. A good balance is found between the classic euro worker placement core and the fun theme with random dice rolling combat. The balance enhances both aspects: it is more fun than a dry victory point grinder but more compelling than a braindead dice chucker.

Viking worker placement to go on journeys and claim glory, gold and cast blame. Players have variable hero powers. Send workers to the village to recruit colored warrior dice with different attack and defense distributions. Consult the mystic to portend your fate. Manage your food for viking ship journeys to defeat monster threats. Use gained favor to sway battle. Casting blame for those who did not help to defeat those blasted trolls is a unique negative point mechanic that adds a disproportionate tension which I like and would bet we see more of in future games.

Rating might rise in the long run but firs playthrough was a bit lackluster to say the least. Also GFG ran a horrible kickstarter with so, so many problems ranging from poor communication, horrible component and delivery problems etc. the list goes on and on. I prob wont back any game from them ever again.

I'm still missing one deck of cards for Dark Mountains expansion so my first playthrough was just with the Valhalla expansion.

Champions of Midgard, you were supposed to be the chosen one.

EDIT: After a 5p game with everything in it, lowered to 6.8. Waterdeep and Yedo still reign surpreme over Midgard.

Positives: Simple to learn. Excellent production value, 
 beautiful artwork and components. Relatively easy to play, but has lots of depth to master your strategy. Individual player powers are varied and balanced. Scales very well. Worker placement game that appeals to Ameritrash gamers and a dice chucking game that appeals to euro gamers. 

Negatives: Some euro elements are pasted on to the theme (e.g colour sets of monster for extra points. Potential for runaway victories towards latter rounds.

Conclusion: My favourite worker placement with dice chucking combination game

It's a worker placement game that many say replaces Lords of Waterdeep. I think those people are nuts. It's not a bad game at all but there is just something missing. The fight against the troll every turn feels like a penalty to everyone each round and the drauger fights are total fluff. The spots to place workers don't feel great, most of them seem strategically unwise. Needing to plan for the voyage across the sea sounds interesting until you learn that all you need to do is send one extra of each resource to cover all possible bad outcomes. The monsters across the sea are not particularly interesting, don't have great art and lack strategic interaction. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Enjoyable worker placement game that does a good job of marrying up the theme with strategic play. The random aspect of the dice and fewer resource combinations mixed with the complexity of on the board makes this game slightly lighter than Lords of Waterdeep but probably a little heavier than Stone Age.

I could have gone with a more historically accurate approach to Vikings in regard to the artwork in this game. Though I like the mythological monsters I'm not keen on the depiction of the Viking characters and the artwork on the box is pretty atrocious. The rulebook is also sloppy and feels like a rush job.

< October 2015, Sold on BGG March 2016 - I disagree with those that say it's a Lord s of Waterdeep killer to the extent that once I got the expansion for Waterdeep this got fired from my collection.

RATING: 9
Great game, simple rules, well thought through, I like the turn driven ending and the player interaction that is not direct PvP which can put people off.  Not too many choices for the AP brigade, though sure some will still manage to drag a turn out a tad too long.  Great component quality, has most mechanics I like in a game and drips with theme.

Played again may 16 with two new players.  Both really liked it, suspect one may buy.  Comment was, quick but it's depth and variety to make it feel a much deeper game.  

It remains for me just that too, like it just as much now as then.

Great game. I love the theme, I like how quick the game is despite all the choices players can make. The art is stunning. Combat is not overly difficult but I like the pressure players get for fighting the various creatures to get more glory and avoid blame. I would absolutely play this over Lords of Waterdeep, which is not a worse a game from a mechanics perspective but totally lacks a sense of purpose, which CoM is great at having.

Excellent worker placement.
I acquired the extensions before starting to play, as it was reported to really improve the gampelay, and the 'full option' game really is great.
Tough choices and some management of the (bad) luck dice factor make it really interesting.
Lots of replayability through variety of cards, characters and market tiles.

Nem akarom teljesen lehúzni, de a játék nekem nem nyújtotta azt, amit keresek ezekben. Nehéz is megfogalmazni a dolgokat, főleg úgy, hogy a látvány nagyon rendben van és nagyon komoly hibát se tudok felróni neki a kockadobáson kívül. Ezek mondjuk rendesen el tudják venni az ember kedvét, főleg, ha kevés lehetőség van a módosításukra. Pár évvel ezelőtt hatalmasat durrant volna, de ma már ez kevés. Alapvetően egy munkáslehelyezős játék, némi szettgyűjtögetéssel megbolondítva, pár jó ötlettel, de valami mégis hiányzik belőle. A vikinges téma és pár tematikus elem is a helyén, de ennek ellenére nem hiszem, h többször elő fog még kerülni, tényleg nagyon sok jó játék van - és még jön is - ebben a kategóriában.

Very solid worker placement with a good theme but not for those that want a tight, competitive experience. It's a dice game.  There is luck.  The luck runs hot and cold so if you don't like luck, don't buy it.

A worker placement viking game that has a very tight turn structure and limited time in which to accomplish your goals, but also has a bunch of the luck in the dice rolling and combat.

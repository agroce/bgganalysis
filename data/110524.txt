Galaxy Trucker has long been one of my favorite games and holds a very unique place as a unique style of game. This game plays in a similar way but with one key and excellent difference: Teams. It adds a new dynamic when you can't tell your teammate what to build or where, but you have to suffer alongside with them while your robot is blown to bits.

The game at times might feel a little random, but I'm sure after a few games I'll learn not to crash my robot!

Goblins building robots to smash each other apart! Sounds like it should be a lot more fun than it is. Not very good as a two-player game but can certainly see how the four-player game would be a lot more fun as everyone is in it for themselves despite being temporarily coupled into "teams". Sold.

RATING: 6
Same sort of fun that you get by playing Galaxy Trucker, but with more chaos. Which I didn't like all that much.
Basically, you can't protect your machine the way you protect your ship on GT. There are no shields and the weapons don't protect you like they do on GT.
Also, when you are building your machine, you only get 5 components to use on your ship, and 2 of those are given to you by your adversaries. Therefore, it's kind'a hard to plan and build a strong machine. And, to me, that takes out the most interesting aspect that you had on Galaxy Trucker. 
One thing that I liked about Goblins Inc. is the dynamics of playing in pairs that change every round. In other words, when playing with 4 players, you can play 3 rounds of building & fighting, and on each round you get to play with a different "partner". But the players' points are tallied individually.  That was a really fun and different experience.

Not Vlaada Chvatil, but CGE creates another gem.

Pros: 
*Galaxy trucker but without the pressure of time.  This lowers the barrier and makes it a much more casual game to play.
*Pseudo team elements where you are working together to destroy the other robot, but at the same time are going for your own goals.  I had one situation where I was tactician and could destroy two tiles, or destroy one armor piece, and getting the additional armor piece because it would gain me 3 extra points.  
*Different templates make for completely different robots each time and also the high number of hidden agendas will keep up the variety of the game in terms of how you would build a robot.  

Cons:
*Only complaint that I might have is the randomness, but it is about on the same level as Galaxy Trucker (only exception is that you do not know the position of their robot).

First up: I only played this in the 2 player variant.

Comment quality is really good. Nice artwork, thick tiles, working gears and so on.

Gameplay itself was only mediocre. Tile drawing like in Galaxy Trucker without the time pressure but instead mixed with a drafting component. Number of different types of tiles is only four: Decals, armor, weapons and engines. You just try to fit the tiles that you are dealt with into your robot and that's it. Not much chance of customization or trying something special like in GT.

Second part of the game is the face off. First you seem to be more in control of what's happening to your robot since you can freely choose to rotate and from which sides you want to fire at your opponent but ultimately it all depends on the dice you throw. Sure, the Tactic cards can mitigate a little bit of bad luck but overall it just doesn't click.

Reminded me a bit of a boxing fight between two people who are blind and deaf at the same time and wildly swing their arms around in the hope of a lucky punch.

I didn't hate it but felt more like an activity than as a game. Suprprisingly, the person I played against loved the game.

Goblins Inc. is just an honest game with a big problem: it struggles to do too many things without being able to handle them.

As a matter of fact it doesn’t succeed since it can’t take care of everything it tries to and keep it simple at the same time: hence it simply manages to give a taste of everything without really shining at anything.

This game feels like a Galaxy Trucker expansion gone wrong. Unlike Galaxy Trucker, I don't really feel excited and building the actual robot isn't challenging enough. I also didn't find the goals very effective and I found that because of the team play nature fulfilling the goals was very chance based. I only played a 4 player game, maybe the game is much better 2 player.

I really liked the idea of working in teams with hidden goals and simultaneous selection, but I was a little bit disappointed, because you don't really have means to work towards your individual goals. The goal cards just tell you what to hit and what to protect, but where you hit is mostly random (it's practically impossible to target a specific tile.) So in the end you just try your best to destroy as many tiles or to hit all the goblins. There are some opportunities for good teamwork - when you guess what your partner wants to do, you get better results - but it's rather limited.

Overall it's still some fun, but we never played the full game of 4 rounds. After one or two rounds, we always felt like it was enough.

Way too chaotic for me. Construction mechanics identical to Galaxy Trucker. Disapointing.

RATING: 6
Pretty fun game of building a machine, and then fighting it against the other team's machine!

The partnership aspect is interesting in that you end up being partners with everyone in the game once, so you end up sharing some goals with everyone at one point or another.

The hidden agendas also add some coolness to it.  While you do have a partner, sometimes you and your partner are trying to accomplish different things, but it's completely unknown to each other.  Only when it comes time to score points do you know if you got the better of your partnership or not!

The only part that fell a little flat to me is that there didn't seem to be much variety in the builds.  There aren't many different types of parts to work with, so by round 3, I felt like I was just doing the same thing over again, and it started to feel a bit monotonous.  The hidden agendas help a little, as you're trying to build (and pass parts to the other team) according to the cards in your hand, but not enough to really make each round feel all that different.

Overall, a different, fun game to play once in a while, but not really spectacular in terms of staying power.  Galaxy Trucker is still my game of choice when it comes to "build something and see if it survives" gaming!

RATING: 5
[floatleft][ImageID=1350971][/floatleft][size=11][b][thing=110524][/thing][/size][/b] truthfully deserves an "incomplete" grade from me at this point.  I played it with just two players, which is clearly not its sweet spot.  In fact, I will likely never play with any number other than four.  In two-player mode, the game is both too leisurely and too thinky to match the whimsy and destruction promised by the theme.  After one sub-optimal play, I can confirm that the game is adorable.  But some of the more wonky implementations of core ideas will need to be offset by the intrigue and chaos associated with semi-cooperative teams if the game is to earn a more permanent place on my shelf.  The decision to represent tile connections through the overlap of quarter-tile quadrants often make it hard to visualize the giant-robot-of-doom.  Additionally, the pilot controls are counter-intuitive at best, potentially game-breakingly so (the use of the controls is supposed to occur simultenously in secret, but we often had to check with each other once they were revealed to make sure that we had consensus about what the dials represented).  Because of all this, my current rating is more of a projection than a reflection.

Playes ok with 2 players. With more than 2, it gets better, but I would have wished for more incentives and possibilities to really play as a team while pursuing your private goals. Due to the existing VP cards, usually you just try to destroy the enemy. The advertised effect of "playing against your partner, pursuing just you own goals" doesn't kick in since basically all players have the same goal(s).
Additionally, this game is not good for teaching to new players - for a game with such a high luck factor, the rules are much to complicated.

A lot of fun and for me, unexpectedly so - I even pre-ordered it. Unexpected because the theme put me off to start with and I don't like Galaxy Trucker that much. However this for me is a better game.

I prefer the way the tiles are laid with no time element (I find that unnecessarily stressful - unnecessary for me not for the game) and working in 'partnership' (with objective cards which can screw your 'partener' over). I also like how the Robots you build attack each other so there is direct competition and not hope for the best from the cards.

Yet to try to three rounds but think this would be preferable as two seems a little unfinished. Can also see much scope for expansions and it may be one of those rare exceptions to my no expansions rule. One of the hits of Essen 2012 for me.

Giant robot building, resembling in mechanisms Galaxy Trucker somewhat, with the only exception that you're not under pressure of time. While there is plenty of randomness, there are plenty of meaningful choices to be made and bluffing/outguessing your opponent. 

I found the game well done and I'm certain it will appeal to some people, but I found little fun, or just below average fun playing it. It was also pretty long for what it was. Therefore I don't think this will hit the table in the future. But as you say never say never again.

Theme wise I thought this would be good and it has elements of one of my favorite games, Galaxy Trucker.

There was too much randomness and I didn't feel I had much control over the game.  I get that Goblins would be crazy, but perhaps give me something I could do to offset the randomness.  There weren't many tiles, the element of trying to beat your opponent but also beat your partner didn't flow very well.

There just isn't much game here unfortunately.

Hm, Galaxy Trucker as a PvP version? Sounds pretty good and it works, too, but is it more interesting? Acutally no.

First off, this is a 2 player game, which can be played with more people, but you won't have more players in the game, instead you make teams and share the decisions.

However, GT is less random (yes, less random), as you don't have much control in this game at all. Building your robot and fighting your opponents one is fun, but GT is just more fun.

Well, this is a lot like Galaxy Trucker. I think I like it a little better, because it has the fight/attack phase during which players interact with each other rather than with a random deck, it eliminates the real-time tile grabbing, and I also think that the hidden goal cards make it an improvement over Galaxy Trucker. Still, it's a very similar game, so... chaotic tile-laying destructiveness.  (1 play)

Reminds me of Galaxy Trucker (and that is not a complement!) But it is more enjoyable. 

Clever game, like the idea's but it is still a dice luck fest. And having none of the three tactic cards available to you if you lose the tied competition makes the game (slighty)n broken to me. Better that the loser is awarded one of the remaining two tactic cards but chosen by the winner.

Galaxy Trucker light. Best with 4 players. Some nice ideals here but you do not have a lot of control of what gets destroyed except maybe with the play of a tactical card. The hidden agendas keep it interesting as you do not know what your partner is trying to score.

Mediocre game, the building part is too simplified, it's just a matter of ensuring you have enough connections to place tiles everywhere. Without a timer, this is trivially easy.

Interesting spin on Galaxy Truckers for having the random damage come (with partial control) from other players, and it's one of the better uses of hidden role cards, being mild bonuses that are probably working at odds with those of your temporary partner.

A light-hearted game about building a robot and battling other robots. Players are on teams and switch between the roles of Pilot and Tactician. At the start of the game each pilot draws 5 tiles, with various abilities, and decides to keep 3 and give the other 2 to the opposing pilot. The pilots then place the tiles on the board, which is different depending on the blueprint used to build the robot. There are few placing requirements. After the pilot finishes laying tiles the tacticians repeat this process. Each team goes through two cycles of this. After players build their robots they draw 7 cards, of which they keep 4 for scoring purposes. After tactics cards are revealed and simultaneously Pilots decide where to move their robot and what part of the other robot to shoot, meanwhile the tacticians each select one of three possible tactics cards, with varying benefits, they would like. After everything is resolved, with certain rules dictating ties on the tactics cards, players resolve combat. Play three rounds and the game is over. I enjoy the theme, and the gameplay is rather intuitive. Switching teams adds excitement, and there is plenty of psychology involved, however, playing three rounds artificially lengthens the game without adding too much depth for what it is. While I rate it a 5 it is a game I wouldn't mind playing as filler for a round or so.

This is a highly chaotic, somewhat random game involving some partnerships which may or may not have different goals in mind.  Found the game enjoyable, but I do not know how much control you have and you can get hammered with a poor tile draw and/or poor secret objective card draw to go with the tile mix.  Still, there is a good bit of fun to be had talking trash and trying to take out the opposing team's robot.  There was some confusion about what constitutes the front of the robot, but we houseruled that one so it was constant.  

Fun, but I'd rather play Galaxy Trucker in the same time frame.  Sold!

I don't understand how this game was released after Galaxy Trucker by the same publisher. Galaxy trucker is a fun game while this just overstays its welcome, offers a lot of choices that are not relevant compared to the dice rolling later.

Grałem w jedną niedokończoną 4-osobową rozgrywkę. Pomysł na grę jest bardzo oryginalny. Mechanika ciekawa. Niestety w praniu już tak dobrze nie wychodzi. Gra jest po prostu dziwna. Nie ma tu też większej strategii. Niezależnie od tego jaką stroną zaatakujemy i tak przeciwnik może się obrócić. Ciężko tu o jakąś ciekawszą strategię. Najlepiej atakować najsilniejszą stroną i liczyć, że przeciwnik się nie obróci. Do tego rozgrywka (bynajmniej ta 4 osobowa) jest zdecydowanie za długa przez co grałem 2 rundy, bo potem się znudziła. Plusem jest natomiast to, że w każdej turze rozgrywki 4 osobowej jesteśmy w innej drużynie.

competitive team based game about destroying poorly built robots. Try to accomplish hidden agendas for points, while backstabbing your teammate and beating your opponent. Teams cycle every round, so everyone plays against/with everyone else. plays best with 4, but 3 is possible 2 is bleh. Plays in about an hour.

The similarity to Galaxy Trucker is very clear, but where GT takes the best part of a gaming session this completes in around an hour with 2 building sessions followed by the envitable destruction!
In GT the game threw the random attacks at you..... Here you plan and engage the attacks.
Fantastic fun providing you can sit back and remain calm as your robot falls apart...... Confident in the knowledge that next time you will make sure your robot will win the battle!
RECOMMENDED.

----------------Preliminary thoughts----------------

Nice ideas, but the execution is not that good. Almost everything is decided by luck (dice rolls, facing, etc.). You have to take some blind decisions, and some other obvious ones. all this makes the game too chaotic for my taste.

It is very quick, especially with 2 players. 4 players works too, but not 3.

People compare it to Galaxy Trucker, but for me they are totally different. It's not a bad game, but it's not for me.

sadly the high luck component eats every strategy you might have had; also, the team/not-team rules do not make much sense. If you are in a team, what's the point of not talking to your teammate? You'll have to guess his moves as well as the move of your enemies. Just not call it a team...

This game is very similar to Galaxy Trucker--you're trying to build a robot, in this case, on a grid board with tiles that do various things, and then you have a cage match with the opposing robot in which pieces get blown off, etc.  Instead of a free-for-all on pieces, there is a drafting phase where you pick a bunch of tiles, and then hand the rest to an opponent.  There are only ever two robots, so if you have more than 2 people, you're part of a team that shifts every round.  The robot battle itself features a rotating mechanism that is tough to visualize (and I'm usually pretty good with such things).  If you liked Galaxy Trucker, give this a try.  I don't like GT, and the extra stuff (team play, weird rotating rules) made it worse for me.

Nice game, we only played 2p. Feels a bit like Galaxy Trucker with the building and the destroying. Giving away some of the tiles you draw is a nice mechanism (drafting I guess). We need to try this with 4p.

4p works fine too, it's a bit more chaotic, but the added element of not having the same goals as your partner is nice, and so is playing once with each person in the game.

This is a unique mix of mechanics to a wacky game that should not be taken seriously.  However, this is entertaining in similar to galaxy trucker or roborally.   i don't think it is as fun as either of those but it does use element from both and is fun.  I love games with secret agendas and this game has a cooperative element to it but everyone has an agenda.  Not a game for everyone and is really only a 4 players game.  2 might work too but I haven't tried it yet.

I got this game for Christmas in 2012, but didn't manage to play it until the following spring, and then never played again. If you think this means that we hated it, you'd be wrong - it was, as I'd expected silly, and fairly random, but also somewhat fun. I could perhaps best describe it as like a competitive version of Galaxy Trucker - minus the real-time element, but instead with varying partnerships and potential backstabbing. But it was just not a game that ever suggested itself to any of us as one we wanted to play again.

So, when clearing out our collection in 2015, this was one of the games that went on our list of dispensable games - and it now has a (hopefully) better home :)

15-02-2015. Rated after 1 (partial) play, but that doesn't matter because it's a repeat of rounds.

Each round, you and a partner try to build a contraption by drawing and placing tiles. Then, your partner takes control and programs it to attack the opponents contraption. Each player scores separately, based on what tiles they protected on your own or damaged from your opponents. 

I dislike this game for several reasons. I dislike partnerships, and I dislike the winning condition. It just feels like you're not in control.. and I don't like that.

RATING: 6
One play.  There were some nice aspects of this game, and in many ways its very reminiscent of Galaxy Trucker.  I liked the pairings, but what I didn't like was the lack of control.  In Galaxy Trucker I feel like I have a relatively high degree of control over my destiny - in this, the way the robot falls apart is much more of a luck/dice fest, and the scoring of the agendas just added another layer of luck, dependent on how lucky you'd been in rolling your dice.  Fun, but not one to play very often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This borrows liberally from Galaxy Trucker, with mostly good results. The combat between the two enormous goblin mechs is completely bonkers, and definitely what the game does best. It falls flat when it tries to give players a good reason to throw a match. There's simply no reason to not try your best every time. It's a shame too, because I think that element could have been really great too. Still, pretty darn fun.

Definitely inspired by Galaxy Trucker - in a round, you first build a robot from tiles in a team in a somewhat chaotic way, then comes mutual destruction in the form of fight with the other team's robot. Of course, there's a lot of different stuff and the games don't resemble each other but superficially, with Goblins being in my eyes definitely inferior. Less skill is involved, as your choices in which tiles to use is very limited (choose 3 out of five and exchange the remaining 2 with the other team), and the actual fight is almost pure luck with obvious decisions. Get Galaxy Trucker (or an expansion, if you already have it) instead.

RATING: 4
The premise of Goblins Inc. is what first captured my attention – frantic, backstabbing goblins are a great theme to work on – and for the most part the rules reflect the theme well. Players work in teams of two, but each team member has secret objectives which often result in conflicting additions to the robot's overall build.

However, the execution of the concept is problematic as it is relatively too long and complex for a game that thrives on chaos. The designer may be intentionally capturing the feeling of minions who are out of their depth, but it is frustrating to remember how to manoeuvre left and right correctly. And having parts of your robot randomly collapse is only funny for the first or second time it occurs, after which it becomes a source of frustration.

I should note that so far I have only exclusively played this as a 2-player game, but I don't think that playing this with a full complement of 4 would improve this drastically.

Best with 4; players form two teams (changing each round), each in charge of building and piloting a giant killer robot. One player on the team is the pilot, in charge of moving (turning) the robot. The other decides how to attack. Players on the same team are not allowed to communicate -- and each has their own secret scoring goals, so they do not necessarily want the same things...

The theme is great. The game falls a bit flat. There is strategy to the tile placement and in choosing your scoring options, but it's pretty light. The most engaging decisions are the guessing and second-guessing of piloting/choosing tactics once the battle starts, but I would rather get that same experience in concentrated form in a game like Geister, Pincers or Confusion.

I don't think it has a whole lot to offer.

Hard to decide what to think of this. Building robots is fun. Fighting robots is fun. Having a partner that's really not on the same page as you are is fun. The scoring...is less fun. The winning team always gets a higher score, which means the losers from round 1 are pretty much doomed for round 2. I just can't see a way around this, beyond just playing 1 round games.

Comparing it to Galaxy Trucker is redundant. Beyond being published by CGE and having some tiles to lay, the two games have nothing in common.

It's much lighter than most of the recent CGE releases and feels like it plays very quickly.

I like the team aspects and the tile selection determined by your mission cards. There's not a huge number of these cards though, nor are there tons of tiles, so I wonder if it will start to feel a little similar over time. I suspect expansions are already being lined up for this one.

My only real complaint is that the loser of the 2 rounds of battles seems pretty much doomed to last place and so scoring for them is a little redundant, but that's a fairly minor complaint. Playing the variants with either 1 or 3 rounds would address this however.

The game dont`t work well. In theory it is a mix of rivalry and cooperation. In practice it is neither rivalry, neither coperation.

You cannot cooperate, because you cannot talk with your partner and you can`tgiveany hints with your play (in Tichu you also cannot talk with your partner, but when you observe the game, you can suppose what your partner need). 

There is no rivalry within a team because you cannot pay against your partner. You don`t know what agenda he has. When you would know that, it wouldn`t be change very much.There are to types of agendas: 1. for tiles that stay in your robot after the fight (so you wan`t that your robot win) or 2. for tiles tht you destroy in the opponents teams robot (so you wan`t that your robot wins). In both cases you wan`t the same. What tiles you want to save/destoy doesn`t matter. When your robot should win you need all types of tiles.

I loved this game to death.  You’re playing with three other people and it’s a semi-co-op game where you and another player are building a machine (and it’s random what player you’re building with), the problem is you can’t talk to the other player while you’re building this machine together.  One player is player is planning their building while the other player is building.  It’s chaotic and fun.

Once the machine is built, one player becomes the pilot and the other becomes the tactician (and again, not communicating their moves).  The pilot gets to decide how they rotate the machine and what side to fire on the opposing machine while the other player gets to decide what special tactics card to use and actually fire on the machine.  It’s a lot of fun guessing what you’re teammate is going to do and what your opponent is going to do and I just had a blast with that one.  After the weapons are fired, you switch roles and fire and keep going until a machine is blown up or you’ve fired four times.

After that, you then score based on goals you’ve laid down.  Those goals can be keeping certain pieces on your machine, blowing off specific pieces on the opponents machine, or even betting for or against yourself (and of course, again, you don’t know what other peoples goals are).

Outstays its welcome. I prefer this game's untimed construction phase over the timed one of Galaxy Trucker, where the more experienced shipbuilder is almost certain to build a better ship. On the other hand, the robot tiles seem less interesting than the GT ones, and the limited number of them seen by a team may lead to a more luck-based outcome.

Everyone compares this game to Galaxy trucker, ok so will I. Goblins have cooler theme, more appealing art and the player has more influence on the game once the machine is built (less luck than in GT) and also you can play in teams. There is more interaction between players than in GT. I love GT but I love Goblins more! If I play with 3 players only than I would rather choose to play GT.

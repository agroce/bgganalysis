A simply gorgeous game that's both light and satisfying. Very elegant design, with that little Knizia touch that makes it more complex than it seems at first. Would've been awesome if it had any theme (like a reason to push those little stones), but the artwork is so beautiful that it doesn't matter.

Knizia is pretty incredible. I actually finally played this AFTER tsuro, and it is one of the rare games that COMPLETELY fires another game, as I can't imagine ever really wanting to play tsuro over this ever again
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Knizia's take on Metro, except that instead of scoring the length of our lines, we are moving gems of varying values along them.  The tiles are less knotty that Metro's, though that's not at the expense of interesting possibilities for diverting routes.  What gives Indigo a different feel - at least with three or four players - is that players share exits from the board and the value of any gems that go through them.  This gives the game a touch of cooperative play.  

Despite these nice elements, I don't rate Indigo quite as highly as Metro. I like how the older game gets nasty from the outset, whereas Indigo takes a while to come to a boil. 

Ravensburger's production quality is excellent.  A special mention in these times of generic or plain useless box inserts, theirs is exemplary. The artwork is as gaudy as cheap jewelry.  The rules are fine.

This is a pretty underrated game. It is a lot of fun and works great for my non-gamer family members. The shared sides adds just enough intrigue to make it interesting. The board also looks beautiful, which is a big bonus when I play with non-gamers. A fun, light game. I definitely think this should be regarded more highly than Tsuro if you are debating between these types of games.

I have heard it said that this game replaces Tsuro. I agree. That being said, I still can't bring myself to completely remove Tsuro from my collection.

Indigo is a great game. I love the strategy involved in trying to move the pieces around the board and the social component of convincing others to team up with you to get a few extra points. The fact that the points are hidden gives the game a bit of a bluffing feel. "Hey, he's got so many stinking points, if you take that gem with him, he will win. But I'm willing to help you get it to this spot." Often times I even enjoy crashing the gems together so nobody gets them. It's a great game. Easy to teach and quick to setup.

I thought at one time that Tsuro was a perfect filler game because it was easy to teach, quick to play, and had just enough tactics/strategy to make it fun for gamers and non-gamers alike.  Leave it to Knizia to prove that even great games can be improved.  This game has the same basic concept of building pathways that move objects on the board, but makes it work even better.  Now you have lots of different gems to move, multiple goals where you can take the gems to score points, and it forces you to form temporary alliances with your opponents because you must share the points.  I love this game, because it has the same ease of teaching and plays just as quickly as Tsuro, but amps up the tactics/strategy just enough to make it an improvement.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great filler game, it might just become my favorite.

A beautiful game that is simple enough for everyone and doesn't utilize any text so your illiterate or non-English speaking friends can play. Ways to win include scoring as much as possible, working together to score in common gates, or trying to thwart everyone else by colliding gems together so no one scores.

I would much rather play this as opposed to it's little brother T'suro.

T'suro just seems to have so much random luck, and the entire time I am looking for a way to end my game so I can play something else.

In Indigo, you have the same "place a tile, see how it affects the board" style, but since everyone is trying to score the same gems it feels like your moves are not so forced.

Bottom line, T'suro plays move players, but Indigo has more fun packaged in the box.

Surprisingly enjoyable, Indigo is neither a filler nor a full game, just something in between: it’s one of those games you play because you know they won’t last too long or require too much thinking but will keep you entertained at the same time.

I’d put it on the same level as Rondo, although I find the latter a little better. [i](June 2013)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - Indigo deserves a higher rating than a 6,5: hence during my Fall 2015 rating revise I rounded up my rating from 6,5 to 7, the same as Rondo.

Pretty great filler that is what I hoped Tsuro would be.  With 2 you are working on keeping stuff out of the other goals while working to slide things quickly to your side.  I imagine four player would be a blast with this as you have shared goals.  Looking forward to more of this quick, fun, tactical game.

Four player is pretty awesome.  We had table talk and it was a lot of fun!

Since this is all about moving gems off the board it is a little more cut throat than Tsuro where you are moving yourself so it can be interesting towards the end if a person believes they have all the points they need.  Definitely a keeper for me.

RATING: 6
This is a very good game but only for exactly 4 players.  With 4 players, this is an outstanding shared incentive filler.  Players are placing tunnel tiles (a la Tsuro) to move gems to the board edges.  Two players own each edge but the combinations are different for every edge.  So, the shared incentives are outstanding.  Love it with 4, will play with 3, avoid with 2... not sure if that makes this a 6 or 7.

I have always liked these woven paths. I am a sucker for Metro and Cable Car. Tsuro just looks great to me, but really, this game may be the best. It is so beautiful I can't stand it. There are some really tough decisions for a game with easy rules.

I am not a fan of abstract games, but if they were all this easy to learn, wonderful in production and beautifully executed then maybe I would come around.

This is a permanent fixture in my collection, and, for my own personal style of play it earns its 10 easily.

It seems like Knizia loves taking other people's designs for fun, light, children's games, and then making them slightly more strategic, substantially drier, and significantly less fun (I'm looking at you, Pickomino!) Indigo is no exception. 

Take the spaghetti-road idea of Metro or Tsuro, add a new point-making mechanic, and then balance the game so thoroughly that each game will be very close and often decided on the final turn. Voilà! Knizia does it again. No wonder he can pop out ten new designs a year.

I was told that Indigo was like an “advanced Tsuro”. My family likes Tsuro (they aren’t really  gamers), so I figured it would be a good purchase. And I’m happy I was right. They all like it (though none of them love it), and it’s probably because of its simplicity and resemblance to Tsuro. But while it’s a very simple game, the decision about where to put your tile is never that easy… There is some strategy, but luck of the draw does play a big role. And while it’s not a super heavy game, it’s much, much heavier than Tsuro in my opinion, and it’s a much better game. It takes about the same amount of time to play (perhaps slightly longer), but the biggest disadvantage Indigo has on Tsuro is that Tsuro plays up to 8 while Indigo plas a maximum of 4. I think it’s a shame that you cannot play it with 6.

I like how you have to cooperate with some of the players in a 3 or 4 player game as it adds a semi-coop feeling when you’re trying to get the gems for “your team”, though you’re really trying to get as many for yourself as possible. The 2 player game is a whole different beast, but I like it as well.

We have played this game approximately 15 times before I started logging games.
We play three players and as a variant we divide the tiles into three random piles at the start of the game. Each player takes a pile and can play any of those tiles on their turn.
I think this would make a great two player game, dividing the tiles equally, but haven't played it.

It seemed like I had no need for this game, as I have and enjoy Tsuro.  Isn't it the same thing, just rethemed by Knizia?  Actually it's different enough that it stands on its own (although it's limited to just 4 players).

Instead of just keeping your own piece alive, you're trying to manipulate various colored gems to exit the board by your own "gates" which you share with certain other players.  Trying to reroute one gem and not ignore others is a tough balancing act.

It's fast, it's fun, it's worth your time.

Components: I'm not really a fan of the artwork, which is more busy and ornate than it needs to be. Otherwise, it's all functional.

Experience: So very random. Unlike the very similar Metro where all my trains will score, it's just a matter of how much; in this game gems are diverted at the last second, or collide and destroy other gems. At path-building games go, not among my favorites.

Players are placing hexagonal tiles, creating winding paths, and attempting to move gems along those paths and off the board through their own gates.  Simple, elegant, soothing game ... simply pick a face down tile, and place it on the game board in any vacant space.  If you place the tile in such a way that you extend a gem's path, you move that gem to the "end of the line".  If a gem exits the board, it's awarded to the owner of the exit gate, as victory points at the end of the game.  Quick, not to taxing, and surprisingly engaging to play.  Felt immediately like Iron Horse/Metro, but much better.  Apparently similar to Tsuro, which I haven't played.  Very good, with stunning art.

Wonderfully simple probability manipulation game. Place tiles to direct gems toward your goals and away from others.

The loops underneath the yellow gems are genius.

You push little beads around on loopy paths and that's pretty fun.  Actual strategy is difficult since you randomly pull tiles and towards the end of the game it's really difficult not to help your opponents.  However, if two beads collide, they explode and no one gets any points.  I recommend doing this as much as possible.

Better than Tsuro, but that is where the good ends. I never got much out of games where on your turn you really had little to do. You get one tile a turn to place (no choice in that) and place it someplace on the board in a somewhat sensible place. That's all you do, other then wait to see where other players tiles go and hope it all works out in your favor. Relaxing to watch, but not much to do while playing.

Connection game w hex tiles.  Like TaYu with gems instead of hash marks on the edges, and plays more than 2 though perfectly fine with two players.  Tsuro-ish with hexes.  It's like Tantrix, only in cardboard rather than resin (I'd like a better quality).  It's like Entanglement (free as a Chrome game).  It's similar to Metro.  It's a little like Aqua Romana.  I have those games so I guess I kinda like this type of tile game-

This game is something like Tsuro but more complicated.  Many of the decisions are of the type, "which of my opponents do I think is losing, so I can more afford to help?"  Exactly the kind of game I don't enjoy, though there's nothing terrible about the design.  But I have absolutely no interest in playing it again.  I prefer Tsuro.

Indigo is sort of a mash-up of Tsuro and Metro and another proof that Knizia is good at taking an idea and refining it to perfection. Not that Indigo is a perfect game, but it's a vast improvement over both its progenitors. More direct player influence, sharing of incentives other than just an appetite for destruction, and still a very short playing time.

Beautiful game and excellent production. Even the tray that holds the board and components is well done. The comparison to Tsuro is inevitable, and I think this one is a little more interesting overall. Tsuro benefits from supporting large numbers of players though, and there is something to be said for that. I haven't played Tsuro of the Seas yet.

RATING: 8
Rating this as a family game, with my kids, and it's fantastic. The 3-year old can basically play, and the 6-year old can play well. 

If comparing this to Metro or Streecar, Indigo is vastly more enjoyable, because you move the pieces along the track on every turn. So you don't have to go through the mental gymnastics of figuring out which path goes where every time.

I generally dislike abstract games, so if someone convinced me to play this on a regular game night, I probably wouldn't like it. But since I started by playing it with my family, I've been very taken with it.

Tile laying, path making in the style of tsuro. It's a toght abstract game. Decent amount of tactical play, you can also attempt to plan a path out ahead of time, but the tile draws adds an element of luck to it all. Not bad. Not amazing either.

This is a beautiful game and a nice filler/puzzler.  There is greater strategy that you might think at first if you are willing to make plays that balance risky vs safe bets.  It's simple enough to play with young kids.  Makes a great 2p game between competitive adults looking for a quick abstract.

Three plays with two, three with three, and two with four. Simple, fun & intriguing, and definitely more interesting than Tsuro and Metro. It's not merely about figuring out which tile play helps you or hurts your neighbors the most; the early game is about setting yourself up so that good things can happen later. When playing with more than two players you can work together with people to get the stones to the shared goals, which is fun. 

Might be best with three; you get the fun of the alliances but you still have a fair amount of control.

Remember the game Tsuro?  Leave it to Reiner Knizia to improve upon a good idea.  Indigo uses the same tile-laying, path-forming concept, but this time the object is to move valuable gems off the board, collecting the most valuable ones for oneself.  As with Tsuro, the game is very easy to learn and plays quickly, features that made Tsuro so popular.  

Indigo is undeniably simple and easy-to-play.  While the decisions to be made during the game are light, the game is strangely addicting. I enjoy the twist of sharing one gateway with each of your opponents.  This means you will be cooperating with each opponent … up to a point.  While you are cooperating with an opponent with one gem, you are likely struggling against him for control of another.  This semi-cooperative nature is quite interesting and creates some very intriguing situations and options.  

I was quite surprised by Indigo.  Its ease and simplicity disguises a fun and addicting game.  Most games play in 20 minutes or so, bolstering the urge to play it again immediately after its conclusion.  It has proven popular with all age groups save the very young, making it an ideal game for family or church game nights, as well as an excellent filler for a game group.

You can play this with two people, and its fun, but like many games it's best with three or four.

Why? Because with four people plotting routes to accumulate gems, you get three players to steal gems from!

Alliances will be made, and broken. And since the gems are hidden from view, only people with great memory can use the score strategically. Everything else is trust.

RATING: 7.25
Indigo is another little classic from Reiner Knizia, where the good Doctor takes the  tiling/movement logic of Tsuro, puts it on a hexagonal field, and changes what can be trivial to something which encourages tactics, competition and cooperation.

The game sets player scoring zones around the edges of a hexagon, at player counts more than two some of these will be shared.  The path tiles allow the stones to move, but instead of player tokens the stones are different value gems.

So in the game an intricate set of paths emerges as players try to bring the gems home to scoring regions, often to have them re-routed, but sometimes temporary cooperation emerges as well, which makes for an interesting balance.

Another terrific little tile laying game from Knizia's court.

This is what Tsuro wants to be. I like Tsuro, but it's a light. Tsuro of the sea is a small step above Tsuro, but a few of the mechanics could have been handled better.

This game just works. You can't probably play it with younger kids, like you can with Tsuro, but that's the only downside.

Se trata de un juego abstracto de reglas sencillas y partidas rápidas. A priori, puede jugarse en plan colaborativo y/o destructivo, apoyándote y compitiendo simultáneamente con los demás jugadores. La mejor opción es a cuatro jugadores y con dos losetas.
No es un juego que despierte fuertes sensaciones, pero es agradable de jugar. Después de media docena de partidas, aún no veo una estrategia clara, pero intuyo alguna. Creo que deberé jugarlo aún muchas más veces para llegar a conclusiones. En principio, es un juego táctico que, creo, también admite alguna planificación. Y es un juego de "contacto" y que precisa cierta negociación.

Tremendous tile laying game! It's both thinky and crazy tense, with really spectacular turns; table presence is through the roof, and it scales very well. One of Knizia's gems, for sure!

The only downside (and the reason why to me it's a 9.5 instead of a solid 10) is that tiles tend to move a bit around, you need to be careful when you place them in order not to bust out of place the previously played ones.

Bokkensprong 21/09/12 met Ward(7), Els en ik. Eenvoudige spelregels: zeshoekige tegels leggen met soort van slingerpatroon, zodat een wirwar van paadjes gevormd wordt. Doel is om zo veel mogelijk edelstenen bij je eigen kleur te doen belanden, want die leveren punten op (Blauw 3, groen 2, geel 1). Valt wel mee; goed voor tussendoor, duurt niet lang. (ca. 30 min)

Sort of like Tsuro, except they're hex tiles and you're collecting gems instead of moving your piece.  My first game was with 4, meaning two players shared in each gem that scored.

RATING: 7
Best new Knizia game I've played in quite some time.

I often felt that Tsuro, while fun and original, really needed a bit more game to flesh out the core tile/path laying mechanism which (while good) was all there was in the game. That seems to be what Dr. K has done here, with (in effect) players trying to move victory point markers back to one of their bases.

The additional twist of all points scored being necessarily shared with one other player adds a lot too. This means you need to ally with other players at key points for mutual benefit, just not too much with just one other player as if they have a productive pact with other players too they'll be in a strong posiiton.

Another example of what I think may be Knizia's real strength since the groundbreaking 1990s (please, no more same-as-the-all-the-others auction games, it's been diminishing returns since Ivanhoe, Ra and Modern Art) - taking a fresh look at an existing mechanic or game (in this case Tsuro) and giving it a twist to turn it into something new and better.

A total Tsuro copy! (Place tile, move gem to end of path.) Like the Borg, Knizia has a habit of borrowing other people's games-- sometimes improving them and sometimes not. Is Excape better than Can't Stop?  No. But IMO this is better than Tsuro, one of K's better games of late. The different valued gems adds a nice layer of strategy with sacrifices. Alliances are neat. That you can put tiles anywhere rather than one place is a huge improving over Tsuro. I prefer the 2 tile in hand variation: less luck, more tactics. Family keeps requesting it so moving it up a point. Looks great too!

2016-04-27 - This is a pretty good tile laying/route building game. Along the same lines as Tsuro, but much better, in my opinion. Instead of just trying to keep your piece from going off the board, there are several pieces and you're trying to guide them off the board to specific places. It's easy to teach and fast to play, and I really enjoyed it.

Path game like [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/16992/tsuro]Tsuro[/url], Knizia-style,  with a bit more depth in strategy on the upside, but lower total number of players on the down side. The game can suffer from king-making but given the time it takes for a game, that's fine. The screens seem a bit unnecessary. It's easy to remember the score of other players and one wants to do that in order to make the right tactical choice. The screens only seem to add a memory element which the game could do without.

RATING: 5
Similar to Tsuro and Metro and other simple, tile-laying connection games. This puts a twist on it that has point gems originating from different positions, with different values, and two players share the points when a gem goes home to a given section. Is this enough to make this game better than the others? The difference is negligible. Game feels so light to me as to be a waste of time. Design, for what it is, though, is okay.

I'm surprised that I liked the game as much as I did. It look very similar to games like Metro, which I really have not liked at all. But the rules are extremely easy to explain and the game plays quite quickly. Also, it is much easier to discern where the paths go than it seems. I really like the scheming and interaction between players. While I suppose it is possible to gang up on another player and ruin the game, I have to think that everyone I play with would be greedy enough to not sacrifice their own position just to attack another player.

Indigo is a tile-laying game along the lines of Metro, Tsuro, and Linie 1 in which players build paths bit by bit, with no player owning the individual paths and everyone trying to exploit the paths already present. Unlike those earlier games, however, your goal is to move gemstones from their starting locations on the board to your designated goals, with the player who scores the most points winning the game.

RATING: 7.2
Reiner Knizia's hexagonal take on games like Metro and Tsuro. I believe it's better than both, a well-balanced, well-developed, interesting game. AAlso, when multiplayer, it has a twist.

It's a very different game when you play 4-player or 2-player. 2-player it's a fun little 15-minute filler that we really enjoy playing with my wife. Multiplayer you need to focus on distributing commonly acquired points evenly among the other players and suddenly it becomes tricky, even though with any number of players you have the same number of exits (which makes playing with different player numbers less different than one would think). I like it 2-player but it gets even more fun multiplayer.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Reminds me a bit of Tsuro except that instead of trying to stay on the board, you're trying to get gems off the board via placing paths to your gateways. If two gems meet up, they are both destroyed. Plays quickly. One needs to be careful not to place tiles in the illegal configuration on the gateway spots - it is easy to miss that rule or not think about it when placing tiles. I'd suggest playing with the variant of having two tiles in hand to choose from instead of the base game of grab a tile and play it.

Un juego divertido aunque caótico y un poco aleatorio. Nunca sabes con seguridad hacia dónde irá la gema.

I bought this hoping for a family-friendly abstract that my 8-year-old could could play competitively, so we'd have more options than Connect Four and dexterity games (both of which I like, but variety is good!).

I like path-laying games, and while this is similar to Tsuro I put them in slightly different buckets. Indigo is deeper, but Tsuro supports 8 players and takes almost no time to teach.

Indigo is beautiful, and somehow kind of relaxing to play. Being able to place anywhere, having exits in more than one spot, and the fact that gems can be removed from the game all combine to make this an engaging, albeit simple, abstract.

A much, much better game than the obvious comparison of Tsuro. A similar mechanic of sliding pieces along a winding, tile path but in Indigo this is elevated to a much more exciting level by having those pieces be points guided back to goals. Add to this the fact that you share those goals with other players and one has a tense, interactive game of semi-cooperation. A very fine game.

Clever, but not particularly original. It's like many other connection games, but the scoring rules give it a unique twist. It plays quickly. As a two player game it is much more interesting if you hold two tiles in your hand. The 3 and 4 player versions (haven't played) appear chaotic and more suitable for family fare. Like Callisto, Knizia takes a well known template for a game, twists it around slightly, and gives you something of modest interest, and possibly improved. 

After another dozen plays, I'm upgrading my rating. The originality is in the scoring. It's amazing how a Knizian tweak can revitalize a game. Indigo is quick, fun, surprising, and capricious.

Clever connection game works well with 2-4, but far better with 2.
The strategy is quite subtle and many players overlook. The key is to maximize the chance of survival of your own paths while connecting (thus killing) two paths which are not yours. So the second line from the edge is the battlefield for the opening.
I prefer 2-tlie hand variant stated on the rule, or complete information game by dividing all tiles evenly (3 or 7 each for 5 types). Once you play 2-player, you will not come back to 3+ player games!

Gems are placed in the center and corners of the board.  As the players place their tiles (each one with 3 tracks on them, ala Tsuro) the gems follow along the trails towards goals.  Your goal is to escort the gems to goals that you are in control of (evenly distributed amongst the players) by clever placement of your tiles.

I always loved the idea of Tsuro, but hated that you can removed from the game through NO fault of your own because frankly, that stinks.  This game gives you a more tactical chance to claim victory for your own, and it's very approachable by the non-gamer.

I'm sorry for Tsuro. But I doubt I'll ever play it again because Indigo is so great.  The way that the shared gates creates constantly changing alliances, coupled with the possibility of a strategically-placed tile dramatically changing a gems destination gate at the last minute makes for some great interaction and excitement.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fairly light game, that is suitable for non-gamers, children, but not for anyone looking for a deep gaming experience.

In Indigo, the players make paths for tokens to follow.  You try to make paths that bring the highest scoring tokens to the exits you own.  Sometimes exits have two owners and you have to share the points with an appointment.  Compared to Tsuro, Indigo is a much deeper game and there is no player elimination.

[i]Joel had told me that this was a really fun game that blows Tsuro out of the water (I've never played Tsuro). So when the opportunity arose he taught my son and I.
I have to admit that I was surprised at how much I liked this game.

- Excellent gateway/family game.
- Absolutely beautiful board and tiles. I love the artwork.
- There is a good amount of player interaction to be found, especially since you share some of the "goals" where you score points.
- Simple mechanics, but enough strategy to keep you engaged. It may seem like you don't have a lot of choice, but as the board fills up if you plan well you can score lots of gems.
- Great tile laying game that feels different from games like Carcassonne and Alhambra (which are games I enjoy).
- Sliding the gems along the path is one of those zen moments in gaming, at least for me (simple things, simple minds...:D)[/i]

A game that's sort of a cross between Tsuro and Metro, with players working to bring coloured stones off the board in the locations that bring them points instead of their opponents.

A few clever twists include 'communal' exit points that score for two players (and thus giving you some incentive to work together at least a little bit) and some pre-existing loops near the edge of the board that let you pull off last-minute deflections of stones away from the 'wrong' exit points.

But overall, the game just doesn't feel like it rewards advance planning enough. There is so much chaos (thanks to the luck of the tile draw) that it's tough not to just 'hope for the best' each turn. Since you can't really react that effectively to what others do, you're limited to just making the best play 'right now' instead of the best play for the long term.

I like it but that's mostly because it's a good quick family game. Not one I'll expect to play much during 'serious' game nights, but one I'll be happy to play with my mom and daughter.

My all time favourite

Bought October 2015.
Played many times since 
No 4 player games played - wouldn't want to anyway - too much luck involved.
2 times have played with 3 players - some strategy involved but also lots of luck.
Plays by far the best with 2 players - which I have done many times.
With 2 players it is highly strategic with only a little bit of luck.
Every game is different due to the random nature of picking the tiles.
I have only played games where each player is allowed 1 tile each.
Some have said that playing with 2 tiles each is more strategic - but that isn't necessarily so.
If the game is fully thought through by both players then 1 tile each is highly strategic.
If you draw the worst tile for the current situation then tactics & strategies have to be adjusted accordingly. 

Here are tactics / strategies that can be used - 

1)- Moving gems as quickly as possible towards your gate. 

        - this is why wherever possible as the very 1st move in the game you should move an amber gem closer to your gate - this is only possible if you have a tile that has the sharp turn on it.
Doing this means that you have moved from 2 tiles away from getting that gem to only 1 tile from getting it.
This demands an immediate response from your opponent.
If possible they should place a sharp turn to send the gem through the loop on the treasure tile to be 1 tile away for them.
This demands an immediate response from the 1st player if possible.

I have played against many opponents & am amazed at how many beginners don't get this!

If the very 1st tile in the game doesn't have the sharp curve but has the gentle curve then your move should be to move a green gem towards your gate - you have moved from 4 tiles away from getting it to 3 tiles.
Your opponent is still 4 tiles away - so a slight advantage to you.
If this tile was placed to move an amber gem you are no closer to getting it - still 2 tiles away.

If the very 1st tile in the game has all straight lines then you should place it in the very middle of one of your gates.
Moving a gem in this case gives no advantage over your opponent.
Placing this tile in the middle of your gate keeps your pathways open to this gate for later.

2)- Stopping your opponent from moving a gem through their gate.

If your opponent is only 1 tile from getting a gem then if practical place a tile to move that gem away.

RATING: 7
A neat enough cross between Tsuro and Metro, laying down tiles to get paths from the centre to one of your edges of the hex-shaped board to score it. What improves this model over Metro et al is that you have a share in each board edge with a different player, so you're building a mini-alliance for each path to get it to the board edge you share with one of them. Which makes for a lot of chitter-chatter through the game about this vs that. On the downside, it also turns the game into a bit of a popularity contest with some king-making as to who allies with who to get stuff home. In a game of this length and lightness that's fine though, but it probably limits its replay a touch. The game goes pleasingly fast, and the freedom to place tiles anywhere gives some interesting options about whether to directly progress a path or to lay out a barrier type tile to encourage it in a future direction. It's too big a box for the filler/opener/closer it really is, but if you don't care about that then it's the pleasant, quick tile laying game you'd expect.

This game does not restore Knizia to his status as an elite designer.  But this game does turn Tsuro from I game I do not like into a game I would gladly play just about anytime. Beautiful board and components, too.  The gems are hefty smooth pieces of glass.  The box insert would be perfect if it kept the pieces in place.  A lot went into the production of this game and it shows.  Another huge plus is that the game works very well with all player counts (2 through 4)

So simple, yet gives you just enough to think about each turn. Trying to maneuver the gems to your side or watching who else has a high score keeps this game interesting.

Doesn't quite fire Tsuro for me just due to the amount of players it plays, but with 2-4, I'd play this 100% of the time.

Played six 2-player games as of this initial rating (all in one evening, a day after receiving it). Wow, what a great game! So pretty too. I can't see myself turning down any offer to play. I would like to see how this works with 3 or 4, but with my 2-player gaming buddy there was no need for the screens and we used a modified form of the 2 tiles per player "tip" in the rules: Instead of keeping them hidden, for a more strategic game, we played with one tile always showing and then before our turn drawing our second tile so that we always have 2 to choose from. This effectively keeps one "hidden" from our opponent. This is how TaYu is played (which Indigo strangely reminds me of). The 5.9 rater's criticism regarding the strategy of once you "sneak a point lead, you then just spend the rest of the game crashing everything else" is unfounded. It is not quite that simple. Sure, some games can play out like that, but depending upon the tile draws/placements and focus on either 1-pt ambers or 2-pt emeralds, each game develops quite differently. In our last game I was slightly ahead and was successfully carving out paths and funneling more emeralds to one of my sides when my opponent cleverly cancelled 2 of them them out, effectively making me waste my moves and allowing him to position himself better for the final gem -- the sapphire. He ended up winning by 1-pt ... quite a thrilling ending!

This is a really cute game that plays similar to Tsuro but in reverse. In Tsuro your only goal is to lay routes to stay on the board as long as possible. In this game, you have these glass beads on the board, and you want to build routes so that the beads exit the board through the gates marked with your player color. This was a super fun experience and a great filler game. Highly recommended, especially if you are like me, and think Tsuro is cool, but a bit too simple.

This reminds me of some of the games that came out in the mid 2000's like metro and aqueduct with a pure tile laying game that is simple when it comes to rules however there is a lot to keep an eye on.  Reminds me a little of Kingdom Builder with a one tile draw and figuring where the best play is.  There is a nice balance of offense and defense along with interesting tactical decisions but also has some long range strategy that can really pay out if things work well.  Just really liked this one more than I expected and I think if it had come out 5 or 10 years ago it would have a lot more buzz than now as it really seems to be under the rader.

Not as pretty as Tsuro, but definitely a more interesting game. We're laying pipes again, trying to make a path for the gems in the center of the board to your goals. Goals are board edges and shared between certain players, so there are times you need to coordinate with your opponents. Plays best with the full number of players, or the goals are not distributed evenly. Collected gems are kept hidden to discourage ganging up against the leader, which works tiny  bit, but it's not all that difficult to remember what everyone has collected. Fun and quick.

RATING: 5
Absolutely beautiful game.  Unfortunately, it mostly a combination of Metro and Tsuro (that's not really a bad thing).  The twist to this game is that if you are playing with more than two players, you will share exiting side with someone else.  On sides that are shared, both player score for any stones that are taken off there.  That sounds really interesting as you don't want to give any on other person too many points.  On top of this, points are secret once scored.  

I've only played this as a two-player game, thus the low rating.  There is no sharing, so the most interesting part of the game is gone.  I expect my rating will improve when I get to play with more.  This is one of those games that does itself a disservice to list it as being playable with 2.  It technically is, but it's not really the same game.  [12/09/2012]

A very pleasant surprise - a very simple abstract that can be easily taught to kids and picked up by families. It's very charming in its idea (making routes) as well as in application (hexagons) and visuals (kinda like middle east carpet or ceramic ornaments). The most brilliant part is putting a shared incentive idea on top of such a simple, straightforward game. A really neat filler. 

One thing I mind a bit is that it might need more tiebreakers (once I played 3 out of 4 had the same score, and 2 of us were still tied after a tie-breaker).

Tsuro killer!  This is a very quick and fun game that has just a touch of mean in it.  It will defiantly reward the better player.  Unlike Truro you can have a strategy and some fore planning.

It's a very quick abstract game sort of like Tsuro, but even simpler. The hexagonal board is set up with a blue 3VP gem and 5 green 2VP gems on the center tile, and 6 1VP yellow gems on tiles at the 6 corners of the board. The board's 6 edges are shared gates, belonging to 2 players each. On your turn, play your tile (which shows some configuration of tracks). If you extend track on which a gem is located, move it to the end of that track. If you manage to drive it off one edge of the board, the 2 players controlling that edge gate score the gem. If gems collide as they move, remove from game. Play till all gems claimed ... Most VP wins!

Simple, fun little filler. Don't need to own it, but wouldn't mind playing on occasion.

This is my first play of the game and am not fussed. I wanted to try before I bought, but the wifey bought it thinking that she would like it, but she hates it. It is a simple abstract game, which usually isn't my style (simple or abstract). There is certainly strategy in the game, but not enough to make me find it compelling. The tiles, and placement is really fiddly, which makes me wish it was magnetic.

This was a complete surprise to me. I saw it on the clearance table at Barnes and Noble. It had a Tsuro mechanic. I've been curious about Tsuro for some time and it was cheap, so, I got it without much thought. It sat unplayed on my shelf for several months until today. We loved it. It's really simple, intuitive, and gets better and better as it plays out.

Interesting tile laying game where you're trying to create paths to your scoring zones. Very fun at 4 players when you have to work with others who share your scoring zones. The setting up of paths and working with others while also helping yourself is something I very much enjoy.

I'd enjoy the game more if it wasn't so abstract and it wasn't so focused on spatial relations (which I'm not great at). The game also feels a bit random at times, but it is still fun for what it is.

Must play with the "have 2 tile hand and play 1" variant to give some strategy and flexibility in placement.

Largely unplayable with 2 - everything is zero sum and if you somehow manage to sneak a point lead, you then just spend the rest of the game crashing everything else.

With 3, it worked okay. I can see why the scoring regions are set up as they are; so that everyone has some interest in every region of the board (or at least, next to every region), but it made a lot of tile lays largely irrelevant, until the gems were so close that you could finally prevent them being redirected.

With 4, the game is probably at it's best and is a solid 6.5 or so. It plays well enough, but still lacks any real tension.

It's perfectly pretty and functional, but just doesn't feel like it's been designed with any love or care. Very much 'by the numbers'. Also, the blue tiles that start on the board - I can see [i]why[/i] they exist, but they annoy me.

I don't like Tsuro at all, and Tsuro of the Seas looks even worse. Indigo is a dramatic improvement. The main improvement here is the shared scoring (with 3 and 4 players. Skip this game with 2). You now have to consider turn order because you sometimes need to work together, and you have to consider who might have more points than you because gaining that last point for yourself might also give the leader a point.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 4[/b]
With fewer players the game loses the "every gem scores for two different players" aspect. With four you have to cooperate, but also be careful to not help your opponents too much.

It is a 5 with two, but with three I like it much more. It has a nice niche with non-gamers who don't easily remember rules and can't/won't play anything very heavy.  

There is just enough meat for gamers and it "feels" heavy enough to even make Gramma feel like she's made some clever moves. It's pretty enough for everyone.

Postscript: I realize this comment may sound patronizing and/or insulting to some (it does to me). If it helps, please feel free to alter any or al. Of the above words - "feels", gamers, Gramma.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 2
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1.25

Only read the rules. Players lay hex tiles with routes on them to guide gems off the map into exit spaces generally owned jointly by more than one player. This creates shared incentives.

After reading the rules, I did not think that this game would work for me with only two players. But I got to play it this way, and I have to say that I like it! With two, it plays quite a bit like Tayu, only more streamlined and a lot shorter. The game is made interesting by the fact that it can be just as useful to play tiles in advance (i.e. near the exits as opposed to near the stones), as it is to directly guide the stones. And it is just as important to play them to help yourself as it is to play them to block your opponent. Like it, and I can see this game getting even better with more players, as you will have joint goals to deal with.

A tile laying game by Knizia in the same vein as Metro, Aqua Romana, Linie 1/Streetcar and Tsuro. I love track building in train games, but am not a huge fan of these multiple criss-crossing network building/tile laying games. For one thing, the connections look convoluted when the board is being constructed and often times, the confusion obscures and particular viable strategy. Tile placement is also constraint by what tiles are being flipped over during game play. This particular annoyance has often been dampened by having two or more tiles at hand to choose from. All these particular points mentioned above also applies to Indigo. It is tough to plan ahead, especially with 4 since the gems are moving throughout the board and the connections themselves are tough predict since your opponents can easily shunt the gem down a completely different path and by the time your turn comes around, the gem is out of your grasp. So, herein lies the twist Knizia incorporates in this game: alliances for gem scoring. In an attempt to rectify the smaller sized board and wild swings in gem movement, Knizia forces players to form temporary alliances to score the gems. Each gateway for gem scoring is partially owned by two players. Thus, two players will benefit from scoring and hence, there is an alliance. However, as the gem moves from one set of gateway to the next, the alliances will shift. This particular aspect alone makes this network building game unique from its brethren. This does not ameliorate all the above stated weaknesses, but at the very least, it makes the game different and enjoyable. Plus, it has a SHORT playing time.

This seems way, WAY too close to Tsuro.  Saying "I want my opponent's piece to reach the edges" is almost identical mechanically to saying "I want a scoring piece to reach the edge".  Regardless of what you want to call the piece, it's still one of many pieces that you're trying to make reach the edge, using the same movement mechanic as Tsuro.

Oct 2017:  Rating +1 (to 6)
This game does seem to play better with 2P than 3-4.  However, I think it largely varies based on who you're playing with.  If you're against creative/crafty/competitive opponents, the game will be a lot more fun.  When each person just stares at the gem right next to them and tries to get it to their gate, paying no attention to anyone else's gems, it's pretty boring.  I increased my rating because this is vastly more fun, with the right opponents, than Tsuro.  It probably borders on 6.5-7 in a competitive, 2P setting.

Original:
This is one of few games I regret buying.  It's not a bad game, but it's not the game for me.

The art is nice and components are good quality.  It seemed like it would be a slightly better version of Tsuro, fun with 2 players and a little more complex.  It may be a little more complex than Tsuro, but it's still too light for my tastes.  With 3 players we finished very quickly with only a couple unexpected twists of fate.

Yes, it's easy to teach to new gamers and even young/old gamers.  But if I was going to pick just one tile-laying game, Carcassonne would far surpass this one.  There's just not enough strategy or fun involved in this - definitely not enough to bring it out to play frequently.

We play this as a family (a 5 yr old, teen, and parents) with so the main goal for us is to have fun and interact. It is easy to understand and provides for a lot of laughter. 

Note: Since we play with a little one we focus on a positive game and have discouraged destructive collision of gems. We are thinking of instituting a penalty to discourage collisions but this has not been required yet.

This is a simple and fun tile laying game. The first time we played everyone ran an almost straight line from the center to one of their section with 2 collection tiles. It was funny, it came down to what ever person moved the last green gem in the center was automatically going to get the blue gem. The second game we all realized the problem with doing that. So now we were cutting each other off and sending gems all over the place. Really enjoyed it

Semi-cooperative game where players try to lay paths and move gems to their own designated goal/locations. Gameplay is a little luck-driven and tactical in nature.

Indigo looks great on the table, plays fast, and is fun. Moving the tiles around the snakey paths is very satisfying... especially when you can whisk a gem away in a direction no one was expecting!  The come and go teamwork to get gems to the shared scoring areas adds a nice element to larger games as well which seems to keep the 4 player game from being too chaotic.

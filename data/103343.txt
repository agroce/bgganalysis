A little something for everyone- multiple game mechanics at work. The different player starting conditions make for so much variability and the auctions are a great equalizer. A real drawback that it can truly only be played properly with six people.

RATING: 8
Recreates the feel of the book superbly, taking Diplomacy into a modern gaming age by adding some very slick "german" mechanisms. Some Houses are harder to play than others and repeated playings may end up with balance being an issue but this is no different to Diplomacy.

We tried it a few times. It always feels like your first rounds are completely useless. So, you are basically playing 30 min. that have no bearing on the game. Only the last few rounds make an impact. Great theme, though...

So, I am rating this game after one play. 

The theme is so thick, and the gameplay is superb. But boy, is the game rough. We are not used to that amount of player interaction, especially not of the backstabbing kind.

I had a weird feeling after completing the first game. Joy and sorrow, but such is the game of thrones.

I really want to give the game an 8, and I hope the next game will upgrade the score, but for now 7 is the feeling the one game left me with.

My wife would probably give it a higher score, she is a great AGOT geek, and she actually won our first game.

I like the series tv, and like thie game too... good artwork, but quite diffcult to find a group to play, given the long duration of time required and 6 players the game needed to shine. Maybe i need 4 players expansion game

Scheming, politics and battles, backstabbing, shifting alliances for 6 players.

In our 4-player game, the House of Baratheon seemed to have a huge advantage with its proximity to the open castles to the south, which one player used to his great advantage to end the game in a mere 4 or 5 turns. I can see the potential for this to be a great game, though, if some changes are made to improve balance.

Quem jogava War e gosta daquela lembrança (mesmo que hoje considere o jogo uma droga) vai gostar das sensações de um bom jogo de controle de território como este. As estratégias, acordos e traições são essenciais e dosados do jeito que a gente gostaria que o War fosse. O tema ajuda bastante ao jogo, mesmo que a série esteja distante de algumas das realidade desta Westeros.

RATING: 6
Update after 2 Plays: I think I'm done with this game.  Dropped from an 8 to a 6.  This game is just too long.  First game was 6P, quit at 3 hours after round 7.  Second game was 6P, quit at 4 hours after round 6.  It's also fun for the first several rounds as you build up, form alliances, and make your first attacks.  Then it just starts to feel like your taking and re-taking the same areas, trading back and forth, over and over.  No sense of progress.  And the ending feels completely arbitrary.  Someone would happen to win at the end of any round but if you go another round or another, it would probably always shift.  Not planning to play this again.

Possibly should rate this a 4 but I might give it one more go, perhaps with less players.

This game is way more complex than it should have been.  I imagine there are many non-gamer GoT fans out there who bought this, only to have a horrible experience trying to learn the rules with their friends.

With that said, it's a very good game.  I think the combat system is the best of any game I've played: quick, simple, deterministic and with just a bit of tension from not knowing which card your opponent will select.

I've played once at 3 players and once at 6.  6 was good, but you only really interact with the players next to you.  4 or 5 might be the sweet spot.

The game can go fairly long.

It may not be perfectly balanced, but that's self-correcting if the players are aware, even if they're ruthlessly competitive.

My favorite board game for 3-6 players. Takes the impeccable mechanics of Diplomacy and streamlines them to create a game that can be completed in 4 hours (rather than 14). Also incorporates tight, game-theory-grounded, secret bidding and hand-management mechanics and brings in the color and flavor of Westeros.

One of the few games that I enjoyed very much playing but will never own (probably), as it works best with 6 players. Very thematic, very combat-oriented, very LONG.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A streamlined version of Diplomacy, with various limitations ensuring a more balanced play, with less lagging behind of weaker players.
The theme is very strong, and is highly suggested for players who love A Song of Ice and Fire.
Relatively long play time, and requires 5-6 players to work well.
Will not work well with honest players, or players that do not like direct confrontations (war in multi player games).

RATING: 9
I've not read the books or watched the TV series but this is a great game in its own right. Possibly the best area control game I've played, it feels like a grown up Risk without the dice and with the diplomacy, backstabbing and pushes for victory that make you want to share tales of great victories and narrow defeats. Wish I could play this more.

We played three times in a row, as some people were saying they played 'nice' and that is why they did not win. As next games showed, it was luck which made them win and the 'girls power' still was significantly higher then the rest two players :) Amazing game flow, consistence and balance makes The Games of Thrones (2nd edition) one of the best games I played in 2011. Huge improvement comparing to the previous edition of the game.

Superbly thematic and can be a lot of fun to play but has a laundry list of flaws that mean it's unlikely to hit the table again any time soon. Too long, players can be knocked out early and cannot recover, some overly complex rules, balance issues at some player counts (4/5). Suffers from the same issue as most 'diplomatic' area control games - games boil down to a dog pile of mutual destruction and whoever isn't kept in check will likely win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game has a great theme. Although the different houses are not very much balanced this doesnt really bother the players since AgoT is pretty much played by diplomacy and treachery. The communication is very much needed in this game and players who get angry easily are not supposed to play this game.

+ Great tie-in with the theme; Plenty of room for crafty maneuvers.
- Must have a high player count to make the game really work.


Why it's previously-owned:
It just never got played.  I don't have the right group to play this; you need 5 other people who want to hunker down in a highly-contentious, back-stabbing combative game.
This was part of the big Dune CCG trade.

This is an exceptional game, which updates Diplomacy in all the right ways and sticks brilliantly to the AGOT theme. It's also impressively well balanced given it is very asymmetrical.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.4
Fun negotiation / area control game. Strange port rules. A bit too long. Has some down times. I like the overall combat rules (like Kemet).
Poor implementation for less than 6 players, there are no special maps. 
A possible problem might be that people tend to team up for the rest of the game.
The game is also way too long, it should be shorter (less number of rounds).
The game could be really great, but rules, length of the game, and player count are really annoying. 

Player: 3-6 (Best: 6)
Time: 120-240m

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Negotiating, secretly planning and staging actions, then revealing plays to the theme very well.  You must have at least three to play, but I feel alliances and wars in the game are more interesting with more players.  The negotiations and alliances may take a little time to talk through, so carve out an evening to play this one with friends.  This game can cause some hurt feelings when long-time alliances are broken with a surprise attack, so I wouldn't recommend this game for everyone.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A Game of Thrones combines a tightly-designed ruleset with a lot of strategic depth, while also perfectly capturing all the backstabbing, temporary alliances, and political expediency of the Song of Ice and Fire series. A fantastic game for anyone who loves the books or enjoys games with a lot of negotiation and diplomacy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Excellent game whose focus is on the diplomacy and intrigue and the combat is not luck based. The theme comes out in spades and the negotiations breeds intrigue as the game has no currency to give, just promises. The downsides to game is the time it takes to play, the base game needs 6 if one is totally into balance and the game works a lot more with people who like to negotiate. That being said I still feel it is a good game, can't recommend it more.

RATING: 5
I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Good thematic wargame, that will appeal a lot to all the fans of the books/tv serie. Being not a fan of "A Game of Thrones" myself, the theme is nothing that excites me particularly, but I see and appreciate the effort, that the designer put to integrate the theme in the mechanisms.

As far as the machanisms are concerned, it's a well designed game, but nothing that I'll go out of my way to play. The first reason for this is the lenght: the game is too long for what it offers me. I like the card combat a lot, but I'm not a fan as much of the orders or even more of the event cards and the supply mechanism. I don't like the way the different kinds of unit work and I also don't like the fact that you're not involved in the game with all the players. You actually interact only with the players that are close to you on the board, while there's very few or nothing you can do about those that are "geographically" far from you... and while this is fine in a game like 7 Wonders, I'm not sure it is in a war game. These things simply do not click for me.

Of many war games A Game of Thrones is not the one I'd like to play if I could choose. I like the components a lot, some ideas are neat, but all together comes out strangely mediocre. I'm sure that this game really shines if you enjoy the theme, but - if you don't - there's many other games you can choose from, that are actually mechanically better.

RATING: 6
This is an area control game based on the Game of Thrones universe. Don't be fooled, this game is not an adventure game, so do not expect to give back the story from the books or TV-series. Basically you will start with one of six noble houses of Westeros, then through careful planning will assign actions to your armies on map. Then after the planning is done, in turn everyone has the chance to execute one action having in mind that one must control seven cities or strongholds to instantly win the game, else it ends after ten rounds. The downside of the game is the long downtime of the planning phase, and it doesn't really work well with fewer then six players. The game can take easily six hours to play out, but if you are a fan of intrigue and warfare it is a perfect game.

I'll start by saying, I don't like the IP at all. The actual storyline frustrates me. However, this game did a good job of putting the player into the struggle, jockeying for position on the throne, fighting military battles, and using covert networks for information.

The game is well made, and a good game for 6 players. The length is long (which I knew going into the game) and there's a bit of a kingmaker aspect to it, but all in all, the game is well made, with good bits and I'm happy to play it a couple times a year.

RATING: 7
Good thematic game, but too long. But I realy liked it, feels good about the book series. The real problem here is that the game is too concentrated in battles, and even with the mecanics of the bid for power, influence, and the invasion from the north, the game is strictly focused in battle and area control. Works well just with 3 or 6 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a complicated strategy game that requires the investment of a longer (maybe weekend) game night. Love the themes and the art. The mechanics are solid but it will take a few games to really get the hang of them. The group matters a lot too (as is the case with most).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game looks good - it's a bit busy in places and is certainly an FFG game with all the chits and bits. 

Mechanically, its interesting - I take if you played it a lot, or very deliberately, there are best plays early, but I've specifically refrained from knowing a lot about the game so I can enjoy it two or three times a year. 

The 'intrigue' angle is fairly weak to be honest. I think the game is all about hedging and timing your run, which some might say A Song of Ice and Fire is all about, but I think a lot of people expect backstab-counterbackstab, and you just can't recover easily.

JEU DE GUERRE - Jusqu'à 6 Joueurs

Depuis vos territoires, vous attribuer des actions a vos troupes (un choix de 5 actions...raid; marche (ou attaque); défense; soutenir; couronne (ou taxes) et maximum 3 fois chaque). Il se peut que vous n'ayez pas assez d'actions possible si votre territoire est trop grand. Le jeu dure 10 tours maximum ou 7 châteaux sous sa gouverne.

Lors d'un combat, les troupes choisissent un héros et en additionnant le total des points de troupes,le gagnant repousse les troupe de l'autre dans une contrée adjacente appartenant au perdant. Le nombre de troupes est limité ainsi que la taille maximale de vos armées sont règlementés. Le jeu nécessite des Alliances et des traitrises

Le temps de 180 minutes sur la boite est grandement sous-estimé. Compter environ 1 heure par joueur... cela pourrais être plus, une partie peut durer facilement de 6 a 8 heures si personne ne se fait éliminer rapidement. Prenez donc votre journée complète.

Les familles qui sont dans le milieu du plateau sont désavantagée géographiquement et devront utiliser des alliances.  

Le pouvoir de l'épée débalance le jeu si les enchères ne sortent pas souvent.

Fine strategic wargame based on the game of thrones universe. 

A little too slow to be a really good game, and the it has some balancing issues. Some houses have a much better chance of winning than others, and if there is a player who doesnt know what he is doing the player(s) around him get an huge advantage over the others. 

My gamegroup where divided on this one, some really like it, others hated all the waiting, I thought it was okay.

This is probably my favorite board game. I will say that it's not completely balanced by default, but people have come up with variants to make the game more fair. Once you're rocking these variants it's a really great game. The next obstacle is finding people willing to play with you (it's a thinking game and can be a little daunting at first) and finding the time to play.

Also, Fantasy Flight Games is a great company with superb customer service.

Only played it a couple times, and had the fortune of playing mostly with people familiar with the series, so getting into character was part of what made it enjoyable.  Solid mechanisms behind it too, but I don't think I'd enjoy it nearly as much with players not knowledgeable about the personalities and houses of Westeros.  Would certainly be willing to play it again, but no compulsion to own a copy for myself.

If you can get 6 people together for 4+ hours, there is nothing short of an orgy that would be more satisfying to do than play thrones.  The main mechanic is stolen from Diplomacy, but the theme and flavor of the additional mechanics make it 100x more fun to play than Kissinger's favorite pastime.  In addition to the war game, you've got bidding, hand management, asymmetrical board positions, strong social play, and a light co-op element.  There's an expansion that makes it playable with 4 players, but you really want 5-6.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really solid skeleton of mechanics. I think that the system is cool. But the experience is marred a bit by just how nasty and sharp the player interaction is. It's a very good game, but I don't love how you have to play. 

I suppose this fits the theme well in the backstabbing, high stakes sense. Minus how much more powerful I think the houses should actually feel in battle (combat resolution is not so thematic). And it is a bit weird that you can hold "the iron throne" without holding King's Landing... actually, everything about the power tokens is thematically very odd.

This was a strange one. The person who brought it didn't quite know the rules, having only played it once several months before, and then not read the rules when she bought it herself. So it's possible that this colors my perception of the game.

But in play, the game felt like the designers kept hitting balance issues when they were playtesting and, to solve that, instituted a wide variety of bizarre, non-thematic choices. I'd say that it felt like an abstract strategy, due to how divorced the rules were from reality, except those generally have clean, simple rules. This had rules coming out of its ears.

Apparently, it was designed as a variant of Diplomacy. But instead of requiring that multiple people attack, in order to win a battle, the designers chose to make battle more like Sumo wrestling, and you just push people back if you attack them with too few troops. This has the side-effect of giving the person you attacked a free movement, to expand onto more territory (which is exactly not the outcome you would expect of winning a battle - even if it wasn't a complete massacre). And in order to prevent you from bringing a lot of troops, they added a rule which basically prevents you from putting your troops together (you can feed an infinite number of troops, unless you put three of them on the same square, and suddenly that breaks the bank).

The end result is, as it is in Diplomacy, you really need to have allies attack with you if you want to win a fight. But that occurs as a side-effect of a byzantine set of rules, rather than simply being made into a straight-forward requirement. It makes it very non-intuitive to play and hard to teach, and more liable for players to end up playing wrong until they've played the games a few times.

Overall, I didn't love it. I feel like you'd do better to toss the combat rules which come in the box, ignore the feeding the troops rule, and play with regular Diplomacy rules for combat. Maybe the rest of the game is fine. I don't remember anything much more about it.

RATING: 7
Tentative rating after one play.

The game seemed flawed, but fun. Very much a "meta" experience kind of game (i.e. the game on the board is a smaller aspect of the experience than the diplomatic game around the table). However, my experience was with an unfocused, and slightly drunken bunch. Needs some work, even at five. Would like to play six, but the opportunity hasn't arisen.

RATING: 4.5
I am a big fan of the Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire series and while I do enjoy the board game overall I wish it did some things better.

For example, I feel that alliances are broken or betrayed as an "inevitability" and not a "possibility" since there is often a last-minute dash for victory. I would prefer it if there was more emphasis on the benefits of an alliance rather than it being just a temporary reprieve before you inevitably get screwed over. 

It would also be nice if they had introduced wedding arrangements or a similar betrothal element since that forms a large part of the reason why certain families are allied to others etc.

In addition, there is some degree imbalance between the different houses which is made pretty dull by the lack of different house abilities. So what tends to happen is people say "Everyone hates the Lannisters in the book - so let's hate the Lannisters in the game" and you're done for.

Battles are more often than not purely decided by a card which kind of sucks.

Suffers from a real "kingmaker" problem and also player elimination. What's worse though is when you are defeated but not eliminated and so have to sit through countless turns until the game is over. Not good at all.

The rule book could have been much clearer with larger text and in general the game lasts too long for what it is. 

You can also screw yourself over by sheer bad luck. For example: I make moves to conquer areas with barrels for Supply but then the Muster card comes up first. Despite the fact that I am rolling in Supply barrels I am shackled to the same low army limit purely because Muster came up before Supply. Also, you can bid like crazy to get ahead following a Clash of Kings but then the same thing can happen on the very next turn meaning you lose everything.

Player interaction is relatively poor. You engage closely with one or two adjacent players but if you're Stark in the North you are unlikely to ever come into contact with Martell in the South.

Finally, if you are losing by the end of the game (largely due to the target on your back as the leader) there is practically no chance to catch up again. So in the end you just have to sit it out as you slowly wait for the end. Monopoly has the same problem and that's not much fun either.

I think "Rex: Final Days of an Empire" scratches a similar itch and does it better, but admittedly the theme of AGoT is probably more accessible to people.

4-6(6)

I don't know ... this one didn't grab me, and it wasn't exactly a huge success with the group. Hopefully it's at least partly a one-off, because the way the deck worked out the four power tracks NEVER got auctioned, which meant that we were all swimming in influence and lot of folks got frustrated by feeling crippled in what they could do.

Still, I just don't think it's my thing. Fiddly with the placing of the orders. There are often times when do almost don't want to place an order (or, rather, it just doesn't matter enough for you to care). It doesn't feel like a whole lot happens. Bash the leader. Etc.

It's quite a different game than "area majority" like El Grande, but I think they hit the same spot and I like El Grande's decisions and pacing a bit better.

Also, the rules are typically FFG. Impossible to reference and read.

RATING: 7
After two plays, I like the improvements from the first edition: more balanced between players. There is some additional mustering from starred consolidate power tokens; and more cards than can optionally provide some more mustering and supply. The improvements could have gone a bit further, I still don't like the random nature of the cards that call up influence bidding, supply, and muster. But there's lot of good stuff here (the secret orders in particular), and it's good fun for an occasional play.

I *really* wanted to like this, but it took us 6+ hours for a 6-player game, and that's way too long for what is about 2-hours worth of fun.  It was 2nd & 3rd play for most (1st for me, but I'd read the rules thoroughly and had a better grasp than most of those at the table), everything just flowed so slowly, even though we tried to keep things going.  I expect the time would drop a fair bit with experience, but I'm not sure how many would be willing to make that investment of more plays to get the time down to something reasonable.

good job! 

compared to the original first edition, this is an improvement from all points of view.

Game play - very good changes from edition one, now the game is rather balanced, more complex, the random factor does not compromise one's strategy. The changes taken from previous expansions makes it a game that is fun to play.

+ Excellent theme and good use of it. The theme keeps the game alive. With better finished mechanics the game could be so much better.
- Back and forth movement on the board
- Spatial constraints. Only with long ship lines the players are able to target others than their neighbors. (Yes, it's part of the theme, but problematic for competitive players.)
- Unnecessary complexity. For example the player cards (hand and discarded) are open information. To compensate the flaw they have introduced special tide of battle cards. Wouldn't it be just simpler to make the player cards hidden information?

Quite a few users claim this is unbalanced with under six; but, if the others band together and stop the faction that is perceived to be the most powerful, this ceases to be a problem.

This definitely is a game in which the leader must be relentlessly pursued until stopped, at which time, the new leader must face the same fate.

Either a) great give and take or b) bash the leader.  It's your call.  My call is great give and take.  Victory is never assured as long as the other players focus.

I like long games and I like games that have a screwage element, so this is right up my alley.

For what it aspires to be, a well designed game.  Lots of interlocking war game mechanics producing lots of interesting options and results.  I am not a huge fan of random card draws determining game outcomes, but I can see that they are used in this game to provide fun surprises and replayability, which perhaps, a long war game benefits from.  Otherwise...ahem...the game would just become a long hard slog with no surprises?  Bottom line:  this is a good multiplayer war game that is also very thematic for those who know the Thrones series.

Juego de control de territorios planificación ciega y subastas. El plus lo tiene en el enganche por la temática, que suma mucho a la diversión. Si se encuentra un grupo de juego que guste de la saga y de los juegos belicos (wargames) tendrás mucha diversión.

Es verdad que el juego puede estár desbalanceado entre las casas dependiendo el número de jugadores que se tengan, pero esto sólo da más variedad al juego, donde sabiendo que un bando tiene ventajas en ciertas situaciones, es deber de los demás detenerlo, las alianzas reales y falsas dan gran juego y no se hace tedioso ni lento una vez pasado unos turnos de la primera partida.

En definitiva, uno de los juegos que más diversión me ha dado, mucha tensión y mucha risa. Me ha divertido mucho más que otros juegos con mejor puntuación aquí. El único inconveniente es que se debe tener un grupo motivado para un juego de dificultad media alta.

Amazing game. Feels a lot like the stories with the amount of alliances being forged and broken turn by turn. Overall it does an excellent job of blending and balancing a number of common mechanics found in many other war games similar to this (the unit production, army formation, and general negotiation that goes on through them). The Westeros cards do a great job of making rounds not feel too static from one another creating spontaneity that each player should prepare for. The house cards are equally interesting to manage as you struggle to decide which leaders to send into battle.

Overall a lot of fun and this edition comes packed with a ton of great components that help to streamline play.

Driving the rating down for return on investment. This can take, and I presume usually does take, an inordinate amount of time to play. There is just so much opportunity for AP. And at the end of the day, what it added over, say, Risk, didn't really add much for me. I'm down with hyper-long games. I'm mostly disappointed because I don't feel the chrome, just changes for changes sake. I want to feel like a Lannister, not think, "well this is different from other map games because of the way you 'muster'..."

A seriously impressive game of area control, treachery, and making alliances to stab other players in the back.

I really want to play this again, but it's got problems. A player can be utterly destroyed surprisingly early in the game, which must feel awful. It also is a nightmare to teach, as you basically need to go over everything before you can get started, otherwise people will get on the wrong foot.

But this is the game of betrayal and vendettas. It does it far better than any other game I've seen, and the commander mechanic for combat is wonderful.

I mean, I don't *hate* it, but while there's one major improvement (The willing attack cards), a couple of minor improvements (the house cards feel a lot more balanced), I severely dislike the "tides of war" deck. I felt one of the major strengths of 1ed was that you had all known information going into any fight. Made for a much more interesting game.

I also really miss the one time orders that let you develop at your own pace.

And I think they took a step backwards on the board art.

A big sprawling game, which applies a (very attractive) Game of Thrones coat of paint to Diplomacy. Retains Diplo's fantastically clever emphasis on victories through alliances and cleverness, rather than tactics. The Influence track mechanism is hugely entertaining and extends the negotiation element of the game. Doesn't really work with less than 6, and can telescope into a very lengthy playtime, but so very entertaining and engaging when firing on all cylinders.

GoT flavored hybrid of Diplomacy and Risk. Tough to get on the table since it's basically a lengthy 5-6 player cutthroat bloodfest with fiddly components and slightly messy rules.

Diplomacy Ameritrashed. On the one hand, you don't exactly need seven players, and it doesn't have to take an entire afternoon to play (in person).

It does add a lot of new fiddly stuff on the basic Diplomacy model, for example bidding for special abilities, cards often randomly disallow certain orders, etc. I guess I would appreciate it if I were a fan of the series, but I'm not, and it just feels like cruft on the elegant engine of Diplomacy.

More problematic is that it's unbalanced at lower player counts. So the game I played had the white guys, the yellow guys and the red guys (again, not a GoT fan). I was the red guys, and I got squeezed out. White took their stuff and didn't much after that, while yellow was able to take the sea square that let them take four castles (out of seven) for the win. Yellow, who owned the game and said that this typical for three and four player games.

Having said that, it was enjoyable enough that I certainly would like to play again, if only at higher player counts.

Perfectly good area-control game. Although not a huge fan of the genre, it integrates nicely the 'Game of Thrones' series elements with the use of cards which also add another element of control to the outcome of a battle without nevertheless throwing the game off balance. Fans of area-control games would most definitely not be disappointed. A few draw-backs: a) the playtime is somewhat long (which you have to know before entering a game, especially with 6 players the few of which might be beginners) and b) the lack of theme is for me one nuisance since I am a fan of the books. Cool game nevertheless, just not one that I see myself playing frequently.

We usually play this at least once or twice a month.  Usually every other week so that friendships aren't ended.  Excellent strategy game, I love the feeling of accomplishment after winning a 6-person game.  Definitely a steep learning curve, but there is a great tutorial on youtube that we have all new players watch.

From its genre (strategy-war-diplomacy) it's one of the better games. The core of this game - hidden orders - create nice sense of tension and uncertainty and unlike in Shogun  there is no eurogame bullshit like scoring buildings but the simple whoever captures 7 castles wins the game, period. I think I prefer the old version graphics, the board was much more clear then. Same for old wooden minis versus new plastic ones.

Playing this weekly on Sundays before GOT Airs.  Great pure strategy game. Have been playing the same house, but would like to mix it up in the near future. Been playing with 3-4 but am looking forward to 5-6 players in the upcoming weeks. Also, haven't tried the game with Tides of Battle Cards, but would like to see how much that random element makes the game change.

What can I say... It's outstanding. If you play with a group of experienced gamers, you will literary fight for your life. It is also great with new players, when you can't predict next move or a cunning strategy of opponent. I have been almost absolutely destroyed in my first game, but it was epic. Simply epic theme, epic mechanism, but you should  wisely choose people for game. Not everyone is prepared for backtabbing.

Better than the first ed. with some needed add-ons from the 1st ed. expansions. I'll repeat that this is a perfectly good area control wgame with a major cutthroat-backstabbing element. I do not like area control games, and I definitely avoid backstabbing games, so I will not play this again. That does not make it a bad game. Just my taste. I rated 9.

I have only gotten to play this once but wow just WOW.  I really felt like I was making back-room deals and betraying my "allies" in Westeros.

This game is just dripping with theme, and the mechanics reinforce the theme beautifully.  Quality is top notch and if you play with the right group there will be so much drama.  I love the various ways you try to gain favor with the highest player on the Iron Throne track whenever there's a tie breaker.  And then the arguments, the shock of betrayal, oh man it's great.

The only issue I noticed was a slight balance issue between houses, but I might be way off base given my only 1 game or maybe it's by design and players need to get creative to overcome that.

All in all this a game I won't ever turn down.

RATING: 7
The second edition of the game is beautifully produced: the artwork is better, the components are better, and the rules included from the expansions of the first edition are well chosen.
The game mantains some of the flaws of the previous incarnation though: it's unbalanced, with some houses struggling more than others to win (Lannister)

Initial Impression: Another wonderful FFG production. Having never read the books and only watched the first season of the tv series, this game is dripping with theme. Player interaction, alliances, backstabbing, interesting mechanisms, this game seems to have it all. The game seems to be best when played with 6 people.

I was skeptical of this game being too long with too much down time.  Like the books! Ha! 

Man was I wrong!  After one play with 6 players it is truly an epic game, but with very easy and interesting mechanics.  It took the better part of 5 hours to teach and play, but time truly flew by.  A must play.

This game took me by surprise.  Knowing nothing about the books or the TV series, I bought this game just after reading the instructions online.  My only real issue with this game is the fact that you really need 4+ players to really make the game soar.  Still fun with 3 players, but it's not as good as it is with more players.

This game has a lot of rules to just shuffle two wooden blocks around a board. When you finally get some reinforcements you might have been playing for two hours already. The idea of giving orders simultaneously is very good, so why does this game still last 6-8 hours? A major flaw in an otherwise good game.

this game is hard to comprehend sometimes. we've played it a few times now and each time we find new rules we seem to have forgotten. one day we might play the game as intended with the correct rules. i think my group needs more negotiation games so that we get better at them and expand our skills as of right now i think we are all terrible at it. and it's difficult to like anyone who plays the lannisters so they get picked on a bit more than the rest

THE game for me!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Preliminary thoughts:
+ Conflict, alliances, treachery, but always with a single victor (prevents the tendency for couples/friends to simply team up because they like each other). 
+ Very innovative and elegant (though complicated) implementation of defeat (retreats/routs/'death'), 'supply and demand' (in this case, supply in the sense of the fixed amount of supply, power, and mustering/victory point icons, and demand in the sense of competition for available resources rather than an actual market mechanism), 'money' (power) and bidding, and even a cooperative aspect (wildlings). 
+ Very thematic, and many of the complex rules actually make sense given what they are meant to represent.
+ Feast for Crows expansion adds some flexibility to the game (different feel, better support for four players).
- Long play time.
- More complex than some might like.
- Confrontational / cut-throat.

I like GOT the boardgame quite a bit. Unfortunately, I have people in my group that just refuse to play this. So, it goes on trade list. Just an FYI to BGG'ers who might want this: the board itself is in 2 pieces. It came that way out of the shrink after I bought it at a local B&N (for $10!).

This is a deep strategic war game but requires patience to set up and to teach the rules. When everyone is comfortable with the rules, Game of Thrones has a great rhythm. I love games with everyone's undivided attention, and people are very focused knowing that they either win the Game of Thrones or die.

The map only balances well with a high player count (see the forum for ideas to balance game play with fewer players). 

I don't know how much this relates to my inexperience, but the influence tracks seemed imbalanced, harming the bidding experience. In one game, I was too low on the King's Court and there wasn't an auction for a long time, leaving me feeling highly dependent on the mercy of others because I was unable to muster and mobilize units. 

If you are introducing the game to new players, I have two recommendations. One is to deflect all questions about the tracks until everyone is comfortable with the core mechanics, as they make a game that really isn't too complicated seem overly complex. My other recommendation is that you download a house cards cheat sheet from the files section and give a copy to everyone.

Amazing game.  Newcomers and veterans alike will love it.  Based on my favorite fantasy series of all time - A Song of Ice and Fire.  Lots of secret texts, alliances, and backstabbing.  Just an amazing, amazing game!  We can play three games in a row easily despite its length.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A good, solid "wargame": building up your resources and then fighting your opponents. I really like the simultaneous orders, but it doesn't have a catch-up mechanism, so if you get beaten in the beginning, might be a looong game ahead without good chances on victory. (I know it is not a real wargame)

Edit: Now owned by me, thanks to Secret Santa 2017! Yey!

Esta segunda edición del juego de Tronos es una amalgama muy bien trenzada  de diversos elementos del juego base y las expansiones. Es la guinda donde se cristaliza el objetivo de hacer el juego más dinámico y fluido. Y lo ha logrado. No cometer crasos errores sigue siendo determinista para alzarse con la victoria. Se mueve por el filo de la navaja en el equilibrio entre el control y el caos. 

El juego está brillantemente decorado y esto hace que respiremos el aroma literario en que está basado por todos los lados. Felicitaciones a Fantasy Flight. Han unido una gran recopilación aquí con todo lo que tenían. Es un juego que difícilmente una ampliación puede aportarle algo excepto complejidad y duración.

Solo lo he jugado a seis donde el equilibrio de poderes es patente. El enigma de la cantidad de jugadores puede ser el problema técnico importante que aún queda por pulir en el juego.

RATING: 9
Like [b]The Resistance[/b], much of my love for this game probably has to do with the fact that I've only played with the full compliment of 6 players, and those players were the best group to share a table with that I've ever known. 

I'd like to play more, but now that I've moved away from my original group, I'm a little wary to join a table full of strangers who may not be able to handle the potential backstabbing.

I've played a large number of games of GoT by now, and this is a game that keeps me coming back for more. True to the theme without being overly complex; full of opportunity for intense diplomacy; a great system for resolving battles... This is one of my favourite epic dudes-on-a-map games. The main drawback is it really works best with exactly six players of roughly equal experience -- newbies tend to get chewed up by a table of old hands, and will gift a win to their neighbour. Oh, and the port rules. F*** the port rules.

I want to like it, but once you hit turn 5 or so, there's a lot to analyze, made worse by the fact that everything is 100% deterministic.  Frequently, the game takes 4 hours and someone wins due to someone else not paying attention, or everyone just calls it quits.

Possibly made better by VASSAL or another program that lets you easily scheme.

The new Ser Loras Tyrell can allow a triple march, if they play it, replenish their hand, and play it again.  ** ACTUALLY THIS IS NOT TRUE, in the new edition you only get back your other 6 cards. **

Loved this initially, but it has lost a bit of its allure to me. It is very long and the downtime can be excrutiating at times. If you ARE in the running for the win it is pretty damn awesome, but if you are not, then the downtime is pretty terrible.

I would rather play the A Feast For Crows expansion than the regular game at this point.

I would still very much recommend this if you are into conflict games and don't mind games running long because it IS a good game.

I give the game on it's own merits a higher score for it's production value, the great characters and locations from the books, and the depth of strategy.

My score of 3.5 in based on the fact that the long, "thick" games do not hold any attraction for me anymore. I grew weary of the pace and method of the game, tried to charge an army of knights into my neighbors to the west and succeeded only in pushing units around the map, and claiming territory is limited. I felt more like I was fighting the limits of the world than fighting other armies. It works, and I could argue it supports the theme. I just didn't enjoy playing the game.

Almost as good as Diplomacy!

EDIT: This is my group's favorite game to play, and I've reduced my rating slightly after many plays. It is like Diplomacy, but a Diplomacy-lite that waters down the game too much to be perfect. 

EDIT: Unlike Diplomacy, where game balance between Great Powers can be entirely mitigated by player skill and negotiation, Game of Thrones has a terrible balance issue with the Lannisters, Greyjoys, and Starks. The Greyjoys wield the executioner's axe over the Lannisters, and while the Starks are a counterweight to the Greyjoys, there is very little incentive for the Starks and Greyjoys to fight, and I've almost never seen it happen. 

The one good thing about the game is that it's 5 player balance is very good if you have one less player than required. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Unbalanced, you can only interact with players adjacent to you, complex mechanics that don't add much to the game except make it feel more random, randomness in general, long despite few rounds and little action. But the genre staples are alright.

A Game of Thrones simply drips with theme: and this is the stuff of any good game. 

It’s so deeply inspired and finely tuned that, while playing, you can almost breathe the same atmosphere and get the same feeling as while reading Martin’s Song of Ice and Fire: during the game, Westeros and both its most loved and hated characters become nearly alive.

By including both expansions to the basic game, this second edition not only improves a little on the previous one but also gets much more enjoyable overall, even though it still suffers from that «Risiko syndrome» that makes it hard for a player who fell behind to catch up with the leader.

Play with a group of friends who read all the (published) books and be prepared to a very long session to fully enjoy.

At the beginning you will love the game, especially if you like the Game of Thrones series. The design is very beautiful and the mechanics are interesting. Then by every game you will realize the disadvantages and the real problems of the gameplay - the worst thing is that the game works the same way every time and doesn't bring anything new. Usually patt situations result, where you can't really do anything, or by doing the same actions you come back to the same results. Mechanics should be changed radically in order to bring some variety in the game. It's interesting that from the beginning the game was far behind in the rating around 300 position, then I guess the fans of GoT series came :) Unfortunately there are much much better games out there, this one doesn't worth more than ~5 games playing. It's a pity.

RATING: 7.5
Risk for grown-ups as I like to refer to it.  It really does make Risk look like child-play.

You are far more limited in how many armies you can have, not just in one space (which I am okay with), but overall on the board in general (one of the parts I don't really like) and there are 'orders' you give your armies that inject a large amount of strategy into the game by impacting each other in cases conflict and helping you generate more funds.  You play a general in each combat that will either modify the combat itself, or possibly hurt your enemy or help you in other ways.

Territories provide various 'resources' you'll need to win.

You bid on 'influence' tracks sometimes (determined by event cards) which will also potentially change your strategies.

Lastly there are random event cards drawn each round that can help or hinder one or more players.

You win the game by either obtaining a certain number of strongholds or whoever has the most points by the end of ten rounds.  

The only major "Con" to this game is some of the scenarios with less players... but do some looking around on the internet for some alternate setups and you'll find solutions to what you might consider problems with them.

Very fun strategy game. This game can be pretty engaging (especially if everyone playing enjoys the series). 

Not super complex after you understand the basic order tokens and condition tracks, but does have deep strategy. Can take some time to play, maybe 3-4 hours, but that is mostly from the diplomacy, token placement, and combat. Otherwise the gameplay can be pretty quick. 

This game is more fun with more players (I would even say balanced for more). Although, a 3 player game we tried was also fun. However, we house ruled most of the board out of bounds.

For 5 players, set up as per 6, remove Greyjoys from play, move Greyjoy garrison to Seaguard, and prohibit access to Pike for the remainder of the game. Seems to work well.

RATING: 8.5
This is the ultimate Game of Thrones experience. Every move is vitally important. This is sort of an offspring of Diplomacy, though simplifies some of the complex mechanics of figuring out what happens during a turn. The fact that there is no luck/dice involved is a highlight for my group. Alliances, though not necessary, are usually vital throughout the game. Play doesn't necessitate knowledge of the books or tv show, but it definitely is a bonus. Only knock is that its a long game and one bad move (or broken alliance) can put someone behind early and they'll have a hard time recovering. This has made some people in my gaming group sour toward trying further plays. Playing with less than 5 really gives the advantage to the southern houses unless Greyjoy/Lannister really pressure Baratheon early on, so definite preferred player count is 6.

A little bit too long. Requires players to play aggresivly otherwise its just boring. We had a game where the first battle happend around 5th round - dont let it happen. Also dont make alliances for the hole game it also brakes it. You should play so ecery move makes you closer to victry. Break any alliance that stands on the way to victory! Its tkat kind of a game ;)

Great improvements over first ed with Wildling deck & Martells. Needs maximum players as 3 or 4 player games are weighted towards Baratheons and Lannisters (even with the defending neutral forces).

RATING: 7
I cannot say that the theme is great because it doesn't translate to the TV Series/books.

The Westeros map is there, the families are there, even the characters, but when you play it seems just another area control game, played by the yellow, red, blue (etc) team.

But the game itself is damn good! Tense, with lot of player confrontation. Prone to alliances that are broken as easily as they were formed. So, kind of a backstabbing game. Each faction has their character cards and that adds to the strategy of the game. 

The components are amazing, the artwork it's very good as well.

Once you play the first turn, you'll find it easier than it looks!

Since all players execute their actions simultaneously, this the the kind of game that gets better with an higher amount of players (6).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The game is mechanically well done. It offers enough strategic options, while still being somewhat streamlined. It also managed to feel thematic and being not gamey.

The player interaction is greatly amplified and guided by the design. You need to switch alliances regularly and want to stop a player falling too far behind, because that usually means someone gets too powerful.
The battles are well done and not too punishing, since you can usually just retreat. There's an interesting guessing and bluffing aspect to battles.
The planning phase also works very well and allows for some exciting bluffs and surprise moves.

I love it, but often 1 or 2 players are out of the title race early, which is clearly a problem. Also the game works best with 6 and takes a while.

Downsides are an imbalanced setup - especially the extreme start for Greyjoy/Lannister - and random supply change and recruit. It's sligthly too random. Stark can be left at 1 supply for a very long time and in general the game accelerates when supply is drawn. If no supply is drawn the game becomes too static.

The same is true for succession. Wether succession is drawn thrice in a row or even never till round 8 will shape the game greatly and not in a good way. Especially if succession is drawn twice/thrice in a row the game becomes too random.

i love this game. The feeling of never knowing who you can trust, and having to wait for just the right moment to go for the win so that the entire board doesn't move against you all at the same time. I also love the song of ice and fire series so the theme just puts it over the top for me.

only cons are the length and the amount of rules. These aren't problems for me personally but they create problems with getting other people to learn how to play and to get enough people to play a full game.

Risk on steroids (but good Christian Petersen type steroids). I was a bit uncertain about the first edition and am glad I waited for this. While there may still be expansions, perhaps they won't seem as much like patches.

First play (five player): Game is excellent, as hoped/expected - five players seemed reasonably balanced with lots of interesting decisions along with the usual wheeling and dealing. Great theme, mechanics, bits, the lot! Well done...

Incidentally, I've got the same "miss-cut" board sections that people were reporting as board "warping." FFG acknowledged the problem and my new board came and it is fine - didn't have to wait unduly long - kudos to FFG customer support.

Subsequent plays have borne out the high opinion I have of this game. Like Rex(Dune) this game needs at least five or six players to make for a good experience - ideally six. Good again on FFG for putting out a better four-player version.

RATING: 9
Another one of my favorite games. This game would be a 10 except it requires in my opinion all 6 players to have a truly balanced game which can be difficult to get everyone to play at times. Overall the pieces, rule book, board are top quality. Really enjoy the hidden aspect of placing orders. Would say that Greyjoy leader cards seem bit too powerful in this game (especially Baleon) but otherwise excellent game.

Good game. Rules are either written with enough fluff that they become overly complicated, or are just not explained well in the first place.  Once you manage to whittle down what the rules actually mean, and have a few games under your belt it starts to get enjoyable.

This could easily be a game you lose friends over, as you're required to be a little underhand, dirty, and back-stabby to either get the seven castles/strongholds, or get the most castles/strongholds by the end of the 10th round to win. Make sure this is played with people who don't mind losing.

Better, than what I recall, of the first edition, but still seems overrated to me. I didn't feel excitement or a strong goal: it might have been playing with the Feast for Crows expansion, but all I had were 1-point objective cards all game of which I could only complete 1 per turn. The person who won did so by completing a 3-pt objective, which would have been fun to go for if I had had the chance. Still an underwhelming game given how strong the reviews here on BGG, but like I said better than the first edition.

I came into this game with very high expectations...which to be honest had me a little worried. Would it be able to live up to what I was hoping for?

The answer is unequivocally yes!

Almost everything about this game is awesome. The art and map really draw you into the world of Westeros. Combat isn't a luckfest like Risk, but still has some guessing and double-guessing uncertainty with the house cards. We played with lots of little slips of paper for Ravens and it was just the right amount of diplomacy and negotiation that I was hoping for, not too drawn out and yet still existent.

Fantasy Flight did a fantastic job with their tutorial video. While it was still a lot for the people learning to take in, it made my job as teacher so much easier! We would pause whenever anyone had a question and I could clarify or explain in further detail.

There were a couple things that keep this from being a 10 at this point

1) There are so many little rules that hold everything together that sometimes people got themselves in situations where they thought they could do something but they couldn't. I know in some ways that's unavoidable, but in a long game like this, there was some frustration around the table. I don't see that being a problem if we played another couple times

2) Some people got themselves into bad situations at the beginning and then were stuck for the rest of the game. Now I know that's their own fault, but it sucked for those people to play for the next 3 hours feeling hopeless

All that being said, I LOVED this game and can't wait to schedule another play of it in. I suspect my rating might go all the way to a 10 after a couple more plays, but don't want to get ahead of myself :)

Good game. If you like the books or TV series, this game is for you. Evokes its theme perfectly. Tons of intrigue, lots of strategy, enough encounters to keep it interesting, and the wildling attacks keep everyone thinking about something besides just which territory they're going to take over. Not my favorite style of game, but this is a very solid iteration. I see why it ranks so high. Worth checking out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Love the novel series, love the tv series, and I love this game.

Found this and thought it was helpful:

Five rules to remember:
1. Special Consolidate Power Order Token can be used to initiate mustering in its area.
2. Only one combat is allowed per march order.
3. The Messenger Raven token allows the holder to also look at the top card of the Wildling deck and place the card at the bottom of the deck if she chooses.
4. Ports with a friendly unit receive a power token (when the GoT Westeros card is resolved), as long as the adjacent sea is not occupied with enemy ships (i.e. blockaded).
5. When you raid a Consolidate Power order not only do you receive a power token, but the player losing the Consolidate Power order has to give up one of their power tokens.

Port Rules:
A Port is considered a sea area (bordering a Castle/Stronghold and a sea area proper) except for the following:

1 No more than three Ships allowed in a Port.

2 A Port belongs to the player owning the connected Castle/Stronghold and can never be attacked directly: Ships can never march into a non-friendly Port. When the Castle/Stronghold is conquered, the new owner can either destroy or take over the Ships in the Port (substituting one or more Ship units in the Port with units of the conqueror's colour).

3 Ships in a Port may not raid nor support land areas.

4 When there are friendly Ships in the Port and no enemy Ships in the connected sea area, the Port provides one Power Token when a "Consolidate Power" order is assigned to it, and when the "Game of Thrones" Westeros card is resolved, but not when the "Dark Wings, Dark Words" Westeros card is resolved.

A very good game on the edge of greatness that doesn't quite reach Top Ten status.

The second edition of AGoT seems to incorporate most of what is best from the first editions and its 2 expansions.

However, some issues that could have been cleared up, weren't fixed. Two such particular issues include:

-the game is best for 6; separate balanced maps for 5 and for 4 could have been developed and included
-better balance for Lannister could have been incorporated

Playtime is highly group dependent. It could be 2 hours. It could be 4. I've experienced both.

RATING: 5.3
Typical bloated FFG release awash with various bits and bobs. The gameplay however is enjoyable and fun and plays as you would expect from a typical multi-player combat game like this. My concern with this game is due to the freedom allowed, gratuitous nature of combat and your ability to hurt an opponent, its largely beyond your control if you win. The tall poppie syndrome means that anyone in the lead or getting close to the victory conditions can easily be cut down and targeted. It basically boils down to who keeps the lowest profile, is attacked the least or can opportunistically pick up areas/castles/strongholds or who the group "lets" win. Ultimately winning or losing feels random and a glorified snakes and ladders or Risk. The game also requires strong situationally aware gamers to keep auto-balancing the game, the players and the leaders as mentioned above. 
All this would be manageable if the game did no take to long to play but the playing time for what it offers is way to long and offers no value.

RATING: 6
All in all a good game, but the setup for 3 and 4 players seems very unbalanced, heavily favoring the player in the south. Other player counts may be unbalanced too but less so. The map is interesting, but even with 6 players, it seems to force the game in a specific direction. The player in the north pretty much has to fight the player on the western island in order to get access to the rest of the map, unless he takes a sea route. The player on the western island knows that and thus those two always end up fighting each other, while the other players fight in the south independently. Maybe more games will show us different strategies, but so far it has been always like that.

Overall it's pretty much impossible to interact with all players, so if someone at the other end of the map is leading, you cannot do anything against them. The best you can do is talking other players into stopping them, if they somehow didn't notice.

I'm also a bit bothered by the king breaking all bidding ties, as ties happen frequently and are often decided almost arbitrarily (if the king doesn't care about the relative placement of two other players.) The king is a kingmaking mechanic. I guess that's intentional though to make they game even more about diplomatics and table talk.

An excellent game with lots of back and forth. Players need to be aggressive both in attempting to achieve their own ends and in pegging other players back. The game suffers from a runaway leader problem, but this isn't so much of an issue as it could be because of the way players can support each other and form alliances to gang-up on those whose power is getting too strong.

I've played once, but it's a pretty simple game that is a lot of fun!

-traded away for Libertalia-

For some reason I get punished everytime I play it. Everybody gangs up on me and I'm so far away from victory, even in the moment we pulled the game out of the shelf everybody is closer to victory than I am.
But I really love the game.
It's a deduction game that puts the necessary fighting so much in the background that you don't think of it as a wargame although you have to take the winning fortresses by fighting. The simple fighting system where you just sum up your troops and aid them with a card is surprisingly refreshing.
I do need to play this more often.

Wonderfully thought provoking, amazingly thematic game. I'd almost call this a "gateway" for war games, not because it's easy to learn (and not because it's necessarily a war game), but because it's so thematic and smart that you'll be left wanting more. In fact this was one game I couldn't stop thinking about after my first play.

The simultaneous placement of orders absolutely makes this game. Whenever I play I can't help giggling as I put down my command tokens, wondering what my opponents are putting down and feeling like something terrible is going to happen. Betrayals are inevitable, which only makes the game more thematic and more fun. The Iron Throne and Messenger Raven tokens are crucial to have, but can cripple you in other ways if you're not careful. Excellent.

I found this game to be just...well...okay. It's pretty complex as board games go, and there are many facets of the game that I'm sure I just didn't understand or fully know how to utilize. The three tier system for advantage is key, and quite confusing, and unless you are SUPER aware of what's going on. In addition, if anybody gets frustrated, or tired, or is called away or otherwise distracted, the integrity of the game is compromised (this happened to me). Only play if everyone present is going to be fully willing and able to see it to completion. Also only play if you have 6 players. Any less, and some houses have distinct advantages due to the lack of conflict around them.

A brutal, more strategic diplomacy with a wonderful theme that is true to its source material.

Be prepared for a lengthy ride though, as it can take several hours to finish.  It also pretty much requires 6 to be well-balanced, and even then Lannister has it rough.  

------------------------

After five plays I still enjoy the game but I find it overstays its welcome.  We haven't been able to finish in less than 4 hours and there simply is too much downtime when playing with plodding strategists.  I find myself wishing we had played a couple of shorter games in the same time frame instead.

One of the best low-luck area control war games I own. A bit too long for the variety it provides. The diplomacy is fun, but I wish there was more. Provides ample opportunity to betray and be betrayed.

It's Diplomacy with a round limit, a sudden win condition, and a lot of chrome. A lot.

However, it does improve on Diplomacy with how orders are determined. Not with a pen and paper, but with tokens. Way, way cleaner.

I finally got to play this game based on the very popular books and tv show. While the game isn’t as good as the show (yes, I know you cannot really compare those), it felt fairly thematic. It was actually a more euro-y game than I expected, which is definitely a plus. The game felt very tense and tight with 6 players (which I understand is by far the best number in this game), and while it was long, perhaps slightly too long, the pace was okay and the game didn’t bog down. It was probably slightly too long with 6, so I’m not sure how often I’m going to play it, but I’m definitely intrigued after my first play. It doesn’t hurt that I won as Stark as well! 

I’m not a fan of blind bidding, and against experienced players it’s hard to know how much to bid on the three tracks (and the track which grants you better actions is fiercely contested!). I like that the board is fairly balanced with castles/strongholds spread out as well as barrels, the latter preventing you from building a huge army, which worked very well. The simultaneous action selection was, as that mechanic usually is, tense and hard to plan for, but it worked pretty smoothly. Your plans can always be messed up by the other players, and you always have to take into consideration the position of the other players. If they are involved in a battle somewhere else, they probably will place those battle markers there, but you’re never sure and might get ambushed… That’s great. 

As Stark I was mainly in combat with two other houses and built up victory points, until I on the first turn of the last round rushed and got two castles in one move iirc. That felt pretty good, but if another player had been before me in the turnorder, he would have won. Overall the game was very tight although the Lannisters didn’t really stand a chance, which I understand is, unfortunately, the consensus here on BGG. Anyway, Game of Thrones is a great tv-show and a decent board game, although it’s slightly too long to get a great rating (but a 7 is a fairly good rating).

Very similar to Diplomacy, although better and faster.  Some of my best gaming experiences have been with A Game of Thrones.

This is just an incredible game!

If you can find people who:

a. Are not afraid to get into conflict with one another in a game setting and

b. Don't take things to personally, 

this might just be the perfect game.

There is a very strong mix of strategic and tactical options in this game. And there are tons of choices, and tons of variety in the choices you make. From deciding how to move troops, or curry influence (both in game and socially), this game delivers on all notes.

[b]Includes the print on demand expansion: A Feast for Crows.[/b]

A Game of Thrones is, along with Dominant Species and Eclipse, one of my favorite "dudes on a map" lengthier games. And after two plays one day after another, I'm incredibly encouraged to keep playing this game.

Unlike those other two titles, AGoT is actually best with six. It brings an element of diplomacy and negotiation to the table that the other games do not. Which, if you're a fan of the novels or the HBO show will strike you as wonderfully thematic. 

I've always been a little suspicious of Fantasy Flight's big sprawling games, but this is an incredibly tight design. Every rule is there for a reason, right down to the wildling attacks that everyone must confront and the bidding for turn order, military tiebreakers, and those crucial special orders. 

Love it, love it, love it.

I played a 6-player, shorter version of this game. I don't know what the expansion was, but it had us all up in each others' grills right out of the gate. It was certainly fun. And it played pretty fast and furious. I like the secret orders revealed simultaneously. But ultimately, it didn't feel like it had the rich strategic/relationship space of Diplomacy. But it works in 1/3 the time, so that was good. But it never felt like anyone really could break out. And there were no alliances that felt like they were anything but matters of convenience.

First of all, this game is AWESOME, however it is a very difficult game to learn then master as there are A LOT of moving parts, none of which can be ignored.  It mimics the spirit of the series without re-hashing the stories, there is A LOT of treachery and backstabbing as well as diplomacy (the game's mechanics resemble that Avalon Hill classic).  It plays best with 6 players and will take at least three playing to fully understand all the mechanics and start to for strategies, it is worth the time invested.

RATING: 8
Simultaneously revealing orders and resolving the orders one at a time is a great system of play. The only downtime is waiting for others to decide and waiting for others to resolve combat. Unfortunately, the downtime from the former can be immense, as this game is highly prone to AP.

The combat system is simply stunning. Checking support allows plenty of alliances and backstabbing, and the simultaneous card reveals introduce interesting mindgames. Also, the area control aspect is quite tight, as you only get a few armies and a limited amount of turns. This makes each decision important.

AGoT:TBG is best played with 4 or more. 3 is ok, but there are too few interesting turns and interactions.

This game provides satisfaction about on par with Risk Legacy, but at a significantly longer game length, and for the length of gameplay, it doesn't quite provide the depth and satisfaction that War of the Ring provides. So while I really enjoy this game, it has nearly been replaced by these games in my mind. Still, those who love the franchise will like this game.

An interesting game of conflict and warfare with some neat mechanics. Well suited for 5-6 players, but I wouldn't play it with anything fewer than that. I'd advice people to look at the Living Card Game instead if you're looking for something to play with only 3-4 players, even though they play quite different (naturally), but still - I believe that you'll get the most out of this game if you can gather a full group and if that's not going to happen, then pick up the card game instead.

Good mix of careful planning and risk-management, very flavorful, makes for suspenseful games, mechanisms work well, great strategic variety.
But: Rules are terrible to teach and deterring to new players, mechanisms favor turtling over attacking, vanilla game is imbalanced, especially for less than six plaxers, depending on the game group, kingmaking may be an issue.

Seconda edizione con poche novità e quasi tutti i difetti della prima . In partite da 5 giocatori Baratheon e Tyrell hanno accesso facilmente a castelli/fortezze prendendole dai neutrali . Molto complicata/improponibile la posizione di Lannister . Probabilmente è un gioco per soli 6 giocatori . Sul fronte componentistica , bella mappa e buona dotazione ( come sempre d'altronde nei giochi FFG ) , tuttavia , a più persone è capitato di scambiare i cavalieri con la macchina d'assedio ( forma simile ) . Dovendo valutare una seconda edizione , fatico a pensare che sia denaro ben speso .

This is basically the old game Diplomacy updated and stylized from the George R.R. Martin book series of the same name.  It adds features like fending off wildlings and a bidding system, as well as measures to keep the duration down to 2-3 hours but at it's heart it is still Diplomacy.  

As with Diplomacy, you should be careful with who you play this game with.  It's a game of bluffing and deception and some people have a hard time dealing with that.

A very enjoyable game that I might have enjoyed more if I wasn't sleep-deprived. Rating may (and probably will) go up after more plays.

I played it again after a year or so with six players instead of three and it was a dreadful experience. The downtime is utterly painful, and the idea that you can't choose when you reap the rewards of the barrels you spent so much time working towards is one of the worst offenses I've ever seen in game design. I will never judge a game again when under the effects of sleep-dep, and will probably never play this again.

"Winter is coming..."

"Whenever you play the game of thrones, you either win or die."

This board games captures the essence of the Song of Ice and Fire series masterfully. While it reminds me of an old classic 'Diplomacy' in some areas, it expands on it in so many ways to create a deep, rich dive into westeros. 

Beautiful artwork brings larger than life personalities to life without spoilers for anyone who has yet to enjoy the books. 

Do try not to take it personally when you're stabbed in the back...

A good game, however very long. A lot going on, and the first play really dragged with a fair amount of down time. First game we also played with some significant rule fails regarding casualaties and march orders. Really need to play again at some point to reassess it. 

Jan 15 - played again (as well as once online) - came last due mainly to some serious tactical errors. Attacked someone where I couldn't have won and overextended early into enemy territory. Still a lot of fun and this is a great game and deserves a high rating. Very tactical with many things to balance.

[b][i]Finally[/i][/b] played my copy. My 2nd copy. My first copy I sold in shrink. And I'm talking about 2nd copy of 2nd edition. First edition I sold with first two expansions. I keep selling it, but then thinking about it and rebuying it. I only played first edition + 1st expansion a couple times, and 2nd expansion once. I forget the details. I definitely like having a more complete base game in revised edition. 

This is a really hard game to rate. I have fond memories of the original edition, even though I didn't play much. The game goes reeeaaaally slowly with players who aren't familiar with it, and it's hard for me to get the game to the table enough, and with the same players, to get a group of primed players. You really need to know all the combat cards of each house. Otherwise you need to look at each others' cards all the time, or else just take the chaos of not knowing what they have. That's what we did tonight, and it still took us 3 hours to make it through half the game before we called it, as some players were running out of stamina. 

Anyway, this fired Diplomacy for me. I like the planning aspect, without having to be hyper literal in what every unit does. I love things like the Influence tracks and the supply system. I like how everyone plans at the same time. That seems like it should keep things moving, but in reality there's still a fair bit of thinking when resolving actions, and especially choosing a combat card.

Basically, I'd rate this game higher if I could somehow get it played more often and get the play time down. They're interrelated, of course. But I think I'll always have a soft spot for this game, even though it could be another decade before I play again.

A very interesting, strategic and exciting game to play, and one of the few that my wife will always say yes to playing, but also one that she often regrets doing so.

Pros:
Really captures the feel of game of thrones with intrigue, alliances and betrayals
Nice quality pieces, and nice rules for bidding, supporting, attacking.
The combat cards add cool flavor, and adds a nice bluffing element

Cons:
As many others mentioned, very long. Too long. It is a shame, as it feels like you are building towards something great, and would like more turns, but everything takes time, the calculations, decision paralysis, bidding, etc.
Some fiddly rules with ports, multiple moves, the whole Westeros deck (probably should have found a cleaner way of doing this)
Supply reconciliation is annoying and unwieldy, and keeping track of how many armies you have is the same.

Still a top strategy game, and one I love to play with the family!

The limited amount of different actions (attack, support, defend) that you can pick each round help limit a run away winner.  I think it would play better with the optional deck that add a random modifier to combat.  Without that you look at there cards and they look at yours and you figure out what number card you each have left.  It makes combat a little too deterministic and less climatic.  The cards are a nice way of doing combat (like Kemet) but adding in some element of chance would make it more fun.

After 5 plays in the last two weeks i feel that i can finally rate this game. I love the clever mechanics if the hidden betting and the hidden orders. My gamegroup is really fun to play with as alliances is made and broken constantly during the game and everyone sits deeply burried in though with the occasional paranoid stare at their opponent. There is some downsides though. My main issue is the balance. The games ive played are four player games and the balance is somewhat of. We have houseruled some of the inbalance but it still isnt quite there. The main problem being Greyjoys position. He must accept that he has to leave Stark and lannister alone so they can deal with baratheon and then sit and wait for most of the game before trying anything. Maybe this will  change as we get more experienced as has some of the other things we found unbalanced. This is my main concern and a pretty big one. Im looking forward to playing a full game. The game also has a tendency to drag a bit, although this is not a big concern for me it can be with a few players prone to AP. All in all, a really good game with fun mechanics and a lot of diplomacy and interaction.

Brings in the theme of favorite show into the gaming world.
The predictable battle mechanic is probably the weakest part of the game.
If played without optional combat cards, it's not worth playing at all.
Negotiations and backstabs are fun.
Generally feels fun, might do better with more territories and more strategic progression.
Unpredictability of wildling attacks and card resource draw is probably a highlight too.

I've played this game and I didn't like it because of 2 things

1.The Westeros card have too much of an effect in the game.You might have developed a good strategy to create big armies,but there is no muster card around so all your plans go to waste.

2.The informal alliances.I like diplomacy,table talk and alliances,but it should have been implemented in the game mechanics.Having rules upon entering an alliance or exiting and the positive and negative effects should be represented with ingame mechanics.The pseudo-alliance thing makes the game feel clunky and not tight at all.

In general the game felt more of like:"Hey,we have the GoT theme.Let's figure out some mechanics so we can get it going" instead of:"Hey,we have some good mechanics here,we could try implementing the GoT theme on top of it"

The unit pieces look ugly as hell also,but this was the least of my complaints with the game

RATING: 5
Me parece un risk vitaminado...
Aunque no tenga dados, el azar sigue muy presente, pues dependes totalmente de lo que salga en las cartas de evento. El combate mola mil, la verdad, pero flojea en todo lo demás. Las alianzas no tienen ningún sentido, todos los jugadores van a conquista, así que no se puede pactar casi nada. Si hubiera más caminos hacia la victoria, eso sí que seria posible, pero tal y como está... meh. Para fans de la saga, y poco más.

Rating after one play...I must say I enjoyed it a lot, it really is a nice strategy/political driven game. there is a lot of player interaction in this game(fighting, bidding for influence and especially alliance negociations) and you really need to plan your orders carefully and pay close attention to board movement.

I like the new random element cards in combat(that allow for the different conditions that effect combat, like terrain, weather, unit discpline and so on) but I think the +3 card is a bit much, it can shift combat a little drastically.

This game is what kicked me into the boardgame hobby. I didn't know anything about the Game of Thrones universe, and most strategic board games wound down to rolling dice which I detest.
And then a friend bought this game and wow... did this blow my mind with how strategic, tactile and diplomatic it was.
Absolutely awesome, but be prepared to stab your friends in the back.

RATING: 7.5
Ruthless.  Still not sure anyone really knows what to do with ports though.  To lighten up tension when we play, every time a fight occurs we play the song "The Gonk" from Dawn of the Dead until the fight has concluded.  If anyone says "The Lannisters always pay their debts" whilst playing they are chased from the room (again - to "The Gonk").  If playing as the Starks a thick northern accent has to be disregarded in favor a really poor Vito Corleone impression.  House Tyrell should only be referred to as "The Green Team" and House Harkonnen are not in the game but should be.

RATING: 9
Great narrative. Mechanically elegant with its complete lack of dice and chance. This game is entirely about playing the other man and sound decisions strategically with bidding and tactically with movement and attack card play. Brilliant design. A bit on the long side to play out - but the designers wisely limited the number of turns till victory points are counted.

# of players and breakdown on experience/funness: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/908561/number-players-breakdown

Rating as of Jan '15 - 6.5. Owned since June '14 and only played 3 times at the time of this rating. I like this game a lot better with the Feast for Crows expansion since my main gaming group is 4 players. I also prefer the Tides of Battle cards because I like a little randomness with my battles. With the base game, I feel like it's a lot of back and forth with the nearest castles. However with the Feast for Crows expansion, then it's about secret castles that you don't where they're going for. My core group don't trust each other in any game, so we don't make as many deals as we ought to. I feel like I'm missing half of the game. I might rate this higher after a bunch more plays. I watched the TV show, but haven't read the book. It's super thematic, but with euro mechanics, which is what I like.

We don't have any similar war game in my collection as an alternative unless you count Small World which is a way lighter affair.

Things I like about aGoT: Very thematic with the house victory conditions in the Feast for Crows expansion. I kinda feel like an army general complaining about how I'm constantly short on supplies. Beautiful artwork and components. House guests get excited when they see the game in my collection.

Things I don't like about aGoT: it takes a loooong time to teach this game to new players. My core gaming group won't make deals with each other. Game length means that we have to schedule playing this game in advance. There can be some un-engaging downtime if you don't care about other people's battles.

This game truly is the definitive Game of Thrones experience in a box.  No dice-rolling here all combat is deterministic and a mix of your units on the board and the cards you play from your hand.  The game is drenched in diplomacy, back-stabbing, and intrigue making it truly feel like you're participating in the politics of Westeros.  
I would rate this game a 9 or higher but I take points off because you truly do need the full 6 players to get the real experience.  Excellent game, however.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.1
Epic fantasy war game in the Game of Thrones setting. Becoming king of Westeros requires careful planning and positioning on the three influence tracks. The outcome of battles is uncertain due to the House Cards and the Tides of Battle cards. This clearly increases the excitement when going into battle. The game succeeds in having the players live the theme. It also looks very nice and contains high quality game pieces. One minor negative element? The difference between the playing pieces representing footmen, knights and siege engines could have been made more outspoken. From some angles it is difficult to distinguish between them. But hey, don't let that detail spoil your fun...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is my favorite board game.
The strategic variability on this game and level of engagement from beginning to end is on par with chess, with social political intrigue thrown in, resulting in a truly epic gaming experience. It's the ultimate hindsight game, because you always take full accountability on why you lost (or won) the game, ultimately thinking back to a series of pivotal moves that cost you the game. 
Production values are also fantastic, and for what you get it retails at a very reasonable price compared to some other board games out there.
I will say that this game isn't for everyone though, my girlfriend for instance is turned off by the level of complexity and engagement the game requires. However, those who enjoy strategic games absolutely love it. 
Also, although the game says it plays 3-6 players, playing 6 players is an absolute must - which is the reason why we don't get to play this game as often as we'd like.

RATING: 7
Good game, albeit the at times seemingly unnecessary complexity creates too many surprises to really plan for the long run.

Whilst a great twist on Diplomacy (I wouldn't say an upgrade, but for me it is) it suffers from similar problems; that there is little to no coming back if you fall behind. Worse, you stay in the game until it's over (which can be a long time) whilst pretty much just watching the others play. And the downtime can become a real headache if you're not involved.

tl;dr: A great game if you are ahead, a horrible game if you're behind

(I'm probably going to update my ratings, I did only play it twice as of now)

Definitely an improvement over the first edition, with the addition of ports, garrisons and siege towers.

The theme is great, but the mechanics themselves are somewhat middling. In some ways feels like a poor man's [i]Diplomacy[/i], though it's much shorter of course. Plus, I think Lannister probably needs a 1 VP handicap.

In any case, with a multiplayer game like this it really comes down to the people you're playing with, and how much everyone is into the fiction. Good for a play from time to time, but not a go-to game.

I like it but it has it's shortcomings. For one, the board needs to be bigger to see all the symbols better with troops on the board, plus better recognize all the Sea and land connections between regions.

The central action-chip play is my favorite aspect of the game, and creates some great double-guessing of what your opponent is going to do.  The map is tight and quickly forces interaction and/or deal making.  The cards add uncertainty but can suck if you start the game low on the tracks and all the voting cards come late in the deck.

This game really needs no review. Buy it. It rivals Star Wars Rebellion in thematic gameplay. It does play best with six players. It plays good with five players, but I would not recommend playing the base game with less than five players unless you have the 4-player expansion game. The political intrigue, backstabbing, and high-stakes tension this game creates between players is unmatched by any other game I've played with similar mechanics. It literally had my buddies and I running off into side rooms of the house behind closed doors to wheel and deal in between turns like we were Tyrion and Vanereys scheming in the gardens of Kings Landing.

I really love this game and the strategy and diplomacy required in this game. The only reason I have it rated a 9, make that 8 instead of a 10, however, is because of how poor the balance for Lannister is. Greyjoy can pretty much unilaterally wipe Lannister off the map if he so chooses, and this makes playing Lannister no fun at all if Greyjoy chooses this option.

Rating dropped to an 8. The Lannister position really bothers me.

I have only played this once, and we didn't finish after 4 hours, but it was a great experience.  It's an unexpectedly clean design that is reminiscent of RuneWars, but much better. 

A Game of Thrones is a Diplomacy-like war game.  It increases the complexity significantly by adding several new elements, but it also reduces the complexity of order resolution by adding a turn order element.

I am looking forward to playing again.

lazy design. all balancing is done through the kingmaking (so called negotiation) aspect of the game. Houses seem imbalanced, forcing you to negotiate. Also suffers from runaway leader (compare the options of someone with just 1 unit on the map to those of someone with 8+ units on the map... who will get power more easily? who will get units more easily?). Again, this is only balanced by kingmaking. 

If you don't mind kingmaking, the game might be good for you. I don't like kingmaking at all.

Some bad iconography choices (does the sword represent killing off a unit or does it represent +1 in combat? -- in this game, it depends, where the SAME EXACT sword appears (sword token vs. combat cards) *argh*) and tacked-on-feeling rules (ports. They serve a sole purpose that's not even very easily explained thematically. Why is it that I gain power through them rather than barrels?) make me feel very doubtful about this game.

Also, this should never have been marketed as playable by 3 (there's a reason why this is not recommended with 3 players by the BGG community).

A very good implementation of theme and the the game itself has some good ideas. The play experience is let down a little by the fact that the game needs 6 players for balance but at that player count it is a crowded board so it is likely that in any game at least one player will get 'squeezed' from quite early on and will therefore not have a good game experience. That is a problem for a game that runs long.

If looking for a multi-player conflict game I would tend to look to Eclipse or Kemet before I looked here - unless I was hosting AGoT fans.

I don't know what I like more, playing the game, or reading the strategies for each of the sides. The politics, the unique starting conditions, the varied house cards, all help to add a great flavor to a light wargame. Sure, sometimes bad luck can really throw a wrench in your plans, but when isn't that true in any game? I've become fairly convinced that I only like this game as a six player venture (making it hard to get to the table), but I've always had a positive experience with it.

RATING: 9.5
Tense, brutal and woefully unforgiving to even the smallest mistakes - my favourite game to date. Love the theme and mechanics of it. I enjoy how this game isn't one where the mechanically skilled players' advantages (through experience/exposure) aren't as game crushing as in most games -  less experienced players have almost as good a chance to win if they are adept in diplomacy and skilful with negotiations. Leads to re-playability being high and fresh with different groups of people. Only issue is that the delay between turns can take an age. Adding a timer only helps so much.

Variable player power; Wargame; Area control; Non-dice combat; Fixed starting positions; Simultaneous Action Selection;

Based in the land of Westeros, the 6 houses of Westeros fight for the Iron Throne. Players try to gain control of areas which gives them varying resources, to upgrade armies and gain political powers, and expand their territories.

Heavy strategy game with fairly somewhat similar storyline for each gameplay, although final winner varies.

This edition suffers from the same deep flaws as the first edition. The addition of ports did fix the navy blockade which prevents building of boats, but otherwise game is effectively the same. Ten turns of chaotic events and blind bidding, no real strategy in this one, and it is slow, long procedural time waster. Avoid.

RATING: 8
Few negatives, long, few fiddly rules, your experience will be very dependent on your group, and playing the game I could think of a few ways in which the game could be streamlined. Saying that the game play is excellent, better at the higher player count if people like to negoatiate, though I'd say it's also good at the lower count also. Thematic in terms of its mechanics, you'll cajole, strong arm, threaten and appease to further your agenda, maintain the status quo or destabilise the power balance, particularly when someone gets ahead, it's game of thrones! If that's not your thing you have a decent ( negative caveats already mentioned) war game, that people not familiar with the source material and not into negotiation can enjoy. Not really like anything in my collection. Plays best at 6, that alone separates it some from the pack. Ports rule though, kill me now!

Second favourite game. Love the hidden assignment of orders and the shocking revealing of those. Love the bidding on influence tracks and wildling attacks. Love the fights, which are somewhat like rock-paper-scissors mindgame, which can sometimes take the opponents like 10 minutes or so to figure out what kind of card they want to play. Love the promises, the alliances, the backstabbings, the treasons. Love, love, love this game. 
Only sad thing is, that I've never played it with 6, and just once with 5. A six player game is a thing that needs to happen!

I Change my mind about this game so often, the game play is very similar to diplomacy.Anyone that has watched or read game of thrones will know the series basically revolves around screwing other a number of people to get from point A to point B, I have found this game doesn't really embrace this theme very well. 

That being said the game has still managed to cause at least one table flip, and one player being reduced to tears twice due to double crosses and other bluffs... 

Not a game to be played with anyone other than your close (Stable) friends

The box might as well say "6 Players Only" because it scales horrendously.  Even with 6, I have no idea how this game is rated so highly.  The Westeros deck is just a mess that can single-handedly ruin a playthrough.  The Wildling deck is completely unnecessary.  Mustering (adding) units won't happen often enough to make attacking appealing.  In order for this game to be any fun, you MUST have 6 uber-aggressive players that have an "all-or-nothing" approach and prefer to play one bad 4-hour game over any combination of far better and shorter games.  Huge disappointment.

Firstly: You do not need to know anything about Game of Thrones to enjoy this board game (when I first played it, I was only vaguely aware of the series and have since become an avid fan of the book series.)

Moving on, what an excellent expansion to concepts explored in Diplomacy, and the perfect setting for them too. Betrayals are always poignant. Underdog victories are magnificent. Mechanically, the cards that dictate combat are a ton of fun, along with the constant threat of the Wildlings.

Fan or no, you've got to play this game at least once.

(Up from 6 1st ed)
The 2nd ed includes a lot of elements from the previous version's expansions, which patch things up quite a bit.  Ports mean that you can't be screwed out of the sea battle entirely, and siege engines are a double-edged sword but great for taking heavily-defended castles.  The ability to play with 6 natively is also nice.  The battle cards that destroy the awful forgone-conclusion combats are something I very much want to try, but haven't convinced people to use them yet.
Anyway, it's better on nearly all fronts, but still not something I want to play all the time.

After One game: I like the mechanics of the game a lot, but it took us 6 hours (not including 75 min instructions) to play an 8 round 7 player game. Despite liking the game, I doubt I'll play it again due to the length of play.

If everyone knows how to play I bet it's a great game that could be played in the suggested time. But my game was plagued by poor instructions, an AP player, and another player that didn't get basic gameplay down u til the 3rd round.

I give it a 7.5 based on recognizing it's a good game, but for me I'm going with a 6.
Edit: I keep thinking about this game, the last time that happened was Dune...my favorite game, so it's getting an uptick.

In this version all bugs of the first Game of Thrones are fixed and the game is much largely balanced and all houses are included. Artwork remained pre-series one, and I prefer it that way.
It's great risk-like strategy game without risk. Every move can be calculated but still a lot of suspense is in the decisions when choosing orders for your armies. You can also include some randomness in combat through Tides of Battle cards as a variant for those who prefer risk and gambling. It's 6 player game, with options for less than that. I love it.
Perfect for GOT fans.
Major drawback: very long playtime with large number of players, which is at the same time best way to play it.

At one time my favourite game. It is a king of the hill game. Which erks me a little. Sneaking from 3rd place to first in the last turn or so is the best strategy.

What i really love about it is reading out the tactical situations. The turn tracks, cards, unit abilties, map board, and diplomacy all fit together really well.

The rules are fairly complex, but i play quite often and have managed to teach an entire group of non gamers to play it in under 30mins.

I can see why my friends thought I would like this game.  I do, but I still think Warrior Knights is better.

Areas where GOT is better:
1-The generals/characters are flavorful/more varied, WK's are more limited in the mercenary deck (assuming you use expansion), and generals are identical for each color

2-Slightly better combat system, especially if you use the tides of war deck

3-Flavorful and easily managed supply lines dynamic

4-Never read the books/seen the show, but if I had I'm assuming I'd find it more immersive than WK's relatively generic atmosphere.

WK strengths
1-The map-I don't like how rectangular/elongated the GOT map is.  It makes me not really care about what people are doing on the other end (for example if I'm Stark, I only care about 2-3 other players).  

2-I like the win condition better in WK--I think it's dumb that strongholds/castles (whatever they're called) offer no defensive benefit.  WK *feels* like you're gaining influence over time towards being named king.

3-The specialized roles-WK WAY better.  GOT's too often only involve the player who has them.  WKs routinely affect the whole game, e.g. the Pope getting his butt kissed by other players to avoid negative events, the chairman wieding immense power at assembly, etc.

4-Having to pay your soldiers is a good balance check, I guess it could be seen as equivalent to GOT's supply lines.

I think they're even in the turn orders, and the passage of time/generic events within each turn.

I am a sucker for the theme. My favorite part of this game is when moments from the show potentially carry over to the game. (example a friend was playing Greyjoy and early in the game attempted to take and hold Winterfell from the Stark player like Theon did in the show). It is annoying to teach and learn, but after a few plays mechanically it's pretty sound. I like the auctioning aspect to determine your position on the three tracks. Its a solid game.

A really good war game. the fans would love it. you play the different houses in westeros. mustering and leading your forces in battle to get control over 7 stronholds or castles to win. influence and supply are important as you want to hold a good position on the board and advantage by holding either of the valyrian sword, throne or the raven. Playing your house cards wisely in battle is also part of the strategy. the westeros cards (events) guide the story and sometimes you can get attacked by the windings.. enjoy it as this is the only cooperative aspect of the game. other than that it is a lot about alliances, lies, deception, back stabbing ... be always careful :) A Must!

Played 6-player game that took about 6,5 hours + explaining the rules... o.O But half of us had never played the game AND we had some ap-prone players so it made it last. I was curious to play it at least once because I watched the first season and liked it very much. Ok, there was little bit too much war for me, I'm not interested in typical war games at all. But there was some good things also, controlling the resources, bidding, simultaneous action selection... And if you like the tv-series, it brings additional value to the game.

I'm always cautious of games built around branded-IP and this game is a quintessential example as to why. The limited numbers of forces each player can control makes the game feel over balanced, and the fighting is unbearably swingy. The bidding for track order is interesting, but not enough to lift the otherwise stale and lengthy gameplay out of the muck. I'd recommend Blood Rage over this every day of the week, as the mechanics are fairly similar, except Blood Rage manages to create an enjoyable experience out of them. Players with a love for negotiation might find something here, just never ask me to play.

Strong strategy game. It was my first big board game I ever played. I took me a while to understand all the rules and to be able to explain them. I'm not sure if I would still have a hard time with this right now.

My friends and I love this game. Sometimes it's annoying that later on in the game you have so much to look at, that you need way more thinking time than the others. This can be a little annoying for those who don't have so many units as you.

The game takes a while to play, but the mindgames you can play are really cool.

RATING: 9
Just wonderful, with 3 players or more.

The concept is crudely the same that it was in Diplomacy: You have forces in your territory, then you order them to move from your territory to either attack, take hold of an unoccupied territory or move your army to defend your own area.

This is a "dice-free" game, so luck is not a factor here (unless you use the optional "Tide of Battle" cards). You have armies, comprising of infantry, knights, siege engines and ships. Above all that, you have Characters, which can give an impact to the battle itself or have some other function in some circumstances.

The beauty of this game does not lie in battles, though. Unlike in Diplomacy for example, once you have agreed to something with somebody, it's never binding; you can call off your forces right after your "ally" has entered into battle and trusts in your support!

While any multi-faction wargame of this type is going to suffer certain problems, alliances and sudden but inevitable betrayals can make an interesting game in and of themselves. There's enough meat here that it doesn't devolve into anything as bad as Cosmic Encounter. 

Ports and Wildling Attacks feel mostly unnecessary (if ports merely served as staging grounds for mustering ships when sea zones are occupied by opponents, they'd be more easily explained). 

The game certainly grows with multiple plays and leads to interesting post-session discussions.

RATING: 6.75
Rating based on one 5 player game.  Loved the show so was excited to try this game.  Setup took a long time, as did looking over the rules.  We watched a video online on how to play which helped but we were constantly having to go back to the rules and some aspects like the ships/ports we just had to guess on.  The game itself took nearly 4 hours mostly due to our slow start and checking rules but the gameplay itself was pretty enjoyable once we got into it.  Most everyone was in it all the way till the end but since we had 5 players there was an open area that I felt was an advantage to the players closest to that area.  Its too easy to take over unclaimed areas.  I did like the influence tracks and the house cards and I thought the combat system was generally fair.  Teaming up with people is fun as well.  I just wish the game scaled better for more people, like maybe less rounds or less castles to have to conquer.  Also the house cards seem like they should be a bigger part of the game beyond combat.  I think with some rules tweaks this could score much much higher.  I'd like to play it again with 6 people at least.

A great game. It plays a lot like Diplomacy but with a few twists and some flavor from the series. Speaking as a fan of ASOIAF, it captures little elements that feel right: the Greyjoys and Martells are the most aggressive and frightening, the Tyrells can build huge armies and the Lannisters and Baratheons end up brawling in the early game.

game is well designed when playing with the maximum 6 players, things however get awry the you drop. 4 players is unplayable if you follow the rules. while this can be addressed by heavy house ruling or through an expansion, i think balance for a permitted number of players should really come out of the (base) box

A 6-player game that is better than the previous edition. The added kicker card in combat reminds me of the die roll in Washington's War for the strategy rating. The House cards are themed really well for each side.

A long game worth the occasional few play, but still not a game I would play regularly.

After additional plays, I don't enjoy the scripted attack patterns and the sense that Greyjoy is far too powerful if the Stark player does not confront early.

Good games give you a tension of, "I have so many things I *need* to do, but I don't have enough actions to do all I want to do!" Game of Thrones gives you, "I *have* to do X number of things? Half of the orders I'm giving are useless, so how to choose among them?" This is not a good thing.

Another case of an incredibly immerse game that goes a bit overboard in the time commitment and mechanics department; aka, a Fantasy Flight production.  The quality of the board, pieces, and artwork is fantastic, and each of the various Houses feels rather distinct, through their vastly different starting positions and unique character cards.

The purpose of the game is to have your House conquer seven strongholds on the continent of Westeros, while denying that opportunity to the other two to five other players on the increasingly crowded and war ravaged board.  The level of shifting alliances and backstabbery is quite good, which is very thematic to the story the game is based on.  And while a thorough understanding of the Song of Ice and Fire series improves the game, it definitely is not necessary to enjoy or win.

However, I feel that this game, far more than any other, including other marathon games like Arkham Horror or Merchants & Marauders, tends to drag immensely at times, and with little to do between carrying out orders, the game can easily crawl to a near standstill, making some turns far longer than necessary. And even after four complete games, it still comes off as fairly opaque strategically at times and incredibly difficult to master; while the luck factor is fairly low (no dice rolls, and few card drawing here), there doesn't always seem to be any rhyme or reason as to why one player suddenly reverses fortunes and pulls into the lead, or why other empires suddenly go into sharp decline.

Still, a good grand strategy game to play with friends who have patience and an afternoon to kill, especially to fans of war games a bit more involved than Risk, and of course of George R R Martin's epic saga.

Since I am a fan of the books, I really dig this theme. I love to play it with people, who are also familiar with A Song of Ice and Fire world because it really adds to the game if you can bring certain parallels from the book based on the current actions etc. The gameplay is very unique, especially the betting part on the three tracks. Love this game, but I gave it a 6 since it is quite long so I just can't play it whenever and there could be a little more variation in where the players start.

After a couple of plays of this there isn't as much here as I would like.  Because you can only support a few armies, it takes way too long to end up doing a lot outside of your starting area, which means that you'll probably hit the 10 turn limit.

If you do engage in battles, it is in your interest to do a lot of them to cycle through your deck.  If you aren't contested and don't do a lot then your first couple of battles you should win simply because you have your 4 and 3 value house cards available.

There's a lot to discover in this game. Quite mechanic heavy, but so true to the theme. Playing the different houses with a different number of players makes this interesting. We still prefer Imperial, but this one is solid.

Fantástico juego que recrea con una simplicidad enorme las batallas y políticas que se reflejan en los libros de la serie Canción de Hielo y Fuego de George R.R. Martin.
Obviamente, siendo un eurogame o amerithrash, no puede descender hasta el detalle de la simulación de los ejércitos, de los lideres, de los asedios, etc..., pero con sus limitadas reglas y piezas, es capaz de crear un tenso ambiente de juego, con victorias muy ajustadas y traiciones / gestas memorables.
Además, la suerte interviene de manera muy limitada, pues todo es pura matemática (a no ser que apliques la regla opcional de avatares de la guerra) y se premia por tanto la mejor estrategía.
Muy recomendable, con el único handicap de ser necesarios 6 jugadores para que la partida alcance todo su esplendor.

Excellent wargame more than a little reminiscent of Diplomacy, but fixes almost everything wrong with the earlier game. Knowledge of the source material isn't necessary and the theme shouldn't put anyone off who hates GoT (the game stands well enough on its own feet), but I do wish they would release a reinterpretation of this with a historic theme. I really love this but it loses points because it really needs a lot of (invested) players and a lot of time to work.

This game delivers an amazing war experience that feels a lot like what I imagine it would be like to live in the world of aGoT.  There's diplomacy, betrayal, armies, armadas, strategy, tactics, bidding, bluffing, and a bit of luck (although luck can be entirely removed from the game if the "Tides Of Battle" variant isn't used).  At the beginning, the game is quite simple and the turns move rather quickly.  However, as each house musters more armies and expands into new territories, the turns take longer and become more tense and mentally taxing. Very happy with this game.

I should also point out that losses and betrayals in this game feel more pointed and personal than other competitive games I've played.  I can't exactly put words to it, but the group should make a pledge to remain friends once the game ends beforehand, just to be safe.

The second edition just tweaks the game in a few select places. Overall, that's probably a slight improvement, mostly because you get parts of the expansions thrown in right away. The basic gameplay, however, hasn't changed a whole lot, to the extent that I believe a separate game entry is unnecessary.

Comments for the first edition still apply. If you liked the game before you'll also like the second edition (as I said, maybe a tad more), if you didn't, you won't like this much better, either.

If you are willing to try this game, let me warn you: whenever I play it with less than 6 players, it feels unbalanced for the Baratheons and Tyrells. That being said, with 6 players it is flawless (worth a 10)! I enjoy every bit of it every time I play. It relies very little on luck, which is great for those who like strategy. Besides, it has most of the elements of A Song of Ice and Fire. If you're a fan of the books or the TV series, this is your game!

The trouble with this game is separating things as being personal and in-game betrayal.  Whenever you went back on a deal, that would often carry over into personal matters for my game group and future alliances would almost always be impossible.  Could just be a dynamic of our group.

RATING: 8
Solid game that has a lot to offer in terms of in-depth strategy. Using your units to gain a tactical advantage on the board is fun and interesting, good bidding mechanics and the hand-management gets better the more you play. The luck factor is just big enough to make every game different and forcing you to adapt to the latest developments. Beautiful artwork and the thematic feel is amazing.

This game has a couple downsides though. You need a lot of table space, explaining all the rules takes at least half an hour (with people that are experienced in board games) and games can take hours if you play with people that want to analyze all the options, which is very frustrating if it is clear you are no longer in a winning position. Biggest downside imho is that this game will promote passive play and will rarely see good alliances, especially when played with rational calculating players. All players will converge to the same strategy, play passive for 9 turns and then go for one big final push.

Nice game with a great action-selection mechanism. Trying to find out what orders the other players will give to their units and trying to trick them is huge fun. It is somewhat unbalanced, but I don't mind that. As it is very interactive and tough, I find the small victories with weaker houses also rewarding. (I do not really care about the intended spirit of the game.) Nevertheless it is also relatively fiddly, and has quite a few additional stuff which do not add much to the entertainment (for me), but they eat up a lot of time. I got frustrated by this after some plays.

Wargame with no dice. Yes please.

Feel kind of stuck in a corner instead of spreading across the map, due I guess to the relatively "short" length for a wargame.

Offset by the influence tracks, which give a little more interaction across the whole player group.

Not really a fan of the making/breaking alliance gameplay, but can be played without.

If you are a fan of "A Song of Ice and Fire" this is a must have! But not only "Game of Thrones" fans may appreciate it: the game is well built, with nice components and a huge gameboard with a detailed map of Westeros. The basic game mechanics are similar to Diplomacy, but this game is way more complicated. It is deep and highly strategical! You are warned: it may take a long time (but definetly well spent time).

First game of GoT. Have been itching to try it. Overall, it is quite a solid strategy wargame. Good flavour from the source material. Good, logical flow. Simple turn structures. Easy but decision-heavy combat. A few niggly rules can bog things down at times, but rule look-ups were minimal. Waiting for the next turn can be sort of patience testing. Personally didn't like the game board art, but the card art worked very well. Sadly, this game should only be played with 6 players, so I could never justify purchasing it myself, but it's nice to know there are people out there who will play. While I give GoT an '8' for being a very solid game, it goes down a notch for being a little too grueling. The game is one of those "do the best you can with very little" and while that makes for a great thinking game, it rarely makes for a fun game. Every decision made is a decision for the best of the worst. Can be rewarding when it works, but when it doesn't it can be greatly discouraging.

A very interesting multiplayer wargame.  The mechanics remind me of Dune and Diplomacy mixed. Everything works wonderfully and fits the theme perfectly.  The different armies are encouraged by the board to play a certain way, rather than the rules, which closely resemble what those armies would do in the book.  The hidden leaders during combat and the limited, secret order tokens add a  mind game element that I really enjoyed.  My only complaint is towards the middle of the game things slow down and a sort of trench warfare begins, which is thematically right, but I worry that it could become stale after a while.  With more plays I could see me rating this higher or lower.

This game is beautiful and smart. The game components and art work are outstanding. The theme is strong. The game is rich. I like the fact it is deterministic, even though I miss throwing a big pile of dice, just like in Dead of Winter for instance.
It would have been great to be able to play the entire Westeros with only 4 players though. Also, the game relies heavily on war to win, and it would have been great to have other means leading to victory, like trade, better diplomacy mechanics - which would also have been quite thematic: it sometimes feels like a downgraded version of the epic Twilight Imperium.
The use of leaders when it comes to battles could have been more elegant. Also, for a 4-player game, I would have liked to be able to choose any 4 families amongst the pool of 6 on offer. Finally, the semi-cooperative aspect of the game with the wildlings threat is a good idea but could have been thought a bit more. The game never feels semi-cooperative the way Dead of Winter does for instance.
I think the games needs the expansion 'the feast for crows' to play with four players. It makes the game shorter, more varied and more punchy with the objectives that grant victory points. Same with the expansion 'dance with dragons' for 6 players.
I do enjoy playing this game because it is in the GOT universe, but it is just too back-stabbing for my group, which means we don't get to play it that often.

A warish game that my friends will actually play. It's funny, and frustrating, that they'll happily play thematic games like AGoT but balk at a historic game like Sword of Rome. They're both vicious, multiplayer strategic "wargames" but it's the game with more backstabbing, much higher chance of player elimination and less dice that they like (these being true ameritrash gamers who love their buckets of dice ala Arkham Horror).... All in all, A true testament to the power of a familiar theme and to another wise Licensing decision by FFG.

One of the best area control-themed games. Newer version of Diplomacy, with more nuts & bolts. Knowing the books/show helps to enjoy the game, but is not entirely necessary. The second edition has a muted, but very nice mapboard, and the pieces are quite nice. It's rewarding to play one of the Houses and make deals with other houses/players, fight battles, gain resources (like most games of this type)- but keep a watchful eyee on the wildling deck. The game can run a bit long, but is very gratifying. One of the best for this type of game.

RATING: N/A
  You are a House in Westeros, vying for power and control of the land.  You lead your armies into battle, supporting your friends and out maneuvering your enemies.  There are ten round to capture ten castles to prove your dominance.  
  This game is a where everyone must know how to play before the game begins.  It is a very deep game, though not much of a war game.  It looks like a war game, but actual battles of armies are not priority in this game.  Proof of this is that it is extremely hard to kill off troops battles, they retreat instead.  Instead this game focuses on alliances and political maneuvering to reign supreme.  There are three different powers in the game, and players bid on them in order to get special abilities.  
  This is a ton of "fun."  It is not fun while playing but after you relive it again and again.  In this way it is like RISK.  Unlike RISK, luck is almost completely negated, in and out of combat.  This means that you win or loose on your merits.  Balance is an issue however, which is a bit of a shame.
  This game is arduous to teach to new players.  It's secrecy element means they cannot learn while playing, and any weakness is immediately abused by the closest neighbors.  The game is also a lot of things to remember while playing.  As mentioned, some Houses are significantly more powerful then others in the beginning.  However they each have their own feel, which allows the players to over look this.
  A particular point of imbalance which needs to be noted is the first turn movements of Greyjoys and Lanisters.  The Greyjoys can effectively bar the Lanisters from much movement, effectively putting them back a few turns early on.
  The battle mechanics are well done, though as mentioned not exactly the focus of the game.  The game feels very much in theme to the books, and tensions rise very high in this game.  It is also very strategy based, though maybe too heavy for it's own good.

[i]"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground."[/i] --Cersei Lannister describing how this game feels to play.

[b][i]Game of Thrones[/i][/b] is not a relaxing game. You will agonize over order placement while hoping you outthought your bitter rival only to be stabbed in the back by your staunchest supporter. There's little hidden information, so the game feels very cerebral. For example, suppose I'm ahead in a battle: I'm guaranteed a victory if I play (and thereby "spend") my good card. But my opponent knows this and will likely not play his good card meaning I could still win if I play a bad card. But what if he suspects I might try to save my good card and then uses his good card on the off-chance that I play loosely thereby stealing a win... you get the idea.

[b]First Edition vs Second Edition[/b]
The 2nd edition incorporated the best parts of the expansions from the 1st edition and is, to my eyes, clearly superior.

Seems slightly better than the first edition. Still a bit too static for my taste but enjoyable.

Not sure how much replay-ability it will have for me considering I enjoy those games more.

Will probably get higher, but I want to give it room to grow, plus a slight deduction for the inherent strength of Baratheon.  Really hope they make some expansions and few new maps for 5 or fewer players.  First game I bought for my bgg, and loved the fact that after our first game we all stood over the board for about 30 minutes pointing out different tactics and paths to try next game or discussing where we went wrong.  If you're a fan of the books the game perfectly echoes the themes and vibes from the books, especially if you have a snake playing Lannister.
Recently played an epic game where in the 10th round we drew a clash of kings, one player had been saving power tokens for most of the game, he then crushed us on the iron throne voting, played for a tie and then chose himself.  His strategy worked well when Lannister broke his alliance with me by stabbing me in the back and taking one of my castles on our border (I was baratheon) in the last turn, which forced the tie that allowed it to end with Tyrell winning, Lannister getting chosen to finish second, and me finishing third.  It was perfect! (other than me losing)

finally played with 6 people. I looks like the more you play with the better. For the record, do not ignore the importance of the iron throne, the sword, or the raven. There impact is pretty significant. Greyjoy rules the seas!!! ROWR!!! There are alot of fan made variants for the game. If not playing with 6 people, I'd say do not play with less than 4 people. Play the fan made variants for starting maps and team selections. If you dont, it's noticed real fast that the game is broken because the rules do not adjust well to less players

Just played a 6 player game. it was the best! Never play with a house as neutral tokens. Find a variant or buy an expansion that allows you to play without them. 

one weird problem i have with this game is pieces some how or another disappear. Literally in the middle of a game one card just disappeared. No clue what happened to it this day. Might have to buy another copy to replace :(

Long player game with much player interaction and negotiation aspect in it. Actually could be excellent game, if there was not so much imbalanced faction powers and cards with random events. Bellow maximum number of players, which is 6 players, the game isn't that good anymore, because in better position is player, which has more free regions to attack. Also there are some gameplay drawbacks like king making, player elimination and also bidding and secret order placing can lead to very inefficiently spent resources. Therefore negotiation aspect between is very important, however rules does not give any penalty, if you don't follow your promises. However, still Game of Thrones 2nd edition is quite a good game to play at rare occasions as a long intrigue game.

The mechanics are a little simple now, but I have gotten this out with 6 players every time so the negotiation and amount of plays is great.

Recently played a few four player games that we adjusted - we blocked off the lower portion of the map from access and just played the four northern powers - so tight and fun!

After 10 plays: This game is great - it has reached classic status among all my friends. It's the go to game for playing with anyone we want interested in "advanced boardgames" it offers a deep experience (there is a lot to learn) but once learnt there is a lot of room to have a rich experience. I have now played this game with over 15 different people and they all enjoy it... now to get them to HIS and COIN :)

Risk on steroids. A great game that after a four hour first play through might be a bit unbalanced. It seems a bit tough to win as Stark given how far in the north they start and the few castles surrounding their homeland and the Greyjoy cards seem especially powerful, but the combat system is awesome and the ability to backstab and connive is fantastic. This game would be closer to 9 if it didn't take so long to play.

Un excelente juego, de mucha estrategia, además tiene mucha relación con la serie, ya que uno puede hacer actos de traición, lo que lo hace muy entretenido.

Played twice (one of those plays was with the first addition). Once with 5, once with 6. The 6 player game didn't end because we ran out of time but it was probably set to run to about 4 hours. There was a lot of chat afterwards which is encoraging, shows the game had an impact. This kind of "fighting" game is not really my thing but once in a while it's fun to play something other than a euro. If I'm to play a combat game and we have 4 hours then I'm as willing to play this as Runewars, Cyclades or Rex.

My most favorite game of all time. It has deep strategic decision but not so hard to make. It's very interesting how you always start with the same starting position (for every house), but the game can play very differently according to the people on the table. For a game with no random starting location and/or map, the game has tremendous replay value according to everyone's move on round 1. The game is different every time according to the type of players on the board. Ambitious Stark makes Greyjoy defensive. Peaceful Greyjoy makes Lannister ambitious and so on. The game also has tactical decision with battle cards and temporary alliances. Play it with the right type of players and you'll love the game too!

RATING: 9
I highly recommend this game. It's highly thematic but also works great even if you are not familiar with game of thrones. I love the mechanics this game has and especially the almost completely absence of luck. It needs a lot of negotiation and interaction between the players, thing I really appreciate in games. It's highly strategic,not only in the battlefield, where you have many possible orders for your units, but also out of it, when having to deal with 'politics' or having to 'feed' your army. The game rolls much faster after 2-3 plays, so it's not tiring at all, but really emotional and interesting. The theme as I said is awesome, making you a real Lannister or Stark etc. from the very first round.

I have played the game over 15 times so far and every game was unique. We have so much fun with my friends, when betraying or threatening each other, or when recalling lines from the books. Secretly talking to each other in order to attack or defence from someone break 'alliances' is really glorifying the game.

The only disadvantage in this game I can find (which is not actually a big one) is that it works perfect only with 6 players. I have tried playing with 3,4,5 players, but it doesn't work good at all. Neutral forces being placed with less than 6 players are easily defeated most times, making the player next to them really overpowered and allowing him to expand really fast.

Overall it's a 'must' game for game of thrones fans, who like strategy in and out the battlefield. If you have a 6 player group that likes games like this, pick it up and have fun!

RATING: 2
Worst game I've played. It comes down to a combination of things:

- game length: first game took all afternoon plus a majority of the evening. Other times it took around 5-6 hours to finish. 

- complexity: this is not an easy game to teach or understand.

- experienced players have a big edge: the game is 'figured out' to the point that there are opening moves for different houses. If you don't open with one of these moves your essentially playing the game sub-optimal.

- (pseudo) player elimination: you can get wiped out, or more commonly, get beat to the point of no return. First game I played someone started playing Starcraft 2 because he had almost nothing left after a couple of turns. I quite the last game that I played after 3/4 rounds because there was no coming back.

- the diplomacy aspect: I'm not a fan of this in general, but in GoT it was the worst because of the Lannister and Greyjoy starting positions. You had to strike a truce from turn 1, or else you couldn't win. 

All of these things combined made for a terrible gaming experience. I don't mind most of these aspects individually. But when put together it made for a long and stressful experience that gave me no enjoyment. A Game of Thrones isn't an objectively bad board game. It's just a game that I never want to play again and almost turned me off boardgaming all together.

Great adaptation of the source material. The action system is fantastic, where you place a face down order per province you control. Once all provinces have one, then you flip them over and resolve. This can create really interesting situations where you agree to do something but end up doing the opposite - just like in the books.

It's like they took the best of Risk and Diplomacy, added some very cool new mechanics, wrapped them up in a solid theme, and gave us this game.  You will be stabbed in the back.  You will stab someone in the back.  You will find great victories.  You will suffer bitter defeats.  Great game!

As a first foray into multiplayer negotiated wargaming, it is a good game because it (a) is true to the books; (b) is not so complicated; and (c) promotes some negotiation.

But it is not the most interesting of its genre. Dune is far better, possibly because AGOT suffers from a too much determinism. At the very least, there are optimal pathways for initial plays (gambits) and overall strategies.

It's possible that it will enjoy a cult-like following for years that could engender institutional strategy that will give it a legacy. Or it could go the way of the do-do.

Somehow I suspect that Fief: France 1429 will be a better game.

6-player rating only.  I haven't tried all of the other combinations, but 6 player was certainly a blast and felt somewhat balanced.  I played 1st edition several years ago and wasn't impressed.  Not sure if my new rating is based on the fact that I have now read the books, or the 2nd edition is just that much better.

includes A Dance with Dragons and A Feast for Crows expansions.

Game 1:
House Tyrell; back-stabbed by the Martells and Baratheon (lost Highgarden), but used Loras to first take a Martell stronghold, a Queen of Thorns removal of a march order to mess up Martell, and finally a last-turn push into King's Landing through The Reach to come in 2nd place behind Greyjoy, with Martell in 5th and Baratheon in 6th.  Revenge!

Although there are some not too common mechanics, it felt like a pretty standard conquest game to me, typical FFG's bloated design with nothing particularly good, interesting or even worth a second play.

Players stay around their home regions for most of the game, trying to get and keep castles. The game moves slowly, because, for the most part, you depend on a random event in order to recruit new troops. Combat is based on cards, not dice, but since the cards are open information, it takes longer than it should, as players check all the values, special powers and possible interactions. My only game too often came to a halt when combat happened. Maybe I was just bored with the rest of the game already, but the downtime during other players’ battles was excruciatingly painful. At least I wasn’t Lannister, because the game seems heavily unbalanced against it, and that player was clearly out of contention very early. The game lasted some five hours, and after such an overly long time, it was frustrating to see it end in a bash-the-leader fest, with potential for kingmaking, until someone sneaked in a victory.

On the production, I don’t understand why FFG did not upgrade the units to miniatures in this second edition. At first, the pieces look sufficiently distinguishable, but may be a little confusing and hard to tell at a glance on the board.

Great game! The strategy is really satisfying, and very immersive. You actually fell like being in westeros and being as a house of the books (or series). It is a very hard game to explain to new players, but once you play it, it is hard to not like. I myself have seen many non-gamers liking this a lot. I'm not giving a 10 just because of the unbalance when played with less than 6 players. Territories in the south really decide who wins in these cases, which sucks, but you can actually have a lot of fun, even though. Anyways, for players who like strategy, this is a should-have.

I used to like A Game of Thrones a lot. But after a few bad plays, I'm lowering my rating quite a bit. The Westeros decks are so arbitrary. When the cards come out in the right order, the game is very satisfying, even if I am on the losing end of the order. But when the cards come out in any other way, the game seems to come down to who benefits from the arbitrary order of Westeros cards.

Furthermore, the game is really decided after 6 rounds. No one can realistically win via the auto-win condition. So why have the game last an extra four game rounds? If you like the game that much, play two sessions of it to 6 rounds instead of one game of it to ten.

Brilliant game, such a rewarding experience.

However if you have less than the maximum number of players, actually make the southern locations a no go zone.

I saw once a 5 player game where 1 player just moved through that area and won in the second round. Think they must have gotten other rules wrong too, but one person in that group now hates the game because of that session.

Give it a try.

Thème intéressant. Les figurines sont difficilement différenciables. Le jeu reste un jeu d'élimination où des joueurs affaiblis peuvent difficilement remonter la pente et même se faire éliminer. Les joueurs qui ont une force d'armée moins forte peuvent attendre un temps assez long pour que les joueurs les plus forts finissent leur tour. Cela enlève l'intérêt du jeu pour tous les joueurs et le jeu peut parraître alors assez long. Le jeu à quelques défauts au niveau de l'esthétisme. On est loin de l'esthétisme d'un Cyclade.

RATING: 8
An excellent (if a little long) game.  Played with exactly 6.  The simultaneous action system, the "nobody dies" nature of the combat, the political systems, and a cleverly designed map all work together to create a very fun game that emulates the overall political / war situation of the books very closely.  Highly recommended, especially if you are a fan of games like Dune, diplomacy, Friedrich, even something like imperial.

RATING: 9
I love this game since I love Diplomacy. This game is Diplomacy-light, and the theme pulls in my friends that love the show. When I say "Diplomacy-light", I don't mean that this is a short game. It is a long slog of battle, negotiation, and back-stabbing, which is fun on its own, but do NOT start this game after 9pm, you will never finish.

RATING: 7
Great game which builds on Diplomacy.

Very strong theme, great experience but at times the battles are unpridictable to the extreme. Planning and odds calculation are irrelevant at times. Trying to read the intentions of your enemies is the name of the game. No dice bit the cards and orders create as much chaos as dice.

Fantastic multiplayer experience, the more the marrier i.m.o. as the diplomatic element takes full effect.

Great components, great game but misses empirebuilding like Twilight Imperium.

RATING: 3
I like the social aspect of the game, forming alliances, backstabbing at the right time - but one six player game took us about seven hours to complete, and that is simply too much for what it offers.

In retrospect, it seemed like during those hours nothing much had really happened on the board (4 of those 7 hours were probably spent negotiating rather than actually playing). Most players were still holding on to their predfined starting areas at the end. I only had the possibility to interact with 2 of the other players during the whole game.

This epic game of war and intrigue gets your right into the thick of it by turn 2. No holds barred above and beyond the ones you painfully negotiate with your neighbouring houses (at great cost). This game moves at a reasonable pace by keeping each and every action turn-based or simultaneous so you never wait too long. The secret order laying is especially clever. Furthermore, this game captures much of the flavour of the much loved book or television series in terms of setting up the asymmetrical tensions, abilities, and mechanisms for supporting and betraying each other.

This is certainly an easy step up from RISK while still feeling very meaningful.

Played once with 6 players as Lannister.  It was fairly tense and unpleasant during gameplay, but after experiencing the entire game, I like a lot of the design decisions that were made.  It took about 5 hours, but I can see where you could shrink it down to 2.5-3 if most players are experienced.  Main concern long term is sameness in game sessions because of only a single map and no modular elements.  Very thematic!

Great game. Needs 6 players for the full potential. You have to play thinking the whole time about potential actions by the others as you can never completely predict what your enemies will do.

Solid, but i can't play these kind of games anymore.. 
basically it doesn't really matters what you do in your first turns.. or rather the best strategy is to turtle wait & bide your time.. until somehow you pull of victory because everyone is bashing the heck out of the lead player..
Not my kind of fun.
GoT often facilitates this "why are you attacking me..? You should attack him instead" behavior.. wich is VERY annoying.

I have one major problem with this game, and it may not even be a problem with the game itself: there is not enough negotiation. In AGOT game there should be alliancing, negotiating, and backstabbing - all of which I have heard this game has, but something about it (or my group) doesnt facilitate this. 

I need to try it again with the note passing variant to determine what I feel about it.

Game of Thrones: The Board Game's mechanics do an excellent job of encouraging players to battle and interact. The simultaneous turns allow for action under uncertainty without anything really random, like dice, and the complexity of the tracks for advancement really keep you thinking about how to distribute your resources. 

The game does have a steep learning curve, and although I don't have a problem with any specific game mechanism, the sheer number of things to keep track of can lead to quite long turns.

RATING: 9
(01/2012) Played a friend's new second edition copy. I already own the first edition with both expansions, so I will comment on the differences.

The game or gameplay have not changed significantly, although there are a few minor touches and tweaks that are noteworthy:
1) Board is striking in appearance, with gorgeous artwork, starker colors, and more medieval look. However, the board is much thinner than the 1st edition (think AH Civilization quality, versus the board quality of the latest crop of games like Brass), and it has a very noticeable (and not immediately correctable) warp; is FFG trying to cut corners here? On the other hand, the counters look like they popped out of the counter sheets cleanly with very little flare/fuzz, compared to the 1st edition. Cards have nice linen finish, typical of latest FFG, instead of matt finish from 1st edition. Units are now made of equally gorgeous colored marbled plastic. Players now have player aid screens. Board now has a victory point track, whereas before you just had to count and remember where everyone was at.
2) More dynamic events in the Westeros cards (from Storm of Swords expansion), some giving the Iron Throne, Valyrian Sword, and the Messenger Raven owners something to choose from a menu of three possible events.
3) More neutral tokens (instead of the original three) to help adjust (and provide obstacles) for less than six players. Game comes ready to play with six (from Clash of Kings expansion), with House Martel included.
4) Ports, siege engines, and garrisons are now part of the main game (from Clash of Kings expansion), and they integrate seamlessly.
5) There is a new Wildlings event deck (from Storm of Swords), which gives a unpredictable twist to what happens if the Night Watch wins or loses. Now, the Raven owner can peek at an upcoming card. Before, the rewards/consequences were deterministic.
6) Two of the special Orders have expanded capabilities--Consolidate power will now allow collecting a power token OR mustering if at city/stronghold; Raid can now cancel a defense order (before, would cancel two raid/support/consolidate orders). These capabilities were specific to Special One-Time Order tokens from two different Houses in Storm of Swords.
7) The House cards have more interesting, dangerous capabilities than from the 1st edition (from Storm of Swords expansion). For example, the #3 House Tyrell card allows the attacker, if he/she wins the battle, to keep the attack order token with the attacking force! (This allowed me to sweep through two areas to reach an unsupported 7th city for the win.)

All in all, this is a very impressive 2nd edition, taking the best elements from the Clash of Kings and Storm of Swords expansions. The rules are much clearer and concise than the 1st edition, with a lot of loop holes and potential questions cleared up with examples. The production quality is significantly better, such that it makes me want to get the 2nd edition, if it weren't for the huge miss with the board quality/thickness. Still, a good solid game that has finally "settled". Initial rating an '8'.

Update (02/26/12) I am almost tempted to get the 2nd edition, just for the artwork. I am finally sold on the marbled plastic pieces too. I am convinced that it has hit upon the perfect blend of variant rules from the two expansions; it doesn't need anything else to improve it. It is on its way to becoming "great", but needs more plays. Upping rating to a '9'. However, my friend's board continues to warp even more. :shake:

Only took half of one game to realize we were playing it all wrong (not to mention, we didn't involve the other Houses for missing players, making the game far from balanced) so there is a small learning curve. Once we overcame this, we enjoyed every minute of it. Not being familiar with the source material, I gave the game away to a friend after I obtained it for free from a hand-me-down.

This is the perfect scope and scale for a Game of Thrones boardgame. The books are about treason, intrigue and power; and so is this game. If you want a Game of Thrones boardgame, go for this game.

Initially when you read the rules, its seems very complicated. After a few turns, its quite easy. Then, you realize that it actually is a light but strategic game. 
May even bump it up to 10 once I get a few more games down.

Amazing game if you play it with 5 or 6 players. With 4 it isn't that good and I won't ever play a 3 player game. Bear in mind that betrayals and backstabbing are going to happen A LOT. That captures the atmosphere of the universe very well but might grant you some animosity.

RATING: 9.9
It truly is awesome and would recommend it to anybody, being a GoT fan is absolutely not necessary!!

This is a pure strategy area control game. The main reason I love it is the tactics you can use, there are no dice involved, just your own strategy against your opponents! Create alliances, break them, advance and grow your army to control the board, or sit back and try gain as much power as possible and buy you're way to being a super power!

Only slight negative is that if playing with 4 players the game is a bit unbalanced, but very simple house rules can fix this. 

Other than that, I have no complaints about the game! Go buy it! It's seriously freaking awesome!

RATING: 8
Excellent game, similar in may ways to Diplomacy. Component quality is excellent, and the theme of the books plays well through the mechanics. This game necessitates ALL players understanding well the implications of having a certain player be too strong or too weak. My only complaint - though not insignificant - is the immense loss that can come from losing the blind bids (3 in succession).

This game is too long.  I am done with dudes on a map games with negotiated teams and backstabbing.  I dislike the deterministic combat and card play.  I don't like the three tracks that are bid on.  I don't like the way new armies are added to the map. I hate everything about this whole game.  I love the HBO series, but I don't feel the game of thrones experience when I played this game.  It's a shitty game with a pasted on theme.

This game is awesome but only if you play with 4-5 players.  It has rules and feel similar to Diplomacy, but also has a more dynamic points due to the bidding for influence and events. It is also a little more forgiving and powerhouses have small reasonable limitations which makes everyone feel like they have a chance for quite a while. The problem with the smaller games is that the player that is first to the south always wins. If you are in the north, forgetta bout it.

RATING: 8
Played this lots now - love it; with the right mix of people this game is my idea of fun.

2016: What I find frustrating about this game is that once everyone is familiar with it, it's very difficult for anyone to get a surprise 7 castle win; which means the game nearly always goes the full 10 turns now, and it's usually settled on a tiebreaker for most strongholds, or a kingmaker deciding which winner to take a castle from in the last turn.

This is my kind of game. It shines at 4(w/expansion) or 6 (with or without expansion). It has intrigue, strategy, diplomacy, interesting card play, theme, and more. I absolutely ADORE this game. I'm also slightly bias due to my obsession with the IP.

RATING: 5
Must have exactly 6 players for the game to work right.  It's somewhere between an area control game, and a war game.  The game takes a too long for what it is.  It marginally captures the overarching theme of the books, but specific characters only really show up during the battles when cards are used, so you may never see your favorite character.  Feels a bit like diplomacy.  The only thing I feel like I've accomplished after this game is over is wasting a huge chunk of my time.

OWNED SINCE 2011
    This is a great game. It is fast, easy to learn, and the mechanics of the game usually keeps the game close until the end; no one every wins by a land slide, and no one can monopolize the board. Would recommend to any one, even non- hard core gamers. 
    My kids, ages 7 years and older, can play this one just fine. Even my younger one, who does not take everything too serious can have fun. If nothing else he likes to attack and "bother" people. When he does this the game is still fun, and because his behavior is unpredictable it is a great strategy in and of itself. The parents and children enjoy this game, but definitely best with 6 players unless you are playing with one of the 4 player expansion scenarios. Overall, a good game that becomes great when everyone playing competitively to win.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Takes a while to get into the swing of it and can run for an age, but it is a superb multi-layered strategy game. The various actions and process are great, but when the player treaties and wildling attacks come into play you are dealing with a whole different beats. Three player games don't play as well for me as 4+.

A good game - with the right group.

RATING: 2
Played this for the first time the other night, and it will hopefully be my last. 

This game hits on practically every hallmark of an unpleasant game experience. Let's keep a tally shall we?

- Incredibly steep learning curve and overly complex rule system making it overwhelmingly unfriendly to beginners and difficult for veterans to explain adequately? Check
- Over an hour just to take the first game turn (mostly due to rules explanation)? Check
- The need to know and understand every facet of the game's minutiae from the very first turn in order to properly execute any sort of competent strategy? Check
- Cumbersome combat and unit instruction mechanic? Check
- Imbalanced (VERY imbalanced) factions? Check
- Not well designed to be played with anything less than the maximum amount of players? Check
- Game length should be expected to exceed 5 hours? Check
- Horrible down time between turns? Check
- A faux-"perfect information" game which actually has an alarming amount of hidden information and luck (via card abilities, game events, action limitations, etc.)? Check
- Certain players never interacting with one another in a 4+ hour game due to mechanics and layout? Check
- The most clear and viable strategy (really the ONLY strategy it seems) being to lay low and avoid conflict and interaction, hoping for other players to beat each other up? Check
- "Take that" style of gameplay being the overwhelming draw? Check
- Due to previous point, the overwhelming feeling everyone experiences is animosity on a night that is supposed to be fun? Check
- Irrelevant theme in a game where bad game mechanics exist in order to facilitate the supposed theme? Check
- Uninteresting decisions? Check
- Forced actions (often with no meaning)? Check
- Little to no tactical opportunities? Check
- Potential for players to be effectively eliminated in the first turn or so? Check
- Heavy dose of kingmaking due to the previous point? Check
- Runaway leader problems which can only be resolved by people ganging up on the leader? Check
- Does not allow nor encourage creative paths to victory? Check
- No incentive for conflict other than a lack of anything better to do? Check
- Impressively shallow gameplay considering time commitment required? Check
- Nothing inherently fun in the primary game mechanic (selecting action tokens)? Check

This game was an absolute chore in all the negative ways the word "chore" implies. It wasn't fun, it was long, it was arduous, and in the end it felt like all the back and forth and give and take mattered for naught. Essentially we could have accomplished the same experience had we just sat around the table and argued over who we wanted to win: 

Person 1: "I think Person 5 should win" 
Person 2: "but I'm about to win..." 
Person 1: "yeah, but she almost quit earlier, and if she won now that would be cool" 
Person 3: "yeah, and I'm not going to win anyway, and I don't want you to win, so I'll just say let's let Person 5 win"
Person 4: "Yeah, Person 5 wins"
Person 2: "Darn..."
Person 5: "W00t"

Playing this game feels like playing Tic-Tac-Toe for hours, but instead of draws, you argue over who wins the draw and get a friend to settle the argument one way or the other. Over, and over, and over.

Another game where the best way to win is to gather your forces and wait for others to show weakness make and horrible mistakes.


Edit 2017:

I do like the marbled plastic player pieces and the production values of the rest is not far behind. I guess that I mainly object to the incredibly claustrophobic feel of the map as well as the feeling that the winning strategy seems to be waiting for moments of weakness on other players parts rather you managing to build anything yourself. 

I seem to prefer Forbidden Stars as that atleast gives you little something to build and upgrade. This just feels too tight and merciless for a game of this length. Also knowing all the combat decks by heart offers a rather impressive advantage. Another minus on my part is that a win is predicated on holding the castles and as such to win you have to advance and hold ground. This does not leave room for other sneaky play than sit and build and explode when others are weak. 

Perhaps I've just played with meh company but that is pretty much the only way I see this working in the mid and late game. Early game can be interesting in the expansion and beginning conflict shuffle. Not too enjoyable for me though because of the vacillary nature of map states. You just never feel like you've achieved much until you get to a pouncing distance. Also playing really well pretty much guarantees that you have to grind someones face with your boot to have the room needed unless the others have played poorly.

I love this game. It has some great mechanics that work very well: the action planning phase is very good, the idea of assigning actions in secret to every army on the board and the option of removing orders played by the other players, the 3 trackers that change by betting with influence tokens, I think that it is a very good idea that does tokens are used as well for controlling territories without an army. I think that everything works amazingly fine. Even the game shouldn't be too long. The longest phase is planning at the beginning of each turn, after that, the resolution should be fast (it should, there are always slow players). The combat mechanics is really interesting but introduces one thing that may be an issue, which is that every player should know every army's deck.
Positive:
1. The mechanics. Work very well
2. The back and forth structure of the game. If every player works reasonably well, it is very difficult for every player to obtain a total victory before the end of the last turn
3. The crown, raven... trackers
4. The unique card decks of every house
Negative:
1. This game has to be played by 6 players. Period. The recommended houses configurations for 3, 4 or 5 players do not work. Even alternative setups are not very good. For 6 is perfect
2. Every player needs to play well. If Highgarden doesn't protect the south area from Sun Spear, that player will win. Without any doubt. It is mandatory, every border on the map has to be at stake during the whole game
3. The sea is extremely powerful. Controlling the sea means everything. Particularly for some houses like Baratheon and Greyjoy

He jugado una partida a 3 jugadores y las impresiones son muy buenas. No da tiempo a aburrirte entre turnos porque todos planeamos a la vez. Hemos notado cierta ventaja para los Starks, la próxima si somos tres aplicaremos una modificación a las reglas que leí en su día. Muy estratega y mucho que planificar. Me ha gustado mucho, hay ganas de jugar de nuevo.

RATING: 5.5
Sort of a weird game, I was the Baratheons and it seemed like I was very heavily incentivized to attack the Lannisters, but that went poorly because the battle outcome is determined semi-randomly. So I was down to like 3 troops on the board very quickly, and by chance no "get more guys" end of round cards came up for a while. But then I don't know what happened really because the Lannisters and Arryns sort of just had minor squabbles with each other and the Starks were left pretty much alone in the north for a while, and so they just destroyed the rest of us. I saw it happening but I didn't want to say anything because I figured I had no shot and I certainly didn't want the Lannisters to win at that point. But in spite of my particular experience sounding pretty unpleasant, I could see an interesting game in there. For one picking your action discs simultaneously is pretty interesting, though the fact that you could just never have any stars all game is pretty brutal (probably not insurmountable, just unfun). Also the special effects of the cards you play to supplement your troops are a cool nod to the characters themselves and add some interesting strategic decisions. The best part though is probably that the deck of cards that randomly adjust the battle outcomes are apparently only for beginners (in particular they're optional) so we can just never use those again. Overall I liked it about as much as I think I could like an Ameritrashy DoaM game, which is just enough that I'd be ok playing this if someone else really wanted to.

This is very mucb an Amerigame in which you control Houses from Game of Thrones and seek to dominate Westeros.  For fans of the series, it does a good job of evoking the original material.  You have to maneuver to capture provinces that in turn provide you with various kinds of resources.  A key aspect is that you put a face-down marker on each province that indicates what you will be doing and they are then flipped simultaneously.  This allows for plenty of negotiations and potential back stabs followed by a dramatic reveal.  There is also periodic bidding over positioning on one of three powerful tracks that determine how moves first, who wins ties, and so forth.  Winning requires making alliances and then turning on your ally at the right time.  I'm not a big fan of Diplomacy type games so I'm not giving it a high rating but it's a very good implementation.  I can be talked into playing it usually despite my aversion to this type of game play.

It's a pretty good design. It shares many problems with other multiplayer conflict games but it also has a few unique, very enjoyable mechanics.

As for the theme, it's more present in the gameplay and the emotions it provokes in players than what actually goes down on the board. I'm still looking for a Song of Ice and Fire game that includes elements like assassination, manipulation and politics.

I'm ready to play more, even if I know that not all games will be enjoyable. Such is the nature of these games!

RATING: 6.5
This game has great theme, elegant mechanics, fine production and some nice card interaction/planning.

What stops me liking this game a bit more is the hidden orders phase, and the lack of dynamics on the board - a player starts in 2-3 territories and wins if they can advance slowly to occupy another half a dozen or so, without getting into serious conflict with someone-else.

One of the best strategy games. It works for me. Bought a copy not too long back, because I saw a video on the game play of the game (been living in a hole as I did not realise that it was take on the medieval styled fantasy novels and paid TV series). Played it and have now gotten the 2 expansions.
I love this game, the problem is getting others to play long games (2+hr) that are strategic. Alliances, breaking of alliances and lying to each other are all built into the game play. Play it with resilient friends.
However, if you don't like or a game with lots of parts, give the game a miss.

Inital Rating: 7.0 (April 2012)

What a disappointment. I thought the game was going to be great as I love negotiation games and the fantasy setting of A Game of Thrones. Perhaps my bad experience was due to my game group but now I almost always resist a game of this.  

The game explanation can take a while but the play time is the worst, it can be very high with lots of downtime (very repetitive), the game advances very slowly, I feel very restricted in my decisions and I´m obliged to fight with my neighbors no matter what. Also there seems to be a lot of unbalance between factions, apparently you can’t play this with fewer than 6 players. It’s like a worse Risk. 

When I play this I feel like I’m wasting my precious boardgaming time. I’m downgrading its rating to a level I feel matches my feelings toward the game.

On the good side the game production values are pretty nice, although  I would have preferred miniatures to show the armies on the map.

In conclusion, a bad tedious game. I will give it another chance in the far future, but if the mood strikes to play something like this, I will always prefer Dune over A Game of Thrones.

Current Rating: 3.0

After another play, I was surprised I enjoyed the game a bit more. It is definitively very group dependant but I still find the game a time waster due to the high downtime. Nowadays I really don't like games in which the players have to attack the leader to achieve balance and AGOT has lots and lots of 'take that'. 

I feel the best strategy is to lay low for nine turns and then make your big move.  

I would probably play it very sparingly as many friends love it but I don't think I will ever buy it or request it. 

Current Rating: 4.5

RATING: 7
I think the published 2nd Edition is probably better than the 1st Edition Core Game but probably worse than the combined 1st Ed + 2 Expansions. The biggest "difference" is the addition of the "kicker" cards and I don't think I like them.  The game is pretty much built on tight combat results and letting Support Orders and Fiefdoms Track ranking determine the outcome.  As you add more randomness, the outcomes are less deterministic and it becomes more of a "Dudes on a Map" Game.

I've long held to the belief that this game benefits from less rules, not more, and I usually opted to play 1st Edition without alot of the more byzantine rules but this includes them as basic rules.  Overall, it's not as simple to explain to new players and less flexible to expand than the 1st Edition.

Played 2 sessions this weekend with 4 players. Essentially this game reminded me of a more robust version of Risk set in Westeros. I did enjoy the plays.  I particularly enjoyed the asymmetry of the game. Each house starts with different strategies to put in place based on their starting location and units, and unique house cards for use in battle.  I also liked how each troop (or army) on the board received unique orders. 

The simultaneous placement of troop orders did work to move the game along . . .  but our games nevertheless, lasted 6 hours and 7 hours respectively (there were short breaks for cooking, eating, and beverages in between - also the first game involved some set up and rules time)- BEWARE THIS IS A LONG GAME.  Interestingly, our second game when we already had the rules down actually took longer than the first (understanding the moves and other players hands etc. resulted in longer analysis time!). 

The game is by nature aggressive, some houses have to be more aggressive than others based on where they are situated but combat is an essential part of the game - so for those who don't like aggressive games -- stay away from this one.  Personally, aggressive games aren't my favorite but I don't exclude them categorically and since this game is premised on battling and area control everyone knows what they are getting into.  

All-in-all this is a unique game experience and was fun - but in retrospect, if someone told me I could have 12 hours of gaming I'm not sure I would want to spend it on two games of GOT.

Good implementation of the AGOT Universe in War Game, but not without many flaws.

With 6 players, this is an intense, strategic, unforgiving and at times brutal game. Which is why it's very, very good.

It's also slooooww (in terms of downtime), looong (in terms of playtime) and can be a meat grinder with the same spaces being fought over repeatedly over several turns. Which is why it's not - quite - great.

Played the shorter 4p variant, and it's very good - you need to stay sharp as it can be over pretty quickly

I really like the game, especially the theme, but I don't think the set-up is fair to every player. There are definite advantages to certain factions depending how many are playing. If the skill of all the players is equal then it's really hard to overcome these disadvantages without alliances (but maybe that was what was intended).

I held back buying the first edition because of a bad playing experience, but after re-reading the books I decided to grab a copy of the second edition.

Some of the problems I had with the first edition are still there and the game is very prone to AP, but this edition appears to be better organised.

Although deal-making is really never mentioned in the rules, you cannot win the game on your own.  Deals must be made (and broken) if you want to win.  Herein lies my biggest complaint... diplomacy can drag out the game to an exruciating length.  The two to four hours listed on the box can easily extend to six or more.

The 2nd edition components are worth the price.  Gone are the bright colours and wooden pieces of the original.  The new map has been redrawn with darker shades and the new plastic pieces are fantastic.  Everything has a grittier 'feel'... much like the books the game is trying to represent.  My rating has increased a notch because of this.

I know that I'll probably never play this game more than one or two times, but I'm glad to have it in my collection.

Lead one of the Houses to control territory and win the Iron Throne. Players not familiar with the books or television show will be at a disadvantage because Houses are designed in a way that improves chance of success following the plot rather than going your own way.

One of my very first experiences into the world of designer board gaming and still to this day my number 1. 

I love area control and combat that will be a running theme with most of my highest scoring games, I love conquering empires and the fact its set in the game of thrones world which I also love is great.

I love the pieces as it gives that feel of a general planning and maneuvering his armies into battle although the pieces could of been a bit bigger so they were more easily distinguished.
The character cards and their effects are also great!

I feel they could of done more with the wildling deck personally as sometimes the effects arent very thematic but all in all a great game.

A veces cuando juegas a un juego basado en una saga (pelis, series de TV, libros...) te das cuenta de que lo crearon sólo por sacar provecho pero el juesgo está vacío. Ése no es el caso de JdT, en mi opinión.

Lo primero de todo: el tema encaja perféctamente con la mecánica elegida. Una lucha continua por el poder y el territorio es lo que puedes encontrar en JdT.

El núcelo del juego es la asignación secreta de órdenes a tus unidades. Esto no es ninguna revolución, si alguna vez has jugado al clásico juego de mesa "Diplomacy" ya has visto este sistema. Es inteligente, elegante y no hay tiempos muertos porque todo el mundo juega a la vez.

Resolver las órdenes es tambien rápido. En esta fase los jugadores podrían entrar en combate y jugar sus "chulísimas" cartas de personaje, dependiendo de la casa que hayan elegido.

Hay más cosas en el juego, como la fase de los Westeros, los diferentes tipos de marcadores... pero, como he dicho antes, las órdenes son lo más importante.

En un juego como JdT el acabado visual debe de ser impresionante y pienso que este juego lo tiene. Las cartas son muy bonitas, el tablero es grande y lleno de detalles... pero las piezas son simplemente excelentes. No son de madera sino de plástico pero son muy molonas.

Resumiendo, JdT es un juego muy bueno en el que puedes elegir tu casa favorita basada en la novela y pelear contra tus amigos por el control del Trono de Hierro.

Sometimes when you play a game based on a saga (films, TV shows, books...) you notice that they created it only to get profit of its name but the game itself is empty. That's not what you get with GoT IMHO.

First of all: its theme fits perfect with the mechanic chosen. A continuous struggle for power and territory is what you can find in GoT.

The main core of the game is assigning secretly orders to your units. This is not a revolution, if you ever have played to the classic boardgame "Diplomacy" you have already seen this system. It´s clever and elegant and there is no downtime because everybody is playing at the same time.

Resolving orders is also fast. In this phase players could get into combat and play their "cool" character's cards, depending on the House they chose.

There are also other things in the game, like the Westeros phase, the different kind of tracks... but, as I said before, the orders are the most important.

In a game like GoT the art must be impressive and I think this game owns it. Cards are very beautiful, board is big and plenty of details... but tokens are simply excellent. No wood but plastic but they are pretty cool.

Summarizing, GoT is a very good game where you can choose your favorite novel-based house and fight against your friends for the control of the Iron Throne.[/color]

RATING: 8
well well.   This was better with 4 than with 3 by a good margin.  I can only assume it would soar even higher with 5+ players.  

Already ordered the expansions to help with the 4 player game.  

REally enjoyed the diplomacy and cunning needed to do we ll in this game, as well as the simultaneous action selection mechanisms.

It takes a while to play, but this is a good one.

UPDATE:

With 4, this games just takes too long.  Not sure why, but with out group, it is well over 3+ hours.  Will try with the expansion next time, but the long play time significantly impacts the rating on this one.  Love the game.  needs to be shorter playtime.

Initial reaction is positive, although AP a pretty serious in the second half of the game.  You really have to control the sea spaces.  Seems to always end in scores of 4,4,4,3,3,3 (or close).  After four games the AP is pretty annoying.  I also find the board very hard to see properly, which is very trying after 3 hours.  For a game with no downtime there seems to be an awful lot of downtime.  A bad player will really make it easy for his neighbours to win.  I feel that Shogun is better in this game genre.
Update - this game is pretty awful. So much analysis paralysis it kills the game stone dead. Downtime is horrific. Stupid use of blind bidding.

Interesting, very good, but sometimes overrated. In my opinion it has some serious design flaws. It's not idiot-proof and fun depands too much on with who do you play. Also I hate the idea that someone can just lose in the middle of the game or just be devasted by other player and don't mean anything for the rest of the game (and by "rest" I mean 3 hours). I fear that it can get schemtic after a while. The 2nd edition board is more thematic and designed better graphically, but maybe less clear. It's nice they added elements from expansions to the 2nd edition base game.

With five players, not much difference to the first edition although Baratheon and Tyrell are even stronger with five here. Six players probably is the charm, haven't tried yet. All relevant elements previously added in the expansions now are already part of the base game (ports, garrisons, wildling cards). Still a good although potentially frustrating game.

One play only but it was an amazing game.  We played 5 hours but it didn't feel long until the final two turns.  One other game left me feeling this excited about a game after one play and that was Dominant Species (which I rate a 10).  We played with 5 and it worked great.  Can't wait to play with 6, especially that we know how to play now.  We did not play with the bonus/expansion cards.  I would play this over and over I think.  Rules are simple, battle is basic, gameplay flows pretty well, but the game play is COMPLEX!  Only criticism is that all players will mostly be even going into the final rounds based on the "dick the leader" philosophy.  Very similar to Cosmic Encounter.  That's a negative for me because I like when a good strategy will win a game.  It's a positive for me too because you're never out of the game.  

Update: second play with the same group and the game moves much quicker (2 1/2 hours).  Played much differently because musters were few and far between.  Everyone was within victory at the end again except for Lovejoy who seems to be at a disadvantage after two plays.

Interesting game that thrives on the license. Thinking about picking up the expansions.

Couple of flaws for me:
* You only care about your neighbours. Other players are just downtime for you, especially when they're fighting.
* People usually don't reach 7 castles. Ending a game by running out the clock... meh.
* People end up so far from eachother. Why not push us towards direct conflict from turn 1? Right now t1 is usually super safe, often even t2. Not when I play though. Gotta go ham :D

I really suggest using Tides of Battle cards in order to keep players away from adopting chesslike strategies.

I am not so convinced by the unexhaustable support ruling. It leads to players occupying a few key locations from where they can support a lots of adjacent territories. This strenghtens the 'turtling tendency'. Which is limiting and hindering the dinamics and dynamism of the game too much for my taste. Yeah I know Web of Lies cards are still there... But granting the unexhaustable ability only for the special support token (marked with the star)creates some interesting choices and situations in my oppinion.

This might be one of my top 3 all time favorite games if there wasn't 1 spot on the board that was so broken IMO.  The patch of water between the Iron Islands and the Lannisters will either be fought over the entire game or those 2 factions have to make some sort of deal immediately.  That one patch of water is so vital to the success of both factions I can't understand how the board made it through play-testing as is... /end rant

Anyway, the game is not as good in my opinion as the sum of it's parts, the sum of it's parts would easily be a 10.  It also doesn't scale well, when played with fewer than the full compliment it leaves a lot to be desired.

I love the theme, but games wind up being frustrating waiting till last rounds. Too long for too little excitement. Playing with special objective variant (for 6 players, for 4 players I am not sure if it is balanced) might get score up by a point.

Great great great strategy game with absolutely no randomnes!
Plays in (for us) 5 hours and is always new, strategy wise, since players shift and houses are drawn randomly.
A great "stab-in-the-back" game with tons of possibilities, plays and theme!
Goes good with vast amounts of red wine and GoT soundtracks!

Acknowledge and respect the design, but I'm simply not great at area control conflict games and kinda dislike open negotiation for the purpose of engaging other players in a fight to domination. Although I have no problem with random, I marginally prefer playing without the Tides of Battle modifier cards, since their exclusion allows tactical selection and bluffing of House cards to shine substantially more.

A good game with quality components and plenty of innovation.

It falls a bit short though in terms of player positioning, as the game just gives a ridicilous amount of position advantage to House Baratheon in a 4 player game. Both games I've played while the other 3 players are scrunched together, Baratheon is given practically the entire lower half of the board to conquer with little opposition to worry about, save from the Lannisters who have plenty to worry about from the other 2 players, one of which is breathing right down their neck.

I've heard there is an expansion that fixes this problem, but until I play it, yeah, definitely lowered the score for me.

Brilliant game design.  Why play Diplomacy ever again as this game has the feel of Diplomacy plus lots or great mechanics to boot.  The supply system is great as is the bidding system.  Downside:  LONG playing time.  Analysis paralysis is a major issue.  Also, balances best with big group (5 or 6 players).  But if you are a strategy game die-hard with a like-minded group to play with, dig in and enjoy.

Such a letdown, and I'm very sad about that. Some of the mechanics (Westeros cards, tiny selection of order tokens) feel artificial and overly game-y, rather than natural expressions of the theme. Very little Westeros flavor, aside from place names and artwork.

Given a table of 6 players who were looking for a game like this, I'd much rather play Dune instead.

RATING: 4
I greatly prefer the first edition over this one, to be honest. Harbours are an excellent addition, and so is the controllable recruit option. Thing is, it's super easy to patch the first edition with those additions.

On the negative side, the map only works with six, the random combat deck just add chaos, and the character cards have a huge influence over battle outcomes, causing a considerable loss of control.

In any case, will play this edition if asked, provided it's without the random combat deck.

Played a three player game and felt the game was not very balanced, i was the center player and was basically attacked non stop from both sides and never really stood a chance. I realise the game is meant to be played at the 6 player count to have the full game experience, but for what I experienced in my first two plays of the game, I do not foresee myself making the time investment of playing a game for 3 hours that I do not enjoy and that was totally unbalanced at all but the 6 player count.

28 pages to read before starting playing its easy to say but for a casual board game player it took a lot of time to learn how to play this game, even though every game mechanic is awesome and once you start playing it get's really simple to understand.

I've just played it once in a game of 4 players, and it seemed a little bit unbalanced, since I took control of the Greyjoys, which are surrounded by Starks and Lannisters, I could do nothing but survive the whole time.

UPDATE: I've played it twice, the second time was in a 5 player game and still seems unbalanced, looks like the Baratheons have the advantage, they've won both games (being played by different persons).

4 players. A very good game and a twist on Risk where instead of amassing a huge army it's more about making the best of a few units and even less commands, working out when the best time is to make a push for victory. The biggest issue with the game is that (apparently) it is best played with 6 players but at that count, the game could take 4-6 hours. Great if you have the time. Not as complicated to play with the right reference material and or video.

Like it or not, the game quite faithfully represents the tone of the original novel/TV series. Back stabbing is the key to victory. Yet, if you play with the same group again, they will carry the past experience to the new game. This is not a game of strategic planning nor tactical battle, but of diplomatic negotiation.

In the second edition of A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, three to six players take on the roles of the great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, as they vie for control of the Iron Throne through the use of diplomacy and warfare. Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!

Great game. Perhaps a bit too tense for my liking and it can lead to 6, 7 hours sessions easily. But it's worth it - unless you are in a position where you are limited in the tracks and can't do anything more than hold off your own. If I could only recommend a game that is best with 6 players it is this one.

RATING: 5.5
So much asymmetry in factions (battle cards) that players are required to study the differences between the factions (especially combat decks) before being able to make intelligent strategic plays, a requirement that I found to be a tedious burden.

So much asymmetry in board position (geography/layout/positioning of board objectives) that perceiving the relative board-advantage/lead of players is difficult and mentally taxing, if not impossible. 

Overall, it's Ameritrash very much in the vein of of Axis & Allies. The only reason I'm willing to play is that there is no dice-rolling or RNG.

Action programming is well-implemented.

It take a little too long for what it delivers, and can be a little less varied/dynamic than is ideal, but it's still a good centrepiece event every now and then.

Because of the map structure players have to be very wary of what the weaker players are doing, and make sure the are playing to counter anyone else taking excessive advantage from this.

I would prefer Rex over this if playing one of them regularly, but would mix them up if it was just the odd game.

Big, wonderful game! Works better with aggressive players and devious plotters (fits the theme, I'd say), otherwise the game can take a while to get going. The combat system is lovely, it forces you to think of the grand scheme before every battle and if played right you can minimize losses from defeats and even benefit from them strategically. Beautiful marbled pieces! For some reason, I totally suck at the bidding phase.

Two things make this game fairly impractical: First it's overly long, second, if scales very poorly and should only ever really be played with exactly 6 players.  When you can line up all the stars though, there's good fun to be had, the theme is strong and there's a very solid war game with a light euro touch underneath.  I think Runewars would probably be my alternative of choice.

A good update to the original game. There are a few minor quibbles that I have. I really like the Leaders from the second expansion from the first edition, and this edition does not include those. I also REALLY do not like the changes to the raid orders that is present in this version. I do however like the additional mustering rule with the consolidate power orders. Having the ports preprinted on the board is VERY helpful, and the decks are all well balanced. Overall a good addition to the Game of Thrones world.

I have long enjoyed the first edition of this game and you can read my comments on that edition for my explanation why.  This version adds some interesting elements from expansions and some new twists.  The ports are a necessary addition - in fact the original version is almost unplayable without ports in my opinion (though one can use port rules without actually having port pieces).  The siege engines are a good addition as well because they make the game less static with their outsized offensive benefit and defense liabilities.  I am neutral on the starred consolidate power token's muster feature.  The wilding cards seem to add an interesting element.  I prefer the old house cards as they make battles less unpredictably swingy (although that could be a benefit if you really know the decks or like a little more chaos).  I have played this version with 5 and find the original board far more balanced for that number of players.

Gain control over the different castles in westeros by forming alliances with different opponents. But these agreements will change during the course of the game and will bring lots of intrigue and depth to the game.

I had one of the best game experiences with game of thrones!

A game best played with the max amount of people and more advanced gamers who are willing to play the game like it was intended to be played.

Second edition!  I am prepared to buy the second edition! The game doesn't see a lot of movements around the board but every move counts! The game is very thematic just like the HBO mini-series: whereas the world of Westeros is as gentle as the sea surface, bloody and treacherous power-plays were weaved underneath.  Every decision you make is still as engaging and impacting the game in the long term. Our group played the game recently and it is still fun after all these years, especially when episode 2 is on the run! A definitional game on the books and TV series!

The similarities with [i]Diplomacy[/i] are evident, which is a sure-fire way of attracting my interest. This game introduces very interesting rules on initiative and stacking. But I don't think the Houses are well balanced, and although the Westeros theme is well implemented, the war theme not so much --- what, castles simply open their gates to enemy forces?

Only one play so can't rate it yet.  I love the theme, board and components.  It's not that hard to teach, but it helps to have players who are into it (and since everyone loves the show, using the theme to teach is usefull.)  Interesting choices with what to do with your armies.  I like the Diplomacy-esque negotiation aspects as well.  Played with 5, Definitely best with 6, and the Greyjoy/Lannister imbalance is felt.

All that said, so far, I prefer Kemet which uses a similar battle mechanic.  Though you miss out on the negotiation/backstabbing

I love this game, but I feel there are some balance issues when you're playing anything but a 6 player game. Starks and Greyjoys always wind up in a huge pissing contest in the north, while Baratheon and Tyrell run around the south (for the most part) unopposed. It also hasn't been unheard of for me to wind up in a 5 hour game, so it's a time investment.

A very good system of a game that fall flat in gameplays.

Its too long for what it is. You have too little actions in the game yet what takes it too long are the book-keeping, negotiating and "actual" combat resolve.

This is my real complain for this game. The negotiation part is acceptable. Its the core mechanic of this game and it would not be the same game otherwise. The book-keeping and resolvation of orders/combat are what really takes too long. 

Imagine thinking about taking 5mins depending on the amount of diplomacy and negotation for your turn to place your orders then having to wait 15-30mins until you get to play again, frustrating is that especially when you dont do any fighting. The combat part also takes too long... to count up the numbers and announce it to people, to negotiate and finally play your cards... far far too long.

(This game could really do well in a digital format, where computer do the book-keeping for you to streamline the experience and shorten the ansolutely boring long waiting time)

The tide of war cards also let the game down with the fact that even the most well laid plan could be twarted, foiled and devastated by random chance.
(But it could very well be removed from that game.)

There are no catch up mechanisms in the game. Once you fall, you fall hard and can only sit there doing random things that don't matter to the gamestate anymore.

The game is rather unfair for some house in a game with less thant he maximum number of people. Some house can easily "farm" the neutral houses in that regard where the others cannot do so as easily.

However, despite a long of complain coming from my ipad, i could point out the very unique flavour of the Game of Throne (books and series) being very much the soul of this game. The designer team surely translate well the spirit of the franchise into the game in a well thought manner.

However, the game itself surely suffer from the actual gameplay that takes too long between turns and various other things.

A digital version of this game would surely be one heck of a game to play but on the analog and manual cardboards"?

Its a nono for me.

I didn't do well in my first game. It was a 6-player game and I was Tyrell who was stuck in a very bitter war against Martell. The Martell player was very weak in that he lost every war against me (he wasn't a good player) and he was also very vindictive as he was unwilling to agree to a truce and just wanted to crush my house (pathetic effort). It was very easy to defend against him but my resources were tied up from round 1 itself so I found it very difficult to expand while Stark, Baratheon and Greyjoy was having a field day coming down south. My point is, this game is very thematic and even though I wasn't doing well, I felt that the tension and frustration happening around the table was very true to each of the houses. However I would love to play this game with better players the next time. :) I'm going to mark this an 8 for now with good potential to go up to 9.

I had so many great hours with this game in my gaming group. There were times when I was happy that they were not my close friends, for I felt like this game could easily destroy relationships. 
Though I really like the game, the time it takes to play it can be way to long. Sadly enough I have not been able to get it to the table in the last year. That definitely makes it less attractive for me at the moment because many aspects I like about it can be found in other games that can be played in a shorter amount of time. 
But if you have time and think that your friends do not care if you stab them in the back from time to time, definitely get it!

For someone who hasn't read the books or watched the TV series the theme doesn't seem particularly evocative to me. However, I really like how they implemented the action planning steps. While the multiple phases for when different tokens activated was confusing at first it flows pretty smoothly once you have a better understanding of what you're doing. I also like how combat is resolved using the character cards (or whatever they're called), as they make combat not deterministic while still being strategic. As always I'm not a fan of secret bidding where you lose money even if you don't win the "auction".

This game is fabulous. The base game is great to learn on but can get dull if you play over and over again. Players can jump right into a better, more tense game by having the A Dance with Dragons expansion or A Feast for Crows expansion. Unfortunately, I own both but have played with neither. I enjoy tinkering with small bits and pieces in this game to change it ever so slightly and vary it. The downside is that people can grow bored of the game as it takes a long time to play.

If you want a war game even if are all players against you, then play this one.
If you are the one who is ignored, you win easily.

What I don't like, how the war is resolved.
You can permanent support your armies in a battle from an adjacent province. Even if the battle is lost, no exhaustion or losing your support units.

My 1st edition comment: "GoT is a lot of fun, with some great mechanics too; the supply system, bidding system, and hidden orders all work together neatly.  The fact that it's nearly completely luckless sealed the deal for me.  It makes the soft-diplomacy really stand out."

Much of that still stands.  This edition incorporates the base game and first expansion of the first edition into one box, which is cool.  The general art, aesthetic, and layout is improved some.  However, the new plastic pieces look like crap.  Give me the wooden units of first edition any day.

Wargame with no dice. Yes please.

Feel kind of stuck in a corner instead of spreading across the map, due I guess to the relatively "short" length for a wargame.

Not really a fan of the making/breaking alliance gameplay, but can be played without.

This really feels like GoT: In order to be successful, you have to make alliances, and then stab your friends in the back!

There is a huge amount of depth in this game. Even though the setup is the same every time, the games play very differently. A lot comes down to the alliances.

Plays best with 6. Don't bring anybody who is afraid of convoluted rules. I did not feel confident in knowing the rules until after 1 or 2 plays.

RATING: 9
You take on the role of one of the great Houses of Westeros.  You can build armies and fleets but are limited by supply.  The combat is card based.  Success is less about Risk-like constant attack and more about maneuver and knowing when to strike for the win.  

There is a heavy dose of diplomacy as well.  

All six houses are represented in this edition.  It has excellent balance with each player count having neutral armies to act as a balancing mechanism.  It is still hard for Lannister to survive.  

Play time can run very long if players do not play combat quickly.  If the playtime was not so long this game would be a 10.

my first game is 6 player game that took 3 hour to finish.

i can`t express how fun is this game ,,, 
if you like area control ,, this game is a must have.
from start to end this game full of thrills that rises from opportunities , betrayals, unfortunate events ...
before playing i had a little concern for the long playing time .
our 2 first rounds took 30 min ,,, so my concern rises a bit more  BUT after round 2 there is so much things to focus that i  don`t even felt passing of time .

by the way my wife didn`t  like this game ... she don`t like games with too much conflict and wars to participate .

highly recommend this game for people that like area control games with aggressive play style

Adds to the feelings that someone is just going to stick a knife in your back at any moment...

A pretty heavy euro-ish war game.  The theme is woven ever so elgantly into the gameplay and it's hard to resist quoting the book/show at certain moments of the game.  Defintely very rules heavy.

Nice game, nice bits, board is too small for amount of icons and size of bits, player shields are way too small. The game itself is nice, but combats are somewhat lackluster as few units actually die from single combats. The game seems to drag a bit.

The game is boring with 3 players, there are so much better games with 3 players my group could play instead of this. 4 player game is EXTREMELY unbalanced, the Grayjoys are too much overpowered for anyone to handle and Baratheon can take over the south with ease and win. 5 player is OK, though the Grayjoys are still the power of the game and the south, although a little bit more difficult for the Baratheons this always happens: greyjoys smash Lannisters(always the underdog, always loses, always last(3-4-5-6 players - ALWAYS)), the lannisters escape to the Tyrels and then Baratheon(like the 4 player game) takes the south for free ...and win). The 6 player version is fine - Grayjoys stil the OP that they are, and Lannister still the weakest they are). GREAT theme though.

I played to my best friend's home. I found it a bit difficult and a play for good players and in particular for the ones that are Games of Trone Fun. It can be advanced if you buy the expansion but it just add a family and some cards that don't make the play more interesting.

I think this game just fired Diplomacy, as the order marker mechanic makes all things clearer, cleaner, and faster.  Plus, the theme is outstanding.

Quite a few rules to learn at the outset, but well worth it.  I just hope I get to play more than once a year!

I love this game.  It captures the intrigue of Westeros perfectly if you play with a willing group.  It's depth of systems is just right, where beginners will be able to grasp things (after some practice) and veterans will constantly forging new tactics.  It's a brilliant game that stands at the top of my collection.

This is the most unbalanced game in the world! Black always wins with 6, black or yellow always win with 4-5(it's kind of a race), and white always win with 3... and red NEVER EVER EVER is higher than last place. What about the rest players? They just sit there for four hours watching instead of playing something else. No!!! A 4 because the idea is great (but very poorly executed) and is somewhat thematic.

Less negotiation and more random and procedural game that I thought before.

I guess tricky mechanics make it more themed, rather successful hybrid. I am still very reserved as it uses a lot of FF beloved mechanics I am not fond of.

RATING: 4
This game just screams unbalanced and random.  That's fine for a filler but painful for a game that can last five or six hours. This game can sometimes be very tight for most of the play time duration, until the last couple rounds when a random card draw allows someone to pull ahead of the pack. Or a game could have a couple runaway leaders because some Houses have an army advantage from the start and if the random card draws don't balance this out then the other players will never be able to catch up, resulting in a king-making situation.

For me, this all means that those first three to four hours don't have any real affect on the game and/or some players may have to sit through them knowing that they have no chance of winning. You are at the mercy of the decks, which could be forced to reshuffle over and over before you ever see a card that helps you. For the most part, I like the mechanisms and interactions, but in a 5- or 6-player game, one or two players are guaranteed to have no chance and will be forced to sit at the table for hours on end. That's just a bad design.

Game of Thrones mini-review:

theme: 10/10
both art and mechanics perfectly capture the feel of the books

mechanics: 8/10
good enough but nothing exceptionally enjoyable or original, barbarian invasions are nice distraction, power gambling is too dull and frequent.

pacing: 6/10
late game rounds take too much time to play out because of the large amount of tokens you are required to place.

duration: 7/10
kinda longish than comfortable, but not as exhausting as other games so I'll let that one pass.

Not balanced at all with odd number of players.
Only works with 4 or 6 players.

While the game is fun and strategic, king making seems to be an issue. It will take more plays for me to fully appreciate the game mechanics, but I didn't instantly fall in love with it.

1.2.2014 Review: 7.5 -> 7.25 More than the game as a whole I enjoyed some of the game mechanisms. These mechanisms have been used in other games (Exodus: Proxima Centauri, Runewars, etc.) for better effects as a whole. Thus GoT is coming down a bit, as it isn't more than the sum of its parts.

A great area control game with all kinds of back-stabbing possibilities. Unfortunately not very balanced in starting positions, especially if one plays with less than 6 players. The expansion feast of crows might make the 4-player experience better.

RATING: 10
An amazing game. It takes the central mechanic of Diplomacy (area control and alliance building), but adds in aGoT theme, a better combat mechanic, and also simplifying all aspects it and cutting time. 

The fun is you're limited with only so many actions (attack, pillage, support, or resource generation). You cant do all you want, which pushes you toward alliance making. Game of Thrones theme shines by claiming titles to gain bonuses, and the threat of Wildlings who if can weaken your forces. The goal is simple, control 10 castles, which evoke RISK, but again, alliance making, and back-stabbing are needed. There are no dice and no luck (besides some card draws), so the game puts you in charge of your own fate. With so much going on, however, it is not a light game at all.

Very well designed game. But has a lot - perhaps too many - moving parts to balance in the face of the need to conduct successful diplomacy. As a result it straddles that awkward line where it encourages deep analysis but leaves you vulnerable to being utterly shafted by random events or inter-player squabbling.

RATING: 8
I have to give this game an 8 just because of the amount you can affect the game's course with your voice. "No don't do that, if you do that he'll do that and you're screwed. Do this instead and I'll even help you out by doing this" you say and laugh evily inside. 

It can get pretty heated though, many of my friends were complaining I was meddling too much in other people's business and after a few hours people got irritated with each other because they were getting hungry, so have a break and eat something is my suggestion.

Takes quite a while to finish and you need to keep an eye out for surprise wins. Don't underestimate the water and siege towers and never hesitate to manipulate your way to victory.

Another game that really shouldn't be played with less than 6. There is an unfair advantage to those in the south who can easily take over neutral territories. 

Overall I really like this game. While there may be some balance issues with some of the houses due to their relatively position to others I think well thought out tactics can overcome this. I kinda wish the game introduced more ally/backstabbing to be closer to the intended theme. All that aside I think the game needs a group who are willing to keep each other in check. If your group tends to play conservatively and tries to avoid confrontation, this game will probably fall flat for you.

If you don't manage to gather 6 players for 3-5 hours, don't bother with this game. But if you do manage to find the players that are not lazy learning the rules - there is quite plenty of them, the game is really well made and fun to play. But my group prefer to use a timer with own time rules (like choosing the fighting character in 60s, placing order tokens in 3-9 minutes, depending on number of units on board and so on to make this game more interactive, since else you might be sitting waiting for 1 player to complete his orders. This game should be played with 6 players, in the worst case 5. If you don't manage to get full team, try some other game.

The game that exposed me to FFG, and still a favorite. The simultaneous placement and revelation of orders is a great mechanic, along with the bidding/influence tracks. 

Part risk, part negotiation, and just the amount of luck I like. Great production value which seems to be a theme with FFG.

Several sessions played and the biggest flaw I can see is the balance really is best with six players.  All the comments about being unable to finish the game in under 5 hours are nonsense. Maybe that long if you've got inexperienced players, or are just doing it wrong.

A very good area control / war game with fantastic theme, and lots of different elements to stay on top of.   Love the closed ordering, bluffing and second guessing as to what commands an opponent is issuing.  Interesting differences in play style for the different houses due to initial board positioning, generals and starting positions in the different influence tracks.  Enjoy the hand management aspects of choosing when to play particular generals.

Very long, but worth it.  With 4 or 5 I'd prefer to play Chaos in the Old World instead, as it is a tighter game that plays quicker.

RATING: 7
This game should be always played with 6 players. It's all about building and breaking alliances and knowing when and where to strike your most exposed enemies (who may very well be the ones you previously allied with). There's a weird form of player elimination, and that can be a huge issue here, because a game can take anywhere between 2 and 5 hours, especially if there are players who suffer from analysis paralysis. I enjoy it, but it heavily depends on the group to work.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It's more than a war game, more than resource acquisition, more than diplomacy: the second edition of A Game of Thrones is very tightly designed, with straightforward game play.

It's a Fantasy Flight game, but it lacks this developer's typical byzantine rules and baroque mechanics. It's actually clean and intuitive. Particularly welcome is the lack of a distracting and heavily abstract phase of "noodling about," which so often appears in Fantasy Flight productions to destroy the flow.

Clean, sharp, intuitive, and extremely fun, this game is a must-have, even if you don't give a whit for the background material.

Finally, while many critics complain about the length, our group of 6 got through its first play in 3 hours, without rushing. If it's taking your group 7 hours, that would be boring . . . then again, it's probably you, not the game. 

We fully expect to have this one down to 2-2.5 hours after a few plays.

Beautiful game.  I warned my friends this would take a while to play the first time but even I was surprised when it went for 8 hours.  The first round took nearly half of that time (including watching the tutorial video).  Some very nice mechanisms that prevent "turtling" and the "winner wins more" elements characteristic of this kind of game.

One player in our game was essentially eliminated halfway through but had to stay at the end.  The game does not reward short-sighted play.

I love A Song of Ice and Fire. The mechanics of this game are good but they don't match the theme at all. I'd simplistically describe the mechanics as "better Risk", allowing for more diplomacy and tension. However, the core idea of the rules remains, as in Risk, expanding your territories across a map. This isn't representative of A Song of Ice and Fire: in the books the houses don't expand their territories then grind against one another at the borders. Furthermore, the game requires the players to self-balance it through diplomacy, doesn't work for anything less than 6 players and, rather than building to an exciting climax, just ends after turn 10. It's a good rules system but a poor game. For how to adapt a beloved fantasy book into a good board game, see War of the Ring.

My personal all time favorite. Speaks to the general, politician, diplomat, and economist in me. Some people may not like it because you actually have to work to win.

This is a strategists game.

RATING: 6
Based on multiple playthroughs with 6 players. There is a good game in there, just not as it stands. I like the wildlings tracker, I like the simple effective combat (didn't play the optional random card drawing) and I like the design and presentation of the game. 

If you play with the 10 turn limit I feel it is too short to play a long term plan, alliances break as soon as they're formed and, a few turns from the end you kind of know if you're in a position to win, if you're not and a larger foe wants some support you really are just helping them win with no advantage to yourself. Playing without the turn limit (done so twice) means far too long a game but with more planning and meaningful deals to be done between players. I feel there must be an in between option where this game would shine.

As a fan of the TV serie I was expecting to like the game, and it's good but not great for me. I like the euro elements in the game, said the power, supplies and wildlings tracks and the secret deployment of actions. However the game is too long and has a lot of conflict, too many pacts and tricks, the houses are unbalanced since the beginning as in the story but it's sad that the game seems to work well only with 6 players. I´d play it again.

In this line of strategic games with combat and a nice theme I prefer Kemet, a great game with a very streamlined ruleset, plays faster and works ok from 2 to 5 persons.

One note:
I do not play without a following houserule:
The Riverrun is not connected to sea around Pyke Islands.
Prove me wrong but without it it is just mathematically impossible to lose a rush against Lannister as Greyjoy - 2nd ed. cards.
The overall Lannister situation is my one and only complaint about this game. They are literally screwed. Of course in a game of backstabbing diplomacy such as this they also can win, but while I feel confident that I can always win playing any other faction, the Lannister can only count on favourable geopolitical situation.

Nevertheless, one of my favourites, I just love this game, and I never say no to playing it.

This game makes me want to start punching people as soon as it hits the table. No other games does that.

I'll give you an example of a set of rules that I think feels the same as this game:
- Each player writes "rock," "paper," or "scissors" on a piece of paper.
- Each player then chooses either the player to his left or to his right to be his target.
- The pieces of paper are then revealed.
- Sit around a move a bunch of plastic and cardboard for 20 minutes.
- If you beat your target, you get 1 point. If someone else targeted you and beat you, you get -1 point.
- If you get -1 points 2 turns in a row, you lose, but you can't leave the table.
- Repeat these steps until all but one person has lost or it has been done 10 times.

Elegantly incorporates many of the best elements of the original game and expansions.  Scaling down from 6 players can be an issue, so if you have the 1st Edition board keep it; if you don't, find the southern map overlay on BGG and use it for 5-player games.  Combine the 2nd Edition with the Storm of Swords 1st Edition expansion for more options, including leader units and a strong alternate 4-player board, to create the ultimate experience.

Area-dominance wargame with forced cooperation events and hidden bidding for variable-power advantages that plays best with six players. High degree of direct player interaction and a deceptively rich array of strategic options that spells long down-time while waiting for other players, especially those AP-prone. Allows player elimination. Long session times of four to six hours.

Houserules:

Setup:
Lannister starts with 1 footman and a +5 garrison in King's Landing.

Rules:
Only 1 ship from each sea zone can support a land battle.

Garrisons are not units and can't place orders.

When fighting neutrals, both sides use a house card (random card for neutrals) and both get a TOB card. After battle, neutral gets card house card back.

Keeps give +1, Castles give +2.

Iron throne can pass on first action. Determines all non-combat ties (including game end).

Valerian Steel Blade can let you draw a 2nd TOB card (keep the best one) instead of the +1 bonus at the end of battle.
If used to support another battle, it must be declared as part of the support phase.

Raven lets you look at any one upcoming event card and switch an order token with one from your supply or another one from the board.

You can always scuttle one of your own units at anytime during the game.

Remember: Wildlings start at 2. When retreating, you may only retreat to one (legal) zone. Routed units can still defend (but at power 0). If defeated again, they die (since routed units can't retreat).

RATING: 7.5
I want to love this game so bad. I love the theme, I've read all the strategy guides and I like how deep this is. Unfortunately for my group, I think I would need several plays in order to reach those higher levels of strategy.

In our first game, the negotiations were kept to a minimum since many players were hesitant (as to be expected) and timid.

This is an area control game where the asymmetry is due to the geographic locations of the houses and the house decks.

Must play with 6 players only!

I also use the T6 setup and card changes from DWD expansion.

Pretty good variation of Diplomacy, with variable powers and some nice additions. Some strategy decisions, some diplomacy, some supply. Had a good time playing. 

Played again 2016 with James, Marc and Jacco.  I managed a strong win in turn 7.  Units look nicer in this edition, and the randomizing of the battle cards seems to be necessary to me.  The theme does nothing for me, though, and the wildings attacks feel a bit lame.

Was very much looking forward to playing it. My first game was very enjoyable (we finished early on turn 7), but the second time we played the full game (all experienced gamers) and it was one of the most intense ~5hrs of my life. And looking back, it was also fairly boring ~5hrs of my life, as the game had far less interaction to what I expected (only played with 2 adjacent players really in a constant back and forth). I'm not terribly keen to play it again as I'd very much prefer a 4 player Through the Ages instead (or Eclipse or or ... lots of other long games out there).

RATING: 6
Strong thematic game. It plays a bit like Risk, but without the dice. Say what? It has the hidden simultaneous move mechanics and it's basically a war game about using resources to build an army to win, but without dice there is absolutely no randomness and winning relies more on your strategy and negotiating skills -- the game rewards players who can bluff, negotiate and betray their opponents to get favorable board position.

The main drawback of this game is that it is slow, cumbersome, requires way too much bookkeeping and takes some really dedicated time to play. The players also need to absorb a lot of complexity as the mechanics are not very streamlined, but this gives the game depth at least.

Nice light (or maybe, more accurate would be "not so heavy"? XD) wargame. You really needat least 4 with this, 3 doesn't cut (and while at 4 it works fine, I take 5 whenever I can) with 4/5 you're looking at about 3 hours if everybody knows what they are doing, so it's not THAT long. 

Something to note: I've always felt the Lannister player is at a disadvantage when the game begins (position-wise), if 5 or 6 are playing.

If you like boardgames and you like A song Fire and Ice (or is it the other way around? I always mix them XD) you need to give this a shot 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A brilliant war-game with intense diplomacy and the order reveal phase creates genuine tension as you wonder whether your opponent has chosen to strike this round. 

The core mechanics heavily based on those in diplomacy are excellent; other parts of the game feel a bit tacked on and it would have been nice if these areas were more fleshed out but maybe this helps to keep the focus on the war-game at the heart of this game.

Aside from that, definitely use the "Intrigue" variant where you have a phase of sending secret messages to one another before the planning phase as it really spices up the game.

Lots of ingredients I like, but with additional negotiation, backstabbing, and semi-cooperation. Why not just play Dominant Species? This will appeal more to theme lovers. Like other asymmetric games of this style, any player who knows their faction, or yours, better than you will likely stomp you, and when you know yours well enough you'll follow the scripted strategy and opponent selection. Not for me.

Felt too long for what it offered and has fiddly, artificial systems.   That being said, I am a fan of the source material so it wasn't terrible - but there are too many other games I'd rather play Dune or even Kingmaker (which despite being almost 40 years older is more elegant).  For what it's worth, I only played one six player game.  Also, this second edition has much muddier pieces, I much prefer the first.

Mixed feelings... Not sure how i feel about this game. It implements it's theme in great detail. However, the overall game can leave some players behind with little meaningful things to do. Games also tend to evolve towards a "kingmaker" moment, where 2 or more players sit on the cusp of victory only for the winner to be decided by other players with no chance "choosing" who to give the win to (or allow to win). I really dislike that kind of endgame.

RATING: 9
Use your armies to expand your lands, armies and power to control most victory areas in Westeros.

Plays: More than 50.
Type: Thematic Wargame = a theme-driven game where you move military forces on a map to destroy other military forces and/or conquer territory. Area movement style. Strategic scale.
Complexity: Medium wargame.
# of players: 6.
Playing time: 300 mins.
Player interaction: Conflict and Diplomacy.
Randomness: Low – card draw, but cards have global effects that you can prepare for.

Replayability: Very high. The assymetrical starting positions just beg for repeated plays to explore the strategies of the different houses. Every game will be different depending on the diplomatic balance. There is also depth to explore.
Fun: I’m a big fan of multi-player wargames in general and of simultaneous order selection in particular, and this is a home run for me. So much fun with diplomacy and backstabbing, and the perfect theme to go with such a game. Even more fun now that more people know the backstory from the TV-series.
Memorability: Very high. You’ll definitely remember the alliances made and broken and the shifting fortunes of war. The theme shines here as well, making it sound like you’re part of the novels (or the TV-series) when you regale your friends with the tale of your latest victory.

Thematic integration: Very high.
Components: Very good. The map of Westeros is gorgeous and the pieces and chits are of good quality with good art.

Who will like this: Gamers that want a multi-player wargame need look no further. The theme is icing on the cake for those that like it, but you don’t need to to enjoy the game.

Long time fan of the original edition...

What I like more about this version: The Westeros Phase addition of giving special abilities to the three title holders added a new and interesting metagame component.

What I strongly dislike about this version: the new combat cards, and the new fate cards used in combat. It makes combat go from a vicious plannable knife fight of second-guessing to a roll of the dice. If I wanted randomness in my combat, I'd play Risk.

Basically a more complicated version of Diplomacy.  First time I played it, I didn't realize there was a regular move that most people do to seize Lannisport.  So, I lost Lannisport in the first turn and spent the next 5-6 hours with no chance to win.  Tried it again a second time with slightly better results, but still felt it was a waste.

A game with no opportunity to come back from behind and that is entirely based on back-stabbing just isn't my definition of fun.

RATING: 7
The books, Tv show and board game are equally over rated it would appear. Don't get me wrong, there good or to be more accurate very decent. With 5 players the game is excellent, 4 it's alright, with 3 it's a pig (avoid). This problem would of been avoided by giving players extra areas on the map on set up. Any player that start next to a board controlled player will always win unless there a complete buffoon. The card combat feels slow and awkward. The wildling attacks don't really seem like a true danger to the land. With the right amount of players (5) the game is a fun challenge, I've just noticed how my group spends a lot of time talking about ways the game could of been better. Solid, fun five player game.

Finally got to play this one and I was honestly pretty disappointed.  I really wanted to like it.  We played a 6 player game with 5 new players and it took about 6 hours (plus teaching).  That's just too long for what it is.  I spent a large part of that time without a lot to do.  I played Tyrel (Green) and felt like they had a really tough starting position.  There's just enough rules to be pretty confusing most of the game.  There were a few things I had to ask about nearly every turn.  Just didn't feel very intuitive to me.  The actions really felt like a big rock/paper/scissors game which I often enjoy in lighter fare but not in a game of this length.  I guessed wrong a lot.  Several times when I finally built up enough troops to try to attack somewhere I got screwed by a card even though I had the greater forces.  It's what seems typical of Fantasy Flight Games.  Great art and production, but I just don't enjoy what I like to call "the whammy cards."  I guess once you get to know the game well enough you can try to plan around them, but I honestly don't think I care enough to play this several times.  We didn't play up the negotiation much and that might improve and balance the game but I just didn't enjoy it enough the first time.  For supposedly having such a luck-less game, it sure felt chaotic to me.  Blind bidding.  Rock/Paper/Scissors style combat, both in the order playing, and the combat resolution.  It's not what I call strategy to have to guess what the other person is going to do.  Fun in a shorter game.  Perhaps that's where negotiation comes in. But it's gonna be a long while before I feel up to giving this another chance I'm afraid.

I love 'em cutthroat.  The betrayal is superb as long as the players involved can be flexible enough to know that when it's done, it's not personal.  I think this is a great game to roleplay your faction and when everyone is on board, it's a blast!  That being said, one person who takes it personal or doesn't understand the betrayal mechanic can sour the whole experience.

My gripe is minor: there's so much that goes onto the board that it can be overwhelming sometimes, especially in 5 or more player games.  I kind of like the stress but I see it crack others because they get that analysis paralysis and make mistakes.  I just take it in stride.  You don't get a free pass beyond the pearly gates just because you won a game.  Sit back and enjoy.  If you're overwhelmed, simplify your actions & betray.  It makes for great surprises.

I love the hidden selection mechanic... I love Negotiation... I obviously love the theme... it was about time I played this one!

And it was a great game... so many agonizing decisions, trying to outguess the other Houses, some Alliances made, some Alliances shifted...

From what I saw I think I will like this way of play much better than the original one... I prefer the Hidden Objectives to the Controlling Castles end game... I feel it's more thematic and much more fun trying to accomplish hidden agendas in this game than just straight out controlling 7 Castles...

Also, I think the game will be a little bit faster this way because it's much harder to bash the leader in this game because you can't be sure of what he's trying to accomplish to score his objectives... you can try to prevent them from scoring the one that everyone knows about but the other 3 he has it's a different story...

RATING: 7
+.5 has depth and a feeling of balancing lots of things...but also has a weight and complexity to match
+1 various paths to victory work well
+1 several mechanics (forced cooperation, encouraged scheming/plotting, and bidding for powers) add a good social/bluffing element. 
+1 Combat feels high-stakes and dangerous; and units feel valuable due to limited army size, infrequent recruiting and delayed reveal of actions/counter-actions
+.5 artwork / theme done well


-.5 Very unbalanced...but this is mitigated somewhat by the plotting/backstabbing that results, which in itself feels very game of thrones-y. (Bug or feature?) 
-.5 much less enjoyable with 3 as the balance issues are magnified greatly. 
-1 rule complexity was more than enough to put at least one of my groups off giving it a second run-through, and the rule book could've been a lot better. 

A great big-box wargame for exactly 6 weighty-game lovers to sink their teeth into. I have a feeling my ratings of this game may change if I get the right group around it.

Now THIS is a war game.*  Combat is deterministic but players can keep aspects secret.  Combat mostly results in troop disbursement rather than outright troop loss.  So the game is more about negotiation, diplomacy, and betrayal rather than about outright aggression.  A blast to play, even if you haven't read the books or seen the show.

A superb "in your face" pumped [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/483/diplomacy]Diplomacy[/url], with the usual FFG components quality. It's an overall light experience (check event cards, give orders - like in [url=StarCraft]Starcraft[/url], resolve fights, rinse&repeat), but it's a good one with a light audience in mind.
The theme owns everything from the Wars of the Roses plus some generic fantasy bit (dragons, evil ice race, blood magic...), but again, it's ok.

RATING: 2.5
One of my greatest boardgame disappointments. A game where the very mechanics allow players to fight together against the winner, who got ahead by his strategy on his own, seems a lot unfair - and that's far from the only unfair mechanics. For example, in the supplies, it doesn't really matter AT ALL how much supplies you hold in the long term, or how much you gained or lost - it only matters in the extremely rare and totally unpredictable moments, when the supplies are calculated and updated.
Plus, later turns rather drag on, with all the units that need their orders.
The opening setup is heavily unbalanced, maybe in lieu of the story, but since I am a fan of board games and not of the GoT series, my total opinion is "no, thanks".

Plus, the only board game that GUARANTEES some heavy and evil quarrels among the players.

Úristen, zseniális!! Én nagyon szeretem a sorozatot, lehet ez is segített, de nagyon élveztem a játékot! Oké, a társaság is jó volt..
Viszont jelentős ráfordítást igényel: 6 fő (úgy az igazi), és sok szabadidő. Nekünk 4,5 óra + 1 óra szabálymagyarázat volt az első játék. Viszont végig lekötött!!
Egyelőre a diplomácia részét nem annyira aknáztuk még ki, inkább támadtunk ezerrel, és próbáltuk a saját akaratunk érvényesíteni. Végül én nyertem (1 híján meglett a 7 vár az utolsó fordulóban), és érzésem szerint a megszerzett vagyonom döntött. Nagyon értékesek a liciten szerezhető privilégiumok, ezért a pénz egy fontos erőforrás. Ó és a csaták, ki hova támad, de ő meg támogat és.. ÁÁÁ, nagyon jó!
Nagy örömömre egyik barátomnak meg van, így már nem kell gondolkodnom a beszerzésén (egyelőre :P). Sajnálom, hogy ekkora befektetést igényel, mert így nehéz összehozni egy partit.

Unfortunately will not receive 10 because it is too long and therefore, hard to hit the table.

Quien es fanático de Juego de Tronos puede sentir que este juego se acerca a lo que es ese factor de no saber quien está de tu lado o en contra de la serie (libros y tv). Pero, para lograrlo emplea mecánicas de juego que no necesariamente son fáciles de manejar, está diseñado para jugadores duros. 
Otro aspecto, es que se siente mucho mejor con los 6 jugadores pero ahí lleva a que esa ese tipo de juegos que dura muchísimo. Claramente no es un TI, donde tienes n factores que sientes que desde el inicio al fin tu imperio ha crecido notablemente (tecnologías, estrategias, tropas, etc.), aquí terminas con los mismos elementos con los que empezó el juego, así que al final de 3 horas, ganaste pero sin sentirte muy superior a los demás, más que controlar terreno. Ojo, para Juego de Tronos, no es necesario controlar otros factores más que terreno y ser el amo del Trono de Hierro, pero luego de tantas horas invertidas me gustaría ver crecer a los personajes, tal como los hijos Stark en la serie.
Fuera de eso, juego sólido, momentos épicos en las batallas, recomendable para un grupo de personas con tiempo y que amen a GoT (que ahora hay muchos!)

Again, I'm not a dudes on a map guy. This game is basically Risk. Meh. The only redeeming part I liked is that your troops aren't necessarily destroyed when you lose a battle.

RATING: 4
Game of Thrones is an uneven area-control war-game that wishes it was more of a diplomacy game then it actually is.

Its very long (always 3+ hours), most of which is spent grinding against adjacent opponents over the same mutually neighbouring spaces. The winning condition will almost never be met, and most games will finish when the game ends after 10 long rounds.

The combination of secret actions, restricted army building and remaining combat ability being open knowledge makes the game incredibly unforgiving.

Players will attack each other through paranoia, alliances are difficult to make as other players will gang up on the alliance, and with awkward number restrictions on army pieces you can often be outnumbered and overwhelmed from several sides at once, whilst at the same time always feeling like you are short of the troops you need.

King making and surrender monkeys can also spoil any satisfaction of a hard earned victory.
  
Guess the above things make quite a strong argument that FFG nailed the tone of GoTs. Thing is this overall feel leaves me feeling depressed and constrained as a result.

Only ever play with the full 6 players, or 5 players if you can use the 1st edition 5 player board. Playing with less vastly over/under powers the remaining colours who are suddenly left with huge areas of extra space to control.

Having played Game of Thrones twice now I think its one of the best large scale board games around. It's super complex and very strategic (very little luck involved). Make sure you are playing with friends that don't take things personally. Just like the TV series back stabbing happens a lot and with the influence system if someone with power is against you watch out...

RATING: 5
If you enjoy dealing as much with the interface as with your opponents, AGoT is your game. If you enjoy random mustering, supply, and order restrictions, AGoT is your game. If you enjoy an utter absence of any kind of meaningful negotiation or diplomacy--aside from quoting the books non-stop--AGoT is your game. If you enjoy House cards that act sometimes as super-gotchas and alternately as dreck, AGoT is your game. If you enjoy being constrained by a narrow and crowded map with few options to maneuver....need I go on?

Beautiful production. Shame about the design, which is an FFG hallmark.

An absolutely incredible game filled with strategy, alliances, and betrayal.  I have a hard time coming up with a single thing about this game that I don't like.  The ONLY gripe I have is that I really don't care for the optional "Tides of Battle" cards, as they can spoil the climax of the game in a very unsatisfying way.  I simply do not play with that optional rule and the game is in my opinion perfect.

I played board games like Axis & Allies and Shogun with my brother and a couple of friends when I was younger but I really haven't touched them for going on 20 years now. That all changed however, when on a whim I decided to pickup the second edition of AGoT. What have I been missing all this time??? 

It really is a great game.

The "A Dance with Dragons" expansion deck makes for a shorter, bloodier game.

This represents one of the first hybrid designs to mix ameritrash with euro-styled mechanics to create an enagaging experience.

The world of Westeros is used as the backdrop here and up to 6 can play. 6 is still the preferable number of players but some decent rules allow neutral realms to function fairly well in the game. 

The play is governed by needing to control provinces that offer power and strongholds.

Power is used in the blind-bidding auctions, which control turn order, tie-breaks in combat and strategic benefits. 

Strongholds determine how many new units can be mustered in a given region. 

Combat in the game is purely based on total unit strength rather than any randomised dice rolling, but the inclusion of Support rules between players with adjacent provinces introduces an almost Diplomacy level of negotiation and backstabbing.

Whilst the game's length is controlled by a set number of maximum turns (8) a game can still take between 2-4 hours, with a length closer to 4 hours being more likely. 

I really wanted to like this game but in truth i don't dig the nature of combat and the blind bidding. 

For me this game really requires the right mix of players that fully understand the system and can play at a decent clip.

Lannister seems unbalanced & nearly impossible to win with. Also, the 4-player mechanic seemed to be broken: others will have to side aggressively against Baratheon, otherwise he/she will just walk around and take the free castles around the Baratheon area. 

Also, after 3 games with two different groups there has basically been zero negotiation/deal-making/other diplomatic stuff. It's almost as if the game forces you to curl up and be extremely cautious, despite the backstabby theme. This kind of pecks away the feel a bit and also prolongs the game. So rating down from 9 to 8 because of this.   

Still an excellent game, albeit a tad too long. I'd recommend it only with 5-6 players.

An improved version of risk with the Game of Thrones flavor. You have cards you use to give you bonuses in battle which adds an extra element of strategy to the basic risk mechanics.

A Diplomacy/Dudes-On-A-Map hybrid that is less abstract than many games in either of these genres. This is the game you can pull off the shelf if you wanna scratch the "Diplomacy" itch, but have nobody to play it  with (=whimps!). For me, Diplomacy being my favourite game, this is a fun alternative, that puts a little less focus on the diplomacy aspect (so still a lot of negotiation compared to other games) and adds some fun and thematic mechanisms. For fans of the series, this is the ultimate Westeros experience.

Es el típico Risk actual en el que durante 4 horas te das de tortas hasta que un jugador está a punto de ganar. En ese momento el resto de jugadores se unen para reducirlo y termina ganando el que iba segundo.

A good new edition but not a perfect one. Unfortunately the weak starting position of Lannister was not changed. The game works perfect with 6 players, but I do not think that the use of neutral force tokens is a good way to play with fewer than 6 players. Baratheon and Tyrell are getting to strong in this setup. Kept my old Edition with expansions.

What a waste of a good IP. Take an old, dry-as-dirt game like Diplomacy, try to update it for the modern age, and that is what Game of Thrones: The Board Game is. The theme for this game could have literally been anything. There's almost no Game of Thrones flavor, and all the major characters are just backdrops to what is a game of moving three kinds of units across a board. If I want to play an area control game this basic, I'll just play El Grande. If I want something more thematic and/or complex, I'll go with Blood Rage or Dominant Species. Also, I hate games that force you to negotiate. If I'm going to negotiate, I'd rather it happen organically.

This is the most strategic game I've played in a while, it's a hard game to master and there's a steep learning curve but don't be put off by this, it's a very rewarding game to accomplish and to play, when it's well played it really makes you think and that's what I love the most about it, you have to calculate your attacks, your bids, your defenses, when to move and when to hold ground, everything really well thought because your opponents will also do so.
There's a variety of mechanics in the game and they all get along great, the wildlings, the influence tracks, the combat, the bidding system, you have to master all this in order to succeed in conquering the Seven Kingdoms.

RATING: 2
Perhaps you need to be a fan of the books to appreciate this game. There is nothing original in the gameplay but rather an ordinary battle game with Game of Thrones pasted on it, with the main difference that the mechanisms seem to have been chosen to fit the theme rather than to add value to the game.

Battles are fought with special ability cards, which means that you need to know the cards to increase your odds of winning. Diplomacy is limited since the players cannot support each other. Player control is limited too since you are dependent on random events to build your kingdom or army. And what's the point of the wildings? Pay to avoid damage for all? Why pay at all?

My first (and only) game had four phases:

1. Grab the empty land
2. Wait, since you couldn't attack your neighbor without expose yourself to your other neighbor
3. Attack in the second to last turn to end up biggest
4. If the attack didn't succeed, take on the kingmaker role and attack the one you don't want to win

If you like diplomacy, play Diplomacy instead, and if you like random battles, play RISK instead.

Takes a long time to play.  Way too many little rule details.  Definitely a hard game to get to the table.  Despite all those things, it's FUN.  The game is completely worth it for those moments when everyone flips over their order tokens and you find out just how much you are going to be helped/screwed.

EDIT: Fun game, but too long to get played very often. Sold my copy.

I like this game.As I say it is "pure,dry strategy".No dice to decide who wins a battle.Just make the right strategic moves,keep the right hero cards,so when the battle comes you cannot lose.That is Game of Thrones.You must keep track of everything as a good general.Your supply,your armies,your support armies,when to train new army,when you'll upgrade some of your army,will I raid?,will I defend?,will I support?,what the opponent has in mind?,even who wins the battle if it is a tie,everything.And the three influence tracks that keeps changing now and then?Wow that is a whole other "war" in the backstages.The backstabings that you have in this game reminds you what A Game of Thrones really means.It gets you into the theme right away.Fantasy Flight did a great job once again with the components.A very thematic game and a good strategy.

Principales critiques: 

A) Des amis y ont joué 10 fois (à 3, 4, 5 et 6 joueurs): 10 victoires des Baratheon!; 

B) La "Westeros Phase": Une partie dure plusieurs heures, et généralement, "hasard" et "longues parties" ne s'arriment pas bien ensemble. C'est un peu ce que je reproche de la "Westeros Phase": Une bonne idée peut s'avérer mauvaise, ou vice-versa, selon les cartes d'événements "Westeros" qui seront dévoilées à chaque tour (1).

C) J'aime l'aspect "diplomatique" du jeu, mais ceci peut à la fois allonger terriblement la durée de la partie, et ne s'adapte pas si bien dans des parties avec 3 (ou même 4) joueurs. Comme une partie a un nombre de tours limités, il est difficile de réagir suite à une trahison... Tout le contraire du jeu Diplomacy!


(1) - Première partie jouée (4 joueurs, avec les Stark): Impossible pour moi d'acquérir des Power Tokens. Il est vrai que j'ai peut-être exécuté un mauvais déplacement au Tour 1 (m'éloignant d'une case "Supply"), mais le fait que la carte "Supply" du Westeros Phase ait été dévoilée aux tours *1 et *2 de la partie a fait en sorte que je n'ai jamais pu augmenter mon score à ce niveau. J'ai donc été passif toute la partie dans les votes et l'influence.

Deuxième partie jouée (3 joueurs, avec les Stark): Cette fois, ce sont les cartes "Mustering" (recrutement de troupes) puis "Put to the Sword" (impossibilité d'assigner des ordres de défense), dévoilées au coeur de la partie mais à un bien mauvais moment pour moi, qui ont grandement altéré la suite de la partie...

Game of Thrones in a box.  The only thing preventing me from making this a 10 is that is does take 6 hours (more with new players) and without variants pretty much requires 6 players.  I don't mind longer games, but it does require you to plan a day around it or sacrifice playing 2 deep Euro games instead.  Variants can get around the balance issues with fewer than 6 players.

However, nearly everything else about this game is amazing.  Given the time, I would play this over almost anything else.  It is a fantastic example of merging euro mechanics with theme, negotiation, and backstabbing.  I also can't imagine a better game for the theme.

The four player version of this game is completely unbalanced, apparently unplaytested garbage. It looks like the 5 player will be as well, though I haven't tried it yet.

to publish a 3-6 player game that simply doesn't work with fewer than six, in large part due to some stupid changes (addition of several neutral castles/strongholds in one part of the board only really accessible to 1 or 2 players, the inclusion of siege engines that can be used in that part of the board), is simply unacceptable.

RATING: 7
I have not watched the television show, and I made it 3/4 of the way through the first book before hurling it away in disgust.  Nonetheless, I really enjoy playing this game. It reminds me of so many games that I played as a teen -- zero-sum, power games with much pleading and ganging up and cursing of bad rolls.  The map is quite beautiful and well-thought out as far as forcing certain types of conflict and movement.  There is the usual down-time when an individual player is taking their turn and moving / resolving battles with some other player.  However, for THAT style of game, this one is fun.

Now, that said, I've only played with 6 players.  Also, I do think that the game suffers from a bit of fiddliness in its rules and more importantly from the fact that a player can get pummeled to the point where they are basically out of the game...and there might still be 2 hours of game to play through!  In fact, this has happened in every game that I've played.  There are 3 or 4 players who are clearly duking it out, 1 or 2 that *might* be able to sneak out a victory, and 1 who has been crushed long before the game is over.  But hey, in this style of game...an area control configuration that requires taking territory from others and repelling their attempts to take territory from you.  It's a game in which luck and player alliances play a role, so I don't see how games won't have that odd-person out.  (Btw, I have no patience for the folks who want to take the "luck" out of the game by eliminating the battle cards.  Suck it up and save your lamentations for other games.  This ain't a Euro!)

However, like I say, all-in-all this game provides a tense, epic all out struggle between kingdoms that have very slight, but very nice, unique styles of play connected with them.  I've been that pummeled player, and during those times the game is less fun.  I've been the almost victor, and during those times the game was exhausting, satisfying, and oddly anti-climactic..mainly because everyone else ends up slightly pissed off.  

Anyway, friends who know the fictional story say that this game captures the narrative quite well.  FFG seems pretty good at that.  Me, I don't know the story, and what I encountered, I did not enjoy.  The game, though, I do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A bloated Dune-inspired "conquer the map" extravaganza. If it feels like an already complicated game with one too many expansions dumped on top, is because that's pretty much what it is. As this 2nd edition consolidates the previous edition's most notable expansions in the same box.

Thus, you have 2 separate phases of bidding over event and conditions, there are 5 different tracks of conditions to keep your eye on, and combat has 4 separate interlocking mechanics that try to brute-force hidden actions, unit placement, special powers and luck of the draw in a single abominable element.

I love ameritrashers, but GoT is easily one of FFG's most bloated and unbearable games. Its a festival of excess that collapses under its own weight and lacks the ingenuity of the games it tries to emulate.

I suspect my rating will go up with a few more plays.  I had no idea what I was doing, but enjoyed a first play.  I don't feel I can rate this yet until I have had a chance to play it more and truly understand what is going on.

Second Play:  Experience matters here and it can be an unfun game if you play with someone who has played the game multiple times and knows the typical opening moves. Once they get their engine going it is almost impossible to stop them.  I think there is a good game here and thematically this hits all the right notes.  Just need to play with a balanced set of players at the table.

Glad I've played it, but wouldn't play again. There's nothing new in it, and it took far too long.

Chaotic, slow, no real strategy that I can see, no multiple ways to win, distinct lack of catch-up mechanisms, pointless screwage, random king-bashing, random king-making, you just keep doing the same things over and over again, with often a net result of zero. You have little interaction with two or three of the other five players. It's like over-complicated Risk bascally.

And... there's no story to it, no phases to speak of, and very little relation to Game of Thrones it seems, other than a few names.

GoT has among the greatest area control strategy mechanics ever devised, and drips with flavour from the famous book series, but in practice it also suffers from some mild balance issues, and certain elements of randomness can leave you starved for necessary resources. Expansions offer some variation to change up the basics, but the Feast for Crows four-player scenario almost completely repairs the flaws of the base game (while tragically placing an extremely stringent 4-players-exactly requirement on the game). 

Approved.

This game is so unbalanced that I will never play it again.

Especially the House Greyjoy is hugely disadvantaged against the Lanisters from the south and the Starks from the North. I played with house Greyjoy and couldn't do much, totally crushed with little or no choice what to do next. Game lasted forever about 5 hours with 4 players with no real chance to get back on my feet. I just waited for others to finish their actions.

The mechanics are great and I like the way how combat and units work but when a game is so unbalanced as this it gets very irritating and boring when you just spectate while others play.

First play was quite the undertaking. I have high hopes for this one. I feel the game requires a lot of table talk to keep it interesting. 

This game needs aggressive players. In the two plays under the belt, there has been a lot of hesitance for players to expand.

This game does a really good work in depicting the intrigue in books. The game is very simple to explain, the rules that appear very difficult at first, turn out to be very simple. 
For me this does not receive a higher rating because of two factors:
- the amount of time it takes to play, and if you have AP people in your group this game becomes excruciatingly slow;
- the game seems unbalanced when playing with fewer than 6, needing variants to fix it.

Also, if one of your group members holds grudges from people when they betray them in games, don't play this game!

It is really god game and in the past I played it a lot, but since then I met better games and maybe once a year I'm playing GoT. Still, I recommend it strongly, especially for the fans of GoT or strategies. It hurts your brain, but playing it gives satisfaction :P.

Far too long and far too fiddly. Downtime between turns is an absolute killer. This game has been superseded by Runewars in every possible way. The thematic constraints also don't do any favours to this design (eg. needs 6 players, same map board every time, etc.).

Not much to say yet but this: acquired in April 2012 and FFG seems to have fixed the board-warping issue. Mine lies perfectly flat.

Just finished playing a 5 player game. It was terribly imbalanced. 3 players thrown into a frenzy while two players had all the freedom to explore and grow.

Even through it's the 2nd ed., this game needs a LOT of work to be balanced. It's barely playable unless you have exactly 6 players.

A very good war game with lots of tention. Neither I nor players from my group have played games similar to this, so the level of play and especially negotiation were on a somewhat low-medium level. I am sure this game will grow on me as I see its potential and I hope to try it out again soon.

RATING: 7
A Game of Thrones is a great war game at the 3-player level, but suffers from severe balance issues at 4 & 5 players.

The 4-player's game balance is atrocious. The addition of the Greyjoy faction provides a thorn in the side of both the Stark and Lannister families, but leaves Baratheon untouched. Plus, the 4-player setting opens areas to the south that were previously locked off easily within reach of the Baratheon player.

A 5-player game is still unbalanced. The 5th player plays the Tyrells which add a bit of competition for the Baratheons in the south, but play for the Lannisters is worse than ever as they're the only faction easily able to be attacked by all 4 other families.

Balance is restored on a 6-player game although combat is still limited to a faction's nearest neighbors. Lannisters remain the punching bag they were in the 5-player game, but at least the addition of the Martells draws some of the Tyrell and Baratheon attention.

Recommendations for 4 & 5 player games: 

4) Play Lannister, Baratheon, Tyrell, and Martell and keep all territories above the neck locked out to balance the game out.

5) Keep Pike locked out. Play a Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, Tyrell, Martell game and voila! balance is restored.

aGoT is a long game though that can afflict players with analysis paralysis, so it will likely dominate an entire gaming evening.

The port rules are overly complicated. Also, the player elimination problem is a problem. The game strongly encourages the houses to gang up and tear apart the weakest player(s). In our last six person game, one person was eliminated and the other player lost all of their strongholds (but kept some units so they could choose a winner to the game. Not a very satisfying end to the game).

There is much to like about this game - great for the nights you have 5-6 people (or 4 if you have the expansion). I especially like that so much of the planning is done simultaneously amongst the players - you do not have to wait around for each player as each person is planning their actions at the same time.  Resolution of the decisions you do make is fairly quick - not a long mechanical process.  The THEME is great, especially for anyone immersed in the books/tv show.  The rules are fairly simple, except ports are a little convoluted.  Combat as is makes for a relatively predictable outcome with few direct casualties - but the optional cards (included) make combat more unpredictable and deadly.

This game is amazing. It has only one draw back. Its complexity. If you have the time and patience to learn and teach this game to others it will be one of the best strategy experiences of your life. You dont even have to be a GoT fan to play the game. Although if you are not into the stategy genre i would not recommend this game as it involves really hard tacticts which might tire those not into the strategy mood. On the other hand its must play if you are into strategy.

Great game. Really. We love the hidden instructions and character-card mix up, and the game is always intense, dirty, and full of deals and betrayals.
only reason it is not a 9.5 is that the board is very specifically balanced player-wise: it is not just best with 5, it is far less interesting with 4 or 6, unless you have the relevant expansions.

There is no game I anticipate playing more, and there is no game as frustrating. I love so much about this game - the tactics, the negotiation, and the smack talk. Unfortunately it is offset by two problems that loom too large  - game duration, and that someone is going to get ganged up on, and must just suck up a rough (long) evening to give others a good night. Gave this away when I moved country.

RATING: 7
Although there are many concepts in terms of actions, attack, defence and possibly cooperation that Diplomacy has, it doesn't come anything near it. The game doesn't support alliances since you cannot negotiate and discuss in secret (you can, but that is not the intention of the game). I didn't like the cards influencing random actions, which makes a lot depend on luck again.

Having some of the original expansion stuff included in the second edition makes it an automatic improvement over first edition, but the gameplay experience doesn't change that much, so the first edition comment remains, being:
The pace feels about right for what it was. I was thinking all the way through, hmmm:
- movement, units and support rules from Diplomacy
- add resources to supply centres a la Borderlands (& Mare Nostrum & Wallenstein)
- steal the pre-ordering of defined functions from Wallenstein (& crowns=wheat)
- pinch the combat cards from LotR: Confrontation

et voila, some pretty good heritage.

I was expecting more real alliance Diplomacy however, but really it's like any other multi-player wargame where you agree shared boundaries, and pick your time for breaking them to shoot for the win. We don't see real joint alliance play where two players combine to wipe someone out, then move on to the next objective. Maybe that's just our group think though. Too nicey nice.

But if you want to play a bash up the leader multi-player wargame, this played easily and enjoyably. But the experience for me wasn't much different from Mare Nostrum or any of the others. Because it's multi-player bashup, it'd probably be an improvement if the game ended randomly, with increasing chances each turn, to encourage everyone to go for it each turn without the waiting, waiting, waiting that the game can produce, where there's little change in state for an hour or so in the middle-game.

An amazingly good game which brought me to BoardGameGeek so that I could play on the forums. It's a great combination of strategy and diplomacy, which brings lots of respect to a theme that I personally love so much.
Since orders are placed simultaneously, there is a lot going on in Diplomacy style backstabbing. However, I think the other mechanics of the game moderate that, so if Diplomacy ruined all your friendships - this will be (only slightly moderated). The game board and pieces are beautiful and well done.
IRL it takes a bit longer than you would think and teaching new players take some time. It's a steep curve which requires commitments. And the rules can be at times overly complicated - could have made it a bit simpler at times.

The main mechanic is that you place orders on each area for which you have troops and then use those troops to either move (and possibly battle), support others, gain influence tokens or defend. But there is so much that goes with that. The play is asymmetric so each house has its own strengths and weaknesses due to their location and battle cards as well as their starting influence on the three influence tracks. Each game is unique and the interaction between players is significant. This is a must try regardless of whether you like the books/show.

A really enjoyable mix of King Maker and Diplomacy. Taking the best of both games, the fun of having named leaders and a narrative behind the events requiring diplomacy and strategy on every turn and nearly every action.

Pluses:
Lots of player interaction and scheming, combat and action selection.

Negatives: Some potential balance issues with less than full player counts, length. This would be an 8+ if it didn't take 5 hours.

RATING: 7
Start of my boardgame obsession so It will have a spot in my heart, but otherwise: This game is tricky, it takes ages. and many times nothing will really happen as a back and forth of two of the same territorys between players. 

IF I have a lot of GoT fans at my table who can speak english ( as I have the english version) I will bust it out cause its gorgeous and a total sight for fans. And I would recommend always playing with the tides of Battle cards. 

The slightly random chance of luck will make the game snappier and not let it come down to math alone. (But still not as ridiculously as a dice roll in other war games sometimes is) 

Edit: More thoughts on it the game could def. profit from roleplaying your faction a bit. hold grudges. make alliances. take breaks to make backroom deals. though you would need a committed group, who is into the theme and not afraid to nerd it out of the park.

General Rating 6, for Fans an 8 as it does capture much of the intrigue and world of GoT.

Probably my favourite game, but only with 6 players (though you can player lower player counts with the Feast for Crows expansion). It's Dipomacy meets eurogaming done right.

This game has the simulaneous orders aspect of Diplomacy that I love, without all the pain of written and incorrect orders.

It has bidding.

It has combat, also diplomacy-style with support, convoys and all that.

It has bluffing, hand management, resource managment.

It has high levels of interaction.

Asymmetric powers.

Great components, gorgeous board.

Does everybody like it though? Nope. You better have a thick skin. A weak player can unintentionally throw the game to their neighbour. It can take a while, I've always finished in a normal game night, but I've heard of 8phour games that don't complete??? The games I've played there hasn't been a lot of diplomacy going on, maybe why it finishes in reasonable time.

Almost needs 5-6 players to play correctly. A lot to keep track of and alliances can be broken but you'll probably get your ass handed to you from 3 people instead of 2 if you don't keep it.

Would easily play it again and the only reason it's not rated higher is the difficulty of getting 5-6 willing people to play a game that last 3-5 hours. Time could easily be brought down to 3 hours or so if people are familiar with the game though. Really want to play a couple of the different houses though since I feel like each would play differently.

Edit: Brought the score down. It's not that I don't like the game, but I don't know how much I can play of it. There is nothing particularly wrong with the game, but I feel like I can't be as aggressive without hurting feelings. That and it's already starting to feel "samey".

Edit2: Dropping it down another point. Every single time we've played this game, someone is mad or upset at the end. Overall it's not a bad game, it's just too long for what it is. Not worth the headache this causes each time it's brought to the table.

RATING: 7.5
I like how well this game flows, especially for a six-player title. Rulebook is rather long, but after a game or two everything just clicks and one gets to appreciate the elegant design. AGOT is very conflict driven as neighboring players connect their borders very early from the start.

Components are very nice, but I'd prefer wooden units instead of faux-marble plastic ones. 

Deterministic battles take some thrill from the combat because most of the time the outcome is known the moment a region is attacked. It is easy to follow which nobles the opposing player has left and account for this.

Unfortunately, if players are not very competitive and avoid conflict, game will be bland and boring. Plotting, shifting alliances and table talk are at heart of this title.

Bardzo dobra gra, wymagająca dużo planowania, wybierania elastycznej strategii pozwalającej zaadaptować się do potencjalniej zdrady.
Zasady można byłoby minimalnie uprościć, jest kilka przypadków w stylu jeżeli, to i to, to tam, a zatem coś jeszcze innego.
Dla osób znających grę polecałbym przyjrzeniu się dla 4 i 5 osób wariantowi gry gdzie zastępuje się ród Greyjoy'ów odpowiednio Tyrelami lub Martelami.

Dla mnie Gra o Tron jest to zabawa w planowanie, zdobywanie twierdz i spiskowanie. Niech nikt nie zrozumie mnie źle, gra jest świetna, natomiast ja nie czuję klimatu książki/serialu.


Gra moim zdaniem z książki czerpie nazwę, mapę, karty rodów i ataki dzikich i nic więcej. Niby to dużo ale wszystko można zastąpić czymś innym. Zaopatrzenie, kontrola twierdz, czy tory władzy to elementy które mogą być wykrozystane w dowolnej grze strategicznej. Wszystko co jest czerpane z ksiązki jest zastępowalne dowolnym innym motywem i mamy nie Grę o Tron, tylko czystą strategię. 

Nazwa gry jest niewątpliwie zaletą bo wiele osób z czystej ciekawości chce zagrać, a partyjki w grę o tron nie zwykłem odmawiać.

Fun game that captures the "essence" of Martin's world of Westeros. Though I could only find two more players, it was the first time for all of us and we had a real good time.

For a game with such deep roots in its theme, I was hoping for more here. But in the two games I've played, the explanations run long. Strategies don't present themselves, and I'm no having fun. The last point is the salient thing: I don't play games to have not-fun. If they produce great billowing shafts of not-fun as they come spilling off the back of the un-fun truck, dammit, it ain't a game I mean to stick with. 

Maybe I need more plays, but I'm just not sold on this one yet.

12/16/12 - I wanted this game for such a long time but when I got it, it didn't live up to my expectations. It's a good game but it's not a great game. I'm sure my opinion will change after a few more plays but for now it's just an OK game. The art and components are awesome. The cards are really cool but I guess this game isn't my thing. It will stay in my collection because it fills an Area Control void that I have.

I think I'm more fascinated with this games potential as I have not been able to play it in it's full glory with 6 players all fully invested. It is everything I want an area control game to be. You aren't just pushing around a mass of tiny plastic men around a map. You have to manage supplies for your armies, it has diplomacy, alliances, backstabbing of said alliances and so much more. I am a big fan of the IP however, I don't really feel that it affects this game. You could strip away the Game of Thrones theme and slap on any medieval or fantasy theme and I'd love this game all the same. I really hope Fantasy Flight puts out a 3rd edition to this game.

I enjoy this game a lot.  I found it to be an improvement on the board game "Risk" because it uses more strategy in the gameplay instead of the chance of dice when in a battle.  The different houses and the leaders add an interesting element to each battle, and using tokens to plan ahead all of your next actions make for a complex, strategic and quality game.

I will only play this with the Feast for Crows. It speeds up the game. Can only be played with four.

I don't think I'd play the standard game again but if you do, in lower player counts, watch out for one player taking the south.

Kemet is a good short alternative.

Rex/Dune is a similar with joint victory (which I like)

Play Diplomacy if you want to plan and scheme.

RATING: 10
Love from the first read of manual / first play. Also my first game after 20yrs period w/o board games. Good quality and easy yet cool mechanics of the game. The only drawback is length of time and need of at least 4 people to play (cant's imagine this game with 3 players); 5 player game is HUGE improvement over 4 player one, 6 player game is even better.

edited: after 4th play I can't imagine this game with less than 5 players - in this case use 5 player map based on 1st edition with modifications (Sunset Sea and West Summer Sea border is near Searoad Marches, additional crown is placed in Oldtown)

edited: 4th player south variant seems to be quite balanced. However it lacks multiple relations among players. It's ok, but lacking time I would rather wait and gather 5 people for better experience.

One thing - not sure about random mustering / supply, it works in game somehow however I don't really like it (no simple logic behind it). Second thing - something has to be done to give Lannister a chance in early Greyjoy conflict.

edited: found excellent setups for 4 (no GJ and MA) and 5 player game (no GJ), now it shines even in smaller group! I have AFFC expansion, but played it only once and don't think about buying ADWD expansion.

The rulebook requires you read through it in entirety before playing a game. We just wanted to play the game, so decided to read it as we went along - as we do with most boardgames. A lot of what was written in the rulebook was fairly badly worded (or could have been done a lot simpler), and even after reading I'm not entirely sure of the point of ports. 

The rulebook wasn't very obviously laid out either, meaning many references to the index were required. 

Having read and condensed the rules, we are going to try and play it again later, but as we only have three players (at the moment), it might not be as fun as with more. I can certainly see a lot of room for discussion and planning with other players.

RATING: 6
The second edition brings with it lots of subtle re-balancing, which helps the game immensely. It's a tight 'dudes on a map' game where your opponents are at your borders looking for signs of weakness. Expand too far, and your home becomes vulnerable, but don't expand at all, and risk not making any progress. It's a game where you absolutely need to ally with one neighbor and fight the other, but keep your eyes open always for signs of treachery.

For the second edition they removed these castle pieces that protected strongholds from horses, but they kept in catapults that are special units used to attack only strongholds. I thought that was a strange choice. I'm also never sure how I feel about Tides of War cards which add a random element to an otherwise calculated combat system.

A lot of new, more compelling 'dudes on the map' games have come out in the last few years. Although thinking about this game makes me sentimental, ultimately this game always winds up a turtling contest until the last turn when everyone makes their move. Sure, there's usually a little jockeying back and forth for a spot here or there, but the map creates natural defensible borders, and if players start conflicts too early, they always see their neighbor on the other side move in. I suppose that's thematic, but the game is too long an experience for something that really boils down to 2 important turns right at the end.

I love the limited resource combat style of this game, which requires the same sort of alliances and deals as Diplomacy.  Along with that, the orders mechanic is such a great hidden information game that's going on there.  I love that you try to do as much as possible within the confines of the track you're on.

The tracks themselves are very interesting as well and add lots of theme and some fun stuff to use those influence tokens you acquire on.

This version of the game significantly improved the Westeros deck, which was my big complaint from the first edition.  I love the added flexibility that it gives to the leader on a given track and the allowance that you have more opportunities to get the phases you need.

RATING: 9
A Game of Thrones: The Board Game is a great game, and one of my favorites for larger groups. My gaming group always enjoys playing and I rarely have trouble finding six people willing to play, although it is also quite fun with less than six players. The game does a decent job of making it fair with any amount of players, but certain areas can be exploited more easily when you have less than five or six.  There is very little luck involved in the game, which I enjoy. Combat is done through the power of the pieces involved on the board, move orders placed by players at the beginning of each turn and combat cards which you choose during combat and reveal simultaneously. Combat being done this way is a lot more exciting than just rolling dice or having some other random determinate. There are many different strategies involving the different houses (factions) and working together or against other players to take over the most castles. 

The only problem with the six player game from my perspective is slight inequality in the different houses starting set ups. While I've seen every individual house win at some point in my play throughs, The Baratheons have a very powerful and open starting location while some houses like the Greyjoys and the Lannisters have far less room to expand before they will have to pick fights with other players. 

Overall though, it is a very entertaining game with great replay value and I recommend it for anyone who enjoys military based strategy games.

Beigazolódtak a félelmeim, sajnos. Ki lehet esni a játékból illetve a kezdő házak helyzete is döntő lehet. Bár ezt szerintem kellő diplomáciával lehet kezelni. Szóval van benne kraft, de mégis rossz nézni az asszisztálok arckifejezését. Mondom ezt az után, hogy nyertem a 9. körben.
Maga a rendszer tetszett, vannak eredeti ötletek is, valójában én inkább erőforrás menedzselésnek találtam, kis konfliktusokkal. Gyerek "wargame". A diplomáciát erősebben kellett volna beleszőni a mi játékunkban. Szóval nem rossz, de kedvenc nem lesz.

Now this game has serious design flaws. It's carried by theme alone - you will play it twice and realize something's wrong, you will probably think it's balancing issues and never touch it again but have fond memories of the first 2 plays. This game is definitely not worth its price, it's just a mess of barely connected mechanics. The game doesn't know if it wants to be Diplomacy's stream-lined modern successor or a quick random strategy game for fun so it ends up being very disappointing and pointless. You will have fun on your first play when you get to play as Starks and make alliances and backstabs and plans but you will quickly notice this should be more enjoyable. As soon as you start thinking about the game and what other players are doing the spell is gone and whatever fun you had impersonating characters is gone. If you want a game that's only held together by theme go play cops and robbers outside!

NOTE: This game is likely going to get an update to a '10'. I want to play the four player variant before I make my decision on this score. I've played this game three times now and every single time I walk away entirely pleased with the experience, reviewing what went right and wrong in my head, and how to do a better job next time. And, most importantly, wanting to play again as soon as possible.

My love of this game has almost nothing to do with the theme and almost everything to do with the mechanics. Diplomatic interactions, asymmetric powers, hidden orders, secret bidding, random events, and a touch of cooperative (but not too much!). There are so many great mechanics going on this game and they work so well together. The phases of game play are rich and diverse layers. You don't have to be a fan of the books (or the TV series) to appreciate this game. This game could have been set in any age or realm and still worked well.

I love this game, but it's a harder one to get to the table due to the length.

Despite the wall of rules-text, the bulk of gameplay is easy to understand and feels mostly intuitive once in motion.  

The big downside here is that it takes a large chunk of time for each round to resolve, making even the most minor of border squabbles take a good 30-60min depending on the politics of the table.
But worry not! It's likely that you'll be too engrossed in the game to notice the clock ticking away.

Its a more accessible version of Diplomacy and its awesome.  The war stuff is great, but I really like the little add on ideas like the Wildling threat and the three bidding tracks for power.  Love the books and I love that they made a great game for them.

Excellent game in the right conditions. These conditions are with the full complement of 6 players* and ideally with all 6 players having an idea of what they are doing. In this circumstance this game can provide a fantastic experience.

On the standard 4-5 player set-ups: I don't expect perfect balance in this type of game as minor imbalances help to push the negotiation elements, but the standard 4/5 player variants are too far from this ideal, IMO, though the 5 is better than the 4.

There are some non-official variants, though, that I'd like to try.

RATING: 9
I love the secret orders and deterministic combat. You definitely need something of a poker face, you can outmaneuver your opponents just by looking at what part of the board they are looking at. The game length is long, but never feels boring. The theme is excellently integrated and we love to make quotes from the show like "a Lannister always pays his debts". The components are of excellent quality.

My only criticism is some of the rules are "picky" and hard to nail down until you've played two or three times. things like siege engines can't retreat, you can march out of a port but not into one, and you can't consolidate power in a sea area.

Play as one of your favorites houses in Westeros as you wage all out war. Alliances can be formed as quickly as they fall, don't believe a thing your opponents say, as there can only be one sitting on The Iron Throne. One of the through and through war games that I really enjoy. It's very deep in strategy and politics. It takes a lot of time to play it; and the main reason why I can't find a play group to play it with regularly. One thing is for sure, I will always be down to play this game when the opportunity presents itself.

I love the mechanics in the game, I love the simulation of Westeros politics, war and backstabbing and I love how you are never truly sure of who's going to win, since a very clever turn from a player can rocket him to first place. The game is not perfect though, is difficult to get it to the table because of the lenght, also because it is best played with six, and because it has so many rules, that is difficult to play with new players. Despite all of this I've never had a boring or uninteresting game session and I'm always looking forward to play it again.

*Spoiler Alert* They all die in the end!!!! MWUAHAHA. Seriously though this game is a great change of pace from some of the traditional models. Playing this game requires a lot of strategizing and thinking on your toes. Also remembering what each token does is helpful, but with the handy dandy little player screens with all the info on them, its easy to just take a quick glance to remember. Unless of course you are half blind and only wear pharmacy bought reading glasses that aren't your proper prescription.

I love and hate this game at the same time.  There are some great ideas here, but the randomless combat kills me. Well, actually it's not that exactly that bothers me so much.  The battles are anticlimatical even though they are the centre of the game.  This game would be a lot better with the cube tower from Shogun.

A game that gets better each time I play. It takes a few plays to find a house that fits your strategy, but I've had fun testing out all the different options available.

This is a more confrontational game than I usually go for, but combat is handled well and I love the negotiation and politics that go on behind the scenes. This is really a game about opportunity. Make alliances while you can, but don't hold hard feelings if someone has to break an agreement to grab the win. After all, there's only room on the throne for one!

Superb multiplayer military/diplomatic game based on the fantastic book series. Derived from the original diplomacy, it adds great mechanisms to control builds and expansion. The cards add a welcome random element to combat. Players go head to head very quickly after a turn of expansion.
This edition took the best of the first game and expansions (I do miss leaders) and created a definitive edition.

I know people love this game, but I don't.  I strongly suspect that if no one had ever heard of George Martin this game would be in the bargin bin at Wallmart instead of the top of the BGG ratings.  It's fundamental mechanics are borrowed from Diplomacy and so it has all the same flaws.

Thoroughly enjoy the depth of strategy and politics in this fairly easy to learn, difficult to master board game.

Playing with house rules that do this make for a much more interesting game.

Not entirely sure the length of the 6p is worth the time invested. Rex is superior for the same kind of free-for-all fighting mechanics and luckless battle system. There is a much deeper strategy / tactical element with movement, but is it worth 45-60 min/player? Nope.

Am a big fan of the Game of Thrones series and hence that could have made me more bias towards the game but it was a blast in most of the times I played. Tough playing the Lannisters so it's not balanced for all factions but good medium weight strategy and wargame fun.

An outstanding board game with elegant design and rules that requires deep thinking. Its complexity is one of the reasons why I love it so much. It can be frustrating to learn for new players. Still, I wouldn't hesitate teaching and miss playing this game. With some good friends, this game becomes amazingly fun.

I have never played a full 6-player game, but I did play from 3 to 4 which have been tons of fun. When you play such games, you have to set a rule for alliances to prevent players from teaming up on just one player. This is especially true in 3-player games. Also, you have to make some areas impassable to make certain houses come and fight everyone.

Edit: After 10+ games, it is still engaging and fun. I can't wait to get my hands on the Feast for Crows expansion though.

(08/13/2014) - Having found myself hopelessly addicted to the book series and television adaptation, I bought this game in hopes of playing it sometime during the wedding weekend. Sadly there never was enough time for this to come together. I am hopeful that at some point it will hit the table though!

(08/13/2015) - [8.5] - Despite really needing a full set of six for maximum enjoyment, I find this game quite enjoyable. It strikes me as a sort of Diplomacy variant, with less dryness in the rules and more tactical variety. Four players with some BGG variants salvage this for smaller groups.

Clever and enjoyable mechanics everywhere, excellent production. Truly an amazing way to pit strategic, ruthless friends against each other in a thoroughly tense game.

Objective flaw: Takes too long (about 1h per player, with a floor of 3h, in my experience). Unless you've got dedicated friends, it will be hard to get going.

Subjective flaw: Due to the length, players get invested. And some people cannot handle the backstabbing. Can sour a night, even cause friendship tension.

RATING: 6
I love the show, so was obviously interested to have a try of the board game having heard a few good reviews.

It does have some good mechanics. Area control and resource management are key concepts. As everyone has borders with other players, it is very important to maintain good relations with your immediate neighbours early. But the very nature of this game is deceit, and you will have to attack sooner, rather than later. It's just a case of who betrays first...

Overall, it's pretty decent and I'm not adverse to commiting the time to play. Does need a decent group of players to play, though. If you get the case of someone "just making up the numbers", they make it very easy on their neighbours. This does unbalance things considerably.

Definitely worth trying out!

(+) Beautiful artwork and top notch game components!
(+) This game truly feels epic, It feels like every decision you make is important to the future of Westeros :)
(+) They managed to capture the feel of the books and TV-series with a game which cleverly stimulates intrige and conflict
(+) The system with hidden orders, area control and card management makes for a very interesting boardgame, filled with interesting decisions

(-) Very unbalanced opening positions on the game board and family house card-powers (I feel Lanister really has a rough time, yet I have never played with them), but I can see this built in inbalance stimulates player-interaction, conflict and a general dynamic which stimulates players to negotiate which is of course brilliant
(-) Some luck dependence with the Westeros cards. They can seriously mess your plans up. If you can't handle such a thing, this game might not be for you.
(-) It takes a long time and big dedication to explain the game to others, mainly due to some exeptions (ports, ships, special rules regarding support and raid used on ports or sea areas, ...)

A really solid game, but can feel a bit bloated and overwhelming at times. The biggest issue is that there is a very limited window to when this game can be played.

- game length too long for what it does
- how it doesn't play as well with four players

Great mixture of diplomacy, tactics, and resource management.  I like that the diplomacy is important, but you don't have to depend too much on trust, as your supposed ally cannot just roll over you that easily by a backstab. I would probably rate it a 10 if it didn't take 4+ hours to play.

Update: With the 4p Feast of Crows expansion, which shortens it to under 2 hours, it's a 10.

I had my reservations prior to buying this game after hearing about people's opinions on how the game is unbalanced. Have to say that personally I do not think this is true. While yes, you do have to play towards your strengths as a house, by no means is one house more in favor of winning than the others. 

The only draw back is that you need six people to get the full experience. If you don't, the game becomes about a 8 or 9 just because the way the houses are placed and the weakness of neutral territories. But overall this game is KILLER. If you do not like confrontation to not get this game. But if you like making deals then stabbing your opponent in the back through bidding and subterfuge there is not one I have play that has been better. For all the people whining about this aspect of the game don't play it and go buy a Euro city building game or something.

Interesting game with a lovely game mechanic. I love the hard choices during planning and combat and the epic feeling of the game. Down sides are that the game is a little long for the amount of fun it provides and a bit unbalanced with less than 6 people. Hard to find 6 persons that want to invest around 5 hours in a board game.

A very tightly designed and impressive game where it's hard to get ahead or make any progress. Even when you're doing well you feel depressed and constrained, by supply, plastic, etc. Like a knife-fight in a phone booth. We have trouble ever managing to finish a game within 5 hours.

I've tried playing this at 3 and 4 players. It was horribly unbalanced. Despite having a sold ruleset and game mechanics, the fact that it felt like a necessity to have 6 players makes me rate this game much lower than it should have gotten.

I've not played Diplomacy, but I understand this to be a sort of reimplementation of that game, with simultaneously revealed hidden orders in an area control war game.  The atmosphere of Game of Thrones is captured decently well.  I have not played enough to comment with much authority on the balance, but I did feel that certain factions seem stunted and may feel "locked down" if they are unable to expand early.  The game has a good combination of different mechanics, which make it fairly interesting and complex.  I found that it risks dragging on, but could probably be played in a decent amount of time with experience, which would make it more of a contender in the area control category, for me.

Game of complete interaction between players.  Negotiation and politics all way long.  Zero luck.  And if you like Game of Thrones, you will simply love the way you can "re-write" the story.  Players play against each other, but also cooperatively against the wildlings.   Simply excellent.

Best played with those who have about as much experience with the game as yourself - otherwise the most optimal moves, turn by turn, are too obvious to those with a greater number of games under their belts. Due to the lack of chance. Boring both for newbies and old greybeards alike, if so.

The map's not as nice or easy one the eyes. And the old raven's a bit cuter too. The wood components probably preferable to the plastic. 

The rulebook is clear (altho' ports seem tricky)!

In some ways it is strongly themed, in others not so much, as the designers went the route of making the powers pretty symmetrical, apart from their obvious geographic differences and the special powers in the House cards. A game like Sword of Rome took a different route, making the powers more distinct. Which is better from the "realities" of the books, I don't know.

My first play was with five and it worked well, although I suspect Tyrell may have had a bit easier without an active Martell around. Should shine with six as a pretty brilliant, interactive game. I came in second with Stark, coming from behind after finally scraping together just enough resources.  

Long game, though.

Second edition fixes some flaws in the first edition and introduces some elements of the original first expansion, but is not without problems either. The ports are here, all right, as well as house Martell. The siege engines also made it, but curiously not the fortifications, so it's now much easier to storm a castle than to defend it, which is non-thematic, unfortunate and detracts from strategy in the game. New house cards are again unbalanced, with some (Balon Greyjoy) being definitely too powerful. Overall, a very good game which could easily be almost perfect if not for (I presume) hasty publishing process of FFG.

The one flaw is that, without randomizer in the form of Tides of Battles cards (which increase or reduce your battle strength randomly), my games never end prematurely - conquering 7 castles is next to impossible with competent opposition.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
 This is a very involving game, absolutely minimal down time, and from the second turn the tree of possible moves and interactions pretty much explodes, so that it seems unlikely that any two games will be the same, and players must keep their wits about them. The mechanics seem appropriate to the theme, even though the euro-ish nature of many mechanics (the various checks and balances, and of course luckless combat) will not appeal to everybody - they should appeal to plenty, though, and for my taste really make the game, as its fascinating how uncertain things can be in spite of the lack of dice. This is by no means a unique feature to this game, but here (as compared say to War of the Roses Lancaster vs York) it somehow manages to achieve the Ameritrash feel. 

I own but have not yet played 1st edition, so can't really comment on the play differences in editions, but would say that graphically the components of this edition are much more pleasing, and though I would prefer them in wood, the plastics pawns are nice enough.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like the clearer map and the whole shebang in the one box. The rulebook is easier to find what one needs to find than in the first edition. I greatly prefer the wooden pieces of the first edition to the new cheap feeling plastic pieces. A bit sad that the one use tiles didn't make it into this version, but there's more than just the basics in the one box and if that's all the shelf room you've got to invest in A Game of Thrones then this is the edition to get. It's a mix of the original and the best tweaks from the first edition expansions.

Five rules to remember:
1. Special Consolidate Power Order Token can be used to initiate mustering in its area.
2. Only one combat is allowed per march order.
3. The Messenger Raven token allows the holder to also look at the top card of the Wildling deck and place the card at the bottom of the deck if she chooses.
4. Ports with a friendly unit receive a power token (when the GoT Westeros card is resolved), as long as the adjacent sea is not occupied with enemy ships (i.e. blockaded).
5. When you raid a Consolidate Power order not only do you receive a power token, but the player losing the Consolidate Power order has to give up one of their power tokens.

The game runs a little long for my taste. You could probably get most of the experience in six turns. After a few turns the game seems to become a waiting game anyway - position yourself for the final push, then go for it. A few ideas have been suggested to speed things along - something like rolling a die at the beginning of each turn after turn five and on a 4-6 the game will end at the end of that turn. I'd like to try it because I'm going to like the game more if it's a two hour experience and not a four hour, ten turn experience. On the other hand it might reduce the likelihood of a player getting a seven castle win and the kind of swings you can get in the game that make it kind of fun.

Alliances seem to be tricky to form in our group. Apparently the temptation for small raiding gains is not conducive to multi-turn mutual support for mutual beneficial position. Sure, ultimately there's the inevitable and predictable betrayal, but usually in alliance games you'd better make it count when you do decide to backstab. With our constant backstabbing and resulting trust issues the furthest we ever seem to get is... well, not very far. Death by a thousand cuts really.

Despite only 4 plays, I think I can rate this - love it so far! Just wish we could play it more often. The "Support" tokens are really the key.

Have played both the base game and the FFC expansion - FFC is good for bringing the game down to a manageable timeline, though I wish the Arryn player had proper pieces to play with. Still haven't gotten a 6 player base game in yet, but would love to do that at some point in 2018! Also haven't gotten a chance to play DWD yet.

Main thoughts are already posted with the old edition. As for this one, art is gorgeous, especially on the cards, but can get too busy and bordering on hard-to-see on the board (red borders for sea regions? wtf?). Marbled plastic minis, instead of wood, add to the busy-ness. [-]Tides of Battle is an utter fail; I get that it's the successor to the Clash of Kings variant, but it could have been less swing-y.[/-] I appreciate that the best parts of the expansions are here (e.g. Ports, Westeros Cards that give benefits to title-holders). Not sure I like Siege Engines though, especially since there are no Forts.

6er is where it's at (though Martell and Lannister seem squeezed). 4-5 are not playable out of the box and need house-rules because the neutral tokens can't stand against siege engines. 3er is okay, just takes a while to get the battles going, and there's little diplomacy, just straight-up outguessing.

A little shocking that the designers actually thought 4- and 5-player were balanced after including siege engines (just because the players balance the game doesn't mean you get to throw out a woefully unbalanced thing to start with), especially since they got it mostly right in 1ed. But no big deal, use my simple fixes.

[u]selwyth's ultimate game-balancers[/u]
6er: 14 non-capital cities for 6 players, 2.3/player.
5er: Set it up as usual, but then flip Sunspear and Yronwood over to make them impassable. 13 castles for 5, 2.6/player. Starfall/Storm's End is okay due to Tyrell vs. Baratheon. Or alternatively, flip them all over except Sunspear.
4er: Additionally, make Highgarden, Oldtown, Storm's End and Starfall impassable (the 3er board). 10 for 4, 2.5/player.
3er: Play something else. If you really must, make Supply or Power the first tiebreaker instead to curb Lannister's stronghold advantage.

[hr]
Lowered design rating. Shocking imbalance with 4-5er. Lannister-Greyjoy is too swing-y. And all-round lack of thematic integration (circa early 2000s FFG) that fails to capitalize on the awesome theme; it's disappointing they didn't re-design from the ground up, or re-skin a design with more treachery and intrigue, like DUNE. This is the biggest letdown for me. Also, the rich gets richer in this game (and it's very hard to prop up the weaklings), and it sucks to be caught in no-man's-land without any chance at victory (and you can sometimes identify this pretty early).

Also, this is poster child for 'unnecessarily 6-player'. There are 2 players you're neighbors with, and the others can be virtually invisible to you, with opportunities for cooperation coming up rarely, resulting in unnecessary downtime. 4-player works much better, as seen in A Storm of Swords and A Feast for Crows expansions.

Also, one cannot anoint this as a 'negotiation game' or emblematic of the intrigue in the source material when [i]you can't even trade your power tokens[/i]! Seriously considering that as a house rule.

As long as you're using the base game and rules, there's basically no luck involved with regard to combat or any decisions that you make. This game is Diplomacy with a more thematic and militaristic bent.

First game just confirmed to me, I need to play the second and third game of this as well. And probably fourth. 

Coming in, I expected something similar to Diplomacy and it isn't, well some bits are, but mostly not. What is similar to Diplomacy is that it's asymmetrical and you need a couple of plays to know who to attack and what your options are. What it's not is that the negotiation could be more enforced and the tokens laying isn't that unpredictable. Still, for a behemoth range game from FFG it does leave an impression that most of the game is left to the players (not the rules), so I'm optimistic about it. Also prone to groupthink, so necessary to play a couple of times with the same group. 

From what I read, I would probably more enjoy the first edition with its expansions. (rules wise). I was surprised however that the board of the 2nd ed. actually looks nice, and not as morbid as it seems on the photos.

Many improvements on the original. Most important is the new Westeros cards that allow the token holders to effectively pick from amongst several cards... most significantly supply and muster...

The ports also make a huge difference, preventing a player from being land-locked. This seems to cause games to go longer as players are *much* harder to eliminate. On the plus side, people generally don't get kicked out early!

This game can go off-the-rails a bit when people are drinking and playing this game. The first couple turns are fast because nobody is clashing and everyone is sober, but turns 7-10 (if it makes it that far) can sometimes take 30 minutes to an hour each once everyone has had a few drinks.

Yes I love Game of Thrones EVERYTHING! But I just, like this game mainly because without the full compliment of players (and even then I wouldn't know because I've only played with 3 and 4) it's not much of a game. At 3 the Baratheons are unstoppable, barring some really f*cked up stuff happening to them in the Westeros phase. With 4 the way the map to the south opens it forces everyone into the role of whom they need to oppose and align with. The mechanics of the game itself are solid and the theme comes through fairly well, Though I think the Raven is a more powerful token than the Iron Throne which doesn't seem quite right. Even still good game, just wish I could find a few more people to play it with for the full experience.

RATING: 10
Is 2nd e. better than the 1st? Yes. It takes virtually all the good stuff from the 1st editions expansions and incorporates them in the base game (sans the fortifications, which I quite liked). The crap which changed the game for the worse (mostly Storm of Swords stuff) is blissfully left out. 

To my eyes the map looks better now, but it's maybe a little restless to look at. The plastic pieces do a pretty good job although I usually prefer wood. Otherwise it's still the same awesome game with a few minor tweaks making it nigh on perfect for me.

Too long for what it is.
Played two times, both won. All the game was decided on last turn, all the previous game flow was almost irrelevant to endgame result.
But it was mildly fun (theme helps a lot), I would play it again if I'll find this amount of time (but I'd prefer to play something more agile, like Eclipse or two games of Imperial or five games of Nexus Ops)

Great strategy land conquering game. Takes a long time to play, so this would be the main game of a game night, each players planning phase can take a long time depending on if they know how to play. It is a lot more fun with the max of 6 players, with less players you have limited access to the board and some players can be overpowered by board position, leaving some stuck or eliminated early.

The game would get a MUCH higher rating from me if I would be into area control. Probably a nine. It is much more interesting and gripping than most other games of this genre I played. We played for 4 hours and it sure didn't feel like it. Has a lot of in-game text, so your english should be good if you want to enjoy it. (Or you get a version in your language rather). Also it does not really matter if you aren't into Game of Thrones at all.

RATING: 7
[i]Overrated, flawed, and outclassed -- but kinda good anyway.[/i]

solid game, kept from greatness by some problems:

1) Big crowded map full of players you will never be able to reach. Seriously. Optimistically, you will have 6 players for this -- half of them will be increasing your game length by 2-3 hours, and you can't really interact with them.

2) Rich get richer element -- because of the crowded map, for some players to be moving ahead towards the victory condition, others have to be putting permanently behind. (with limited ways to impact the winners (most often they just kingmake). The spots that push you towards victory ALSO contain resources and mustering points. *However, I now think this can be mitigated SLIGHTLY with great players, as they will not only not allow someone to get too far ahead, but also not allow their neighbors to get too far behind.

3) Kingmaking -- this game is all about manuevering into position where you are one of the contenders for a win on the last turn, since with good players no one is winning early. Whether you win or not on the last turn just depends on you making zero mistakes and hoping the rest of the battles between the kingmakers and your competition go your way-- it's largely out of your hands. Yes, all your hard work comes down to this!

4) Combat and it's effect on the game -- the combat system, in a vacuum, is OK -- deterministic, yet it _sometimes_ rewards mind games. If they know you have a guaranteed win in your hand, maybe you don't play it because they're going to sandbag? But then what if they know you want to save your best card? Etc. It's usually just a mixup between 2 options or so, and it works OK. But the deterministic combat has an effect on the game -- people usually won't attack the other player unless they know they can win, or if the battle is worth it to them for some other reason. This isn't inherently a problem, but leads to turtley game and predictability. That leads me to the next thing...

5) (Optional) Tide of Battle Cards -- These cards make the deterministic combat not really deterministic. When I heard the concept, I thought maybe they'd help break up the turtley conditions and stalemates caused by deterministic combat where you only attack if you KNOW you win/benefit. Maybe Tide of Battle cards reward risk taking occasionally? Nope. They are not to be counted on, and actually increase the amount of unit death in the game, which ruin peoples plans and FURTHER constrain you in a game where unit constraint is already a big deal. And the worst part is that Tides of Battle cards don't seem to actually change the way players play  -- instead, it just randomizes the results they get. Luck in games is fine, even long ones like this, but IMO luck should impact your decisions -- here I don't think it does.

6) Setting -- The game has the Game of Thrones license, set in Westeros, and populated by a couple dozen iconic characters... except not really. As my friend once said after trying this for the first time, "This game could have just as easily been named Soldiers, Knights, & Boats" and it wouldn't be a lesser game for it. The Game of Thrones setting, while fantastic, is basically squandered

7) Negotiation/Backstabbing -- Yes, it exists, kind of? Without hidden info or ways for players to actually exhcnage anything (currency, positions, etc), this seems largely based on just analyzing who's in the lead and making informed decisions. OR taking advantage of naive players who are not good at doing so. Yeah, you'll be "backstabbed" after making a deal, but you KNOW you will because only one player can win (so it's like any other game), and you usually know when, how, and why. IMO. Maybe I'm missing some stuff though here, not sure about this one.

8) Competition/Length -- I love long games.Don't have the problem with the length. But the length on this one, and its player count, puts it in direct competition with Dune, the other long, epic 6 player game about alliances and betrayals. But.... Dune doesn't suffer from ANY of the problems above! Dune opens up its map and interaction, letting you battle and trade with whomever you please. Instead of being held back by dividing players into run-away potential winners and kingmakers (losers), it lets the winners officially ally against the losers to close the game out early and not have to worry about such things. Combat in Dune tends towards deterministic, but mind games are ALWAYS present, so the result is a battle that feels strategic yet unpredictable. Dune makes fantastic use of its setting, and backstabbing is an option rather than a certainty so when you are betrayed it stings all the more!

All of this may make it seem like I hate this game, but I really don't. I've never been completely bored playing it or anything. It just comes so close to something I could fully embrace but falls short which is why I'm hard on it.

A decent game with some nice thematic touches. Unfortunately, it suffers from a lot of the problems common to games like this -- kingmaking, randomness that makes for bad experiences (we played a game in which ALL musters came out before ANY supplies, and ALL Game of Thrones came out before ANY Clash of Kings -- it was awful), and a general overstaying of its welcome. Either someone blunders, or the game bogs down to a repetitive back-and forth after a certain number of turns. A player whose neighbors play poorly has a strong advantage. I would not turn down an offer to play, but I probably would not suggest it, either.

RATING: 9
This could very well become the best and favorite game of your gaming group... but only if two things happen:

1. If you have the full 5-6 players, you're going to have a good game.  If you have 4 or less... it's not fun... in fact, it's pretty boring and virtually impossible to play the main campaign (by "main campaign", I'm thinking about the contrast between the main story and the small-scale scenarios that the first edition expansion sets came with).

2. If no one is broken/defeated after one or two turns.  It can be easy for new players who aren't paying attention to completely wreck the Greyjoys and Lannisters, and essentially make it impossible for one side or the other to win.  That's hugely frustrating for new players, and can turn into a deeply unsatisfying game.

But otherwise, this is a beautiful game.  Not only is it physically beautiful from the board to the cards, but the entire concept of hidden orders that are revealed at the same time offers tons of replay and strategic value.  No dice!  Hidden character cards that can win a battle!  Chaining march orders to make a sneak attack!  Raids that can cancel an opponent's support order, which will then make your main attack succeed!  This is a real strategy game.

The set-up isn't that extensive (okay, the first time or two will take 30-45 minutes to set up and get the rules, but after the first two games, summarizing the rules and setting up for a game can take as little as 10-15 minutes).   I quite like complex games, but you don't have to in order to get this game.

Super fun strategy game.

I'm not an expert on war/diplomacy games but A Game of Trones The Board Game is one of the best games i have ever played. It's long, it's prone to AP and it can be unbalanced if you play with less than 6 players (there are more balanced variants on the forum for 4-5 players though), but it is nonetheless, a fantastic game imo.

The simultaneous action selection and no-dice-combat works like a charm. There is luck involved (random cards in the Westeros phase and Wildling attack), but it adds to the game in a good way. It's tense from the very beginning and the theme is great. I love it.

---------Update-----------

Lowered my rating by 1 down to 8. The game is unbalanced and i pitty the player who gets to play the Lannisters. 

--------Update-----------

Lowered my rating to a 6. Game of Thrones the Board Game is a really neat game. I love the mechanics and the theme. Unfortunately it's unbalanced. You can see it in a players eyes when he gets to play Lannister. There is no way he is going to win unless the other players let him. I love the game but i don't feel like playing again :(

I dinged my rating down 1/10th of a point with this 2nd edition compared to that of the original game.  This is because I think Fantasy Flight swung and missed on the graphic design of this edition.  The muddy, dark brown look is bad.  I understand wanting to get a "heavy" feel to match the books, but it just didn't work.  The text on the game board is also too small.  I'm not sure if you get printer's proofs with some Chinese print shops, but if I was the designer I would be very disappointed with how thin and drab the counters came out.   The game play, itself, is better.  But the graphic design is somewhat of a disappointment.

I finally got a chance to play this game and it's really great! The theme is well done and the strategy is pretty deep. 

There are a few downsides--we played with 4 players and could see early on that the game is really meant for 5-6 players and the game mechanics can be a bit daunting to explain to new players. 

That being said, the mechanics are very intuitive and once you know all the elements gameplay is easy (mastering the game, however, is not. hehee) A very solid and fun game.

A very long and dull game. During my first play after 3 hours we were less than half-way through and everyone wanted to stop because we were bored.

It is also very random with what events come up each round, so you can barely plan ahead at all.

Very good conquest-style game. I like how each of the houses has slightly different abilities. The management of supply is also a clever mechanic that reduces the size of armies and prevents anyone from amassing too much force. In addition, I think that the use of influence tokens to change player order and tiebreakers is pretty cool. Combine that with the limitations on how many starred tokens you can play and simultaneous action selection with putting down your orders, the game actually moves pretty quickly. There are issues with player count with less than the full complement of 6, unfortunately.

When played with a group of friends, this game (albeit long) never fails to provide solid entertainment. Although seemingly complex, the gameplay itself is actually quite straightforward and I've seen gamers of all types grasp the basic mechanics.

I always suggest playing with the tides of chaos though - the level of randomness adds to the fun!

Really beautiful art.  Love the theme and narrative.  If you like GoT and Risk this is absolutely the game for you.  I love the partially cooperative (repelling wildlings) simultaneous with the trying to undermine, trick, coerce each other.  By far the most political risk-style wargame.. the three positions of power also add a great twist to the game.  Strongly recommend for players who can happily play a four or five hour game.

The game itself is excellent... I haven't decided if it's superior to the 1st edition, but it may very well be.  My only complaint is the siege engines -- really can't stand them in play.  Too swingy.  I feel the same way regarding the alternative leaders, but as they're clearly "optional" I've no problem with their inclusion.

The biggest complaint is that the board itself isn't as easily read (though it's certainly beautiful), and the marbled plastic bits aren't nearly as nice as the old wooden ones.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is an alright game but not one that is particularly for me.  It is a combat oriented area control game and it feels very much like a war game but I'm sure war game fans would take issue with that.

The last couple of times I played a war game with any kind of weight were Axis and Allies: 1942 and Risk Legacy and I did not enjoy them at all.  This game shares a lot of the problems I have with those games.  I'm not a fan of static setups for one.  Aside from the amount of time it takes to set up a game there are some balance issues there I think.  It appears that the players in the center of the map are at a disadvantage needing to fight a 2-front war while the Starks and Martells only need to worry about bolstering to their south or north respectively.  This also can cause the game to feel stale if you end up playing the same House multiple times since you always start out the same way and probably need to follow similar strategies.

The combat system is almost identical to Kemet, which I actually like.  In fact, I like this system a little bit better because each House has a deck of combat cards that are unique and many of them have special abilities on them besides the normal combat, casualty, and defense numbers.  I'm a fan of asynchronous player abilities and this works well to differentiate the different Houses, plus if you're a Song of Fire and Ice fan it is neat to be able to see all the different familiar character art.

The art is very good too, in fact the production values of this game are very good.  The pieces are all attractive although they could have been differentiated a little bit more.  Once the board is filled with plastic it can be hard to tell which pieces are footmen, knights, and siege engines at different angles.  The bonus tokens for the influence tracks are gigantic things making them seem to carry a particular weight of importance.  The board is also nice looking and despite the amount of information each area conveys does a good job of not looking cluttered or confusing.  The one other complaint I would levy against the components, and it is minor, is the order tokens should have symbolized which house they belong to on both sides.  In a game with a large number of players and especially with players moving and invading different areas they can get a little mixed up or confusing.

I guess where the game eventually falls for me, and why it is not a keeper, is it doesn't do much to justify the length and trouble it takes to get it played.  Users here on BGG say it is best with 6, which I agree with, and it also takes 3 hours.  I think that's an optimistic estimate with 6 players.  The first time I played with 6, including a rules explanation to be fair, we hit 3 hours at almost the exact halfway mark.  This is a 5-hour game with 6 players, you might be able to trim that to 3.5-4 hours with experienced players but you have to play a few 5 hour games to get players to that point first.  Not to mention getting 6 people together to play a game that long is not an easy task.

And honestly, I just have better (in my opinion) games that fill the same roles.  Kemet is incredibly similar and plays in a 3rd of the time or less and has more variability with the special powers, which is more my style anyway.  Even Small World, also with variable powers, scratches that combat/area control itch.  And if I am going to play a game for 5 hours there are games I would prefer to pull out as well, like Merchant of Venus.  So ultimately I just don't think I would ever reach for this game over others.

The game itself is really good, but the time it takes and the fact that its best enjoyed with 6 people is such a downside. I do have the 4 player variant and is pretty good, but the real meat of the game is with 6 players (both the base scenario and the other one that i cant remember the name haha). Dont know if someone who doesnt follow GoT would have that much fun.

As others have said, no such thing as luck within the game, which is great.

With six players I would rate this much higher. (maybe a 10) The game is incredibly well designed for six but suffers immensely with each player lost.

At first I loved this game. I like GoT, I like strategy, I like scheming. BUT... after few games you realise how every game is basicaly the same, at start everybody run to get as much stuff for free as they can and then for majority of the game you end up fighting for 1-2 zones and near the end you start doing some risky manouvers. To that add time you spend playing it, which is almost the whole day and you start avoiding this game. I recently tried a handmade 10 player version with some additional improving rules, but still I felt bit bored. Not cause the player amount but because I kinda realised what's wrong with this game. The mechanics are kinda ok, but the map si the main reason why this game doesnt work. It's narrow and certain player dont meet for the entire game. Unless by some miracle you get control of the sea, there is a very little chance that Martel is gonna meet Stark on the battlefield. If Greyjoy is getting beaten by Stark he has basically no one to turn for help since Greyjoy is basically the only one who can attack Starks. (Yeah Baratheon could try launch something through sea but that would require a lot of effort, that could lose him the game on the other front.) Also the map could you some Landscape combat modifiers, like bonus to defense when the region is attacked from a region across the river, +1 bonus for support as a surprise attack for armies in forest and so on  to make it more stragetic for placing your armies and not just basic straight forward huge army from one region. The scheming part is highly dependant on the players and usually is non-existent. I'm probably rating this game higher than I should.

Played this game the other night, I can fully understand the appeal but overall the game felt too long winded and in comparison to similar games it added very little in the terms of game play.

I've never watched the TV series so have no opinion on the thematic s, i just feel a game of this length needs a higher level of depth and tactics.

RATING: 6
I loved this at first, until I realized that it's actually too thematic. Every single game I've played has ultimately been decided by a kingmaker. There's a lot of fiddliness and luck with the order of supply and mustering, and even more if you use the dreaded Tides of Battle cards. It only works with exactly 6 players, and it takes a whole day to play, so it's only a satisfying experience if you enjoy stabbing your friends in the back. And if you like that, more mechanically solid alternatives have come along since this one that require much less time investment.

RATING: 7
Trying to put the world of Westeros on the stage of a strategic level board game worked out okay.  Some things end up a little too deterministic since the combat doesn't involve random results unless optional rules are used.  Could use more flavor in the mechanics, but still a fun game.  I feel like this sort of game could have been done a different way and might have turned out better, but certainly a great game for a fan of the source material.

The game is best with max players, but I've only played it at 6, and 5. At 5 players, House Baratheon needs to be contested in Dorne.

For a big box Fantasy Flight game with a high profile license, this game is surprisingly tough and non-random. In fact, most of the variability comes from interaction between the players, scheming and backstabbing. Perfect adaptation of the source material in that sense! However, the game is very complex with a lot of moving parts and small rules to remember. A misunderstanding or a mistake can be really costly for a player. Also there is a strong risk of player elimination, or at least, a player having a really hard time. These factors, plus the long play time, are turning me off. Traded away my unplayed copy for Kemet in June 2014. Very likely to not play this again due to the high player count, long play time and complex rules.

So much back stabbing shenanigans I love it.

I think it can be a little frustrating when you get ganged up on, but alliances is a key part of the game, if you try to go it alone you will fail spectacularly. 

This game, maybe more than any other I have played is all about the timing of the stiletto point delivery under the shoulder blade, brutal, mean, badass.

Very long and restrictive game as far as the number of players go, in my opinion. Can be very good, but people need to be in the mood for this kind of game. This is an event game, epic and you have to take your time with it, making deals, plotting and backstabbing. The game feels pretty thematic, but is also pretty fiddly. I'd like to play more, especially the four player expansion.

I'm not sure how I feel about the new edition.  On one hand it seems to have made some much needed simple changes to correct the unbalancing of the houses in the original (especially when playing with less than 5 players).   I feel like this should be a good thing, but now when I play the game it almost feels too balanced.  All the games that I've played always go 10 rounds with not much changing on the board.  For all the short comings of the earlier edition I miss the sudden unexpected victories that seemed more common when playing it. I've played the original to death so it could be that I'm tired of this game and that the small (however meaningful) changes just are not enough to reignite my interest.  

I do enjoy the ADWD expansion though.

RATING: 3
4 hours of dudes on a map, even when played fairly quickly, is too long. Players that are doing badly can conceivably come back in to it, but that's fairly unlikely so a bad turn or two and you're looking at 2+ hours of watching other people think while you're reduced to the role of observer. Also, there really is nothing to prevent people from continuously attacking a weaker player, since each territory has some value, so why not just keep beating up on the weak?

The bidding for the three roles is moderately interesting, but with the amount of randomness in the events and when/how they trigger it's hard to see how the luck of the cards doesn't massively impact who wins. Oh, that and massive kingmaking opportunities.

This recreates and updates a lot of what Diplomacy does. I prefer GoT for being a lot faster, but it still doesn't deliver what I'm looking for in a game.

I've been playing this game with friends for a solid 3 years now pretty consistently. No other game that I have played has pulled me back so many times. The best way to play is with 6 players, all of whom have plenty of experience playing. This game requires that all players remain competitive and push for the victory condition. When this is the case, no other game I have played quite holds up to A Game of Thrones.

Currently my favorite game. My only criticism is that there are some balancing issues, but for similar reasons there are balancing issues in Risk. The map is already made and the game is based off that map which means there will be some areas with more advantages than others, Despite this there is much more diplomacy then risk because not only can you attack or not attack your enemies, you also can help in a battle your not even part of.

16-Dec-2012: Played this at EGF. It's a war game, which implies that to win, somebody will have to get attacked. Tight areas force players to go nose-to-nose. I do like the Order Token mechanic, and how Influence markers are used for bidding, and to control areas. Easy army management and combat resolution. Needs to be played cautiously though, and you're constantly at risk from at least 2 fronts. 

This game gives players the excuse to quote GoT lines like Winter is coming! Needs a particular type Of bloody thristy (and bloody minded) people to play. I'm happy not to own this - but would like another play to see if it improves my opinion on it.

This is - hands down - the best game in the world in my humble opinion, this game has it all, Social interaction, backstabbing, war, peace, stressing moment, panic, hatred, death, life, and wildings. There is very little randomness in this game, and you are 100% the engineer of your success, the skill level to manipulated the social game is very important, but your skill to understand when to make and break alliances are even more important. - love .. this... game...

Negotiation is possible, but it's not forced, that's perfect. I can never find people to play negotiation games with, even though I'd love that, but I can lure them into this game, because you're not forced with negotiations. Can't avoid conflict, also a big bonus. Rating may even go up when I get to play this game with 6 players?

I'm not familiar with the theme, but that didn't seem to matter. Then again I noticed it adding positive flavour for those who are familiar with it.

These comments are for the 2nd ed. The first edition has its own details.

A wonderful game that is a great experience with 6-players. The setup of the game puts everyone into brawl - conflict from two side immediately. It isn't for everyone and is a bit on the long side, but a great game.

Not good with 5. If you want to play with 5, you need the first ed map (with ports). This edition's map is not suited for 5.

For four players, you need the Feast for Crows exp, which changes the flavor a bit (still good, not as good).

Why would you want to play with 3?

This game has potential, but it's a slog. One player pushes, the others push him back. Do that for 3-5 hours. Long story short, the game is boring, which makes me sad because, if you've read or watched the series, you want to have fun with this game. And there are bursts of fun, but not enough.

There are limitations on orders, army size, and fighting capabilities. There are frustrating limits on the number of each type of troop you can deploy (why can't I raise another knight? -- just because, that's why). There are even limits on controlling territories you vacate. On the one hand, these restrictions encourage alliances with other players (good). On the other hand, they guarantee you won't hold on to any territory for very long (bad). Any feeling of accomplishment is quickly curtailed and undone unless the other players somehow manage to forget about you (unlikely).

Repeat this back and forth tug of war for up to ten total rounds. Mix in some random events, power cards, and secret auctions that will probably make the game swingy and frustrating. Maybe someone scores an instant victory. If not, everyone makes a wild push during the tenth and final round for whatever they can grab, regardless of their ability to support those final positions. Then someone wins. Did they earn that win? I don't know. More likely, it just so happens they came out ahead in the tug of war for that particular round. If the game was slightly shorter (or longer), someone else would have won -- and I'm not sure it would have that much to do with skill. It feels like it should be skill, but, well, maybe it's not. And that makes the whole experience feel a bit empty.

But the components are pretty, so that's good.

This game is tough, mean and not forgiving to those who aren't self seeking. Very true to its source material.

I really like the diplomacy that eventuates from the game's need for temporary alliances. As everyone is jostling to keep one another from reaching a game ending position, it's very bad gameplay not to continually forge and fracture alliances. But we are human, and this is where it gets interesting - can I let the Greyjoys get away with taking two of my territories last turn? Should I simply tell them I will support them and then watch them die a horrible death against the Lannisters? Or should I get over it and play 'the Game of Thrones?'

I like that it isn't 'total conquest' but rather relies on an endgame trigger, however I'm not sure how I feel about that combined with a round limit. Maybe it would have been better to let the game be open ended? I like the combat, the ability to support (although doesn't seem to get played enough), and the way actions are selected. The bidding is tense, and external threats make an interesting mix of co-operative and cutthroat competitive play.

In some ways I prefer the first edition and in some ways I prefer the second.  I definitely prefer the production of the first edition, which has much better clarity.  There are a few rules tweaks I like, though, so on balance I think they're about equal.

RATING: 7.5
Fun but feels a little unbalanced. Needs 6 players and and plays slow. A little random. Captures some of the backstabbing in the series.

RATING: 4
Each player takes on the role of a House of Westeros, attempting to use their resources and armies to take over the lands and declare themselves king, all while holding back the dangerous Wildling invaders from beyond Castle Black's walls.

There is a wealth of auctions, special abilities, clever card-play, negotiation, backstabbing, and strategic positioning that works well with the theme of the books/show. It's a bit long, and unbalanced in ways that I'm not sure I entirely appreciate, but it is a great "long game" that blows things like Risk away.

Perhaps made irrelevant to me by Ortus Regni?

RATING: 9.1
Strategy intrigue and politics in Westeros. This cut throat game is the love child of Risk and diplomacy but it's so much more than that. With the right group this game is so much fun. Just don't play it with people who can't get into the character of the game or folks who bare grudges and your good to go :)

RATING: 10
This game is just so fun... each turn, you have so many options... each faction is different and very enjoyable to try. Each combat is unqiue and memorable. There's a ton of strategy. I just LOVED this game.
...with 6 people.
Every player below the max you have, this game gets less fun. When you're down to 4, it's par for it's course... Down to 3? Don't even bother, it's a shadow of itself.
I don't know about you, I don't get 6 people together very much.
So I love the game, if you get the chance to play it with a decent group? Definitely do it. In regards to buying it? Ehhhh... unless you frequently have a lot people over to join you, I would advise against strongly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The first time I played this my jaw hurt, because I'd been inadvertently clenching it the whole time.  Wonderfully stressful and very evocative of the source material.

It does, however, really need six experienced players to shine, I think.  With only four or five whoever ends up next to an NPC faction is going to have a much easier time.  Likewise, a player who isn't as knowledgeable or aggressive as other players at the table might as well be served up on a platter.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great design and implementation give you a real feel of vying for power in Westeros. Good length but is unashamedly brutal as it should be, so not for everyone and can divide groups! 

The houses are a bit unbalanced too and the excuse of 'it doesn't matter, just make alliances' doesn't wash for me, if you're underpowered you are at a disadvantage, end of.

Cutthroat. Backstab. Area control.

Maybe if I was more into the show, or maybe if I didn't mind playing an area control game for 4 hours... maybe I would like this game better.

I haven't lost a game, but I don't really have fun at any point-- not even when going pacifist. I'm glad people enjoy it, but it's just not for me. (10-20-17)

I like the game. I was House Stark, and it's tough to win with that, but there were also some really awesome mechanics for First Player and event resolution. Combat is a little wonky, and felt that the rule book should have been written a little better.

RATING: 7
The imbalanced 4-player game and long playtime hamper what is otherwise a fantastic experience. Looks amazing and integrates the theme of the series into its mechanics very well. The simultaneous decisions, need for alliances and constant threat of random bids that can completely change the game make for a really fun game night with friends who love the series, as long as they can see past some minor issues.

I really like this game!  For being an intellectual property game, this one is a true winner.  Ally to conquer new lands, then backstab your friends before they do it to you!  Dropped a point for the "tides of battle" cards and the Fantasy Flight 35 page rulebook (use a player aid found in the files section!).  Also, don't play this with anarchists, because they will never bid to save you from the wildlings!

RATING: 8
This is completely unlike a 'Risk' or 'Axis and Allies' territory/unit war game. There is a 'tides of war' deck to introduce randomness similar to dice rolls, but is optional. The mechanics are really simple, but confusing for player's used to other war games. This magnifies the political arena between players. The rulebook is badly laid out, but the components are all top-notch.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The rating has fallen somewhat - the game is still very good and complex, and that's cool, but now it's less difficult to find people who are ready to play than to devote that much time to a single play of one game myself. I'll probably pick some shorter games and play them several times. But should I sit down and start playing, I'll likely not regret a single second spent on this.

3 of the logged plays have used my copy of the game.

RATING: 8.5
5-6 Spieler sind notwendig um jedem eine faire Chance zu geben. Das Spiel ist im ersten Moment für alle gleich, aber es ist asymmetrisch, denn die Gebiete sind sehr unterschiedlich und es kommt mehr auf Verhandlungsgeschick an, als auch Macht auf dem Brett.

RATING: 8.5
The theme and opportunities for negotiation make this game more than just the sum of its parts.  I have had epic levels of fun despite only ever winning one game with a masterful feint.  

I think this should never be played with an odd number of people.  With the full six it is brilliant.

Including reading the rules, my first game took 8 hours. Despite my attempts, nobody would ever play a second game with me because of this. Gameplay was fun though, I especially like the mechanic were turns occur simultaneously.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's basically a game of persuading people to do your dirty work, and it's fairly long and really REQUIRES 6.  If you play with less the map creates large advantages that require experienced players.  For instance with 5, Lannister and Baratheon need to go out of there way to stop Tyrell from running wild.

Basically the normal (maybe only) way to win without a time expiration is to lay lower and set a trap for a monster turn, which isn't really a plus.

Obviously the theme is solid here and that is probably the only thing that makes me sort of want to play it again.

RATING: 9.5
This was the first modern boardgame I purchased, and it took more than two years to make it to the table. It was worth the wait!

The game is designed in a manner that you are constantly engaged. Each part of the resolve action phase, raiding, marching units, consolidating power, happens in turn order so you're constantly doing an action or planning your next.

The game balances itself through use of alliances, as a runaway leader will soon be ganged up on. Combat has little random element to it, but still feels unpredictable.

Lastly, the graphic design and component quality it top notch, even for an older FFG game. I love ASOIF, and this is the only war game (besides Memoir '44) I'll ever need)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This won't be a 10 for everybody. This should, however, be a 10 for any Game of Thrones fans who can immerse themselves in the theme of a game. The mechanics are fantastic, but as I mentioned, the theme nails this one home. If you play the 6-player version, it truly feels like you're in Westeros planning a battle and bluffing your way to that highly anticipated victory!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I love this game, just feels so gosh dern long. Obnoxiously long some nights.

RATING: 4
This game is the embodiment of unfair. One player will start with the iron throne and when there is a bid war, and during the bid war, a tie occurs, the person already on the iron throne keeps it. The only way to get someone off the throne is to bid all your influence, which will leave you most likely as the last person on the other tracks due to the player previously on the iron throne still resolving ties.

The pieces in the game are also impossible to move around since they only move one space per turn. There are 10 turns in total and so that means you can only move 10 spaces max in the game. However an attack also counts as a move so if you fail an attack, it was a whole turn wasted going nowhere, making a new enemy and probably leaving yourself vulnerable to attacks from elsewhere on the board.

I understand this is the game of thrones and when you play you win or you die, but oh my god is it hard to die. The way you kill a piece is to use your cards (which the others can ask to see by the way) and use a sword card. The opponent can then simply block with a castle card that they have, leaving you one less powerful card in your hand. What will happen instead is you will push them back into an island by themselves where they will be screwed for the rest of the game. You're then left with a player that sits around watching others think for 6 hours complaining about how they can't do anything, and subsequently making the game even less enjoyable. At least if you die quickly you can do something else, but forcing a player to stay in a game where they have no hope of succeeding is unfair punishment.

I have many other qualms about the game such as bullshit boat victories and the kegs for armies but I think I have said enough. The only thing keeping this game from being lower is that I haven't yet played this game with 6. Hopefully it's a more enjoyable experience (although it's going to need a freakin miracle).

Excellent and thematic diplomacy wargame. From a euro prespective, it's area control at its best.

It has a strong, well intergrated theme, provides strong varying narrative, has varying factions and no luck. You need to outplay, outsmart and deceive your opponents while at the same time negotiating. Multi-track competition and occasional cooperation blend extraordinarilly well together and elevate the game into a masterpiece.

The factions have standard starting positions, and therefore the first turns can perhaps be easily scripted and some alliances appear more often than not. This detracts from replayability but adds to the theme, so for me it is acceptable. Still, it does detract from the diplomatic options quite a bit.

4p is working flawlesly, 5p is even stronger but I expect the 6p games to be even more action packed and fun.

Note: The game has an excellent variant included that is often neglected - the battle cards that affect the results of battles. What these cards practically do is add some minor luck to the battles - not much, just as much as needed. What this means in practice is that players will stop trying to "chess" the game (aka trying to figure all the luck free possibilities to choose from) and be more open to generally attacking, even at a bit suboptimal odds. This greatly speeds the game with many players, and forces a meta game of nerves where picking a general is no longer just a matter of maths, but also a matter of battle importance - as it should be.

RATING: 7.8
Such a thematic game. Players vie for power, and to ultimately hold 7 castles/strongholds. Players may battle, align, and backstab one another. It took me forever to get this to the table, and was quite impressed with the game once I finally did.

An OK take on the Dudes on a Map meets Starcraft/Runewars style hidden orders meets back stab your opponent meets bluff your opponent with your hand of cards while bidding for stuff most turns. I enjoyed the experience, but it went way too long and was VERY fiddly- even for an FFG title.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Urgh! This is my absolutely most hated game! I detest every little piece of it. 

Where to even begin? Ok let's start simple: 

Scales absolutely terribly! Nothing but a full game is completely broken! Here's the thing, if you do not have a full game, then some passive, useless, dumb-looking NPCs are placed in replacement. These are always placed at the bottom of the map! Meaning that the player near these have an incredible advantage! As these useless pieces have NO attack capabilities, and there is this unit in the game which is massively strong on the offense, but weak in defense - you can kinda see how this does not work one tiny bit

You have to house rule this otherwise the game is just over before it even begins. (Doesn't help the faction at the top of the map who is just bloody screwed no matter what house rule because they have less movement options and have to spilt their navy into two sides unlike any other faction)

And the randomness, Ohhhh the randomness. You see, you bid randomly like an idiot for the different powers of the game. These bids show up randomly during the game, so sometimes it was good you used all your money to get the most power, and other time the game goes "lolz - we vote again" in just one measly round. Congrats you just lost everything. 

One time I wanted to think long term, so I wanted to get even more income in the 2. round by sacrificing some in the first. But then the game went "LOL screw you" and had us adjust these things only in the first round. (Cause of course this is decided randomly too). Of course there was no adjustment in forever after this, so I just sit around forever with no ressources until the game mercilessly let me continue playing it half way through (A good fun 3 hours...) - of course at this point it was already over and chance of victory has long since escaped my grasp, but that's okay cause the game only takes half a day to complete anyway.

Another great example is that one of the factions starts with the throne power or whatever (It's thankfully been a while since I played this monstrosity), and if bidding for powers comes up in the very first round none has any real money and ties are broken by the throne power - harhar guess who now has the highest power 3 areas?? Those dudes! The fact that they can get a lead this early for no reason on than "it's just one of those draws, yo" just reeks of imbalances in this game. 

This game is all about staying friends with folks and it's all decided by having the most castles at the end. Well this usually just leads to the most "passive sit on your ass cause otherwise you are gonna get a mortal enemy which WILL cost you the game" gameplay (cause there is no other real reason to attack one dude over another) and then for the final round everyone just groups up their dudes and tries to capture as many castles as possible in the final round - hoping that the others decide to go a route that spares your castles - if they do - congrats you won. What an accomplishment after bloody half a day of sitting around having random event cards tell you how well you are doing. 

Hate hate hate hate! It's so bad! I haven't even scratched the surface of the many many flaws in this game!

I would rather play bloody Risk than this cause at least in Risk there is no illusion of it being good and no massive random imbalanced during the game. At least risk doesn't go "screw you, I'm taking all your stuff" right in the middel (or beginning or end) of the game.


The only good thing I can say is that I guess it's thematic and looks good, cause just like the TV show you get to watch all the things you fought for die for no reason.

RATING: 7.5
Great looking game but complex with a lot of rules to keep in mind. Lots of downtime during turns and thats why I don't play it too often. It gets more enjoyable the more I play it though and thats a good thing. What I dislike about the game is that some starting locations have an advantage over others. Best with 5 or 6 players.

This game is beatiful, but it hasn't a top score for me cause it can't hit the table as i would to, primarly because it must be played with full player's count and, with that number of players, the duration grows hour after hour. I don't also like the impact of the westeros' phase.

I'm a huge fan of this game partially for my love of ASOIAF as well as the intense strategy and layers it provides. Only issues are a lot of variable and it can be daunting for new gamers. You also need 6 players to properly play as the Southern Houses (Martell and Tyrell), which isn't great when playing with a small group.

It's a game that seems difficult at first, seems easy once you've played it, but is actually really strategic. The game awards tactical thinking and, very thematically so, forging alliances and eventually breaking them. 

The game becomes slightly unbalanced with 3 or 4 players, and really shines with 5 or 6 players. More players does dramatically increase play time, requiring an afternoon or evening to be dedicated to this game. 

Takes a long time to play and requires an investment. Some sides are definitely more powerful than others if you're playing with inexperienced people. 

Also own Feast for Crows.

In the second edition of A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, three to six players take on the roles of the great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, as they vie for control of the Iron Throne through the use of diplomacy and warfare. Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!

Sometimes player elimination is better than the devices created to avoid it.

I've played A Game of Thrones three times. Each time at least one player is virtually stripped of his or her territory (or indeed stripped of it entirely) but is forced to play on for another hour or two with no meaningful involvement in the game.

The mood of that player inevitably sinks, and brings down the mood of the rest of the table.

As a board game developed from the system of "Diplomacy", this is the best game now. 
Especially this 2nd edition takes in well the good portions of the 1st edition and its 2nd and 3rd expansion, and it is in particular feeling fine in refined board game.
The battle card of the optional rule should be taken   by all means and this does a battle more unpredictably and does it in exciting development.

It is interesting enough to be playing in three.
When players increase, it is this type of game that "House Lannister" becomes severe and it is unavoidable as geopolitics, but I consider that it was better for there to be adjustment of balance to a slight degree according to the number of players.

Get ready to spend your whole night playing this game, I've never had a session last less than 4 hours. Also be prepared to lose friends when you completely screw them over to solidify your choke hold on the north. Table talk and collusion is highly encouraged. It really adds to the gameplay and makes you feel like you're in Game of Thrones.

It takes A LOT of time to play this game. I dislike the card play mechanics for combat. Yet, it has some nice qualities as well, like offering some interesting possibilities for meta-gaming and backstabbing... but again, this creates some problems like king-making and player elimination (in practice).

I was looking forward to this just from the general praise I had heard from friends and from boardgamegeek. 

Unfortunately I had picked the Lannisters without really understanding their predicament of being the "worst" faction to start off with. Before the game even started, one of the players harped on for about 5 minutes as to why my faction was the worst.

What proceeded was nothing short of bemusement. A few turns in, everyone realised I was about to win before even I knew I was about to win. I had stumbled my way into the headlights of all the other players. 

The players then planned to attack me on multiple fronts which was expected. What was not expected was an attack from a player who I believed could not reach me. I had misread the board state due to some devious placement of ships on the opposite side of the board. I was not impressed.

Board games to me are a competition in decision making. If I'm stuck gaming with people who believe that you need to win at all costs then that's the day I quit this hobby for good. As to whether I'll play this game again? I doubt it. The map is busy, the components are clumsy (the armies defending territories are pretty big and obscure the board), the cards are numerous (so you need to learn all the cards before you can even successfully navigate the mire of combat) and the game play isn't that compelling. Why bother?

I realised from this experience that I really dislike heavy negotiation games. Watching players plead with each, make snide remarks or cajole weaker players into bad positions is not my idea of entertainment. It's like being around a whole bunch of marketers trying to sell you things that you're not interested in. That's pretty much my idea of hell.

EXCELENTE wargame, muito bem pensado, cheio de estratégia, variações e possibilidades. Tem a grande desvantagem de ter muitas etapas e vários detalhes importantes que podem passar despercebidos ao longo do jogo se não houver alguém experiente junto e assustar alguns jogadores mais casuais. Também pode ser bastante extenso com muitos jogadores. Mas assim que se acostuma com a mecânica, garante muita diversão, intriga, raciocínio e combates para quem gosta de jogos de guerra. É tudo que o War deveria ser, mas não é. JOGÃO!

RATING: 5.5
Don't get it wrong - it's a well designed game. But...

Personally, I really dislike all this Game of Thrones related stuff - but neither the TV series nor the book is what I'm writing here about. I heard that this is a good game, so I put away my antipathies and gave it a try. The first edition was released long before GoT started to be a buzz, thus it may not be just another GoT-themed product. And I wasn't underwhelmed.

A Game of Thrones is a very good board game. It's mechanics gives you the variety of "nice" feelings (really they're driven by the game mechanics!) - power struggle, backstabbing, treason and more. All time you or other players have to make a choice who will take some kind of negative effects ("take that"), you have to make alliances and break it a bit later, you have to be coldblooded - that's the only way to the Throne.

Game of Thrones fans should be pleased, but I'm not one of them, I definitely do not enjoy all of this. It's just not the way I like to spend time playing board games. That's all. It's not for me.

With all above said, the game has a few flaws. Sometimes it feels too random, even a careful strategy can't save you from a bad roll (or rather a bad draw), your army will be annihilated and you have to wait for another random event to rebuild it. Houses are unbalanced - some are undoubtedly better situated than others. The map is a bit vague - it's easy to miss a boundary and make a terrible mistake. Last but not least, it has a horribly long playing time (even 4-5h!) - without this I would consider playing it from time to time (when in a right mood).

Great game, but incredibly long. Playing GoT almost always resulted in someone getting close to tears. I enjoy the way combat is handled, but since this game almost requires 6 players to be balanced and has an extremely long downtime, it has become a game that I will only play on certain unique circumstances.

Great grand strategy with all sorts of tweaks like bidding, hidden order placement and card management. A longish player skill balanced (the board setup might be unbalanced but skilled players prevent anyone from getting too far ahead) game with great many moving parts, bluff and interaction. Many good things brought in from the extensions of the first edition making this box a very complete edition. Don't use the tides of battle unless the players are truly unmatched (as in few hardcore veterans facing a few first-timers). Only works with 5+ players, unrewarding with less.

The unholy spawn of Risk and Diplomacy. Given what I scored those two (3 and 1 respectively) I'm surprised I gave this a 4. To be fair it's not as awful as either of its two forebears, but suffers from problems all of its own: a brutally constrained board, wild faction imbalances, and a hugely long game length for what is essentially a simple land-grab wargame.

The second edition board is ugly. And Martel and Barathenon both have Yellow pieces (thematic but unfortunate).

interesting and not too complex war game. Only the play time is a bit too long, it easily takes up to more than 3 hours to play.
Every player gets a house, a region and the same starting conditions. Then you start with secretely plan your moves and play the tokens hidden. You can move, cancel an opponents action, recruit, get victory points, etc.
Then everyone reveals and makes their actions.
I really enjoyed it, but the cunning and cutthroat theme or feeling does not come into play here. You will hardly make any deals with the other players which is a bit of a pity.
There is also the "kingmaker" problem. If someone does not really want to play anymore he is likely to give an opponent an easy victory.
But all in all this is a very cool game

The game takes too long. I'll start with that. It takes too long to learn, and it takes too long to play a pilot game, and it takes too long with experienced players. But it is fun. It is like risk, minus the frustrating and often ridiculous luck dependency. 

The biggest issue other than the length of the game is the constant bickering about the balance. I don't think it is broken. Imbalanced is when a player can do much more than you, inherently. In this game, some players start in different locations, some making it harder to break out, but this is not a 2 player game. It is a diplomatic game. If you feel you are at a disadvantage, and you truly are, no one is going to pick on you, you inch your way and you take a different route to the same goal. If you consider that a major flaw in the game design, then this game is not for you. You may also want to rule out a whole bunch of games that do not have identical/near-identical starts.

Lot of parts I liked to the game, and I'm sure I'd rank it higher with more plays.  Just feels too long, too much downtime, some frustration with the cards, little fiddly.  There's a lot of just beating back and forth on eachother and the game comes down in the end just to who can betray their buddy the best. I'd rather play more involved games with quicker resolutions.  This game felt drawn out without the "epic" feel at the end.

The combat is really interesting, and without dice there's a lot of clever tactics. On top of that, I really like that troops aren't always killed, so you can regroup and try again. Voting for powers is really cool too. However, mustering troops completely kills this game for me. It is so important to muster troops that being shut out leaves you out of the game, especially early on, when building your army is so important. Even worse is you have no idea when extra musters will appear from the deck, or when a voting round to get a spot on the raven track will appear. In my first game voting happened once on the first turn and didn't happen again until the 7th, leaving anyone that didn't get to muster shut out of the game. For a 3-5 hour game this is completely unacceptable. On top of that not knowing how long you're bidding for your slot inexcusable. Power is hard to come by, and considering how decisive and calculable combat is, it's ridiculous to have a randomly determined bid for the ability to muster troops which you may get for only one turn, or you may have for the rest of the game.

RATING: 9
An amazing area control game for 6 players. There is never any down time for players since turns are integrated and the mechanics are very well thought out. No dice means it's almost all strategy with just a little luck thrown in here and there with a few global event cards.

Only complaint, and it may go away with more plays and learning the strategy. The win condition seems just a little shallow. It makes story sense (No one army in Westeros tried to take the whole continent) and it makes time sense (getting 7 castles can take you 4 hours as is). I guess when I go to sit down at a conquest game I imagine more, well conquest.

Still a great game though! It's easy to pick up and learn and I think it will be my "long game" choice for a good long time.

I love the first edition of this game, and this is basically the same thing.  There's a few teeny-tiny changes, but you're going to either love them both, or hate them both.  It feels a little bit cheap giving a 10 out to both versions, but they're so similar that there's no way to make a distinction in the ratings.

As for a direct comparison, I give the nod to the first edition.  The pieces are a bit better in the second edition, especially the player screens and the card art, but the first edition expansions allow the game to play well with 4-6 players, while the second only truly shines with exactly six.  The added options of the expansions are icing on the cake.

When we play it the whole atmosphere changes. It really feels like you were in game of thrones. It requires a lot of strategy, diplomacy, and the replayability is high (of course the starting positions are the same, but the more we play it, the more different strategy comes.) Random factor is low due to its paralell effect on each player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One three player game behind, we were all first timers. It took time of course, but we knew this beforehand and had a relaxed approach for the game. We didn't have much tactics, it was generally agreed that at the start it is good to expand. In the mid-game we tried lots of things quite a lot and only the end game was like real play.

The game was enjoyable for us all and we are waiting for the next game with bigger group.

The pieces could be better, knight and siege engine can be easily mixed.

Update after 3 games: The game is good, but it takes 6+ hours with us. If the length would be two hours shorter, then this would get a better rating. With the gained experience on the game play, the tactics and play have been better.

Updated after 4 plays, last two with the Feast for Crows expansion and the game is close to 8 now - the latest play took 4 and half hours, which is quite ok.

Updated after 7th play, now I have tried with Tides of Battle -cards and with 5 and with 6 players. Good game, but I would like to have quicker opponents. One of the plus sides is the theme, if the houses and characters would have been something generated only for this game, this would be much drier and not so good.

Updated after 8th play (three players), still a good game, but takes lots of time. With three players it is probably very difficult to end the game before the 10th round. Faster opponents (and/or sober players?) would be a nice bonus.

9th play was again with three players, it took 4 hours and ended on turn 6. So my last comment is no longer 100% valid. Good game, but lengthy. Needs to played more often.

10th play was with four players (and expansion) and again quite nice 4 hours. A good game.

11th play (2nd with 6 players) in 5 hours, it was good. It could have been faster, if some players would have not been so tired or so much affected by drinking a day before... :) So the game is now faster than before and it feels good. Very close to updating the rating to 8.

12th play with three players and it took almost 6 hours now...

14th play was with 6 and only 5 hours. We played during the day, not on the evening, thou. :)

Great job of being faithful to the source material, lots of negotiations, strategy, alliances and of course backstabbing. Some very well designed mechanisms make for a true high strategy war game.

1st play was ok. So many rules. We played with five, two guys and three girls. Me and the other guy were very into it and exited about the game (both GOT fanboys) but the girls were less patient. We finished the game with me as the winner and it took us over three hours. Next game should go better because we don't have to look at the rulebook as much. Fortunately the girls (my GF and her two sisters) wanted to try again too. Im curious how our next experience will be. For now i rate this game a 6.5 but i'm sure this will go up after the next few games. Will give a more detailed review with the next update.

I am in love with this game.If i could find 5 other like minded individuals i would play it every week.
The second edition board looks 'busier' than the first edition one,but almost every aspect of the production is well executed and beautiful.
Gameplay is elegant and simple,nothing too intricate or complicated ruleswise,although the strategy and diplomacy inherent in the game might make for heavy going in your first couple of games.Combat is card based,with almost perfect knowledge of your odds of winning,which i know some people will not like,but the meat and potatoes of the game comes from the constantly shifting alliances within the game.Every player needs the support of other players during the game,but not neccesarily the same players and not neccesarily for long.Players who go it alone invariably lose.
Nice to play a conquest game where the sides are not balanced,where negotiation is as important(if not moreso) than military might and where there is a finite turn limit.
 The only down side is that the game does NOT scale down well.5 or 6 players is the absolute minimum really,with 6 being the sweet spot.

This is a perfect game for me, though that may change once I play it more (3 times total I think). I love the hidden order system. I love that the goal is defined. In many games people might avoid aggression because they can get their goal without it and they don't want to risk making an enemy. In GoT, you have to pick a fight to win, the trick is so does everyone else and they know it. Combat being deterministic is also a big plus for me. People don't complain about dice and make comments like "Aw, I didn't see that option!" instead. 

I guess the weakness of the game comes from board position of various factions. I haven't played enough for this to be evident.

Played it only once at a con on a giant hand-made map with miniatures. Probably that added as the extra fun factor. But nevertheless, I can see there is a solid game with interesting combat and diplomacy aspects. This was my first 'war' game (well technically the first one is Risk, but it shouldn't be counted). I like the combat mechanisms in this better than other combat games I have played like Eclipse or Scythe.

This re-release does a nice job of folding various expansion mechanics from the first edition into the core rules of the second. I'm not a huge fan of the new playing pieces, as certain colors and shapes can be hard to tell apart, but for the most part the new edition is very nicely put together. I'm glad Fantasy Flight was able to re-release this design, because it would have been a tragedy if this game wasn't available to take advantage of the atmosphere that the HBO adaptation has created in Pop culture.

The game itself is neat experience that manages to deliver some of the backstabbing military moves and broken promises that are such an integral part of the books. Like most games that rely on social interaction to create intrigue and mistrust, A Game of Thrones will only work if the players let it. If they are not willing to engage in copious amounts of table talk or gang-up on players that leave themselves exposed then the game can become somewhat stale and predictable. This game is meant for the Diplomacy crowd, so if you aren't willing to ride the razor's edge of a table flip, then you had best stay away.

Update 2018: This game has dropped from 9.2 to 8.5 because it is really hard to get the usual group together lately that we used to play this game together.

It is among my favorite games, I love the mix of strategic and diplomatic game-play, there is high level of player interaction and very thematic. Would be a 10 if the game was could play as good in lower player counts and the play time was shorter.

RATING: 7
I like this more than my memory of the first edition, though it's been several years since I played the older one. This was largely because I felt like there was less blind bidding this time out.

My biggest issue with it is that it seems the event decks have a bigger impact on the outcome of the game than they ought to for a game of this length. Having core mechanics like mustering or supply tied largely to chance seems hard to adjust for; in my first play of this, we finished the game without adjusting supply once, and it turned out all 3 supply cards were at the bottom of the deck. I appreciate some element of chance in games, but not when I feel like the outcome largely depended on when the cards came up.

Not to sound too down on it - after all, one still has to put themselves in a situation where they can take advantage of the cards should they arrive. Like a lot of Fantasy Flight's bigger titles that I've played, the game is very good at creating a specific mood (in this case, Diplomacy-like negotiations) while being perhaps overly complex mechanically and not necessarily satisfying on its own. And I still think it's not nearly as good as the similar Starcraft game.

If Star Wars rebellion is star wars in a box, than this is GOT in a box.  This game is fantastic and the theme is strong with this one.  I mean I really feel like the Starks hailing from Winterfel trying to storm over Westeros, and if I am not careful trampled by my brotherman.  I think the game is played best with the full compliment of 6 but if you have the expansion for four than I would play that way.  Awesome tactical game with a lot going on but still awesome.  I love that the battle system is all through number strength and card play, it makes for a more strategic game.

My first (and last i hope) game ended with a three-way tie, someone else deciding who is the winner. Talk about kingmaking. I guess it's somehow thematic but I just don't ever want to play games like this anymore. In the end I feel like we could have just voted for the winner in 30 seconds instead of playing for hours.

My #1 favorite game. I am not a big war/conflict game fan, but this strategic war-like game hits a home run. I love how everyone reveals their orders at the same time, in addition to the awesome bid for power mechanic. Sure, there are a few times where one might just get screwed because the right cards do not come up, but that is minor. The House cards in combat are brilliant, as you really have to do some guesswork to see what your opponent would play. Amazing game, will ALWAYS play.

[i]Rating for the full 6-player experience (the base game just doesn't work properly with fewer players):[/i]

I'll be honest - I get to play this game a couple of times a year at best. But whan I finally do, oh what a treat it is. This is a fantastic game with super strong, immersive theme. Look no further if you want a board game that combines strategy with diplomacy. Playing this game for the first time was a breakthrough moment for me, I immediately wanted to explore the whole world of board games.

But as much as I love it, it's not without its flaws:
- out of the box this game really works with 6 players only, there are some serious balance issues when playing with fewer players. Fortunately A Feast for Crows expansion fixes problems connected with 4p games (and there's a nice fan-made printable 5p overlay available on BGG);
- the gameplay can really drag when playing with beginners or people prone to AP, be ready for a 4-6 hour session with the full player count (A Dance with Dragons expansion significantly cuts the overall length so get it if you want a shorter game with 6 players);
- static setup forces players to act in a certain way - early turns may feel a little scripted (this concerns primarily early conflict between Lannisters and Greyjoys). 

Still, whenever someone suggests playing GoT, I'll be the first guy at the table. A Game of Thrones is unlike anything else. One of the finest "dudes on the map" games out there.

[i]I own the following expansions: A Dance with Dragons, A Feast for Crows.[/i]

Wow.  I played a 6 player game and right away I decided this is a game for me.  It has, in my opinion, a lot of similarities to Runewars-a game that I love.  I did some research and was not surprised to find out some of the same designers worked on both games.  So I bought this puppy up right quick and let the adventure begin.  I do believe being a fan of the books or show helps a lot, but I wouldn't let that stop you from at least trying it.

My rating of 7 is a bit preliminary and based off of one abbreviated game (8 out of 10 rounds). It's also based on some house rules that the owner/teacher introduced, that I think probably hurt the game quite a bit. I need to try this game again without those house rules and with the 4 or 5 person overlays if we have fewer than 6 players.

The war game mechanics work well and create some tense and engaging battles AND thematically adds the thrill of betrayal.  But, our group feels that the houses have distinct starting territory advantages.  After a handful of plays at four player, we have learned that if we play this game again it has to begin with the Ironborn and Lannister players forming an early alliance to run over and keep Baratheon from turtling a massive empire while keeping an eye on Stark.

The game that got my board game group started. Thematically it's one of the best games I have. It really captures the essence of the A Song of Ice and Fire series of strategy, politics, alliances and betrayal. An well crafted game but after 30+ games it has a few flaws:
1. With less than 6 players it is a little imbalanced and I wouldn't really bother with 3 or 4 player games
2. It's a fairly long game (although with our experience we can bang out a 6 player game in less than 2 hours)
3. The raid order is "cheap" in that it reduces the amount of potential alliances in the game

Loved it. Haven't yet played a 4-player game, but the 5 and 6 player variants were great, and even the 3-player was surprisingly good. 

I'd note that playing a good game seems to require a little bit of curating. In other words, games can be really imbalanced if an experienced player doesn't prompt people on a couple major strategy points before you start. Namely, I think it's important for everyone to realize immediately that because everyone starts in close proximity, alliances can be really important. I also think it's important to set a precedent for what those alliances can be. Game-long alliances can be really unfair. I prefer a turn-by-turn non-aggression pact kind of thing which offers a lot more balance and flexibility.

RATING: 7
Not as good as I expected, due partly to the high score on BGG. I found it decent but more of a beer and pretzels type game rather than a serious strategic and/or tactical affair. I felt that while strategy existed; in a game this long there was too much randomness meaning I didn't feel I had enough control over the game to make a win feel skilled on my part.
When it comes to making alliances with other players and backstabbing, it is the best game I have played though so kudos for that.
It is just too easy for someone's consistent good fortune with things like Westeros cards to be a major factor.
And of course, if you like Game of Thrones (I don't) then it is a huge plus I guess. Despite not knowing anything about Game of Thrones though, the theme in this game is still really neat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Really good asymetrical area majority game.  However, our first game was with 4 players, and it seems the board layout favors the player with the Baratheon house, where that player should be able to win the game fairly easily.  The reason is that you win the game by controlling castles, and most of the castles are on the Baratheon side of the board, where that player is free to just move in and take them without having to fight off the players on the other side of the board.  With 5 or 6 players, that advantage should be mostly gone.  Nonetheless, the game moves quickly (though it's not short), and there's plenty of meat for advanced gamers.

The game is very enjoyable but it needs 6 players, and 6 players committed to play long hours at that. Everything below 6 makes the game very predictable and unbalanced and the whole thing goes downhill fast. The 4 player expansion is fixing things a bit but then it becomes quite random.  I would recommend it if you have a fixed group of 6 which can maintain focus over long hours of playing.

9 If you're a Game of Thrones fan. Really throws you into the world of Westeros. Although it can strain friendships with backstabbing. On the flip side, it can strengthen friendships with alliances! Even non-Game of Thrones fans can get into it and have a good time.

RATING: 6
First of all, this game has to be played with 6 players. The game lose a lot of interest if there's less than 6 players invovled. 
I have to say the diplomacy and political aspect of the game is great! It provides tense and nice moment within players that can destroy friendships just like a game like that should do!
BUT, I always had the same experience with that game: it gets super stale. I have spent games where almost nothing happened because nobody would dare do anything other than defend and support because the stakes are too high.  To me, the game does not push you enough to take risks.

I've been waiting a long time for the 2nd edition to come out. I never got to play the first one as finding the right kind and quantity of players is hard.

Played 3 times, once with 5, twice with 6 players. This game never really got off the ground for me; it will probably go down as the game which destroyed any of my remaining enthusiasm for long games which are based primarily on negotiation.

RATING: 9.5
This WOULD be my favorite game, if there was just some way to solve the Greyjoy/Lannister imbalance. One way of fixing this is to let noobs play with Greyjoy and the most practised player control Lannister (unless it's you ^^). But if all the players have experience, you're just gonna have to gang up on those damn Krakens!

RATING: 6
I loved the first three books of A Song of Ice and Fire, but was sadly let down by book four, and all but the very end of book five. Therefore this game appeals to me greatly. I used to rarely, if ever, have the chance to play any six player game, especially if they were remotely long or heavy. This has changed, and a new very good friend even owned this game and brought it along to a scheduled event to introduce all of us to the game.

First of all this game does a great job of capturing its theme. I am definitely open to play again, but will perhaps not clamor for it, because it felt a bit long. Granted, we were all beginners, and I already learned a hell of a lot, and made mistakes I'm not likely to make again.

If it wasn't an event game this would see a hell of a lot of play, and if someone could convince me that a full six player game could take as little as 3-4 hours, then I'd gladly play this frequently.

I'm curious to play the two expansions. Both A Feast for Crows to check out the four player game with House Arryn, and especially the stacked A Dance with Dragons for a six player game up to date with the end of book five of A Song of Ice and Fire, and a much more urgent start position.

One disappointment to me was how limited the negotiation aspect felt. Sure, this could easily be chalked up as a rookie mistake or misunderstanding, but I played Tyrell, and there was just not much reason for me and House Stark to ever really negotiate over anything in my so far one and only game.

This game definitely deserves a second play to lock in my rating.

I really dislike this game. Firstly I dislike the fact that the richest get way too much power in the game as they get access to these awesome game-changing items you can bid for, while the other guys sitting with few resources sit like ducks while the others make the game. It's fine to give an edge to the players who are doing good in the game, but with this one it feels so irreversible. There is NOTHING you can do to come back in the game. Secondly, it is sooooo slow to play. Lots of waiting time, planning phase is AWFUL and very little thrill in return. Even fights are uninteresting. Focuses too much on the combat aspect, I thought Game of Thrones was more about the intrigues between the houses rather than plain war even if I understand it also is an aspect of it. It felt like we played Risk and that the goodies were just for the guys sitting with piles of resources while I looked at the only castle I owned all game. Also, there seems to be huge balance issues with this game, so yeah this is a no-go for me. This said I am a huge fan of the TV series. I just didn't feel the theme in the game aside from the board and the Direwolf/Lion on the back of my cards. Rest is non-existent.

A really intense game that will start off with everyone avoiding conflict and generally not much happening in the first three turns but then someone will do something closer to the second half and everything will really kick off, alliances are formed and wars started. This game will really make your heart race in the last 2 or three turns as you scramble to make sure that everything goes right so that you can come out on top. I would not recommend playing with less than five players. If you do play with less then what I do is not allow players in most of the Dornish lands as this ensures more conflict and stops the Tyrells and Baratheons from having some free castles. I also don't play with the tides of battle cards, I never have I liked the idea of having less luck aspects in the game. This is a great game to play if you can find some competitive friends.

This does seem to improve the original in a lot of small ways.  I like the more balanced faction cards and the subtraction of the usually confusing spectial house power tiles.  I'm mixed on the combat deck.  I think I prefer playing without it as it seemed to matter more than the house card selection in the game I played... but people who like a splash of randomness to their combat should find it to be perfect.

I could see my rating going up with more plays, but my first game was short and anti-climactic as the other experienced player pretty much won while the new guys were still feeling out the system. I didn't have much of a chance to play my copy as Eclipse totally ate all my epic game nights so I traded it away.

Excellent game, tons of strategy without being too complicated. 

Only downside is that I have seen several "out-of-no-where" victories, that are very hard to anticipate.

Like Diplomacy only more compelling. Betrayals and alliances that get built over the coarse of a play-through make revenge or victory truly satisfying. It's also one of the few games where I would settle for not winning as long as one particular player/house loses as well!

I can't give this more than 7. If you play it with 6 players it is a 9 but anything else makes the game less fun and it's not always easy to find 6 players

A very solid strategy game, with refreshingly simple combat, and an amazing range of choices. 4 players seemed a bit lopsided, and the port rules were a bit confusing, but everything else made perfect sense, and was very enjoyable. 6 players was amazing and challenging. Game was up in the air the entire time.

Fun game of backstabbing your friends. Can be long and AP prone. Possibly some issues of being out of contention long before the game is over.

Better than the first edition.  The game works reasonably well and works best with all 6 players.  The limited number of combat units and randomness of supply cards can result in some very artificial games if you are not able to periodically reset your supply/army size.  There should be a default supply reset/check because if it is turn 8 and you are still using the supply you had at turn 2, it really distorts your armies. The factions are still unbalanced.

I've only played with the Feast for Crows expansion and if the game went longer I would probably reduce my rating. There's plenty of opportunity to wheel and deal, and the hidden scoring allows for the possibility of some really great wow moments. I love the IP and this does it justice.

Beautiful components, intuitive gameplay. With all six players, the game takes too long for what it is. A typical tight and crowded area control game, with the war fronts going back and forth and back again. Needs some kind of thematic distraction from all the combat; I can't help but think of the expeditions and council politics in Warrior Knights. However, the theme alone raises this one above other similiar games.

What a game! The definite A Song of Ice and Fire experience. The theme of the book and tv series is very strong as the game is full of backstabbing, alliancies change every round and each player immediatelly dive into their house roles. Planning phase and blind bidding are excellent. The only negative is that in my opinion you have to be a series fan in order to fully enjoy it. Love it!

Very good grand strategy game that captures AGoT theme well and has an excellent structure. My only complaint is that they didn't take the theme far enough and give each house 1 rule-breaking power to add flavor and a little more role-playing, a la Dune, which is still the gold standard for IP interpretation.

But, our group immediately realized this is a great game that needs a simple tweak to make it our go-to throw down game.

Sangre, miradas fingidas, hostiles y de pura ira. Un juego violento y feroz, en el que no hay amigos, sino vecinos cuya palabra no vale más que la mentira. Jugado con la compañía adecuada es pura finura, un juego para tramar la perdición de los demás, de ellos, y de sus tierras para tu exclusivo beneficio.

Ok game that combines strategy, diplomacy and bluffing but also has some annoying random elements in it and with unbalanced factions due to geography and cardeffects. 

Good points : it has subtile strategies and layers that are not always visible to new players. Combat is done well and without dice. Secret action selection phases are very cool and interesting mechanic. 
 
Some minor points : the supply mechanic is sometimes a little bit too restrictive. Not everything feels very well balanced. It requires at least 5 players, while 6 is very good. Do not play it with 3 or 4. The event cards should be turned visible for the next turn, so players can plan a strategy for them. A little bit stale on negotiating side, not that much diplomacy eventually. Combat is slow since there are neutral area's to be captured first. 

On balance: The balance is bad in this game. I usually play house Lannister but they are the most difficult to play due to horrible starting position. Lannister player is very dependant on what Greyjoy does and it's very probable that they'll never win if all players know what they are doing. 
It's as if the designers didn't care about balance and just hoped that diplomacy would balance the game, but that's not very intelligent design. 

On popularity: now that everyone knows about agot I find it a bit odd that this is the official boardgame for Agot that people will get into their hands, as this is a pretty complex game for new gamers.

Read the book.

Watch HBO.

But ...

Play this game via forum only. It's perfect for forum play with all the backstabbing that is hard to negotiate while you sit beside the table.

Great game for 6 players, would recommend using the alternate rules for 4 players (north blocked off, only southern families used).  Take time to really learn the rules and research any you are unsure of.  There are quite a few that can be misinterpreted at first, but once played correctly can completely change the game.

I like games that try to pick up where Diplomacy left off, but seems to have many balance issues and AP problems. At least it's shorter than Diplomacy. But it seems like Diplomacy plus a lot of work, which still ultimately comes down the diplomacy part.

Having the Supply event not happen often, and especially if it happens late the first time, can seriously affect the game.

Лучшая стратегия всех времен и народов. Для тех, кто может оставить все обиды за столом. Союзы и предательство. Отвага и удары в спину... И классная механика! Раздача приказов, треки короны, меча и ворона, влияние, снабжение, несложный подсчет боя... Всё очень хорошо переплетается между собой.

Rating after 1 play; unlikely it'll be more. 
- High learning curve. 
- Game seems to be for 6 only (which we had)
- Wildling track which affects players based on bids, not proximity to the north, seems to be a hugely tacked on mechanic.
- Only 1 influence track REALLY matters. 
- Card play to determine battle outcome didn't appeal to me: tacked on and erratic results due to the texts. 
- Player elimination by strangulation: it's harder and harder to fight back when you're lagging meaning your decline rate will increase.

A savage war game that plays brilliantly.  One of the few that's actually better with more players - fill all the slots and prepare for a brutal blood bath of war, negoatiations, and betrayal.

Auctioning, tile-laying, set collection, negotiation, economic game with a dry but solid theme.

The game plays 3-5 players, but apparently works best with just 5 (the only number I've played with), and lasts 9-11 rounds depending on the number of players.  Each round there are seven repeating phases.  There is the bidding for turn order, which is fairly innovative in this game as you can bid any amount rather than having to increase your bid and sometimes you want to be last rather than first.  The person with the lowest bid becomes the canal overseer, who has the weakest tile draw, but the most influence over which tiles will be "watered", and this is one of the few means of making income, with income being the name of the game- most money at the end of the game wins.  The bidding to begin with is to obtain tiles which will be placed generally in such a way as to make large areas of the same type of tile, which will generate income at the end of the game, ASSUMING the tiles are irrigated.  This leads to some real negotiation on the bribing of the canal overseer stage, as the overseer determines where the water will flow.  

Money is quite tight, even though there are small payouts at the end of each round.  Basically you will score points (money) by: being frugal with your starting capital, accepting bribes as the overseer, and having good tile placements at the end of the game.

This game works exceptionally well with 5, and would rate much higher except for the scalability issues (doesn't play 2, apparently not as strong with less than 5).

Santiago employs an unusual single-round auction mechanic, where you bid in turn order, but the only stipulation on the bid is that it's not the same as others... so it could be lower or higher than previous bids. This determines turn order (highest bid) and special privilege (lowest bid).

The game is okay, and presents some interesting decisions, but this will require several plays before being able to say whether I really like it or not. It doesn't talk to me much, but I didn't find the game play at all unbearable.

Not a bad game, by any means.

Santiago is a vicious little game. The screwage is high in this one, and it works really well for what it is. It's unfortunate that it only works really well with five... that factor alone will keep me from purchasing it. However, I'm happy to play it at any time.

A dry Euro-game with a pasted-on theme. But I'm a big fan of dry Euros so this was a fun game for me! It is, in the loosest sense, a game of agriculture, but the gameplay is essentially abstract. Auctions are always fun; this game features two variants of the genre - bidding and bribing. These phases really bring the game to life.

I usually like bidding games like Santiago, and I admit that the first 30 minutes were fun. But when the exercise of valuing the tiles at the market continued and continued without any obvious dramatic arc the game started to feel tedious and unrewarding. Basically the problem was the same as with Lords of Waterdeep, i.e., the very first thing you accomplish in the game may well be the biggest one. Then you spend the rest of the time gathering whatever odd points you can without any sense of achieving anything big. I missed the midgame development towards fierce fighting and bloodthirsty action in the end. Somehow the experience just fell flat. I reckon, Santiago could be ok if the game was substantially shorter, say, about a third.

Bid and bribe and be selfish! One of the best five player games out here. Underrated on BGG. Analysis paralysis muy occur, but that does not ruin the gameplay. Recommended.

My first impressions of this are very good.  There is quite a lot of game for a small price and about 50 mins.  Certainly there are elements of other games in it - various tile placement games, Acquire and a bribery method that I'm sure I've seen somewhere before but don't recall where.  It is a bit of brain-burner in the middle and end game, but it's not the sort of thing that should require anyone to suffer analysis-paralysis - if it is, then they need to speed up, because this isn't a heavy game, just a thoughtful one.  Lots of fun, and pretty elegant.

From the Reviews: I think this would be a great game to play and I hope I get to try it before I decided if I want to buy this game. It looks fun and with lots of good interation. I have to admit the title of the game never caught my attention until there was a Tanga deal, but after reading about the unique bidding and the player interaction this game looks like it could become lots of fun. I am always a little leary of buying a game that is great with 5 players, I worry that I can't get enough people to the table

RATING: 6
The player incentives make this a plus but the random nature of tiles can force your hand to create poor selections while others get what they need at the right times, with ruthless players, there is a lot of destroyed crops and so getting power at the right times can be crucial, game breaking probably not but this sort of attitude puts me off games.

Open crop tiles. Bid for crop. Pick and place the crop on board with worker markers. Bribe the waterman (lowest bidder) to water the crop. Crop without water, loses a worker. Dried crop (without anymore marker) are turned to dessert. Distribute cash. Repeat for 9-11 rounds.

Sounds easy? Never expected the game to involve so much thinking and maths. Because similar crops adjacent to each other score big. End of game, player gets crops multiply by player's workers. And that's the amount of cash player will get.

Ain't good game to play with kids due to the bribing element in it. The waterman is powerful as 'the water flows where the money goes'.

RATING: 7.5
Players are farmers in the game who are trying to farm crops and get the highest yield (which can be converted into money) in the game.  In the game, there are types of crops namely, Pea, Chilli, Potato, Banana and Eggplant. 

Each game turn is played in this way, crops are laid in piles and the first crop of each pile is shown to everyone.  Everyone will has the chance (starting from the player left of the canal builder) to bid. The highest bidder will get to choose crops first followed by next bidder (the lowest bidder or the first one to pass a bid will be the Canal Overseer).  After all players have chosen their crops, players place their crops onto the field as well as the number of workers (yield) onto the crop tile.  

However all crops needs to be irrigated and it is only through building canals, water can flow from the water dam to the crops.  All players can propose a canal to be built and bribe the Canal Overseer to build the canal they proposed, but it is up to the Canal Overseer to decide which bribe to take or not at all.  Every player will have 1 emergency canal which can be use in case of emergency.  If crops are not irrigated, the yield will drop and if no yield blocks are on the crop tile, they might become a desert in the next turn.

After all crops are planted, points (money) are counted.  More points are scored if each crop tile has more yield and they are connected to other crops of the same type.  The person with the most money wins the game.

Good points: The game has easy rules and therefore easy to learn.  An interesting game which needs players to weigh the opportunity costs of every move.  Though the base rules are easy, the game requires much strategy and thinking which makes the game interesting and fun.  A game that should be introduced to starting gamers.

Bad points: A game which I think does not have much bad points.

The rules are pretty simple, and the mechanics are easy to explain, but there's a good bit of strategy here.  You have to resist the temptation to simply expand the existing fields to "jump on the bandwagon." Sure, you may be earning good points, but you're probably giving more to other players at the same time.

RATING: 7
Pros
- Fun mechanic of bidding money for turn order
- Tile laying is interesting and creates alliances
- Laying water routes and getting water to crops is a fun puzzle 
- Bribing overseer is fun
- A fair amount of direct conflict, shifting alliances, and betrayal
- Pretty looking board when done
- Plays in about an hour which is great
- The insert is excellent 

Cons
- Boring looking box cover with a guy that looks bored 
- It's about farming and irrigation...
- Should only be played with 5 so it doesn't scale at all

Sold/Traded because: 
- It's hard to get exactly 5 players together
- The theme was not approved by the group
- It gets a little math-y at the end with the calculations
- Fun mechanics could not overcome the theme

It's a pretty simple rule set, but a lot of really interesting things here.

The final scoring is a bit calculating, though I like that it still makes money accumulated during the game meaningful. Also, it's got a nice "frenemy" dynamic in which you'll want to block others out of merging into your plantation but then, once they've snaked in, you'll both be alternately defending the plantation and, potentially, trying to kick them out.

It feels the game can feel like it's decided early because, once a tile is "safe", it's permanently safe and you can see some pretty large safe plantations.

With five, there is indeed lots of good screwage and I can absolutely get how the game get much less interesting if you even drop one player. With five, barring a really premature emergency irrigation, somebody's going dry.

The canal overseer's got a really interesting position in that yes, you want to cash in your position of power for the most cash you can but yes, you also screw over your opponents (who are all pitching in to the most lucrative offer) and especially the largest plantation. And then another person can lowball an offer for a canal that will screw over all the others and so the overseer has to determine if it's worth taking this lowball or not.

Great negotiation dynamics. I do wish there were maybe just a touch more meat to the rest of it (tile-laying / scoring).

Played this for the first time with 5 players, and I was pretty impressed with how such a simple game with such simple mechanics can create such a fun experience. Good interesting decisions, and thematically well integrated. Perhaps the game needs 5 to be fun and create the necessary tension and conflicts?  If so, that might limit the ability to get Santiago out to the table.  Still, if you have 5 and want to play something that features a lot of good player interactions and negotiations, with a relatively short playing time, Santiago seemed quite worthy, and even original in certain respects. 

Second game with 5, pretty good again.

{1 play, 5 players} Well, I must say, I don't see it.  It was interesting, and maybe future play will help upgrade my opinion, but if everyone's on their game doing their best to "balance" things out, it seems like the player who gets the lucky tile flip will win - especially if they're last to bid.  Again, maybe our game was atypical, but bidding a lot for a tile and then being outbid by another player (or two) seems unrecoverable.

[original rating: 5.5] Over a year later before my second play - this time four-player - and my opinion has gone up.  Part of that, of course, is having one fewer player, which gave you more control in the bidding, yet, surprisingly, did not make tile placement any easier.  But mostly experience (and different players, maybe) kept the bidding "reasonable" so that even if you ended up with the "bad" tile, it didn't cost you too much.  Seems like you'd have to play with LOTS of table talk, though, and that may turn some off.

i tried this with 3 and it wasn't my thing.  that was a long time ago, and i've heard that 5 is the only way to fly.  well i tried it with a very fun group, and it still fell flat for me.  i see a choice between keeping a running score and turning it into a leader-bashing game or kicking up the AP and doing on the spot calculations, but i don't like either option.  ultimately i fault the game for being too tactical, with little ability for long term planning aside from the obvious direction of water paths and remaining tile counts.  seeing the next batch of tiles might help this, but wouldn't it just be an AP puzzle at that point?  i don't see how it can be saved from itself for my tastes.

An area control game that depends on an auction mechanism for area growth.  The auction mechanism works well as does the tile placement.  The canal placement rules are dependent on 'negotiation'.  Some may view this as chaotic or too random, but proper planning your tile placements based on the other players and especially the canal player will determine the sucess more than any 'negotiation'.  A solid design that flys just under most radars.  Worth playing.  [GTI Code: TGSD]

A great game with very simple rules, so new players can learn it in 5 minutes. Yet, all the auctioning, negotiating and clever tile placement make this a true gem, suited for everyone.

It's a little bit backstab-ey, though (and this is the reason why I haven't bought it for my group). Plus, it really shines with 4 or 5, but with 3 is rather dull, and it's unplayable with 2.

Santiago is an entry-level game that is also interesting enough to play with gamers.  I usually dislike negotiation games, but I find that the negotiating in Santiago is faster to do and therefore, more fun.  The main downside to Santiago is that the randomness of the tiles makes it much less of a strategy game and more of a luck-of-the-draw game.  I couldn't imagine playing this with less than 5 players.

A good game that doesn't get it's due love due to a less than exciting theme. Irrigation!, oh wow, let's play that! Ya, that doesn't happen. But, if given the chance, the mechanics of this game can win you over. Try before you buy, but definitely try it.

Solid, solid game.

What I liked is that this has those elements of trying to outguess your opponents, strategically, almost in a citadels-like way.

That said, it's also one of those games where you hear, "this feels like work".  Not that book-keeping was especially hard or anything, it's just a game of pretty hard decisions and not a lot of discovery.

Rules-wise, it did have a lot of unfortunate exceptions I had to explain to people as we went, which sucked.  "oh, and...  and...  and...".

This was a present for Christmas 2009 from a good friend of mine.

If you could describe this game in a single word, that word would be 'rough'. The game has a large 'take that' element, both in the auctions and the placement of the canals. That being said the game is great fun to play unless you are being actively picked on by your opponents, in which case you are little more than a spectator in short order.

Basically another abstract with a pasted on theme. Still it makes some sence at least. Game mechanics work together in an interesting way. Nothing really innovative here. After one play there seems to be a runaway leader problem. If you're behind there is very little you can do to catch up. Not the game I was hoping for and expecting after reading the reviews.

Got this to the table a second time. Because it was more apparant what were good and bad moves, the game seemed more balanced. And thus there were lot's of options for tactical manoeuvering and sneaky withdrawls. Seems I might like this game after all. Will give it some more time to prove itself.

This game can be super fun, but if you make a mistake or get screwed by your fellow players early it can become quite frutstrating.

I really enjoyed the first and only game I played of this.  I hear that it requires 4-5 to really be good.  Sadly, I usually game with 2 at a time, so the odds of this getting played again soon is not good.  I do have Aquadukt, which is a similar concept for 2-4 players and that works pretty well.

First play was good (with 4 players).  It does require the right crowd as everyone is bound to make a play that upsets others.  Second play was better (with 5 players).  One experienced player kicked the rest of us around, but it was a lot of fun and I love the decisions and "negotiating" that occurs in this game.  Third play was also very good (4 players)... this time I finished second to the experienced player by 1 escudo.  It was tight.  Fourth play was good (5 players)... the game is especially good with 5 players.  Thank you secret santa 2008!

I really love this game with 5 gamers.

This is one of the best auction games I've ever played: water is tight; bribe the overseer! Great with 4 players, even better with a full 5.

Have only played on SBW and it was a bit dry - player interaction suffered due to play by email interface.

This could be good in person.  I expect the bidding/negotiation for canal placement to be fierce - this was lost in the online experience.

From what I can see, its best with 5 players.  Not enough tension in 3 or 4p.

After reading some people claim that it's only excellent with five players (and it is excellent at that number), I was nervous leading up to my first game with four.

What a wickedly nasty game this can be.  I like how this one comes together with the bidding for the tile, trying to place it to keep it irrigated without having to pay and arm and a leg (or use your extra canal when you don't want to).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The randomness (or lack of) in crop tiles often makes or breaks the game.  Turn order is quite important; it's often bad to be on the left of Santiago because that makes you 1st bidder in the once-around auction.  Seems important to block the high point fields to keep the game balanced.  Paying a consistent mid-range dollar amount for auctions is bad... you'll also need to pay for watering... and likely you'll run out of money.  In almost every game there's a time when I wish that I had provided an alternate water route for $1.  Don't save your emergency water until too late in the game (especially the 9-round 5-player game)... because you might not be able to play it at all!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After our first play, all 5 players (none of whom had played before) were ready to play again immediately, and one of the group ordered the game that evening. This is an easy game to teach and learn. The mechanics are simple, but the possible depth of strategy becomes apparent as you play the game. Great amount of interaction. Plenty of agonizing decisions, but not so many that your brain burns out by the end. Highly recommended. Additional note after more plays: not as interesting with three players, (best with four or five) but this doesn't change my overall opinion about the game. It's still one of my favourites.

A good fun tile laying co-operative/screw your neighbour auction game!

You have to draw a fine line between working with someone to your mutual advantage and letting them do better out of the deal then you do. Auctioning for tiles, determining where canals get placed to irrigate your tiles, the threat of desertification and so on, it's great!

I feel I should like this much more than I do :( It has confrontation and bidding - both of which I like. I expected it to have a strategic feel but the randomness overwhelms, as the plantations are only flipped up at the start of the round you can't plan ahead very far. You want to plan ahead as the main way to win is to be in the right fields at the right time - but this is dictated by the order in which the tiles come up, which is completely random. Overall a game I'll play if someone else wants to but have no desire to own.

This is one of my favorite games from the past 12 months or so (March 2007 right now). This game shines with 5 players (I have never tried it with less).

Rating is somewhere between a 7 and an 8. It is very elegant. With a simple ruleset, it's a combination of auction and area control but with a lot of shared incentives and negotiation. The only reason I'm not sure if it's an 8 is because the game felt a little long with 4. I suspect 5 would be ideal (since there are 2 fewer rounds).

Have now played with 5 bastards and this game absolutely deserves its rating of 8.  Possibly will bump the rating up if it gets more plays.

Another game that started high on my list but has faded.  Gets a little repetitive. Turn order can be a factor, which is primarily influenced by who gets the canal overseer.  Since some rounds are more key than others, one may be unable to be effective as a high(er) bid is just a waste of money.  These type of turns affects how I view the game.

An elegant game with simple to learn rules that has good strategic elements and player interaction. Even non gamer friends enjoy this one. A real hit with my casual gaming group.

A fun game. Very group dependent. Negotiations may be minimal or involved. Lots of screwage. Not a lot of control to the end results.

The box cover and the name of the game did not do much to me. Boring name and even worse choice of box art. I did not take a second look.

However, when a friend mentioned 'Santiago' and 'vicious' in the same sentence, I was intrigued. He said Santiago is more vicious than 'Intrige'. That did it. I checked out BGG and Boardgames With Scott. Bought it promptly and played it.

This is one simple vicious filler.

* Like:  fun theme, unique auction mechanism, great graphics, lots of computations--but easy math.  

The DEAL BREAKER:  almost every round someone gets screwed (usually me)!  Won't get much table time because of the screwage factor.  Would be an 8 but a low score because of screwage factor.

I know it's just a game but don't like "screw your neighbor" mechanism.

Played with five it gets nasty fast as there is no way everyone is getting irrigated from the first turn It's a game about evaluating the value of land and where you are in the turn order. There is nothing worse than paying a lot for something that is worthless.

What keeps the game from greatness is the potential for a game that continues even though the winner has already been mathematically determined and an overly calculable ending in general.

What an underrated game. Simple ruleset, great playtime, loads of player interaction... and sweet, sweet screwage. [i]Oh[/i]... the screwage.

The auction system has you essentially bidding for two things at the same time, so each turn you have to decide whether to bid high or low. It makes for some juicy, angsty choices. And it's part of the reason everyone has a vested interest in every auction which is something I always appreciate.

Tensions run pretty high in this game as you're constantly at the mercy of one player (or you ARE the player in control of everyone's destiny, and you get to take advantage of everyone else's desperation). The bribery phase is pure gold - this is where much of the nastiness that makes this game so special comes in. I'd say it's the thing that takes the game from being a pretty straightforward affair and elevates it to the plateau of true greatness... but in truth that's only part of it. There is something much more important in this game...

I've heard the complaint that Santiago is too mathy, as everyone's scores are fully calcuable at any point if you take the time to do so. That IS true, but there's one thing that prevents this game from devolving into dry, dusty mathland and it's something I think a lot of people miss: you are open to negotiate AT ANY TIME. If you are not constantly making deals then you are playing this game wrong and missing out on all of the fun. ALL OF IT! Treat this game like a negotiation game and it shines brighter than the Pink Panther diamond... ignore negotiation and it will turn to ash.

And on a final note, while the theme isn't the sort of thing that's likely to excite anyone it actually fits the mechanics pretty well, and the game is pretty attractive to boot. That's worth a little something, I think.

I was pleasantly surprised by this game! It doesn't look like much, but the gameplay - though pretty simple - is great! I liked everything about the game and I think it's pretty unique the way to bid for the plantations and bribe the overseer - who might even take a lower bid just to screw you, which means that there is a fair amount of nastiness in this game, something I love! The negotiations when trying to bribe the canal overseer is funny and it's a cool mechanic that you can support other players' bids. 
I like it a lot even with 4, but 5 is probably better I think. Wouldn't play it with 3 as the whole bartering and bribing IS the game, and for that to shine, the game needs as many players as possible.

Rated 9 after first play with five players. Wow. Did not expect that! I bought the game after reading the rules, and I knew it was something I'd like. But actually playing this game surprised me with how much I enjoyed it. And I came in last place.

Santiago is quick, tense, and nasty. Three solid traits if you ask me. The bidding is tough and subtle, with the obvious advantage of picking tiles first, but some benefits to bowing out early and becoming the canal overseer. But besides the bidding, there's a spacial element. You have to make sure people don't cut off the chance for you to grow plantations that you've invested in.

The game isn't much to look at, with a flat brown grid of a board, wood cubes, tiles, and paper money. But man I loved how the game played, and I instantly want to try it again.

Update: 2nd play, this time with four players. The four player game was less tense. It seemed easier to get the canal to your plantations. Is this because of the two extra turns and canals? I'm not sure, but I suspect four players is less tense, and thus less cutthroat. Unless other plays prove me wrong, this is a 9 with five, and an 8 with four.

Update: another play, and it's a shame it's taken me so long to get this to the table again. I love this game. Easy enough for light gamers, enough substance for "serious" gamers... it has a great deal of interaction between players, the mechanics are straightfoward... about the only knock on this game is the 4 or 5 player count, and I can hardly fault it for that.

Great game. You must decide on what to do heavily depending on what others have done so far. And, for your moves to succeed at the end, you also need to play the other player's game, or else you'll end up (your plantations, that is) abandoned in a lone corner without irrigation. It's all about resources administration and observing the current scenario to best plan your actions.

I loved this one reading the rules. I think I was turned on to it by a reviewer who wrote something along the lines that 'the rules are simple and let the players play the game.' But he said it better. Anyway, its true, this game has player interaction, social interaction, screwage, it plays quickly for its depth, so much to like.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It has all the right bits: auctions, screwage, tile placement and yet none of it intersects in an interesting manner.  The auctions are shallow, the screwage more of a mix of gang vs gang and a popularity brigade, and the tile placement values are so dominated by the screwage (to get water) that the interest level is drained.

RATING: 8.5
Incredibly tactical game, with loads of possibilities.  It will take many more plays before I understand the full scope of options in each move offered to the players.  Add in bluffing, negotiation, and bribing on top of that, and the game seems endlessly replayable.  Love it.

After one playing: a fine enough game, but not especially compelling.  Bribing the overseer is kind of a neat mechanism.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun, smart, medium-weight game popular with my friends.  It's colorful too. We sometimes play with a funny gardening hat, which we jokingly require the irrigation overseer to wear. Sometimes my friends and I really play-up the overseer personality and bribing. Given all the other games to play, I do not want to play it that often. Still, every time I've played it I've had a good time. [update, traded]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A gamer's game.  The mechanism of bribing the overseer to place a canal is brilliant and brutal.  The game's biggest weakness in my eyes is that it so strongly rewards detailed calculation of everybodys' scores at all times, which is more work than I want to put into it--not because I'm opposed to calculation in a game but because the calculation itself is rather long and tedious.  Some kind of score track might help. (Needs more than 3 players for the bribing to work well.)

Negotiation and Palm Tree Variants

I kept vacillating with this title...I looked at the components and it looked rather boring, then I looked at my Geek Buddies' ratings and I was excited again. Back and forth. Then I had a chance to play it: interesting. Nothing new, but it blends many familiar mechanics in interesting ways. Lots of confrontation, a decent auction mechanic (which reminded me of El Grande in a way), some negotiation possibilities, and some randomness to keep things variable. 

This is a solid title, light negotiation, light screwage, some mathy calculations. I played it with 5 though, and I think given the math behind canal placement and such that playing with less would make the system more fragile (i.e.: susceptible to poor play making the game play suffer) because it would be too easy for people to start being agreeable all the time instead of cutthroat. As it was in the 5 man game there were many situations that came up where no one was willing to bribe the canal digger because there was enough irrigation to make the people who *really* needed their tiles watered to be safe, and perhaps spend their "freebie" if the situation was really dire. The problem is that each fresh canal irrigates up to 4 plantations, so with 4 people, or worse yet, 3 at the table you would have very little forced jockeying for position. The game doesn't seem as though it would be terrible because people could still voluntarily play nastily to hurt their opponents (which you would pretty much have to do to win) or just start the irrigation off in the corner of the board to insure several of the canals are only irrigating 2 tiles instead of 4, but I still don't think I would ever sit down with less than 5 to this. 

The randomness though...it is what took this game down from a home in the 6-7 range. Because the random plantations are only flipped up at the start of the round you can't plan ahead very far, and the order in which the little buggers come up is rather critical because of the way the values multiply based on the size of the groupings. Really the only blemish I can find on this game, but enough to knock it down from an 8, to a 6, to its present locale of 4. When I first played this game the other aspects of it interested me enough to make the tile flip acceptable, but in my most recent play I have really become blah about the title as a result. You really cannot plan ahead, and the major consideration involved in winning this title is getting into the right fields at the right time, almost all of which is dictated by the order in which the tiles come up, which is completely random. I suppose this issue could be fixed by placing tile futures face up at least one round in advance, but that would have a side effect of increasing the length of the game, and this game really wants to stay within that hour time frame.

Ultimately, of my 4's, this is one of the ones that I am more willing to play just because of the length, but I do think of this game as a disappointment because it seemed to have some promise. There is potential depth here within the system, but the random tile element just destroys it and makes this game feel very conflicted to me.

Excellent cuthroat game. There are two bidding rounds both of which can offer some tough decisions and opportunities to mess with your opponents. You also have to decide which tiles to take and where to place them. You can really put the squeeze on the canal builder when you know he wants to go one direction by placing a suggestion with a large sum of money on it in another direction. Thus forcing him to pay to go the way he wants.

Great game. The player who didn't bid very high each round and often took the water carrier (and who no one thought was a threat) won the game. Don't underestimate the power of 3 money per round, people bribing you and then still managing to get a couple of goods plays onto the board.

RATING: 8
It is genuinely too bad that this game only genuinely works with a lot of players. It is a relatively simple game: bid on crop farms, put them down to form adjacent areas, and bribe a continuously changing overseer to water your crops. With 3 players, there is way too much room for everuone, ruining the subtle balance between bidding, bribing and group thought. The game becomes much better with 4, and is great with 5. 

At first I was rather hesitant in buying this title because I did not know how well it would play with 4. But it does an admirable job. I like Santiago's zany charm with very subtle powerplays and not-so-easy decisions on when to become overseer and when to make a killer move without helping the others too much, and so forth. In fact, I'm actually quite impressed that such an apparently simple game just seems to work so very well without feeling artificial. With my sweetheart liking this too, this was a purchase we can both look back on with satisfaction, and the prospect of many hours' worth of play in which we silently curse each other's sneaky behaviour.

The money goes where the water flows - I think you do better by going for smaller plantations and being sure of water rather than going for the largest possible plantations. Playing with 5 is much more challenging than playing with 4 or less as there will be a shortage of water no matter what. Careful planning and purchasing are crucial.

Many of the pieces of this game strike me as very clever, and I do enjoy playing, but the whole doesn't click for me as much as some other games do. [Edit 2017-01: With 5 players, it seems to click better. I suspect 3-4p was just too much abundance.]

For people that love a bidding mechanic are drawn to more social games, Santiago performs very well.

Your turn consists of planting crops and then (hopefully) watering said crops.  Boring, right?

Not. At.  All.

The seemingly simple and dry (har har) game earns its stripes via auctions and bribes.  As the canal overseer, you always have the choice to screw over your fellow players--it may cost you in order to do it, but it can be done.  Or you can do as the others wish, and line your pockets in the process.

Figuring out the true value of the money is what takes time (as in multiple games).  Understanding how much to bid--or bribe--will only come with experience.

Man, I'm really diggin' these treats. 

Clocking in at about an hour, Santiago packs a lot of crunch in a little package.  A dynamic area control mechanism, a tough bidding system, understated, tense negotiation, and plenty of opportunity for player interaction and screwage are combined in a fresh and innovative game that scratches just the right itch.

Topping it all off, Santiago scales well from 3 to 5 with clever placement of the Spring and Palm Trees, and even scales well to group dynamics, with as much cooperation or screwage as your group is comfortable with!

Santiago is a real gem which belongs in any collection and has certainly earned a place in my Top Ten.

Santiago is another in a long line of games that I have been introduced to that, while there was nothing actively wrong with it, still seemed to lack the specific x-factor that makes a game fun and captivating to me. The auctions had context, the ability to negotiate and exchange money seemed to be a reasonable mechanic as did the potential for regions to get dried out without access to the canals. But overall, it just did not work for me. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Players bid to take a type of crops and drop one or two workers on it.  The crop is placed on the board.  At the end of the game the crops pay out the product of workers and how many similar crops are in the "cluster".  However, crops have to be irrigated, and the canal digger (the lowest bidder in the auction) has the final say in the canal path.  Plays very quickly and offers up a nice decision or two.  Could be rather cutthroat for the friendly, happy gamers out there.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
On the one hand, there's quite a bit to like here. There's great bidding and placement rules. The way that the lowest bidder is compensated by being assigned the role of ditchdigger is a clever way to compensate those low on cash. And the bribery rules are worthy of Intrige. 
 
But there's a downside for me is the lack of long-term strategy and unique paths to victory. Everyone is staring at the same board and calculating the scores, with no hidden info and no look-ahead. The lack of long-term-thinking hurts my opinion of this one. I want to try it with four to see if it loosens the game up a bit. 
 
Was surprised that this was not made by Colovini, a designer who typically makes games with this much tactical calculation and rarely uses hidden information.

Long time to get to the table, I have the polish edition. This is perhaps my favourite auction game, it's interactive and mean with simple rules. The components in this newer edition are lovely. That score track is an abomination however! Played at the five player count, which I imagine is best. Needs repeat plays, though I imagine rating will go up.

Repeated plays have elevated this, simple, interactive, economic, mean in parts. It reminds me of a meaner simpler power grid. It's excellent.

The paper money SUCKS in this game almost as much as Power Grid. Use poker chips or coins.

It really is best with 5 players. However, it still doesn't grab me. Interesting things going on, but I just don't care to think as hard about a game like this as I have to in order to be competitive. I find it hard to focus during the latter half of the game. Vinci leaves me feeling the same way.

Interesting auctions and negotiations drive this game.  Tough choices on every turn.  This game can have some real gotcha/take that moments.  The fact that unwatered tiles dry up completely in the final round, not just lose a step, can really hit hard.  Just when you think you have the game in hand it can bite you right in the can.  Great Fun!

UPDATE: This has become a favorite of our group. It really is a fantastic game with 5 players. Bumping up to a "9".

This game can be pretty brutal with it's direct confrontation, but played with the right group it can be very enjoyable. Fortunately, I've had nothing but great experiences with this one. I love the bidding and the bribing. Great game.

[b]7.6.12 Update:[/b] This game is still really clicking. Everyone is enjoying it despite it's direct confrontation. Rating might have to move up soon.

[b]5.2.17 Update:[/b] Played this again recently and man is this a brutal game. Just painful. Some new players messed with the economy pretty bad, but that just made it a unique play. Still enjoyed it, but it was quite rough. Rating dips a little.

RATING: 7
Tile placing game - get points by multiplying number of buildings you have in a color crop, by the number of connected tiles of that color crop there are. A lot of strategy involving whether it benefits you more to hurt the other players - especially since often everyone is trying to cash in on the same crop. Biggest factor to be successful? Holding onto the one free aqueduct piece you get in the beginning of the game

RATING: 6
Santiago is a tile laying game. it has a terrific bidding system for acquiring the tiles, and a terrific bribing mechanism for laying the irrigation channels required to make the tiles score. But it is also ultimately a fairly dry and abstract tile laying, area majority game. 

we played with 5 and I think it requires that number.  the mechanisms are so tense and allow much nasty screwage to undermine your opponents, by bribing the controller of irrigation channels to divert water away from their crops.

I have played Santiago a few times lately. I enjoyed Santiago quite a bit. 

I bought Santiago after my first game played. I played with my own copy of Santiago a few times already and am happy of having Santiago in my game collection along with my other auction/bidding games. Auction games is one of my favorite game mechanics.

The way how the crops are scored in the game is interesting. Bidding for first choice of crop can be expensive at times. Crops can dry up if your not generous enough to the pedro. Being the pedro is the only way of earning money in the game besides of getting the 3 dollars every turn. Santiago can have some nice twist and turns on how the players bid. It can easily screw up a player's game.

*UPDATE I*
I bought the game twice and traded it twice. Looking into getting a copy in my game collection.

*UPDATE II*
Got another copy. This one still in shrink.
8 plays since recording games played.

RATING: 6
A nice, light negotiation game. I don't think there was nearly enough screwage in the one game I played. The order in which tiles comes out seems like it may be very important - if a bunch of potato comes out early, a large potato plantation is much more likely than if it's spread out. That means that since different people invest in different things at the start, some of them will get screwed by the tile ordering.

A decent game with group interaction, but the fun factor on this one is very low. I rarely replayed this game and when our group put it on the table, it was never a memorable experience.

For being an older Euro classic, I'm surprised it took me this many years to finally sit at a table to play it. It was a well executed auction game, albeit a bit dry, mixed with a territory control element (which is not my favorite mechanic) that work well together.

The ability to bid up the placement of the water road each round is cool, but more often than not, it felt a tad irrelevant if the one who gets to place it is has little reason to accept the bribes on placement.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Visually appealing game, but lacking in interesting strategy decisions. Auction/bribe mechanic adds some interest, so if you like auction or negotiation games, add one to my rating. The short-term value of most options is easily calculable, while the long-term value is indeterminate, making anything other than tactical play impossible.  We found the game mildly interesting, but not compelling enough to bring it to the table over other games that we prefer. Rating is a composite of my rating, my wife's rating, and my sister's rating (all 5's),
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Really nice assimilation of mechanics (area control, bribery, bidding, cooperation).  Playing with 5 is best in that canals become much more valuable to players needing to water their plantations.  The one negative is tracking scores during the game- a lack of a scoring track makes it a challenge to gauge who's in the lead but having one would slow the game to a crawl.

It's no secret I like auction games, and this game is nothing more than a series of auctions. First, there's a strange once-around auction for drafting different cards, but instead of necessarily high-bidding you're bidding different amounts which may be higher or lower, or may be just to pass. Right after drafting and placing, there's another auction. This is another queer auction, since the auctioneer chooses which bid is actually highest. The game has a little in common with it's older relative, Medici. But unlike Medici, there's some interest in set collection between players. Like Medici, it's a game that can be ruined by some improper bidding. Overall, it's a unique game experience that is worth checking out, especially at 5 players.

Enjoyable combination of an auction mechanic and semi-collaborative onboard play. I would call this Power Grid light, and in this case "light" is an advantage.  It provides a lot of interest for something on par with Settlers in terms of play length and complexity.  It's really a perfect balance of strategy (money management and some on-board play) and negotiation (auctions and bribing).  

We have a lot of fun with this one, when we can get together 4 or 5.

RATING: 6.5
An unusual game in that it totally seems like an exemplary Euro, with its agricultural theme and muted cubes - yet plays more like a hybrid.  It's heavily analytical, but also heavily dependent on player interactions and growing and dissolving alliances.  It reminds me of a tighter, meaner Acquire and has a brutal bid phase reminiscent of AoS, but the pacing feels a little too quick and processional and the lack of hidden information removes intrigue and makes it too calculable.  Needs a dynamic play environment to shine, and I consider that a weakness.  

I came up with a theme variant for imagination-challenged FA:ATies that I'm quite proud of.  Play the board in space with the tiles representing parts of a growing space station and the irrigation lines representing air.  If you don't get an air line to your section of the station, your cubes - for the AT fans we'll represent them as......um.....sexy Elfen Zombie space nurses - die of asphyxiation.  For the rest of us, choking out another farmer's fields and watching his income disappear and children cry in hunger is more than enough to work with.  C'mon Cohaagen, give dese people air!

Initially seems to have a bit of a "dry" theme, but the great negotiation and logistical resource management quickly wins you over.  Definitely plays best with five players with lots of table talk and negotiation, but it is also good with four if you start with the spring on the edge of the board.  This game is all about the players and the interaction!  Not for everyone though!

[10/2009] The bribe system is interesting. At first, the waterman is not that powerful. In late game, however, it is the reverse. I am not able to figure out the EV of the bribe yet. It is similar along the line of the field path x workers / 2.

RATING: 8
I played and bought this at Essen for €18. I really enjoyed this simple auction/placement game. Tiles of different crops are offered, players bid to choose first etc. The first to pass becomes the canal builder. The tiles are then put on the plantation fields and 1 or 2 workers added. Then the players bribe the canal builder to lay an irrigation channel between the fields. If your tile is not adjacent to water, it turns to desert. Scoring is by multiplying connected crop tiles by the workers you have. So players co-operate to build *some* crops and keep them irrigated, and compete to block and wither other crops where they don't benefit. The auction is blindingly simple. Each round everyone gets $3 anyway, auction goes round once, each player may bid any but different amount. First to pass gets the builder. Typically we bid 3,2,1 but when one player *really* wanted control he bid 8, forcing the next to bid 6. At the end, all the fields are scored, paying to participating players and most money wins. Very simple, very quick, very neat. Not a deep game but good clean family fun. A must-buy game, probably a shade too ruthless for family play.

The game is different with 3 players, the highest bidder getting to place an extra tile, which can make a big difference
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
With 5 players, I place the water spring at the edge at startup (middle of the board is too easy and not enough tension).

With 4 players, I place it at the corner.

With 3 players, I don't play this game at all.

I also strongly recommend exposing the next series of tiles in line as a "sneak peak" to what is coming NEXT round.  Otherwise, the tile investment can become way too random.

With these changes, it elevates the game from a "7" game to an "8" game.

I like this game a lot.  It's a mathy game with lots of fun game elements.  You should have someone who is quick with multiplication for easy scoring.  It doesn't take too long, but you need to encourage everyone to keep up the pace.  Plus the colors are nice.  First couple times playing, I missed the rule that if you pass on bidding, then you subtract one crop worker on your chosen tile.

Played 1 time. Honestly, my first playing, I just wasn't in the mood for this, especially because I didn't know it was a gamer game -- I thought it would be a lot lighter. Reminiscent of Modern Art in some ways in that acquiring properties and getting them irrigated is important, but just as important is being the one who holds the power to irrigate them, so one can acquire money either way. For me, far too much calculation is required to do well for me to enjoy this game as pure fun. It is a brain-burner, which is good for some, and usually good for me, but I don't like games where I have to continually calculate to do well -- so this one will never be a huge hit for me.

Interesting bidding with lots of opportunities to screw and/or extort your neighbor.  Where to plant the fields and which to bid requires some planning but the real fun is to be had with the irrigation digger.  A very interactive game which slowly builds itself into a plantation.  Being part of the big field is not the only road to riches; try to spread around and join several fields.  Though spending is easy, be careful to remember that money in hand counts at the end.

Update: Up for trade, it's the open scoring info and lack of hidden information that drys up the game, not the water problem.

I've played it twice with five players each time and so far I really like it.  I'd like to play this one again soon. We did have a few dud turns where there were no conflicts and where to put the water wasn't an issue.  I think it needs five players to make it tight and the paper money is hard to work with.

Auctions + negotiation + bribing - what's not to like?! Seriously underrated game. 

Mechanics are simple, but decisions are not. You constantly have to evaluate how much things are worth to you and also try to anticipate what other people are going to do - or how to manipulate them into doing what you want. 

As most decisions affect everyone, it is highly, highly interactive. There's so much table talk, it really feels like a co-op. But it's competitive! Games change drastically with the crowd so it's highly replayable. 

Most non-gamers can get this game very quickly. Next to Ra, this is my current favorite gateway.

There is a lot to like in Santiago. Play is brisk, with lots of hard decisions, temporary alliances and hard screwage. The only thing that detracts a little for the overall very good impression is that the importance of turn order overwhelms many other considerations. Then again the players can influence turn order so that might still be alright in isolation but since you don't know in advance when you want to be early or late in turn order it introduces a huge gambling aspect that doesn't really do the rest of the game justice.

Still a fine game, especially if you consider its age.

After first play - rated it a 7.
It is not a mediocre game, but not up there with E&T. Certainly a brainburner and has the potential to slow to a crawl if you have an analytical mathematician in the group. It can easily become a game of multiplication and analysis of point defferintial in the actions to be taken.
After 5 plays - an 8 rating. It is surprising. The more I play it, the more I realize how good it is. Yet, it is riding under the radar of most gamers.

Great game! This has a bit of negotiation to it, but it's really a super lean bidding game. The theme actually works rather well and the game play is easy. Each thought is tense however, and turns go quick, making this an excellent 5-player game. There's nothing really new in the game, but it has all the best uses of bidding and area control/influence mechanics. The game works best with 5 players. Still good with 4, but a lot less nasty- and the nasty is what makes this game frustratingly good!

Really inventive bidding game. The only one I know where it's sometimes good to LOOSE the bid and be the one to make some important decisions.

I didn't like the kind of interaction in this game - sometimes it can get really mean and nasty. Even more than in some wargames. That's why I sold it.

But if the negative interaction is not of an issue for you, you should definitely play Santiago. It's one of the very few original bidding games.

Ingenious economic game featuring auctions, cash management, tile placement, and a lot of overt politics in the form of tempting the other players with bribes.  There are a ton of subtly difficult decisions squeezed within a simple, snappy set of rules.  In order to accomplish anything significant, you have to spend victory points - magnifying the importance of your decisions.  This is one of my top choices for a group of five players, and while it's okay with four, it loses a lot of the tension because it's easier to irrigate your tiles.

When it came out, it did not get the attention that it deserved. It's an excellent game that constantly engages all players in a mix of tile auction and placement, bribes and money management. For maximum enjoyment, learn some simple rules of thumb as to how the addition of a plantation on the board will affect your and others' scores, or you'll risk getting stuck in mental loops when contemplating your decisions, or losing to more experienced players.

It seemed to play a lot like Oasis, except slower and with more negotiation.  A grid of tiles in the desert, multiplicative scoring (number of tiles times number of cubes on those tiles), and the sense that you have to help others to win, just don't help them too much.  I liked Oasis more, though.  My main complaint about Santiago is that it seemed kind of slow and drawn-out.  It was fine, but I don't know if I'd ever ask to play it again.

It's a little math heavy for my tastes, but the bidding for tiles and bribing for water are really neat mechanics. **UPDATE** Played this again, and the mathiness doesn't seem as bad. Nice interaction between players. With some AP players, it could become too mathy, but the game itself is fine.

Not so good, it doesn't get me but could be talked into it on occasion. That's what "4" tells and that is correct. 
First I have to mention - we played it with 3. So the bidding might be more interesting with 5. But with 3, being the first bidder can be a big disadvantage. This is imho anyways a problem for all bidding games with only 1 bidding round.
And furthermore - there is no real luck in this game. So it is a perfect nitpicker-game. I don't like such games.

Reminds me of Chinatown, because points = money, so you can calculate how much you should pay for plots of land based on the immediate value, but you also have to consider the potential future value if things go well in the next round(s).

Santiago is a game that is incredibly simple yet holds a lot rich interaction between players by combining auctions, tile-placement, and bribery set to the theme of a crooked irrigation and farming. Imagine a dirty cattle herder in Agricola, willing to open up a fence to let a few cattle stray into the neighbour's yard, for a price...

Each mechanical subs-structure is its own deliciously tender bite of agony: the auction only goes around once, and you can not bid the same value as another player; the tile placement phase might make that tile you just paid through the nose for not worth its weight in Escudos (the currency in the game); the bribery phase doesn't guarantee anything, nor is it always easy when you are the one receivign the bribes! Given that there are only 9 or 11 rounds in a game, every worker tending to and harvesting sugar cane, platanos, potatoes, beans, or peppers is serious business.

Simple yet tense game in which negotiation is not necessary, but (as the author states) not disallowed, and not unwelcome. Two thumbs up from me.

RATING: 8
(08/10/2010) The first few games were disturbing. This is a game about extortion, and screwing your neighbor(s) over water. The mechanics are novel, and the play is vicious, bringing out the worst in human nature. The smiling face on the box cover makes it seems like a friendly, family game, but it is not. I felt so "dirty" after playing this game, that I needed a shower. :-P  After three or so plays, if we approached it for what it is, it turned out to be a very good game, with a lot of tactical and strategic play. The bidding and bribing can be nearly optimized for there is almost no randomness, except for how the tiles come out. Newcomers should be warned that this is not a "let's play nice and sing kumbaya" sort of euro. If that is understood beforehand, I believe everyone can have a good time. Initial rating is a "7".

(12/07/2013) 5-plays: It's been three years to find the right opportunity and mix of players to bring this to the table. If everyone gives themselves permission to "be a dick", collude, backstab, betray, and basically play as ruthlessly as possible and not take it personally, this is a great game. It is an impressive design that is clean and minimal, yet with game mechanics that invoke theme, both visually and viscerally. Plenty of negotiation, table talk, temporary alliances, and plenty of [i]schadenfreude[/i] to go around--there is no finer pleasure than watching your neighbors' crops wither and their lands turn into dust. :devil: Upping to an "8" with the right crowd and right attitude.

A hugely enjoyable bidding and bribing game. Essentially you have a choice between bidding high in the auction and getting your plot 'auto-watered', or buying cheaply and then offering a bribe. It's all hugely mathematical, but you can lose a lot by bidding high and still being overbid, so reading your opponents is a useful skill. Like Chinatown there's little hidden information, so as the game progresses values become easy to calculate. Definitely on the heavier side of the Euro spectrum, but some chaos included.

First played July 10th, 2008. Taught in 10min, played in 1 hr with 4 players. This game has some luck and strategy in it with a take-that element with the canal overseer. Players start with $10 which are VPs at the end. Four stack sets of tiles are place near the board and the top tile is turned face up. Randomally select a canal overseer and the person to the left starts the bidding. Each player may bid(must be a different amount) or pass going around one time only. The lowest bid becomes the next canal overseer. If multiple players pass, the first to pass becomes the overseer. The highest bid turns in their bid to the bank and takes the tile and places it on the board and (may) meeples it with cubes equal to the people on the tile (1-2). Next the 2nd highest, 3rd, and last. Next the player to the left of the overseer bids on where to place the canal and places his canal stick in that location, followed by each other in clockwise order. Players may choose the same location as a previous player. The canal overseer may either take one of the bid locations and collects money, or bids higher and pays to the bank. Next each player to the left of the overseer may place their only canal segment, however only one can be played in a turn so the first played is it. Next The plantations that aren't irrigated lose one cube. If no cube is present, then the tile is turned to desert. Repeat for the following rounds. Scoring occurs when the last tiles are placed. Each tile connected orthogonally counts as a group. All cubes of your color are then multipled by the group tile count for a payout. 8 tiles * 5 cubes = $40. All areas are scored for each player. The most $ is the winner. I'd recommend this for those who like bidding games. I'd recommend it as a gameplay if you know someone who has it, otherwise I wouldn't purchase.

This one took awhile to get tried out.  And I'm not so sure it was worth the wait.  There's nothing offensive about it, but there's nothing great about it either.  In particular, many of the costs and benefits are way too calculable.  I much prefer the unknown assets of Traders of Genoa if I want a heavier trading game.  Altertnatively, I prefer the feel-good atmosphere of Bohnanza if I want a lighter negotiation game.  Basically, those two just squeeze out any space Santiago might occupy.

On it's own though, Santiago does have some good parts.  The turn structure keeps things reasonably quick moving without room for really long negotiations.  On the other hand, watching your crops turn to sand is a very painful experience.

Great "money is tight" auction game with some negotiation, and screw thy neighbour elements. Try to build the largest contiguous plantations of "irrigated" like crops to win the game. Excellent with 3 to 5 players. TOP#17

It doesn't shine, but it's a solid, interesting game, certainly worth playing.
Maybe sometimes you don't have a full control over your fate, but still there are varied and meaningful enough decisions to be made.
Constant mini-alliances are essential part of the game.

Overally - fine game, but I have so many more-than-fine games in my collection and no time to play them all that I have to cut Santiago out...

Sold.

RATING: 8
Well although nothing new this did feel unique enough for me and I think that was due to the bribery of the overseer which was arguably the best part of the game.  Has a good competitive auction with 5 players that worked very well with once around bidding and any amount possible except a previous bid (a little similiar to EG). 

Theme was there actually as people are trying to grow crops and irrigate them, I liked the penalty of no irrigation weakening the crop by one worker, if you lose your last worker you lose the land. A little screwage but not too heavy, you can block a crop from growing too big but it is an expected move really so nothing too nasty there. Money was very tight and this being your VP's you needed to try to be frugal while still getting what you want.  

The role of the overseer was an interesting one, lowest bidder takes it and gets last choice of the goods and placement but controls where the one irrigation strip was going. Sometimes goods could be close to equal which then made the role more desirable as this was the only way to grab cash besides the end of round fill-up. Some strategy on a per round basis only and more would have been nice (possible variant would be to always have the next round of tiles showing) but very nice tactics in the placements, bribery, and bidding which makes it a fun title.

Superficially similar to Chinatown and almost scratches the same itch with one big difference though, CT is all about negotiations where as here Bribery (you get to offer a one-time bribe) is the main aspect along with the auctioning so very different there.  Interaction, weight, game length, best with 5, and fun level are all about the same to me but I would happily own both as they are very different in execution.  

[u]UPDATE[/u]:7.5 => 7 Scaling issue stops this from hitting the table as often as it should, while I would play with 4, 5 would be best

[u]UPDATE[/u]: 7 => 8  I don't care if it is only good with 5 (probably 4 would be okay but 3 no good for sure) as it is excellent at the number, the once around unique bid auction is excellent and I love the bribery aspect and how two people can bribe together while the seer might not even take the bribe and just pay himself, excellent stuff along with the screwage

This feels a little similar to Oasis and little like New England, both of which I've since sold as this game does it much better. It can be somewhat cutthroat at times and it's very abstract. Overall, it's a good game but not great. I definitely had a "been there, done that" feeling. If you like New England and Oasis, you should like this too, but I'd recommend you try before you buy.

Elegant and *should be* quick to play. AP prone. Expect to be screwed and you can have a decent time with this. Good combination of planning your own moves with anticipating others', but everything's just a little too much out of your control.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (October 2010)

What a surprise game. I wasn’t expecting much due to its boring theme, however, Santiago is a mean negotiation game and I really like it. The game´s rules are pretty easy to grasp, however the game has more depth that I initially thought, lots of hard decisions. I say the game is mean, because it has a high screwage (and fun) factor :devil:. The theme does nothing for me, however the game mechanics (bidding, area control, negotiation, bribery) are great and flow seamlessly and quickly. Santiago is one of the best bidding games out there.

The game really shines with 5 players, with 4 it is a good game but it is easier to irrigate so it is not as fun.

On the bad side, I already wrote about the awful theme, the art is pretty regular too.

For now, I’m downgrading its rating, so it matches my feelings for the game with the BGG recommendation system, still Santiago is a game I want to play often and definitively I will buy it in the future.

Current Rating: 7.0

I have changed a lot these past years. Now I no longer care that much about the theme, but I do care about the game´s mechanisms so I have drifted away from most Ameritrash games and now I fully embrace the Eurogame trend.

Santiago’s theme no longer bothers me, and I continue to like the game. I hope to play it soon.

Bought it, but having trouble getting it on the table since there isn't really a viable 2P variant. In my infrequent multiple-player sessions I tend to want to pull out other things.
----------------------------
After 1 play: This was a surprise addition to a game day, and one which I hadn't read about at all. The play is quick, engaging, tense and competitive. Medium levels of interaction... play to cut each other off, make tacit deals for board space (but not explicit), make explicit deals by bribing the canal expansions. In the one game I played, the tendancy for everyone was to pay too much for everything so I won by basically bidding lowest ($1 or pass), accepting whatever tile was left over, and taking bribes on canal building. (I think it really shouldn't be possible to win without building a board presence.) I'd like to play this several times so that people get the sense of the value of the spaces, and the idea of two players tacitly conspiring to building mutually high scoring areas.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Delightfully nasty.  I'm a non-confrontational gamer, but I like this one, partly because the game's framework forces nastiness and it's hard to take personally.  Suffers a little because it can be hard for new players to see the best moves for given situations, but the fact this is a quasi-negotiation game mitigates that a bit.

Extra credit for being the source of the most pointlessly and hilariously vicious move I've ever seen in a game, a first turn screw-job extra canal placement where one player decided to trash another player's game without benefit to himself and with no apparent grudge to be settled.  Fortunately the move wasn't targeted at me.  Well done Nate, well done.

Simple but clever game which I really liked from my first play.  A bit of luck in what tiles show up compared to where you are at that time in the bidding order.  i.e. sometimes its best to be bidding late and others its good to bid first so as to pass and get control of irrigation.

A deceptively deep game, with critical cost-benefit decisions that are not obvious at first sight.

I enjoyed my one play (so far) immensely, and will be ready to play again soon.  

Update:  After a number of plays, I'm lowering my score slightly.  This has a tendency to become an open-table math problem in the final rounds, as each tile's impact on the score becomes completely calculable.

2016-07-11 - After one play, I think Santiago is definitely a game worth exploring. It's like a cross between Ra and Aquadukt (both of which I love). I think I like each of those games individually a little more than this one, but the combination does make for some unique decisions. We played half the game with one of the rules wrong (we weren't limiting the cube placement of people who passed), and that rule was really important, so don't do that.

A vicious auction game where a hefty opening bid may walk away with one of the least valuable tiles auctioned...ouch. But wait, you're not  done yet, as water needs to be adjacent to your crops to prevent spoilage. How much is that worth? Even if you make a nice offer will the ditch digger oblige you? As I said vicious....and I like it.

RATING: 8
Santiago is an auction game with a strong spacial element. Very classic euro-design. Economically, every player is on equal footing with identical incomes every turn. During the game you bid on plantation tiles, place the tiles you won by trying to group them with like tiles on the board, and then propose where the the next irrigation canal will be place. The last place auction loser becomes the overseer who can be bribed as to where to place the canal. Un-irrigated plantation tiles lose value or disappear altogether. At the end of the game. Groups of tiles mixed with ownership cubes create endgame multipliers. 

This is a nicely interactive classic auction game. The way tile placement plays off of canal placement is key. Timing when to be the overseer can be important as well, as some turns it can make you wealthy and other turns may not net you a thing. Although negotiation is not officially part of the game, there are lots of opportunities for suggesting tile placements and supporting each others' canal proposals. Very solid game.

Two words: underrated classic.

Santiago is a game of bribery and manipulation. Players plant crops and then fight over the water. Each round, one player will be the overseer. This player determines where the water flows, but will be the last to plant fields and may be coerced with bribes. A thriving field requires careful placement, strong-arm bribery, or both. You can also try to collude with other players by placing your new fields near theirs, so that a single ditch will irrigate both. In this case, you have the option of combining bribes to make the most attractive offer. Fields that aren't irrigated won't last long, and sometimes tiles are placed with the intent that they become barren and disrupt the future expansion of an opponent's profitable field. Though not a friendly game, Santiago isn't conflict-heavy either, and it's nice to see the difference manifest itself so clearly.

A practical downside is that the game shines with 5 players, but if you've got the right number it's an accessible, challenging, wicked game.

RATING: 8
A unique mix of tile-laying, bidding for turn order and bribing. This went completely under my screen on its release and if it weren't for the Spiel-by-Web implementation and its good reputation on BGG, I would have never played it. The most interesting feature is bribing the Canal Overseer for the right to build the irrigation channel of your choice. This is also the one feature that introduces a slight but manageable kingmaker/screwage factor. But there's more terrifying choices: how much to bid, cooperate or block, when to aim for the overseer.  All in all, Santiago has aged well compared with Today's Eurogames.

I've played this live a few times and a whole lot on SpielbyWeb.  It can be a very challenging game, and it can also be a runaway.

The bribing of the Canal Overseer is really what makes this fun.  Competitive with a very fun (at least for me) theme.  Would like to play this with 5, as someone would always get hit with drought.  With four (I've only played with four so far), everyone can potentially still share the available canals.

Update: Having played this on SBW, I see that maybe we didn't play very aggressively before.  There can be a lot of desolation in a competitive 5-player game!

This concept of this game is quite excellent and exactly my type of thing. I find it lacks hidden information though and someone could quite easily "game" a great deal of it.

Chock full of great mechanisms, but at the same time there's a really abstract and mathetical exercise feel to it and the game is also hugely prone to analysis paralysis and unfortunately also includes a tile lottery element. Also problematic is that you can be out of the game really early if you happen to have no luck in getting to take part in the huge plantations in which everybody else is involved. With 5 players this is really cutthroat, but at least with lesser amounts of players I somehow have less desire to play this after each time I play this.

Santiago is an exceedingly clever design that is a really interesting play on-line (spielbyweb.com).  But when you play it in-person, with just the right group of five, it really is a gaming experience like none other.  The "bribe" mechanic is genius.  And I particularly love how fast it plays.

Best with 5 players, fine with 4 (but put the spring on the edge of the board).  I have no desire to try it with 3, it just seems weird.

Here's an obscure theme with a very shrewd execution of play mechanics. This is a cutthroat game with excellent strategic potential. It has a very resource poor feel, and you can just feel yourself deflating when one of your potentially cash-cow crop fields is screwed over for irrigation.

Enjoyable, but not something I'd run out and buy, mostly because I don't engage with the theme very well. It is relatively quick and feels very tightly put together. Nothing sloppy about these rules.

RATING: 6.5
There's a clever interplay between bidding and victory points, since money serves as victory points, but it's in short supply until the final harvest.  I think people may focus too much on saving money during the game, since the money from the harvest will far outstrip  minor savings from the auctions.  The real constraint is having enough money to control future bidding.  I think timidity (e.g., always accepting suggested canals) is a recipe for disaster.

Somewhat of a mean game with significant indirect player interaction.  Ok depth despite very streamlined and easy to teach rules.  Quick play considering what's involved.  Clear winners and losers with a good spread between results (generally speaking).  Sort of in the same vein as casual placement game like Through the desert or Wacky Wacky West but with a hardcore bite.  Interesting mix.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Beyond it's streamlined simplicity and abstract elegance lies a very deep and dynamic game.  An excellent and very under-rated auction game involving tactical decisions involving tiles, cashflow and final multiplication scoring system.  There are numerous subtle offensive and defensive plays.  It plays best with five, but with four just simply place the spring on the edge of the grid; and with three, just place the spring on one of the the corners.  These suggestions allow for more tension with board tactics and decisions, making for a more interesting game.

First play was with 5 (supposedly the best number with which to play this game) and I really enjoyed the experience.  Picked a poor time to become the canal overseer which basically lost me the game.  We weren't extremely cut-throat in this game, and I'd really like to give this one another run with a bit more nastiness involved...:-)

With only two plays under the belt, what can I say about Santiago? It is a good game. It has a different feel that many other games. Hard choices due to hidden money and interesting auction mechanic. It can fall prey to analysis paralysis if certain types of people are involved. I'm eager to play some more.

RATING: 7
Santiago is an auction game with some clever mechanics.  You bid on a number of tiles equal to the number of players.  If you are the low bidder, you are the canal overseer and other players pay you for where the next canal goes.  Higher bidders select their tiles first.  You try to organize tiles of the same color together with the highest number of goods on them.  Each region scores points based on the number of tiles multiplied by the number of goods on the tiles in that color region.  

A simple game yet has some depth. I have played this with the family and it has gone over well.

Straightforward auction and tile placement game gets a great boost from the need to get WATER to your crops and the opportunity (no, necessity!) to bribe the canal overseer (another player) to run the irrigation canal where you want it.

The high bidders get the first choice of crops to be planted, and the sites where they would like to plant them.  The low bidder becomes the canal overseer and gets to decide (after considering the proposals of the other players along with whatever remuneration is being offered) where to build the canal.  Crops that don't get water wither and eventually revert irretrievably to desert, scoring their owner nothing.

Pure Gaming Goodness!!

Rating based on the (optimal) 5-player game.  I would drop my rating to 7 for less players.  You need 5 players so there's plenty of danger of your crops going thirsty.

I had high expections for this game based on the ratings and I am sorry to say it did not live up to them. I felt the experience was rather dry, mechanical, and uninspiring.  The bribing the overseer is a neat mechanic, but doesn't liven the game up enough as their choice is often obvious and not difficult to make. The components are drab and could use more flavor. Trying it out on SBW has not changed my opinion.

Very dry, prone to overanaylsis and the need to constantly recalculate the scores each turn is annoying but all this is compensated by the delightful viciousness of the play.

Whoever labelled this as a "negotiation" game though is just plain wrong - there is none.

RATING: 7.5
Purchased Used. Received Oct 4, 2008

Tight mechanics, quick play, tense moments.

I'm not much for auction games but this one doesn't feel like an auction. Instead, you get one chance at bidding for turn order.  Then based on turn order you get to select a tile from the pool of available options.  I like the "bribe" mechanic as well although I'm not one to mathematically analyze the merits of a bribe to the extent that I can see which choice (acceptance or payment) has more merit. To be a good player I think you'd have to be able to quickly do the math.  I play, for the most part, by my gut making very high level estimations as to the pros/cons of a bribe.  That's probably why I lose more than I win.

However, it's still a fun game.

Despite the smiling farmer cover art, this is quite a cut-throat bidding and negotiation game of planting fields and irrigating them. Things can get quite competitive and heated as the game progresses - not one for conservative players, despite the theme, which is quite well integrated.

This is a really good one!  Lots of fun player negotiations and interplay.  Quick turns keep you in the game the whole time.  I love the way you constantly work with and against the other players; constantly changing alliances.  It makes for a great "conversational" game.

Playing with 5-players is probably best  since some folks will be left without a water connection, thereby increasing "friction."  So, I guess that's sort of a negative, in that it optimally plays best with 4-5 players.

Simple and clear rules (albiet a little wordy) make for a quick start.  Nice production values (but the blonde and white squares are a little close in color.)  We like this one a lot and I think this will be a top favorite of our group.

RATING: 8
Tight negotiation game, which could lend itself to overanalyzing, but this is completely unnecessary, since others can easily screw any long-term plans. I play this with 5 preferably - the water source should be on the edge of the board at least, or even in the corner. 4p also works but placing the source in the corner then becomes mandatory.
I also prefer playing with "open" money, i.e. everybody knows how much money players have available for bidding and such. For some reason, this is the type of game where you'd really want to know, and hidden money doesn't add to the excitement anyway: VP's are not fully clear until the last tiles are layed and the last canal placed. Furthermore, hidden money takes away the core of the harsh negotiating aspect of Santiago, which is what the game is all about.

You're really only negotiating where to put the canal.  Where you place your tiles and how you spend your money is really the key to the game as these decisions will often influence The Canal Overseer.  Santiago is tense but very enjoyable.  It's really a tight, simple system and should play quickly with most groups.

Easy to learn excellent short game,intriguing decision, whether to bid more for a particular tile or least to become the overseer. Enjoyable bribe mechanic, do I put in a genuine bribe for a channel to my liking, or else a dollar value bribe to force the overseer to pay more for a irrigation channel to his liking.

A most delightful neglected classic that plays best at 5 player. An interesting set of game mechanisms, including  both bidding & negotiation as well as tile placement. The necessity to irrigate your crops and the limited nature of the water really make this both challenging and fun. Never a dull moment. Plays quick. Great rule book, so easy to learn and teach. Get it. Play it.

Excellent! Simple and very fun, yet deep and involving! Players compete to try and get the best location for their plantations and keep them irrigated.

Fine game.  Simplicity makes one initially suspect of it's cleverness or fun, but it pulls off both.  There's a math lesson in there somewhere in choosing to distribute your fields, or just go for the big one (and help others as well. . .).  Because it's also short, makes a fine family or lite game. . .just over an hour with 4.

I liked the game, but it's a bit too much math for me. The strategy seems quite subtle and almost in the abstract strategy department.

Santiago can be fairly brutal when played with the right crowd; aggressive players will enjoy the constant chances to mess with their neighbors' plans (though such messing does not always guarantee victory!)  This game is a solid 9 when played with five, but plummets way down to a 5 or 6 when played with fewer.  Fewer players means a much less aggressive game, which is a detractor, in my mind.

At first this game excited me for its combination of simple rules and seemingly multifaceted game play: a little bit of area control/investment, auctions, "bribing," and a dash of interactivity combined to make some solid initial outings for this game, chock full of "interesting decisions."

Unfortunately, further play has seen this title wither considerably. Optimal play is not interactive at all: you simply calculate the expected value of each available tile, consider turn order, and bid appropriately. I used to think that the auction evened out the luck of the tile draw (Great tile up for auction? Bid high! Where's the luck in that?), but these auctions work don't actually mitigate the luck. Based on the expected value of a tile, I could bid high to get it, and then get outbid by one by a subsequent bidder. They actually lose a tiny bit of money on the deal if they overbid, but I get destroyed since I pay up anyway without getting the good tile. Therefore, it's in your best interests to [i]not[/i] bid high, and just let whoever's last in turn order take the windfall of the lucky tile. Tile placement isn't that interesting either; you almost always want to place the tile where it benefits you the most, even though you might also be helping others out.

Thus, your decisions become fairly elementary through out the game. Basically, you're bidding 0 or 1 most of the time, unless it's a guarantee (e.g., You're last to bid and can assure yourself first pick.) that you'll turn a profit by outbidding everyone. I'm doing pretty well with this approach online, despite the luck of the draw, so it seems the difficulty of the game comes mostly from people not taking the time to estimate the value of each tile or realize that just because you bid high doesn't mean you're going to get the tile you want. I'm playing this as part of the 2014 10x10 Challenge, but I'm probably done with it after that.

8. Quick, easy game with some difficult choices. The bribe system for allocating the canal extension is the most fun aspect of the game, especially with 5 players. If I had to pick a single game that demonstrated the essence of a "Eurogame" this would be it. My only main beef with this game is the currency mix - why there are so many 50s and no 10s?????? >>>
Updated to a 6. Its not much more than a dry (pun unintended) math game, although the tile auction and canal bribing rounds make for some interesting tension. There just isn't much player interaction in this game. Best played with 5 players. Don't bother with only 3 players. Strongly considering a trade.
Updated to a 4. The more I play this the more I am bored by it. The main strategy is just to pass at the right time to position yourself for a later (and better) plantation bid. Somebody please take this off my hands!

I played this game with 3 and while I thought the game was easy to learn and play... very easy in fact... I can certainly see how a LOT of the potential angst that this game has going for it is missing in a 3 player game. In a 4 player game and especially a 5 player game I see Santiago as having much more potential to shine.

That being said... I really like the simplicity of the rule set of Santiago and the ability to play quickly and knock a game out in under an hour or so makes this a good game to get to the table fairly regularly.

All in all this is a game that will reward more plays with 4 and 5 players and strategies/tactics can be further developed in future games.

I expect my rating may rise once I play with 4 or 5... but for now I have to rate this honestly and with 3 there is certainly a bit lacking and only a glimpse of what this game can potentially deliver is showing.

RATING: 9
Santiago is an excellent example of how few rules and mechanisms can create an excellent game. The island is simply a grid with tiles representing fields and sticks representing canals. You need fields to score (the larger the group of similar fields, the greater the score) but if they aren't adjacent to canals they will dry up. To achieve this, you engage in bidding where the highest bidder places fields first and the lowest bidder places the canal (but can be bribed). This forces the players to constantly assess the values of crop and water and set their bids and bribes accordingly. Bidding and bribing to optimize tile laying - three of my favorite mechanisms in one short game!

Je me dois de réviser quelque peu à la baisse ma note Note de 8.8 de mai 2014. La raison: j'ai montré dernièrement ce jeu à deux groupes de joueurs (donc à huit personnes) et je n'ai pas vraiment rencontré chez eux l'euphorie que m'avait apporté Santiago lorsque je l'ai découvert.

L'aspect "négociations" et "king making" peut être très agaçant et une "mauvaise" décision d'un joueur - en particulier du Canal Overseer peut faire basculer la partie.

J'apprécie néanmoins beaucoup Santiago et il fait partie des jeux que je n'envisage vraiment pas de vendre ou d'échanger.

Bid for one of 5 kinds of plantations that can hold 1 or 2 laborers. Lowest bidder is canal master. Each player then bribes the canal master with some money on where the water flows.  Canal master chooses one bribe or rejects them. Only irrigated plantations will score at the end: for each contiguous, orthogonally adjacent plot of the same plantation, score your number of laborers times the number of that plantation in the plot. Can be cutthroat, takes a few games to understand the right values of bids.

Weirdly overlooked Euro from the early 2000s.

Low level of rules but a very high level of strategy, and constantly interesting decisions right throughout all the fazes of play.

As is usually the case when first playing a game (especially one with an auction component), none of the four of us had much idea what anything was worth. We wound up almost giving the game to one player by letting her get too powerful in one commodity. I really liked what I saw of this game and I look forward to further playings. I do have some concern about how much the game needs everyone to be on the same page strategically, though.*** A second playing with 4 has increased my opinion of this game. I think I will enjoy it even more with 5 players, cementing this as a solid 8.***Update 2/20/04*** After two playings with 5, I have to say that this may be my favorite of the newer games (Essen 2003). So simple yet so much anguish on every turn - and the game is quite cutthroat when you have the maximum 5 players! Highly recommended. ***UPDATE 6/3/04*** It's official - this is one of my favorites.

Fast-playing auction game with an interesting turn order mechanic. The luck of the tiles and the actions of other players are major outcome-influencing factors out of your control, but you can exercise valuation skills to determine how much to pay (and deduction skills to estimate how much your left-side neighbors are willing to). As simultaneously light and weighty as it was, I didn't personally find it to be a winner, at least not yet.

Light but solid bidding and tile laying game, with some original mechanisms that work very well.

The rules are easy and even if they follow the theme and they even provide some funny detail, like the Canal Supervisor's bribes, the game feels totally abstract. The box size is too big, with plenty of air, and an impractical good quality insert. The graphic design is bad and feels too old.

The main mechanism is the bidding that controls the game actions. The Supervisor's mechanism is probably the most original and fun, it's integrated seamlessly with the rest of the game, and works more than fine.  

Ovreall, it's a light game with a decent tactic content, interaction, and some basic negotiation.

The gameflow is very dynamic. It progresses fast and even if you can't do anything during the time between turns, you don't have to wait a lot. But to me, the game feels long. There are just too many turns doing the same over and over.

I also think the game might not be at its best with 3 or less players.

Enjoyed this much more than I expected to. Classic abstract-y euro-style from its time period. Extremely easy to teach and plays fast, with just enough interesting choices to keep it from bogging down. I used to think this was an ugly-looking game, but after seeing in person I now like it. The icons are all very clear, and the colours are all pleasing. Really nice bidding mechanic, basically begging the current "engineer" to build where you want by slipping him some extra cash. Or, be the first to bail and pass, and _be_ the next engineer.

My only concern with this game is that it can probably just be mathed out every turn and a simple formula for point gain might be decided upon. Maybe not, if looking at long-term scoring and adding blocking tactics into things.

There's a lot more going on here than you'd expect, and the game rewards those that concentrate as much on what others are doing as what they are doing themselves.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

I managed a second play which left me wanting more. This is a nasty game that combines area control with bidding/bribery. What more can you ask for? I've enjoyed it at both 4 and 5 players, but wouldn't recommend it with less because you need there to be competition on the board. One of the best area control games I've played, right behind El Grande and Triassic Terror. This might be one I can get played at my game group now. If you're looking for a confrontational area control game look no further, in some ways Lords of Vegas is the family friendly version of Santiago.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I really enjoyed this game, perfect blend of strategy and negotiation. The use of the once around auction mechanic not only creates a lot of tense moments (every $ counts in this game), it also keeps the game moving along at a quick pace. The added dimension of having one player be in charge of placing the additional water each round adds further negotiation and planning, you really have to pay attention to everyone and make sure you're not placing your crop where the chances of it getting watered are slim to none. 

I would always be willing to play this game, but I think you need at least 4 players. Unfortunately even though my buddy Mat owns this game I don't think I'll get to play that often if at all, hopefully I'll get the chance at Totalcon this year.[/i]

A clever little game with innovative mechanics, it's almost pure game theory. A mix of auction and temporary emergent alliances. Low luck. 

I worry it might get samey after too many plays (currently at 8 plays, June 2010)

Works best with 5 because you have more players working together, but 4 is still good.

I want to like this game.  The design is clever and it feels like there is a rewarding strategy in the game.  At the end of the game I am always left feeling disappointed, when I win and when I lose.  When things work out I feel fortunate, and not like I planned well.  I would never refuse to play this game, but if I am going to be bidding, I would so much rather play Ra.

The reviews implied that this was a whine-fest game which had turned me off, but it wasn't at all. It was all about the money, and money talks. Except when it doesn't ... and then it can get very cut-throat, but usually in a fun way. Except when you start playing with all experienced players who know all the dirty pus tricks, and then it's a table-talking, king-making whine-fest. Which takes the shine off a bit and loses it a rating point.

I think this game is really about cooperating with other players, and figuring out what the overseer wants.  If everyone can come to a tacit agreement over where the water should go, that's probably where it will go.  If you try going against the grain, you'll probably be marginalized.  And when bribing, you always have to be aware of the overseer's stake in the matter is.

Way at the high end of player interaction in a euro, and this is a good thing here. Nice turn-order bidding, a really cool bribery system, and plenty of opportunities for screwage and positioning make an exciting game. That said, there is a lot of chaos and a bit of luck owing to the tile turnover, so I'm not sure it's got as much replay value for me as some of the more strategic euros.

Very fun game that moves quickly.  There are a lot of decisions to make and they get more difficult as the game goes on.  I love the simple auction mechanics plus the bribery, which involves all kinds of clever play, and allows for some tactical hosing possibilities.  One warning, though: some people don't like this game at all with less than 5, though I have yet to try it with three.  I've found 4-player Santiago just as fun.

Although this is an inherently nasty little game, I enjoy some elements in the design, such as speculating what plots will come out, the limited economics and how to fleece that cash from your opponents, though the last bit is a little subtle for my mind. Although I feel that the overseer's psyching out the desires of others is similar to that in Industria and Goa, in Santiago the assessment is alittle easier and allows personalities to talk it up. So it can be fun to victimise or change your commitments, but beware of not making too many enemies. I just can't see myself playing this game with the family though, besides the fractured varying scores makes me lose interest in each player's status and the tallying up is abit of a chore.

This is a very mathy player negotiation game, where players bid for turn order, with each player getting their choice of farming tile type, but the last player in order gets to place the critical water piece that will prevent the farming tiles from dying out. Other players get to bribe that player as to where to place the water. It's a fascinating dance, and the whole game plays very quickly. The question is, is this game too mathy for me? It's all about calculating cubes times region size for each player, so you can tell how much your move will help you vs how much it will help your opponents.

Just a terrific auction and tile placement game when played by equally strong players (played 2 4-player game). Apt screwage occurs when players can't be browbeat but play to their own advantage.

Like my fellow player said, the board may not look like much bit this is a very neat a good game. This is the perfect example why I prefer uni-board games to multi-solitaire games. Despite being galaxies simpler than Agricola or Puerto Rico, this game is much more interactive and clever, forcing the players to consider their opponents moves and eventually bribing them to help them out. Very simple, very clever. HX

RATING: 8
Santiago is a brutal game built on a simple foundation.  Plantation tiles are revealed and players bid on turn order.  The tiles are of various types.  In turn order players choose a tile, place it and put their workers on it.  The lowest bidder also becomes the canal overseer.  Then players offer bribes to the canal overseer so that he will send water to their plantations.  At the end of a turn, un-watered plantation tiles dry out.  This requires a player to remove one of his workers from that tile.  If there are no workers on a tile when it dries out it becomes a barren blocking space.  At the end of the game each contiguous set of like plantation tiles is worth a number of points to each player equal to the number of tiles in it times the number of workers a player has in the plantation.

Santiago is a cleverly disguised investment game.  If I have two workers in a plantation and another player adds a tile to it, i.e. invests in it, we both will get a net gain in points.  If there is a large plantation that I'm not a part of getting a couple of workers into it can increase my score a great deal.  Players become co-owners of the different plantations and in that sense ally with each other.  Players are constantly vying to get a few workers in the big plantations and if they have a plurality build them as large as possible.  This is where bidding for turn order is very important.  If you can go first you can get and place the most valuable tile, extend a large plantation and scoop up tons of points.  And if this were all there was to the game it would be absolutely bland.

The game provides a number of ways to sabotage the other players.  You can use tile placement to block off plantations and keep them from growing.  Also, you need to water your plantation tiles to keep your workers on them.  This gives the canal overseer power over life and death.  If he's not bribed well enough he won't send the water where you want it.  Because players will have overlapping interests alliances will form and fall, players can go in together on bribes that help themselves or merely hurt other players.  This is one of those games where it is useful sacrifice points if it causes other players to lose even more.  The various affects of your actions can be quite subtle and far reaching.  The game loses some urgency with fewer players.  It's not a bad game with three, but it is orders of magnitude better with a full compliment of five.  Santiago is a great 60 minutes of amoral survival-of-the-fittest cut-throat economics and tile placement.

1st played this around 2002 and 8 years later it still holds a top spot.  Settlers, El Grande, and others have drifted by the wayside for me but I'm still eager to play this any chance I get.

I would almost consider this the perfect euro.

1. good player interaction
2. simple rules
3. very tactical
4. Plays in at around 1 hour.

If I had to cull my collection to under 20 games, this one would make the cut.

Slightly underwhelmed, although like to try this with the recommended three players. Not enough conflict over irrigation placements and the decision making was low. Nice, clean mechanics however.

Update: Now played with three. Just don't like it very much. Bit like Modern Art with negotation, threats, bluff, etc with the placement of irrigation, but everything is out in the open. You can count your money and then each VP for placement of resources every turn, which makes the game too much hard work.

An enjoyable game.  The rules are simple, but come together to give some opportunity for clever play and reward the divining of your opponents' intentions.  Although technically it is a series of two auctions a turn, the bidding is so influenced by your place in the turn order and the availability of your reserve canal, that each bid feels quite different.  Santiago features that blend of co-operation and competition that makes games like Blue Moon City so enjoyable, though Santiago offers the opportunity to be substantially nastier than Blue Moon City does.  Never breaks down to be too analytical, and so rocks along nicely. Recommended.

RATING: 8.42
Santiago is a very simple game. Players bid for the order in which they choose crops to sow, then the player who did worst in this arrangement decides how to irrigate fields - taking into account any bribes they are offered. At the end of the game fields yield a cash crop and the player with the most money wins.
Santiago is incredibly simple but this only helps enhance the diplomatic element as players negotiate for water. Like most such games it needs players, at least four I suspect, probably best with five, but if you have an itch for a negotiation game that doesn't take weeks to play this would certainly scratch it.
The downside is of course that it is a negotiation game, and there are some people who just don't like that sort of thing.

RATING: 9
It is quite a feat for a game to give such a strong first impression on the first go, but Santiago did just that. Edit: I've since played it more, and the strong positive first impression stuck. 

It hits all my high points: an elegant ruleset, an abundance of social presence driven by auctions, bribing, and negotiations, and a semi-open decision space. This perfect storm of mechanisms resulted in one of the most enjoyable, cutthroat, and interactive board gaming experiences I have ever had the pleasure to play.

The criticisms aimed at Santiago largely imply that this experience is group dependent, though I think it unfair to drop my rating until I encounter such an issue personally. I do sense that this game would not shine so well at lower player counts. I would venture 4+ players is -the- only way to play. It is a crying shame that this game has fallen into obscurity. 

(+) Possesses a brilliant combination of rules and mechanisms that firmly places players in the driver seat.
(+) Presents tense, tight, engaging decisions from the get-go.
(+) Promotes high player interaction. 

(-) The gameplay may suffer when playing with the presence of ~that one player~ who calculates and re-calculates every optimal outcome (that is, the AP prone) and explicitly avoids (nay, abhors) heuristic estimation of who is in the lead. It is possible for temporary alliances to be formed to keep this "power gamer" type in-check.
(-) The tone is perhaps "too cutthroat" for a significant number of players predisposed to avoiding conflict. Playing with less than 4 or 5 players likely reduces conflict (and to me, less fun). In a sense, this limits the widespread appeal of the game.
(-) Out of print.

only played online - rating may go up irl with negotiation but i am in no rush to find out

'solid' but dull

update - im not even sure its solid - very prone to luck vs bid order - if there are 2 very good tiles and 3 useless ones then there is no incentive fot the 1st 3 players to bid high cos the last 2 will just outbid them and u will be left paying high for nothing so the 1st 3 bid low and the last two get 12+ worth tiles for a few coins - i think this bidding system is at best dull and possibly broken

just discovered horrible calculation/kingmaker endgame problems - i never want to play this game again..at least online

online rating 4 - but ill postpone proper rating cos i think it may change a lot in real life

--17Aug2005-- Delightful and ferocious game on one play.  Both more and less of a game arc than I'd expected:  it is just the same action repeated over and over; yet there's much more significance to the decisions made in the middle of the game (in terms of one's final score) than at the end - which is interesting.  It wouldn't surprise me if the ability to perceive that inflection point would correlate well with high scores!
--Oct2005-- Rated 8 after a few more plays.

Gotta say I like this one in spite of thinking its a lame theme.  Don't get me wrong..  I think the theme fits...  it just doesn't sound engaging.
I love the possible screw-age that develops in this title.  Having to balance between the points on the board and the funds in your hand is a nice aspect.  Plus I laugh when I think of the 'nanners and 'giners.

This game is good but you have to have good gamers for it.  I played it with some people who aren't really gamers and messed with someone the first round, and he took it badly.  But that was the first incident in 30 plays or so of it.

Simple mechanics that give a deep enough gaming experience. My only grief is that as all the scores are out for everyone to see, and there's no good way to keep track of them except counting them every turn, analysis paralysis can take over later in the game. Maybe there should be more money moving around?

This is a great bidding/bribing game. It takes a while to really figure out what you should bid on things, but after that its great. It also is somewhat heavier than it appears, so it can be draining.

RATING: 8
Nice quick friendly gateway game, with elements of auction, tile-laying, and area control. But... cool bribery mechanism aside, it sometimes feels like just another Euro. Calculate expected value, buy at auction, lay tiles, area control, wooden cubes, etc. They say that this is best with 5, though (which makes sense for auctions, bribes, tile placement etc), and I haven't played with 5 yet.

Great rulebook and components (especially the tiles), but a really flimsy insert. I'd like to see someone like Uberplay reprint this as a bookshelf game, given that the board is so small.

Update: played with 5, and while it was a bit better, there still wasn't much angst. Next step will be to try with 5, with the spring on a board edge or corner, which the rules recommend for experienced players.

Update: losing interest in this a bit. Dropped back to 7.

Update: played with the spring on the board edge and finally got the required level of player interaction, even with only four players. On the basis that I'll always play with the spring on an edge or corner from now on, I'm bumping this to an 8.

Update: back to 7... finding it quite dry and programmed now, though still good mechanically.

(Traded.)

Update: back again to 8. Perhaps this means it's really a 7.5? Anyway, depends on the group as to whether it's dry or awesome.

RATING: 5
Reasonable fun. Interesting decisions to be made in a game that runs a nice length and isn't overly complicated. Tile draw and seating order add a huge amount of luck to the game. My main complaint is that the seating order can have a big impact on a player if they're continually finding themselves going first or second in a round - going last seems more often than not to be the best because you can see what the other players have bid and overbid or slide into a free slot to get a tile you want.

RATING: 7
Very nice Euro with easy rules, deep gameplay and full of difficult choices and tension.  It goes around agriculture and the struggle to get water for plantations in a dry land.  Definitively, it has everything that a game needs to be one of the best.  Nevertheless it has a major flaw, besides its ugly art, that doesn't allow such pleasure:  One of the players can decide, with little restrictions, where to irrigate and, since that affects all others, it could be the perfect scenario for kingmaker situations, as it happened in my only play of the game.

RATING: 9
In Santiago, player compete in auctions to purchase plots of banana, potato, sugar cane, bean, and chili pepper fields. Each plot can support one or two workers/markers of your colour. The object of the game is to have your markers on plots within larger fields of the same type of produce: your score will be the area of the field times the number of your workers within it. The trick is that you must ensure that your fields are irrigated, otherwise they will dry out, costing you workers and eventually turning the plot to desert. The player who bids the least in the plot auction becomes the Canal Overseer for the round - this person gets to decide where the irrigation canal will be placed and which plots will or will not receive water. To entice the Overseer to irrigate your plots, players can offer bribes which the Overseer can accept or ignore. If they ignore the bribes, they must pay 1 Escudo (the currency in the game) more than the largest bribe (players can combine their bribes to make them higher) and place the canal wherever they wish.

This is a fun, viscous, mean game. It seems to play equally well with 4 or 5 players and is still okay at 3. The game is at its best when players are deliberately working to screw each other over by placing plantations in different areas of the board to ensure that at least one will not receive water this round. The game could bog down if players choose to work out the arithmetic for all of the possible positions each turn, but if you just play by feel, and let the number-crunchers be damned, it's a quick, evil, little game. Highly recommended.

Anyone ever accused a game of _too_ much player interaction?

This game is just brutal! Compare with, say, Ticket to Ride - a game where the player interaction is in the form of cutting people off, taking the routes they need in order to score big. Well, in Santiago, you basically have no routes unless other players grant them to you! And cutting each other off is just necessary to the game. And if you grab for power too much - as the Overseer - you usually don't stand a chance of having nearly enough crops out there to grab a high score with.

If you find that tensions are high when you play this - that everyone is getting mad at each other and backstabbing each other and so on - then you're playing it right.

A good tactical placement and biding.

You must growth your plantation in according them with irrigation.

The lowest bidding player became the overseer who place irrigation.  So as he is the most important player, he can be bribing.
So none player is totally lost in the game (you have money, you can bid and acquire good plantation, you haven't, you became overseer).

Santiago -- Played four- and five-player.  Generally I agree with Tom Vasel's review -- it's a sleeper which will be garnering more praise over time.  I particularly like that the Overseer is both a powerful position and a financially undesirable one.  The "backup" canals provide that fun kind of tough decision -- use it now and risk needing it later, or save it and risk regretting lost opportunities.  Then there's the necessity of preventing fields turning barren.  Of course, most praise-worthy is the constant player interaction.

This is an okay game, but it didn't really appeal to me.  Bribing the canal overseer to ensure your fields were watered isn't usually necessary in a three or four player game, and that drops most interesting mechanic in the game.  The "agressively screw someone out of the water" tactic seemed overly spiteful, so our games turned in to attempts to benefit the most from large fields.  Unfortunately, the game bogs down when players calculate and recalculate their relative scores in various fields to determine their optimal move.

RATING: 9
[10 plays] 5 player games are by far the best. However, I will play this with 4 if the starting well is placed on the edge to assure a more competitive game. Anything less and all of the interesting decisions and tension falls out of the game.

This game is nifty. It strongly regulates the auctions in a fashion that somehow doesn't feel too restricted. This keeps the game moving and presents some interesting decisions. The canal proposal bids are so deliciously cut-throat at times. I love this game. Use the palm trees, keep the game moving briskly, and try to balance your board play with the need to become canal overseer at those crucial and lucrative times.

Most recent play completed 5-16-09 on SpielbyWeb with Donovan, Alex, Corey, and Michael.

RATING: 7.5
A middle weight strategy game where players bid on crops and plant them. The twist it that failure to irrigate the crops will lead to them drying out and in turn, a loss of income.

The canal overseer (person who didn't bid or bid the lowest) gets to take 'bribes' as to where the canal gets placed. 

Good solid game with a little bit of nastiness. Not great with 3 but shines with 4 or 5.

For a more 'evil' game, players don't get the extra free canal.

Auction, Negotiation, Tile-laying. Nice one-hour filler  game. Money management is tight and there are some intriguing posibilities on where/when you place tiles. Only played some 3p games so far, looking forward to some nasty 4p or 5p games, which I assume will feature valuable player plantations drying up all over the place.

EDIT: dropped rating a bit and traded away. After further plays, especially with more people, the end game became unsatisfyingly automatic; I feel like I have little choice on what to do and everyone can basically calculate their final move from the visible score.

Update: I've been playing this some more on SpielByWeb and have a greater appreciation for it now. Can be a very calculating game. Bumped rating back up.

Ültess különböző növényeket, hozz létre nagybirtokokat belőlük és persze ne felejtsd el öntőrendszerrel ellátni őket! Jó mechanizmusú, építkezős játék. A játékosok licitálnak az ültetvényekre, plusz van mindig egy vízvezetékásó is, akit le lehet fizetni, hogy a mi ültetvényünk felé vezesse a vizet.
Rontottam a pontozáson egy értéket. Már csak 6-osra értékelem a játékot. Egyértelműen 5-en érdemes játszani, esetleg 4-en, de 3-an semmiképp. Mivel az aukció az egész játék egyik fő pontja, ez hárman nem igazán működik. Illetve kicsit túl egyértelmű lépések vannak. Ha van egy hely, ahova még vezet csatorna, akkor egyértelmű, hogy odakerül a következő ültetvény. Ritkán kap pénzt a csatornaásó. Hárman semmiképp nem ajánlom.

I really had to think long and hard about giving this a nine.  But, here's the deal, it has every thing I like in it wrapped in a nice package.  Mild negotiation, innovative Auction Mechanic, fun area control mechanism, evokes the theme, lots of interaction, and most of all there is a high but controllable screwage factor.
This game has a terrific sense of incorporating all the things I love in modern Eurogames in a new and insightful manner. Great Bidding system, wonderful area control mechanism, Fine sense of movement, nicely balanced turn order, and edgy negotiations that don't overwhelm the game. Plus, you can just be down right nasty. One of the most under-appreciated games I've played. 
This one is going to find itself among my favorites. 

UPDATE: After many plays this has well earned its ranking, in fact I've upgraded it to a 9.5.  One of the best games made in my opinion. UPDATE: This bloom has never faded, it just gets better and better.  I have to give it a 10.

Based on a game with three, but I think that a game with more would tighten things up and make it a much more interesting game. -- After a game with four, I found the game much more interesting, especially since the auction winner no longer collected two tiles instead of one.  Still interested in playing with five.

Santiago is an auction and tile-laying game with simple rules but complex strategy. The canal overseer makes the game what it is. Because the role goes to the lowest bidder, there are incentives to bid the lowest for the role as well as the highest for the best tiles. This squeezes the auction, creating large gains from small differences. Because the canal overseer holds a lot of power, there's a nice mix of extortion, temporary alliances, deal-making, and nastiness--all arising organically from the incentive structure. Very good, elegant, underrated game.

First play at DragonCon with Eddie, Mary, Joelle and Todd.

The game: each round, you auction off the right to choose plantation fields (which come in several types). The trick is that every bid must be different. You place the fields onto the board with 1 or 2 workers (depending on the tile); 1 less if you bid 0. Whoever bid lowest (or first person to bid if tied) is the Canal Overseer. Everyone makes offers of money for the CO to place a canal in a certain position; they can also support someone else's offer. The CO takes cash and plays a water token, or pays 1 more than the highest bid and plays elsewhere. All tiles touching water are OK; others lose 1 worker (and are flipped over if no workers left). Play through all 45 tiles (fewer if <5 players?) then earn money: each contiguous group of like tiles pays $= #tiles x #ofYOURworkers. Whoever has the most money at the end wins.

This is a really good game! The auctions, requiring different bids, are interesting; and the CO-related decisions (when to become CO; whose offer to accept) are also fun.

It's interesting how one of the better new games doesn't get played that often relative to how good it is, while other lesser games receive much more play.  Why is that?  In fact, I've only played it once so far myself!  After one play, I really like the blend of bidding, diplomacy, and negotiation.  Even the tile placement wasn't too bad for me.

Great game, at least with 5--we've got a sign-up sheet to play this one so it'll be quite some time before we play it with less than a full compliment!  Curious I may even like this as welll as Power Grid with 5, I'll need a few more plays though to decide.  Often crushingly difficult decision to make each round--more so than PG.  Far more bluff and counterbluff and a bit more subtlety as well.  A bit smoother tension graph (how tense the game is at any particular point in time).

This is SO much better than Power Grid, I shudder at the comparison I made.

RATING: 7
[Z-man 2005 edition] {Farming, economic; bidding, tile-laying, pattern-building; optimal 4-5p} {basic rules 7, 3-palm-trees variant 7} Santiago has an interesting concept of canal building and bribe. It is thematic and the game system integrates with the farming theme nicely. The system is also effective and each turn is fast. It is a nice twist of area-majority game with bidding. It is an excellent medium-weight game and is one of the best games that run within an hour. 

Players need to use money very wisely.  Santiago is a tactical with some planning and risk-taking game because of the tile draw, which makes it hard to predict what will happen after 3 rounds. Usually, there are obvious decisions each round. However, the game is vulnerable to chaos because canal observer is not bound to take the highest offer, if the canal observer is irrational the game will fall flat. In addition, the cost to be canal observer is comparatively low. Therefore, it can happen that canal observer determines the fate of the game.

While I am tired of the plantation-worker theme, Santiago adds enough to the formula to keep it fresh. The tactical choices in whether to be the irrigation manager, how much to bid for your choice irrigation spot, etc. adds a lot of interaction and diplomacy to what could've been a very dry (excuse the pun) and generic cube-pushing experience. The point multipliers you can earn by grouping like vegetables--even with your opponents--make the game even more interesting, as there's constant debate over whether it's worth giving your opponent more points in order to jump in on their huge patch of peppers. Great game, I'm looking forward to trying this again.

Auction / tile placement / area-influence game with a tricky twin-step round where first you bid for order of choosing & placing crops, and then you have to bribe the lowest bidder to route the irrigation canal towards your tiles, otherwise your hard-earned plot turns to worthless dust. Good fun!

RATING: 6.5
Game that really is all about working with other players and trying to manipulate them and others to help you or avoid hurting you at least. It is good, but a bit *too* direct for my tastes now. I once gave the game a solid 7, but it has fallen a bit due to how direct the confrontation can be. Plus, the game has a lot of math involved that can get a bit repetitive or overly thinky for my current tastes. Still a game I'll definitely play when in the right mood though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Abstract area majority/tile placement game with a lot of player interaction. There are quite a few mechanisms driving the game but at its core this is an exercise in bidding and negotiating. Each turn a number of tiles depicting various crops are revealed and players bid to obtain them. The tiles are then placed onto a board where they have to be irrigated, and it is the building of canals to water the various crops that is of most importance to succeeding in the game, as only one canal can be built a turn, which potentially leaves areas of the board unirrigated and therefore turned to desert. One player has the role of canal overseer, who determines where the canal is built, and this player can be bribed by the other to build in areas preferable to them. They can however ignore the bribes thereby forgoing the opportunity to earn money that will be helpful later on in the game, but also enabling them to build the canal in the most advantageous way to themselves. It is the interaction between players during the bribery phase and the potential to leave opponents’ crop without water and therefore useless that makes this a compelling game, one that at first glance appears to be quite light but in reality is rather compelling.

RATING: 8
Played 5+ times.  {5p:8, 4p:7, 3p:7.5}  This is a quick game of plantation construction.  You bid for the plantations and then bribe the canal overseer to direct the irrigation canal where you want it.  The scoring is the size of the field times the number of workers you have in the field.  I really like the balance of the monetary system and the fighting for the irrigated available land.  The four player game is friendlier than 5 or three, because the canal can irrigate four fields a turn.  This makes the five and 3 player games more interesting. **UPDATE** the more I play this the more I realize that I have nothing to complain about the game.  This seems to be rare as of late so I thought it worth mentioning. You just sit down and play and get engrossed.  I don't get distracted by any thing while playing and just enjoy the subtle negotiation. **UPDATE** mostly calculable score makes for late game slow play.  The four player game merely reduces the money to be gained from being the overseer and requires an adjustment in approach to the game.  2007/12/04

Finally a Euro that matches it's theme! That theme is stuff drying up.
Which is how my brain cells feel playing this. Yes, there is this semi-cooperative nature about placing the irrigation, plus it has easy scoring so no spreadsheet, which is a plus. The best part about the game is the interesting bidding mechanic up front. 

However, the theme doesn't do it for me. Furthermore, the game is repetitive as there is not really a tension arc. The visuals and components do not help either.

So, while solid, there is just nothing that really triggers me to actually go look for this game adding it to my collection. Wouldn't mind a play but it would definitely not be something I'd suggest to spend game time on. Pass.

You will stab your best friend in the back, and you'll both laugh at how much fun that is.  Love how there is a weight of loss an opportunity by electing to be pepe and how that can be helpful sometime.  Just don't underestimate your buddy getting that one crucial tile, that can put him in a major victory points lead in fact you may think you did better that you actually did in the end of the game, but the game is fun, all the while you are playing it.  If you like screwing over your friends, there is absolutely no funner way to do it.

Played this for the first time last night and I was impressed by its simple rules and interesting mechanics.  The bidding procedure is quite fun as is the influencing-the-overseer bit.  I also liked how, in most cases, your actions could also benefit your opponent.  I wonder whether this game has limited future playability, but there is an additional rule that uses palm trees so maybe that might extend it a bit.  Good first playing though.

I've played this several times now.  It offers interesting decisions, but I feel like there are other games that I'd rather play most of the time.

It's a great negotiation game, but is essentially 5 player only.  You can mitigate this somewhat by sticking the spring on the side for 4 player.  There are other negotiation games that give me some of the same sort of feelings, but this one boils it down to nuts and bolts.

Interesting decision process on this game, I read several good reviews on it and thought it would work well based on the comments, but once I got it and played through a game mentally in my mind while reading the rules I had my doubts based on all the calculation it looked like you would have to do at the end of the game.  However our first play proved it was as good as the reviews.  Calculating the final income at the end was quick and easy and we all ended up within 8 points off one another, with the person we thought would lose coming in first.  Clearly there is more here and enjoying it that much out of the gate can only mean it will be fun finding it.

Dropped from 8 to 7 11/16/07

Great game! Players pick out fields to place on the board - the order of players is determined by auction where the highest bidder does first. 

However, the lowest bidder gets the "Overseer" and gets to decide where to build Canals with which to water those fields. Fields not next to canals eventually become barren! Players get to bribe the "Overseer" to build the next canal in the place of their choice. Player with the most money at the end of the game wins! 

Simple game, fabulous interaction. Might get a bit mathy as you work out how much a particular move is worth to you. But the game plays quick, and is gaming goodness in the space of an hour.

I have only played with 5 as many suggest that is the best.  

The canal overseer is a great mechanic and we have had some great moments with the auction then the bribe.  We play this with a little bit of negotiation and for our group that works well.

Update: I've introduced this to a new group and still the same results: people love it. With this group, however, we do not encourage any negotiation. I like that better. For one, it moves more quickly. 

Another reason is that the game is slightly less mean. No temporary alliances and subsequent broken ones. 

Of course, there are the natural alliance developed and broken during the course of play, but nothing negotiated.

Another virtue of Santiago is that it is pretty easy to teach.

I still have only played this with 5



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3

Interestingly crunchy negotiation game. Each round, players bid on a set of crop tiles, with the lowest bidder (or first passer) being given the next section of canal to lay. Without irrigation, all planted crops decay away to desert in 2-3 turns. There's a round of bribery over the placement of the next canal, and the overseer can freely choose, or even lay their own segment, but only if they outbid the largest bribe.

Points are given at the end for leftover money, or having the most crop control markers in the largest contiguous regions of crops. There's some great bits in precise control of turn order, collaboration, and adjustment of incentives. The random crop tiles could become irritating, but it's a nicely time-bounded game while still retaining negotiation.

RATING: 8
Fun auction game with positional element, fast and easy to play, though I use a calculator to find the final score and I suppose trying to do these calculations mid-game could bog it down. I was kind of surprised that land going unwatered was not that common; players get a freebie canal to place, and place tiles where they think other players will help get them watered, which is usually enough to keep all the tiles happy.

Weird phenomenon where a player in the lead can stop bidding on tiles, become overseer, and then collect bids for canal placement, resulting in a ton of money at game end. [This comment makes me wonder if I had a rule wrong originally.] Bashing the leader seems difficult.

...Upping rating a hair two years later. I like how elegantly this models players holding shares in corporations (even though that's not the game's theme). Incentive among players to cooperate arises rather organically.

The main limitation to enjoyment is still the fact that calculating point deltas (e.g. whether a move helps the leader more than it helps you, even if no other move would help you more) is feasible but annoying.

That said, ideal moves aren't overly calculable in general. Writing an AI to play Santiago wouldn't be trivial. You have to weigh somehow the uncertainty of what other players will do (e.g. what they might bid for tile selection order, or what the current overseer will decide to do).

Acquired June 10, 2005.  This is an outstanding game which is very easy to play but still has a lot of depth and seems to be enjoyed by everyone that plays it.  I should also mention that I am horrible at it, having failed to win any of the 5+ games that I have played.

RATING: 7.5
Too bad this game looks so dull. That really makes this game hard to get to the table the first time. The board is really small (much smaller than it seems on the pictures here at BGG) and, well, there really is not much else in the oversized box. But I can assure you: Once you have played this beauty, you will be really glad you did! The game (in which bribing is an integral part of gameplay!) is as cut-throat as you want it to be (in fact, I would recommend discussing with the group if the overseeer is allowed to make deals before you start) and suspenseful for the whole 1,5 hours that a typical game takes. It is quite easy to explain as well, so you could play it with just about anybody who does not take a game to personally. Just do not play this game with people who want to calculate all the points on the board every time they have to make a decision - that pretty much kills the spirit of the game.

July 2016: Sold on Geek Market. I enjoyed this game in the early days of my gaming, but it never got to the table.

3 plays: This game has been a toss up with the groups I have played with, with some liking it and others not. Personally I think it's a great five player game that keeps everyone involved, but it does feel like it takes a while to reach a somewhat unsatisfying conclusion.

The game's theme is not really appealing at all, planting crops and earning money....really dry. Oddly enough,this game really is a solid given the shallow theme. Even though each turn passes relatively fast and the game flows very quickly, it has amazing depth. Every decision has implications and consequences that impact the entire game. I find the Canal Overseer to be less powerful than first thought. Nonetheless, timing is everything for getting the overseer and a couple of good turns can really pad your wallet for the next several round. Overall, a 7 in my book.

Played once at Origins 05.  This is a happy little farming game about planting, growing, and corruption.  Everyone bids on the right to pick a crop first, but the lowest bidder gains power over which crops get water.  After bidding for crops, everyone can try to bribe the lowest bidder for canal placement.  Crops that don't get water, wither, then die.  Dead crops take up space and can block expansion, which means someone might pick a crop that they don't intend to keep alive, just to block off part of the board.  This game has some potentially interesting play, and I look forward to trying it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The endgame scoring reminds me of Fossil (ugh), and even with five players the competition for plantations and canals is lower than I'd wish.  Ultimately, I think it's a somewhat bland game with more computation than strategy, though I'd probably have a  higher opinion of this title had I not just played Fossil two days before trying this out.

What fun. This is a great mix of auctions, money management, timing, bribery, cooperation and screwage. The theming is a little drab, but there is a great sense of barely scraping by on the edge of subsistence. It's hilarious how much money is included in the game. I think the presence of all of those large bills is just to make you painfully aware of how poor you are.

After one play, I'm a little disappointed. The game play seemed fine, although we were all feeling out the game so it will probably be better next time we play it. The thing I really didn't like was the scoring at the end. It was really confusing and it was like seperating out a mess a spaghetti. Perhpas we were doing something wrong.

Irrigate and cultivate various crops to score the highest amount of money. The game is a mix of area control where players buy tiles at auction to increase the value of crops - but their ability to retain that value and control of the fields depends on irrigation. The most interesting mechanic here is that of the "canal overseer" - the player bidding lowest for the crop tiles plays last but decides where the next irrigation will be placed; his decision can be influenced via bribes from other players. Depending on the group, this "bribing" process brings about a good level of negotiation and interaction between the players. Rules are easy and the strategies are solid. Plays in less than 60 min, which is fantastic for a game with such strategic depth. Components are well produced. Great, fun game!

After 1 play with 5p: So many here describe the game as being to dry-- perhaps they did not bribe the canal overseer enough for more water...  Thanks, thanks, I'll be here all week, enjoy the prime rib and tip your waiter. But seriously, I liked this game a lot. It was quick, and poked and prodded my brain in a lot of different ways all at once. I think what I enjoyed most was the shifting alliances: at moments, part of the group is playing collaboratively becuase of a shared interest in a certain crop. But allainces shift and canal overseers, owing to the terrible work conditions perhaps, are a mean lot! Everything about the game feels clever to me. Like a beautiful analog watch, the fit of the different pieces (auction of tiles, bribing, tactical choice of when to play the savior canal) feels elegant too. I think my one complaint (after one play) is that I am just not a fan of the A x B scoring mechanism (used here, and Oasis, and others.) I have found in games with AxB scoring, the scoring opportunities at the end are just too huge relative to the availible choices. In other words, the depth of the choices at the end is constrained, but the value of each choice is many multiples of early choices. Given the random nature of the tiles popping up, the last round or two will likely determine the winner (because of AxB scoring), but control over the remaining tiles is wholly lacking. While this didn't actually annoy me on the first play, I think that after several more plays this issue will likely knock down my rating. Having said that, I think that, if one can get non-gamers to look beyond what seems like a school book excersize-theme of irrigating farmland,  this would be a fantastic gateway game! Easy to teach, a little nasty, a chance to feel all-powerful (as overseer), tension, bribes-- for a gamer or a non-gamer, that is one fun hour.

Simple rules, short playtime and a manageable setup make this a winner.  We introduced it to our in-laws who usually only play Settlers, and it was a big hit.  I enjoy the network-building aspect, and the collaboration.  But the best is the bribing!  

The overseer going to the player who bids least gives the game good balance.

Very, very good game! I liked it enough playing with the less-than-full rules that I bought it. However, playing with the full rules, it is quite cutthroat. I read that it is "a matter of how soon you get screwed!". A very apt description. I learned how to be mean from this game.

Similar to Aquadukt in more than one way, this a little bit less random and more auction. Quite hard to compare, but I think I like Aquadukt more - could be because it looks better. This game looks quite cheap (we didn't use the palm trees) and the using of paper money is not a good idea. It really slows the game down. But otherwise, the game plays in less than an hour and is relatively easy to teach. Ok, but nothing special.

RATING: 6
The concept here is great, and my only gripe is that the advantages from seating order are pretty serious, and feel to me like they determine the winner amongst skilled opponents. But if not taken TOO seriously, and enjoyed for its uniqueness, Santiago is a blast for 5 players. I'm happy to own it. UPDATE: combining a once around auction with everyone losing their bid is just wrong. Frustrating mechanic that somewhat spoils an otherwise brilliant and unique game.

The game seems to be popular, but I can't seem to figure out how to make the right decisions.  As it is now, it's a game with choices that frustrate me as what I think is a well-placed tile turns out to be a bone-headed placement.

This game is about cultivating and watering fields. To accomplish this, a number of tiles denoting various plantation types come into the game each round. The tiles are auctioned off such that each player gets one, and the tiles are then placed onto the game board along with an ownership marker that also indicates how plentiful the tile’s yield will be. Whoever bid the lowest in each round gets to be the canal overseer and decides where a canal will be built that round. The other players may make suggestions to help the canal overseer decide, and back up their suggestions with money. The final decision is always wholly up to the overseer, though.
\13\\13\
At the end of each round, players determine what the water supply situation looks like. Should a plantation not be sufficiently watered, its production drops dramatically; should it happen more than once, then that plantation may revert to fallow ground. At game’s end, naturally only the cultivated land counts. Each plantation is counted according to type – the bigger the better. But since the ownership markers play a role as well, the same plantation can give drastically different points for different players.

Mean and nasty in a hilarious way.   Maybe it was the way the theme was explained,  but you really got the feeling that everyone was completely self-serving, money-grubbing, plantation-killing...

Finally played again - still a nasty diplomatic game.  It is however very much a game of negotiations,  with a minor building component.

Cultivating crops like hot peppers, bananas, and sugar cane on a central arid planting field. Tile placement auction for area majority that centers around the shortage of water managed by bribing the irrigation boss. Played the Second Edition at Essen. How did I miss this game? Great fun. I love how the irrigation boss must pay over the highest bid if they want to place water to a non-proposed field. I also like games where cash equals victory points when valuing decisions!  A brilliantly simple game that evokes rich interactive bid and strategy decisions.

Haven't tried with the palm trees yet.

Played with 5 the only time I've played it.  Each auction offered numerous options for each player, with all positions of choosing tiles being attractive to some degree.  The bribing is a great mechanic, and is fun watching people add money to arbritary bids just to extract money from another player.

Just played with 5 again.  Not as impressed as earlier plays.  Too few options with this number, think it needs 4 players to work, IMO.

5+ plays and still look forward to getting this to the table more often.  Haven't experienced another game with this sort of bidding and bribery to get what you want. Thoroughly enjoyed the game and can't wait for more plays... There are several subtle decisions lurking beneath the simple surface -- when to pass/bid low to be the one to accept bribes, when to use your only guaranteed stream, whether to piggyback on another field or strike out on your own. Highly, highly recommended. If you've never played it with 5 yet, you haven't really seen what Santiago has to offer.

Santiago seems like a great game. I'm playing it on SpielByWeb, and while it's fun there, I think it must be much better in person. I see tons of potential for wheeling and dealing, not to mention backstabbing.

This is a really neat auction/bidding game with interesting spatial considerations.  Trying to balance getting good tiles in good locations while also bribing people to get water to them so they stay on the board and keeping money on hand since money is points is really interesting and unique!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice blend of auction, negotiation and area majority mechanisms.  However, I think the game suffers too much from player shortsightedness, especially those that aren't able to see beyond the immediate rewards.  For example, adding a tile to a fair sized plantation in which the leader already has the greater control is a poor play, since what you can gain is much less than what you would give to him in return, but some people just don't get that.  Furthermore, Santiago also tends to demand people to sacrifice themselves to stop someone from running away with the lead, whether by bidding or placing tiles that would cut off his ability to extend his fields, but who would like to be the one to take shoulder that responsibility?

Yes, Santiago is cutthroat and could potentially be very strategic, but it's also quite flawed in my opinion.

Need to play this more, as my one playing saw me in dead last.  I knew what was going on, just didn't know how to gain control to get big points.  Could be one of those "I like it but I suck at it" games.  We'll see.  Update: Have played it more, and have enjoyed it *much* more.  Elegant rules, wonderful player interaction (read: screwage abounds) make for a very good game. Update on the update: It's gotten better the more I've played it.  I will play this any time, it's that good.  Wonderfully elegant ruleset.  If you haven't picked this up already...what in the world are you waiting for???

With three players, anyway, this game was kind of relaxing for having two once-around auctions per turn.  I enjoy it.  Its manual, however, makes the game sound way more complex than it is, even though it's a fairly succinct manual.  This is certainly a game you can pick up by watching a turn or two, and being told the very simple end-game scoring.

It’s amazing how many simple mechanics put together can give a CLEVER and UNIQUE game. Lots of tension and negociations in every phase of the game. Santiago is similar to Bohnanza in a way that you have to help other players if you wanna put yourself in a good position, but there’s always an open door for a nasty move! It deserves a SOLID 8 and maybe a  9 depending how it works with only 3 players (will have to try it soon!).

A well-produced, cleverly-designed auction game.  It was actually quite a bit heavier than I expected: lots more rules and variability than I thought.  Still, not a "heavy" game, but really not light.  Solid core mechanic is innovative, but think-y.  Unfortunately, the box is too big for me to justify keeping this auction game.

RATING: 6
1st play: Very light, auction game. Cute art, excellent production value, and some interesting choices. I'm not sure how much depth it has, it will be interesting to see how non-gamers react to it.

2nd play: Meh - played it a second time and it was about the same as the first. I love the art and presentation, but the game is not for me.

Ok bidding game. I liked the dice bidding, but sometimes it felt like your options were a bit too constrained. And the rest of the game (besides the dice bidding) wasn't that interesting.

Unique for the pirate theme in that it's a fairly funky auction game, with some meeple placement if only to claim certain buildings that you can then use for your hidden Goal cards. Somewhat interesting how you can choose to place the different goods-colored corresponding dice on the bid track, and that those who 'pass' on bids also get to take some actions to trade for resources. Light/medium, there is definitely enough to think about that it goes a little beyond your average gateway Euros.

This has gone down really well with my family, I think it's a hidden gem and can't understand the low BGG profile.
Some people have suggested that there's not much beyond the auction, but what an auction! This mechanic is gorgeous, with players having to decide not just how much to bid but with which dice and with what end in mind, always bearing in mind the changing rewards for passing. Meanwhile you are also trying to guess what secret goals your opponents might be chasing with a possible view to blocking them. 
There's high player interaction, low down-time, lovely production quality (the pirate meeples even have a peg leg) and a clear rule book. The board looks a bit busy initially but you quickly find your way around it. I did wonder at first if the variable cloud rewards were a detail too far but have decided that they add a useful extra dimension, making some islands more valuable than others, increasing the likely competition for them and perhaps making it safer to try to secure shops on less rewarding but also less sought-after islands.
The pub is our favourite dilemma. Worth a massive 6 points, it's great if you can get it, but is it worth trying when it is likely that another player will "padlock" it if they get the chance? Likely, but not certain...sometimes taking the risk pays off.
All in all very pleased with Grog Island, there's nothing quite like it in my collection.

RATING: N/A
Grog Island is a light, auction, Euro game with an interesting dice mechanic for bidding. Each player can shift the dice around to increase the bid, but the dice must always be placed in descending (or equal) order which can make it a challenge to get the correct color die in the correct spot. There are ways to change the dice with parrot cards and there is a consolation for passing that generally gets better the longer you stay in the auction. The scoring falls a bit flat, but the overall game isn't bad. It's very light and I can't see playing this a ton, but I did enjoy it and think it would be best with 4 players.

Initial Impressions:
---------------------
This is the kind of auction game I like.  I really liked the addition of the Parrot cards, which allow you to manipulate the dice which are used for bidding.  The bidding mechanism in this one is different, although at the end of the day, this one kind of reminded me of Ra a bit.  While I have been interested in trying this one, I liked it more than I thought I would, and I do plan to hold on to it for awhile. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Awkward, clunky dice-driven pseudo-auction coupled with very bland grid-based scoring. So boring it's painful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Just not my sort of game. Probably good with kids, but I think too much going on for non-gamers.

The theme is unrelated to the mechanics and a bit too twee for me. I want a pirate game to feel, well, Piratey, this didn't at all other than the art. The dice auction is clever, but my overall feeling was it was all a bit dull, I have no desire to play it again.

Based on 1 play with 4 players:

Wow, for a light game it actually takes a bit to wrap your head around your plays here. After one game I'm kind of on the fence about it as a result.

So I'm a HUGE sucker for auction games and I do like the dice-driven system here, but to me there's something weird about an auction game where you're always bidding for the same thing. There's no shift in value of the lot. Even in games where you're bidding on the same lot every round (say, an auction to be first player etc.) there's usually there's other factors that influence how valuable the lot is to you at that moment - here you just know everyone always wants to win. It gives the game a weird certainty that robs it of some tension, IMO.

Maybe future changes will change my opinion on this, but I came away from my first play feeling surprisingly tepid toward Grog Island.

I honestly don't know why, but we just like this game. It plays very quick (with 2 players), the bidding mechanism is interesting and there actually are some strategies and decisions you have to make for your game! 

On another note, I do think that the designers could have added much more depth to the game. This might be a game that is predestined to be house-ruled/house-extended to add levels of depth to the gameplay!

The components are good quality, bright and engaging.

The dice-based bidding mechanic is excellent but everything beyond that falls a little flat.

The overwhelming majority of the points come from the secret objective cards. Players are dealt four of these at the beginning of the game and it is comparatively difficult to gain more during the game. This means that the end is a bit of a crap-shoot: you may think that you've done well on your goals and you're in a strong position, but if someone else happened to draw two of the same higher-scoring card they'll score more points for less effort - making most of your actions feel rather redundant.

[thing=163931][/thing] has such a clever auction mechanism.  You roll dice and use a number of them to construct a bid.  But the more dice you use the more goods you allow your opponents to take should your bid be successful.  It is so fiendishly clever.  Trouble is, the game which follows the auction is just a bit dull.  It's about getting majorities from your target cards.  Such a shame as the auction is a wonderful thing.

The game's heart is in the right place. The dice-auction mechanism is unique and the star of the show, the rest of the shell revolves around your standard fare point collecting. The point that suffers is the decision making. Often you are just playing the obvious choices laid out in front of you, and there are too many moments when you perform an action just because you are tasked to.

A relatively fast, easy-to-learn auction game with a bit of strategy to it.

Dice-based auction mechanism was interesting & playing time felt about right.

El juego es ligero pero con una buena dosis de entretenimiento. La parte m√°s interesante del juego es la subasta quedando la otra parte del juego algo lento. En general el juego es sencillo como para jugarse con la familia pues es r√°pido, si te gusta el batallar o pensar mucho la estrategia a seguir este no es tu juego pues aqu√≠ se requiere pensamiento t√°ctico.

Recomendaci√≥n: Mover las nubes igual que los barcos y en la nube donde no da nada tomar un recurso de la isla donde se encuentre. Con esto se mejora el juego y da m√°s opciones de planear algo m√°s y no solo depender de la subasta.

RATING: 5.5
There is really only a single mechanism in this game, and the auction mechanic that is present is quite unique and interesting, however the lack of other mechanics means that quickly this one feels dull and repetitive.

I like the dice auction mechanic with each colour die representing a particular good to your opponents and the opportunity to build upon a particular peninsula for you, but everything beyond that auction is very uninspiring.

The buildings on the peninsulas are all exactly the same, save for a symbol which may or may not score you points dependent upon the hidden goals you have drawn. There is a little variety in the peninsulas worth with randomly shuffled weather tiles offering bonuses for claiming the buildings of a certain peninsula in a certain turn, but over all very bland.

There is a set collection aspect with the goods you receive as compensation if you fail to win the bid but you need to collect 4 of the same type and as you collect them individually, this means you need to fail to win the auction 4 times.

Victory points earned during the game are irrelevant as such huge swings in victory points are achieved at game end with the goal cards. 

Traded in math trade (2016) for end of the world zombies role play book.

Grog Island is one of those games that have an interesting mechanism at the core but then fail to do anything worthwhile with it. In this case, the dice-driven auction that also rewards the losing bidders depending on what the bid is is the game's sole selling point. Drawing random goal cards and then trying to best match those cards with the actions you get works just fine but fails to excite. It probably doesn't help that the chosen theme doesn't come together at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Ein gef√§lliges Spielchen, indem sich der Vielspieler leicht unterfordert und der gehobene Familienspieler gut aufgehoben f√ºhlen wird. Die verniedlichte Piratenwelt mit dem zentralen, konsensf√§higen Bietmechanismus ist eine eigene, etwas abstrakte Idee, die sich im bekannten Rest nicht pr√§gend hervorhebt. GROG ISLAND macht nichts falsch und bleibt die soft geschliffene, ecken- und kantenfreie Mehrheitsf√§higkeit, die es sein m√∂chte.

Grog Island is a light game that still manages to present some interesting decisions, thanks to the auction mechanic that really is the pearl in the oyster. Without this the game would be very mediocre, but much like Tzolkin an innovative idea can compensate for some overly-familiar mechanics.

Rating after only play at essen. Smooth gameplay with the new stuff being the bidding system. You make a bid with the five common dice, and the mechanic is really interesting. The theme is really paper thin, but I really didn't care in this case, the gameplay is solid, smooth and rewarding. And passing in this game is really an alternative action. Like this a lot.

Update:

DON¬¥T play this with slow players as they overthink this one waaay to much, and the game slow to a crawl. Just play the game, and keep up the pace, and everything will be fine :-)...

A perfectly fine but ultimately unspectacular game that will be forgotten next year. The auction will turn off families, the gameplay doesn‚Äôt offer enough for gamers. While the idea to use several colored dice for bids is interesting, the actual gameplay didn‚Äôt keep that promise with bids soon ending up at the same high value each round (10-13) as it is strictly better early on to win an auction while higher bids won‚Äôt be possible due to the limited total amount of money. The difference between players will be in the single placement of a meeple or one better scoring card.

Grog Island is a colourful and fun area control game with dice! It's well-designed and surprisingly balanced. I like how the pips on the dice correlate to your gold count, and how that forces you to make tough decisions, being that money is critical in this game. The parrot cards add some nice randomness, and the treasure cards add just the right amount of doubt. A great game, one that could probably be used as a gateway.

it's not a fantastic awesome game but it's a very interesting and cool game... very interesting way to do an auction and the players that don't win the auction all get something has they pass, they get the goods that are being used by the current winning auction bid and then they can choose one of the available ships to perform an action.

Very cool and interesting decisions to be made in a game that plays fast...

One minor nitpick, the middle island is supposed to be "orange" like the color of the die but it looks more brown than orange, check the photo:

Despite the interesting mechanism of utilizing dice to bid and having the freed-up spots give those who pass resources, I found the game to be incredibly boring. There is a distinct runaway leader problem, and the way the game plays out is almost predetermined. I also dislike how you have to spend resources if you pass. Not being forced to do this would make the game noticeably better, especially for those who want to save up for bigger payoffs. Lastly, the fact that hidden scoring makes up for at least 90% of your overall points is pretty lame. At least in something like Kingdom Builder you have a general idea of how well everyone is doing. I just found the game to be very mundane. There are some interesting ideas here, but it doesn't come together as well as it should.

The weird dice auction scheme is tricky to figure out while reading the rulebook but instantly makes sense once you actually get to play. There is some competition over getting the houses needed for the secret scoring cards but otherwise the gameplay is rather repetitive and uninspiring. Usefulness of the parrot cards is also questionable and varies wildly.

Fine auction game, maybe a small catch the leader problem if someone blows all cash on one auction and then has to spend several turns passing.

This game is good fun. The innovative auction mechanic is solid and good fun. The way that the island occupations work is neat and the game looks great. I really like this now and after a few plays now I think there is a little bit more to it than one might think.

Looking forward to playing this again.

Grog Island uses a clever dice-based auction mechanism in which five different color dice are rolled each turn. The numbers on the dice determine the possible bid amounts, which the colors of the dice determine both where the auction winner can build his buildings, as well as what people who drop out of the auction receive as compensation. On his turn, the bidder selects any number of dice, provided that the sum of the pips is greater than the previous bid. The auction winner can build buildings in areas corresponding to the two dice with the largest values, and the people who drop out receive goods tiles of all the colors that were part of the winning bid. The goal of the game is to try to achieve hidden goal cards, the most valuable of which require you to build in specific locations on the game board. I thought that the auction in this game was clever and innovative, but the game itself didn‚Äôt really grab me. The goal cards in particular were very swingy because some were very obviously better than others (and this was exacerbated by the fact that a second identical goal card could not even be played).

I had a lot more fun with this than I thought I would. I like my set collection games quick and breezy. Grog Island does this well. It is very light, but I really liked the dice rolling mechanic for bidding and the illustrations made the game feel very piratey and fun. One for the family.

The dice auction is easily the best/most interesting part of this game. Very unique and balanced the folow of resources beautifullyl. I can't say I'm as much of a fan of the area control and card scoring. Seems like whoever draws the score cards with the least competition will likely win.

I played this when it first came out and I wasn't thrilled with it.  Played it again 2 years later, and wow, fun game!  There are interesting choices, especially with the dice bidding placement, and we don't even really like bidding in games.  This one is quite different.  I like the secret objective goals too.  

Graphics and component quality are excellent.  The rule book is excellent.  Nothing in the game ever came up that was not addressed in the rules.

Works fine for 2 players, but better with more.  Recommended.

Got in trade. I love the auction-bidding system here.. one of the best I've seen till now. Thr artwork is beautiful, great components and not too many moving pieces. Very elegant gameplay and good lenght, basically right up my alley. More to come after a few plays.

2plays:

Tentative rating for now. The auction system is probably my favorite of any game that I have played, as I already suspected. I like that the player who passes gets something worthy. Sometimes passing could even be your best play, depending on your end game goals. I have only played 2p and it's very good.. But I suspect the game will shine with full count. That is almost always the case with auction games, and this one is lightning quick so full player count will not drag it down. The components are stellar, the artwork is phenomenal and the mechanisms are elegant. There's a lot of randomness in the treasure cards, the parrots and the endgoals.. But I don't mind it because it's all so lovely and quick. Will stay in the shelf family.


I put in the work that I needed to, had fun in my two games. But someome wanted it more than me, so I let it go. More games to try out.

Don't judge a game by its cover! The dice auction mechanic is excellent. Hidden goals are right up my alley as well. Disadvantage: there's a considerable possibility of screwage towards players who have few money at hand: always bid with only one die so that they only get a single token when passing. (Partially their own fault though - having too less money at hand is often a mistake, unless you won an excellent item in the previous round maybe). Also, the game ends sooner than one might think in the beginning. What's funny as well is that building doesn't get you any points per se (as in so many other games). In our first game I won having built only 4 buildings!

Light/family auction game where players make bids by combining the 5 dice rolled that turn, each of which corresponds to one of the islands/colours (e.g., use the orange 3 and the green 2 to make a bid of 5). Passing allows a player to collect goods tokens based on the previous player's bid (e.g., in this case, an orange grog token and a green coconut) and also visit one of the merchant ships. Winning the bid allows that player to take ownership of buildings on the islands.

Points are scored almost entirely based on goal cards, e.g. 1 point for every coconut or 3 points for each "anchor" building owned.

The auction mechanism is quite engaging, but the rest of the game is less interesting. The ability to overbid without severe penalty is a promising twist that ultimately adds little to the game (compared to, say, Yunnan, where it is a painful strategic decision).

The pirate theme is embarrassingly pasted-on.

Points are just calculable enough that min-maxing players could quite easily drag out the game, which is unfortunate as it is likely wasted effort: there is significant luck in the dice, the treasure cards and particularly the goal cards. 

Reasonably good for what it is but way outside my wheelhouse: minimal spatial element, no development arc, too light, too random and too long for its weight.

tl;dr: perfectly adequate
This game has a somewhat novel auction mechanism involving colored dice. The auction winner can do certain actions based on what color die is in which position after the auction. On the other hand there is also a nice incentive to pass early on auctions.
The majority of your points will come from scoring cards, mostly based on what buildings you build.
It's a nice little family friendly strategy game. It does have a novel mechanism, but it's not spectacular in any way. So, it's perfectly adequate for a number of plays, but I don't see this getting tonnes of play.

Initial rating: 6.5/10

I'd heard coming in to this game that the bidding mechanism was really interesting, but the 'back end' was a little tedious - in the same way that Tzolkin is. Alas, it appears to be entirely accurate. The bidding and passing - and the goods collected in the process is really interesting and I actually quite like the hidden bonus money so that you can never quite predict how much people can bid (I'd actually like to see that be more common in the game). Alas, the buying up of shops, the goal cards and the variably useful parrot cards all turned me off.

There's 60% of a really good game in here.

The auction is a nice mechanism. But the game feels overcrowded and lacks in overview.
Would play again and rating might rise if a second play would feel less chaotic.
Luck factor certainly there but so many random elements, that bad luck should usually distributed rather even among the players.

Players help their shipload of pirates prepare for retired life on the five colored peninsulas of Grog Island.  The standout feature in this game is the auction mechanic using combinations of dice pips from a starting roll to outbid one another. The color of the dice will determine on which peninsula to invest. Ghost pirates, parrots, peg legs, treasure chests. Trade goods of lemons, coconuts and fish in the market. Steeped in theme, light area control and set collection gateway dice auction game.

There aren‚Äôt many games with a bidding system that works wit two players, but this game has a system that actually works. Of course the bids will be lower then with three or four players, but it can become more tactical with two then with more players. If a player passes on the bidding he‚Äôs also rewarded, and that‚Äôs what it makes interesting. Often you want to loose on a bidding, because at the moment it‚Äôs more interesting for you to gain the reward for passing. Still this game will be best with three or four players, but it‚Äôs nice with two.

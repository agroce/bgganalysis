RATING: 6
Fair dice roller that felt too random for my tastes.  The winner was....the person whose board, substantially coincidentally, was a better match for the rolls that were rolled by all the players.  I suppose if the game were played more competitively, after each roll, the rolling player would examine every players boards, calculate which player is presently winning, then target them with a re-roll.

RATING: 6
Not much fun with six - you have too little control and looking to see what everyone else wants is tedious.  I suspect this might be a very fine (travel) two-player game, where you have more control over rerolling the dice and can easily see what your opponent wants.

This game has a feeling like Qwixx. Not that strange because it's a game from the same publisher and author

I love the recent spate of roll & write games, so this one went over relatively well.  One person can get pretty far ahead of others, however, based on the luck of the roll.  I prefer Qwixx or Noch Mal to this, but wouldn't mind playing this one occasionally.

RATING: 5.7
Each player has to fill a scorecard showing 5 rows of coloured dice. 6 dice of different colours are thrown. If the active player is not satisfied with the outcome, he or she can rethrow the dice, except for the ones showing a one. Then all players can fill the dice on the top row of their scorecard. Per colour the value has to be equal or lower than the value indicated on the scorecard. When the value is equal bonus points are gained, 6 perfect hits delivering 21 points. When it is impossible to fill out a value, the left most open die in the row has to be crossed out. One can only proceed to the next row in the turn following the turn in which a row was completed. The total of the values filled out and the bonus points for the perfect hits (per row) gives your final score.

I've made and played a print and play version, and Twenty One fills the gap between Qwinto and Qwixx. Qwinto has much more in terms of strategy and experience, while Qwixx is overly simple. Twenty One falls right in the middle. There are enough decisions to keep play interesting, but not enough to bog it down. Though I still prefer Qwinto, this is another interesting use of the communal dice mechanic.

Another small dice game in the vein of Qwixx and Qwinto but this one feels like you are quite a bit more dependent on "good" rolls (where what's good for one player typically isn't for another). Fewer choices and high bonuses for exact results. It's still very quick so the tax isn't too onerous but doesn't seem like an improvement over the earlier games in the line.

Benndorf continues to roll out the bingo dice success formula of Qwixx. Twenty One is ok with a few decisions to be taken but in the end a few lucky rolls of matching dice dominate everything else. No reason to choose this over one of the other incarnations of the formula.

Ein Würfelspiel. Jeder Spieler würfelt reihum und darf wenn er an der Reihe ist beschliessen den Wurf zu wiederholen. Spätestens den zweiten muss er nehmen und alle Spieler müssen mindestens einen Würfelwert auf seinem Block markieren oder im schlimmsten Fall wegstreichen. Wenn die erste Reihe voll ist darf mit der zweiten weitergemacht werden, usw.
Sobald ein Spieler alle Reihen gefüllt hat endet das Spiel und der mit den meissten Punkten gewinnt.
Man kann durchrushen um viele Werte (vermutlich nicht die Besten/Höchsten) eintragen und das Spiel schnell beenden bevor die Anderen punkten oder man nimmt sich nur die Höchstwerte eines Wurfes und ist damit langsamer.

Run of the mill dice game with only very small twists.  Roll five different color dice and try to score by choosing at least one die that is the same or lower than those depicted on your unique scoresheet.  One reroll allowed.  Play until five rows filled.  That is it.  A passtime.  Played and won at Zuiderspel '17.

OK roll-and-write game from the designers of Qwixx but I think the luck of the dice is much higher in this one. I prefer Qwixx but the kids do like this a lot especially when they score a hit. Also there might be a strong first player advantage but only time will tell.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]I'm a huge fan of roll and write games and Qwixx is one of my favorites, so I was really looking forward to playing Twenty One. Unfortunately I don't have much positive to say about it, I found Twenty One to be devoid of much choice and extremely luck dependent... even for a dice game. Instead of giving a rules overview I'll mention the design choices that really killed this game for me. 

First you can only score one row at a time which makes the game much less dynamic than Qwixx. Yes there is a push your luck element because of this constraint, but luck has more to do with the winner than any choice you will make. Second you only get one, very limited, re-roll attempt. If you choose to re-roll you have to keep any 1's rolled, but that's it, you can't choose to keep any other dice. This exacerbates the next problem I have with the game, other players can check off any number of dice on their sheets that you've rolled. And since everyone is filling in a different sheet there will be many turns where your roll benefits your opponent(s) more than you and nothing about that feels satisfying. 

After my first play we were all convinced I got rules wrong, specifically that you could check off any number of dice on another players turn [i](which is correct)[/i]. We all felt like there was almost no strategy in the game and the push your luck element just wasn't fun. Balloon Pop is a much better push your luck game and Qwixx is by far the deeper roll and write game. I just can't see playing this game over other roll and write games.

My personal rankings for roll and write games that use standard d6 dice are:  Qwinto -> Qwixx -> Rolling America -> far down -> Twenty One.[/i]

A good game in the same style of Qwinto and Qwixx. It's a different take but still good fun. Another nice one to take with on trips.

This might be a fun interludium, but it has nothing to do with outmanoeuvring the opponents. You might play better than your fellow opponents, but that is absolutely no guarantee for a win...

RATING: 6
Sort of Qwixx-game, but different enough. After only one play I would however prefer Qwixx.

Edit 11/04/2017: Played it 3 times now and this game seems to be more luck dependant = can cause more frustrations then Qwixx or Qwinto, so lowered rating.

RATING: 7.5
More dice awesomeness. Another new dice game I must have and this is more in the vein of qwixx. If you like dice games and own them all like me, you will need to pick this up. If you don't like dice then move along.

Mentioned in a subscribed blog, and as I'm on the hunt for a simple addition game intrigued if this dice version would be a good candidate. From the video review, it is a roll and write mechanism thankfully not at the complexity of others as it is a contract of marking off on a sheet a die roll on or below the printed die value. You get bonus kicker pts for marking off exactly the value required. And for goodness this is a simultaneous die rolling to maintain pace and interest.

RATING: 7.5
From the designer of Qwixx (OK) and Qwinto (better) comes Twenty One (best): a mini-Bingo-with-bonuses where agency is achieved by having you weigh up the benefit of a ticking off a box or two now and keeping up a good 'pace' in the game (relative to the other players) or hoping for a better roll next turn. It works well, is quick, and has kept all the players so far surprisingly engaged.

We like Qwixx, prefer Qwinto and would put this third of the three. There don’t seem to be that many decisions to take, take a low number or don’t. Most of our games are won by someone who has a couple of lucky roles - which don’t help the other players. It’s an ok filler.

Do not own--played for first time with friend's copy.  Made me think of Smash Up a bit in terms of acquiring the Ruins cards by "breaking a base".  Multiple ways to score points, so people won't get totally locked out and left behind.  I liked the graphics.  Turns are quick, so less down time.  Overall, a fun title that has replay value.

The game has very similar mechanics to my own game, Dark Minions, but I believe Unearth is the better game.  The Wonders add a valuable and diverse element to scoring and it appears the mechanisms have been well thought out.

Our table of four enjoyed the game and I'm very much looking forward to playing again.

The graphics may borrow a bit too much from iOS/Android Monument Valley but that is a minor complaint when considering how attractive the graphics actually are.

First play - 7.5 rating

Unearth is a bend-your-luck game of dice placement and set collection. It plays in under an hour with 2-4 players. Each player leads a tribe of Delvers, represented by five dice (3 six-sided, 1 four-sided, and 1 eight-sided). Players take turns rolling and placing dice in an attempt to claim Ruins.

The game's elegant core mechanic is accessible to players of all skill levels. High rolls help players claim Ruins, while low rolls help players collect Stones. This opens two paths to victory: claiming sets of Ruins or using Stones to build Wonders. Delver cards help you affect your dice rolls or dice in play, and Wonders can grant abilities that impact the late game.

I absolutely love the aesthetic of this game, it kind of reminds me of Fez or maybe a little hyper light drifter. The game itself is solid, there is a bit of hand/dice management, and while there aren't a TON of interesting decisions it certainly remains engaging and doesn't overstay its welcome.

4 player game, was assured it was better at 3. Whole game feels futile. Can't accomplish anything really. Cards that are there to mitigate the die roll, well, don't really. I'd rather a roll and write game over this one.

Cute and light, but let's not lie, I picked up this game because it's an art object in itself. The box is also the best storage solution that I've seen in an original box.

How's the game itself? I haven't played it enough times to say definitely. Pretty fun but I couldn't say the game has a ton of strategy per se, or that it has a ton of replay value. 

I really want to like it though. The graphic design is just so pretty.

I wanted to like this game since it is really pretty to look at.  Ruins felt overpowered versus stones and delver cards in my limited plays, so I didn't feel like I had incentive to interact with other players.  I'll pass if this hits the table again.

First off, the game is gorgeous.  I am very much reminded of Monument Valley on the ipad.  That's the whole reason I stopped at the booth at Origins to check it out.  It sucks you in.  

In the end, though, I have to agree with what TheOriginalJwoo stated earlier.  There is far too much that hinges on dice rolls without alternative actions.  It's one thing if you roll and then decide what to do with the potentially bad roll.  But, to have to base your strategy, deciding ahead of the roll, on an unknown and then deal with the hands of fate afterwards is too big a gap to bridge.  Add to that, the frustration with working on a larger value card and seeing four of your dice, all less than 3, get aced out by one person who comes along and rolls a six and takes the card.  Yes, I would get delve cards, but those are just second place ribbons, no one wants that.

About halfway through the game, I started to realize I had no chance due to poor rolls and I lost interest.  Shame, but I doubt I'd ever seek out another play of this.

[ESP] Simpático el juego, pero no memorable. Lanzas dados para tratar de obtener las cartas objetivo que hay al centro. Si el dado es 1 2 y 3 podrías obtener una piedra qué te permitirá construir una ruina. Es un premio de consuelo bastante importante. Cuando se alcanza el valor requerido por una carta objetivo el jugador que haya colocado el dado más alto ahí gana la carta. Los demás jugadores que tengan presencia reciben una carta de efecto como premio de consuelo.
En resumidas cuentas mecánicas muy familiares sin nada nuevo. Podría jugarlo nuevamente pero seguramente preferiría otro tipo de juego.

Unearth is a clever game of dice placement, where players compete to explore and unearth ancient ruins.

The core mechanic is quite simple: each turn a player must choose a ruin card and roll one of his/her dice (one d4, three d6, one d8), then place that dice on the card. If the roll is low (1, 2 or 3) the player gets a stone (6 connected stones grant an objective worth some victory points at the end of the game), while higher rolls allow the player to have a shot at claiming the ruin card (each ruin has a target number: when the sum of dice on it reach that number, the card is claimed by whoever has the highest valued due on it). Sets of claimed ruin cards also grant points at the end of the game.

The game moves at a brisk pace, and it is somewhat engaging, while a bit on the dry side: it is definitely abstract (the theme is... thin), and perhaps lacks some sort of narrative arch (you do exactly the same from the beginning to the end).
I didn't try it with just 2, but I am quite sure it doesn't scale well to that player count.
Anyway, it is fast (under an hour), and it should at least give a few plays before becoming a bit stale.

one die at a time just to give it more of a tactile kind

Another 'I bought it because I like the art' game. I have seen several videos reviewing this game. I do not really like a dice-rolling game, but after seeing the unusual art it has, I decided to buy it. It turns out that this game has become my sole party game for now. The other members like it, a lot, because it does not necessarily need the time consuming strategic thinking. The only thing you need to do is throw the dice (and have a good luck; in the end, it is a dice game). I would say this game will be something that you play once in a month just because your head might explode if you decide to run on that abstract game once again.

Really enjoying this game! Combines the break-point card winning aspect (similar to Smash Up) with dice mechanics. Choice of d8, d6, or d4 alter probabilities of doing different things (d8 for winning ruins or d4 for nabbing stones). Cards help balance luck, and even poor die rolling is balanced with the construction of ruins. I think there are ways that the game could be improved, but overall really fun. Graphic design is really nice. Insert is a little iffy, but not bad.

Playing Time
- So far have had a really good time playing it - ages 7+, first few plays took an hour, 25 min is a very good estimation with 2 people after a few plays.

Luck/Strategy
- There are enough strategic choices, based on probability of success--and as with anything sometimes the plans don't work.   Different sized dice + delver cards + wonder point target allow you to maximize the likelihood of your outcome.  You absolutely can significantly impact "luck" of the dice by making good choices and planning ahead.

Components
- Cards are good quality--though I wish the Delver cards were a little higher grade (more like TTR).
- Dice are good, and a lot of fun to have D6, D8 and D4 options in each color--and fun to have different names for each to help get into the theme a bit (D8="Overseer"- it has 7s and 8s to throw around; D6="Grunt" - they are just bulking up the count (mostly~without delver modification); D4="Gatherer" - the main reason for this one is to pick up the "Stones" you need for your wonders).
- Some people have found building out the wonder tableau challenging without a visual guide--but they figure it out eventually. 
- Bag for the "Stones" is a good quality, clearly intending to be used quite a bit (and it is used a lot during the game)
- There is more setting up than you would expect; matching wonders to the wonder cards is a bit of a puzzle since the images look similar
- It is fun to have 3 different sized card decks and they all feel appropriately sized for their importance in the game (Ruins are the biggest, Wonders are the next, followed by Delvers)
- The insert is incredible.  Everything has a place, and it fits with plenty of room to spare.  putting it away in the insert makes setup easier the next time you play (they should give whoever designed the insert a raise)
- The Ruin cards have different colors, but "gray"/"light purple" and "dark purple" aren't that different... it made calling out the Ruin you were rolling for difficult... until I saw online a demo with the cards called by location:  Island, Forest, Mountain, Cavern and Desert.  So much easier now.
  
Gameplay
- We've had 1 tie out of 10 games (2 player: 53-53), which was resolved by the City of Gold having the highest claim value (21).
- When the City of Ash has shown up at the end of the age, (2 times so far) we have groaned and laughed.   A good and fun addition.  Also a place where Forlorn (Delver Card) is really good to hang on to.
- Playing multiple delvers at once is a very interesting wrinkle -- reroll all of your dice is a great way to quickly build up a wonder.
- We have all had a lot of fun with it -- and it is hard not to play a second game once the first is over.
- I wish the game could play up to 6 people (without changing the feel), but so far have played with 2, 3 and 4... the game feels balanced in each case.   For 2 player you remove 10 Ruins to start -- but by the time the End of Age card is showing, you kind of wish you hadn't taken so many out.
- Clever placement of the Delver cards make a significant impact on the game.  We have been playing a lot with the Delver cards face-up to help get a feel for what they can do.   Some of them are possible to interpret in different ways, particularly in combination.
- It is amazing how once you have built 2 wonders, you almost want the game to slow down a bit (rolling low) so you can build out the 3rd and get the 3 wonder bonus
- The game is not hard to understand, and all of the parts of it feel like they "fit" together into this one experience.  Nothing feels tacked on.

Scoring
- It is hard to tell (most of the games we've played) who is going to win by looking at what is showing.  The hidden Ruin card at the beginning helps with scoring multiples along with the potential bonus for one of each kind, as do the variable points for some of the named wonders (because it would be hard to count and keep it in your head during the game), the Greater and Lesser wonder variable points, etc.
- Once the game ends, it is really easy to add up points.  The scoring feels a bit like 7 Wonders but has a lot less complexity--while still seeming to reward a bunch of different in-game actions/strategies.
- So far we've had people win with wonders, win without, start with a ruin strategy and after getting one of each moving into wonders, etc.  all seems to work well.

We have really been enjoying the game a lot.  It is super fast to teach but is interesting enough to play multiple times in a row--especially once you get over the initial "learning pace" game.

Color palette is appealing and it has a nice use of d4 to d8.  It is a game on constellation prizes.  Lose anything in the game and get something for you trouble.  Cool to have advantages of rolling big or small numbers and they can seed different strategies.

I love how the last card you do not want but still have to roll and place dice.

I often find games that do clever things with dice appealing, but all too rarely find them actually enjoyable to play. This one has some neat dynamics (and is gorgeous to boot), but the game-as-a-whole felt too chaotic for me (even allowing for it being a game with dice). I suspect I'd have preferred 2-3p: more time for Wonders' powers to be relevant, more agency in the delving contests.

I'm not a big fan of smash up because of the unforseen take that nature of it, and I don't want to put in the time to learn the advantages of each deck.

This game is smash up with dice where you first declare the card you're going to try for, THEN roll the die (unless you have a special card That breaks this rule).

The way this works takes the unpredictable nature of smash up, remove the silly fun of smash up, then add more random and not as silly fun of a theme.

If you like smash up or any game where you roll for success, you might enjoy this. But if you fall more on the perfect information side of games, it might be too luck dependent for you.

Edited due to rules errors in our first game. Remaining remarks still stand after initial play.

I suppose I can see the appeal of the game for folks who enjoy games like Century, since they both have the essence of quickly gaining resources (or in this case properly rolled dice) to purchase a victory trophy before your opponent can. The dice rolling can of course be frustrating and the game does a decent job of balancing a low roll here and there, I just didn't feel terribly engaged while playing it. The side game of making colored Q-Bert holes felt tacked on. The trophy card art was done well, but the graphics in other parts of the game (wonder tiles and effect cards) were dismal.

In the end it felt like a lazy attempt to add another entry in a barn full of similar played games.

We bought this game because the setup looked simple. 

Then the setup turned out to be more complex than we anticipated - d'oh! 

But now that we've played it through once, it doesn't seem complicated at all, and I look forward to playing it again! 

The turns are very fast; you take one action and then you're done. (Technically, the turns are two-phase, but in our first game, we didn't end up using the first phase all that often; it's very situational.) Keeping it moving from turn to turn helps a lot, I think. 

The game is surprisingly beautiful, for all it's made up of abstract art and Ninjalinos.

This one is interesting but restrictive, the delver cards having to be played before you roll makes them pretty worthless as the powers on them are mostly reacting i.e granting you rerolls etc.

I do like that you have to declare where you are rolling for beforehand and that there is a compensation mechanic for your low rolls however the stones/monuments are simply too slow to build as a viable strategy and the points from these are far too low to be competitive, which leaves unearth as a rather unsatisfying race for good dice rolls to claim the right colour ruins for your set.

Jeff Jones says we played with a "variant", which I think actually means we played it incorrectly. Jeff's variant had the winner of the card take it with the value of all your dice added together but the rules state that the winner of the card is the person with the highest value die. Honestly, after I learned that, I preferred Jeff's variant.

The game is fine for a dice-chucker. High values are good for winning cards and low values are good for getting hexes. Hexes allow you to get monuments but I found that these were typically only won toward the end of the game so there was maybe only a couple turns where you could feasibly activate their powers. Greater & Lesser Monuments provided more VP in the long run. Sets of card colors also won more points than did having one card of each color. 

All in all, sort of mindless, random fun but it is limited fun.

RATING: 6
The best things about the game are the artwork and the hexagonal tile-laying mechanism. Very abstract design, and took surprisingly long to explain since there was no theme to help reason about the mechanics.

Otherwise, meh. The game is inoffensive, but the mechanics are not super-engaging. It was an odd design choice to require players to choose the Ruin card to target before rolling the die—this is pure output randomness and eliminates what would likely be the most interesting choice in the game. The same can be said about the order of playing Delve cards, which occurs before rolling a die. It just results in so much gambling rather than interesting choices.

The game wisely does provide a consolation prize when the random die roll doesn't work out (i.e. a future Delve card), but the value of this consolation quickly diminishes as the game goes on, so it ultimately still feels like a dead turn.

Also, for 4 players, the game goes very quickly and it's over before players can really build up their tableau. It seems that the component count was tuned for fewer than 4 players. In such a case, set collection is a less-than-ideal scoring choice.

Though minor, the game could benefit from a small board (there is a slot for one in the insert), or at least provide named tokens to help players refer consistently to the Ruin cards. In our play, we used an ad-hoc mishmash of ways to refer to the Ruin cards; not a big deal and it was workable, but annoying since we had to confirm more often.

It's not surprising to me that this game is published by the Boss Monster publisher. That game is also pretty meh, with suboptimal mechanics, and between the two games, it doesn't feel like the publisher sets a high bar for game development.

The worst indictment you can give a game is that it is boring, but boring this game is. Pick a die, roll it, put it on a card, hope your turn order falls such that you can claim the card to set collect? Great art does not a great game make. Easy to teach, but not compelling in any way.

Lowered rating after additional play. Unearth has a core of being interesting. Choosing to allocate your die in a push-you-luck manner on a location is fun. The risk/reward works well, and I like that if you roll poorly, rewards still come. That said, there is no sense of accomplishment in any decisions. The best moves are simply getting a high roll on one 8-sided die. The delver cards and hexagon tableau also slow what should be a fast game of choose location, then roll into a much slower affair. There are some good ideas here, but together, they all make each other worse.

I had really hoped that the gameplay would be a bit more interesting, as the graphic design is top-notch. But there really doesn't seem to be a lot of meaningful decisions in this game. I know it's a dice game, but still it would be far more interesting if you could select where to place your die *after* you rolled it. For family entertainment it's ok, I guess.

Ok, first the art is great. Unique color palette added to the minecraft style art work. Love the art. However the game play is too much luck. It's too easy for someone's lucky roll to take the card you've been working for. There are multiple paths to victory but you really have little control over that.

Unearth's dice placement mechanics are quite interesting.  I like how both low and high rolls are valuable and give different benefits.  Lot of luck, but the delver cards help mitigate some of it.  Overall, a fun game, but probably too light for me.

Unearth is an extremely enjoyable (and very addictive) set collecting game that is extremely easy to learn and teach but contains a rewarding amount of strategy for what appears on the surface to be a random press your luck/take that game.  

In it your goal is to collect ruins, each of which is one of 5 different colors.  To do so, each player starts with 3 D6s, a D4, and a D8, and for each player's turn, they choose to roll a single die on a single ruin (some cards you can get will give more flexibility).  Each ruin has a number on it and once the total pips on the dice on a given ruin exceed the number on the ruin, the person with the highest single die on that ruin wins it.  You get more points for winning sets of the same colored ruin.  And if you have a penchant for rolling low, never fear as a 3 or lower wins you a resource that if you get enough of can also give you powerful wonders and a competitive number of points.  As well, losing dice on a given ruin will happen to give you some additional cards that give bonuses to rolls and can turn around a game in your favor.

Again, this may seem to be based on random die rolls, but the more you play this, the more you understand how large a role math and probability play in this game, as well as your awareness of the other players' sets and points.  Focus too much on a single goal or color, and everyone becomes aware of it and will block your path.  Don't focus enough on any given task and you likely will be playing from behind all game.  And most games come down to just a few points separating the winner from everyone else.  

This is a very balanced game that your whole family can play and enjoy and also will lead to extremely competitive and fun matches for experienced gaming groups as well.  And with a gameplay time of about 30 minutes, this is a game that as soon as it ends, everyone I've played with wants to immediately play again.  I cannot recommend this game enough.  A solid 9/10 for a rather simple concept.

RATING: 7
Decent little game. Love the artwork. Have only played with two. Seems like it would scale a bit better with three or four since there would be more competition for the different ruins. At two we seemed to run out of dice quite often and had to keep re-rolling ones up from existing ruins. Still, it's a pretty cool game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not sure why I thought this would be a good game. Brotherwise games are 0-2 with me now.

This game has few decisions, and almost nil control over your play. Delver cards allow you some mitigation, but since you must play them before you roll, they are just as luck driven as the dice. Example: I play a card that let's me add 2 to a D6, I roll a 6. Not helpful, burned a card, and didn't get a stone.

Never before have I rolled so well in a dice game, 4s on a D4, 6s on D6, 8s on D8. I was on a streak! Downside to that is the game incentivizes low rolls! And high rolls feel like a lost turn.

Oh well, It's beautiful, but it's meh.

By looking at the rules it seems that this game has enough strategy. Surely, there is some luck, but not too much. After playing the game, it appears that there is too much luck after all. Of course, the dice always give you something useful: either a stone or a good value on the rune, however the dice decide everything in this game. You cannot do that much if the dice doesn't roll as you have planned. Maybe I simply do not like dice in any game?

Pagal taisykles atrodo, kad žaidimas turi pakankamai strategijos. Tiesa, sėkmės yra, bet ne per daug. Na o pažaidus susidarė įspūdis, kad sėkmės jame tikrai per daug. Taip, išmesti kauliukai visais atvejais šį bei tą duoda - arba akmenį, arba didelį skaičių runoms rinkti, bet kauliukai šitame žaidime yra viskas. Ir ne tiek daug gali padaryti, jeigu jie nekrinta taip, kaip esi suplanavęs. Gal man tiesiog kauliukai apskritai nepatinka?

This is a great game. Haven't played with 2 but 3 worked great and I'm looking forward to playing with 4. Art is wonderful, theme is great (although a little pasted-on), mechanics work fluidly together, and managing your dice is great fun. Plus, almost no matter what you roll you get something. I do think with a little homebrewing the wonders can come into play earlier and have more of an impact on the game but overall this is a fantastic game and definitely a keeper for me. Hoping for an expansion.

Fun and easy light game. Feels a bit like smash up, you are placing your tribe members (dice) on different ruins. Once the dice on the ruins are at the level required they are claimed based on who has the highest single dice value. If you roll a 1, 2, or 3, you get a mineral. If you gather the correct minerals in the right pattern you get to earn a "wonder". At the end whomever has most points wins the game. Simple to pickup and learn. Takes about 45 min to play.

This game was fun but had some hiccups.  Don't get me wrong, I'd still buy it if the price were a bit lower.  There is strategy involved.  It irks me when people complain about the luck of die rolls.  That's the strategy, as in what will you do with your next roll based on how this one turned out, based on how your opponents' rolls turned out.  Do you pursue stone collection or card completion?  There are crucial in-game decisions to make.  As for the rest of it, the artwork is stellar, the components are good and the gameplay goes fairly quickly.  Still, the theme is very lost on me.  I didn't feel like I was really excavating anything.  I was just rolling dice to get pictures (cards).

It's your run of the mill dice placement game with some interesting artwork.  My main issue is the lack of mitigation, thus your rolls can completely screw you over.  Unearth tries to introduce mechanics where rolling low can benefit you in one way while rolling high is still a benefit albeit in a different way.  However, I still didn't feel much agency was involved throughout the game.  You simply go with the roll of the dice and the decision making wasn't as interesting as other filler games like For Sale or meatier 30-60 minute dice games like Roll for the Galaxy.

Also, tip for publishers, if you are going to use colors as "suits" in your game, attach an icon to it.  I had to double take a few times in Unearth since I wasn't sure if the colors matched and I'm not even colorblind!

Have now played this once in a boardgame cafe and can confirm it's just as pretty as it looks on the box. The mechanics are interesting - the balance between jewel collection, 'delver' cards, monuments and ruins leads to some interesting decisions. I would need to play more to get a sense for how balanced or well-executed it is, but on first play it struck me as very original and that's refreshing. I would probably still buy it if I saw a good price.

This is a perfectly inoffensive game that would be decent as a gateway for non-gamers. Kudos for using d4's and d8's.

In the end, it's too luck based given the other mechanisms in play.  It seems like it should have some strategy , but dice luck plays far too much of a role, no pun intended.  There are tactical decisions, but they are usually very obvious, and rely on luck either in your roll or in the use of the cards which you have to play before rolling.

I've only played once, so this is really a preliminary review (which I don't generally do), but I feel like I've seen what the game has to offer.

The cards you get for losing out on a region card is a smart mechanism, but we had a couple of rules questions regarding them as there are small, but important, gaps in their interactions.  The game needed a rules editor because there was no reason something this light should have so much questions.  After one

I'm not sure anyone would be talking about this if it wasn't for the fantastic art, which is voxel Minecraft by way of Monument Valley.  Note that there are a lot of similarities between this and Dark Minions.  Less take-that than Smash Up, but way more luck.

A very basic dice game that feels like a distant cousin to Dark Minions with how area control and points work. The one mechanism I found noteworthy here was how you made hexes with materials to discover artifacts. That's really interesting, and I'd like to see it used elsewhere. Otherwise this is a very by the numbers dice game that has different sided dice for no real good reason other than to provide uncertainty. Plus the fact that you start off the game with a random ruin card that varies widely in points seems like an odd choice.

Unearth has a lot of promise to it. Simple rules with a good amount of strategy available to the game and a touch of die manipulation. I cannot help but feel that an expansion to the game with a few more "unique" ruins would be a boon to the game, not to mention some more named monuments. Still not bad, not exceedingly good, but I'd be lying if i said i didn't get the urge to play this once in a while.

RATING: 9
-VISUAL: First of all, as most people have noted, this game is a gem to look at. The colors and styling alone make me happy to pull this game off of the shelf. There is an element of appeal in putting stones together and collecting sets of ruins that is very pleasing in and of itself.
-LUCK/SKILL: Secondly, obviously, with dice rolls, there is an element of luck, but to say that this game is luck-based shows an extremely shallow understanding of the game and of playing odds. You have to make the decision of where you will roll your die (perhaps based on which card you want, perhaps based on which gemstone you want, or perhaps to bluff which cards you are going after), and WHICH die you will use, obviously significantly changing your chances of either claiming the ruin or taking a stone or pushing the ruin over its number limit and gaining some delver cards. You even have decisions to make when using the stones to build wonders. Should you try to get all of the stones to be one color and take a little longer or rush through and take what you can get. Usually depends on what's available. 
-FLOW: Despite all of the things to take into account as listed above, the decisions are subtle and rarely overwhelming. The decisions are important but still can be made rather quickly, allowing for continuous play, and decisions and die rolls will often force you to adapt a new strategy or pull out a useful delver card when the going gets tough.
-BALANCE/COMPETITIVENESS: Every game I have played has been close, even when it seemed like it might not be, but a lot of times long-term strategies ended up paying off at the right time, or delver cards brought home a few ruins, or the very last card

This is SmashUp without abilities, cards and fun. Your characters are dice and the highest single die wins the ruin it sits on.

The game is to random with little to mitigate it.

While I quite like this game, it has one unfortunate flaw which could be easily fixed in a second edition: It is extremely dependent on colors, some which are subtle shades that are hard to distinguish even by people with normal sight. For people with colorblindness (depending in type and severity), it may become downright unplayable. There would be an easy fix for that: Augment the colors with symbols. The symbols could be designed to match the overall theme of the game, so they wouldn't have to make the it any less beautiful.

Unearth is a dice placement game in which players can use dice to either claim cards to build sets, or claim tiles to build up a tableau to bonus points. Players have one d4, three d6, and one d8; on their turn they must choose both a die and a card to place it on. The die is then rolled, and if it is three or under, they can claim a tile from the card. When the total of the die values on the card exceed a printed threshold, the card is claimed by the player with the highest die. Other players then receive special power cards as a consolation prize. The cards are redeemed at the end of the game as sets (both for similar and different types), while the tiles can be arranged in donut-shapes to claim wonders for points. I'd be remiss not to mention the art--all the cards are abstract buildings as one might find in an M.C. Escher painting or the popular mobile game Monument Valley, and they are stunning. The gameplay itself was fairly unique, but not particularly memorable.

Unearth is a game I bought solely based on the front cover art when I was waiting in line at my local games store. The art is uniquely stylized, using isometric designs and great colors. All of the cards in the game are beautiful and a lot of the game actually relies on the colors and their combinations.

The game play is pretty simple. Each player (you can have up to four) has five dice, one d4, one d8 and three d6s. These dice represent your miners/explorers. There are also five different ruins that you can choose to explore, each ruin has a certain amount of stones on them (typically 2-3) and requires a certain exploration number to be claimed. Every turn you pick on of your dice to explore one of the ruins. By rolling on the ruin you can collect the stones, with a roll of 1-3 or potentially claim the ruin if the total amount of dice on the ruin add up or are higher than the exploration number. Getting stones allows you to build wonders that get you points and claiming ruins also give you points at the end of the game. You replace claimed ruins from a deck until there are no more left and the game ends. 

Unearth has enough diversity in ending cards and randomized set up that it's never exactly the same. It's easy to learn, but there are still a few different strategies you can employ to win and maximize your turns. I've yet to get bored of the game despite how simple it is. 

A beautifully designed, fun, short and relatively inexpensive game that I ended up being glad I bought on a whim.

A simple game title that I bought on a whim. If you like dice games this will be in your ballpark. 
The mechanics are simple. Select a die (d4,d6,d8) and a location (ruin), and roll. Roll high, you will win the ruin once the sum of dice on the ruin matches the required value. , the high die wins the ruin.  Roll low and you will get a mineral token to collect that build wonders as an alternate path for victory points. Roll in the middle and most likely well be getting a consolation prize, every other die than the winners color get a delver card.
The delver cards are used during a turn to to mitigate the die roll change it value, change the location, modify already placed dice etc. They can be strategic to help finish mineral sets, or win a ruin.

The objective is to collect sets of ruins, or sets of minerals that allow you to build wonders 

Not a must buy, but a fun game to play as diversion every once and awhile. I found the colors and art work appealing as well has having a variety of dice sizes to use. It is also a decent gateway to non-gamers.

Looks really neat and appears to be a well balanced "base-breaker". Mitigations for crappy dice rolls, multiple avenues to scoring. Good art too! And now I have played I am very impressed. Scales well. I get the feeling it will go down to the wire more often than not. Lots of strategies. Lots of variety with only 4-6 named wonders per game and these can make or break it for you. Some games just really hit the sweet spot - and for me, this is one such game. AWESOME!!

2-4 players, best with 3; 30-60 min; light weight.
I love this one, and highly recommend it for several reasons.
It is light weight, but has enough decision making and variability to keep it interesting.  
It is easy to learn, is well balanced, plays fairly quickly (45 min), and rules are well written. 
Although there is some luck involved, good strategy and tactical decisions are more important.  But it is light enough that you don't suffer from 'analysis paralysis'.    
And most importantly, it plays very well with 2 players.

I really enjoyed this game. After playing through once, I realize some of my mistakes where I got stuck without dice in front of me. I think that held me up a little. It is still pretty light and does rely a good amount on dice rolls. Even with the dice rolls, they have built in things that help mitigate luck. With the quick play, I don't mind some luck and the lightness. I'll consider picking it up if I find a good deal on it.

RATING: 8
The only downside to this game is how different it is from other standard board games. You need somebody willing to learn the new mechanics and focus on playing. 
All in all this game is very relaxed, quicker to pick up, and good length games.

Multi-player area majority with dice works only slightly better than you'd fear.  A low roll can be as good as a high roll in theory, but in practice you want one or the other and it's luck which you get.  Also, rolling 4's is just bad luck.

It's a very pretty game and has lot of choices that are theoretically interesting, but all that is overwhelmed by randomness.

update:  it's much worse with 4 than 2

The game may be greatly improved by just adding "when you roll a 4, draw an action card".  That consoles the unlucky roll and injects more agency.  But I think it really also needs some revisions to the wonders (more special powers that drive a strategy rather than just offer a scoring formula) and make the action cards better balanced and more interesting.

2 player:  5/10
4 player:  3/10
with draw-action-for-4:  +1

The game is very luck based. I usually don't mind luck based dice rolling game because it gives young children a chance to win. However, this game can be pretty mean. You can spend your turns to build up your engine and one player can scope in and take the ruin from you. It happened couple of times in my games and the player felt terrible and frustrated. Overall, the game is fun but you have to be careful who you are playing with. If people don't like mean game(young children), this may not be for them.

Got as a gift for little brother, on recommendation from FLGS.  Great little game, a bit luck-driven, I think it would be better if you could pick the delver cards you got when you got them.  But, that aside, a great, BEAUTIFUL game.

The art is very good. The game is very meh. I didn't like placing the dice on the cards, that seemed very boring to me. I liked making the rings in my tableau, and seeing how different it was to the other players. But overall there's not much special here other than the art.

There are a lot of random elements in the game, but the abilities give you opportunities to mitigate your risk/luck factor. The amount of luck in this game, I feel, is just right for the heaviness/length of the game.

I thought the game was very enjoyable, and will end up in my collection once it is published.  I give it 8 / 10

I really liked this game.  I know many don't like the luck element with the dice rolls, but how many times have we heard that before.  I never have a problem with luck in games, it's part of the equation here.  But there are still lots of decisions to make here when going after cards to complete sets and trying to secure the bonus cards.  Fun game.

RATING: 8.5
One of the most pleasant surprises of this year. Combining simple mechanics (at its core is just a dice managemente game) what makes 'Unearth' so enjoyable, apart from its gorgeous art, is trying to read what the other players are trying to achieve in order to get there before they do. As the ruin cards are the same for everyone, that stepping over a fellow can be both gratifying and frustrating and, ultimately, the generator of quite a few laughs.

RATING: 3
I normally don't mind luck in games and infact enjoy it many times. But this game uses luck to make me feel helpless and makes my decisions feel like they have a lack of agency.  It feels like I can target cards I want but then someone can come in roll max on their dice and take it from me. Sure I will get some delver cards to help reduce the risk of getting the next card but I hate that the delver cards have to be played before you roll. If I need to roll a 4 do I use the card that gives me +2 to my next six sided dice roll? I mean if I roll a 4, 5, or 6 then it makes no difference and I just wasted the card, or even worse if I roll a 1 then I did not even get the card I was aiming for but I still used a delver card on it.... So there is a 2/3 chance the delver card I am using will be totally worthless and that is what it sorta feels like with most of the cards in the game. Sure I can grab stones if I roll a 1, 2, or 3 which is nice and can help mitigate bad rolls that way but then it just makes 4 a bad roll and if I need stones and roll my 4 sided dice and hit a 4 then I still just feel bad. I just feel like this game has a lot of feel bad moments where you are trying to hit a specific number miss it and get punished.

I feel like if the designer had just made it so you could play the delver card AFTER you rolled then it would feel like they are so much more powerful and could actually be used more strategically instead of putting you in a well hope I don't roll a 1 scenario. 

If you are looking for a push your luck game I would recommend Incan Gold. Faster, simpler, and just more fun in my opinion.

Cool tactical game mechanics involving dice rolling and cards where you are able to build "rings" from gems and construct minor and major wonders.  The artwork is beautiful, and it is a nice light-ish to slightly medium complexity game that would work for gamers and non-gamers alike.

Ok, there are strategical elements and cards can help you with dices, but even which cards you draw is a luck element, as well the colors of the ruins removed from the game.

An average dice game.  I like that both high or low rolls can have use, but nothing else about it is terribly interesting.  It also goes on too long for how repetitive it feels.

RATING: 6
I like a lot of what Unearth does as a dice game. High rolls make it more likely to claim a ruin, while low rolls nab blocks for building wonders. It's just too bad that it wasn't wrapped around something more interesting. It's like one of the ruins it portrays: pretty on the outside, hollow within.

This game has some beautiful artwork but ultimately the game is tedious and all too luck based.  The game plays similar to Smash Up but ultimately you have to settle with what you roll.  Now rolling dice in games isn't always bad if you get to decide what you do after rolling or being able to modify the dice afterwards.  But all decisions you make have to be done BEFORE you roll.  So really it's just output randomness on top of output randomness.  Very disappointed.

Less chaotic than I feared - it actually does a reasonably good job of making the various die rolls all worth something, although I can see how someone could still get royally screwed by the dice (rolling a lot of 4s, for example).

However, general feeling was that four players was too many.

Phenomenal game!  Really glad we snatched this one up on a whim.  It has a fun dice rolling mechanism that doesn't feel *too* luck based.  Yes, there is some luck involved, but there is also plenty of strategy to go along with it.  It does seem like 2P easily goes to the person who focused on winning as many cards as possible, but at 4P scores are tighter and wonders become more important.

What a fun game. At first I thought it was a strange game but after watching some reviews I gave it a chance. It looks like a complicated game but it's not. If you like rolling dice games you will love it. Even with that said you can use your dice to do many things. They can give you tiles or Delver cards. You can choose which ruin card to put it on, then roll the dice. How you use the different dice it how makes it exciting. Watch what cards your opponents choose to see if you want to go against them or just put a dice on these to get a tile or a Delver card after it scores. Getting more Delver cards gives you more choices when rolling dice. 
Great art work. A very nice insert holds every thing perfectly. A must buy, I am so happy I bought it.

Simple, yet elegant game - perfect for a pick up or an evening of play.  Can be played in 30 minutes, longer games are easy with 4 players.  The artwork is surreal and evocative of the theme, lost civilizations and tribes in search of their history. The rules are mostly clear, though some of the Delver Cards could use better explanation - especially when used in conjunction with other Delver cards.

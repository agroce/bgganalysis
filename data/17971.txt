Remake of Western desert. Seems to add more complexity for not much real benefit. Graphically significant improvement although it has itself been superceded.

RATING: 4
Prefer Western Desert as the Italian units values have been tinkered with.
Traded/given away in the european war-game chain of generosity.

Unfortunately the Desert Campaign can come down to 2 huge armoured stacks trying to crunch each other. The Italians take a beating...but secretly enjoy it. Plenty of smaller scenarios for the chronologically challenged.

After spending 10-12hrs on a Western Desert campaign, including all the fiddly stuff for Malta and shipping, downgraded rating to a 6. It may be historically accurate, but not much fun as a game. I think between two experienced players the system bogs down, particuarly when you play to take advantage of quirk in the system. The d6 comabt table is also showing it's age.

Not yet played. It looks an absolute monster of a game, and Vassal appears to be the only way to play this.

North Africa!  Well, I have quite a few games of this campaign (well it's got Aussies, Rommel & DAK) but could never afford the (unplayable) SPI Campaign for North Africa and this is almost as big.  Europa works well for this campaign and the "bonus" is you can play the Aussies vs Vichy in Syria sideshow.

I find this game difficult to rate. The package is an attempt to work towards harmonising the "Grand Europa" concept and in this it excels, with the package providing a wealth of opportunity for this theatre. 

That being said my lone gripe with the game (which leads me to rate this game 1 or 2 points lower than it should be) concerns the changing in play dynamics. The shift in dynamics have seen everything move in favour of the Axis forces, thus tilting the distribution of game play results. Indeed the distribution of results is now so bad that the Axis are invariably pushing the Allies far back into Egypt in early to mid 1941. The ebb and flow that was so much a feature of this campaign, and which made the former game "Western Desert" so enjoyable, is now absent from many games.
Attempts have been made to correct these issues in the expansion module "Wavell's War".

I'm currently playing this with Wavell's War rules and it plays very well. The early (pre-mid '42) British armour has been downgraded since the old GDW Western Desert and the Italian air upgraded, so there are several nail-biting periods for the British. I played this with the Graziani's offensive start and, other than for pure historical interest, wouldn't recommend it as it just allows the Axis a less stupid start point than historically.

Good solid game in the Europa series. A bit of a tendency to depend on one or two critical die rolls (as the Germans and British each can only build one or two solid stacks of units.

Have this one in all it's incarnations. The small unit density & emphasis on maneuver shows the Europa System at its best. Have played it a zillion times. Loses a point due to a historical quibble, albeit one shared by every desert game I've played - the action never stops. Whereas historically, large amounts of time was spent mucking about in the rear or building up for the Great Offensive, for example the almost 6 month period separating Battleaxe & Crusader. 10+ turns without either side attacking on the main front? Unheard of. One of the great games otherwise though.

A great game with low counter density.  It simulates well enough combat in North Africa.

Third Generation Europa treatment of the war in North Africa and parts of the Middle East. Replaces 'Torch', 'Western Desert', and the 'Near East'. Somewhat improved maps from the original games, and the counters have been upgraded as well. Turned three big games into one really big game with some of the wrinkles ironed out.

This game recreates the desert war and feels right. For a Europa game, it is even pretty playable!

remake of the Europa series games for war in the Near East and North Africa. Its good work and with all the scenarios produced and published in The Europa Magazine you can play this for a long time. Recommended

I like Europa, and this one was fine, I played WD a lot this is a bit more complex and plays differently due to changes to air support and a couple of other things but still a good game.

RATING: 6
Simple to explain, quick to play, random setup. Good stuff. The ability to leverage the board to give incentive to your opponent to do things and trap them as a result is a novel element (and since the board changes each game, it's not as simple as just memorizing where the traps are). The largest hurdle is getting people interested to play; it's a solid little abstract though.

Can be a little bit confusing at the beginning. The "0" level is a tactic game, it improves in strategy with levels 1 and 2. Very beautiful components. A minute to learn, a lifetime to master.

Simple rules, quick play, easy set-up, but doesn't feel trivial at all.  I'm not convinced the first half of the game is much more than random, but the end game makes for interesting decisions.  THree different ways to score shoudl also keep it interesting after repeated play.

Somewhat extended set-up time and speed of play remind me of Hey! That's My Fish. Not much seems to matter early in the game, but the mid- to late-game decisions are interesting.

Mind Games winner.  Liked it from the first time we played it in 2013, and it's become a regular part of the abstract rotation.  (Increased rating because of repeat play.)

Like other Foxmind games, nicely designed wood components that enhance enjoyment of the game.   (We play with black and white marbles rather than black and red.)

I will add on pricing (since I overpaid) - quality of the components notwithstanding -- a price point closer to $25 is possible and better.

New too me, requires a bit of joint memory to keep the game together...probably needs some markers to aid the absent-minded. The scoring is deceptive, but leads to new strategies.

RATING: 9
A classic abstract. Easy to learn, difficult to master, has scalable difficulty and a variable board. A rich, beautiful, brain-tickling game. Note that none of the videos here on BGG (that I've seen, anyway) seem to mention or do justice to the three ways of scoring, or even the situations produced by a non-square setup, nor even how being able to force the game to end is an important tool/risk. Many dozens of plays on the app. The only reason it's not a 10 is that it can be difficult, especially for beginners, to keep track all the relevant information.

Interesting abstract that is different enough to be fun.

Plays in about 10 minutes (or less) and definitely involves strategy and thinking ahead.  I think it's fun enough that you could have it sit on your coffee table all the time.

I like this a lot. It has the "choose your opponent's options" of Coffee and the mini-area control of ConHex, but without as many tedious forced moves as Coffee or the stagnant feeling of ConHex. And the modular board gives it the type of replayability I like.

Preferred Variant 1 (score for your largest group) to the vanilla game; haven't tried Variant 2 yet.

I already admired this game from playing it online and from it's simple, beautiful structure. The physical version only enhances my admiration. Just lovely, if a bit simple strategically. It's in the category of games like Hey, That's My Fish, strategy-wise. Among light abstract strategy games like this, it's one of my favorites.

Neat modular board that you can set up differently each time, pretty red and black marbles.

Area control (most marbles on a board claims points equal to number of holes on the board).

Each move determines the row or column in which the following move must be made. Neat elegant little game. Didn't read the rules, but looks like it has various variants.

If it had been cheaper, we'd have probably bought it at Essen 2011.

--Jan2016-- It's an amusing design.  I've no idea yet (after only a single play) whether the endgame is subtle or only surprising; but the possibility of the former leaves me intrigued.

RATING: 8
I was looking for a strategy game to buy for my son when I was in Germany last year and this was recommended. It is deceptively simple, but it doesn't take long to realize you must plan ahead. Not anywhere near as deep as chess, but I can tell that it is going to take a lot of play in order to start to develop real strategies instead of just looking ahead 2 or 3 moves. While I'm sure patterns will start to emerge, the fact that the game board is configured differently every time should prevent it from getting too predictable.

More fun than I expected. It plays quickly, but with many interesting decisions. The variable board setup offers interesting replayability options. While the decision space is limited by the placement rules, the game obviously gains its brilliance here as well. I like it. The people I've introduced it to like it. Sounds like a winner to me.

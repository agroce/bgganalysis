Played three times with three different opponents and it has been a tale of rapidly diminishing returns for me.  For the fugitive there are precious few decisions.  He plays the cards he can to get to the plane as quickly as possible; sometimes there is a choice of card, sometimes there isn't.  Standing still can be fatal.  For the Marshal there is lots of calculation and there are decisions about the deck(s) to draw from and how many hideouts to guess this turn.  The game plays quickly and generates enough tension to persuade me to return to it occasionally.

Production quality is excellent.  I particularly like the attaché case box.  Ryan Goldsberry's retro cartoon artwork is splendid.  The rules seem clear.

Intreresting take of an hidden movement game turned into a card-filler for 2
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.9
This game is totally abstract in its soul but, with the superb illustrations, one can feel the sweat of the chaser or the fugitive. The first moves of the fugitive have quite a decisive role. Marshall's duty is to make a lot of calculations and keep an eye on which stack the Fugitive draws cards from. We haven't tried the extra cards yet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fugitive is a quick and easy two player card game where one player is a fugitive trying to escape from a Marshall using numbered cards 1-41, as hideouts and attempting to play the escape card 42. The Marshall player on his turns tries to guess hideouts, and if all are guessed successfully, the fugitive is captured!

A 2p asymmetric game with some light deduction. One players plays as the Fugitive placing hidden numbered cards. The Marshall is attempting to "capture" the Fugitive by figuring out which cards he's playing. There's not a ton of depth here and I think playing the Marshall is much more interesting. The Fugitive has a couple tricks up their sleeve but otherwise your only goal is to play higher and higher cards. My Kickstarter version also comes with Event cards that add variability which I have yet to try.

This latest Tim Fowers (Burgle Bros, Paperback) creation is an asymmetrical two player hidden movement deduction style game. It does a good job of making things tense for both players, and wraps up in 10-20 minutes, which puts it in very solid 2-player filler time. I highly recommend it if this sounds interesting to you.

I found this to be a fun little box of head games. It is definitely a lot more fun to play detective rather than fugitive, but is plays so quickly that it is easy to switch it up. Seems like a tough game for the fugitive against a decent detective, but that's definitely part of the fun.

One of the only asymmetrical 2-player filler games that I know of. And this light and quick deduction game is a good one. Choices are usually somewhat limited, but I like the amount of depth here in relation to the game's length and weight. One negative is that it does take up kind of a lot of table space for what amounts to a simple card game.

Kickstarted. 

A very fun and light 2-player social deduction game that could have been merely okay, but the art alone elevates it into something special. There's a story to be told with the cards, an element we missed until half-way through our first play-through. Suddenly what was a fun little competition between my wife and I became a quest to find the next piece of the "linear" plot. The addition of the Marshall's tracker board is a huge aid to players who don't have eidetic or photographic memories. Game play is fast and enjoyable with a noticeable slant in favor of the Fugitive unless alternative cards and rules are used. Thankfully, the cards are included (no addition expansion purchase required) and the variant rules are laid out clearly in the manual. Between multiple options of gameplay and artwork that is more clever than it needed to be, Fugitive is near the top of our go-to list of light fillers.

My wife surprised me by really digging this game...and then we figured out we were playing one key rule wrong. Welp, we still play our funky house rule modify and eh kind of enjoy it for a two player game. It has a bit of binge-worthiness to it. Some of the fun of Scotland Yard, but much shorter gameplay and both players are very engaged, where sometimes Scotland Yard turns into a one-man show. For being a light game of guessing and some counting and a little estimation, it does pack in some fun, suspenseful moments that really simulate that "fugitive" feel.

Nice little 2 player filler, where one player is trying to lay a hidden trail of ascending cards, from 0 to 42.  The other player is trying to identify them and flip them before 42 is reached.  The trick here is no jump can be greater than 3, but it can be boosted with other cards that are discarded for their sprint value instead of taking their place in the sequence.  Cute - works well.

This game is close to capturing the tension of the great hidden movement games I've played like Letters from Whitechapel, but I think it needs the movement aspect - the numbers alone maybe make it a bit drier. I think throwing in the Events, which I've not yet done, will help spice it up tho.

Deduction games are not my bag. My mind is not built for such things, however; this one was most pleasant. The process of deducing which number your opponent played was a refreshing twist on the genre, and the artwork and packaging helped elevate this one.

If I hadn't been burned out playing Hanamikoji all weekend, I would of ranked this one a 6, but as things currently stand, I've had a fill of micro games these days.

This is an excellent two player game and we really took to playing a lot of Fugitive when it first showed up. It's not a game with a *ton* of staying power after we've played it so many times though, as the Marshall usually ends up winning in the games played with my SO. We know each others' strategies very well. With new people though, it's still a great game!

Nails it.  Just long enough.  Really well balanced.  Event cards add replayability and allow for balance tweaking (if your players aren't matched evenly - the roles are really impressively balanced but players may not be).

And I was truly impressed with the amount of different strategies available for both players in a very quick card game.

It takes up some table space though for what it is.

PNPlayed this. (yeah I'm cheap and I'm in Thailand so shipping and customs would make it too expensive).  - Its a simple build from the supplied PNP file.  I enjoyed my first plays so much I designed my own improving the design (card numbers both top and bottom and shrinking the card size to 5 x 7.2cm.  43 cards only.  It really does create tension with deductive challenge / imaginative play.  Its my current go to game and will always be an excellent filler/restaurant/bar game.  By Tim Fowers who also Burgle Bros.  Note I have not see event cards - the base game is great with out them - they may make it better.  
June 2017: I have turned a lot of people on to this game and always travel with spare sets to give as mini gifts.  Adding a cellotape "laminate" aid card for the sheriff for future play.

„Kapj el, ha tudsz!”
A Burgle Bros című koop társasjáték (kedvelem, jól sikerült gém) szerzőjének legújabb műve, amelyben egy szökevény és egy rendőrbíró(nő) versengését tudjuk lejátszani. A játékban a szökevény győz, ha sikerül meglépnie, a rendőr, ha sikerül a szökevény összes búvóhelyét felderítenie, mielőtt az eléri a meneküléshez szükséges repülőgépét.
A játék nagyon szép aktatáskához hasonló kivitelben jelent meg (kickstarteren volt elérhető). Az alapjáték szabályán kívül más angol szöveggel nem találkozik az ember, azonban az eseménylapok már angol szöveget tartalmaznak.
A játék szabálya egyszerű, gyorsan megtanulható. A játékban egymás után következve a rendelkezésre álló 43 lapból (00-42 számozással) először a szökevény húz kártyát a pakliból majd helyez le képpel lefelé búvóhelyet (első kör után nem kötelező). Utána a rendőrbíró húz lapot és tippelhet egy vagy több rejtekhelyet azok száma alapján (több tippnél mindegyiknek helyesnek kell lennie). Ha eltalálta, a szökevény köteles azt átfordítani. Ha minden rejtekhely felfedésre került és a szökevény még nem lépett meg, a rendőrbíró nyer. Neki van még egy kis segédlapja, amelyen vezetheti, hogy milyen lapokat tippelt, ha nem lenne szupermemóriája (nekem nincs).
Későbbi játékok során különböző eseményekkel színesíthetitek a játékmenetet. Az események játékba kerülésének többféle változatát a szabály tartalmazza. Érdemes próbát tenni vele.
Egy parti köbö 15-20 perc vagy még annyi sem és lehet szerepet cserélni a visszavágó miatt.
Jó kis számolgatós „mindgame” szép kivitelben, angol nyelven és nehezen beszerezhetően. Kipróbálásra ajánlott 2 fős társas.

 I don't know what the market is like for 2-player social deduction games, but this certainly fits the mold. One player is the fugitive trying to hide from their opponent, the Marshall, by playing numbered hideouts (cards #1-42) facedown in ascending order (with the ability to skip some numbers). The Marshall wins if they can correctly guess all the hideout cards in play at any time, the fugitive wins if they play hideout #42 before that happens. It's easy to learn and simple to play, but it definitely feels like a playing card game with artwork. Seasoned gamers will get bored of it quickly, but casual card players might enjoy it as an alternative to Go Fish or Crazy Eights.

Very light and easy to play deduction game with one playing as the fugitive and one playing as a marshall on pursuit. There's a bit of a bluffing element in the game when the fugitive try to put out more cards to trick the marshall into thinking he's moved further than he actually is. Its an entertaining game but I wish the whole bluffing and deduction could be deeper. As it stands right now its a quick filler game that gets repetitive very fast.

Fugitive is a very streamlined design, simple to teach, plays in 15-20 minutes, and really satisfies fans of deductive games. One player is the fugitive, who plays a series of face-down number cards trying to get to number 42 while the marshal tries to guess all of the face down numbers before the fugitive can meet his goal. 

On their turns the fugitive and the marshal draw a card from three shuffled decks in three progressive number ranges, 4-14, 15-28, and 29-41. The fugitive can play a face-down card (a "hideout") that is within 3 numbers of the previously played card. The fugitive can optionally play a higher number by adding sprint cards. Every card has 1 or 2 footsteps on it and the fugitive can play 1 number over the 3 advancement limit for every footstep played. These "sprint" cards are played face down next to the hideout and are revealed if the hideout is guessed correctly. The card the marshal draws eliminates a card for the fugitive to play and assists in deducting the hideouts. The marshal can guess at least one hideout per turn. If guessed correctly, the hideout and associated sprint cards are revealed. The marshal can guess more than one hideout, but they are only revealed if every guessed card is correct. When the 42 card is placed face-up, the marshal gets one final chance to accurately guess all remaining face down hideouts, otherwise the fugitive wins.

The fugitive can play more sprint cards than he needs, as in so doing mislead the marshal. With a logically deductive marshal, I suspect the fugitive must bluff, or the hideouts are too calculable. In my experience, the marshal has a huge advantage without some good deception from the fugitive. Event cards were included that increases the uncertainty, but I haven't tried them yet and the game doesn't need them.

A very clever one-dimensional hidden movement game, drawing out an amazing depth of theme (roadblocks! search teams! airport security!) from the slim rules of choosing which pile to draw from. Unconvinced by the event cards, which feel like they just get in the way, but the base game is more than enough.

I've generally enjoyed the games of Tim Fowers, and when Fugitive popped up on KS I figured, why not? As usual with his games, the graphic design is incredible, with a lot more thought and effort put into it than was really necessary. The gameplay itself is really interesting, with a fairly mathematical game feeling tense and tricky. Great job all around!

First couple of plays with just the base game, no events. Felt like the game was unbalanced in the Marshal's favor. Will have to play more to be sure, I don't think I was making the most of the Fugitive's sprints.

Still it's a fun deduction game and I like to deduce!

UPDATE: Moved this up from 6.5. It's a great game for two players who want some quick fun. Still haven't played with the event cards though.

Nice little asymmetric 2 player deduction game.  As the fugitive, I like figuring out when and how to use cards to sprint vs. bluffing.  As the detective, I like the steady drip of information and the narrowing leads, and the occasional insights into the fugitive's mind.  It's not particularly flashy or exciting, so I'm not reaching to play it all the time, but I'm glad to own it.

Fugitive manages to be a hidden movement, asymmetric, card based deduction game for two players very sucessfully. Once players have grasped the concepts games play out in 10-20minutes and nearly always result in a swapping of roles and going again. It is a tight smooth package with plenty of extras through the event cards which can interact in different ways with the game. Another winner from Fower!

Great game. Not a filler, as you'll want to play it serval times in a row. I've seen the Fugitive get caught on the first turn(!) and have a skin of the teeth escape, the marshall only having one hideout to get left, and knowing it is one of two cards... tense stuff. Big up to the artwork & production,  get mini-story on the cards as flavour.

This is a two player only filler game where one player is the thief and the other player is the cops. The thief plays cards face down to represent the places they go when they run, and each place has a number on it. The thief has restrictions on how high a number he can place based on his previous placement, and the cop reveals those cards when he guesses the numbers correctly. Through bluffing on the part of the thief or through deductive guessing on the part of the cop, does a player win. It's cute enough, the art is nice, but I don't feel the need to play it again.

What a delightful little experience.  
The central game of cat and mouse really comes to life for both players, and it's short enough to leave you wanting more.
There's more than just a little luck of the draw to this, which can be frustrating for either side... but overall the game offers enough tactical decision space to make it feel like it was your fault for running your hand so thinly that a single draw could put you in hot water.

My wife and I really like this 2 player game.  It's quick and easy.  In our experience there seems to be a slight advantage to the fugitive.  I don't think it's so much that it ruins the game, but I definitely think it's easier to play as the fugitive.

What's with the event cards?  I'm not sure I understand why they are in the game.  We never play with them.  It just complicates an otherwise super streamlined game.

This is a very great, fun game. It's what I would call "Letters From Whitechapel Lite". Hidden movement where the investigator is getting clues and discovering hideouts. It seems that it's easier to be the fugitive as the base game, but I'm still trying more strategies. What's great about that is that they included event cards and variants to help balance or as a catch up mechanic for whomever is behind at the time. Perfect representation of a hidden movement game in a small box and short play time.

Two player competitive deduction game.  Players use a series of cards numbered 0 through 42 to simulate a chase sequence.  The fugitive player draws and plays cards face down in ascending order to reach the number 42 card while the inspector attempts to guess the face down cards before the fugitive can escape.  Simple in concept, but surprisingly tight and well-balanced.

RATING: N/A
As someone who doesn't at all like the designer's signature game, Paperback, I was surprised at how much I liked this game.

This is another game that I would consider to be a good couple's game. It's very light and a few lucky or unlucky guesses will ultimately decide who wins. This could be frustrating if playing competitively, but the ease of play and the play time (around 20 minutes) make it an enjoyable experience.

Why was this sitting on my shelf, unplayed, for soooo long? Brilliant game! I don't know how 41 cards can hold so much tension and so many possible strategies, but I do know that I've only scratched the surface! Beautiful box art/design/use of space as Fowers has come to be known for by now.

Play as the fugitive on the run from the marshal, trying to cleverly evade as she closes in while inching ever closer to your getaway plane. Then switch places and play from the other side! So, so fun. (10-20-17)

Fugitive packs a good amount of tension into a fairly straightforward card game. Dividing the cards into sequential stacks offers some strategy in blocking or bluffing your opponent.

Great light 2p game. I'm always on the lookout for something fun and simple to play with my wife, and possibly travel with. Regarding the last point, not a great travel game because it hoards too much table space. Even on our long coffee table we were using a lot of real estate. Probably a good candidate for mini cards.  But the gameplay was tight, strategic and enjoyable.

Fugitive is a two player game from Tim Fowers, a designer whose games I generally enjoy.

One player is the fugitive and must create a path to an escape plane by playing cards facedown. The other player is the long arm of the law who must track the fugitive's path by guessing the numbers of the facedown cards and catching the fugitive before he can play the last card (the #42) which is the fugitive's plane.

There's a deck of cards numbered 1 through 42. There's a draw deck that is split into three piles (4-14, 15-28, and 29-41). The fugitive always starts with numbers 1, 2, 3 and 42. They also randomly draw three cards from the 4-14 deck and two cards from the 15-28 deck.

On a turn, the fugitive draws a card (from whichever deck they prefer) and plays a card facedown if they can/want (and can play extra "buried" cards). The cards a fugitive can play must be at maximum 3 steps from the last numbered card he's played... except every card has either 1 or 2 footprint symbols on it, and the fugitive can bury these cards under the path card he's playing to extend his maximum reach by whatever footprints he spends (which is visible to the Marshall). The fugitive's goal is to chain up to the #42 card before the Marshall can uncover all the fugitive's path cards.

On the first turn, the marshall starts with two random cards from whatever decks they prefer. On each subsequent turn they will draw one card and then guess a number. If the fugitive has played that card as part of their hideout path, they must reveal that card. The marshall can guess multiple cards in a go, but if any of the guesses are wrong, then the fugitive can simply deny the guess in toto.

The game is a large deduction puzzle. The marshal can narrow down which cards the fugitive has played by drawing cards from the relevant deck. Since there is only one of each number, a card the marshal sees is a number that the fugitive couldn't have. Additionally, when the marshal guesses a number and the fugitive doesn't reveal it, that narrows down what the path cards must be. The marshal should also keep an eye on what decks the fugitive has drawn from and played so as to know what numbers they might have in their hand.

I enjoyed the game a lot. It's fairly quick. I think it would take a few plays to get down some of the strategies on how to play. It seemed a little easier for the fugitive, but perhaps that's because I hadn't quite gotten down how to play the marshal yet.

This game is horribly unbalanced. There's an optimal known strategy for the Fugitive which is nowhere near good enough. There's a very high chance the game is over on the first or second turn. Played 10 times, Marshall won every time. Only one game was even interesting.

phantastic game!
two player game in which one is the fugitive and the other one tries to catch him.
The fugitive can play "number cards" to fix his position (of course hidden) while the other player tries to deduce, where the fugitive could be with simple combinatory thoughts...
This is my absolutely favourite two player game, I can highly recommend it

It's simple and fun.  I am awful at this type of game, but it doesn't overstay its welcome.  Nice art and presentation.  I'd rather play Theo's than some of its larger deductive reasoning cousins.  Played 4 times in our first setting.

Engaging to play as both sides, love the asymmetry. Setup and play are both quick. Great 2 player game, which are particularly valuable for me these days.

Two player deduction. One player is trying to escape, while other is figuring out the played cards. I believe this will be better with repeated plays against the same opponent.

It may not be Fowers' best work, but that's an incredibly high bar. Fugitive is a strong entry in the aysmmetric hidden movement genre, and its niche (playing in 20 minutes) is very much needed. You basically have to play two games to give both players a chance, but that's fine! The event cards are swingy but they're there if you want to spice things up.

The only downside there is to this game is that it plays 2p and that's it. Otherwise, it's probably my favourite filler.

A simple deduction game that is effective at what it sets out to do. A two-player game where one player plays the role of the Fugitive, attempting to escape, while the other plays the role of the Marshal, attempting to catch the Fugitive.

The game plays different for both the Marshal and the Fugitive. The fugitive is attempting to bluff and build a set of hideouts until they (eventually) escape. The Marshal is attempting to build enough evidence by limiting the amount of Hideouts available to the fugitive. 

Card quality is excellent and gameplay is simple and to the point. In my opinion it is a game worth having in your collection.

Asymmetric two-player deduction card game. Prisoner player breaks from jail (Card 0) and is trying to reach the getaway (Card 42) before the Marshall player catches them by correctly naming every hideout along the way.  Hideout cards must ascend in value by no more than 3 boosted by sprint cards. Prisoner can bluff with fake sprint cards. Limited knowledge each turn as Marshall draws from low, medium and large value hideout stacks.

A very good asymmetrical 2-person game. One person is trying to escape and can use bluffing and the other is using deduction to find where they were and are.

This game is really interesting. I like the cat and mouse aspect where the goals of the two sides are different. My only hesitation is the Manhunt part seems a little screwy. Seems to me like it's always better for the Marshall to stay under 29 and play for the manhunt.

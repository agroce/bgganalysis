Doesn't add much except a little board map and Ring token, as you defeat the Archenemies the Ring moves along a path on the little map, and occasionally there will be some effect that comes into play, and whoever Destroys the ring can flip the token over for more VP. Otherwise, it plays just like its two predecessors. There are also Quest cards on the Path that you can satisfy by playing other cards or combos.

RATING: 7
More deck building using the system I first saw in the DC Comics game.
The addition of the Ring moving is interesting but I'm not sure how much it introduces. Having each player have a special card instead of a permanent ability is more of a difference.

RATING: 7.5
The Lord of the Rings Deck-Building games are simple, fun, and can be combined together, which adds value to the series overall. Don't expect a story to develop, as these games are strictly competitive, mechanical point-grabbers. The movie stills are generally gorgeous, however, and it's a great way to engage Middle-Earth in a casual, lightweight way; I reach for these games often. [b]The Return of the King[/b] introduces a fairly inconsequential "Journey of the One Ring" tracker, but adds a bit more complexity in terms of card interactions.

RATING: 7.5
The third and final installment of the LOTR: DBG's, I like them all equally. The ROTK game's uniqueness comes from the Journey track. Some cards will allow you to move on the track with your end goal being Mordor and the Cracks of Doom. Some enemies move your marker back when they appear. Easy to play, easy to teach. By the time of this game, they really nailed down the balance of the cards and it really shows. Good stuff.

Cerberus deck builder. Cards/abilities are very thematic. Own too many in this genre.

Played this in combination with the Two Towers, Return of the King, and the Hobbit sets.  I like deck builders and would probably like each of these individually, but all together the game just became unwieldy.

Has made my oldest daughter's top 10 favorite games. This was her first deck-builder. The theme was what interested her - huge Lord of the Rings fan.
I got this series of games for a great price (less than 1/4 the price), but never thought I would get to play it - competitive with no good solo rules.
Has a poor reputation, but I actually enjoy playing it. We have created / are creating some cooperative rules so we can play as a team. Any LotR game where you play as the Fellowship needs to be cooperative - just feels wrong to be competing against other players.
Each game has a enough of a different game play to make them feel different.

Nothing interesting or unusual, just an average deck building game. If I'm going to play a deck building game, it will never be this one.

A great addition to the trilogy.  It's certainly the most complex among them, and the most punishing...which both lead to longer play time (It is common for all of the corruption to get dolled out by game end  :o/).  It actually feels like it drags sometimes.

As for "The final journey of the ring" addition, it's somewhat trivial, imo.  The ring can fly across the path, or never reach Mount Doom.  In the latter case, it merely serves to prolong defeat of the final archenemy, another way in which the game can drag.

So far, every game played with this one has felt different all the way around the table--in some cases dramatically.  This may be ranked #3 in the series for me, but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy it.  I'm very pleased that this one feels unique among the series, and I certainly do enjoy it. Time will tell if it will match either of the others for me.

Edit:  After more plays, this one is dropping for me--at least at higher player counts.  I much prefer Fellowship or Two Towers.  Return just ceases to be fun when you have several turns of 1-2 power, and in the later stages of the game no less.  I'm speaking for others at the table in addition to myself.  To clarify, this is a semi-consistent problem only at higher player counts.  At 2-players, it's never been frustrating to the point of being no fun.  I will probably only play this one at 1 or 2 players any more.

These are not as strategic or solid as Dominion or Trains (my favorite deck builders), but I find myself enjoying them a lot, partly due to my love for Lord of the Rings.

Especially love the fan service in this last one!

All these LOTR and hobbit games are the same except for an extra twist, and this is no different.  In this one there's a progression toward mount doom and destruction of the ring.  It's probably the simplest twist.  From simple to complex: Fellowship, Return of the King, Two Towers, the Hobbit

Much like the Two Towers this is basically another copy of the Fellowship deck builder, the difference is the Ring mechanic included here is actually quite fun and adds to the experience.

A lot of people seem to hate on this game because of its randomness overruling the ability to significantly effect the outcome. However I find that trait to be the most attractive aspect of these series' of games. Other aspects that make this game great are the fact that it moves quickly and smoothly. Very rarely is there a delay in the game play and even new players can power through with other more experienced ones. Not to mention that new players have the same chance at winning as others do.

Furthermore, this game gets played a ton and people enjoy it despite their perceived lack of control over the final outcome. Honestly this game is a carefree, fun, super thematic game with subculture and inside jokes just waiting to be exploited. I cannot recall a game where we didn't have fun even while knowing the final outcome was/is 80-90% beyound our control.

Not to mention it has replaced Dominion for me.

Great final chapter of the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings. The gameplay is always smooth and interactive. The pictures are fantastic. Probably the Path of the Ring towards Mount Doom is somewhat pasted on, but the game is so much fun that it is hardly noticeable.

The weakest IMO of the 3 games in this series. The rings journey is an interesting addition but ended up not actually mattering at all as one player just had a monster turn to buy Sauron to end the game.

Having played this one a little more perhaps i was too harsh on it as the cards included are very fun and lead to some cool strategies. Increased to a 7 in line with the others.

To me this is like Dominion. Deck building. I'm not a fan of deck building, but I am a HUGE fan of LOTR. I am open to new artwork but I have to admit I'm a sucker for actual images from the films we all know and love.
This game is so simple to play. It's really fun but after 5 to 10 times less so. You will quickly learn which cards are a waste of space in your deck, which ones are absolutely crucial, and which ones are broken (Lembas bread lol?). Not a lot of direct player interaction either, but there is some.

I picked this up in attempt to get something besides Cards Against Humanity to be played, but it didn't work. I played this a few times with my regular group and we all had a lot of fun.

The "ring movement" board is new, and the cards themselves add a few new mechanics, including ongoing Beacons that reward all owning players (beakers?).

Bottom line, the game is still fun.  We'll have to do a three-game marathon soon and keep a running score to determine the overall winner.

[i]Update:[/i]

There seems to be some power creep in this set, but that just makes the game faster and crazier.  So no complaints here.

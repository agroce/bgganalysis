Pretty cool game, fairly simple to pick up, gorgeous minis.  I like the mixture of card special abilities and figure powers.  The tic system of your actions costing time is original and fun.  Now if only it weren't collectible... I would rate it an 8 or 9 if it were not.  Sadly, I will not be buying this due to the randomly collectible nature of the game.

- Very good CMG. Love the mechanic.
- Pretty easy to understand the rules.
- Figures are not as good as "previewed"
- UBase is terrible! (admitted by maker also). They dont lock into the miniature and so easy to mess up the stats. Best left off the fig while gaming and beside the card as reference to time.

I really like the time element of the game where big powerful spell/attacks require more time and you get less actions per round, while small actions can be performed more frequently.

If this game were affordable and noncollectable,I'd be all over it.

Fresh mechanics that are new to the minis genre and do a good job mimicking MMORPG feel. Dislikes: the fact that you just rush towards each other and bash it out - no real incentive to be tactful. also minis and bases are extremely fiddly - in a bad way

While some miniatures games are simply just battles disconnected from any context, WoW Minis has the potential to be much more. I am amazed at the play value of just a starter and a booster set, no matter which booster you get. It's a fast, interesting, dynamic combat system with RPG-lite aspects through the customization of the action bar. It represents the nucleus of a full-fledged adventure game or dungeon crawl, from the bottom up rather than the top down. It offers opportunities for PvP, automated dungeon crawls, capture the flag, WoW Battle Ball, you name it. The figures also work with Battlelore maps or Heroscape terrain, leading to unlimited scenarios. The booster squads appear to be well balanced to perform together. It is clear that the figures you get in a booster are not just chosen at random from a bin, but are designed to be viable teams out of the box. Adding customizable action cards, 2 with each fig plus a max of 3 per fig in constructed play, means you get a great deal of customization with a very small number of game components. The figures are playable with or without the click bases, meaning you can do your record keeping all on one sheet of paper to keep track of health and character clocks. This makes them perfectly usable with Heroscape terrain. The upcoming Deluxe Starters also have mounted boards, making WoW minis a real adventure combat board game, with an unlimited number of scenarios possible. I see this game potentially filling the niche that Heroscape left behind since it has gone into hibernation. Looking forward to big things from UDE with this one!

RATING: 7
This one is a winner in my book. Rating moved up to 9 after repeated plays. What a cool little tactical skirmish game! The flexibility to change the action bar abilities makes the unit cards MUCH more customizable. Way to go on this one!

02/03/10 - Rating moved down to 7 since the game hasn't seen the table in a long time. It's not for lack of quality of the game though; other games have taken priority. Since the BGG rating is a reflection of willingness to play, the rating is going down from lack of plays.

01/02/13 - Purchased and received a FULL set of all cards and miniatures from the Core Set and the Spoils of War expansion. I have one of the deluxe boards and terrain tokens. I want to get the other two deluxe boards so I have a totally complete set of all published material for this game.

This is a well done miniatures game.  Playtesting was done by the time that I played it in April, 2008 at GTS, but the game isn't due out until later in 2008 due to the massive manufacturing schedule.  The overall gameplay and mechanics are finely tuned, and it certainly is different than a standard minis game where you build an army based on a number of points.  Instead, the game uses an agreed-upon threshold of "number of models" - so you play a 3-model skirmish, or a 5-model skirmish.  Victory conditions are based on the "Honor Value" of the models you use, rather than a pre-determined victory condition.  There is also a "drafting" mechanic for determining "bonus" items and spells for each character in play, which adds a great replayability factor.I am definitely looking forward to this game.

EDIT:  Wow, talk about an abysmal failure in terms of player support and product development!  I think that WizKids and Upper Deck should have a competition to see who can screw the pooch better on killing a product line.  A great license that Blizzard has given to UDE, and they thouroughly have bunked it out.  This game had great potential, but UDE basically said "so what".  What a waste - Blizzrd should sue them for breach of contract and overall general stupidity, and give the license to someone else that cares!

Nothing here really grabbed me much.  In theory, having all the cards which can affect the powers of the characters, etc, seems like it would create lots of interesting choices.  In this game, though, it doesn't feel like it.  Most of my decisions felt forced and lacking in tactical options.  I like the miniatures, though.

This was a very intriguing miniatures game.  There were two mechanisms that were designed very well.

The first was the Squad Building/Victory Condition mechanism.  Most miniature games require that both sides be built with equal points.  In this game, squads could vary quite a bit in relative value/power because your squad build directly impacted your victory condition.  You need to score victory points equal to the points you spent building your squad.  I play tested a few very "imbalanced" matches with my friends and this system worked out very well in that an "overmatched" squad could escape with a win simply because of the meager success needed to claim victory.

The second mechanism that impressed me was the Timing track.  Each move or action costs a certain amount of time and the Timing track only moves by one each turn.  If you take a really powerful action, it may cost you 4 timing units, which gives me a lot of time to recover and launch a counterattack.  This system really seemed to take an emphasis off of the "alpha strike" that sometimes becomes too important in other games.

As for the gameplay itself, each team starts at their spawn points and works their way across the map to the enemy.  There are some victory point areas in the middle of the field that necessitate both teams move towards each other aggressively.  Points are scored for these areas every 5 ticks of the Timing track.  You also score points for killing an enemy unit.  However, "killed" units are never fully removed from the game.  Instead, they get a temporary Timing track penalty and they respawn back at the team's spawn point.

In short, the game plays very much like a Battleground in World of Warcraft.  I highly, highly suggest the game for anyone that loves WoW, especially Vanilla/TBC WoW.  I got rid of the WoW boardgame from FFG, but kept this gem around.

The game is not perfect.  There are a few issues that caused me to tack some deductions from my rating.  

First, the U-Base system does not work well in a physical sense.  Each miniature is supposed to snap into a U-Base that will track their Time and Health throughout the match.  It's a fine system in theory, but in execution, the U-Bases are too loose and fall off too easily when you pick up the miniature to adjust it.  You need to practice care.  Had this game been produced by Wizkids, the figures surely would have been on Clix bases and that would have been ideal.  Alas.

The second issue that really puzzled me was the Starter set.  There is a small starter set that comes with 4 miniatures (2 horde, 2 alliance), a small paper map, and an abridged rulebook.

My god, was this stupid.  Why would you give me two minis from each side when I need three to play properly?  Why would you give me a map that is smaller than the standard size?  Why would you give me a rule book that won't cover a number of rules I will need to play with the minis that come in the Booster packs?  The rule book in this starter ONLY covered rules that you would run into with the four specific miniatures that came with it.  Now imagine that you buy a booster and get a Druid miniature.  How do Druid forms work?  You won't know because there wasn't a Druid in the starter.

There was a Deluxe Starter that came with 6 miniatures, a nice, matted, full-size map, and a full rule book.  This is the only starter that should have been sold.  If you can still find one of these beauties, I highly suggest picking it up because, despite the flaws I just pointed out, this is a very fun and well-designed game.

Fun game.  Very high quality minis.  The game is customizable beyond just picking out which minis you're going to play.  Each mini has two ability cards and the abilities can be moved around before hand between characters of the same class.  Initial impression is it's an 8, but after only playing 2 games and spending 30 minutes playing I'll wait till I have a few more plays in to rate it.

Its a good introduction into mini games for people who are into boardgames and for children.
Its fun & the mechanics stand though there is a lot of damage going around all the time and not too much variation in the actions. Its quite simple. The time mechanism on the other hand works ok & is worth while.

The production values on the other hand are just loathsome! The deluxe box comes with a nice cardboard board, several counters and minis. When starting to play the game, we quickly realized there werent any counters for tracking the turns on the fancy space on the board. Or to track the points. So we had to go looking around for other stuff. Not really Deluxe!
And asfor the minis. They re not Ugly. But they re not spectacular either and the paint job isnt really that nice. But I dont mind. They re quite cheap too.
What DOES irk me is the Ubase (tm) system. Its appalling how bad the minis fit into the bases. Some dont click into the base, some click in, then pop out doing a slightly spectacular jump. Those bases should facilitate the game; not be a nuisance. And just Because of those bases; you find yourself sliding around the whole board to pick up that base and click it to another value. Which you have to do each time your character does something (to change the time scale) and each time you take damage. Thats a lot. That Ubase (tm) system SUCKS!

And I just loathe the random blister part. A friend bought the deluxe box containing 6 minis, ready for playing; but the 2 factions werent at all equal in strength. No prob, you can buy blisters to build a better game and they re not THAT expensive, but at this time I feel the game will never be really worth the long while. I dont see myself buying it & if had, I wouldnt bother with the blisters. 

Great as a stepping stone to Warmachine or Mordheim or .. though!

Excellent rule system that supports quick gameplay, lot of variety in teams and individual characters, and smart play, especially with timing and positioning of characters. There are dice involved, so there is definitely some luck in the mix, but for me the balance between luck and play feels just about right.

The figs are nice and big, but the paintjobs could in many cases be more detailed. uBases have some technical problems, but once you learn to pick the figs up from the base rather than the fig itself, they perform their task nicely.

The time system is interesting, but it's not sufficiently granular to be as good as it could be. The bases don't work, which sucks, but the paint and sculpts are very good. Not brilliant, but very good.
What I do appreciate is how easy it is to get a functional team out of a single booster. The VP system also seems to balance itself, the Epic/Legendary figures notwithstanding.

RATING: 9
Although it takes quite an investment in figures (including some rather pricey uniques) the game itself is quite good. The timing system, the customization of the abilities, even the sculpts are all wonderful. I really enjoy playing this one, it's just a shame the barriers to entry are so high.

Typical of most skirmish games, the objective is to use your minis to beat up the other guy's minis. Some clever systems intertwined with some boring ones. Honor system is good: the larger your army, the more VPs you need to win. UBase timing is good, the larger your attack, the longer it takes to recover. Combat was Heroscape-simple: attacker rolls, 4+ hits, defender rolls, 4+ defends.

The mounted board was good, one side with terrain, one side without. The UBase had some problems, in particular minis not fitting properly, which means it was tough to keep track of health. Also, the health bar was the worst implementation I have seen. You actually have to pick up the mini to see its health.

The Tick Mechanic is Awesome it enables you to convert Real Time actions or Video Games into a Miniature/BoardGame Format, Id like to see the tick concept implemented in other games.

I gave this game such a high rating not because its perfect (it is close in my mind, but no) I gav it a high rating also because it's systemis so unique and customizable.

customization and Variants are very important to me as I love creating new rules and playtesting ideas.
On that note check out my Variants for this game if your interested.

My version is incomplete, so I can't remark on the game itself much. Seems fun, not totally unlike Krosmaster and the like. I can't truly review it, for I don't have a complete game or anyone willing to play against me - they, like me, burned out on most things WoW years ago.
But, I collect the minis from this game for use in others, particularly the wild animals, monsters, Goblin contraptions, etc. They are high-quality, well-painted, and CHEAP ($1-2 per mini for most) if you look on eBay and such. They lend themselves to re-basing as well. 
So, from the perpsective of a minis collector/game designer, these WoW minis are invaluable. The complete game is still affordable enough, but I'll probably buy Mage Knight before I go for it, to be honest...

ADDENDUM: Having since acquired the (now VERY cheap) WoW miniatures base game, I gotta say: It's pretty fun, and certainly nothing like the protracted, convoluted mess that is the card game. It doesn't top HeroScape or Krosmaster, but it's got Warcraft things in it and (having discovered the series with Warcraft II, but never owned anything beyond the games) it's a bit surreal to have physical objects to represent them there orcs'n'humans.

RATING: 8
I LOVE the way time is handled. The rules are pretty simple, but the addition of the action bars and time system make for some really interesting tactical play.

The minis go from WTF paint job to pretty awesome, so that's kind of a mixed bag. For a retail price of like $5 each, I'd expect them to look all awesome and the fact that some of them just look pretty shit is a big bummer. I do like the larger scale. The system also lends itself well to using other bits and pieces to make some impressive maps and such.

I dunno if I could justify paying retail for it, but it's easy enough to get a good collection of minis buying on the singles secondary market where you can get most commons for about a buck (I also found a few boosters for $4 each).

As you would expect from game with the Warcraft license all of the designs are very strong and paint jobs aren't bad for a mass produced game like this. The gameplay also deviates slightly from similar miniatures games, while it offers the standard skirmish style of play there is also a cooperative automated dungeon exploration mode which can be fun too.

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a team is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

A mano-on-mano beat-em-up game, played in teams. So, one team beats up relentlessly on one character (say yours) using its advantages, you die, you regenerate and come back, just as your partner's character dies, regenerates, comes back. Meanwhile you're trying to do the same to them. If could be considered fun, but it's repetitive and not real interesting.

Played the printable demo version of the game, so the basics of the fighting and 2v2 are familiar to me. Well, I really wasn't impressed of these mechanics even though that master tímer thing was quite innovative. 

Game feels fast-paced enough because of the 7/10 success rate at every rolled die. Remember that I only played the simplest version of the game. 

Anyways, I'm not a fan of collectible miniature games, so I'll probably skip this one. Even though, I won't refuse a game every now and then, because of the low game time.

This game was a really good surprise. It's very well done, with a quite original time-mechanic. Gameplay is fast and simple, yet deep and strategic in-game and - mostly - during the party-building phase. The cards representing abilities, pets, items and equipments are a finesse, giving to the game a fantastic CCG appeal.

Components are so and so: general quality is ok (the Deluxe Starter mostly), maps are good, dice not so much - I like the darker 1s, 2s and 3s on them to represent misses, but plastic and painting are low quality. The cards are well done (eventually they need sleeves). UBases are a problem. And the problem resides mostly in the miniature's bases, than in the UBases themselves. I solved it slightly expanding the miniatures' bases using some tweezers. The result is permanent and definitive, the UBases don't unplug anymore (plastic's hardness maintain the form in time).
Miniatures' sculpts are generally well done, but the painting job varies from quite bad to good.

I have the Core Set and Spoils of War, both completed with all promos, Crafted Cards and many doubles.

Fun little minis game that is fairly standard except for the way it uses a time tracking system for actions and turns.

RATING: 8
While this is probably my favourite game ever, the 8 Rating reflects the untapped potential particularly in the Co-Op PvE Dungeon Crawl/Raid aspect.

If there was official support still working on this, easily rate this game a 10.
It's a smartly done Collectable game, you don't end up with lots of crap figures who are next to totally useless - every figure has some value, even in a completely blind opening tournament style game.
That is because the Victory Points required for a Battlegrounds style skirmish is based on your team - cheaper team equals less VP needed to win.
But will they be able to score those points against a more powerful and expensive team?

Done a lot of custom work for this game including the Arathi Basin map along with Rudi Chelli, Pitlord/Terestian Illhoof/Leotheras the Blind/Archmage Arugal Raids, plus custom characters/cards/figure conversions.

I enjoy Miniatures games but I can't seem to get my head around this one, I want to like this, the components are top notch and the board and cards are beautiful, my only grip about the game components are the figure bases, the figs simple do not work properly with the bases so I made a player mat to keep track of my character stats

Hero Clicks but on a much much better scale.  Miniatures movement are great.  The minis look very good and the bases are MUCH easier to turn. Only problem from keeping this game a 10 is that the minis are hard to keep on their bases.  Careful when you pick them up!  Design of the game is great and keeps to the WoW theme.  My wife and I had a lot of fun killing eachother in this title.

Fast, furious and fun. Certainly better than I expected from a collectible minitiature game. The pros: Balanced forces, plenty of room for tactics, some nice customization options, low on downtime, easy rules, innovative "time" mechanic (for a skirmish game), highly playable with only one starter and two expansions(!). The cons: Paintjob on minis, the unwieldy hitpoint/time trackers set in the bases (which do not fit the minis anyway), ugly artwork on "board". Much, much better than Mage Knight and even a bit better than Heroscape IMHO.

This plays more like a 3D card game than a traditional miniatures game. The design team at Upper Deck did an excellent job translating the online battleground experience into a workable tabletop format. I am also incredibly impressed with the game's balance. Nothing's overpowered, or under, for that matter...and there are competitive team builds for almost every figure.

There are some slight annoyances. The much touted U-Base doesn't work. It's easier just to track hit points and activation ticks on a separate piece of paper. This also means that the game is a little fiddly, but the tactical depth the system provides does more than compensate for any of the component annoyances that might pop-up during a game.

Unfortunately, the game is dead. Upper Deck is no longer licensed to make games for Blizzard's intellectual properties. The TCG was picked up by another company (Cryptozoic) but the miniatures game was not performing strong enough to find a new home. I'm sure pricing played a large part in the game's difficulty finding a fan base. Fifteen dollars a booster was highway robbery for 3 figures, but now that it's dead, you can probably get it for a fraction of the cost. It's well worth it, as this is a pretty solid game.

I Demo'd this game at Gencon and managed to snag an entry into one of the flights. After 4 rounds of play and prodding the designer for an hour of info this game is amazing. The game play has strategic thinking, combo's, and ever popular luck factor that really makes it shine. The "tick" timer really shows how ingenuitive they have come in mini's games thus far. I can' wait for the release.

RATING: 7
Played in one of the GenCon promo tournaments.  A pretty good squad based miniatures gamen with beautiful prepainted figures.  The respawn mechanic keeps it interesting, so people never "feel" out of it.  I'm concerned that the game won't really be balanced (it may be however), as there are some characters/monsters that are clearly better than others.  The game accomodates this by having VP requirements based on the strength of the squad.  However, it will be interesting to see how this one plays out.

In any event, it has the death knell for me - collectibility.  I'm just not going there anymore.

This is the only collectible miniatures game with an active tournament scene right now.  But lack of competition aside, WoW minis is a very good game.  The time mechanic adds a nice resource management aspect to balance spatial maneuvering.  The addition of action bar cards provide a nice gotcha aspect that is missing from a lot of other tournament miniatures games in which armys need to be verified and there is a perfect information.

In the first set, there are very few worthless pieces.  I think I've seen all but 4 or 5 played in tournaments or on Vassal to good effect.  The game seems balanced to a razor's edge. 

UPDATE:  UDE just posted PvE (dungeon) rules on their website.  They work really, really well for solo games.  I think with very little adjustment, they act as co-op mode for 2 players.

UPDATE #2:  Rating dropped from a 9 to an 8.5.  The game is dead now, which is too bad.  The second set overshadowed some of the first sets figures, so it is definitely not as balanced.  Still, a very solid game.

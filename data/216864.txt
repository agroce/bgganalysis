GAME: Card City XL
RANK: 4035

RATING: 8
Initial thoughts: Odd box size, lots of room to breathe... or grow ;) I might try to find a more travel-sized box though. 
The simple game is quite limiting but definitely worth going through once or twice to get the core mechanics settled in. 
Stepped it up to normal and man, it's surprisingly tricky. Like "holy cow I regularly play heavy games and this small card game is making me feel dumb" tricky. Although it's an Alban Viard, so I'm hardly surprised! 
This will probably be a solo mainstay and a permanent backpack game (once I find a more compact box). Great thinky filler.
Oh, and shout outs to AV Studio for delivering ahead of their KS schedule. Between this and Tramways I'd say they're an extremely safe bet for your pledges.

Looks like a small filler, but it is quite weighty, with the I-cut-you-choose mechanic slowing down what should be quick game down. Still, all the variants intrigue me.

RATING: 7
The solitaire game feels like a puzzle, the multiplayer game feels more like a game. The real game comes in when you play under the advanced rules with pollution, corruption and the split cards. Pollution clogs your city, but can be used to get cards in position to grow faster. Corruption adds another layer of bluffing to the I split you choose mechanism. Dual building cards add variation to each game, which changes the valuation of the various cards.

Some of the variants are better than others, but that's to be expected. There are some minor errors in the rule book examples, but they don't lead you to incorrect play. 

Overall, this game provides you with plenty of options to find a city builder to your liking that plays quickly, while requiring you to plan the growth patterns of your city. This does get a small bump in rating due to its well-designed flexibility.

The new version adds in more variants and more cards to spice up the play. I stand by my original comments, but the size of this new box is ridiculously large for its contents!

My comments for the original edition: "Of the three city building games from Alban Viard, this one is the best one to introduce the core idea that permeates all three. It's simple to setup and explain, but tricky to get right. Players quickly admit that the mistakes are their own, but it can be tricky to see how to play well during the first game, given the importance of the first cards you lay down.

Tight, smart game that will be enjoyed by those that stick with it passed the first few games!"

RATING: 5
Another take on a city builder that has the concept of "I cut, you choose" somewhat.  You cut it up a bit odd, but you basically give the person choosing some visible options, and a few that are face down.  You do this for about 12 cards to start the round, which in a 4 player game does feel like it slows down a bit too much since you do it 8 times throughout the game.  The replayability is in the different combo's of new rules you can add to some of the different cards, which does sound cool, and I could see my rating changing based on how much variety those new mechanisms add to the game.  I do think this one is probably more interesting with less players since its pretty much multiplayer solitaire anyways.

First solo of the simple rules was an interesting puzzle. Looking forward to trying the normal and then advanced rules and getting some multiplayer games in. Understand the comments that the multiplayer does not really feel much like a multiplayer as opposed to multiplayer solitaire but I can see tough decisions in the split-2-choose-1.

Backed on Kickstarter.  Estimated delivery December 2017.  Arrived early in September 2017!

I really enjoy the spatial, puzzle aspect to this game.  It really gets me thinking.

I love that even though there are lots of Residential, Industry, Commerce and Leisure cards, not all of them have the same artwork on.  Not every card art is unique but with the differences it makes your growing city more aesthetically pleasing!

This game did not grab me.  It has a spatial component to placement of cards that I do not particularly like.  And you can't plan too much ahead because you don't know what cards will be available to you later.

The one logged play is actually our second attempt at the game. The first game was so botched we had to quit and try again. Our first full play was a dud. The core flow of the game seems easy but the rules then list exception after exception, which seem to exist to make the game work at all. The most difficult exceptions occur around the expansion of the city - expansion of R or C tiles are allowed to break the same tile adjacency rule but still need to honor the other placement rules? The idea of the "I cut, you pick" card grouping mechanism at the start of the round is very nasty with 2 players especially if both players are waiting for the same card. In the end, we didn't have fun playing. Willing to give it another shot or two.

RATING: 7
This is a nice card game about building your own city. The inventory includes plenty of cards with nice graphics depicting: commercial, residential, industrial, leisure areas and parking lots. Also included pollution, parks and mayor’s house. The game can be played in 3 modes: easy, normal and advanced. The rules book needs a reediting since it leaves ambiguities or guesses of what the designer had in his mind. One should read first the whole rules and then start to play; it solves many mysteries on how things work out on previous modes. The first two modes are introductory and almost bland. The advanced rules deal with a more challenging game where placing the right card in the right position can get you wealth or Victory Points; on the wrong place can get you pollution or block spaces resulting in negative VPs at game end. More intriguing and challenging it becomes when players merge their cities into a ‘metropolis’! Variants like: cards that include two areas in one and alternative victory conditions, add more flavor to the game. On top of all these is the solitaire mode where every challenge is a puzzle to be solved so as to reach your goal. It is fun, fast paced and intelligent with lots of player interaction.

Love city builders - this one borders on abstract and can be thinky but I love it!

RATING: 5
The combination of 1. the “I cut, you choose” drafting method making everyone feel like they’re always choosing the "least bad" option, 2. the rules being very restrictive about placement and growth, and 3. the rules for growth and scoring being expressed as mathematical functions (the rule book has phrases like “N+1” in it), made the game feel more frustrating than fun. I think this may be a case of errant expectations, as I was hoping this would be a city builder along the lines of SimCity, but there is no indication from the actual game that it would deliver on that, despite its similar theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Wow, the rule book is a hot mess of variants and advanced rules scattered throughout.  The game is basically a grab bag of rules and trying to piece together which rules are in and which are out and where they are is a nightmare.  

It would have been a lot better for them to simply have a basic game, an advanced one that adds in a couple of things, and then the full game which adds a few more.  But instead you can mix/match from basic/advanced/ful and then do one of the 5 different victory conditions which then makes it all the more confusing

Gameplaywise I like the city building; the tile laying rules made for some careful planning.  

Other than that I felt it was a game that needed to be streamlined with regards to growth, and to rewrite the rulebook so you can actually learn the game.

On my first play I wasn't thinking and screwed up a Leisure building placement which hampered my growth for the whole game.

The growth rules were confusing in terms of districts vs cards and for R growth it was number of L cards compared to R districts, but for C growth it was number of R cards vs C cards or something, it wasn't obvious or intuitive.  Definitely something that needed to streamlined or the terminology needed to be cleaned up.

My other beef with it is that (at least for the Residential victory) you could be screwed over simply by unluckily picking the groups that have no Leisure buildings.  If you don't you won't ever get any R growth through no fault of your own.  It would be better if you could buy a leisure building like you can with Industrial.

I would play Suburbia over this.

A lot of different ways to play..., but as a result, it feels a little unsure of itself and what it wants to be.  It feels a little prototype-y and could benefit from many more design passes, because the potential is present.  Best elements: +The card drafting creates risks that really benefit from player interaction; +Advanced Game; +Ecological Variant.  If the presentation was more user-friendly, the different ways of play would be a lot more appealing and feel more interchangeable.

RATING: 6
You draft build cards into your city every round using a "split-choose" mechanic. The development of the city is similar to Small City in which residential and commercial areas grow to increased sizes (you can't directly just add to them)

The basic game was mainly trying to figure out a good setup to grow from in the beginning and to connect your groups into a big one to score more points. The later rounds felt less meaning full as our cities capped out quickly and there aren't many different types of building tiles.

I think playing the advance modes will allow for some more variability but probably not much as the game wants to stay within it's scope
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I've only played the basic version and I have a feeling that I'd like the more advanced ones more, because the basic game just felt so obvious. Sure, the puzzle of how to grow your city with the special rules is interesting, but given the 5x5 limitation, there's usually not a lot of choices left after a few turns because eventually you'll paint yourself into a corner. I think the dual-sided cards are going to be essential for getting around this, allowing some more manoeuvrability in the mid-late game. The mind games with the I split you choose is fine, but there are better games with that mechanism and there's not a lot of options with the few amount of cards each turn. It's also way too hard to get your economy going, especially if commercial or residential districts are scarce.

In summary, the game starts slow and ends boring, but I'm willing to give it another shot with the more complex versions.

Components: good cards
Complex: easy to learn, easy to start playing
Weight: light to medium
Players: 2 to 4
Length: around 60 mins
Mechanics: City Building and "make offers"
Decisions: quite a lot
Opinion: I love those games about building cities, and Alban has something great to say on this (Love also Small City).
Here we will build a city with cards, representing all of them different types of buildings.
The first to say is that the card selection is awesome... the first player draws cards (depending on the number of players) and makes two sets with some cards face down, second player can choose a playable set or the rest of the cards. If the latter, makes a new two sets following the same rules (all players will end with 3 cards) and the third players chooses. The first player takes, in this case his set, if the second player has chosen the playable set, the first player will make new sets.... until all players have three cards for playing.
And then you have to place them in a grid, following logical rules... people don't want to be near Industry but love Culture, and so on... and, depending on these requisites, buildings can expand by themselves....
The tension and psychological play on the offering is something I love, then the puzzle part is also lovely (did I say I love Small City?), but the offering is just enough to make you love Card City

Only played the simple rules so far but can already tell it shares extremely similar DNA to Alban's other design Town Center.

It eliminates the height requirement and 3D aspect of the elevators and power plants.  It instead seems to replace those with the Industry cards that limit your city growth. In the intro game it does not really feel like parking cards do anything. If anything they are just plugs to keep your city from scoring negative points. 

Unlike Town Center which gives you negative points for building outwards, Card City XL gives you negative points for not jam packing your city's 5x5 grid.

Both approach a similar objective of trying to squeeze the most amount of points out of your city. It does have variants that change the win condition from just relying on maximizing Residential buildings for VPs. 

I'm hoping the normal and advanced rules/variants add more interesting nuances to the game.

So, this strongly reminds me of Town Center just without the 3D spatialization of worrying about what's adjacent in all directions. You basically build a city and try to cleverly place your cards so that they grow. You want as many green cards and blue cards touching like colors, but the trick is you can't place them like that. They have to organically grow. You're also artificially limited to a 5x5 (or 6x6 grid) and the industry cards also limit you to 5 cards they can support. It's a neat game, much more of a puzzle than a game, but it's fairly enjoyable. Not to mention the rulebook adds in various ways to score and alternate methods to the game making the name CCXL quite clever. It's 240 different combinations to play even if they will mostly feel similar.

Honestly, my only beef with the game is the player aids. They're great for the simple game, but once you play the other more advanced levels, the player aids are only partially useful. You can't rely on them to show that you can buy a park or that pollution happens. Nor does it show the correct amount of cards to flip or that the parking lots make you money. They could have added a little asterisk next to those parts and had it be marked as the normal/adavnced game. Or just put it one the back side and had an extra card or two for the money payout based on size of district.

Quite the absurdly large box for the contents. It's a couple decks of cards, money chits and chits with numbers on them. The box is over half empty once punched.

This is a delightful I split you choose game. The active player takes cards, and then splits them into piles of half faceup and half facedown cards. The other players then get to select the pile they want, and then add those cards to their city. During the placement phase there are tight rules defining what can be placed where, but then if you built well, your building chains will grow if their growth requirements are met, getting you free cards, and increasing your ability to score. Playing the original version of this game unlocked my brain's excitement and love for Town Center, which has very similar rules but a 3-d aspect. I'm so happy the designer looped back around to Card City for this new version, adding many super exciting new modes of play to spice up a game that was far too basic in it's original version. If you want to play Town Center or Small City, I highly recommend picking this game up and giving it a play. It's not only a good teaching tool for those games, this version makes it a solid game unto itself.

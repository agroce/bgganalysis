Made this game via p'n'p. Uses the PGG game system however the rules are not as clean as its predecessor with many special rules being effective just for certain turns. A  player aid would have been nice! Its not that much more complex but a bigger game turn track with all or most of the special turn rules printed on it would have made this game easier to enjoy.

RATING: 9
'Classical' SPI design, but with much greater variability in game play, than, say, PanzerGroup Guderian, or Rostov.  Very balanced with both players getting to deal out -- and suffer -- considerable pounding and grinding down. A 'bloody' game that forces players to watch their lines of communication and supply.  Nothing seems certain, even at high combat odds.  A lot of unexpected surprises in the CRT and watch those column shifts.  Forces you to manage your resources carefully and well, while not taking unnecessary risks.  Even so, the outcome is often uncertain right up to the last turn or two.

PGG system. Quick playing, a bit tough on the Russkies.

After further play it is apparent that there are a lot of quite signifigant rules that are often hard to remember and they can make a huge difference to outcome. We mucked up rules on strongpoints, with both of us thinking they had ZOC's, when units are out of supply etc etc.

Game is worth replay though as it is an interesting situation and for the age of the game, has some pretty advanced mechanics,

RATING: 5
A successor of the famed PGG system, and functionally adequate, but somehow exuded a mildly depressing vibe for me. This is likely due to the fact that the Russians get uniformly hammered every game I've played; even some unlikely success in the opening turns stands little chance of holding up to the German counter-attack.  I've never had the Russians get within the same time zone as a possible win, much less the ballpark of such.

One of those games that appears promising at first blush, which you end up playing only a few times to get your money's worth, before abandoning into the "No Play Balance AND No Fun" pile.

One of my first wargames and will always hold a fond place in my heart. Also helps that it's a good game (although the Russian player might disagree). :)

Thoroughly enjoyed it those times I played it. Would rate higher, but I no longer want (or am able) to play games that take a whole day to play any more. If I still played traditional wargames like this, I'd rate it at least a 7.

RATING: 8.7
Only 8 pages of rules but there are some details to pay attention to. Does a good attempt at emulating the Soviet tendency to perseverate and hesitate with reserves. Played solo and though it started slow it did turn in to a slugfest. Map, counters are all SPI classic (that's good). Definitely has high repeatability in play.

Kharkov uses the same system as PanzerGruppe Guderian. But I find the situation easier to play for the Russian (who is the attacker this time) than the German one in PGG, so the rating is better.

Very fun game to play.

A follow up SPI game using the PGG system of hidden Soviet unit capabilities.  A personal favorite that covers and interesting (if poorly) carried out Soviet attack to retake the city of Kharkov in 1942 which saw the use of the first Red Army Tank Corps.  The Germans still have numerous advantages and these are on display in this simulation.  The rules are not overly complicated and the game can be finished in a days play.  I've gotten a lot of enjoyment playing this classic.

An East Front game with a *Russian* on the cover! PTL!

In 1978, this was hot stuff. Works fine as a game, but the history is forced by the special rules. Soloed it once, didn’t feel like I learned anything, and was disinclined to keep at it for whatever deeper understanding was there to be mined.

While this game enjoys its fan and following, I found it somewhat disappointing.  Most games end well before the session is half over; if the Soviet player fails to make significant headway against Kharkov before the Germans launch OPERATION FRIDERICUS (the counteroffensive to pinch off the Izyum Bulge), there's no point in playing on.  Not a bad adaptation of the PANZERGRUPPE GUDERIAN system and the Soviets have a bit more ability than they do in the earlier game.  Definitely one of the better S&T issue games when it came out.

I really like the game as both sides have a decent chance of winning; first game several decades ago had me losing big as the Germans.
With some lucky die-rolls the Soviets will really have it going for them till turn five when Operation Fridericus jumps off.
I still have to try a game activating the southern front early on.

The second of the Panzergruppe Guderian Games, this one allows the Soviets a chance to attack as well. The game system is still solid after thirty years. The follow-on games of the Army Group South Quad are not quite as fun, but enjoyable just the same.

Too dated at this point: inaccurate OOB and map, Strongpoints in this game are handled unrealistically (none at the beginning but can be created during the game- exactly the opposite as happened historically), also has units frozen if adjacent to enemy units (magic spell?).

The PGG system used for a Russian counteroffensive and if you know PGG then you'll be able to get into this game quickly.  It is an interesting situation, but the Russians seem to have little room for error and the untried units system can handicap them greatly at times.  Not a bad magazine game.

The locking ZOC rule guarantees the destruction of the Soviet forces as soon as the Germans get going.  The first few turns feel good to the Soviets, then the hammer (jackboot) drops.  And all the piles introduced by the set-up rules are very annoying.

I consider this game in my top ten. PGG system at its best. Gives both players the opportunity to attack and defend in a very mobile setting. A lot depends on the German set-up, so prepare well. The Soviet player must spend the first few turns as aggressively as possible before German reinforcements arrive. Recreates the ebb and flow of the battle very well. Rules are not particularly complex - highly recommended.

RATING: 5
The PanzerGruppe Guderian system grafted onto the 1942 Soviet Spring offensive.  Of course, this time the defender has a chance to bare fangs.

A very odd shade of green for the Red Army counters!

While I "liked" PGG as a GAME the whole untried unit system just seemed to cry for comment on:
a) incomplete/sketchy OOB and order of arrival info/research
b) an admission of overall ignorance and marked indifference toward the "untried" forces themselves
c) a rather clumsy handling of the "fog of war"

At least in this game there are no zero-strength Soviet untried units.

An intriguing battle that has been understudied and certainly under-gamed.

I have won as russian, against total novices. Otherwise it is a suicide operation for the russian just as in real life. Rather enoyable if you are not competative. I really dont like the very artificial rules that limit the german units in south in the beginning or the ones that does not let the russian to use all his units from start, just to replicate how the real commanders acted. MIHs Turning the tables is better in that regard, but still with the same basic problem. The tactical situation literally forces the russain to put his head into the noose.

This is a decent Panzergruppe Guderian-derived game.  I really like how the Soviets go on the offensive the first half of the game and then the Axis does.  I also like how the Soviets have to balance when they activate the south.

The rules are straight forward and the game has the right amount of chrome.  The game has enough maneuverability and the special zones of control rules help ensure they units don't get too stuck.  The untried Soviet units adds some surprise to the game and makes it more solo friendly.

Nothing really special here, but still a solid, if somewhat dated, game.

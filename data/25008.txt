I'm a big fan of Britannia, so this was an obvious choice. After the first game, I still prefer Britannia. The stacking rules make playing a bit harder than in Brit, but Italia has still a nice mechanic, interesting options as campaigns and is a good alternative for Brit!

Finnaly played Italy I with 3 players.
Area movement-control game.
Lavish components. The counters are gorgeous and the map is like a ancient Wall fresco! A graphic masterpiece!
It was our first game of Italy and unfortunaly we could not finish it (8 turns)  but we were willing to repeat the experience as soon as possible.
looks very balanced but the roman legions are frightening.
Very simple turn sequence.
Each player must be careful with the scripted turn VP conditions of each nation-power.
I believe that for beginners who do not know very well what to do at start, the nation cards give some script and guide to the strategy of each power, just follow it.
To be mastered this game must be played several times.
Diplomacy mainly nonexistent.

Player time: 6-7 hours

Brittania Clone.

Not too bad a clone actually. But current rating is reflected in half an Italia II game done.

Balance of each color has yet to be ascertained, as gamers are still getting the hang of rules and what each faction can actually do. (Or need to do)

Like all simplified games on warfare. The Die rolls on D10s can change the face of a game board. Thus one might jump to conclusions about balance or game play historical accuracy. Attitude of gamers defines the setting of the game.

Interaction between players are good. Believe it will be a great game for a long afternoon.

Need to play more for a better feel of it. Currently, it does not play as well as Britannia.

RATING: 7.5
Britannica variant with minor additions. A pity that in doing so they go the safe way. A radical overthrow of the gamesystem would probably have lead to a better game. I'm glad however that Phalanx finally have produced a real simulation in a wargame tradition! What is missing is a time table in years for historical information. 

In Italia I the Romans gain a lot of victory points without much trouble. The other nations should not forget to submit to Rome in time, raid Roman cities and attack a Roman legion now and then to keep up pace. 

Italia II suffers from too many and too big invasion in a too short time interval. This ruins the game at certain moments while there is little or no time for proper nation building. Maybe that's not far from reality, but that the Byzantines can land in one turn nearly everywhere on the board is a bit over the top. 

What I miss in Italia is a movement phase after combat, so that I can put my nation in a defence mode after battle uncertainty.  

Italia longs 10 turns instead of Britannias 16 and stacking values have been lowered. I believe this was done in order to speed up the game. It lead however to a more back and forth game, so that Italia looks more like History of the World. And that is not a compliment.

A solid 7, for now. First play of Italia I. We got through round 4 (of 10) in about three hours. A little long for my taste, but it kept me engaged the entire time. The great thing about this game is that all players are participating throughout. If you aren't attacking, you are defending, or taking a very short turn trying to just hang on to what you have. Britannia's rules seemed slightly less complex, but not by much. They play similarly. I have more of an urge to play Britannia again, but I definitely want to get through an entire game of Italia soon as well. 

Update: Played Italia I again and really enjoyed it. I may even like this better than Brittania, but need additional plays of it as well. I do agree with the play time complaints. It should be listed as a 4-6 hour game. I would think the only way to break that time limit is to play it regularly. This game just doesn't lend itself to a lot of table time.

Probably a good game in its genre, but does not appeal to me. Combat "roll a d10, each 7+ is a hit, considering the modifiers" adds too much luck to a game with so few units, IMO. The specific rules of each people is a pain to track as well.

I was expecting to love this - Britannia in a new setting with more chrome. Either Fall of Rome (4 players)or rise of Rome (3 players).

Didn't go down at all well. Invasions are more fiddly than Britannia and the downtime seems more extensive.

Much rather play Britannia. Traded my copy, doubt I'll have opportunity to play this again.

UPDATE: I've docked Italia's rating, not because it's a terrible game, but because it's yet another one of those good games trying to escape from bad packaging and bad development. The rules are a mess, but the real problem is the critical player aids - the nation cards - are badly presented and totally unclear, and make the game about twice as hard to play as it needs to be. Compare Italia's pathetic nation cards with the great ones in FFG's Britannia. In many ways I think Italia is a really interesting game, with some great history, but the lousy presentation is a serious problem.

Another problem is the playtime (the box says 3hr; the short game, Italia I, is more like 6 in our experience) and suspect play balance. In Italia I, Red won by enormous margins in both games we played. And by enormous, I really mean enormous; Red almost doubled the second place score in our second game. In every other Britannia game I've played, margins of victory have been more like 5%. With a margin like that, I simply don't believe the game is reasonably balanced. Playing a game like this is not rocket science, and I would expect some easily identifiable egregious errors to account for that level of disparity. But we couldn't come up with any.

This is a game that should have been good, if it could have stuck to its guns of being a shorter, more versatile Britannia; the three-player Italia I is begging to be a 3-hour game, and the concept of having both 3 and 4 player games in two settings is great.

Instead, this is just another overwrought, under-developed game from Phalanx. I've enjoyed their recent small-box stuff, but I am not springing for a big-box game of theirs again. Regardless of whether it has potential or not, I wouldn't play the game Italia actually is again.
---

Played Italia I only. A split decision: I really like the history of Italia I. I think it does a better job than Britannia in portraying the rise of Rome. But our playing time, even for this shorter game, was still too long - we didn't get to the last turn in a 5-hour session. Part of this was grappling with the game - most of the nations are far more complex in play than their counterparts in Britannia, and the player aids are weak (I'm being generous here). And the rules are just edgy enough to be an issue.

I saw enough potential there to set up another go at it, and hopefully just a little experience will bring down the playing time to under 4 hours. If so, this will be a keeper. If not ...

Interesting Britannia variant with best components of all Britannia variants. However, not the best in the series. Adding cities, fleets and campaigns seems like a good idea, but all it does is make the game too complex - especially the campaigns are a drag.

RATING: 5
Essentially [i]Britannia[/i] in Italy, but with a heavier rulebook and lots more chrome. All that extra chrome might seem neat at first (as it did to me), but the net effect is that it adds a lot of complexity and mental overhead. This makes it especially difficult for newbies, and generally just annoys the more experienced wargamers, who certainly aren't going to get any sense of realism from this game anyway. The poor player aids do not help, either.

Another thing we found annoying was the scoring system. Whereas Britannia was fairly consistent as far as when and where you scored points, in Italia there is usually at least one race scoring points every turn, and sometimes its at the end of the turn and sometimes its at the end of the nation's turn. On top of that, you have to be careful to count cities vs areas properly.

The net effect of all the chrome, constant score checking, not to mention the regular major invasions/campaigns, is a very long playing time. You're looking at 6-7 hours for Italia II, which is far more than a game with simple mechanics like this ought to take. I could even tolerate the longer playing time, but for all the downtime the other players have when the major invasions or campaigns happen, and they happen a lot.

Mind you, some of these issues may go away with an experienced group of gamers who play it regularly, and are very familiar with the rules and the general flow of invasions. Unfortunately, I'll probably never know.

Andreas Steding has added a lot of chrome to the "Britannia" game system here, but avoiding some overly complicated mechanics that made "Hispania" very long to play. Still, this "Britannia" on steroids - the decision making is much more difficult as there are lots of things large nations can do on each turn: raiding, naval moves, building cities, campaigning. The latter mechanic simulates the long campaigns of Hannibal and the like, something like a mini game in the game as other players can react to the ongoing campaign moves, also something that has not been seen yet in "Britannia". 
Where the game shines is in it's 3-player scenario (or rather "game" - as the 3-player version is completely different from the 4-player version), which is the first time this has been done right, with basically two sides representing the nations oppressed by the Romans that constantly struggle among themselves, and the third player representing mostly the Romans in their struggle to dominate the peninsula.
Game material is top notch, although there are some strange omissions (like a historical reference or an overview over when all nations/armies appear). THe rules are not for the faint-of-the-heart - even Britannia veterans will have some new concepts to struggle with, although they still will feel at home. Recommended, but not for the casual gamer.

RATING: 5
I think the lesson learned here is that making Britannia more chrome-y does not make a better game. The base system works because it's simple - it's meant to be simple. This series of games already has a long playing time. Don't add to it!

Moreover, people tend to forget the fiddly rules - the naval supremacy rule is a big culprit. And it doesn't help that the wording of some of the rules on the nation cards are vague and hard to understand. 

Oh, and yellow is really screwed.

Uses the Britannia system but fails to make it clear and playable.  We stopped the game which is something that rarely happens in my groups but everybody could see that this turkey wouldn't fly.  Not bad but nothing to grab you for the time the game requires.

Tried again and went the distance with the Italia II version.  Lack of balance between the colors made for a painfully dull gaming experience.  Game is now retired.

RATING: 7
Update: It's long playtime has kept it off the table.


First impression.  Italia is a little more involved (naval rules, campaigns ect) than Britannia which makes it a little more work to play.  However the period of ancient Italy is very interesting and I like how the campaigns sweep areas of the board.  My biggest problem with the game is the play length of around five hours.  I'd love it if it would play in three and a half hours.  Its a beautiful game and you get two sets of units for the three player and four player version.  Nice counter artwork and map as well.  I expect it to rise with additional playings.  If I have four players I think I'd still play Britannia first (its parent game) due to its simplicity, but three player Italia is a great alternative.  You really get your moneys worth here.  You just have to be willing to learn some rules.

Beautiful game components - the presentation of the map and counters is outstanding.  This doesn't include the play aids-I wish the designers of FFG Britannia had gotten with the Italia designers.  The FFG play aids are outstanding, while the map colors and counters are somewhat questionable.Anyway, this is Britannia with more chrome, in a very interesting environment.  Play 3-player as the rise of Rome, or 4-player as the fall of Rome.Update:  Italia I looks like a major cake-walk for Red (Rome), and Italia II is a major disappointment.  The campaigns and massive major invasions are fiddly and a source of downtime for all of the other players.  The chrome of special rules and scoring for each power over and above Britannia adds time and headaches without really increasing realism or strategy.  The size of the invasions and the campaign allowance of huge stacks makes this feel much more like History of the World than Britannia.  Combined with >6 hours of playtime, this is just never going to be played again.

"Britannia-style" game, covering the early history of the Italian peninsula. Two separate games, in fact: Italia I is a 3-player game covering the Roman Republic, while Italia II is a 4-player game set much later, at the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The game is more complex than Britannia, but complexity seems to be reasonable.

Not a bad game but too long for what it does (Italia II - 4 players). Even after 12 hours divided in four sessions to complete our game we still made mistakes and had to look up rules repeatedly. I haven't played Britannia yet but the three other guys all agreed that the added chrome of Italia doesn't add enough fun to justify the increase in playtime and rules complexity. Coupled with questionable play balance (blue and red too strong) and the need for an experienced group to evaluate board positions correctly this isn't likely to see more play.

[2006.Dec.29] Tentative initial rating. This Phalanx Games release is based on the game system used in Lewis Pulsipher's Britannia. While that game focuses on the British Isles, this historical wargame is instead set in (and around) ancient Rome. While it can be played as either a 3- or 4-player game, the unique thing about this wargame is that these two modes of play encompass different eras of Roman civilization. So in actuality, there are two distinct games (using two completely different sets of game pieces) in the box; they simply share the same game resolution system (and game board). This is quite an innovative approach to solving the problem domain of properly managing game balance when having differing numbers of players (in this case, 3 or 4). As can be expected from Phalanx Games, this game is another high-quality production with a beautiful game board and precision cut game pieces. The eye-catching art by Craig Grando--whose work can be seen in Against the Odds games--is quite refreshing and only enhances the overall flavor of this product.

In both the 3- and 4-player versions of the game (Italia I and II respectively), players control multiple nations or tribes (between 2 and 5 in Italia I, and 4 in Italia II) vying for control of the Italian peninsula and its surrounding environs. The game is played in only 10 turns with the winning player being the one having the highest victory point total amongst all of his nations. While the resolution system is not overly complicated, the time required to play is not insignificant. That said, if you have the time and players available, do not hesitate to delve into Italia. {7}

Virtually Roman history in one package.  I played Britannia and thought this system was quite OK.  Craig's graphics is a plus.  In fact, the mapboard is hard mounted to the AH's glorious day.  I hope more games like this could be produced in future.

I have been keeping an eye on this game for a long time. The designer uses the Britannia basic game system to design this game and Hispania to portray a nation's history in one go. 

The grand strategic decision is different and interesting each time you play a different side. This game captures Roman almost 1500 years of Italian history, from 330 BC to 1100 AD. Jesus Christ, yes, he was born in between...

The game is very colorful and has 600 cardboard game pieces depicting 30 nations coming and go in the history of Rome. All significant leaders, even the lesser known, are included. Forces are generic and players score VPs on area objectives and winning battles on specific turn. Timing is important in this game. There are actually 2 games in one. The early Roman history is in Italia I where 3 people play. The latter Roman history (with Western Roman and Byzantium Roman) requires 4. 

After one play of Italia I, I should say I heartily recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the entire Roman history.  You can really recreate it with this game.  Excellent game design.

It takes literally forever to finish. I've actually played 5 games of it, but only finished 1 properly. I'm having problems finding people to play it with me.

I've made variant of Italia II that can be played with 2 players - for me and significant other - but I only had one opportunity to test it. She said she liked it, she even crushed me in the end (hate those Franks), but I still need to see the day to play it again.

After a play . I find it too long (in the 4 player version); on play balance I can't say anything, because you need some game under your belt to have a really competitive game, as in Britannia. The campaign rules (a kind of entry move for some nations) are not difficult, but in a game of this level maybe are too much: so it cannot be a good choice for a beginner. The background? Ah, it's wonderful! If I give it another try is because I love this historical period. And map and counter are exceptional, both in graphic (a bravo! to Craig Grando) and quality.

11/22/08 Played 6/10 of one game of Italia I. Its nice, but all the chrome and special rules bog it down. I prefer Britannia and Maharaja. Insufficient/not up to par game aids. The owner had to make several. And no historical notes or dates the turns cover??? Shocking. My initial impression of the counters were very favorable. But that was before I saw two tribes of the same player adjacent on the map. Then it was difficult to tell them apart without close scrutiny. The map is very nice though. The tribe cards are too small, ditto the font used on them. And printing on the back is not a good idea. Most people forget to ever turn them over.  

04/17/10 Played 6/10 of a game of Italia II. I like Italia, but it takes too darn long. I estimated a full game would have taken us 7.3 hours. We gave up after 4.3.

The gameplay itself is intriguing, maybe not the best accurately historical simulation out there (and I don't understand the point in removing the time table) but it's a funny entertaing grand-strategy game nonetheless. Good to have 2 games in 1 (based on the historical period played).

Played once with four players.  I thought I'd like it more than Britannia due to the additional stuff going on, but I ended up liking it less for the same reason.  Ten turns jam-packed with special events and exceptions to rules...ugh.  We had to constantly readjust our thinking instead of falling into a nice, Britannia-like rhythm, and twiddling our thumbs during the campaigns didn't help matters.  Britannia's less diverse but faster-paced sixteen turns make it a more enjoyable game with a much more reasonable duration.  Also, in Italia, the colors seemed rather unbalanced, with red being a bit too powerful and green being pitifully weak.  I suspect this game would be better with three players (and the difference is probably big enough to make a numeric rating unfair at this point), but I have so little interest in playing it again that I'm not going to bother finding out.

P.S.  The rulebook and information presentation are among the worst I've ever seen.

Very nice and well produced game - tense, too.
If you like Britannia, you will love Italia. If you do not like Britannia, then stay away from this game, too.

Britannia-style game of Italian history, including Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily and Tunisia (Carthage). The early three-player scenario covers the rise of Rome until Marius and Sulla. The later four-player scenario has the invasions of Italy from the fall of the Roman Empire to the arrival of the Arabs. As with all Phalanx games the counters and mapboard are lovely, and the rules are pretty straightforward.

Played one game of Italia II, which had to be ended early (turn 8) Blue won easily. Has serious downtime problems, especially for Red in the mid-game.

Had a terrible experience playing this game. It is the type of game that makes people sit down and think every freaking move for hours on end. After explanation and play, I had three minutes of play in two hours. I quit a game for the first time in my story of playing. Not the kind of game you want to teach and play on the same day, and most definitely not the type of game where you want to optimize every move. The advertised length three hours if the players go at it quick, but with the players I went with it looked like we would not finish if we played the whole night.

Italia is an excellent simulation of Italian History around the time of the Romans.  The rules are complex, and not for the faint-hearted.  It would be much more accessible if there was an Italia III set of much simplified nation cards that come with the box for beginners.

Warning:  There are a [b]HUGE[/b] number of pieces in this game.  If you like [gameid=240] then you will like this one as it is a worthy re-implementation.  Italia offers two different games inside the box:  a pre-empire three-player game and a post-empire four-player game.  Both games have a strategic scale, but play is highly dynamic and interactive.  Production values are high.

Tentative rating after one play of Italia I. I want to like Italia, but the game length, and myriad of special rules on the nation cards, made for a difficult experience. And I don't know there's enough game here to warrant the kind of committment you need to play it properly. See Session comments.

I prefer the history setting and the slightly more detailed rules of this over the excellent Britannia. It's just an hour too long for me to find opponents wanting to invest the time in this over the many other excellent games out there.

I found the rules easy enough to follow - having played Britannia recently probably helped, as does a better understanding of the the various groups here than the ones in Britannia. The enjoyment of the game does depend upon players who can make fast decisions and keep the pace up. Playing with opponents who have read the rules themselves helps greatly - playing experience helps even more.

Sadly I just don't have time to bring this to the table often enough. Great theme. Easy to follow (even with all the different groups and their various abilities and victory point objectives). Fun if you can play it fast.

An advanced version of Britannia, set in the mediterranean during the Roman times. There's actually TWO games in it: Italia I for 3 players covering the rise of Rome, which very nicely circumvents the difficulty of getting 4 players for a longish game, and Italia II for four players, covering the fall of Rome. In general the games are a lot more "cluttered" with rules than Britannia and also much more heavily scripted, sometimes resulting in very ahistorical situations, but once they open up thje going keeps getting better and better, even stealing play time from Britannia itself!

Map is wonderful - both clear and serves purpose very well. Counters are nicest I have seen for a long while. Components seem to serve their purpose, including aesthetics (in my opinion, very important in this genre). Rules are extremely simple and straight forward. They do fine based on one game. Indexing of rules is non-existent (which I kind of understand due extreme simplicity), however references to history and missing designer notes is not so positive feature. 

I fail to understand what is the utter complexity of the rules some people are talking about. Game flow is smooth and our test game (two player variant of Italia II) took about 5,5h to finish.

Played my first 3 player game of this 07-16-2011.

My thoughts are as follows:

Production 10+ the production values on the game is off the hook mounted map nice thick well printed counters it a pleasure just setting up the game its that nice!

Concept 10+ a sweeping swath of Italian history in one game it just drips with theme and history.

Instructions 7 Could have been better though far from the worst set I have seen. Certain things are glossed over and certain concepts are not addressed etc.

game play 8 system works although some things seem funcky. In most cases leaders are only eliminated through combat. Thus its possible for a leader to last a whole game. The game covers hundreads of years of history so on the surface a leader can "live" for 300 years?! Also certain historical events are simulated in strange ways. Example Pyrus shows up and stomps all over the Romans but on the following turn Rome receives 14 legions as reinforcements effectively nulifying any lasting effect Pyrus may have had. However, in the designers defense trying to simulate a swath of history and insure certain powers retain the influence they need to acomplish that simulation is always going to be tricky. As I said the system works and all in all I like this game.

Over all rating 7.5 for now may go up or down with more play time.

Italia is strategically interesting, and  the history is well-presented and mostly flows naturally from the rules and the individual goals of the player nations.  It's not easy to simulate hundreds of years of history, particularly when whole nations rose and fell within that period.  The system that works in [gameid=240] works well here, too.

Unfortunately, the game is riddled with exceptions, special rules, and rough edges that weren't caught in development.   Cities, navies, campaigns, and lots of DRMs are nice historical chrome, but slow the game down, and should have been either excised or simplified in the name of playability.  The game also has common criticisms of imbalance, particularly in Italia II, which matches my experience.  There's also game-y exploits and holes in the rules, particularly for campaigns.  I've had more fun treating this as a game kit, when I felt liberated to make quick rulings rather than try to figure out what the official rule should be from the incomplete rules-as-written.

The component quality in this one is up to Phalanx's usual standards, with beautiful art and thick counters, as well as a high quality mounted board.  I really miss a few items from FFG's printing of Britannia, especially the at-a-glance nation summary and turn order that's printed on the board, as well as the exceptionally clear player cards and streamlined VP chips.  I can't say I'd recommend this game over Britannia or [gameid=7480], but if you're into the theme or the system, it's worth a try.

First play. Rulebook and player aids have some annoying errors. Rulebook could have been clearer on a few issues. Not a big fan of the "campaign" system as it causes lots of downtime for the other players.Still - I want to play it again... I have better hopes for the three player game (only tried the 4-player). Don't think it will go lower than 6... and it might raise up to 7 or 8.

Just as good as Britannia. There are tons of rules -- every round has rules and scoring conditions. The first (and perhaps 2nd) game is a learning game.

A nice upgrade of the game Britannia covering the development of Italy.  The nice part is there are two scenarios scaled for 3 and 4 players.  For a 5 player game, stick with Britannia.  Very nice components as expected from Phalanx.  Not a lot of new ground over the old classic but cities and naval combat make for nice additions.  Still you can expect a long 3-5 hour game playing it to conclusion.

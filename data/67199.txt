Got components early for play testing. It's still amazing how the old NLB game is grown up and fitts the modern use. All the old things are in there, BUT it feels absolutely new! 
It's a Kevin Zucker, nothing more to say!

...If you want to get a little further, try Markus Stumptner's refit: a new rule-variant. All for the game (rules, new counters, markers, etc.) at: http://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/user/mst/games/lbn/lbn.html#refits.

Finally arrived..just in time so I can claim it as a gift thereby placating the QMG...(purchased Jan 2011).

On the table March 16. Setting up Jena without cards and vedettes initially.

After some solo play of Jena the verdict is good. The rules are a little fiddly and need some close study, but the game flows smoothly.

Initial Impression: There was alot of research put into this game and it shows. The maps are very detailed, and OOBs accurately describe the armies involved in the conflicts. The rules are fairly simple to learn but proper application and ramifications of the rules require some insight into Napoleonic tactics. Although the individual scenarios are interesting, I'm dying to play out the entire campaign, as the rules allow for a feeling of continuity.

10 Plays: Each battle offers a different experience, and I highly recommend to play the "Approach to Battle" version of the battles, with cards. This method allows for some interesting and challenging variations on history. Although solitaire play is fine to study the battles, I'm finding that playing against an opponent is more fun. I have yet to tackle the Friedland engagement.

RATING: 6.5
Hit and miss update, accompanied by much hoopla, to the classic Zucker Nap battle system.  

Excellent but not great counters;  a shame the Russians, in historically accurate brown overcoat colors for Eylau, are then understandably off color for the summer battle of Friedland.  I would have gone with traditional green, given the rest of the graphic conservativism.

It is also disappointing to still be getting 1972 sand-colored maps, when Eylau could have easily been done snow white or non-glare snow light gray, and Jena/Friedland done in farmland yellow/light green, befitting fall/summer in Europe. The counters would have stood out more, and the whole game would have benefitted from the psychological base color facelift into the 21st century.  I bought the game in large measure to get a Friedland battle, but the pleasure of playing it will be diminished due to the significant "just doesn't look right" color mismatches noted.  Yeah yeah, your mileage may vary, all in the eye of the beholder, but the graphics bottom line for me is the package has aesthetic choices/glitches I just can't shrug off easily.    

Card system adds color but also some head-scratching; many of the tactical possibilities are a challenge to get enacted on map, many are ho-hum most of the time, and the reduced movement allowances add to the mental bookkeeping overhead.  VP penalties add some choice angst, but also detract from the cards' appeal.  Stacking rules encourage mega stacks which are touchy to handle in the standard size hexes -- not a gripe, just an observation.  

The Supply trains and VP penalties for losing your own LOC/Supply hexes are a welcome addition, and prevent ahistorical freewheeling armies just careering about each other in an effort to gain a flank.  Still, overall, the new stuff adds more rules burdens, and loses my cost/benefit analysis for "extra time invested vs. added fun/realism?" involved.  The updated system finishes a notch above break even to the classic system for me.

I use the rule of Markus Stumptner with this game, because it seems better than the original rule. Very nice game, with counters and maps of level! Interesting for large battles due to the brigade level.

Great components and a very manageable system. You don't get the full hidden movement experience solo, but it is a neat system including command control and  supply. Slightly let down by a 'classic' system for combat which felt a little 'off' - very hard to damage units, unless you can surround and destroy through failure to retreat. There is some nuance around Shock results and reduction through bombardment, but it did feel as if an attrition-based system would be better. However, great fun and easy to play, with the cards adding flavour without driving the results (for example, scattering your troops at game start, allowing a re-roll, or providing ability to slip out of ZOC).

This is my favorite entry in the LNB system.  It has a solid group of interesting engagements.

Comments on the LNB system in general.  

This system builds on the success of the classic Napoleon's Last Battles.  In solves the few issues that system had and provides a great value in a Quad format.

Unfortunately, the rule set has experienced, and continues to experience significant creep.  One would think that after all these decades the optimal balance would be reached, but as the designer has said it's like a fold in a rug, you push down and it pops up somewhere else.  

Additions like vedettes, hidden units, cavalry charges, supply trains, cards, and unit initiative have their strengths and weaknesses.  They're overlaid on a rather archaic ZOC/CRT chassis and the argument could be made that many of these updates simply aren't worth the bother.

Bottom line, we play a la carte, deciding which rules to use and which to ignore.  My opponents and I don't play with the cards for example.  If one wants to make a cavalry charge or break off vedettes they can, but the truth is there's rarely an advantage in doing so.

I rate games in this series based upon our way of playing them.  I'll grant that this may be sub-optimal play as over the years we've needed to become comfortable with a series of changes to the system and perhaps not all of those have" gelled". If the system received a significant overhaul that streamlined it a bit while modernizing the ZOC/CRT system; these games would probably rate a point or two higher.

Very good installment of grand tactical Napoleonics era battles. Game simulates all important factors of Napoleonic battlefield: fog of war, reconaissance, supply lines, cooperation between different arms. Cards provides necessary unknown data: possible reinforcements, battle events etc.
Lack of knowledge, manouvering and marching, deploying troops to battle. All this happens in Coming Storm. Highly recommended title and I hope to get all titles in the series. Good work Mr Zucker!

Love this system.  I've been a fan of Kevin's Campaigns games for years.  This has always struck me as a "shallower" system than CoN (most of the really big decisions have been made by the time the battle happened), but I'm revising that opinion after several playings.  The randomness introduced by the cards is excellent, and the hidden units make for games that are not forgone conclusions.  Can't wait for the next one.

Deux scénarios joués seulement (Iena et Friedland) mais un système qui tourne parfaitement malgré la lourdeur de rédaction des règles.
Je suis fan donc difficile pour moi d'avoir un jugement objectif sur le système des combats.
Dans tous les cas, les parties sont palpitantes pour ceux qui apprécient la manoeuvre.

Start to love this system over T&G/JdG. 
I used to think that lacking unit facing is a minus. Now I think it does not matter as both sides are still trying to envelope each other. What matters becomes where the concentrate of force is.

RATING: 7
Good: Operational / Grand Tactical (brigade level) - Napoleonic - Easy/Medium

Plus:
-Like other Kevin Zucker games, components are top notch, beautiful maps  & counters. 
-Very accessible system (20 page rulebook)
-Great replay value due to variables that are integrated into the system: activation of leaders & units, fog of war (stacks are visible but of unknown  strength) and there are the cards. All of this ensures a different game each time you play.
-There is a campaign module where which link the scenario's 
-Cards allow for uncertainty and you can also play the game without them
-Four very interesting and very different battles
-The game succeeds in translating the system and components to the get a real good feel for the battles and hence it is very evocative.
-I like the scale better than 1806 as there is much more space for manouvre.
-Very evocative
-I like the streamlined vedette rules   

Minus:
-Steep price if you have not pre ordered (goes for 120 Euro here in Germany) but in return you get 4 separate games.
-The scale for the Jena & Auerstedt battle is perfect. For Eylau and Friedland it works perfectly fine as well but especially in these 2 battles I would love the be able to see the crucial Regimental engagements that had a big impact on the outcome of the battle. Anyhow, this is beyond the scale of this game but maybe an interesting idea for Kevin's future games series.
-Maps are very functional and high quality but could have done with some more artwork like Four Lost Battles, which is more colourful and I don't understand why this is but I assume it is a budget thing.
-Due to the hidden information there is the counter flipping but wooden slides would solve this very tiny minor issue.

Bottom line: 4 great games form an even greater designer in one box and you can link them for a Campaign!

Mind you, this is not exactly the same system as four lost battles, it is more a simplification (e.g. rules for Vedettes have been simplified / streamlined). 

This is really great stuff and an incredible series is in the make that cover each Napoleonic Battle on brigade level scale.

I am really glad Kevin got the inspiration for these games and he can keep 'm coming.

The only danger I see is that the budgets of the potential buyers might not be able to keep up with the pace of new games being released (next game is already anounced for April). 

Traded for 3 games on my wishlist

If you like Nap last Battles you will like this series. If you hate the rigid ZOC, kill em when they retreat into my ZOC of the classics, stay away. However these game captures the macro operational feel of Napoleonics in a fairly rapid playing package. A good simulation at the Corps, Army level.  Playing with the hidden,limited intelligence rules makes these games a truly memorable experience.  The variable reinforcments and the mini-campaing sceanarios make the games fresh and different. Also the current CRT/Bombardment tables made the game more dynamic than earlier editions

EYLAU-7-8 February 1807 
FRIEDLAND-13-14 June 1807 

The first game after Kevin Zucker, the designer, announced his retirement from wargaming but then relaunch his game in Oct 2010.  All the battles have been well-known to many as they have been covered in many magazine games before.  OSG game always strike the balance between simulation and gameplay - fun while exciting.  I have almost all the games in the collection of the series, except for those battles in Italy.  This game contains 4 standard maps!  Hefty price too.

The Grand Tactical system is very good both game and simulation wise. The system is rather easy to learn and it is streamlined. Supply rules might feel a bit extraneous on this level but they give a sense of history and work very well in relation to victory points. There are four battles in the box and each battle can be played as a one or two day battle. There are also rules for a campaign, which means the replay value is more then good. All game components are good but setup charts are needed and hexes could be slightly bigger.

Funny because I played this one after playing The Last Success.  Instead of Austrians this features Prussians and Russians (oh my).  Out of the two Coalition forces, I found the Russians to be the most tenacious against the French but playing the Prussians to be a satisfying challenge against the French.  Beautiful components: maps, units and cards really make these OSG Quad games shine.  Fine historical commentary with sited sources are a plus to history buffs.  As a Grognard I found working through the rules not too much of a challenge and with recent updates from fans and the designer just enhances the gaming experience.  The four battles presented play well with the system.  Haven't tried the combined Campaign Game but look forward to it soon; Eylau is truly a brutal affair for both sides and worth another play or two until that time.

Another Zucker Napoleonic wargame. By this time, you are either a fan of the system or you are not (since I rated it an eight, obviously I am a fan). The surprising thing about this particular game in the series (surprise for me anyway) is that the Prussians are pretty tough and can stand their ground quite well. Eylau is probably my favorite in the box because it is not everyday in wargaming that you are fighting a battle in a snowstorm!

This may be the easiest game to learn the system because if you play the battle scenarios, most of the tough decisions are already made and you can watch the battle unfold as you learn the game. In fact, this feature also makes this title a good solitaire choice as well.

Steep price but it includes four battles and with the cards which add a lot of friction and uncertainty, replayability is ok. The rules have improved somewhat since Four Lost Battles, but they can still be awfully vague and messy. In spite of that the game is actually fairly simple, maybe too much so, it plays fast, focuses on maneuver more than tactical combat and while I wouldn't mind a bit more chrome or a more modern system (it really shows its age), in the end it can produce decent historical results.

Sigh. A great example of how to kludge up a clean and fast-playing system with layer upon layer of chrome until it's crushed under its own weight. Series rules are up to what, Version 6.71 and counting? This AFTER the game (and another subsequent game in the series) required an upgrade kit to make it compatible with the seemingly endless errata and tinkering. But hey, we got cards!

RATING: 6.86
The system is nice and an evolution of the 6 days system. The scale allows for individual bombing or charging decisions which enhance the gameplay. I play solo and choose to leave the cards apart. I acknowledge though that they may help replayability. The four battles seem faithful to History, and in the case of Jena, that makes the game a bit dull for the Prussian side. Eylau was a great experience, with a strong Russian opponent and many opportunities to score something against Napoléon.

Game turns may not be that fast to resolve because attention is drawn to placing units and not to reading the rules, which is nice. Each scenario has an alternate version lengthening the time span of the battle and allowing for a different setup with different units from the historical one. That gives a nice what-if situation and adds value to the game.

The components are beautiful. The counters are of the same standard as the recent OSG games and make reading a battle quite easy. The maps are splendid but may lead to question what the terrain modifier is when a hex is of mixed terrain. I think that a winter version of the Eylau map would have been great: lakes and streams are almost useless in their summer form, and frankly that does not help me to feel the frost bites of an uninviting battle.

I would recommend that game system for anyone fancying a Napoleonic wargame. It is easy enough to learn for beginners, and technically satisfying for experienced players.

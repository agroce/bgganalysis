RATING: 10
My favorite WWII system is the Operational Combat Series, but the Battalion Combat Series is making a serious challenge to my number 1 spot.  Finishing turn 5 of the campaign game which is fought over 4 maps.  So many tough decisions to make and the game does flow very nice and fluid.  If you don't want to play the long game, try a 1 map short scenario.

Have really enjoyed this system. Just a sublime mix of innovation and solid design. Constantly making meaningful decisions. It restricts what you can do with your formations without a ton of rules that just strap you in for the ride and leave you as a passenger.

RATING: 9
One of the most innovative games I've seen.  It takes a bit to wrap your brain around the rules and how units are really supposed to function properly, but once you get into the flow of the game it really makes you think like you should at this level of operations. The components are outstanding.

RATING: 9
Excellent game, and an innovation in design. My one quibble would be that the rules are written as if you're playing an old SPI IGO-UGO ... that is, it seems to assume familiarity with and previous mastery of concepts so they are not fully defined or explained. Such concepts as Support, Engagements, MSRs, etc. are all new and yet not really well covered.

Just a bit of solitaire counter-pushing so far, but seems really promising. As much as I like OCS, the abstractions and details here seem much more authentic (and far better than the much more problematic TCS). I hate the terms "design for cause" and "design for effect", which I don't think mean anything. The question is, do the systems model something interesting, or are they arbitrary? To me, the models in BCS so far seem really good. Although the scales are slightly different, this really hooked me in a way that GTS failed to do. BCS is also interesting because it's at a much more personal, evocative scale than OCS. When the Tigers and Shermans start trading shots on the engagement table, you can visualize what that encounter looks like. You can feel the rising fatigue, the momentum (or not) of the SNAFUs and continuation. What the game chooses to model makes it feel more immediate than the average counter-pusher.

My favorite game on the Bulge is Mark Simonitch's Ardennes '44, and that is unlikely to change. Last Blitzkrieg is a monster, and you'd need at least 4 players to do the campaign. There are a bunch of good scenarios, which is nice (and not always something Dean is good about doing), so there should be good play value in the box for us non-monster-gamers. I hope the series has some legs, and I look forward to something that isn't quite as huge. I suspect this one is a winner, and I also look forward to seeing how it evolves - OCS has only gotten better and better as it's been tweaked over the years. BCS feels pretty solid, but I can certainly imagine that it might get even better as players come to grips with it.

Why 6? Well, Dean Essig is a genius, his systems are the best ones, but this BCS  has got too many details and they are often useless. I have wanted to compare Wacht am Rhein with Last Blitzkrieg. The SPI system still rules, thanks to its elegant playability.

Excellent: WWII Ardennes - Operational - Medium / Difficult

First impressions are really good:
-Usual good quality old school / functional maps & counters
-Some very interesting and original concepts
The scale is perfect for me
-System has the right balance between detail and playability.
However, unit strength seems to be odd (smaller and larger units same).
This game has great potential and system will develop further.
Still very positive and still need to play more to make final judgement.

Own and play all "gamers-titles" and I find this series at least as good as OCS. Once you have learned the system ( be patient, but the reward is a very intuitive system) it makes for an absolutely excellent system. Brilliant for soliataire and AS only 1 division is active at a time you can play for 1/2 an hour, leave and do stuff in the real world and return and go for next activation.

Initial impression: While I'm HIGHLY critical of the one-sided historical research in this game (and most other of The Gamer's WWII titles), this looks like it might be THE battalion scale game that we have been waiting for. It incorporates all the good bits from old classics such as Aachen and modern games like Celles.

The game is one of the best simulations of operations/tactics at the Battalion level. I found I was making the same kind of decisions that real world commanders would make for the right reasons (and not to get a 3 to 1 surround if you know what I mean) The game brings the Green Book to life! The combat system rewards planning and focus on the overall objectives vice short term gains. A couple of minor  things bug me....one is that a unit with just one step is just as good as a full strength unit, (but that is what house rules are for :-) ) And the other is the lack of color or other markings to distinguish different major formations.

RATING: 10
Having played scenario 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, I think I can already rate this game : it fully deserves a 10. 

Why?

Because I have seen my counters advancing on the game map like real units on a historical situational map. Because combat zones can be blocked by burning wrecks, and road network choked with traffic. Because of the swirling engagement of armored units. Because enemy tanks can engage targets at long range when I am unable to respond. Because my armored support have engaged enemy tanks against all odds and stayed, and, because my armored support have been overwhelmed and have been dropped. Because my recon forces were unable to uncover a tempting target. Because artillery can slowly grinding down enemy units by barrage fire. Because artillery can suppress defense. Because artillery can deliver destructive fire during an attack. Because my exhausted divisions were unable to advance through a gap in the enemy frontline. Because I have mixed my formations so badly that they slowed down to a crawl as they tried to dress their lines of attack and main supply roads. Because the game have combat trains, the SNAFU table and no Supply Points.

And all of these with simple rules and no odd-based Combat Table.

Play this game.

Last Blitzkrieg is the first game in the promising new s Battalion Combat System (BCS).  The rules reflect the system's newness, referring to as yet undefined concepts far more often than other (V2.0 and higher) MMP/Gamers series.  Otherwise, these are the usual super clear Dean Essig rules.  The example pdf on the Gamers website is a big help.  There are some conflicts on bridge repair dates between the map and the game specific rules, but no other obvious glitches.  

The BCS system has the best multi-formation coordination and supply route conflict mechanisms I've seen, with much lower overhead overhead than in OCS.  The terrain modifiers are rather generic, however, especially compared with DG's Wacht am Rhein, a game which gives you the feel of driving across the real Ardennes. In BCS the terrain is a bit more important than in GMT's Ardennes 44 though.  Battle complexity of BCS is also midway between that of Wacht am Rhein and Ardennes 44.

The maps (four!) are the usual Gamers easy-on-the-eyes style.  Likewise the pieces are Gamers standard with NATO symbols.  Formation coloring of those symbols would have been a HUGE help given how important formation membership is.  Still, you can get by fairly well squinting at the formation designations.  Maybe the next game in the series will get this feature right.  It's certainly become the standard in other series where formation membership matters.

RATING: 10
Possibly the most realistic system at this scale I have ever seen. I like GOSS, but the BCS is incredibly engaging and the decision presented are surprisingly accurate. I particularly like the slow collapse of formations' ability to operate effectively over days of continuos engagement and the way infantry and armor combat are portrayed. It also necessitates planning... actually planning is the quintessential part of the system to just achieve something...

This is the first in a brand new Dean Essig series. I would have preferred a topic that wasn't the Battle of the Bulge but I was interested enough in the series concept to give this battle another look.  Initially I thought it would be interesting to compare this to Wacht Am Rhein, which is a physically beautiful game with an enormous level of detail - but with a big learning curve.

The scale of the units and size of the two games is similar.

But this thing is an instant classic.  Total elegance in the way it plays. Brings the battle to life in the same way as a good book on the subject.  The campaign is playable and fun.

Awesome.

This seems like a really exciting and interesting system, at my favorite scale. (I think obsessively playing The Longest Day as a teenager made me love battalion level) I'm still trying to get a grasp on the rules, and how everything comes together. There are a lot of new concepts - thankfully, some of the playtesters have put up some excellent learning aids. Doesn't seem that complicated compared to the the Civil War RSS stuff, or even OCS...just a lot of new terms and ideas. I agree with some other commentators that the rules could be organized better. This will probably improve as the series matures. 

The entire campaign is impressive looking, but huge. So glad Dean Essig has gradually moved toward supplying quite a few smaller scenarios. The campaign seems, like many monsters, to be best played by several people working as teams. (And you'll need considerable table space for all four maps)

RATING: 8.5
An interesting and elegant game design that keeps the focus on the actual combat formations within a division. There are numerous design elements that make this system worth a look.
Game play has each side activating 1 division at a time then the opponent chooses division to activate. This alternating structure continues until all formations have been activated. Divisional cohesion is rewarded in play via enhanced capabilities.

While it is a monster game, it plays reasonably rapidly for a game of this scale. Also a plus is that the game has come with ample single map scenarios that cover elements of the conflict from the early days, the middle and the end. This aspect will really assist those who are challenged for space. In this capacity there are minimal charts that need to be set up with the game.

I look forward to seeing where this series heads.

This is the first new system from Dean Essig in years and the scale is one that is rarely done in other wargames. The only other current system I know of at this level is GOSS and this system is hands-down better than that system. For those two reasons alone, I think it is worth taking a look at. Personally, I would've preferred a smaller battle to learn the system on but the Bastogne scenario looks like a good intro. We shall see.

Two things do bug me about the presentation of the game. The lack of color-coding makes this game more of a pain than it should' be to set up. The other problem is the lack of colored set-up charts and instead, relying on 70's-era setup charts (I put the un-color-coded unit on what hex again?). In the year 2016, there is really no reason for this. I hope further games in the series advance into the 21st Century in terms of setup charts.

This game looks really good, I just started the rules and I am trying to follow the examples but I think I need to read all the rules before I understand what is really going on. From what I have seen so far I am very impressed, the rules for SNAFU, Supply, and activation's are certainly different from your standard hex and counter war game. I also really like the different combat modes and how they are meant to complete different objectives. Changed my rating to a 10 because this game is #7 on my Top 10 in my BGG Profile

Interesting gaming experience, but long with plenty of opportunities for AP. I enjoy it but certainly not for everyone. Probably better playing with rules that speed up the game such as fast trains, no new load cards until the end of yr turn, loans allowed.

This is an interesting (if older) title made even more so by the brilliant solo rules in the file section. Highly recommended!

RATING: 9.5
Played SO many times in the 80's.  This and Cosmic Encounter were our staples then.  I'll play any time.  I'm surprised at how long some of the times are that people talk about here - maybe we just played it so often, we did not have to over analyze. I agree that it's not a short game.  Funniest thing is watching a newbie strand themselves immediately, after a detailed explanation of how and why not to..."start again".

While this Crayon-Rail(CR) is a good CR to start with new players, I just don't find it as interesting as later CRs, which feel slightly better balanced on contract locations and payouts (in my opinion of course).

RATING: 6
Tried a two player game to see how it works... it was an interesting experience, although too long for my liking. Hitting up the western corridor and getting good options to the east seem crucial. How well that was done determined our winner in fairly short order. We ended up calling the game early, b/c neither of us wanted to take the next ninety minutes to see that guy end up with 250 million. I will play this again, b/c I want to see if I can do better. But really, I'd rather be playing Age of Steam.

A very entertaining game but be prepared for a LONG evening, especially with standard rules. We always play with fast (double) speed trains to move this game along.

Empire Builder came out in 1980 and I'm afraid it clearly shows its age. Now to be honest, this game is NOT new to me this month - but since I haven't played it since (about) 1984, I'm going to count it. EB is the (?) classic crayon rails game. I don't mind that aspect. What I dislike is the brutal opening for those not experienced. Get some deceptively harsh opening cards, you can quickly run out of money and have to appeal to the mercy rules. By the time you recover, you're pretty much permanently behind the leader(s). More than that, it is cruel in length of play even if you take nearly simultaneous moves. For me, the length of play just doesn't deliver. There are several moves where you are simply running your train down the road while others take a long time to determine the optimal route/goods delivery. Steam and its older (wiser?) brother Age of Steam do what Empire Builder did, but with more smarts, better decisions and yet still gives you a full route building/train moving experience.

I own several versions of this and many other of the rail games from the series. I find it best with two players as the game will go quicker. I am amazed at how often I can play this game with a friend of mine and either he or I will miss winning the game by one turn. It makes you see how important each decision in the game will shape your future. I'm also amazed at how one person can be so far ahead of the other and then all of a sudden the other person can catch up. It is a very balanced game. Sometimes we like to play without the random hazards for an even more strategic game. If you play it for the first time you might not like it but it can certainly grow on you and has a nice relaxing pace. I find that the enjoyment is also increased greatly by buying the laminated map of the game and using wet erase markers for drawing the lines. Crayons are so frustrating to use and a pain to wipe off. To speed up turns we also made up a rule that a person only gets to draw track or move, but not both in a single turn.

The classic cranyon rail game.  No two games alike since you get different cards each time.  Key is to build only enough to get cities connected and then hope to draw those runs that occurs on your line only.

The game itself is fine, but it lasts at least twice as long as it needs to.  I like the core mechanic of drawing a card, looking at what good makes the most sense to deliver, and then delivering it, but it gets super repetitive after about the fifth time.  Unfortunately, it takes about twenty deliveries to win the game, not five.

Parents got this for me when I was in about 5th grade. It's certainly an interesting game. Now that I'm older, I see that I like a little more player-player conflict. It's a little difficult to stab people in Empire Builder, and that combined with it's long play time is this games downfall.

Pretty neat to see the rails slowly spider over the entire map though. Gives you a sense of how the rail system might have evolved.

Fun game.  Would be played more if it didn't take so long (3-4 hours).  This gets less table time since Ticket to Ride arrived in our house, but it still has its own unique flavor and hey, it is fun to draw on gameboards with crayons.  This one really feels like building an empire of train tracks across the United States.

This game took way too long to play. I, and another person, were learning how to play it from a couple. They had played once or twice beforehand. Interesting idea of drawing a railroad all over North America to make connections, but it is annoying how few times the commodities you had in your hand were close together. So, you either had to take a chance and carry something that you didn't have a card for yet, or you did lots of running around empty or only half full. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game is very easy to learn and very unique.  It does require a good 2 or more hours of investment to play (though there are tips for shorter games).   If you haven't played any of the Mayfair rail games this is a good introductory one, though the subsequent versions are better balanced.

Rating based on one play and I loved the game.  My gaming partners liked it very much as well but we all determined that it took so long to play (even with every shortcut suggested in the manual as well as BGG user suggestions) that it most likely will not see the table at my house again.

[b]Edit[/b] A year later I got the wife and oldest kid to play with me a few times and once you get over the curve the game flows MUCH faster.  I love this game even more.

One of the "must own" for rail road game freaks.  This game is good, but not great.  I feel theres not enough incentive to run on other players rails and it's usually cheaper to build your own rather than do this.  Replay isn't as high as you might think with a game that allows you to make your own board.  Fun though.

I'm coming to this game a little late, having played dozens of games that have directly or indirectly built off of this classic game.  Still, the mechanics are enjoyable.  Building your own track network is fun, maximizing your pick ups and deliveries is fun.

Having said that, this game is nevertheless one of the most mind-numbingly boring games I've every played---and I only played it two player!!!!

A big problem is phase order.  You deliver an order and then draw a new card and then have to formulate your new plan then and there, as it is now your build phase and you have to have a plan to know where to build.

Also, there just isn't enough going on here.  Once you've made your plan for the next X number of turns based on your cards and money and routes, you just have to wait torturously through other players turns as you carry it out.  There's really nothing else to think about from turn to turn, nothing to come up to change your plans.  Except for events...

Add to all that a group of event cards that do nothing but make things HARDER to achieve and thus slow the game down EVEN MORE!!!

Ugh.

I would probably play this game again, but I'm bringing a GameBoy or Crossword puzzle to play between turns.

The original "crayon rail" game. The map is of North America including the southern strip of Canada and a good portion of Mexico (in the latest edition) and is a grid of dots that are linked using a player coloured dry erasable marker. Also included are goods chips of many types and a deck of delivery cards each having a choice of three delivery orders (take good X from City Y to City Z for a specified bounty in dollars. Several different train type cards that can carry different loads and at different speeds complete the bits.

Players construct their networks by rolling dice and connecting the dots and then moving their pawns (representing your train) along them. It may be necessary to use an opponent's track which comes at a cost. A hand of delivery cards forms the basis for your actions as you plan your routes and string together deliveries. As deliveries are made, the associated card is discarded and a new one drawn. The luck of the draw is very large here along with efficient planning around what you've been given.

Beer and Pretzels rail game. Gateway to more solid stuff...

RATING: 9
First time you can play can be very intimidating, especially when you play with an experience player. After a few plays (knowing where the cities are, the strategies, etc.) it is an absolutely great game. One of the first resource management games I ever played. You try to make the best with what you've got. And playing with crayons is always fun. However many people won't like it because there are hardly any interaction between the players. But if you are in the mood of playing a building game, then this is the game for you. Best with 2, 3, or 4 players but anymore can make the game really long.

RATING: 6.5
Overall, i thought it was good, but for the length I was hoping for more depth. Also the board needed to be enlarged by 1.5 times.  Initially I really liked drawing my rail lines and building the network.  However, it became apparent as the game continued that there wasn't much depth after that.  After drawing your rails in order to make some initial  money, you then work to connect 6 major cities (earning money as you go), from there it's just a race to make the most money.  The random event cards didn't do enough for me and I can see the randomness of them annoying me. Really want to play this again though.

Played once w/ 2.  Also played Euro Rails once w/ 3 and once w/ 4.  Overall: seems more fun with more people, although I'm sure there is a limit.

While I actually find the Crayon Rails games fairly dull in general, I actually think they work quite well with 2 players. I have enjoyed all the games with 2 players (except maybe Iron Dragon, which is a bit big for 2), while with 4+ they definitely seem to drag.

I love me a good pick-up and deliver game, and this definitely fits the bill!  For how simple your available actions are, it's surprisingly brain-burny as you try to find the most efficient ways to turn your cards into cash.  This would be an 8 or 9 for me if it wasn't so darn long, although I must say the time flew right by!

I haven't played a ton of train games myself and none of the 18xx but I do enjoy this one very much.  Its a crayon train game where you literally use a crayon to mark you track on the board.  Its a neat aspect that I enjoy by its self. The fact that you can transport Bauxite, just makes this game awesome by its self. Expect to commit a good amount of time playing as it equals to about 1 hr per person.

Pick up and deliver game that requires patience and planning.  Largely solitaire however, there can be competition for building lines to cities, occassionally.  A time commitment is required but very satisfying to see your cash build up.  Not suitable for young children due to the time requirement and to the continual counting and abstract representation.

Based on one play. Started the game late when we needed a shorter game to fill the evening, so we had to call it quits early. Must note that we were playing a simplified quick start version of the rules, so I have no idea what play with the official rules is like. I had just gotten into the groove of play when we stopped. Not crazy about the crayon / drawing mechanic - I think I'd rather use sticks like other train games. Lots of deep thought about routes made the game challenging, but also a steep learning curve to start.

Crayon rail games are conceptually brilliant. However when you figure them out, like anything, the interest wains and so long term this isn't a game that holds any challenge.

I really like this game. The mechanics and feel of the game are great. This game is similar to Railroad Tycoon. I thought RT was fantastic but it seemed klunky. It is nicer to look at than this and overall not as long but it left me wanting more. This game did not. I know it might be me but this is the best rail game out there but it can be a bit long but it is worth it.

Overall Score 8, Appearence 7, Components 6, The Box (storage) 9, Rulebook 7, Ease of Play 7, Mechanics 8, Involvment 6, Replayability 7, Uniqueness 9, Luck 4 v Strategy 6 (The higher the number the more it leans that way.)

I actually played this a long long time ago. I don't remember enough of what I thought of it to be able to fairly rate it. Wouldn't mind giving it another try but given that other rail games are either significantly shorter and still quite good (Steam, Chicago Express) or only marginally longer and amazingly good (18XX) I'm not sure how this would fit into my gaming [i]lifestyle[/i].

Best use of crayons in a game!  Update: After not very many plays, I'm a bit burnt out on this game.  I dislike the hazard cards, and much prefer the game without them.  I also prefer the fast-trains variant to keep the length of the game reasonable.

Update: The SoloPlay variant by GameRulesForOne works quite well.  In fact, I would probably rate this an 8 solo.

Comment from Iron Dragon:


	
I don't understand the appeal of any of the crayon rail games, on turn 2 someone was eliminated because a bridge was washed out in front of him and you are not allowed to turn around and he had no money to rebuild (it was only the second turn) and so that was it, he was out. The end game was sort fun, but the 4 hrs it took to get there was worse than getting teeth pulled, I will NEVER play one of these games again!

Way more fun than it seems like it should be. The decisions to be made are a little infrequent, only coming when you get a new order and plan where you're going next, but I like this game anyway.

I think I like this game best with 3 or maybe 4. More than that drops the rating a bit, just because of the dragginess factor. Although, my 5-player games have been with slow people.

RATING: 6
The tragedy of crayon rails is having your play dominated by the random turn of the cards.  For years, we played a variant that you could not pick up a commodity you did not have a delivery for... a desparate attempt to add more depth to this pretty shallow first offering.  At least it's easy to know where all the cities are.

My friends and I like this game a lot, but it's LONG.  VERY LONG.  Using the base rules, I estimate play time to be approximately 1.5 hours + 30 min/player.  But playing with fewer than 3 is no fun - no competition for small cities - and 4 is the minimum to provide competition for both small and medium cities.

Perhaps my least favorite of the crayon rail games that is played on a realistic map.  It's nice to know where everything is, but it lacks some features that make other maps more interesting.  It is better than the fantasy maps, which I don't care for.

RATING: 8
Although it can at times feel like a multiplayer solitaire game, there are enough important decisions to make in the game for me to like it a lot. I'd play it a lot more if it didn't take so long to play. If I could find a good variant that cut down play time to about two hours, I'd bring this out much more often.

Mayfair.  Solid, good railroad game.  This is a gamers game as each player must manage their money, build their track, and get loads delivered to specific cities.  If mismanaged development of one's side occurs, the player can essentially knock themselves out of the game.  Empire Builder plays in an evening and was the catalyst game for a whole line of additional railroad games created.  Players use crayons to connect dots and build their track.  This is the first in this series and was very widely liked when it first debuted.  A fun, but involved heavy euro style game by today's standards.

I love the crayon rail system. It let's you create your own route anywhere on the board. It's a very free feeling. The only negative is that it takes a little too long (I like to reduce the target money to win) and it's a little too much of a solitaire experience.

Fun game for me because I enjoy route planning games.  However, it's LONG and sometimes seems like a lot of work to start making money.  However (again!) everyone tends to start making money at about the same time and about the same rate, so the ending is usually tense and filled with uncertainty.

Seems like every time I play it I bump up my rating a little bit.

Empire builder can be a real brain burner on your first play.  It ended up being a fun play with a lot of tough decisions.  I like how the game encourages competition without having to go out of your way to screw the other players.  It is more of each player trying to be as efficient as possible & avoid running of money while you are getting your tracks built.  It is a very good game, but way too long for me.  Empire Express, however seems to keep most of the best parts...while shorting the game a lot.

After 2 plays, I find this game to be a lot of fun.  The challenge (and best part of it) is optimizing your pick-ups and deliveries.  That said, the optimization process can slow the game down causing player downtime and game length to increase.  I don't think it is any more than say Torres or Tikal though.  This game has so much more flavor, that it is a must play.  In our 5er game, no one was really crushed by an event card.  If this happens often (which I don't think it will), I could possibly see this game dropping to a 7.

A classic game, and we used to play it to death a few years ago... But now I think it's just too long for what it is. And cutting down the money needed for victory doesn't save that much time since once you get established you can get from 100 to 250 in a hurry...

Also alot of luck in terms of what cards you get, and no real way to catch the leader.

Actually there isn't too much strategy in the game, the outcome depends more on luck, but it is great fun to imagine you're running a railroad. A very simple railroad, it is nothing like a simulation off course, but still great fun. The only downside is that when a player made a wrong gamble, like having no money left to repair a bridge after a flood, then that player is practicly out of the game. According to the desired playing time the rules can be adjusted (also suggestions in manual) to speed the game up a bit.

I've lowered this rating because this system is boring. I love the look of the map but the mechanics are pretty dull. Move, drop off goods, take money, draw, repeat for 2-3 hrs. I think if the game only maxed out at 2hrs for 5 players it would be great. Although I'm not really sure how you would do that. And then there are the event cards which do make you more careful about planning your route but in the end just make the game longer. 

I know there are a lot of big fans of this game and I did love it at one point and it deserves credit, but it is not for me anymore.

This game is boring.  Really boring.  The beginning is a desperate, brutal struggle, to the point of frustration, but once you get your engine up and running, the game becomes an exercise in tedium.

Played 3 times. My first crayon rail game (although I have played Funkenschlag.) Liked the thinking behind it but was surprised at how much luck there is (in the card draw.) Not necessarily a bad thing though. Basically this is an ever-chaging logistics puzzle, since very little interaction actually takes oplace between the players. Doesn't mean it's not fun though -- it like playing a puzzle on the same board.

RATING: 7
This is too long for its own good.  We decided to shorten the finale to $200 because as the game wound down, it was getting obvious that we were just in a race with the luckiest draws determining the winner.  I'm pretty sure there are choke points and key routes that should be exploited.  I liked the experience but I can see this getting old unless it is played with variants.  Note to the wise: don't get stuck pennyless, but it won't kill you to shove your hand to get better demand cards.  Ones that fit your own rails mainly...

RATING: 6
Interesting from an historical point of view. By today's standards, however, it fails to distill the "fun" of this type of game and the winning condition makes it either too long (by the standard rules) or too random (by the "short game" rules).  That is not to say the game is not fun: it is. It is just too long for its own good.

While I dislike the luck in the card draws and the limited options due to them, I did enjoy the game. I also do question the depth of strategy in it as it feels like there is a clear path. All that aside I found it a fun activity. I didn't get to play a full game so it may end up being too long for what it is, but it is fun.

This is a good game of medium length (perhaps 2 hours for 2 players). Two or three player game is probably best. I wouldn't play with more than four because it just gets too dang long. More players adds a bit more interest as small and medium towns only allow 2 or 3 players to build into them.

Has an old time feeling about it (obviously), but I like it, as it is a different mechanism.  Sure, you can really grind down with the AP, but its also a game in praise of slow.  The rules are very simple, and its just a something fun to do.  That said, X-Y coordinates locating the cities is amazingly wrong, which really is annoying to this non-US player (Rating: 7.181, Dec 16)

I was shocked to discover this old gem is still available.  I thought my brothers’ old torn up copy was the last in existence.  We had many fun nights playing this one.  You draw/lay your own track in this game. How can you have a train game without laying your own track?  Lowered rating due to long game play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The games in the series were very fun for me for a while but greatly diminished over time.  Drawing tracks with crayons is fun.  The downtime waiting for others to agonize over where they will draw their tracks isn't.  Making a strategy for optimal load distribution is somewhat fun.   The downtime waiting for others to do the same isn't.  Having others re-draw their destination cards and either causing you to dump your loads and thus goof up your plan or when they pull a card that allows them a big payout without moving isn't fun either.  

Overall this is a game that's fun for the first 10-20 playings then rapidly goes down hill.

In some ways, Empire Builder is the very model of a train game. You build track, make deliveries and upgrade your trains.

However, it is also very slow and very tedious. It's not much of an empire when you just have one train.

Age of Steam and it's family play much faster, at least for me, and you have more of a sense of running a rail line, not just one train.

With friends that love this game, I decided to alienate it away to someone else who would like it more. I think the mechanic is fun, perhaps especially for children.

RATING: 7
Fun train game.  Rating reflects how often I'd want to play not necessarily reflecting quality of the game.  I find the crayons messy and clunky but also fun!

Production still feels cheap despite the new edition.  Kudos to Mayfair for at least coloring the resource chips to make playing easier.  In play, cards can make or break you, but it is easy to decide not to use them.  Also not a great deal you can do to interact/interfere with other players, expcept building prime routes first.  That's okay, but feels a little solitaire.  Never the less, I enjoy this one once in awhile.  I can't deny that.  Probably simple enough for families with kids to play.  Might hold their attention, if you employ the fast play rules.  You could even leave out the event cards if you wanted to house rule that.

This is my mom's favorite game.  Mom, my wife, and I play this game a fair amount.  Recently we have taken to using one small modification to the rules.  We deal five demand cards to each player during setup, and you must discard down to three.  We find this tends to mitigate the insanely good, or horrendously bad starts some, and generally tightens the game up a little bit, without unbalancing the game.

The crayon system is pretty clever... the freedom to go wherever you want makes for an interesting puzzle every time. I think it's probably ideal with 2 or 3... any more than that and playing time will get out of hand. But while I'm playing, I find I don't care how long it takes. Maybe I'll bump it up to an 8 some day.

I remember playing this back when it first came out, long before the "euro game" craze, and did not realize this was a watershed design. After playing Iron Dragon and loving it, I decided to revisit the original. It is much, much simpler and more forgiving. However, because of slow trains and mediocre contracts, it seems to take a lot longer to get going. Because of this, it has an "epic" feel to it. It is the quintessential "traveling salesman" optimization game, and I like it a lot. Playing with fast train rules (bump up trains to "12" and "16" respectively, and playing to $200M instead of $250M) and mercy rules, a 4 player game can be reliably concluded in 3 hours. A 3P game can finish in 2.5 hours! The short time makes it feasible to play this on a weeknight, after work. Because of this, our play of all crayon-rail games have gone up significantly. It is possible to play to $250M, as this only adds another 30-40 minutes. We have incorporated the fast trains in all of the Empire Builder series, and experienced roughly the same manageable play time. 3 players means more room on the board, and a more leisurely pace, while 4 players gets crowded fast with furious competition. With 5 or 6 players, the downtime is too much, such that the feel of the game play suffers substantially.

It is highly recommended to use this as an introduction to other crayon-rail games; it is easier, more accessible, and more forgiving, with less rules, than the others in the series. Then, moving up to complex titles like Iron Dragon and more brutal maps like Australian Rails is relatively easy.

Argh.  I would rate this lower, but there isn't anything really wrong with the game.  It just took a god awful long time, and although I yelled for people to hurry up, it really wasn't anyone's fault.  This game is merciless in money matters early in the game, and if you don't watch every dollar, you're screwed.  Hence, you count fifteen different ways to make track work for you and then have to weight the cost/benefit of the longer route that's cheaper, or the short track that's 2 dollars more.  What's 4 movement points worth?  2 dollars?  who knows.

I love crayon rails, and as the original crayon rail, Empire Builder deserves some respect. It has a pretty straightforward map without many special complications; I like the North America map better than the old one because choosing whether to go to Mexico or not is one of the major decisions of the game (it's all about the coffee).  

Empire Builder doesn't really have big deliveries, so the game doesn't have the same kind of economic turning point that many of the other crayon rails have. Also, it's possible to get screwed pretty badly early on.  In my first game on this map, we had to stop the game in the middle because two of the players were unable to continue. So, it's not my favorite crayon rail, but it's still a crayon rail and I'm still happy to play it. (4 plays)

I used to like this game a lot, but after about 200 plays my interest waned. ¶ My high school buddy and I wrote a program that generated cards at random. That was in the 1980s, so they printed out en masse on a dot matrix printer and we sliced the pages. I no longer have the program, but I still have a big envelope stuffed with "cards".  They were ugly, but it was worth it to make the runs (and events) less predictable.  Sometimes we'd play a variant with a ridiculously low starting cash, so that you traded your hand a lot, and the challenge was to get your rail network off the ground at all. That was amusing, but probably not much of a game.  I am a strong advocate of the "cost to load" variant rule (my own invention, which got my name in the Credits in the 1988 rulebook). Paying cash for a product is too steep a price, but with no cost at all, players are forever loading up their train with an extra product on spec, and that detracts from the game.

 EB feels more like a real train game than say TtR. I sat down the other night to play a three player solo game to get familiar with the rules and the game itself. It wasn't long before my wife was passing by the table and asked  what I was playing. After a brief explanation of what I was trying to do and the rules, she was as she said, "Hooked", and was soon playing one of the three players. I do wish something could be done about the crayons, I always feel like I'm going to break one. We used poker chips instead of the paper money. Very tight game economically-especially at the start.

Played with optional, advanced and variant. I own the original version. One of my all-time favorite games as I played it constantly for a long time.**** Sold in a bundle at auction ORIGINS 09 and got royally screwed. 3 ORIGINAL games (Empire Builder, British Rails, Australian Rails) with mounted maps covered in acetate for grease pencil, 6 painted trains for a grand total of $26. I should have just thrown them in the trash.

I'm sure this was THE pick-up-and-deliver game when it was published in the early 80's. However, games have come a long way since then. There is a lot of hunting-and-pecking for where you can pick up goods and deliver them. The game drags with higher player counts and even at lower counts, the monotony of the hunt sets in. I can't ever see myself bringing this out over say, Railways of the World. If I want a simple, crayon-style train game, I think Dampfross (Railway Rivals) is more unique and faster paced. Although, granted, this game has a bit more strategy than that one.

This is one of the first games my wife and I played.  Many happy memories drawing our tracks with cheap crayons. Still s solid game, but just a tad long for it's complexity level.

The game definitely shows its age.  The components are not that spectacular, and I just tend to dislike drawing on the components with crayons (one of my complaints about Atlantic Star).  I'm glad to have had a chance to try out one of these games though - I can see why people like them.  The planning is fun, but the luck of the draw is so big (at least in the game I played) that a lot of the importance of planning goes out the window.  If someone keeps drawing cards with big payoffs that happen to work into the planned route, they will do much better.  

I enjoy the game, but the big factor for me is time.  I felt that we played quickly (in a 3 player game) but it still seemed like it took too long.  I felt engaged the whole time, but I was also winning by a landslide.  Had I been in the other players' positions, I think I might not have felt so interested in the game.  I didn't feel like there was much of an opportunity for them to catch up or for me to slow down, since the game is pretty solitary in nature.

Another aged long train game, perhaps a step up from Rail Baron. There's some sense of progress to building your network (and this is where a marginal amount of player interaction happens as well), but winning depends on drawing the right sets of demand cards in the ensuing race and not being hurt more than anyone else by the event cards.

RATING: 7
Fun game that is somewhat educational in that it gives you an overview of US (and part of Canada) geography.  The cards provide a random element that can bankrupt players early and leave them far behind with little hope of catching up.  The need to cooridinate your runs and the decisions of how to build your routes make this game interesting.

Suffers a bit from run-away leader issues which can occur if one player gets better cards (for more cooridinated runs), but game length and multiple decision points mitigate this.

RATING: 7.5
Most of the games in the Empire Builder line seem to add a feature or two not present in the original, but they are all cast from the same very enjoyable mold. I have only played the revised version with Mexico, so this comment is based on that map: It is difficult to compete in this game if you don't start in the East, but it seems like there is always one player whose initial cards push him to try to build out from Mexico, and that person always seem to struggle to find viable delivery options while the other player(s) are building extensive networks on the Eastern seaboard.

I have played most releases in the series, but haven't played any one of them a lot. In my limited experience, this one seems to offer a little less of a variety of potentially successful starting positions and strategies than later editions.

Many crayon rail games that have followed in this ones footsteps seem to address that issue a little better. On the other hand, familiarity with the geography means less time hunting around for cities which helps keep the game moving faster.

Much better with fast trains variant otherwise little too long. Also suffers from noticeable downtime especially with more then three players. Anyway time spend with this addictive game is a great pleasure.

To speed up the game we play with 12/16 trains speed. To reduce lack factor we don't use events and we start with the choice of 3 out of 5 contracts.

With original rules I would reduce rating to 6-7.

A fun game that rewards good planning and strategic laying of routes -- as it should.  Components are quite humble.  Though the game is not as unforgiving as some other rail games, non-gamers and newbies may find they have spent all their money before finishing a network that can reliably generate income.  Based on just a few playings seems like it is better with more players.

RATING: 5
My first "crayon game" experience ever and the crayon system didn't impress me. Our game took 240 minutes (including rules) and somehow the excitement disappeared after the players (5) had build their railway systems. The rest of the game (almost two hours) was just pick-up and deliver -stuff where the luck of cards had a big part: with right kind of cards you might get a lot of money; otherwise you just need to throw them away and take another set of cards. At the beginning there were something fun to do, otherwise it was more or less "not so good" experience. I'm quite sure, that I don't play this never again, because there are much better hardcore railwaygames available (Age of Steam, Volldampf... anyone?).

RATING: 4
We picked up a 1984 copy of Empire builder from the local thrift store...game production has made massive strides in the last thirty years.  The tokens were thin paper and difficult to sort.  The cards were also out of thin paper stock and difficult to shuffle.  The board was made up of separate pieces that fit together like puzzle pieces and literally looked like graph paper (although I think even the most recent editions have kept this visual aspect).  Let's just say that it wasn't the  most attractive game to look at.

Nevertheless, we gave it a shot.  Almost immediately, my wife disliked the game.  Part of the reason, fair or not, is that she was not born in the US and so had trouble locating different cities on the map.  It was also tedious looking up which city produced which goods in the rulebook, although I'm not sure if there could be an easier way to represent that.  In our first game, she also made a fatal mistake of over-spending the first few turns and then remained stuck with no way to generate any income.  This caused us to quit and restart (somewhat reluctantly on her part).  The economy of the game, especially at the beginning, is quite tight and new players could get stuck.

The next couple of games went more smoothly, but it just didn't work for us.  Adding to the tedious nature of the game was that it felt like we were only doing a few things over and over again---draw cards sometimes, build some track, move your train, rinse and repeat.  There were only a couple of train upgrades you could invest in, so it didn't feel like you could really specialize.  Midway through the game, we had a large network of track and we were literally just moving our trains back and forth, over and over again.

Perhaps if the game were shorter, we might like it better, but for us it felt too long for what it was.  It just wasn't that interesting.  Maybe there are better pick-up and deliver games out there?

Crayon Rails is an old classic game.  You spend money connecting cities and delivering goods on your train.  It is a pretty easy game to learn but there are some good choices.  It has a pickup and deliver mechanic. 

There is very little interaction in the game at low player counts.  But it can be a little long to play at about 45 to 60 min per player.  I can run long, but usually once you have built to 6 of the 7 cities, it takes 10 minuted per player for the game to end after that point.

I like the crayons better than the game play.  Way too much downtime for way too little meaningful decisionmaking.

Poster-child for "long and repetitive games can be fun too". Planning out your routes and gauging their profitability is a good time. Sometimes it's frustrating how long it will take to get across the board but filling the map with rails and pulling off high paying three cargo routes are a blast.

Visually and thematically unappealing, and the crayon-on-laminated paper format is just plain chintzy.

6.0 - Mar 2015 - 1 Play:  This one is hard to rate highly, due to the length of time required to play.  Figuring out which demands to fulfill and how to build your track is fun, but the times when your turn consists of just moving your train along your track to it's next destination isn't too much fun.  I should probably rate this between a 5.0 and 5.5, but nostalgia buoys the rating a bit.

Boy did we play a lot of this in our early gaming evolution! Although there's only a couple of dozen plays recorded, we played with 5 or 6 players and so we had to play each game over a number of sessions. So the gaming hours it ate is huge. I hanker after playing again - but this time with only 3 players to see how that works out. 

In many ways it has many elements of Ticket to Ride (congested access to routes, route building) but there's also the pick up and deliver "engine building" aspect. Do you go for long and profitable routes or short less profitable ones that you can repeat? Do you have a fast train or a slow but high capacity one? Loads of stuff to explore, all spinning off your decision about how to respond to your first hand of delivery cards. A very good game.

I'd like to play other crayon games.  This one is just too long for the level of complexity, and likewise it doesn't seem deep enough to warrant getting particularly fast at the game.  When an 18xx can be played in the same amount of time there's really no reason to spend an evening pushing trains a few miles a turn.

The time-lapse of the routes spreading across the map is fun to watch.

Interesting and engrossing network building/route planning game that should appeal to all railroad game afficianados. Games can be lengthy, so I recommend using the "speed" rules available in the rulebook and on the web. And yes, there are crayons.

I might even like this better than Iron Dragon. It's tighter. Finding a profitable plan for your initial three demand cards is tough. Also, while the foremen in Iron Dragon add some nice variety, they make everywhere essentially cheap to get to, once you get the right foreman (and you can, for at most 5GP). Only Nordkassel is really out of the way, and it's not essential to go there. In Empire Builder, the west coast is always the challenge. It's a mountainous route, but you have to get to one of the major cities there to win.

I like it better with the Mexico extension of the map. Mexico has a different character from most of the rest of the board. It's mountainous, but with fairly dense groupings of cities with some good payouts.

Maybe it's my affection for geography or the freedom to do so much, or maybe even the crayons help, but I really enjoy playing this. Because the games tend to be rather long (about 3 hours) and perhaps because it's a train game, I don't get to play it as often as I would like.

My first and still favorite crayon-RR game. Usually play with two, sometimes three players, and always with the quick start variant. We've played this game so many times through the years (since the early 80s) that there are actual grooves in our board for the most common and effective routes. Also have and enjoy [i]Eurorails[/i] (8) and [i]Nippon Rails[/i] (7).

Empire Builder, a train game before there were "train games". Before 1830 was, Empire Builder am. Before Age Of Steam was, Empire Builder am. Before Winsome was, Empire Builder am. Almost certainly one of the inspirations for Merchant of Venus. Almost certainly one of the inspirations for Roads & Boats. Being behind those two makes it, in my book, a truly pivotal modern game design.

It looks like those old natural resource maps they used to show you in geography class in school with all the cute little pictures in each state to show what "resources" were produced there. Now imagine you took that map and some crayons and some graph paper [all of which are conveniently in your school desk], overlaid the graph paper, and kickstarted your imagination.

This game is too finely grained, takes forever to play, has inane amounts of randomness, has almost no long-term strategy... and is a blast from start to finish. If you think you like Pick-up and Deliver games, you'll positively salivate over this one. "Let's see... get the Bauxite from Memphis, take it to New Orleans, get the Rice, take that to Tampa and get the Fruit... wait, what the hell is Bauxite?"

This is a crayon rail game where you build your railroad empire by drawing rail lines onto a map of North America with a crayon. That's super-neat, but sadly, I don't have the "chip" needed to play this game. I can't keep it straight where all the cities are (I have no problem with the Canadian ones, though), or where you can get the various goods. Perhaps I would prefer the previous edition, which apparently has fewer cities and fewer types of goods.

The route building is set up well, you need to plan where you want to go ahead of time. Starting with small routes to keep you in money while you build your infrastructure is key. After a while, it does feel like you just need to be lucky enough to get tickets that are in line with where your route is. Maybe there are better networks to build, but it is very dependent on your ticket draws. The events can really hinder your progress and push you back if you are unlucky.

After another play, I think this can leave my collection. It's a fairly long, slow paced game. Add the luck factor with the tickets and events, and the luck plays a little more than its fair share. Bottom line is there are better pick up and deliver games out there. Auf Asche and Merchant of Venus come to mind.

RATING: 7
The original. Its effectively a multi-player solitaire, trying to get your head around which of your contracts you can deliver most efficiently and then moving your train and building your track to do it. The only interaction is when other people's lines interfere with your own plans (usually unwittingly) or when you pay $4m for the pleasure of travelling down another player's track to get where you must go.

The trick is to manage your money tightly otherwise there's trouble - 'cause there's no loans, buddy. I liked the planning aspect.

The downside of the game is the downtime. It can take a while for a player to complete his turn if he's just delivered a contract and needs to review the new contract to see how that changes his plans. So play semi-simultaneously or restrict yourself to 2 players.

"The original crayon game. The map seems pretty challenging, with wide-open spaces but quite a few mountains and rivers. There is nothing that really sets this title apart from the rest in the series, but it is growing on me. I won't play any of the full CR games with more than 2p, because they take 60 minutes per experienced player."

What I like:
- Familiar geography makes it really easy to find cities
- Latest edition has nicely colored cards and goods chits

What I don't like:
- I wish the dots were farther apart
- The goods chits are single-sided
- The cards are nowhere near as functional as Empire Express
- The box is stupidly 2" thicker than necessary, which makes the contents spill around if you tip it (and takes up unnecessary space on the shelf. Fortunately, I found a piece of foam that is the *perfect* size to fill that space. 

Best with 2p, or solo (just track your turns on the board itself, and try to win in as few turns as possible). At 60 minutes per experienced player, and 90 minutes per inexperienced player, it's just too long with more players. 

My love of crayon rails seems to have faded a bit, but they are still my favorite solo game.

I really like the crayon rail system, games are relaxing and enjoyable, and I don't mind the long play length.  Pick-up-and-deliver is one of my favorite game mechanics, and this is probably one of the purest forms of it.

I do have mixed feelings on this particular map, though.  On one hand, it is nice to have geography that is familiar to an American audience.  On the other hand, I didn't find the geography to be particularly interesting, the payouts in the game seem low, and the events in this game just seem really harsh.

Yuck. Terrible components and extremely booring by today's standards. I'm not even talking about the crayons, which I am willing to overlook. It's impossible to read icons on the goods! And who in their right mind would flip through rulebook reading through a massive list of goods and locations and try to figure out where things go? This may have been "fun" in the Tactics II era (i.e. pre-color-TV), but... Gimme a break. The only people that might possibly buy this one are folks that have the locations and routes totally memorized (you know who you are), and have a hankering for some major nostalgia. No modern gamer would could possibly spend time playing this. Avoid - Railroad Tycoon would make a much better investment.

Comment: Rather enjoyable game. It's light, strategic and has you drawing with crayons. What more could you ask for? Rules are very easy to pick up on and it's got some very tough decision making. Events give the game an extra "oomph" to it. Components are nice but nothing special. I'd also rather not have a puzzle piece style map since drawing on the edges can be a bit of a pain. Overall, it's just an enjoyable game.

RATING: 9
The quintessential train game.  The most straightforward simulation of real railroading I've played.  It's actually a fairly simple game, just a step up in complexity from Ticket to Ride, but feels like a much more realistic game.  I haven't played any of the 18xx games yet, but I'm guessing most of their added complexity comes in the investment portion--the railroad simulation probably isn't much deeper than this.  

I recommend the public-locking variant, it makes the game more competitive, mitigates the randomness of the demand card draws, and in my opinion adds realism.  We also start with $60 million and 3 build rounds, and use 12/16 trains.

The main problem with this game is downtime, especially with 4 or more players.  Everyone should do as much advance planning as possible, but even so route building can be tedious, and every time a new card comes up it requires some consideration.  So far I haven't found any variants that really address this, and haven't come up with anything myself.  Still a great game though, so worth spending some effort to continue tweaking.

Despite low production value (other than tray insert which is pretty decent), a very good game.  Play it mostly as a 2 player game.  Takes about 3 hours.

Iron Dragon in the real world.  Basically the same game without the magic: lots of choices to make, but little player interaction as they race to accumulate the winning amount of money. I felt the choices available were a bit too limiting and the victory condition a bit too arbitrary, but I enjoyed the game as I played it.  Loses a small amount in the ratings vs. Iron Dragon because it doesn't have a red dragon.

I like this one, but be warned it does play in about four hours with four players that have some experience (with speed boosting options.  With two players I have no doubt that a game can be played in well under 2 hours without using official variations that speed up play.

This has good strategic play depth and replay ability.

No official solo play, but in a few ways I like this one more than Silverton; however Silverton also has some things that I like over this one also.  The unofficial solo play is good, but not the same game.  It does have a similar feel but is more complex than the standard game and isn't for those that do not know how to play the standard game.

Instead of crayons we use fine tipped dry erase markers and plastic from a poster-frame to cover the board.  Works wonders and is much easier to see and apply track.

At first glance, Empire Builder seems pretty straight forward.  Get your demands and fill them - however, there really is some thought that needs to be put into how you construct your rail line, and making sure that you aren't inefficient with your choices.  Interesting game and one I'm sure I'll be playing again soon.  I have heard that each player that you add to the game adds another 60 minutes to the game, if that is the case, I'll never play this with more than 2 or 3, tops.  A three hour game would drive my rating down tremendously.

(When rating games I focus on the "how likely I am to play this game again" part of the BGG description rating, as opposed to the "quality" part of the rating.)

I bet this game is a lot of fun, but I was in rare form when I played this one.  I might as well have just started eating the crayons.  Probably the dumbest string of decisions I've made in my life.  It's very easy to run out of money and get stuck with no options in the middle of a delivery if you're not paying attention.  I'd like to play it again some day with my head in the open air.

Way too long for what it is. Very much multiplayer solitaire - just occasionally there is competition for some track spots, but usually you cannot afford to beat someone to a track spot if it is not going to immediately help you complete a delivery.  The events just seem so random in an otherwise very mathy game - it's not like you can really strategize to avoid them, apart form avoiding laying river track, so it's just random who they hit.  Only being able to move 12 spaces turns the game into a long slog to 250 once everyone has most of the the track they need.  You should play Merchant of Venus over this any day.

Two Player Value = Good, but more competitive with more players.

Empire Builder is the first of the crayon-rail games that set a new standard of "train" games and gives players that great "train" game feeling.

Empire Builder uses the tried and true crayon rail building system.  Players use crayons to draw tracks on the board.  Players then use their rails to make deliveries.

Empire Builder uses cards to power a simple pick-up and delivery system.  Players pick-up good from one city then deliver those goods to another city to earn money.  The first to set amount of money wins.

The crayon rail pick-up and delivery system is easy to learn.  New players will quickly learn the game and start drawing their own rails.

Why not longer inventive, the crayon rail system was new for its time.  It is fun to draw on the board.  Sort of like a big kids coloring book.

The artwork is minimal at best, but the components are fine.  Same goes for the theme.  Empire Builder is more focused on mechanics then art and components.

Empire Builder is great teaching game.  This is a wonderful way to learn the geography of the nation.

I was VERY reluctant to play this when Ben bought it, but it is currently one of my favorites. I want to play it ALL THE TIME. We play the "Honeymoon Rules" when it's just the 2 of us, and find that they work well and that our games are always very close.

Only played this once.  Didn't like it much, but I'm not really into the whole railway thing (or the whole "boards that you draw on with crayon" thing).  The only real contribution it's made to my gaming group is that commandeered its currency to replace that flimsy shit Powergrid comes with.

We played this with some friends, our first crayon game, with the four of us it took 5 hours to finish!  I thought the trains could be faster and wished for more upgrades to buy but overall I liked it. Days later, to my surprise, my wife starts asking questions about the game, turns out she liked it!  As a result, its on its way in the mail, rarely does my wife ask about a game days after playing!

 With the game in our collection now, we are currently trying out many of the optional rules.  Even in the 2 player games, the hours seem to just melt away.  We save this one for killing long periods of time but not the entire day.

Train game where you use crayon to draw track on a map. In practice, this is easier said than done, as the crayons are prone to break and require multiple passes before you can tell the lines apart. And if you forget to wipe down the board when you finish the game, fuhgeddaboudit!

Straight-forward game of build track which costs money, use track to deliver goods to make money, build more track, etc. Decent game, but not fabulous.

The game is long, deep, and very easy to make a critical mistake in.

First played this in 2002 and was immediately hooked.  I love the whole route-building and delivery system.  I wish it could be shorter with more than 3 players, but since I rarely play with more than 2 (at 2 hours) that is not really a problem.  My wife likes the fact that I cannot interfere very much with what she is doing.  At any rate, this is my favorite of the series.  She prefers Australian.  As for the luck of the draw element--it's kind of like Acquire to me, I don't get it, but the same couple of people always seem to win.  I think it is the same with Empire Builder, the good players always seem to get good cards just like the good Acquire players always seem to have the tiles they need. At any rate, this is one that I'll be playing for a long time :)

This one takes a while, so don't take it off the shelf if you don't have four hours.

You know, Empire Builder presents a clean system. It isn't un-fun. It just takes too LONG to play. If the playtime were reduced, I could see pulling this out again. I realize that the time it takes to play a game is one of those factors where people vary widely with respect to what they accept/tolerate and what they like. For me, Empire Builder is too long. Although the box says ages twelve and up, my eight year old played this competitively with us.

I've only played it once with the newer map that includes Mexico.  This is my first experience with a crayon-based train game.  I liked it, but the game seems to be a bit long for what it is.  Perhaps a lower dollar amount to win the game might be good idea at least for the first game.  The game also seems to be a bit unforgiving in the beginning stage, although the expert said that all the players simply drew bad cards.

Simple, placid pick up and deliver game that gives you a sense of accomplishment as you build up your infrastructure and race around the map.  

Nothing overly complex, but it doesn't need to be.  

It can outstay its welcome, out of the box, so I highly recommend playing official variant of the trains as 12s and 16s rather than 9s and 12s.  It will accelerate the game to about the right pace, with little detriment.  

This is a fun system.

Now if only the crayons weren't such a pain in the ass...

RATING: N/A
Played a single game with three players. I didn't dislike the game completely. I like the crayon system because it feels different from everything I'm used to and that, sometimes, it's a bless. 

I found the game boring because most of the time players have to wait several turns before completing anything important. The fact that trains travel 12 spaces, at the most, makes the game too slow and too dull. Specially for a game that doesn't seem to have any interaction at all apart from a minor usage of other's players tracks (something I've only seen once and it wasn't a brilliant move I must say).

It also has lots of random elements specially destinations and goods cards. If a player has more luck he can go ahead a make a few millions easily than others. That doesn't mean he's going to win the game of course but it sure means that the game can become a lot more fun to him than to others.

Classic Crayon Rail game.  This along is the definitive 'pick up and deliever' game.  

it is fun trying to maximize your route while trying to collect cash for deliveries.  The 'luck' factor can play hugely in what demand cards you get; but for the most part, the player with the most efficient track can make the fastest most lucrative deliveries.  

Is a little long for what it is; but it is an enjoyable train game.

I'm a fan of train games, and this one is my favorite.  The freedom of being able to lay track on a fine grid really appeals to me, as does the constant stress of building long-term vs. short-term infrastructure.  The game can feel long, so I'd keep the number of players low (4 or less), plan your turn during other players' turns, and use the speedy train option.  This is my family's favorite game.

I'm still learning the strategy for Empire Builder, which I play as a two-player game. So far, I think its appearance and reputation belie a more nuanced opportunity for planning and serious decision making. I wouldn't say it's the deepest of pick-up-and-deliver games, but it's certainly a quality one -- and worth the time to learn. My biggest concern is the random event cards, which add flavor, but also a heavy dose of luck that can cripple a player through no fault of his own. That said, if they really bother me that much in the long run, I can always remove them from the deck: easy fix.

Fun game that i've gotten to play. only two drawbacks, one is that you have to put up with the crayons and two is that the map, while being realistic, may not be the perfect design for this game, a fantasy map would solve several tiny hang ups. Still a game that I've seriously enjoyed.

The original American crayon rail game is required reading for the genre, but you must be prepared for a 30 year-old, highly intellectual design.  Empire Builder is a 4-hour, brain-burning slog.  Yet the 5th edition adds plenty of color and matches the production values of the slick Martian Rails.  Empire Builder has the added benefit that it will teach U.S. geography to undereducated children.

EB's crayon rails is a clever system, although I can see there being big swings of luck in the card draws. If you can get a couple of synergistic deliveries, especially early in the game when money is really tight, it is a huge boost. 
If you can get over that aspect, though, it is a good, but ultimately not great game. My main issue is game length.  I'm not one to shy away from long games if the reward is there, but EB seems to have a lot of good tension at the beginning (when money is tight and you need to get your system going) and at the end (the race for $250), but drag a bit in the middle when you're building out your network and running a bunch of medium sized loads.
Although I haven't played with the full complement of players, I can see why it isn't recommended with 5 or 6.

I'm torn between the original and the updated version that includes Mexico.  On the one hand, I like starting in Mexico City, on the other, I think the original board plays a little tighter with the smaller play area.

was quite fun when we played.  we had to start over because all of us ran out of money and couldn't expand to fit our demands.  the second game went much better and we absolutely love it :)

RATING: 4
Too long of a game.Took 5 1/2 hours for a 4 player game, but 2 had never played before.  Played a 2nd time and the 4 player game "only" took 4 hours.  Just way too long of a game for what it is.  Game gets repetitive near the end once you have all your track built and you are just trying to get to $250million.  Got another play and still has the same problem of being too long and too repetitive.

Crayon rails!! I've played IRON DRAGON, now can't wait to play this one.  The newest edition!! Also got the pewter miniatures! Also am looking forward to trying the newer Martian Rails! (Played Martian Rails, and it's GREAT!! Still need to play Empire Builder and a dozen other crayon rails games.) Finally played, disappointed in the results. I ran out of money and couldn't connect up and had to sit there, finally gave up when there was no recourse. That's really too much essential calculation required. It shouldn't be that easy to be driven off the course.

RATING: 3
The first of a series of tedious draw rails with a crayon, pick up and deliver games, all of which are marred by frustrating event cards that are too strong and, ultimately, determine who wins.  Bleah.

I know people who love them, but the whole series just falls completely flat for me.

Great game!  I wish I had more time to play it.  A little long for casual play after work.

RATING: 6
Essentially a logistics puzzle. Venerated, yet clearly vulnerable to the accusation, "racing solitaire".  The only time I really notice my opponents is when I try to build track in an area already occupied.  Plenty of times my turn consists of nothing more than moving a fraction of the total distance toward my desired destination.

Overwhelming to new players if you don't use a higher starting cash balance.

*Update* I have renewed enthusiasm playing the computer version (EBPlayer) against the AI profiles.  Game time approx 1 hour removes the drudgery.  I have eagerly purchased the shareware.

Crayon rail games look great, but I feel that you spend too much time adding and doing calculations, and not enough time developing strategies.  It seems to me that the rules just get in the way of having a lot of fun.

Pretty solid if not very innovative game. I like that it's easy to explain to non-gamers and it's very intuitive. If you play this too much, you will likely get tired of it but it has plenty of load cars so there is no proven strategy that will always work as you are the mercy of the cards.

RATING: 9.5
Really good, I wish it were a little shorter/tighter.
I never play with the event cards.  I have the trains able to do 12-16-20-24 dots.
After every game I spend the next few days thinking about how I could tweak the rules.

RATING: 7
Satisfying gameplay when it comes down to it, but suffers major problems of component quality and excessive downtime.  This baby is showing its age in a bad way.  Still, drawing on the board with crayons (or dry erase markers) is cool, even if it is in a game whose style doesn't lend it to frivolity.  The game gets better with familiarity, but it'll take dedication to do so, as it tends to run long.  Despite all these things, I enjoy playing the game, which I suppose says something about the strength of the mechanics.

I really enjoy Empire Builder, but I've played it two or three times and still have not yet finished a game of it.  Not through any fault of its own.  No, every single, blasted time we've sat down to play this, I fall in love with it and start to build my vast rail empire, and then... and then everything comes to a crashing halt as something or other always seems to interrupt.  Someone has to leave in the middle of the game, or someone who wasn't going to show up at all suddenly walks in the door and we end up starting a different game, etc.

I'm starting to get a little disheartened.

Rating after 1 play. It appears that I like train games and this one more so than others. I really like simulating train movement and drawing on the board. It is fun but lacks interaction. Played with the quickstart/quickfinish? rules and it helped. I think if it was longer than it was (with the quickstart rules) it would drag on a little past its welcome.

You have to decide up front if you want a 1-2 hour game, or 3-6 hours.  Use the fast train and fast start rules for the former, and normal rules for the latter.  We've found that building a "government" rail through about 6 spaces of mountains near each coast, and about 10 spaces straight into Mexico that anyone can attach to really helps speed up game play.

Overall I really like having the specific goods to ship from one place to another.  The main thing I'd say I dislike about EB, is it seems to take longer than Railroad Tycoon and Age of Steam, which are alternative games that It'd probably play intstead.  Furthermore this game seems to have a bit less player interaction and more waiting for your turn.

We really enjoy the crayon railbuilder games, and we do not play agressively, although it can be done. We play the original Empire builder, with the map that does not include Mexico. Recently we purchase the 5th edition, but have not played it yet. 
We still own and play the original, and will not likely give up it's place on our gaming shelves.

More fun than Silverton, and MUCH more fun than being exposed to gamma radiation.

Fast rules only (increased train speeds: 9->12 and 12->16), without event cards.  Purchased as a family game.

[i]Update:[/i]

Purchased as a family game that would never be played, it turns out.

Game for sale or trade.  Help me help you.

A much better experience this time around with the crayon rail series of games than my first try with Russian Rails.  Not sure if it was due to my expectation or the people I was playing with or the slight variation in the maps.  Everything seemed right and fell in place for me.  The zen-like state of building tracks and delivering goods worked so well together to make this an enjoyable process.  I guess the "luck" aspect in the card draw is very much a determinant in how well you do here, more so than the other pick up and deliver and/or rail games.

RATING: 8
Multiplicity of options makes this a great game.  Early expansion is rewarded, but considering which trips to take is most often the key to victory.

The one drawback?  Time.  Games run into the 5-hour range, sometimes.  Sure, this can be helped somewhat with house-rules, but we usually let well enough alone, and give over an evening to Empire Builder.

This game is fun, but LONG.  I think i would be better if I spent a lot more time optimizing my routes, but I just don't.  I always play with the 'short' game rules (more startup capital, faster trains), and can't see myself ever playing without them.

Played MANY games prior to recording plays.

Adding colour to the goods tokens would shave an hour off of play time. I do enjoy drawing with crayons though.

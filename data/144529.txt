Excelente juego euro híbrido, con un tema muy bien implementado, buenas mecánicas, gran rejugabilidad por toda la variedad que aporta, poco factor suerte, sólo debido a la configuración del mazo inicial, y sobre todo muy muy táctico. Diseño excelente. A falta de probarlo más con muchas ganas con diferentes facciones. Variante con pandora sobre todo a 3 jugadores, y variante a 4 colaborativa - competitiva de equipos de 2 vs. 2.  
Probada una partida a 2 jugadores (aliens vs científicos). Y otra a 4 (Grises y aliens vs. Marines y científicos).

Pretty cool mancala-derivative.  Lots of interesting decisions to make, but playing with 4 was a little too chaotic.  It felt like there were a ton of rules and the card powers were all over the place: this was both the best and the worst part for me.  It probably was a little more complicated--and too long--for what it is, but it was enjoyable.

RATING: 7
+ Tons of cool cards that make each faction feel different than the rest; your units don't die, so even if you're behind, it doesn't feel nasty like some other games.
- The four player game that I played really was way too chaotic.  I primarily picked this up because I wanted a good 2 on 2 game, so who knows what the future holds for this one.


Why it's previously-owned:
The game was chaotic, didn't flow well, seemed way too random, and just had too many moving pieces as a four-player team game (which was the primary mode that it was purchased for).
This was traded for Firefly: Artful Dodger.

An excellent semi-abstract design. There are some gamey elements, but those are quickly forgiven due to the sheer cleverness of the underlying mechanisms. I don't think this would play well at higher numbers; it was clearly conceived as a two player head-to-head.

It's a mancala game with a space station theme. That's a strange marriage. It's totally not what I was expecting, but it's still pretty good. Way more theme than Trajan anyway ;)

RATING: 7
Sci-fi επιτραπέζιο με 5 factions που ανταγωνίζονται για την επιβίωση τους μέσα σε έναν διαστημικό σταθμό. Κάθε faction (επιστήμονες, marines, διάφοροι εξωγήινοι) έχει τις δικές του κάρτες και ικανότητες. Ο κεντρικός μηχανισμός του παιχνιδιού είναι ο γνωστός mancala και γενικά επικρατεί μια euro λογική με open information και καθόλου τύχη αν εξαιρέσεις τις τυχαίες κάρτες της τράπουλας σου. Ακριβώς επειδή όλα είναι υπολογίσιμα ίσως εμφανιστεί το φαινόμενο του Αnalysis Paralysis. Προσοχή λοιπόν με ποιόν παίζετε.

Το παιχνίδι είναι πολύ καλό με 2 άτομα ενώ γίνεται όλο και πιο χαοτικό όσο προσθέτεις άτομα. Δεν δοκίμασα όμως το 2vs2 με teams. Σε αυτό το κομμάτι θυμίζει το Innovation που επίσης το χάος ξεφεύγει στα 4 άτομα.

Aliens εναντίων Marines, κυνηγητό, πιστολίδι και παγίδες μέσα σε διαστημικό σταθμό. Τι άλλο να ζητήσει κανείς?? Εντάξει δεν είναι τέτοια η αίσθηση γιατί κακά τα ψέματα όταν αρχίζεις και υπολογίζεις κινήσεις το θέμα χάνεται κάπως.

Es rápido, fácil de explicar y divertido de jugar. Además tiene suficientes cosillas como para que no se haga repetitivo. Los entreturnos te mantienen atento a las acciones del rival por lo que no se hacen pesados. Tiene muy poco azar ya que las cartas son todas útiles y depende más de como las utilizas que de lo que te haya salido. Recomendado!

Have played 2 team games of this now (2 teams of 2) and both were great.  Now, with a solid grasp of the rules, I'm very keen to play it some more.

A bit of strategy-in-advance is required to excel, but at the same time, the card-based curveballs can throw said strategies out the window.

Both games have also finished in around 75 minutes, so would expect them to be more like an hour once people are familiar with the game.

This one also has a nice Alien-esque/Space Hulk theme, which works well.

This game excels as a two player game. You out try to desperately out think your opponent while your pieces slide through rooms in a mancala-like movement. Every faction feels different. Games can be tense right up to the finish.

Don't play with more than two. It's just too chaotic.

As a two player game this is great.  It's very tactical and doesn't feel like anything else on the market.  Each group of units plays differently and there is plenty of nasty tricks to discover.  The production is beautiful the game is ripe for expansions.

RATING: 9
Pros: Fast setup, fast game play, rules easy to explain, non gamers pick it up quick, excellent rule book (portal has put a lot of effort into this,and you can really tell). 

Cons: Too random, feels like playing monopoly. Not enough control of movement (location of other player's pawns affect your movement). I am not understanding how to develop long term strategy. Cards too thin. 90 percent of what I wanted it to be. My wife doesn't like it, which limits how much it makes it to the table :(

Because card stack is unknown and opponents can replace pending cards and it is very hard to control movement I felt like there is very little strategy in this game. I really want to like it, but I can't quite figure this one out yet. There is a lot of thinking with every move, but a lot of that thought is wasted, because I cant manifest it easily. 

Initial rating 6

*Update*
Played a game with regular gamers and loved it. Very chess like, starting to see more of the angles now. There is strategy, but it is very fluid and dynamic. Each turn took on average 5 minutes to complete, because of all the thought process. Highly recommend 4 players play in team mode instead of death match for many reasons. Death match has lots of downtime between turns. Players can't 
strategize between turns because board state is so fluid. I really like synergy in sharing faction powers between factions in team play (this is so frigging cool).

Theseus is a tactical game where it all depends on your movement.
With a lower player count it really gets tactical and you can plan ahead. But the more players you have the more randomness you get.

I enjoyed it quite a bit but I feel like I need a few more plays to discover the depths of the space station.


One more play into the depths of Theseus:
Yeah, no, not for me. I really liked the idea and what I've read before was really interesting. Too bad.

Tense, stategic game with asymmetric factions and great production values from the same designer as the all-time great Neuroshima Hex.

Man, I want to like this game more. The mancala aspect is great. The walls in the rooms and how they affect combat is great. My complaint with the game is twofold:

1) It's hard to teach. This is a really unique game and I don't have anything to compare it to. However, once you play a few turns, it clicks and it's not too hard to remember what the rules are.

2) The real probably is the extreme asymmetry. I like some asymmetry but not so much that each faction feels as if it's on rails. I still like to have different paths to victory. As it is, the choices in the game are primarily tactical, even when you're installing cards. Not very surprising, I guess, considering that the designer did the tactics game Neuroshima Hex. I would just have liked to see these mechanics in a less extreme asymmetrical game.

Rating a 7 for now, but could become an 8 with more plays. A thinking man's mancala. The addition of the cards makes some locations more desirable than others. Like an onion, this game reveals more layers of complexity with each game.

Tentative rating after one play as the red faction, which I won, in a 4p game. Not sure what to make of it. The mechanics felt weird and the whole thing felt too chaotic overall.

I strongly sense the game was designed for 2 or 3 players, as the blue and gray factions weren't even close in our 4p game, and it's not like I was doing anything especially clever to win.

Anyway, I'll have to try this again with fewer players and see how it works out.

A game where a board where you have 3 pieces and 5 spaces in which you can only move one way that can give you an aneurysm!

This game is an ingenious two-player abstract which requires a lot of planning and countering but the good think is there are no hidden variables and very little luck, with the exception of the draw piles in which you can always see the top card; very puzzly.

My only qualm and this could have been due to translation is the rules at times seemed a little unintuitive and could have been stream-lined better but you will figure it all out within a single game.  Duplication is a heinous card that has so many interactions and exceptions but otherwise I love this game.  Simple, clever and very challenging!

I love, love, love:
- the asymmetric factions and their attack vs data acquisition capabilities and installation cards fitting of their play style
- the artwork and theme
- the walls and how they affect interaction between players' pieces
- the installation cards and how their placement affects gameplay
- that pieces can be jettisoned out of play temporarily
- the lesser onslaughts triggered by a sector being totally full and onslaughts triggered by landing a piece on the Corridors
- the mancala-style movement of pieces
- that life points are lost on a tracker rather than by pieces being lost from the game
- that the game can be won by earning 20 data points instead of inflicting 20 wounds to a player
- that the game can end not only by earning 20 points or someone losing all of their life points
- that it rewards multiple plays for mastering the game and its factions
- that it's an abstract game but still with plenty of theme to keep it interesting

I dislike:
- that it sometimes feels like it goes on for too long, maybe?
- that it's supposedly a game for up to 4 players--no way; this really shines as a two-player game, adding more players just adds chaos and you're not playing as much strategically anymore

Final verdict: Really love this game. Great abstract with theme and lots of choices that have lots of consequences. Can be AP-prone, but if you stick to playing it just as a two-player game, you get a lot of enjoyment and appreciation for what's going on with minimal downtime between moves. Definitely staying in the collection.

Gosh this one plays fast! Each of the factions plays very differently. The scientists and the greys can collect data as well as damage points where as the aliens and marines are solely military. It is a race to 20 points. Movement is restrictive but this is a major part of the strategy of the game as you can place your pieces to force your opponents to move pieces through traps and other hazards to case them damage. 

I really really enjoyed this one and I am looking forward to playing this again soon and exploring a bit more what each faction can do.

Nem vagyok az absztrakt játékok nagy híve, így különösen nagy elismerés tőlem, hogy ezt nagyon korrekt darabnak gondolom. Egyszerű (ám sajnos megintcsak elég rosszul leírt) szabályok, pörgős játékmenet, sok-sok agyalás. Igazából végtelen lépésre lehetne előre gondolkodni, pont mint a sakkban és ez azért frusztrál engem valamiért. De bármikor szívesen leülök mellé újra. 
Vigyázat, nekem egész mást sugallt a játék címe, témája kinézete, mint amilyen. Nem valami tematikus sci-fi-háború ez, hanem egy aránylag egyszerű szabályrendszerű absztrakt darab.

RATING: 6
In spite of all the theme sauce, Theseus is a rather abstract game. It can feel rather limiting at times, but it is these restrictions that turn an entirely chaotic game into something manageable (at least with two players). The card play injects a little bit of strategic planning but gameplay is primarily tactical, and the batch of cards available to you can make or break your game easily. Theseus is a quick affair, though, so that doesn't weigh too heavily for me. The asymmetric player powers make the factions play very differently in any case.
Outlook positive so far, but I guess it could still go either way. Looking forward to the teamplay variant.

Mechanisches, tendenziell seelenloses Mancala. Ich empfand das Spiel als wenig dynamisch. Im Grunde entscheidet sich RAUMSTATION THESEUS beim Setzen der Karten in die Sektoren, that's it. Der Rest ist dann nur noch ein taktisches, zwanghaftes Abwägen, in welchen Sektor man zieht oder besser nicht zieht. Der actionkonzentrierte Ameritrash verschleiert den eindimensionalen Anspruch ans eigene Tun. Schade um das coole Thema.

Theseus is a fun, confrontational, quick playing game.  The mancala setup gives you a focused decision space that is nevertheless rich in long term thinking (with 2 players, at least).  Theseus is all about disempowering your opponent, rather than empowering yourself, which is a brave choice.  Review here:

Great Two player game. I have not played it with any more than two. Evey move has to be thought out and effects the other players move since mancala is the movement. Great theme. Not to long. Solid two player.

Played 3 games in a row at first sitting.  I love the puzzle, but I suck at it.  Lost with the aliens against the marines twice.  Then we switched sides and I lost to the aliens, but it was a close thing.

Seems like there's a bit of luck of the draw affecting each game.  He just got fire in place and upgraded early on.  Then when I played as marines and finally got fire in place and upgraded, he threw creepers on it and disabled all the cards I piled up in that sector.  Basically negated all of my work that game and I was left to my pistols.  

I like the puzzle.  I like the pace, turns are quick.  I like the length of the game.  Even though I got my @ss handed to me 3 times in a row, the game didn't outstay its welcome.  I won't play with more than 2p.  

UPDATE: sold it.  Wife never wanted to play it.

Confusing and unnatural gameplay at first, blossoms into a neat game pretty fast. I liked Neuroshima Hex okay but (a) I was so bad at it that I never understood what was going on, and (b) 20 HP for your headquarters seemed gratuitous when it felt heroic to do 10 damage in a game. Theseus has fewer "oops, too bad" moments (unlike when your placements in NH are undercut by enemy pieces with higher priority) and games ending by timeout seem much rarer.

That said, I just love asymmetrical games and so am tempted to tell you to ignore my opinion. But by that logic I should have loved Neuroshima Hex and I don't; I think that's why this is so appealing.

Got to give it to Michael oracz. I am not a fan of abstract games but he always able to take his abstract design and mixed them with a great theme that works so well you forget you are playing an abstract game. This and Neuroshima hex are some of my favorites games. 

For Theseus, it's another slam duck from oracz and I cannot wait to see more from him.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: molt abstracte,  mecànica de mancala. No m'acaba de motivar com funciona el joc, a més, necesita coneixer bé que fa cada facció per poder disfrutar-ho. Molt caòtic a més de 2 jugadors.

Got completely screwed over playing it with the "beginners" method of putting 3 cards down the first time instead of 1 so wouldn't recommend that. Unfortunately the marine had a fortunate first draw and got some damage dealing cards out that were hard to avoid so early in the game. However I did enjoy the mechanisms so will give this one a few more goes before making a final decision.

A couple of things to make the theme better is to label the rooms.  When we play, we just call it yellow, orange, or red rooms.  We can never remember the names of the rooms so printing the names on the room tiles are better.  Also I noticed that randomizing the rooms makes each game you play a bit more unique.  Overall a nice game for 2p.

Another 30 minute 2 player meaty Portal game? 

Edit - Nice theme, though I'm not sure it comes through strongly here, it seems to me it doesn't. Definitely looks highly chaotic with more than 2 players. Looks mostly tactical vs strategic, but this is only my first impression and could be missing something. 

I think the biggest thing I noticed here is the decisions don't seem all that compelling for some reason, and I can't quite place my finger on it, but its enough to cause my a big enough pause to not buy it. (and it might be due to them all being tactical, just reacting to the game state vs planning to shape it) Also, seems to me there just isn't much to explore here, again likely due to the mostly tactical nature and the way decisions are presented.

2017-11-17 - I have hopes that my opinion of this game will go up with more plays, but playing with the basic cards and the Aliens and Marine factions was not quite as interesting as I hoped. Still, the mancala mechanism is celeverly applied here, and the game is surprisingly thematic.

RATING: 7.5
Dead simple gameplay, although the install mechanic seems to trip new players up at first. Not entirely convinced that the multiplayer is worthwhile, but the two player game builds nicely as each opponent begins building their traps and enhancements. And then all hell breaks loose as you try and set everything off to propel yourself to victory. Great theme well represented by the variety of factions, which also provide some nice variability between games.

Theseus sounds like the dumbest idea ever, but when you start playing together, all of the weird mechanics fit seamlessly into an extremely thematic and strategic experience.  So much more than the sum of its parts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After Mancala - the family game (Finca), Mancala - the heavy Euro game (Trajan) now there is Mancala - the thematic game. Additionally, there's some combo building to be done to set up power combinations with your development cards to score either hits or knowledge, depending on the respective role. With the full complement of four players there's considerable chaos but superior gameplay can still pay out. I don't share the majority opinion that it's only worth playing with two but at the same time I only consider it an ok game until I had the chance to play it with two. For an odd abstract combat game, I prefer Tash-Kalar for now.

Good game I suppose but I need more plays to better judge (only one so far).  Aliens vs. scientists which at first looked like the aliens were going to easily and quickly destroy the scientists, then the scientists gained ground and it looked like they would flash back and easily wipe out the aliens.  But in the end the aliens pulled it off and snuffed out the scientists.  I'm not sure yet this will be a great game or just a so-so game.

Klimat Obcego. Zastawianie pułapek i poruszanie się tak by w nie nie wpaść. Każda frakcja ma swoje indywidualne zdolności i karty pułapek specyficznych tylko dla tej frakcji. Bardzo ciekawa gra, mechanika poruszania na planszy (manakala) ludkami (krążkami) o tyle pól ile ludków jest w miejscu z którego zaczynamy ruch. Co powoduje potrzebę przeliczania tego co będzie w następnych ruchach. Gdzie mnie wywali gdy przeciwnik stanie tu albo tu, a jak ja stanę tu to... No wymaga kombinowania, a zasadzki (karty) kładzione przy pomieszczeniach umożliwiają tworzenie kombosów. Taka Neuroshima Hex wywrócona na lewą stronę ;). Świetna tylko z kim w to grać? Gra nie będzie dodrukowywana, przynajmniej w tej formie. Możliwe że najbardziej niedoceniona gra MO, a może nawet najlepsza z jego dotychczas wydanych gier.

I rarely ever buy games without trying them these days. Being a grizzled game buyer for the past 15 years teaches you to try things before buying them otherwise you end up with a shelf full of games you dislike that you bought because they looked pretty. But there are those rare occasions that I do buy a game without having played it, but only after watching videos and reading reviews from those who's opinions I trust. Theseus is one of the latter games. I took a chance on it, and boy did it payoff. Theseus is a tactical, asymmetrical,  strategic battle of wits between two players. The game plays in the perfect amount of time, the rules are a little beefy, but this games the game a nice heft when playing. The card interaction is brilliant and overall the design is fantastic. I am really looking forward to exploring the design space this game has carved out for itself, and seeing where Portal can take the design with new content in the form of faction expansions. To me this is one of the most underrated gems that has been published in the past few years.

I've been interested in this ever since I first heard about it, as I really like Michał Oracz's and Portal Games' Neuroshima Hex. It sounded pretty cool, and looked neat. I was worried about the gaminess of the mancala element, so I'm pleased to find out that it's really not a mancala element at all. This is a tight, puzzly, brutal game with a fair amount of tactics and randomness; a worthy successor to Neuroshima Hex. I played with just two, having heeded the warning to start there and move to more players later. I think that, also like NH, moving to even three players will provide enough instability to keep everyone from being able to really settle in, which I like. Looking forward to more plays of this.

First impression after one 2p game.  The game is an aggressive duel type game with asymmetric player powers.  I like the mancala type mechanic, and the simplicity of the basic rules and mechanics.  However, this is partly offset by the many cards with special powers/exceptions/rule breaks.  This is a duel game that requires some commitment of learning how the various the cards and factions break the rules to play competitively.  Will reassess rating after repeated plays.

Rating based on 4P deathmatch:  Semi-random chaos, no ability to plan for longterm, few real choices, no ability to manage card deck.  Marines rule, Bots & Aliens seem OK, Grays & Scientists weak.

As others have stated, 2P or team play might be the only way to enjoy this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Apart from the well realized theme, the one feature that makes Theseus stand out is the idea of a dynamic playing field, where progressing play will turn the rooms of Theseus station into deathtraps or sanctuaries for each faction. The Mancala movement gives you rather limited options on where you go, which can make the game seem to veer more towards the purely tactical.

The complete freedom of where you install your stuff does, however, offer a lot of strategic options, and I think that this is where the real decision space is hidden. Focusing on unit movement can feel frustrating, more like helplessly careening through a mad pinball machine, but the glorious idea of Theseus is to construct this machine during the game together, and with conflicting goals.

With two players, the game is a rather intense puzzle, since it is possible (and worthwhile) to plan two or three turns ahead. With more players, you are better advised to rely on fuzzy logic and a more holistic view on the board situation, since the things that can and will happen before your next turn will splice up the decision tree quite a bit. And the other players will often refuse to perform the move you planned for them, because it was so very obviously the best move to take ...

All in all, this is one of the very few games on my wishlist, due to both its original concept and the excellent development. One example of this is the gradual introduction of the more funky action cards, another is the subtle differentiation between the rooms of the station.

This game has enough unique mechanics and elements to make it interesting strategically, the theme is very well done, and the gameplay is smooth. It is a blast to play.

An underrated gem. Every factions feel different and thematic, and the gameplay is simple with few components to track. My only nitpick is that you can sometime get stuck in a multiple-turns loop of speeding around the roundel and removing cards with little to no action going on. 'Tit for tat' is the best way to describe what I'm saying.

It is great for 2 players, best with 3.

Tried with and without the advanced cards and recommend using the advanced cards to strengthen the teams for a much better experience.

RATING: 7
Still deciding if it's brilliant or bullshit. It feels like it's somewhere in the middle: Don't love the super-randomness of move and what feels like my complete inability to plan, but I loooove the asymmetry of the sides, how the match-ups interact, and how a killer combo can blow the game wide open.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The problem with Finca/Mancala variant type movement is that what you can move next turn is very much in the control of your opponents. When movement is the heart and soul of the game, as it is here, that loss of control is an issue. Where you move dictates what action you can do (upgrade, beat up other players, etc), whether you can land on a full location and beat up other players for points, and whether you can get out your own action cards onto a location for later use. Which essentially is the game. So there was a sense of lessed-ness, hoping you're presented with a good move, making the best of what's left you. Sure you can plan moves ahead and try and manufacture options for opponents that will lead to something good on your next turn. But it just takes one stray move and the scene changes. There just wasn't enough over and beyond the flawed move mechanic for me to want to play this again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Neat game unlike anything I can think of. It accomplishes what it sets out to do:
- variant of Mancala mechanism for movement.
- asymmetrical factions.
- replayability.
- tight feeling of being on a space station.
- 2 to 4 player game

Though the game is greater than the sum of it's parts, my wife and I decided that it wasn't for us.

I ordered because of watching a positive Radho playthrough, and it still didn't work for me. I should have clued in during the video, at the 40 minute point, when there was still no damage to either team. 

Games take too long, even as two player. Very few decisions, sometimes no decisions if you land in a boring spot, which happens a lot. Game went over an hour and it seems to take forever to dish out the first few hit points. Forget about getting someone down to zero from 20, as the game will end because you can't put any more cards out. (Two plays and it happened twice) Factions seem a bit unbalanced. Scientists are weak. 

 I remove your installation, you remove mine. Back and forth, constant pending cards getting removed. Boring! Nothing exciting ever happened. AP is not possible because you have so few decisions to make. your card deck makes the game too random and it is too fiddly for what it's worth in gameplay.

Mancala gimmick just does not work. With three pieces you have little control over where you can go. The Trajan Mancala is far more interesting and I can finish a (much more involving) game of trajan in less than an hour.

RATING: 7
Theseus is a fast-playing game where you move your pieces around the board (literally--and clockwise only!) trying to fight your opponents' pieces on the board.  The main difference between this and other combat-based games, though, is that doing damage doesn't hurt your opponents at all, but instead just gives you points (which the Eurogamer in me appreciates, of course).  Each player starts with a race having a unique deck of cards to work with, and its own individual way of earning points.  Of course, since everyone runs around the board unpredictably from turn to turn, and your performance is based on landing where other people or cards are, you can't really plan ahead in the game.  I found this to be decent as a lightweight game.

Brain burny and although the game is rather simple, there are just enough rules that you'll need to reference the rulebook for your first couple plays. I really enjoyed how different the races were and I can't wait to try out each faction and learn the subtitles of each. This game would be perfect for expansions.

A pretty abstract game -- the theme isn't really too present during game play -- it doesn't really feel like you're competing for control of the space station here. Plays ok with 2 or 3 (haven't tried it with 4). The artwork is quite nice. The different factions are kinda neat

Abstract game with a fair bit of take that to your planning. While you are having to plan ahead you have to react directly to what the other players are doing. Different players with different abilities and cards to use. Hard and chaotic to maintain. I have some friends who really love it but I just don't think this game was for me. It didn't seem all that special or as a game I want to try again. I own it so I might give it another shot before I trade it away.

(basing on PL version by Portal)

An interesting one. Very well made and produced, Portal at its best. Rules are relatively easy to digest, there are some quirks here and there, but after couple of plays, you will grasp them too. The game lasts about 30-40 mins for 2 player game, the setup time is fairly quick (couple minutes). There is enough diversity in sectors, factions and cards to provide many hours of fun and challenge. There is clearly a passage left for other future factions to join in the Theseus battle. The theme is well conducted graphically, but the don't expect any faction lore or superb shiny art. It's just generic "human space fighters, human scientists, zergs, x files aliens". It doesn't affect the game, though. It could be created as an abstract fighting game, but adding the faction gives it more flavor and thematical "grounding", which is always a good thing. 

The game itself plays according to strict rules and those limitations can pose a problem for certain people. It's also quite a mathy game, because in order to win, you have to process opponent's possible moves ahead of time, visualize the board, and then move your pawns and install cards accordingly. This contributes to AP, but not much (usually you're considering 3 moves tops, in rare situations, up to 6). 

As a gamer's game, it works quite well. There's enough challenge, there's competition and strategies to follow and execute. Those who liked Neuroshima Hex will most certainly like Theseus too, although its mechanics are a bit more convoluted. You will need dozens of plays to understand all the intricacies and the level of depth. So, the famous "easy to learn, hard to master" most certainly applies here.

Update: bumping to 7.5. There's something in this game, but I'm still uncomfortable with the card randomness.

Update: pushing to 7.1. Too chaotic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
After one play I have a very bad opinion about this game. The theme is very pasted on an abstract and illogical mechanic; the first rounds are really slow and boring, and only after some time action finally kicks in. Most turns you have very limited choices, and so many moves are made just because you must do something. Bleah.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Adding asymmetry and removing the sowing aspect makes this an extremely distinctive member of the mancala family. Whether the many disconnects from theme (why can we only move in one direction, etc) bother you seems like a personal issue; I don't mind it at all given how it results in a game where doing well depends on a manageable amount of lookahead.

It's hard to say if the different factions are balanced, since they all play so differently, but the mechanics are tight and it's insanely fun to run around the board laying traps and blasting the competition.

I finally got it for Christmas 2014 - unfortunately, my wife really didn't enjoy it when we played for the first time in January, and I never really intend to play this other than as a 2-player game, so I suspect I'll virtually never get to play this :( I do think it's really interesting, very unique with a lot of tricky tactical decisions, and quite thematic too.

12-08-2015. Rated after 1 play. Theseus is a hard game for me to get to the table. I finally got it to the table and it turns out that I really like the game.

The game aims for you to either damage your opponent (to death), or get other VP tokens. The game ends when someone kills the other player(s), OR if you get 20 tech tokens.
In your turn, you take a marker and move it X spaces, equal to the number of markers in that location (max 4). 

At the location you land on, you trigger the location ability, card abilities and install new cards for abilities.  Very cool.

Theseus hss nice parts, but it's a big box for a small game. The game is a bit too abstract for my tastes, but I like it.

Some interesting ideas in this one, and I think my rating could go up with future plays. I like the asymmetric faction powers, and the game does have a nice, short timeframe. The mancala movement is interesting although can be a cause for AP, plus it can limit your choices. I do think there's a bit of a learning curve to this, and as the alien player, it took me too long to understand how to best utilize them against my opponent, using the marines, which are much more straightforward.

maybe as a 2players game is a different one at all, but 3+ players play just doesn't work (for me) Mechanics are okay, some are neat, yet it feels too chaotic with no meaningful planning. Unsure about 'ballance' but 2/5 of the players' pool not to use at all,weird.

no rating given, it's simply not for me

E: okay, some minor rules were wrong explained, also we didn't use beginners modifications.. But it still feels too chessy, while meaty prefered.. Anyhow I got to crack it, more plays about to come!

E: hmm, not a game for me, the ratio of getting deeper ('finding out' better said) and what's going on is not up to my alley. (pretty brainy but not much hapening inthere at all), otherwise interesting and original concept. 
Control over 'what to install and where' is little to none, so the factions' assymetry shines mostly by the end of the game only..

It never grows old or feels repetitive.

RATING: 7.9
At Essen we only played a tiny fraction of the game, only two player, and with only the basic cards in play.

However, I liked it. Had we been able to play through to completion, I'm pretty certain I'd have bought it too, but getting a 10 minute taster and then being moved on almost implied that there are problems that crop up later (it was actually to clear demo space, but if *felt* like they were hiding the weak underbelly of the game from us).

Update: Theseus is almost entirely an abstract for me. I honestly don't feel any difference playing between the Aliens and the Bots or the Scientists - except perhaps for the more urgent need to upgrade those without attack icons. The cards don't distinguish the factions either in my mind.

But I do really enjoy the game. I've thankfully not played with a slow group and I'd imagine I'd hate it if I did, but played quickly Theseus is a game I really enjoy. I've since added a copy to my collection and I'm keen to find a group where this can hit the table frequently.

Rating up from 7.6 to 7.9.

1. Proste zasady

3. Zróżnicowane strony konfliktu 
4. Grafiki 
5. Mechanika 

Minusy:

Przed rozpoczęciem gry miałem obawy co do ciągłego biegania w jedną stronę i specyficznego podejścia do tematu planszy lecz moje obawy szybko zostały rozwiane i te elementy w połączeniu z mechaniką tworzą bardzo ciekawą rozgrywkę. Zasady są proste ale gra nie jest banalna. Aby wgryźć się w możliwe strategie i nauczyć się składać „kombosy”, które poślą przeciwników w niebyt, potrzeba czasu, czasu i jeszcze raz czasu ale gra jest bardzo regrywalna więc to czysta przyjemność.

Tentative rating after initial two plays with my 9 year old son.

Really this is a very straightforward very tactical game.  Elements of Neuroshima Hex are present, and though I've never played mancala, I've heard that the movement plays out very similarly to how one moves stones in mancala.  I can't formulate very helpful thoughts on the game yet, as I got shredded by the space marines both games.  So if you're here looking for help, I can't give you much.  

I liked it, it's a very well designed game.

A true exercise in futility. You spend many turns just moving to a place to destroy an opponent's card to replace it with one of your own, then your opponent moves there and does the same thing to your card. Repeat for 45 minutes. Besides that, options are very limited and mostly obvious.

The last thing is the randomness. Games can be easily won or lost entirely by pure luck of the draw. Each player has a unique deck of cards and only the top card can be played. Some of the cards are much, much better than others. So if you don't get your good cards until late, or if they're out of the game entirely (you remove a number of cards from the game randomly), you're just out of luck.

I would give this a lower rating but it is a unique take on the mancala mechanism at least, and I'm usually in favor of games that have asymmetric factions. Unfortunately it's just no fun.

I had seen this being played before and it looked pretty interesting, so I was wanting to try it.  The game is fairly interesting.  It's got a mancala-ish movement mechanism, and the game is all about getting your people to advantageous places and getting to trigger cool effects on the cards you've placed.  Additionally the players have asymmetrical powers and are trying to win the game in (at least two) different ways.  So there's some interesting planning that you can do, although things can change a lot, so it tends to be much more of a tactical game.

I liked the game, although my initial game got really wonky at the end.  We ended up in a situation where the person in last place was a huge threat to win, if only they could land on the right spot.  And then a player who had no chance at winning tried to engineer a situation where the threat could be knocked out... and didn't realize that he set up a series of wicked combinations that allowed the player in 4th place to jump out into the win.  I think that maybe five players are a little too many for this game, although I think things will tend to get a little swingy towards the end in any player count.  

Overall it was pretty fun, and it'll fill your "probe" jokes quota for the next few years.

+ Great theme.
+ Good components.

- Poorly written rulebook
- There may be abit too much luck involved for a game of this type.
- No real difference between the races.

I love the asymmetrical factions and the use of the mancala mechanism.

I find this game fascinating and extremely fun. Playing it exclusively with 2, there's definitely room for good play though it feels quite limiting. 

There was a recent game where I lost a pawn due to it being ejected into space and it actually won the game for me. Having one less pawn meant I didn't always have to land in certain spots and it also meant I could control how the opponent could move. Fantastic!

Expansions:
Bots
Space Station Cards
Theseus: The Dark Orbit – Hunters

2p game. medium-fast
point to point mancala movement. each player has deck of cards to associate with each area.
moving to point can trigger cards to have positive/negative effect

Good game, factions play very different from each other.
Game is best at 2p but playable with 3-4p as well if you don't mind the added chaos of deathmatch games or if you play the 4p team-mode.
Best playability is achieved with even number of players. 3p game might work better if one was playing the pandora faction.

Quite good.  The basic mechanic is a familiar mancala derivative, but the additional mechanics make this a very different game.  This designer has a real talent for designing games that have well-balanced factions that play very differently, and it really comes to the forefront here.  The different factions feel quite different, and it's a nice, tight affair with two or three.  The theme looked generic when I first saw the game, but it turns out to be quite evocative when you see that the gameplay is so different for the different factions.

It' not that the game is bad or broken, but I have never been so bored playing a game ever (except that one time I played Munchkin). I can't put my finger on why. There's no long term planning, but other games are like that and are fun. Your card play for advantages usually end up just being short term gains, but other games are like that and are fun. It's just all nah!

My first experience was not bad. Tactical game that plays pretty fast, not that difficult to explain and with a lot of combo possibilities. I certainly want to play this again to see if it stays fun.

Mancala in space. I love the theme and the core mechanics of this game, everything comes together really nicely. Theseus is full of player interaction and tough, crunchy decisions. Each faction feels radically different due to its unique abilities. It's a criminally underappreciated design.

You need to play this game many times in order to master the intricate strategies of every side of the conflict. Well, I'm definitely willing to to this.

[i]I own the following expansions: Bots, Hunters and a dedicated playmat.[/i]

An abstract movement puzzle wrapped in a sci-fi theme. For four players I think the moving based on the number of workers would be too chaotic for us.

I think it is mancala that I don't like.  It just didn't give me a great sense of asymmetry.  The asymm is there, yes, but it wasn't very compelling to me.

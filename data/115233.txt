Great little story telling game. While I am not a big fan of this type of game, this works great, especially for little kids. Bought this, and other sets, for my wife who likes to play games and is a school librarian. She plans on using these to help kids with story telling and language development. She works with students in grades kindergarten, first, and second. She also works with students with special needs and with students who English is their second language.

RATING: 7
While at first I found these more exciting than - and therefore superior to - the original set, I've since come to notice that perhaps because these images are more concrete than the original set, or perhaps because many of their icons have such a strong existing association with known stories,  there's less variety in stories made with this set than the originals, at least when I play with novice story-tellers.  

I think the original set are more often treated abstractly, and the interpretation of most of the dice is wider when using the original set.

Probably not an issue when playing with creative people who know to try harder for alternative icon interpretations or alternative ways to fit even the same icon interpretation into the story.

This set is definitely still a fantastic aid.  Most useful in the case where you think a group of first-time players might benefit from strong hints at well-known story elements.  Just be sure to give the  homely original set another look after being being dazzled and dizzied by all the pirate treasure and kraken battles here.

Voyage themed dice set. A little bit harder images and sometimes it's not that clear, what is depicted. However, this is probably an advantage: you can interpret them as you wish and each time make another meaning to the same image.

I love the basic Rory's set, which I use for gaming. I have no plans to play this set as a board game, so I'm rating them as a GMing aide -- specifically, as ingredients for generating NPCs, plots, etc. They're awesome!

I'm told this is a kids game, but honestly i have just as much fun with it. There are many good variants to play. Our favorite is to take turns telling a story together by rolling one die at a time. this is my favorite set so far. Has more exciting cubes that really lend themselves to telling an epic adventure.

Rory’s Story Cubes: Voyages are one of those simple, yet genius ideas that you come across sometimes. Screamingly obvious idea, but Rory O’Connor picked it up and ran with it and all power to him for doing so. The simple presentation leaves the development of the experience down to the players. Hugely empowering, unlike so many other games which limits what you can do within the constraints of the rules. Here you have free flow and this makes the story cubes tremendous fun for young and old alike.  You can create adventures in so many different areas and in in so many different way. It simply will never play the same way twice and so brings huge replayability. This is a great intro for non-gamers I’d say.

I had fun, laughed, felt stimulated and challenged. I can’t ask more than this from a game. Yes its a game, not just an activity. A different type of game that breaks traditional constraints and challenges your assumptions about what a game can be. And hence, I really admire it and look forward to getting the other 2 sets.

I highly recommend Rory’s Story Cubes: Voyages! Simply put, this is 9 cubes of AWESOME.

Different images on the die faces than the orange box version. This one is more geared toward fantastical journeys with beaches and submarines and castles and giants and pirates. And a pill, for some reason, which naturally is my son's favorite image. These dice are more about spontaneity and on-the-spot creativity than about gaming competitively. As opportunities for play, these things are terrific. 

I've used this set (and others) with my son mainly as bedtime story generators. We mix and match sets, we tell a story on our own, we alternate every-other-die, and we have even had stories where the dice get to interact with one another by moving them around the play surface.

RATING: 6
Ez nem is igazán játék, hanem egy eszköz a meséléshez. Dobunk a kockákkal és a rajtuk lévő szimbólumokat felhasználva kell mondani egy történetet. Itt nincsenek nyertesek vagy vesztesek, csak csupán a szórakozás.

Ami fájó pont lehet, hogy egy maréknyi kockáért nem szívesen ad ki az embert több ezer forintot.

Not necessarily a game, Rory's Story Cubes is basically a facilitator for storytelling. Players roll nine dice with each die featuring six distinctly unique icons. Based on which icons are rolled, players tell stories using the icons provided.

There are three types of Rory's Story Cubes; Voyages is one of them and the Voyages dice focus on action-based storytelling. My wife and sons enjoyed making up stories and encouraging each other's creativity. As I said, this is not a game, but it's a fun way to pass the time.

I use these primarily for coming up with stuff for RPGs (NPCs, plots, my own PC personality, as a random event generator in the Mythic GM emulator etc), but have given a set to my 8yo newphew. We played a round with the whole family right after opening and had a lot of fun - his grandma was skeptical he would have the patience for it, but it kept his attention easily!

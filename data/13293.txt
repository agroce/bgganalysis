Went to Toys R´Us one of this days to buy a toy for my son and saw the DC and Marvel Starter pack on sale for 1.09Euros (something like a buck),bought the pack with the 2 of them and gaved it a try...got a nice surprise in exchange. I really like this game,it seems very balanced so,i guess im going to buy some more starter packs and boosters... ;)

Nothing fancy, just a CCG with a Superhero theme.  Works better than Overpower.  If attacker's damage exceed defender, excess damage became endurance loses.  First one to make opponent lose 50 endurance wins.

RATING: 8
My favorite CCG, love the theme and the resource system.  This one does require a ton of cards to make interesting and tuned decks.  Many of the best cards are rare, of course, but not at all necessary for the game to be fun.  My suggestion for newbies - use proxies for search cards like Mobilize, they even the game out by preventing missed drops, which means more fun for both players.

This Magic clone straddles the border between Magic and the slightly better, more versatile but not as elegant  World of warcraft TCG.  Oh, Yeah.  It's about Marvel heroes and villans.

I still play this with a former colleague. He sponsored me some cards of his collection so that I could build decks with Avengers, Squadron Supreme, Marvel Knights and Crimelords.
Those four decks are all I need for this game while my friend as 6 or 8 different ones to oppose me.
The game has many mechanics similar to MTG, like climatic dynamics due to a manna/recource curve, minion- and permanets- placement, stack/chain of events, triggered and activated abilities, playcost, 20 Life/50 Endurance... 
Basically its the same game! The gameplay feels all the same to me.
But its all with DC and Marvel Characters! How awsome is that?
---Geekpause-silence---
And there is no manna jam in this. With "reservist" characters you even get to circumvent a shortage of plottwists or locations to put in your ressource row.
Another thing I like very much about VS is that, during combat both players usually loose endurance and if both are at a negative lifecount at the end of a Turn the one with less minus wins the game.
I'm happy that the game has been revived as a LCG. They did the same thing as with Netrunner. You, the player, are now represented as the Hero Character (ID Card) and must not be KOd. Played it once with my friend. Its beautiful I think but we still stick to the yet more versatile original.

P.S.: I heard there are classic Aliens in the new expansion.

RATING: 5
I don't know.  Just seemed too simple for my tastes.  I loved a lot of the artwork and the theme.  I didn't care for how simple combat seemed to work.  There were too few abilities and powers.  Maybe the newer expansions have corrected this, but when I played it hadn't been.

I don't even want to admit how much money this game probably ate up. Played from launch up to Green Lantern, then came back from Marvel Team-Up to the bitter end (and then kept playing).

This has a surprising amount of replayability for a game where you only have five "monsters" in the deck.  The different power levels of someone like Cyclops means he could be your early weenie, your middle attacker, or your game ending powerhouse.  And having any card be mana, but some are better at it than others, is a rule every evolved CCG should have *coughmagiccough*.

If there were such a thing as "Advanced Magic: The Gathering," Versus System would be it.  Many of the conventions that make Magic a staple the world over are present in the Versus System, such as the power/toughness combo, life points, tapping, and using cards from your hand to play cards on a one-card-equals-one-resource basis.  But the Versus System throws a number of innovations into the mix, most of which are readily apparent during the hectic and superbly strategic combat phase.

With dozens of teams to play and cool characters based on Marvel and DC superheroes, it's safe to say that Versus System is a great game.  I wish it were never canceled, and that the Arkham Inmates team was a little better. ;)

Got into this little CCG with some friends and had a lot of fun with it for about a year. We're all comic book nerds to some degree and the mechanics were a lot of fun.

First played this on May 6th, 2007.  15 minutes?  Try explaining this in 15 minutes, nope probably not get it all and you will need to refer or go over the rules once into the game.  We played for 90 minutes (guestimate).  Perhaps if you knew all the rules and read all the cards prior to playing, then yes, you could play in 15 minutes.  Ok so, not a quick learn or play.  I did enjoy the game, however with so many questions during the game and lack of insight of strategy this will be down the list of games I would like to play again sometime.  I'd recommend staying away from this game unless of course you are a trading card game type of person that gets into this.  Not me.

Far exceeds what Overpower ever was. I love the Marvel universe so I've been hoping for a good game like this for a while.  I wish it wasn't CCG but at the moment this and HeroClix are the only good superhero games that have yet to be produced. If you're just playing to have fun you can easily get by on a few sets of common/uncommons which I get on ebay. but if you're playing to win tourneys or at the local game store, then you're stuck buying four of each of those rares you'll need, eating a huge hole in your pocket. Good luck with that...

This is an excellent Super-hero themed CCG & should be applauded for actually making it a card game one actually seeks out for BEING a Super-hero CCG.  All the other Super-hero CCGs before this one sucked & were destined to become cat-box litter.  Too bad it's dead now but this is what happens to all CCGs who try & compete with MtG & Pokemon.  WotC will crush you!  I have lots of cards & hope to keep playing in the near-future with anyone who wants to give it a try.

Played this one a lot. VS has a lot of variety for a card game. On the positive side the game is fun and has a great theme. I have no negative comment for the gameplay.

On the negetive side(-1 point), as of most CCG, the game balanced is ok except for the rares (rant:most of the rares are more powerfull than commons and U.c.), and the starters only have 1% of cards that are usable. The game gets relatively expensive If you want competitive decks . Also Be sure to have a lot of spare time to build your decks.

I admittedly have an unjustifiable love for this game, since I played it for so long and made a lot of friends.  The main problem with it was the designers didn't really know what they were doing and made the game worse as time went on.  There were good expansions (Green Lantern) and awful expansions (Legion of Superheroes).  The other problem was that it was fairly easy to make a simple mistake that no amount of luck could help you come back from (not true for a lot of games like MTG).

RATING: 6
The second TCG (after Overpower) that allowed players to create their own dream team of superheroes from both the Marvel and DC universes. While the gameplay could get a kettle slow at times the mechanics were solid, and it does a great job of recreating the feel of the many different characters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.4
Tactics are fantastic.  It uses some of Magic: The Gathering's Tribal mechanics.  The theme is great, I love most things that have to do with DC and Marvel characters.  I would love for this to expand to other comic book worlds, or movies, however Upper Deck stopped printing it!  The artwork is not consistantly good, and the card design isn't quite as great as Magic, but that's ok.  This card game will still be a staple in my card playing circles.

This was the description from the Math Trade where I acquired my cards:

"Includes a number of pre-built decks that need love!

Many rare cards are included! 

Decks include:
JLA (DC Superheros Pump deck)
Fantastic 4 (Fantastic Family of Four)
Thule Society (Evil Nazi mooks from the Hellboy Universe)
Injustice Gang (DC Villians Hand burn)
Illuminati (Marvel Superheros - A Mish-mash that somehow works)
X-Statix (Marvel "superheros" - Kill your friends for the spotlight!)
Hellfire Club (Marvel Villians - Lone wolf in the light)
Skrulls (Shape shifting Marvel villians - Team-up explosion!)

Each of the above mentioned have a 60 card deck that I have constructed.

I will also include the stacks of cards for the factions that are not in the decks.

There are loads of cards. I will not be writing them all down for review. I played this game often and all of the decks have numerous rare cards."

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a deck is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

VS System ist ein Sammelkartenspiel von Upper Deck, welches im Zeitraum von 2004 bis 2009 erhältlich war. In dieser Zeit habe ich VS System sehr intensiv gespielt. Vor allem das Setting war mehr als interessant, immerhin traten in VS System alle großen Comichelden von Marvel und DC gegeneinander an. Eigentlich wollte Upper Deck noch andere Comiclizenzen in das System integrieren, bis auf einen kleinen Gastauftritt von Hellboy, blieb es aber bei Superman und Co. Neben der masse an coolen Superhelden, macht VS System aber auch spielerisch einiges richtig. Zum Beispiel, dass man jede beliebe Karte aus Ressource nutzen kann. Damit umgehen sie das Problem, zu viel oder zu wenig Ressourcen zu haben.Außerdem kann man die Charaktere an vorderster Front, oder in einer "zweiten Reihe" positionieren. So können sich Charaktere mit gleicher Teamzugehörigkeit gegenseitig unterstützen oder beschützen. VS System bietet sehr viele taktische Möglichkeiten und ist auch heute noch ein verdammt cooles Sammelkartenspiel.

RATING: 5
Only played one game with a starter set, and wasn't much impressed. It's a 2 card draw per turn, but you want to play a card each turn into your resource row most turns to give you adequate purchase power, so you're effectively drawing one playable card/unit a turn. And if one player draws better playable cards early, they get their snowball going, get a lead, and it's hard to see comebacks being generate-able with 1 card draw per turn. With starter sets anyway. The combat was a pretty dull calculatable affair, with no random elements other than the revealing and playing of events. Anyway, I didn't see any gameplay reason to prefer this over any other number of more interesting LCGs/CCGs out there, leaving the theme as its interest. And it's not my kind of theme.

Easy to learn and a quick play.  A few friends, as well as myself, got into this after being sick of every other CCG we played, while still wanting to find one that was actually worth sticking with.  Much better than any superhero CCG/TCG (Overpower, X-Men, Recharge) I've played, and better than most CCGs in general.  If you're into comic books and want to try out a CCG, this is definitely the one to play.  Art was awful in the initial set but keeps getting better with each expansion.  I thought this would bomb at first, but it's a pleasant surprise indeed.

RATING: 8
players build 60 card decks, consisting of mostly character cards, but also plot twists, locations, and sometimes equipment cards. each turn, players first draw two cards, then they take turns playing a resource, and "recruiting" characters into play.  a resource is simply any card in a players hand. the card is played into the "resource row" face down and will later generate a resource point for the player. players get to spend these points to recruit characters, much like playing a creature in magic.  the twist here is that plot twist cards and location cards can be turned face up, once certain conditions are met--usually just having a threshold cost equal or less than the current number of resources you control. these cards usually effect the game and characters in play in certain ways. this is a pretty cool mechanic and nicely gets around magic's main problem--drawing into too many or too few lands. 


the simultaneous turns, takes a little getting used to, but it starts to click halfway through the first game. i'll have to admit i'm a sucker for the theme of this particular ccg. getting to build and pilot a green lantern deck featuring g'nort and rot lop fan is just too cool, for a dork like me anyway. another plus for this game is that it's considerably cheaper to get into than magic. a few starters and boosters should be more than enough to satisfy the curious and those can be had for rather cheap via various online discounters, or ebay. (you can often find lots for a larger but, still modest investment, at least in terms of price per card and what the cost would be to acquire those cards in a more traditional manner.)    

i'm loving this game right now.

Not really interested in this one until the boxes/cases make their way to the bottom of the clearance bins (but wanted to go ahead and add it to my list so that I do not forget) and I can obtain in bulk.  Probably not even worth discussing unless nobody in your area plays any more and you are just looking to dump your collection and at least get something rather than nothing (i.e. throwing the cards in the dumpster to make room for new stuff).  Looking to pay about "nn" cents per unplayed (or played but mint) booster (a bit more for starters) [or offer "nn" cents per/ in trade value if trading].  
nn = 16.  
Will bulk trade my MtG cards at 10:1 (10 VS for 1 MtG).

I own the GenCon preview edition of the Vs. System relaunch.  This was a collection of old cards with the old rules advertised as the relaunched Living Card Game (before they realized they couldn't use that name).

This annoys the hell out of me because it was a real bait and switch.  This looks nothing like the game that just came out, which I actually quite enjoy.  As such none of these cards are usable with the new game and they changed them so that they can't even be used with the old game.  It is its own miniature thing that has very little use.

An interesting CCG that offers players some challenging tactical choices (especially in regards to placing characters in the front row or the support row, and which characters to attack and when). The use/placement of resources from cards in the main deck is clearly a mechanic Fantasy Flight has picked up for some of its newer "living card games." The Vs. System offers a nice way to have some of your favorite comic characters clash in battle, but the theme suffers a bit from allowing multiple versions and multiple copies of characters in a deck (meaning when a character is KO'd (in the parlance of the game), it is likely to make a near-instantaneous, inexplicable reappearance). The game also seems prone to runaway victories when one side or the other draws a powerful character at the right time. But all in all, it's a pretty well-constructed - and more importantly, fun - game. Vs. System isn't perfect, but it's well worth checking out, especially for fans of superheroes and better-than-average CCGs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.3
good game mechanics, and not too pricey if you're just looking for quick, casual fun. of course, there's always the urge to enhance your deck... but if you do not feel the need to jump on the tournament/competition/spendlotsofmoney-bandwagon, you can stick to the early sets (up to the Justice League at the moment), which are really quite cheap to come by. Unfortunately, the german translation is a sad joke.

Currently I just own a random assortment of cards (168 total) from the DC Origins set. But I've also played with some Marvel cards via the Marvel TGC PC game.

RATING: 6
The Vs. system is one of those games that I dislike even though I can see that it is a quality game design. In a lot of ways, Vs. is the best hardcore CCG ever made. There is so much deck control that a player can pretty much dictate exactly how a given match will play out. That's quite an accomplishment and a big reason why so many people love it...and probably one of the main reasons I don't.

First off, such tightly regimented deck designs lead to very few viable decks. It's almost like Upper Deck puts the team together for you and you are just collecting the pieces. Secondly, knowing exactly what character is probably coming out on every turn for both your own and your opponent's deck also makes things feel very scripted to me. Finally, these Vs. designers love their card buffs. In a lot of decks, almost every card interacts with every other card on the table. It gives an experienced player a lot of tactical options, but a new player a lot of headaches.

Granted, I play casually. These features appeal to hardcore CCG players, and again, I see why gameplay of this sort appeals to them. It's just not for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This was a lot more fun than I expected it to be. Reading the rules, I'd dismissed it as a Magic clone with more deckbuilding restrictions (and it is amusing in the rulebook to see them tripping over themselves to not use terms like "tap"), but the changes are very thematic, even somewhat intuitive if you know the characters. I still think the rock-paper-scissors of Overpower is more interesting, but if I ever exhaust my interest in that particular dead CCG, I might just start playing this more often.

Too bad the TCG format killed it. Best expansions for me are MVL, DCL and MUN. The reboot was really an improvement as it streamelined the mechanics and introduced the legend cards.

My rating is if I still owned and played the game.  It just got too expensive too quickly for me, though the game system is wonderful.  Thought provoking and strategic, gameplay provides many interesting choices...though luck of the draw is still present (though, you'll have that in any card game, right?)

I used to have many more of these cards, but the deckbuilding wasn't fun for me, not like it is in Magic, so I got rid of all my cards and just kept the Hellboy 2-player set. It comes prebuilt and I really dig that more than most other comic characters.

One of my favorite CCGs.  Great design. Lots of play differences between teams. Cards and mechanics that can appeal to comic book fans.

Is good, but takes an age to get your head round the timing rules, and, much like Magic, he who's purse is deepest does best.

Updated: With reference to 'Trump', I cannot understand how you can say that those that spend the money don't stand a better chance of winning - just take a look at the winning decks, how many of those have 4x Savage Beatdown (a $30+ card)?
That said, I still dig the game a lot, and have increased my score for it

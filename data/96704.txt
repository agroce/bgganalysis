I got in a play of this older game - which I seem to recall, but wasn't on my radar. It's in general an abstract game where you place your tokens on a grid of 4 boards (so the play area changes each game). The trick here is each token has a span of control - from 1 to 4 spaces with some variety for different terrain. You can't place a token in any row or column where you have previously played. And you can't place on one of the four boards where an opponent just played. After all the tokens are placed, game over. Count up the number of grid spots you 'control' with your tokens. The trick there is the tokens are resolved in numeric order - so low values (which have less control area) are resolved first and then high values (which have large control area). So it's a thinking game. I commented how it wouldn't be nearly as interesting on an iPad or such - you could easily determine which area was controlled and it would take away the strategy.

I didn't win my game - I was too busy contending over the central areas while the winner slipped outside and controlled the uncontentious border areas. 

I liked the experience, but it's not the kind of game I normally seek out.

RATING: 7
A game that has risen a little in my estimation with each successive play. Fealty treads a fine line in its efforts to be a quick, simple neo-abstract.  It limits your choice of a piece to place to three each turn and limits where you can place it (not on the same board section as an opponent's piece placed earlier this turn, not in the same column or row as a friendly piece).  Many pieces have special powers, but none of them are very powerful.  Initially it felt as though the game was playing me. It takes a while to appreciate how to play effectively within those constraints and to make the most of those muted powers. Scores remain close because the game doesn't offer the potential for dramatic knock downs.

So far as variability is concerned, Fealty flatters to deceive.  The pieces are double sided, with a different character on each side.  Yet those two sets of characters aren't strongly differentiated.  Similarly, there are six double-sided boards, yet all offer a pretty similar mix of terrain.  Perhaps something more radical will come with the promised expansions.

Both the production and artwork are functional if unexciting.  The rules are an easy read and seem complete.  The game rattles around in an outsized box.

An unbelievably good game. In my search for games to add to my collection, one of my goals is to find games that demonstrate the type of advanced strategy required in ancient masterpieces like chess, but with a more modern mechanical structure. This is the best of those I have found so far. I have already played it many times, and I still feel like the game's true depth of strategy eludes me.

First play...interesting and relatively short.  Need to play a few more times to get a better understanding of it. 

On subsequent plays...this is a good game with interesting spatial and sequencing considerations.  This game can be played quickly and nicely, and the scoring, while taking a curious amount of time, is actually fun for me.  Let's score this thing!

In the way of downsides...the fiddliness caused by the restrictions of not being able to place in the same duchy as previous plays that round, and the same row or column you previously placed in, unfortunately, prevents the game play from actually soaring, at least for the average gamer.  Thus, Fealty flies very nicely, but it does not soar with enjoyment, which is a shame, since the game is so good.  I still love it; it's a very good game that borders upon being great.

RATING: 6
An abstract, somehow I'd assumed this was a war game. The sprinkle of luck is slightly disappointing to the pure abstract fan I am. It seems on first sitting minimal though. This rating may rise a touch with further plays. Interested in playing it 3+.

RATING: 7.5
One of my favourite 'short' games, as Fealty really is playable within 30-45 minutes (and even faster with 2 players).  A fantastic level of strategy packed into such a nice little package.  The box is annoyingly large, but it's fine that this is my biggest complaint with the game. 

[Updated April 2012]
I still enjoy Fealty, although it has become very dry.  I don't find this actually impacts my view of how good the game is, but I do feel somewhat less inclined to play it.  The game can also bog down a little as it is very, very tactical and very hard to have a strategy outside of an order to how you're playing your pieces.

RATING: 10
Edit: Moving it up to a 10.  Still haven't even played the "5" sides yet, but just a great, tight, abstract game.

Great little gem.  Got a chance to play this at BGG.CON 2011 with the designer.  The design is super elegant and the rules so simple that you can pick it up in under 5 minutes.

However, simple mechanics do not a simple game make.  Each play has significant impact on the entire board and there are a lot of tactical moves that players can make.  I can see lots of re playability because of the random play order, different tile sets, and the "*5" pieces.  

Support a small game designer and pick this game up!

Probably great as an app which immediately shows you the spaces you can influence with your chosen piece.

RATING: 3
One play, 4P, found the experience abysmal.  Seemed like more of an optimization puzzle than a game, and it also seemed that outside of the card selection, near-optimal tactical play could be achieved - if one wanted to stare at the board long enough.  For me, these kind of events are awkward either way, because you're either making knowingly less-informed decisions or screwing the whole table over while they sit on their hands and wait for your AP to resolve.  The vertical/horizontal/optimization bits reminded me of Reiner Knizia's Kingdoms, which I don't love, but definitely prefer on all levels.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.6
Was having high hopes for this, but am surprised by just how well I like it. There's quite a bit to learn here; will take a while before you play this game well. Blocking options are not instantly intuitive, and there's very elegant interplay between the different pieces. Loads and loads of replayability due to the different boards and sets of cards.

The game slows down quite a bit with four players, due to the larger board (meaning more placement options to evaluate for each player, _and_ more players to wait on) - I would recommend sticking to just 2 or 3 players.

This is an amazing game. The box art is not really enticing and there are no art on the cards per se, the game play and mechanics of the game is very smooth and more than make up for it. Definitely an underrated game and I agree with Tom Vasel that this is a great buy.

The setup is very fast and the keeping of the components is very quick as well. Like the fact that both the players review their cards simultaneously and then the card with the faster speed (lower number) goes first.

Bumped up from a 6 to an 8. Starting to get traction with this as a 2-player opener with members of my regular gaming group. Played with the standard rules, this is a 6 for me, but the no luck variant bumps it up to an 8.

Old Comment: Room for cleverness abounds. The closest comparison I can make is to Samurai. Players simultaneously choose a piece to play on the board. The faster a piece is, the earlier in the turn order it will be placed, with all of the inherent advantages of going early. However, faster pieces also convey less influence overall. The game is primarily tactical, but delicious in the clever ways in which you can enact tactics.

Okay, I remember seeing this when it came out.  The looks weren't appealing at all.  I was meh.  I then got a chance to play this multi-player abstract game and it was VERY cool.  You play cards to play your pieces on the board to hopefully control area.  Your hand of three cards is chosen at random.  I could see where this could be even more intense by going with a completely unrandom hand. I think my brain would splode!  

I was very pleasantly surprised by this one.

RATING: 8
A bit worried that this 2-4 player game about placing tiles due to a card draw with placement constraints based on what you've already played and special powers would feel similar to Kingdom Builder and that would be a non-starter. Fortunately, it feels like a friendlier Neuroshima Hex, which is what I was hoping for. It's a bit hard to visualise after only play due to how influence is counted at the end, but I think it has some potential for clever play.

RATING: 8
Very pleasantly surprised. I haven't tried the 2v2, which is what I was looking forward to, but having played now a couple times 3p, I think that may be the week spot. The board would be pretty busy with 4, and I don't see a way for players to work together. It's more like taking any vp game under the sun and saying it's team-based just by adding scores together. Blah. But really, this is a quite nice game. The board setup is extremely variable, which is fantastic. You'll never play the same board twice. Comparisons with Neuroshima Hex are spot on, but I think I might like this even better. NH can feel very swingy, but in this one you're constantly building, with just one "battle" at the end. There's kind of a "8 queens" problem where the board is a grid and you can never play into the same row/column where you already have, which makes for highly constrained options towards the end. It's a big box game, but is really more like a super filler. The only randomness is the order that your cards come out in. Highly recommended.

Usually I find abstracts a little boring , but this gem breaks the mold and infuses a small dose of theme and tons of variability. I can see pulling this out as a two
player game or for team royal battles. The game gives just enough cerebral tension to make it both interesting and infuriating at the same time. Those faster smaller characters sure can screw up your well laid plans. Some people may dislike this aspect of the game. I like how
you can shorten/lengthen the game and give players
restricted/comprehensive choices on what to play. Use a
chess clock when playing against AP prone players.

One of those games with many elements that I like: modular gameboard, duplicate resources, and possible to play in a variety of "modes" (pure abstract, card-drawing, etc).

I really like this one! Lots of great tactical back and forth!

It's fun right from the first play but I imagine it gets much deeper when you can guess at your opponent's moves. I like that there's a limited amount of AP in choice of piece since you know you will probably have to improvise in placement anyway.

Fealty is my type of game: extremely simple mechanics, lots of depth, and the feeling you can always play better. The hand of card is a nice touch: the order in which you draw them has little impact, but the limited options greatly speeds-up the game. The overall placement/territorial mechanics is surprisingly simple but works wonders.

Rating is for the 2-player game. I still have to try it with more but I have the feeling 2-player is the sweet spot for me as it gives me the warm fuzzy feeling of an excellent abstract.

RATING: 7
Fealty is certainly better than the rating it has on BGG.  I'm a fan of abstracts in general and usually I'll only shun an abstract if it's too derivative.  Fealty has some unique things going for it, so that was appreciated.  The restrictive placement rule is an interesting thing to consider (though not something one can plan for in the long-run) and the way each piece deals influence but at different times is also smart.  Later pieces influence more spaces, but at the risk of earlier pieces (with shorter influence range) influencing spaces earlier on. So that is the main crux and an interesting point to think about as you place your pieces.  The game can be quite analytical and AP if you're considering it too much. Probably just to play casually and make the best decision for the moment without attempting to intuit every repercussion. That would bog the game down considerably. I can see this not being a game for those who need to see the repercussions quickly. Fealty doesn't exactly allow for this, which makes it a bit of an odd-ball game.  It's greatly dependent on placement and control but doesn't allow for an easy view of what's to come. So the game can really only be enjoyed by those who like abstracts but don't worry too much about it.  I say there's enough here to enjoy quite a bite.  Unfortunately, there is also a lot of box to enjoy. My lord, why is the box sooo large for such a conservative number of pieces?!

Played this a couple of times so far... was extremely surprised (pleasantly!) to find that this is feels pretty abstract.

Comparisons to Carcassonne are inevitable due to theme and similar game elements, but I actually felt the gameplay to be a bit like Carcassonne also. I think it was the way you have to draft the pieces you play... not entirely sure.

There are a lot of folks talking about how fast this plays... and yes, it is fairly short, but it did not feel fast to me. It's a brain burner, plain and simple. My brain loves to burn though.

This is a neat little game that behaves like an abstract; the theme could have been anything. To me, it feels like Go, Shogi, and Black Box. It is an area control game much like Go--you place your pieces down, and each controls the surrounding landscape, subject to obstacles such as mountains and other players' pieces. The pieces behave like in Shogi--each has different influence patterns and/or ranges; they are ranked in priority to determine which neighboring piece(s) controls a specific space on the board; some have special powers. Each piece emanates an influence pattern, something like ray tracing, which reminded me of Black Box. It looks like it scales nicely from 2 to 4 players. Not bad for a kick-starter game, and not bad for a somewhat meatier, but relatively short filler. It's a '7'.

Fealty is an early Asmadi publication and the production quality is that of an early game, with lots of clip art and hazy, generic board art. Ugliness aside, I do enjoy some aspects of the game play and was hoping to like this more than I do. Players have a personal deck of 9 cards and a hand of 3. Each turn, players play a face-down card from their hand. All cards are flipped and actions are taken in the order of lowest numbered card to the highest. An action involves taking the appropriate game piece and placing it on to the board by a simple (albeit, seemingly arbitrary) set of restrictions. Each piece creates influence for the player in different distances and terrain types on the map - which will be scored at the end of the game. In the meantime, players place pieces with the intent of gaining influence and creating blockers for pieces previously placed by other players. The spaces that you can influence at the point of placement are less likely to be maintained the earlier you place it. This causes you to reassess each piece's situation every turn as the game evolves. If you have players that are AP prone and have difficulty visualizing frequently changing board states, they should stay well away from this title!

When each player has placed eight pieces the game is over, and each piece generates influence going from low cards to high cards and influence tokens are physically placed on the board. The placing of influence is blocked by every piece on the board except your own influence. So even though low numbered pieces have short and specific ranges, they will gobble up spaces the larger more extensive pieces want to score. In the end, the player that was able to place the most influence wins and game can be surprisingly close given the seeming chaos of ever-changing game states. In the end, because there are so many things that block influence, the outcome can feel a little out of your control and this, in an abstract placement game, is tough to swallow. There is an iOS app for this which I think shows the evolving state of influence as things are placed, which would improve the play experience dramatically, I wager. As for the board game, I feel there are games that accomplish similar things in a more satisfying way.

Goddammit.  I like this game, I really do.  It's the very first game I ever Kickstarted.  It plays well, it plays fast, and it really does have some nice strategic elements for a game in the 15-20 minute range.  

But man, I wish they had spent some time on the art assets.  The "duchies" all look the same, even though they're not, and while having the influence mechanics of the various pieces shown on the pieces themselves is nice, it misses out on an important opportunity to add some visual appeal to a game that needs it.  It's as if they tried to be half abstract strategy game and half medieval territorial control game, and never really achieved the look and feel of either. As a result, friends never seem to choose Fealty over other games when it comes to game-time.

My other big issue with this game is the box, which is huge - the size of Dominion's box, even though all the pieces could have fit easily in a box with about a third of that volume.  I know it's a minor issue, but Asmadi Games should have a bit more respect for shelf-space.

An interesting abstract area control game that rewards active thinking, at the right time. This game is quite simple to teach, and aside from the placement restrictions isn't too much of a hassle for a new player to grasp. The game can become somewhat AP prone, but if all players agree that they will never get max value on their placements, due to unforeseen plays later in the game, then the game can advance smoothly.

A rather deceptively complex abstract that takes at least a few plays before you understand the long term ramifications of placement. 

You simply have to be aware of what the tile is, how it gathers points and how to place it so that you at least get a few points for it. An average of 5 per piece will win you the game, so it's easy to think "oh I would have gotten 15 before I was surrounded, now I get 2" but it's the big picture that experience brings.

Combined with having yet another complete variant set included in the box there's long legs in this box; the box is a bit oversized though :)

Fast abstract filler - 15-30 min game play.

See rpg.net review.

Same specs as ATON and KAHUNA: Area control. Hand Management. Plays in or under 30 minutes. 2 Players. 

Sells for the ridiculously high price of $30 plus $9 for shipping on the publisher's website. VERDICT: Wait until we can afford it. (NB: The box is 12x12, although the game looked like a card game). There is a PnP version of the game.

Coloring is a little drab.

This is really an abstract game.

The reviews for this game are overwhelmingly positive.

I enjoy short, tactical abstracts with a bit of randomness. This one has a random board setup and a random card draw that gives you some control over the order in which you place your pieces.

This game feels quite unique and I suspect has a good bit of depth due to piece placement rules and the order of influence scoring (from low to high level pieces).

Bizarre form of area control, we played the basic game, 9 cards to choose from, one in each of 8 rounds. Everyone starts with the same cards, shuffled, 3 in hand, play one, draw back up to 3. Cards represent a character type which can take control of fields, roads and cities in the surrounding area based on adjacency. Some in cross form, some in a general surrounding area. With 4 players, each takes turns to place their piece as indicated by the card ranging from most powerful to least powerful. Person from the round placing the least powerful character becomes the "Heir Apparent" in the following round. Placement of pieces is on a grid requiring that placement be on a different row/column from that already occupied by the player. Only One player can place in any single location, some peices give powers to move other pieces, place loyalty marker or conflict marker. Conflict markers along with mountains become obstacles to gaining of territory.

Upon completion of 8 rounds, players starting from the "Heir Apparent" place loyalty markers according to surrounding rules for the pieces they have placed on locations not already with pieces or loyalty markers, cities claimed gaining two loyalty markers. Tally up the loyalty markers and you have yourself the winner with the most. I spend more time writing this than I would to rushing out to play the game again. It's mechanics might be different, just not that appealing.

Note for colour blind people: Whilst pieces are augmented with some different line based decals, they are small in printing and difficult to distinguish if that was required to overcome colour blindness.

[-]Fealty looks and feels cheap. The boards, wooden components and cards are all fine, but they appear to be a DTP job done by an experienced amateur. I wonder if this first impression dominated my thinking?[/-]*

*Turns out this was a pre-release copy of the game.

The board is modular and has multiple orientations. Over ten rounds the players place pieces that exert control over neighbouring and nearby spaces. The objective is to control the most spaces at the end. Some pieces control more space, but take effect later in sequence, and may therefore miss-out on influencing spaces already claimed by others. There are some placement rules and minor bells-and-whistles, but basically that's it. Perfectly OK, but with little spark.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game is very abstract, placing pieces on the board. Each piece at the end of the game will score squares in its range (and in its terrain type) that haven't been scored by pieces with a lower speed value already, because they get to claim spaces first. So if you put out your high numbered pieces first, they'll get surrounded by lower numbered (but also lower range) pieces that will pick off its spaces first. Meaning you don't want to play your low pieces too early either. And that's the decision point throughout out the game - choose which piece to play of the three you've drawn, and then decide where to place it. That placement decision can deliver some serious analysis paralysis though, trying to pick the most fruitful spot that's least likely to be picked off. And that's the game's main problem - it's a simple mechanic (which is good!), but there's too much downtime and too much potential for king-making for the game to be truly enjoyable.

Take Go, add randomness, make some intersections worth more than others, and have some stones influence only certain types of intersections and you might have something approximating Fealty.

For many people the above description may be a stretch, just as it would be a stretch to describe chess as checkers in which different pieces move in different manners. But the above is an accurate depiction of my own personal impressions.

Neuroshima Hex - the Area Control version.  Has the "initiative" or "speed" concept much like that found in N.Hex, but now trying to use it to gain area instead of conflicts with another player.

Variable boards and two options likely to enhance replay for those who like this sort of game, but at its heart an abstract game of area control.  Great if you can visualize each piece's projection and the interplay between the two, likely to be a slog if you can't.

--Nov2012-- Simple (though not at all trivial) area control game.  The balance between rules load and game weight is nice.  But the game, to me, felt bland and characterless.
--Nov2012-- The more I think about it, the less I'm amused:  the "real" decisions are obscured by the board.  I'd said "Completely Calculation is possible" before - and that's not the case.  But a VR-enhanced version of the game (imagine touching a unit, and seeing sparklines indicating delta-influence on each possible placement on the board) would dramatically improve the clarity, while enabling the interesting decisions.

RATING: 6
The idea seems like a good one, but unfortunately the fiddliness makes it a bit of a chore. It's reasonably simple with a few placement restrictions. However, marking all the points scoring areas makes this better suited as a computer game than a board game.

Not a bad effort, a bit ordinary, but there's also this feeling that I'd just rather play something else that requires less micro bookkeeping. The more you play it the more you'll see opportunities for clever play. Certainly the lower numbered pieces with less range being stronger than the more outwardly expansive pieces is a clever mechanic.

The more players you add the more swingy it gets. It can get a little nuts. I think I prefer as a two player game - three at most.

No idea why it comes in such a big box. This might have stayed in the collection if it didn't take up so much shelf space. This might have stayed in the collection if it had come in a more portable box.

A fast abstract thinker. Makes even the fastest player bog down in decision-making angst. DO NOT PLAY WITH AP-PRONE PEOPLE. 

The rule about not being able to play in the same row and column as a previous piece is incredibly frustrating--in a good way. 

I liked it, and would play it again given a sufficient dose of Advil beforehand.

1 play, 2-player

A clever abstract area control game. SIMPLE rules but satisfyingly deep play. Should play relatively quickly as long as you don't have too much AP (although you can't help but have a little in this game!). I'm generally not a fan of totally abstract games (and the them here is very thinly painted on) but this one is actually pretty good!

--- Summary ----
The board is constructed from n+1 tiles ("Duchies"), which show a grid filled with different mixes of fields, forests, roads, cities, and mountains. Players each have an identical deck of 9 cards (2 sets supplied with game; basic and advanced). The cards are numbered and each correspond to a token to be placed on the board. The info on the card (number, type of space and range of coverage, extra power) are all summarized on the tile. The extra power, if present, is generally something like move a tile a few spaces, or place a "conflict token" on the board, etc. Everyone shuffles their deck and draw a hand of 3 tiles. 

Each round, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card; take turns in ascending order (ties broken in favor of player who was last in previous turn, or clockwise from that player). On your turn, place the matching token onto a duchy that no other player has played onto this turn. Also, may not place a token on the same row or column as any of your other tokens. Then, use the card power (if any). 

Play 8 rounds. Then, resolve all tokens in ascending order. For each token, place an influence marker (or 2 if placing onto city) onto any tile within range and that is uncontested (ie not within reach of another player's token of the same rank). Your reach is determined by token (various ranges, and some only extend in a + pattern) and is blocked by mountains and any token already on the board other than your own markers (count distance orthogonally). The player with the most influence markers on the board wins!

This is one of those rare games I have to rate according to what it is vs. what I personally think about it.  (NOTE: BGG's rating system is illogically flawed - games are rated subjectively based on what they aren't instead of what they are.  With a few exceptions, I rate according to how I see a game's worth regardless of how I feel about it.)

Fealty has been compared to Kingdom Builder.  KB is the far simpler game.  I rate KB lower.  However, I think KB is more fun to play.  I say that because Fealty really is a heavy thinking game.  It looks simple, but it's very mathy.  It's very chess-like.  And that's not meant as an insult.  If you like abstract games like this then definitely check out Fealty!  I think it's a great game.  It's not great for me.  I was hoping for something closer to KB's lightness.

(1.12 - after 1 4p game)  We played with the carsds ending in 0's and the shorter 6 cards played rather that 8 in our learning game which means we did not each get the same cards out there.

I neat game of claiming territory based on patterns/terrain types per each card.  Low card # units claim first, once claimed, no one else can.   Only 1 unit card allowed per player per row, per column - you can't double up.

With 4p the board will fill up and be careful if playing with overly analytic gamers with this one who might suck the fun out of it.

Look forward to more plays.

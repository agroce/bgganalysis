Lots of fun. I really think this is an excellent game because it's implementation is fantastic. The look, feel, sound are just right. Played to 5 points is just right. Playing through the whole deck the way my daughter likes to do is just too much. I'd rate this higher if I could keep my sessions shorter.

I often play this game with kids at my church.  If you add in some extra rules (like you can't set any of the beakers down), adults can play this alongside kids and enjoy it as well.  It has been a huge hit with the kids though.  I think about 10 years old has been the sweet-spot, age wise, but I've played with kids as young as 4 and had it go well.

I really like how Dr. Eureka combines both dexterity and logical thinking.  Kids are learning and improving their motor skills with this game and don't even realize it.  It gets a 6 from me because I would never pull this out except with kids, but it is a smash-hit of a kids game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I don't always go in for dexterity games, but this one is pretty neat, requiring some logical skill as you shift the spheres from test tube to test tube before your opponents can. It's fast, pressure-filled fun that the whole family can pick up on, and the components are solid. Blue Orange rarely lets us down, and this is no exception to that trend.

A simple puzzle-style game of moving balls between test tubes to match the card. Presentation and components are excellent. This is really closer to a filler game as you'll probably play this for 8-10 rounds (and rounds are super quick) and then you'll be satisfied. A great game to play with kids and adults together.

This is a dexterity game about trying to get your chemicals (plastic balls of 3 different colors) in the right order in your vials. The catch ius that you can't touch the chemicals with your hands, and they can't hit the table or your out of the round.

This falls into that category like animal upon animal where it's mostly a kids game, but can be perfectly fun with adults in the right context.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very clever, can be fun but it has that issue that a game like SET has where the most skilled player will trounce everyone else. Because the game is decided by who wins each round, less skilled players have nothing to grab on to. Second place gets nothing and you're not building anything long term so you have nothing to appreciate besides your gradual increase in skill. For this reason it can definitely lack fun for some of  the participants at the table.

It also pales in comparison to something like Ghost Blitz because it's very much a solitaire experience. In a game like Ghost Blitz or Jungle Speed we're all sharing a physical play space so I can at least revel in hilarious moments that occur, but here I have no idea what's up until someone shouts "done!" and I'm left in the cold with the puzzle half completed and just need to restart.

I think this game would actually be more enjoyable watching others play than participating if you are not skilled. That to me is an indictment.

This game is a lot of fun. I think the game can be equalized handicapping good players by forcing them to hold all three test tubes at all times - it would make younger kids competitive with the adults.

Another dex game to play with my 5-year old daughter. This is still a little advanced for her so our first play was more just focused on understanding how to get the patterns down and after about 5 or 6 cards she was doing pretty well for herself. However, even after that I can see the potential this game has to be a good puzzle game for her. The speed part will take some time, but seeing her able to figure out how to move the molecules between the test tubes has already been a lot of fun for me. My wife says she wants to try it out with me and in a game like this she is bound to win. Great Target pickup.

Family/kid game.  We picked it up on Prime Day 2016 at a deep discount.

It's a fast-paced spacial puzzle.  Normally spacial/puzzle games are not my favorite, but the theme and quick resolution balance it out.  We play it with the the kids (4 and 7).

I like it for the variety, simple-puzzle solving skills for the kids, and the components are cool.

Cute little party/dexterity game. Thought it would be a nice little alternative filler game and was pleasantly surprised. Even though it looks simple the pressure of racing other people mounts on you and little mistakes seem egregious. Only thing I'd suggest is maybe an expansion/ reprint with another colour/4th test tube. Worth the cheap price!

A really ridiculous, easy to teach, and quite fun dexterity game that can be thinkier than you'd expect at first glance.  Dr. Eureka would be a solid 7 for me if they chose a combination of colors that are colorblind friendly.  The red/green balls are extremely difficult to distinguish, so I am unable to play the game at all in certain lighting conditions.  This is something Blue Orange games has been guilty of in lots of their titles =(

Dr. Eureka
MFG: Blue Orange Games
#of Players: 1 ‚Äì 4
Age Range: 8+
Overall Construction:  This is a different kind of game. There are 12 ‚ÄúTest tubes‚Äù. The reason I put this in quotes is because, they are a hybrid of Test Tubes & Graduated Cylinders. They are made of a nice durable plastic. There are 24 balls/marbles that are perfectly sized for the tubes. They appear to be made of a highly durable plastic, which is a good thing because they fall on the floor a lot. I have yet to see one get chipped or broken. The cards are small and square, of decent card stock, and not so small that they‚Äôre difficult to shuffle. Lastly, the rule book is the same size as the cards, has an accordion design, & has very clear, easy to read graphics and rules.
Gameplay:  Each player has 3 test tubes with 2 balls each. 1 set red, 1 green, & 1 purple. Look at the rulebook for the starting configuration. Shuffle the deck of cards and flip the top card, revealing the configuration that you need to achieve. All players compete to make their test tubes match the ones on the card. When they do, they shout ‚ÄúEUREKA!‚Äù and their handy work is checked. If they are correct, they win the card. If they are wrong, they have to wait until their opponents finish the round. You want to collet 5 cards. If you want to play a longer game, you can always try to reach a higher max of cards. 
This doesn‚Äôt sound hard to accomplish, but you are not allowed to touch the balls with your hand & they are not allowed to fall to the playing surface or lower. You are allowed to flip your tubes upside down to match the patterns if need be, just make sure you don‚Äôt lose your balls.
Yes/No Recommend: Yes, Yes, Yes. This is a great game for the budding science geek or people just wanting to race their way through a game. The kids I played this with rated it an A+ for fun. It‚Äôs funny watching the clever ways that people shift the balls around to match the patterns. It helps build up your hand eye coordination, as well as puzzle solving skills. 
I will say that I have seen games like this in the past, but the way it is presented with it‚Äôs Science motif makes it really stand out. This is another game that I would play with kids who are under the recommended age limit, even if we‚Äôre not playing by the rules, because I feel that the basics of this game can aid in the development of young minds.
Where To Get It: This game is basically brand new, so it might not be available in many places yet. The first place I will send you to check is your local game stores, if they don‚Äôt have it, they can at least order a copy. If you would like more information on this game and other Blue Orange games feel free to check out their website here http://www.blueorangegames.com/games/dr-eureka

Dr. Eureka is a puzzle game involving tipping various test tubes full of colored balls into one another in an attempt to match a pattern on a card. It's a simple concept, but really has a lot of thematic resonance. Everyone immediately relates to both the concept of the mad scientist as well as easily understanding the goal. From there it's about logic, speed, and a touch of dexterity.

The puzzles aren't really difficult to figure out, just to figure out faster than someone else. For that reason, there isn't enough depth or challenge to play on a regular basis, but as a kids game or a quick filler it can be a lot of fun.

Everyone have tubes with colored balls in them.  A card is drawn that shows a certain arrangement of balls in the tubes. You're trying to match the card by transferring balls from one tube to another while touching only the tubes. If you finish first, you win the card; if you collect 5 cards, you win the game. Mildly amusing, but not a game I would want to play much.

Dr. Eureka combines dexterity, speed and logic. Each player has three cylinders, each containing two balls in different colors per cylinder. The task of the players is to recreate the color combinations from a task card the fastest. As the starting combinations of the players will differ from the second puzzle, a task can be decided from the beginning but this effect should balance out over the course of the game.

A stressful game that reminds me how old I really am but one of the best in this genre. I couldn't imagine playing this more than once in a session but a good closer and probably great with kids.

It's interesting how much of the enjoyment I have derives from the tactile pleasure of transferring the balls and hearing the clicks and clacks of all the balls hitting the test tubes. It's just very satisfying, and a great way of introducing dexterity into a fairly standard speed pattern game. As Fraga often does, he takes a fun idea and distills it down into a very pure form.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This just isn't my type of game. I actually had quite a bit of fun playing it thanks to the company, but this would not be something I would play willingly in the future. There are three different modes of play for this game and I prefer the second one. The Ricochet Robots version I never need play again! Dexterity mixed with puzzling.

RATING: 8
Great components and insert (seriously, a game with marbles could be a nightmare, and it's anything but), simple rules, and some surprisingly tricky elements. I like that it combines a mental puzzle with dexterity, and does so in a different way than other dexterity games.

Okay with two, but seems like it would really shine with three or four.

I need a handicap against my kiddo (age 8), but that will likely change. I play with the "hold them all" variant for me; I probably also need to make my win condition more cards, or give her a free drop/round, or both.

Definitely better with three than two. Re-rated from a 7 to an 8 after we played it five times on the day it arrived. This one's a keeper!

Very fun, quick dexterity game.  I've really enjoyed my plays of this, and would say the only negative is that once a player begins to excel, it's tough for other players to keep up.  this isn't unusual with speed games, but it is a real problem since repeated plays become problematic.  We've come up with a few handicap ideas, but ultimately I think it's just a sign that this is a really cool mechanism with a slightly flawed game wrapped around it.  Still, fun to bring out and introduce to new players, even if my wife won't let me play anymore :)

Fun game with my kids, but not just a kids game. It's about half-dexterity, half-visualization, so a decent challenge for adults, too.

What?  Fun?  Why, yes indeed this is very fun.  A mad dexterity dash with spatial reasoning thrown in to spice the mix up.  I have been playing this with a few high schoolers... "Let's play Eureka," they say 5 minutes before class is out.  Has everyone been focussed today?  Yes.  Then "Yes" and I join in... spilled marbles, "Eureka!"... no oops... errr... "Got it!"... "Eureka... I beat you to it!"  Graduation is next week... I hope they remember the laughter in school and staying late on Friday for board games... and, yes, a few more rounds of Dr. Eureka.

This is a fantastic speed matching game with great components. Each player has three plastic test tubes and six marbles of three different colours. You will need to manipulate the test tubes and marbles to achieve the same pattern as the current card. 

Only four players from the box, but multiple sets can be combined. I've just got my second!

Slight warning - For younger uncoordinated players it can prove frustrating.

It's amazing how much fun can adults have with this silly game. Dexterity with eye-hand coordination and logical thinking, all while maintaining the stress of having to finish before everyone else does. 

Sure it is basically multiplayer solitaire, but interaction is present anyway in out-of-the-game forms, which is a very good thing for a game in my opinion!

I feel like I used to do these sort of puzzles as a kid. I don't normally like dexterity games, but I make an exception for this one because it's so simple, and an average game could last as "long" as 5 minutes. I only wish it supported more than 4 players. But, at $20 retail, it's easy enough to pick up two copies to support up to 8 if one wishes. Excellent way to start or end a game night.

I like this combination of logic and speed game with some dexterity thrown in, but it proved way too hard for my kids to play following the rules.  Pouring the balls from tube to tube without spilling was frustrating for them at speed, especially with the puzzle-solving aspect of figuring out the right order.  So 5 with my kids unless we just have fun with the logic part without worrying about the speed.

Not for me. Each round provides a race to see who can move balls from one test tube to another to satisfy the common contract in the middle, and the fastest gets the card to score a point. Repeat. Too many times. The fastest can often mean the player who started with their balls luckily closest to the order required for this round, but experience definitely helps as well, making it poor fare to pull out with families / non-gamers. It's easy enough to join in the fun whilst playing but I'd rather be ...

This one is great. Simply great. You get three test tubes, each one containing three sets of three marbles. So three green, three red, and three purple. Then a card is flipped over and shows a pattern: one test tube with a green marble in it, one with two red and a purple, and the last with two green, one red, and two purple, in that order. Then you figure out a way to "pour" marbles back and forth in your test tubes to complete that pattern. It's a speed game, so the first person to complete it grabs the card. Most cards wins. 

Very good logic/speed/pattern game. Has gone over very well with everyone I've played it with.

Seems the current thing in speed games is: solve the puzzle faster than anybody else. 

Dr. Eureka has two tricks up its sleeve - one is a (unique) dexterity element, the other is nonlinearity of it. It is really about figuring fast logistic answer to your situation, which has multiple paths of solution. If your dexterity skills are decent enough, deducing the proper path, fast, will be crucial. 

(This different to Panic Lab which is linear puzzle solving)

This is a great game!  It is a fun and fast paced game that is incredibly easy to pick up, learn, and start playing in minutes.  It requires a little dexterity, but not too much.  We have used it as an ice breaker game for game nights.

* We played the larger than life demo copy at Essen which I think was the worst way to try it out as the oversized tubes were a little more difficult to handle.

We played to 5 points which seemed a little too long for all of us. An interesting premise that seemed a little lacking in execution. A shame as I had really high hopes for this one.

Great family game, everyone can play this.
Stress levels may raise while playing this game.
Does not take long, great for a filler as well to get your juices flowing.
We do  not allow inverting your tubes to match the required formulas.

I will play this whenever somebody asks.  It's may be one of my favorite dexterity games.  It's quick, SUPER easy to teach and gets people laughing!  Near perfection.

When the rules and premise were explained to me, I thought the game was doomed to be terrible. Boy was I wrong. So fun! I may be overstating my enthusiasm, but time will tell. I feel confident that this is a family game worth owning, even if you don't have kids (and especially if you're looking for something whacky to play with a few adult beverages in the mix).

The basic premise is simple. Each player has three test tubes, each with two colored marbles inside. A card if flipped over in the center of the table that depicts a particular pattern of colored marbles. Then it's a race to see who can match their test tubes to the picture on the card. But if you spill any of your marbles, you're out for the round. It combines dexterity with visual puzzle solving, with the added pressure of racing to beat everyone else to the finish line. What's more, you can easily handicap older/more experienced players by imposing a more difficult set of restrictions on them (e.g., requiring them to hold all three test tubes in hand while shuffling the balls around). From a simple premise comes a brilliant game.

This game is super simple.  You have 3 test tubes and 6 balls in 3 different colors.  Someone flips over a card that shows an arrangement of the 6 balls in the 3 test tubes, then players race to recreate the picture on the card.  But, you can't touch the balls with your hands and you can't just leave the balls on the table.

So on the one hand it feels like the classic puzzle where you are trying to cross a river with one boat and you have to shuttle people back and forth in a certain sequence otherwise the wolf will eat the sheep or whatever.  Then, once you have figured out the puzzle, you have to actually transfer the balls between the test tubes (which can be very difficult).  All-in-all, it was a great filler for about 10 or 15 minutes until we were ready to play the real games.

This game's actually not bad, but it has an issue that a lot of speed games have: if one player is better than the others, it can be a frustrating experience.

Have a brain? Have steady hands? Ready to challenge both @ once??? If yes to both, this is a GREAT filler. The speed element is beautifullly complimented by the forced finesse required to move the balls between the test tubes.

It is was it is.  I ranked it a 6 because it is so fast and easy to teach,  and it can be fun at the right time, for some dexterity challenges.  Agree with few post, that an extra color and another tube per person could add some more challenge and make it a bit more strategic.  Or add a shape to one of the two same colors, and make those the first on the cards per color going left to right.   Also disallow the flip over rule, all test tubes have to be right side up.

Such a quick, quirky, original, dexterity game. I love it. Transport marbles between test tubes using only the tubes. You can't drop them or touch the marbles with your hands. I truly love this game.

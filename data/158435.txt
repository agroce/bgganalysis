Best cutthroat area control game. The loosely alliances are so deep, it could be easily rethemed into Game of Thrones. 
It has very elegant gameplay based on cards, nice artwork and overproduced components. The game's box is bigger than necessary.

The gameplay is surprisingly intuitive. It's a sort of abrstract majority influence / stockholding game. Don't believe the worker placement garbage tag on BGG. There is no action drafting at all. 

I have some worries about the balance. I'm not sold that players have a wide enough berth of decision making space. I felt like the core gameplay was borderline too shallow. but I had fun, and would like to test the waters again.

Also, don't worry about missing the Kickstarter exclusive factions if you pick this up retail. They are pretty awful IMO. Two of Kickstarter factions are laughably bad compared to the base 5. It seemed like the game was designed around five factions and threw in some extras with no real playtesting or balance because, stretch goals.

RATING: 3
Basically a pure negotiation game, where packs are made by setting a player's captain(s) on the same side or opposing side of other player's captain(s). Each player has a special advantage. The advantages are different and some are clearly stronger than others. The game doesn't have a build-in catch up mechanism, so if the players won't balance the game, nothing will. There is a big risk of losing the game after losing the first couple battles.

RATING: 6
Reminds me a bit of that gaming classic Cosmic Encounter with card-based battles in a multi-player context that assumes that the balance in the game will come from ever-changing alliances.  Card play on your side: bam!  Take that!  And everybody bash the leader, or you will lose, unless of course, you happen to randomly draw a wickedly powerful card at just the right moment that saves you big time. 

If this sounds like a fun way to game, you might like Dogs of War.  For me, for better or worse, this is just not the type of game that I am interesting in playing at this point.

Dogs of War is, simply put, a magnificent game. It's very rules-simple and plays in just over an hour, but it is absolutely jam-packed with the kind of decisions that will tear your brain in two. The game pits the players, as mercenary captains in fabulous hats, against each other as they support various houses in their ongoing wars. Exactly which house you support at any given time is less important, however, than which rewards you can claim and which opposing captains you can defeat for prestige. Battles play out like little tug-of-wars (tugs-of-war?), with each captain that is committed to a side swaying the result slightly in their favour. Each round is a tense bout of negotiation, opportunism, alliances made and broken, glorious victories and crushing defeats. And then at the game end the house victories actually do matter! Since you've been collecting their tokens this whole time and they're worth an amount of points (even negative points!) that depends on how the house fared! Oh, it's so, so good.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
I liked this game more than I thought I would.  Actually I had never heard of this before Stew told us he got a copy.  The game does offer some interesting decisions, and plays pretty quickly.  The mini's for the game were also super nice.  Not exactly sure how many races their were, but there was a sit of nice mini's for all of them.  Some of the special abilities did seem more powerful than others, so probably best to draft races vs randomly distributing them (as we did).  This one surprised me, and I would like to try it again.

I really like this game a lot. I've had one negative playthrough of this game, and that was due to the playgroup and not this magnificent game. This game is what Hobbes was referring to when he spoke of life outside society, because it damn sure is nasty, brutish, and (surprisingly) short. I always find myself eager to play this one, even though I have yet to win. This game is so good it may have replaced Revolution! for me; which was the game that got me fully into this hobby and was my favorite game for a very long time. If my house was on fire, this game and Fleet would be the two I save immediately.

This was an impulse buy after seeing it at a bargain price on Ebay. Only played one game so far but it's already top of my "want to play again" meter. The game is mechanically simple and fairly short (~1hr) but provides great player interaction, tense decisions and lots of fun. I was surprised how well it worked with the boys - I expected the game to be too cut-throat for them. However, the spite-levels are really just a reflection of the people playing. Since the alliances and betrayals are evenly mixed, no-one really feels picked on for long. This game should be easy to get to the table frequently. Excellent game!

Actually a good game that did not work with our group (whose members are notoriously terrible at negotiation and who tend to shy away from confrontation). This also does not play well at all with 3: I would recommend 4 players minimum, and 5 players would be ideal. 

Otherwise, I think the design is great. The scoring is very interesting, in that it operates almost like a stock game: players want to rally behind early winners before the tokens of that faction run out. I love the placement bonuses, which have a huge impact on your decision to help or hurt someone else, and the special abilities really force you to change the way you play. Components are top-notch (even though the Kickstarter soldier minis are totally unnecessary), and the extra KS characters are awesome!

RATING: 7
What we have here is an incredibly straightforward, rules-light game that is really just a vehicle for tons of player interaction. The game is structured such that it is quite likely players will form small alliances in the early game, only to become bitter enemies toward the end.

There isn't really [i]intrigue[/i] as such - there's no "betrayal" in the sense that players decide to backstab each other. It's just that people get paired up differently from round to round and the result is a natural change in the social dynamics. This might make it a good choice for people who don't take well to being betrayed or ganged up on, etc.

As for me, I think it's pretty clever. I enjoy the game. I don't get the same emotional fulfillment as I do in games where I actually get to cajole someone into trusting me only to show them just [i]how very[/i] wrong they were to do so at the first available opportunity, but I've already got a ton of games for just that purpose.

In summary: rules-light, good playtime, tons of interaction, loads of drama/excitement, fun options, and a randomized board for replayability. A keeper!

Bizarrely themed, abstract which didn't appeal to me. Players' special abilities range from 'ridiculously useful' (pink) to 'no use whatsoever' (grey) and the game has the problem of the rich getting richer with no way for back-markers to catch up. If you don't win coins early in the game you'll be stuck playing the rather feeble footmen in later battles which won't win you anything worthwhile and don't really affect the outcome.

I was pleasantly surprised by this game. I had never even heard of it before a fellow gamer brought it to the table. It seemed very easy to pick up on and have a nice competitive game from the start. The decision making can cause a little AP because each decision makes a huge impact, but the game is rather simple with its gameplay. Probably my favorite part of the game was the semi-coop feel the game has, where a player chooses what side to jump on in the war, and that's where allies and enemies are made. The components to the game seemed top notch, I was very impressed. I played a 5 player game and it worked out great. It was cutthroat with lots of blocking and backstabbing! Definitely a game I wouldn't mind playing more!

Dogs of War is a game that one of our gamers in our weekly group specifically picked up to have a five player option that everyone would enjoy and that was reasonably playable in a weekly evening. Bingo!

I was interested in trying this, as I really like both Libertalia and Augustus from the same designer.

Dogs of War is a combination of worker placement, "tug of war" area control and stocks. Sounds weird, but in execution it's a pretty slick design. The game lasts only four rounds, and each round resets substantially, requiring players to reassess which of six "houses" they want to back and support with their armies.

Solid game, and the minis are both odd and freaking cool. Not sure if I need to pick up a copy because we already have one within our group, but I look forward to playing this again.

Every single choice in this game matters.  Do I go for the free upgrade, or stand with someone who already did for a higher chance at points.  Do I spend my entire turn trying to upset a battle, or do I come in under the radar supporting the right houses.  Had a wonderful time with this, strongly recommend exactly 5 players.

Kickstarted.  Included Extra $8 addon captain.

Saw at Gencon, looked great.  Minis were awesome, board and cards looked good.  KS version comes with a ton of extras.

Play is tense and battles can change quickly.  Cards are valuable and can definitely provide an advantage.  My group liked that money was used only for buying armies and not a ton of stuff.  It is important to manage your resources.

After repeated plays it looks like experience helps you win, but winning battles every time is not necessary to ensure victory.

What makes it great is that even though we are at each other's throats all game, on a board that gets tighter each round with more captains, you never get mad at each other. It never felt like an aggressive, "take that" experience. That's because even if you are against someone on one battle, you are fighting side-by-side somewhere else. Their attack against you might just be what makes it clear to abandon that field and jump onto a winning side with another family. I loved how many battles stayed tight until the end, with surprise tactics card play to swing the tide.
I really loved this game. The rules are minimal, but the decisions are bountiful and satisfying.

Although played differently, I find the theme to be similar to A Game of Thrones.
Keep everything secret, no one knows who you will back, what side you may be going for, or what you have up your sleeves.
Had a 5 player game, and everyone who played it had a really good time, on edge every round, especially the last round.
By the end of the game, when we were counting up points, we still didn't know who was going to take the lead until it was all counted up and had a winner.

Great game!

Rating would go up at least 1 point if I could convince my group to ignore the stupid rule that creates hidden trackable information. But the bigger problem is the lopsided nature of the factions once they start to get ahead. It's a tipping point that is reached too soon. Factions that are behind don't catch up because there's not enough incentive for players to back it, and it's nigh unto impossible to win a battle on your own.

LOVE tug of war. No dice. Just player on player bidding and variable and rich economic decisions. One fantastic mechanic is the growing value of victory chips of a given house based on their performance during the game (starting at a deficit). 

Short (relatively). Variable player powers. Immense depth and meaningful decision making weighing many conditions.

Love. This. Game.

I think this game would've been better with a much lower price point without the fancy pointless miniatures.
This would've been a perfect 30$ game, but it retails for almost twice as much. For it's price point, there are much better games out there.

Plays well only with 4 or 5 players and it's medium length (1 hour game). This results in the game not being long enough to be the "main course" of a gaming evening/day, yet is a tad too thinky and long to be a filler.

... and the theme is completely pasted-on.

However, when all is said and done, this isn't a bad game by itself. I'd still play it and have fun.

Sort of a longer, more meaty version of Biblios. 
Waaay overproduced. Would be much more appropriate with wooden pawns instead of the plastic minis. Pure Eurogame. There's no theme here, folks. Not that that matters as far as the game goes, but the minis don't contribute anything but make it look like a toy and add to the cost, no doubt.

After a single play, this is the game for me. I love it. The opposite of the MP solitaire norm in worker placement euros, DoW forces you not only to pay attention - lots of attention - to the interests of your opponents, but also to choose whether to confront or support them.  

In many great games you have to figure out what your opponent wants so you can take it from them. DoW takes this yomi and double-think to another level - you figure out what your opponent wants so you can GIVE it to them. In this way you put yourself on the winning side of more battles, furthering your long-term interests, and winning the war.

Brilliant, inspired game design.

The playing pieces you get in the KS edition are amazing. Everything else is of good quality as well. 

I liked the game, but some characters felt clearly better than others. I guess you could and should adapt you play style to suit your character but Sir Perceval for example will never be good.

Quite quick playing time as well which is a plus. The game never drags. Probably better with five than with four despite not having tried it.

[b]OPINIÓN PERSONAL:[/b]
El Dogs of War me parece un claro ejemplo de "joya en el barro", uno de esos juegos excelentes que -sin saber muy bien por qué- han pasado completamente desapercibidos. Y en este caso es aún más inexplicable, pues es de una compañía muy grande (CoolMiniOrNot) y tiene una estética y unas miniaturas sobresalientes.

Desde luego tiene todo lo que hace falta para triunfar en mi grupo de juego... para empezar enfrenta a los jugadores entre sí, pero no de una manera directa y burda, sino a través de las guerras entre casas. Cada uno deberá decidir a qué casas apoyar, y deberá hacerlo sin llamar excesivamente la atención: si se nota demasiado que estás apostando por cierta casa, y dicha casa empieza a ir muy bien, lo más seguro es que el resto de jugadores se pongan en tu contra.

Eso te obliga a racionar tus escasas tropas con mucho cuidado, jugando en varios frentes a la vez para no quedar vendido si al final pierdes en alguno de ellos, y procurando que no se noten tus verdaderas intenciones hasta que sea demasiado tarde para combatirte. Por supuesto, también están a la orden del día las alianzas y las traiciones, pudiendo incluso cambiar de bando en mitad de una batalla.

Aparte de lo ya comentado, me gustaría mencionar que los enfrentamientos se resuelven sin apenas azar, dependiendo únicamente de las tropas y cartas/habilidades que utilice cada jugador. Eso sí, no se puede decir que el juego en su conjunto tenga cero azar, pues hay un par de detalles que le dan un punto de aleatoriedad... pero es azar del bueno. Aquí no vas a la batalla y cuando ya estás allí te encuentras con que pierdes por sacar varios unos, sino que algunos de tus recursos te los dan al azar (las cartas de táctica) y tú tienes que intentar sacarles el máximo provecho utilizando tu ingenio para jugarlos en el momento justo.

En definitiva, es un juego muy intenso y de duración comedida (unos 90 minutos), con varios mecanismos para aumentar su rejugabilidad (aparte de que te impulsa a jugar la revancha, está el hecho de que cada jugador elige uno de los cinco generales disponibles al principio de la partida, y cada uno de ellos tiene una habilidad distinta que los define... es normal querer ir cambiando para probarlas todas).

This was a surprising title for me. I went in not expecting too much but it turned out to be quite a little gem of a game. The only downfall is the overproduction because there's a disconnect between price and game. Production looks like a $60 game, but gameplay feels like a $35-40 game. Which is the shame because the MSRP is going to keep people away.

RATING: 5.5
Interesting worker placement-stock market sort of game where the theme is completely irrelevant. There are six great houses vying for power and you can choose to support some all or non and at the end of the game they are worth varying victory point values.

There are three tug of war type 'battles' per turn where there is a worker placement aspect with each side of the battle having up to six places with an ability.

The minis are nice but they are a little large for the board, which was clearly designed for cards.

It is a real shame that this is so under appreciated, as I think that it is an absolute gem.  It has almost everything that I look for in a game: player interaction, hard decisions to make, strategy and most of all, fun.  Production values are incredible as well, as you would expect for a CoolMiniorNot game.  Still, as it is not well know, it means that it can be picked up cheap and I would recommend that you do.

My favorite Euro hands down.  My whole family and all my friends will play it (where other war themed games might not go over well).  Many strategies can work.  Awesome player interaction, intrigue and changing of allies.  My favorite mechanic in a game: "tug of war" where players decide which side of the 3 battles to add their strength.  
My personal #1 game of all time.  I can't believe it's not more popular.

I like the concept of this game but there are just a lot of things that irk me about it.

Played it twice now and the powers are not balanced. We will probably play without them next time if it comes out again. The combat zone card are cool and but sometimes the random way they come out along with the family cards, really can screw you.

Finally the crushing victory element doesn't happen often and it seems too hard to push a family up. They all start so low and it would take an incredible series of circumstances for a family to get to be worth 5-7 points. I almost wish it used more of an imperial 2030 method where the game doesn't end until one family reaches the top but then the game would take way too long.

I want to like the game but there are just so many elements that seem off to me

Initial rating a 9.  Can see it going higher. Yeah moved to a 10.  Just an amazing game

Just an excellent quick game with lots of potential for negotiation and not knowing who is going to win till the end.

Simple to learn and teach, but with depth in the strategy you take.

This game does an amazing job of presenting the player with many simultaneous factors that shape your decision, without being a math-fest. Do I support a house, or go for a reward? Which house, which reward? Do I save up for next round or go all in now? 
This game also has provided some fantastic moments of inter-player negotiation. And I personally loooove the (over) production and art. Pushing around cubes just is not the same a plopping down a fancy-hatted captain.
This would be a 10 except for a few things:
Really needs 5 players.
First round can be kind of blah.
(Both of these are the same complaint - you need to have a crowded battlefield to make it interesting)

Ok right now it's an 8. I love the tension/stress this game causes without the drawn out trading/negotiation periods that games like Catan or something create. Plus you get a little worker placement/engine building action too. The theme did nothing for me but the miniatures are unique enough to still make the board fun to look at (something super important to me). I got this as a replacement for City of Horror, a game that is phenomenal at creating stress but made me feel like a bad person every time I played (lying/manipulating people to think they were making the best choice for themselves when it was actually the best choice for me). It works perfect for that - essentially doing the same thing, which is fun in the right amount, but to a lesser degree. It's more like a stock game with hidden info than a pure negotiation game. Low rules overhead for a very complex game. Next time I play, I want to try it with one less round and bump the house starting positions to 0.

Cons: The negotiation aspects have been exaggerated, and like many worker-placement games the possibility for AP is very high.
Pros: Very pretty, very clean, but with lots of moving parts nonetheless. The shifting board setup alone guarantees a lot of variability. The various resources--cash, cards, influence, captains, soldiers--all interact in lots of interesting ways for you to leverage.

All in all, definitely an upper tier worker-placement game.

Basically Blood Bowl Team Manager, without the incredible amount of luck.
Very tight design & has a great playtime duration (without ap players). Also since all battles/tricks have an impact on you, everyone is involved continiously.

Slightly overproduced components, but a fun, if abstracted game of mercenary captains. There is room for bluffing and treacherous plays, and oppertunism is rewarded.


I can see influences on this game from Lancaster, Perikles, Princes of the Renaissance etc. And that's a good thing.

RATING: 6
It's not bad. It's kinda like an auction game, kinda like an area control game, kinda like a worker placement.

Worker placement in that you get an action for every worker you place - you want to be going first so that you have access to the prime action spaces

Auction - in as much as you are bidding as teams to win the battle

Area control - in as much as it's the player with the most bids (not the highest total spend) on the winning side that takes the bonus reward, so you want to be going last in the turn

Extra captains are awesome so that you can take the first and last turn in a round, but then it's easy to run out of soldiers... extra soldiers is a redundant investment unless you have (or anticipate getting) extra captains... the card that allows you to skip a turn is also awesome for this same reason

Best with 4, can't imagine it works well with 3 or 5

Notes after one game.

Short version: a light, easy, fun game, but man, it is complicated to explain.

Longer version: combines easy turns with lots of thinking and some tension. Good fun, but a bit long for what it is.

I went into the game thinking that it would have something of The King is Dead or Imperial about the way the players support houses that they do not own. There is a little of this, but - rather disappointingly, I think - it is not central to the game. 

The reason is that no house can ever win more than 4 battles - which in itself is unlikely. If none of them are Glorious Victories then the influence you have collected in that house is only multiplied by 3. Winning the game just by collecting enough influence in a house while engineering 4 won battles is a far more difficult task than to win by collecting sufficient victory points, money and tactics cards. Influence is merely one of the various ways to scrape together points - it is not at all the mainstay of the game.

Another lesson learned the hard way: you must absolutely ensure that some of the loot you take from the battles is money. Without money in your pocket by the end of the year you are crippled for the rest of the game.

I liked the game, but I hate the box. It is at least twice as big as it need be, and that's being generous. The air:bits ratio isn't as bad as Splendor, but it's pretty awful. I hate oversized boxes because I have a severe constraint on space, so that means that the box will be chucked out and the bits and the board will go to share the box of some other game.

The publisher’s theming of this essentially abstract game is pretty strange. I interpreted the blurb "an elegant game set in a steampunk-influenced renaissance universe" as meaning something like 51st State or Neuroshima Hex, but flavoured by the 15th century. Instead, it's a child of wild imaginings of someone who's been smoking the carpet. Fantastic figurines, lots of puffy velvet, stupid hats, nothing remotely steampunk about any of it - except the art in the rulebook, which is completely out of keeping with the minis.

Don’t expect a war game or anything like it. This is an abstract euro with the word “war” in the title and some odd warlike references in the board and components to lay a translucent film gingerly over it. I have nothing against abstracts, but anyone who buys it looking for a war-game will be disappointed.

The publisher’s choices of nomenclature is strange too. For example, the “first, second and third” battles make it sound as if there’s a sequence to them, when they could have been called “west, central and east” or something. The “Order of Battle” is bizarre. Those cards represent loot, and it would be far more obvious what is going on if they were simply labelled “Loot”.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Twas a bit soiled on first sight due to the teacher giving quite a bit of advice that to people that also helped him quite a bit. I tried to stem the tide to a degree but to limited avail. This game likely shines once everyone knows how to play and doesn't need advice as table talk and negotiations can be either ignored or countered more easily. Make sure to take money in the early going, it is more important than anything else as income is extremely limited. Minis are over the top as probably should be expected from CoolMiniOrNot. Be aware that this is a nasty game where you are placing workers to not only get stuff but also support a noble and hopefully win the battle to score points, etc. I don't think I would ever play this with 3 without the variant of removing a battle. Five is likely best. 

===============================

I would play this if asked. I sold my copy due to difficulty getting it to the table.

In seinem Zug setzt man Figuren in eine von drei Kriegen ein und unterstützt mit einer ausgespielten Handkarte eine der beiden Seiten des Krieges. Dafür bekommt man Bonis wie Geld oder neue Handkarten, etc. die einem wiederrum über die nächste Runde bringen.
Am Ende erhält man Siegpunkte für Wappen die man gesammelt, je nachdem wie gut das Haus nach 4 Runden Krieg da steht sind diese mehr wert.
Das Spiel hat mir ganz gut gefallen, war jetzt aber nicht der Überflieger. Meine Spezialfähigkeit hat kaum getriggert und wenn mal doch hatte ich sie auch total vergessen.
Gefühlt kam es mir auch so vor, dass ich die erste Runde verbockt hatte und dann kaum noch aufholen konnte, weil kein Geld, somit keine Söldner und damit auch keine gewonnenen Kriege -> keine SP... Hat ja aber doch noch geklappt ;)

I honestly KS'd this one based on the designer and the one play through I saw. I had no certainty that I'd love this game, but I'm glad I got it, because I think it's quite good.

The play is fairly straight forward, combining tug of war games like Battline or Blood Bowl: Team Manager with the token collection and valuation of those tokens a-la Princes of the Renaissance. So there are 3 battles each round, worker placement which collects you cards, points, and tokens, and the result of each battle increases the value of the house whose side won, and ergo the value of the tokens increases.

My god are the decisions difficult. There's almost always 3 things you want to do at the same time, and ordering them is difficult and often gives something good away to another player. I find that a good thing as no one player can lock down all the good choices for themselves. There's also the matter of the captain you choose, or Dog of War, which has a special power and drives each players strategy a bit.

The game is WAY overproduced, but I love it for that as well.

A surprisingly good game.  Components are very nice and overproduced for the game play.  However, the game is not that expensive.  The game is played in four years where there are three battles.  You get benefits for placing captains on order of battle cards.   You get victory points and bonuses if you are on the winning side.  Each color has its own advantage.  I did not think I would like the game but it was excellent.  It had elements of Sun Tzu and other games with area majority that I like.  

Medium to light weight with a surprising amount of strategy.

Dogs of War is a nice tactical game what mixes majority and combat with cards with strategic house support. There seem to be some kind of issue as not all houses will get initial support and may cause balance issues throughout the game, same with the player order as not all players start/end a round in a 3 and 5 player game, which can be a big advantage or disadvantage.

Love this game - Much underated game

play over 4 turns each represents a year - Each year 6 Houses fight in three battles - Buy your soldiers and then place then on one side of a battle to win influence with that house and gain bonuses when placing soldiers - tactic cards add a little extra and each player has a unique special ability. Need to play this a few more times but its fairly simple and good fun - recommend 4 or 5 playes

RATING: 6
UPDATE: Downrated from 8 to 6.  While this game has many tight rules, the sad thing about the game is lack of variety outside of the character powers.  Every game feels the same where you are focused on getting one or two things per year (money, army, shields, etc) and that changes the next year.  If I wanted the same experience but with lots of replayability, Sons of Anarchy has done a far better job with each game having different areas and benefits to exploit instead of the same "get two shields" that Dogs of War has.


This game is backstabbing, manipulation, diplomacy, and subterfuge from beginning to end.  It is a worker placement game that, for once, has loads of player interactivity.  Very easy to teach with excessive component quality and doesn’t overstay it’s welcome.

However, the game doesn’t have expansions available at retail and it doesn’t scale well with 3 players.  4 players is acceptable, but I feel the full experience requires 5 players.  With the lack of expansions, I have a feeling that over time this game could get stale, since a good portion of the replay value is the powers each player has.  I still highly recommend checking out the game though.

A game that creates a dilemma: it's one of those that I seem to like more than my play group. It's a mean game, much more so than most euro games, and requires a bit of negotiation to play well. 

I enjoyed my first play quite a bit, though I fear it could get a bit samey. More card or special power variety would have helped.

And this is why I think this is the game where people can rightfully bitch that people who didn't back it on Kickstarter got a raw deal. There's a vocal minority that complains about Blood Rage, in that you don't get a couple of Monsters if you didn't back the game on Kickstarter. But those monsters are like 2% of the game - you're still getting 98% of the game. But with Dogs of War, Kickstarter backers got 80% more starting characters and 50% more cards! They literally got a much more varied game. Now, I can understand why they didn't put the extra characters in the base set - all those nice captain minis would have cost a lot of money, and it might have been hard to fit them in the box. But the cards? It would have cost about 25 cents, and it would have given more variety to the game. That was a missed opportunity. Now you see a bunch of people on BGG hopelessly trying to scrounge up the KS stuff. A shame.

Update: raised my rating to an 8. While I'm still annoyed about how much of the game is left out of the non-KS game, I've found to my surprise that this one gets better with time. Almost every game I play gets a bit more stale and samey with each repeated play, but because Dogs is so player dependent, new things keep opening up that I've never seen before.

Two caveats: a player dependent negotiation game is inherently a bit fragile, in that your mileage will definitely vary with different groups. Also, this game is mean to the point where if you can't deal with screaming, cursing, and someone silently sobbing in the corner, this game might not be for you.

To start let me just say that the Cool Mini Or Not production of the game is just spectacular... the game board is beautiful and functional, the rulebook is great with a LOT of story about the World, the Characters and the Houses fighting each other... and the minis!!! Oh the MINIS!!!
The only thing that seems completely out of place are those plastic battle trackers, I don't know if they could have find anything uglier than that even if they had tried!

The game flows really well and it plays very fast... some tough decisions to be made, as it should be, but the downtime is not an issue. The game is at the same time strategical because you can layout a plan but it's also very tactical because you have to adapt to what the other players do and what spots they occupy in each battle!

Also, the rules are pretty straight forward and easy to teach and understand, I can see this game being played in under 1 hour, maybe even with 5 players!

I think this is one of the most underestimated and overlooked games of 2014, it's worthy of much more love than what it got.

Fun enough game, but doesn't do much to set itself apart from many other games out there, mechanically-speaking. This is basically a game where you are backing different houses that are warring against each other. You receive support from backing houses, and the houses rise and fall in prestige as the game goes along. I couldn't help but compare this game to Asgard and Founding Fathers, two games I enjoy greatly. Both have great mechanisms based around backing one side or the other in a conflict, and I believe both do it better than what is done here. This just has a lot of extra chrome involved with choosing rewards, having secret goals, etc. It isn't a bad game, but I'm not sure why this needed to exist when those games already do.

I must admit that the game is awesome! I laughed so hard when I first saw the minis, they were fun and somewhat special in comparison to other games'. The artwork of both the rule book and the map are impressive, I have never enjoyed reading the rule books this much. It's a pity that I'm not capable of coloring the minis :(

The gameplay is absolutely its best aspect. The economy is tough, you have to calculate very carefully for the following rounds, alliance is made and disbanded almost every single turn; all of the above will make you stay at the edge of your seat for the whole game time.

Deffy worth trying once!

Great production quality (except the cards), maybe a bit overdone at times, especially with some minis (like Lady Macbeth).

The game is a "Blood Bowl: Team Manager" where several "managers" can participate in each side, and there are several rewards participants will choose from. And overall, the feeling is pretty much the same. Very little control of what happens in the game, very powerful cards that will thwart whatever small tactical plans you can improvise, and everything will be decided in the last turn. 

And that makes me think... Why do we have to play over the boring first turns? Why can't we skip directly to the fun part? 

The last turn is even more chaotic. Everybody will have saved their best cards (yes, that's you, treachery cards) and you will find yourself at the mercy of events you can’t control.

Players have special powers (optional rule), but they are quite unbalanced. 

On a side note, this a game for 5 players, it loses a lot with less than 5.

I think there’s too much KS hype in this game. It’s not bad, but it could have been better.

After first play: 
I thought this was a typical war-game, but is rather more about area control. Are control games usually don't like me even when I like them, but this was fair to me. 

It plays well and balanced, but it's a bit repetitive: You do exactly the same things four times. You could play it with three or five rounds with no difference in playability. There is no build up, or progress between the rounds.

Based on one play: A simple game where houses battle each other and you play your support to one side or another in hopes of getting points for that houses successes at the end of the game. You can support any house and others can join you or go against you, support the opposing house. The house that wins moves up in the point track and at the end you get those points multiplied by the number of crests you have. Very interactive, yet fairly simple but I found myself wishing there was a little more to it.

Best with 5 players. Simple but beautiful game mechanic. High quality components. Very little downtime - many options and different paths to victory, backstabbing, much communication and conflict between the players, but no bad feelings because the enemy can be your partner in another battle.
Just by watching the gameplay video I had no idea that the game plays so well and is so good.
But I would not recommend it for less than four.

In this game you play different factions who invest in the conflicts of these 6 houses, and all you want to do is get VP, it's not important which side wins. The whole game is push your luck, where you invest soldiers and pawns in one side or the other of this conflict, and at the end, the winning side gets points based on how many player pawns opposed them. It's one of those wonderful games with simple rules but complex choices. Each player also gets a very easy to understand special ability that changes the way they play the game dramatically. The meeple pawns are completely nuts looking with by far the best hats I've ever seen in a board game component.

A tense tactical negotiation game. Money is tight, which leads to scarcity in power and having to rely on other players for assistance. The game is simple, yet there are many different rewarding play styles. It can be fun to snatch up straight victory points on the order of battle cards or collect influence tokens for end game scoring, but sometimes it's a smarter move to forfeit a round and save up for a power play in the future. It's always fun watching someone intimidate other players with a well placed War Machine. It's even more fun to watch everyone rise up and steal victory from the jaws of defeat. Dogs of War is definitely more clever than it first appears. Could become a favorite with more plays.

This was a game which I considered backing on kickstarter on 2014, but decided ultimately not to. But one of our gaming friends actually bought a retail copy, so we actually got to play this, in March 2015. And I enjoyed it, enough to look forward to future plays (which I initially thought would probably happen as the others seemed to enjoy it too - but that still hasn't happened as of January 2016). It's actually a really simple game in essence, but has plenty to consider and a very welcome element of trying to read the intentions of other players (and even to openly discuss them and make agreements if you feel like it). I could see this rating potentially increasing with more plays, but for now I stay at 7 as I would say that I merely "like" the game, rather than being very excited to play again.

I think this may be my first worker placement game. The game is beautiful, but way overproduced. The very cool miniatures could've just as well been pawns or wooden blocks - the game would've had a much smaller footprint both on the table and on the shelves then.

Players are the leaders of mercenary companies, who are supporting six different noble houses in their struggle for supremacy over the fictional kingdom of Gravos. During four different rounds, players will take turns in placing one of their captains - together with a soldier card (of varying strength) in support of one of the houses and get the reward printed on their space in return. That way, players try to build up as high a score as possible, to win the game after round four.

The rules are quite easy to grasp, though we often play a practice round to get a feel for them the first time. There are many different viable strategies, as there are quite a few ways of scoring points (gathering money and cards, gathering influence with succesful houses, gathering victory points directly from the board,...) and even room for negotiating with your fellow players to support one house or the other. Long story short: there's a lot of strategic depth behind a relatively simple game engine here.

Not bad. Kind of missing the Game of Thrones theme and licensing - with some tweaks it'd make another fine Game of Thrones game. I like that the board is forever changing. There's some good tense tussles between players, with bluffing and the ever present trade off of going for a reward you want or going for an area you want. All the scoring seems nicely balanced. It all come in at around 90 minutes with rules. Plays well with five players.

Matching the colours of the house cards and house value can be difficult without some dedicated side by side comparison. More than once I've mixed them up and invested in the wrong shields or pushed back a different side than I was intending. The red is easy, but after that it devolves into a murky mixture of blacks, blues and browns.

I got this for Christmas and it did NOT disappoint.  I would even say it is the best game (of 24) games I have gotten this year.  This game is like Dragon's gold with the complexity tripled. It feels like you are in the treaturous world of "Game of Thrones".  The only two warnings I would give iabout this is a game for serious gamers as the plays that can be made are MEAN.  The other warning is I don't believe the characters are balanced, but I think they could be made more balanced by starting some of the weaker characters out with more startup money.  Anyways I cannot recommend this game more, as a game designer myself this is one of those games that make me jealous.  Finally I hope they make an expansion.

Played once with 4P. Despite the intimidating size of its box, Dogs of War is a fairly straightforward game which features three simultaneous tugs-of-war occurring every round. Players compete to tip battles in favour of houses they are rooting for. To do this, they need to stock up on firepower by earning more money or cards via actions on the board, as well as allying with opponents who are invested in the same house.

It is therefore vital to roughly know your opponents' allegiances and strength of their soldiers in order to avoid entering battles where you will be hopelessly outmatched. However, this is a little problematic in practice. I found keeping track of all that information cumbersome after a while, while another player group had bouts of AP figuring out the best move. That is a drawback not easily solved by removing hidden information either, so Dogs of War requires a fast-and-loose approach to optimise the experience. 

As a final note, I found the incoherent visual presentation rather distracting. I normally don't mind overproduction in games, but the end result here was garish and grotesque; definitely not something the publisher was aiming for (I hope).

2015: 7. May upgrade, need some more games of this.  Feels like there's a lot of "follow the leader" syndrome going on, and the game quickly fell in this "conflict-less" game where people weren't opposing each other on the field.  I think we need to play it again.

2016: 7. Sold. Couldn't get it to the table again, too much competition.  Would certainly love to play it again though.

Not sure where all the negotiation and meanness that the other reviews mentioned are supposed to come from, but this game was pretty tame in that regard.

People just took their turns, there might have been some protesting and maybe some alliances, but not a whole lot. There is too much information that you need to keep secret and negotiation usually revealed too much about your strategy to be worth it.

That being said, I don't think that is a negative. The game was still really tense, not overly thinky, and a lot of fun. I can see this game getting much deeper the more I play it.

Only bad thing about it is that the theme is pretty pasted on and unintuitive.

Otherwise, it's a hit!

Attractive and grandiose. Stunning artwork and fancy minis draw you into its backstory - even if not born out in the mechanics.

Dogs of war is a sophisticated version of Great wall of china.  The game has a simplistic design but has very steam punk viewed characters.

Very enjoyable. Had elements of Bloodbowl Team Manager, but smoother and less clunky. At first it seems that some of the powers are imbalanced, but it levels off once players become aware of their power effect. Very enjoyable 90 minute game.

Pleasantly surprising! I love how the multiple battles mean your allegiances are always temporary, and you can be allied with someone at the same moment you're bitterly fighting them elsewhere.

Initial impressions are good. The production is excellent and I like this type of gameplay: play cards on either side of a battle to influence which side wins, similar to Blood Bowl Team Manager.

My only concern so far is is that the factions may not be balanced. One of them, for example, only gets a bonus if his side wins in a total victory (I forget the actual term used in the game) and that can be very hard to do, and is easy for other players to screw up. I need to play more to see how my feeling about this changes as well as my feeling about the game in general.

Update: Like most CMON games, this one just feels like it's missing something and was possibly underdeveloped. I like the idea of the assymetric characters and the shifting alliances but the game just wasn't very fun.

Sold.

A perfectly decent game, it feels like a very simple combination of Princes of Renaissance and Smash Up/Blood Bowl Team Manager?

You're basically going through 4 rounds of trying to swing wars between 6 different houses in such a way that the houses you have a vested interest in fare better.

There's a very limited number of unit types and tactics cards so you can generally have a very good grasp of the "state of the game" without a ton of experience which is nice for this type of game.

There are some ludicrously over produced minis in the game which is nice if completely over indulgent.  

It's a fun accessible game in this genre and if you can get it for the rock bottom price it has been going for then you have a winner.

Need another play or two, but my initial impression is meh. The mini's are incredible, but they are so large that they tend to crap up the board, making it hard to see. I couldn't really connect with the negotiation aspect of the game. Maybe it's the gross manipulation that's required to make your strategy to work that I don't like. The faction powers seemed a little overpowering and imbalancing at times. I'd rather play a game like Blood Bowl Team Manager which has similar aspects, more depth, and thematically more interesting.

A solid design and a beautiful aesthetic, just lacking something that really connects with me. The bonus characters shouldn't have been KS exclusives; indicative of the sacrificed breadth for production bling.

Was really impressed with this game. One of the best games I played in 2014. Heavy on negotiation and abstract area-control, which made it fun. However, Blood Rage in 2015 felt very similar to me, and was more fun.

Provisional rating, one play at Spiel. 3p, but probably would have been better with more, as with only two battles there didn't seem enough choice of where to fight. Lady Macbeth won, which now I've read some forum posts here, is not uncommon. My rating is based on liking the concept of the game plus an assumption that it can be balanced at some larger number of players - so take it with a pinch of salt.

RATING: 8.5
Great fun! It's rare to find a game that can field up to 5 players and still move very quickly.  At it's most basic, this game is just taking turns placing workers.  Rather than a traditional worker placement where you're trying to gather resources to build an engine, in this game everything is geared towards getting stronger cards in hopes to swing battles in your favor to gain reputation of the house(s) of your choice for end game victory points.

Basically the game is a platform for nonstop negotiating and backstabbing your friends, and that's great.

Intriguing game. I usually don't like games that cycle through a set of years and end up counting points. But this one keeps me interested thrice every round because of the tense battles and multiple things to keep track of.
Replayability is great as well.
And it looks fantastic on our table.
Quite surprised.

Solid WP type of game. Great components and I like the art. The theme is great. Very easy to learn and to teach. I like the different ways to score points. The biggest downfall was the special powers each army has seem incredibly imbalanced. Pink and Brown were too strong while yellow and grey were too weak. I think it needs some tweaking.

Too open with three players and all houses. The game rewards opportunistic play, do not get too attached with the two shields you got at the beginning.

This is a very strange Euro that pits the players against each other as minor houses throwing their support this way and that, in order to help the major houses of a fictional realm resolve a conflict over the control of a throne. So basically, it's Game of Thrones, but with weird steampunk imagery and game pieces featuring busts of people wearing absolutely ridiculous hats.

It's a crazy weird concept that is mostly a vehicle for Cool Mini or Not to sell a bunch of plastic, since the game itself could have easily been a purely cardboard release. The minis are both ridiculous and unnecessary. Still, the game is a lot of fun with plenty of wild swings of fortune and opportunities to make unexpected treacherous moves via card play. All in all, despite it's graphic design failures and silly over-produced miniatures and rule book, this is a fantastic and quick playing game with plenty to like for fans of negotiation and area control. If you can find it cheap, it's definitely worth a go.

Beautiful quality euro-with-negotiation game. Characters aren't especially balanced, but that's less important in an open ended game like this one. I freaking love the minis in this and I typically don't care about plastic.

After just one play i am still undecided about what i think of this game, mainly due to the fact that one of us kept thinking a lot about each and every move, therefore dragging the experience toward the very brink of shear desperation. So probably the negative impressions are so far due to that. Anyways:
DoW, in its full complete form, is a game with a strange mix of fantastic and disappointing materials, all mixed up. You can find gorgeous miniatures along with shitty counters. I mean, why? CMoN did a great job on some aspects, creating a lot of expectation, why then falling on several few points? The cards are glittering in gold, fantastic, but they aren't easy to read. Tactics cards are shameful, like 10 levels lower than the other cards and the font is some hardly readable handwriting. Why? There's no space on the board to put used tactics cards either. And what's the purpose of so many gray soldiers , what can you use them for if you have to place cards behind the battle little boards? It is all very strange and i really have to lower my rating for that, even if i am usually not even interested in materials!

About the game play: it is quite interesting to think were you want to engage yourselve and what reward to take, this is the nicest part of the game, even if, with the wrong people, can lead to a lot of analysis paralisis, be warned!
Sometimes it seems the fate of the one or two houses you are more interested in is decided only by other players and this can be a bit frustrating.
Leaving a turn early can give yo a great advantage in being the first going into battle in the next turn, this is also an interesting choice.
Players' extra powers are interesting even if sometimes they seem of very different level, but this is due to my scarse experience, probably.
I don't like the fact that once you push a battle toward epic victory any new point is not registered but if the opponent family scores even one single point the marker goes back to 14 or less and you lose the epic victory, even if on the family you supported there is a military force of 20+. Personally, i would close a battle after it reaches epic status and noone can play there anymore.

[EDIT]after my second play i still have to understand it. it sounds good, it plays good but i have not idea what should i do to win... i'll try it again

Steampunkish abstract war game where tactics rely more on betrayal and deception. Super engaging card art and wild Dogs of War minis in stark contrast to the off-putting but functional board. I still haven't got the hang of this one.

About as good as a kickstarter game gets these days.

Essentially a lighter stock market version of [i]Battle Merchants[/i].  I'm not sure I like the piling-on aspect, where players naturally gravitate towards the shields/stocks of the factions that win early.

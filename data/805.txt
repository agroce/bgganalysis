Game is complete and in very good shape.
There is some wear caused by storage and playing, but the box is not ripped on any of the seams.

A simple roll, move and fight game where it's everyone versus one player. Kind of reminds me of Last Night on Earth, but isn't as good.

This game has it's moments that will make you remember the TV show fondly. It's like the ultimate Ameritrash fan game. And I mean that in a good way. Lots of dice rolling and some opportunity for slamming your friends. Lush production with very nice components. I'd buy the game for the Buffy head-shot on the box cover alone!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun enough... very thematic and enjoyable, but depends very much on the victory conditions. In the first scenario, the right cards and dice rolls can win the game in one turn. Which definitely happened the first time we played. Anyway, I'll play it again... despite its problems.

For its target market it was quite good but I didn't live long enough to enjoy the game, but I watched the others play long enough to know I didn't really want to play again to find out anything else.

RATING: 7
A wonderful marriage of theme. Really evokes the series pretty well, and having different bosses with different goals was a great touch. The bits are great, though the center "moon clock" thing is pretty ripped up from putting it in and out of the holders. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It probably helps if I had ever watched the show.  Solid game.  Pretty simple and has quite a bit of roll-and-move, but the moon system was pretty cool and how that affected the wearwolf guy (Oz?) and the combat system worked well with the double-stake system.  Probably more card-passing between the good guys than should be allowed, though.

Love this game.  Amazed an IP could play so well.  Best with 2 or 3 players.  4 or 5 works, but is likely to have player elimination.  Wouldn't consider being rid of it as is a favorite around here.

Actually purchased a second one - new and still in shrink wrap, as I do not want to ever be without a copy.  =D

Play time: 2.5 hrs

Much better than I expected it to be.  The board design reminds me of Clue.  Evil seems to have an advantage unless the good players coordinate their efforts.  I'd love to see scenerios for the final three seasons...

Finally broke this one out. Neat little game with interesting tactical elements, and great fun for fans of the TV series.  Lot's of luck/risk management necessary so it may not appeal to control freaks.  We had a great time with our first play, which went right down to the wire.  The good guys won with Buffy staking the Master while she had exactly 1 life point left!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In the style of games like Hero Quest, but more structured and themed after the TV series. Pretty enjoyable and fast-paced, but limited in replay value and sometimes hard to talk people into. Needs some house rules to smooth some bumpy parts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I've been a fan of Betrayal at House on the Hill for a while now and finally got to play this in 2013 and for a game from 2000 it has held up really well. At least in terms of gameplay and in evoking its theme, the components leave a lot to be desired as while the Hero boards help keep things organized, they could have been better designed along with the cards with their nonstandard size. But apart from my component issues, the rules are very intuitive and make sense which allows players to really focus in on the game and story. The good players all have their own unique qualities which encourages a lot of table talk for them on how to best strategize their turn. And the game scenarios while limited feel really balanced allowing the evil player to be as evil as possible. Overall quite the surprise and an easy pick up for Buffy Fans.

Unfortunately, the box lid has a fairly substantial dish to it, thus bowing out the front edge.  Once inside, however, you'll find essentially a new game.  All pawns, card holders, etc. are unpunched and all the pawn holders, dice, cards, etc. are still in their factory sealed bags and shrink wrap.  The stickers for the dice are flat and perfect as well.  Complete, and if you're not too picky about box condition, new.

*I was very surprised to see how good the game actually is. I really really like this game.
Some scenarios might be long, when two equal players are against each other, but in all ways, this game delivers. Me and my girlfriend love this game and give this one some table time as well for that...

RATING: 7
For a role-and-move mechanic, this is still a great game.  Granted, I'm a huge Buffy fan, so maybe I'm a little biased.  But this game does a good job at capturing the theme of the series.  It is simple (which is usually a bad thing for me), but that makes it one of the few games that my family enjoys.

It's pretty surprising that a game from Milton Bradley based on a 90s TV show could be this good! This is pure card-playing, dice-rolling, trashy fun in the style of Last Night on Earth, and if you're a fan of Buffy (and the Scoobies and the Big Bads) you'll lap this one up. Good fun, but due to the slight amount of cards and scenarios, probably not so hot on long-term replayability. And if you're not into Buffy, there's not much to see here.

Mechanics wise this game is a bit, meh.  It's roll and move and there isn't a whole lot to do.  Somehow the game rises above that and very much feels like an episode of Buffy.  Each character is specialized in what they can do and feels right.  Willow is good at magic, Oz sucks unless he is a werewolf and Buffy is a powerhouse.  Each different boss has unique endgame conditions which provides great replayability.  Fun game that creates tons of "remember when" moments.  Worth the money to track down if you're a fan of classic Ameritrash.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I've only watched 2 episodes of the TV show, but this game is pretty good for a roll-and-move, semi-coop, one-vs-many game (perhaps it falls into the Ameri-trash miniatures genre?).  It's a luck-heavy and tactical game with light strategy and a little character development.  There are a total of 4 official scenarios/bosses to be played (plus a few that are fan-made), and each one has a goal that usually involves racing to find a certain artifact and use/destroy it (or sometimes just keep it away from the opposition).  There's something fun and tense about the good versus evil cat-and-mouse game of racing around the board, playing keep-away with the artifact cards, and trying to stay alive long enough to succeed at the mission.  Supposedly, the theme is very well integrated with the game.  It was my most played game when I was at college (before I started tracking plays on BGG so my true number of plays is probably 30 more than the tally shown on BGG).

** Warning: don't leave Buffy alone on the graveyard side of the board at the start -- evil will usually win by killing her quickly. **

Good game. The show tie-in is nicely done. On the plus side this is a cooperative game in the spirit of Fury & BaHotH and is probably pretty balanced over all. On the negative side some of the [i]players themselves[/i] are relatively unbalanced, Xander for example. That said, I play games for the enjoyment of them and this one fits the bill. 

Does anyone else feel like they're moving around a Clue board..? :p

Whoa, This game plays fast (which I like). There's not a ton of depth to this game, but it's still enjoyable becaue it's so fast paced (and the theme is a big plus for me). It's like an adventure game filler. My only complaints are that there are only four scenarios, Xander sucks in the game, and they should have included Cordelia as a playable character (perhaps the player that controls Xander, also gets Cordelia because they're both pretty worthless except as an extra set of hands).

Makes a lot more sense and is more enjoyable if you've seen the TV show, but it's actually a good game in and of itself.  Lots of dice and cards, so can be painful if luck's not going your way, but just makes for hilarious sessions.  We still talk about the time that Willow (with 1 health point left) managed to take out the Master!

This was actually pretty fun, even if the game shows its age. I'm not a fan of roll-and-move, but without it the strong chase aspect of this game wouldn't be nearly as tense or fun.

I know absolutely nothing about Buffy, but playing it with Buffy-maniac friends was amusing.  As I recall, this wasn't a bad cooperative sort of fighting game, despite the commercialized theme.  (I'm sure it's *much* better than most games based on TV shows/movies; I'm not keen on playing the Desperate Housewives trivia game, for instance.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good game that captures the feel of the show very well.  I loved it the first couple plays, but then it began to wear thin.  I've only played as the evil crew, which is very challenging given the wealth of helpful cards that good players run around collecting every turn.  The evil player's strategy balls down to using sewer cards to ambush good guys foolish enough to stray from the pack, while avoiding Buffy and to a lesser extent Oz.  Siring is a mistake as the sired are easily "saved" and come back with full health.  Nah, kill them, and kill them early, especially, and it hurts  me to say this, especially Willow.  But knocking off Oz is vaguely enjoyable . . .

Good tends to herd together, hopping from card space to card space, and transferring those to the characters most capable to use them, all in preparation for a "big rush" at the villain.  It amazes me that people find it fun to play the good side, but they do darn it, they do.

I enjoy playing the game, and it often results in moments that you can "just see" happening in the show, the villain killed by an almost dead Buffy using an art easel for example. The evil side is the most challenging to play, you've got to use your wits, make very few mistakes, rapidly cycle through the evil deck to keep the decent cards coming, and be lucky with the dice.  Still, my buddy D may have been on to something when he observed that it's a game for kids where Dad plays the villain and good always wins.

Standing on its own, it's not a great game, especially for its length, but with a group of Buffy fans it's fun as hell.  And I don't even like cooperative games.

We played with a mod where Evil can always choose to roll 'Big Bad and 1 minion' because rolling 3 minions and not being able to move the Big Bad is just stupid.  I think this was a good choice, otherwise the game would be too unbalanced against Evil.

It doesn't have a lot of strategy. I'm not fond of two player games mascarading as a multiplayer game. I'm not even a fan of the show. But I still had a ball playing it. The game does have great theme and something undefineable. No, its the link you get with your character surviving that draws you in. There are also some difficult decisions so its not devoid of strategy. I liked it better than that Lord of the Rings game where all the players are on the same side. Verses the one player who runs the bad team.

Not a bad game at all.  Has some old-fashioned conventions that I could do without (roll and move), but all in all plays fairly creatively for a Milton Bradley product.

Highly recomend if you can still get a copy of. Given the game as a gift 2 years ago (everyone in my house BUFFY FREAK).  I remember thinking that there was something missing????????????????? the first play. It must have been my sense of adventure!!  What a fun game.  Cooperative and yet everyman for themselves at the same time. Great mix of choices and battle, yes dice, but the dice have stakes and teeth on them.  There are also Majik dice and spells. Quite suprising for a TV show game.  Only a 8.5 because the quality of cards could be desired other wise a 9.

I declined to rate this game after my first play (it was a hesitant, stumbling, far-from-memorable affair - very possibly due to my opponent's lack of affection for anything remotely fantastic in its theme). My second game was a resounding success, full of fun and sure to provide that particular group with hilarious in-jokes for a long time to come. It's simple, straightforward, engaging and possessed of a surprisingly successful integration of theme and mechanics. Now, several games later, I've increased my rating. It's just a LOT of fun. The kind of fun that inspires animated conversation, both during and long after the game is played. The good guys can pull off breathless, eleventh-hour escapes from the clutches of certain doom, while the forces of evil, who moments before were staring at inescapable defeat, can summon up hitherto unsuspected surprises, turning the tables yet again. And yes, the game really can generate that sort of narrative feel. My opponent this evening gleefully recounted details of a game played nearly a year ago in just such a narrative style... and he hadn't even PLAYED that session. He'd merely heard those details from the people who WERE there! And in my book, at least, that's saying a helluva lot.

Components: Shabby components, and inelegant graphic design. Nice, heavy dice. Good selection of photos. The board is well thought out. The designers had a good sense of the show when balancing characters and creating the various cards. The absence of Giles, though, is a major slap in the face; Giles was the first Scoobie!

Experience: Quick and fun. Good teamwork on behalf of the Scoobies, and it's fun to be the forces of Evil, swarming around the board attacking the heroes. The dice-rolling is fun. Not a lot of strategy; basically just collecting cards and rolling dice. It does a good job of evoking the theme (though I wish it covered all seven seasons).

theme is the key, and the game play mechanics don't get in the way. it helps to have a Master who is at the top of his/her game to push the Scoobs.  Also someone who knows the backstory of the series can add a lot of flava to the proceedings.

Tremendous use of license to create an enjoyable game. Fans of the series should take note and find a copy while it's still available.

Very light game with a strong theme. Dice-heavy combat with card draws occasionally providing lucky swings as well. Still many choices to make, and an interesting sense of narrative that develops every time.

RATING: 8
Not bad at all for an Ameritrash roll and move game. Rich in theme and nice components. If you like the series you will love this. if not it is still interesting and there are some pretty cool mechanics and scenerios that fit the series and theme well.  The good vs evil balance looks preety accurate too.

I'm a big fan of the series, so I think that I enjoyed it more than a non-fan would.  But this really was a  good game with excellent components.  Clear rules, lots of alternatives, lots of variation, lots of fighting, lots of fun.  If you are a fan, you must get this game.

I'm a big fan of Buffy and this game did do a good job of capturing the feel of the series. However, I'm not a fan of Ameritrash/Amerifun and this was nothing but. After ninety minutes I (playing as the Master) was very tempted to throw the game, just to end the cycle of chuck some dice, count spaces, chuck some more dice.

On the very rare occasion that I'm of a mind to play something of this type - I'll go for Last Night on Earth every time.

RATING: 8
A rare tie-in game that actually evokes the spirit of the show considerably. I just wish it had the slightest bit more chrome when it comes to differentiating weapon types (especially ranged weapons) and paid more attention to the shows continuity regarding character availability.  Still, consistently surprising, just like the shows it's based on.

RATING: 6
Great theme, but play mechanics are a little lacking.  Roll dice, then get a card or attack a vampire (assuming roll is high enough to get there).  When a vampire or slayer gets enough hits, it dies. That's the meat of it really.  There's random stuff that can happen based on card draws and die rolls (night versus day).  My first game lasted about 5-10 minutes as Buffy was quickly killed off.  The 2nd game was over just as fast...though we kept playing until all the slayers were killed.  So after 2 games, it appears to have balance issues.  However, I would definitely play it again because, although it lacks strategy, I still find it fun.  I'm a sucker for theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Rather good cooperative type game based on the TV show, up to around series 3.  Players play good or evil and roam Sunnydale trying to do the other side in.  Each game is played as a "mission" and it works very well.  Good fun!

Great game - a lite RPG, with multiple scenarios. Hopefully they come out with more scenarious/expansions in the future. One additional note - I like how this game has a cooperative element like LOTR, but unlike LOTR, players will actually squabble among each other a lot of the time since no one knows how long they will sit out if they die (In LOTR you have a good idea how long you will sit out).

RATING: 6
Good. Obviously crafted by someone with an understanding of good board games, and a love of the show.  It's a good lighter game but fills a weird niche.  It's not as good as Fury of Dracula, which is usually my choice for a many-against-one game.  But it's too long to be a filler.  It also has limited replayability. Once you go through all the seasons two or three times, there's not a whole lot there.

A simple roll and move game that makes you feel like you are going through a season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  The story archs mimic those from the show and it is a fun 4 vs. 1 game.

One of those licensed, mass market Ameritrash games that is highly praised in some gaming circles.  I guess I can see why.  It has variable player powers, 1 vs. many game play, and light RPG elements similar to the other Ameritrash greats.  I thought it was just ok, but I can see why it is highly praised from the majority of the licensed game garbage.

Terrific mass-market adventure game of many-versus-one.  The four quests are a little similar to each other (It's like there are really only two quests with minor differences). 

Still, it's fun skirmish action and a rare licensed game from Hasbro that doesn't suck monkey nuts.

It's no longer in stores, but it seems to appear in a lot of thrift stores and on a lot of trade lists.  If you're an Ameritrash or Buffy fan, go ahead and take the plunge and get a copy of this into your collection.  It's Epic Duels level of fun, and if that sentence made you tingle, then make double-time to get your copy today.

I love this game. One of the best American games based on a tv show that I ever played. It kind of reminds me of a cross between Arkaham Horror and Last Night on Earth. The game is very easy to play and the rules are written very well and easy to understand. Try it you'll surely like it.

Simple enough for young children, but with enough chrome and non-obvious decisions to keep adults interested. I'd say that's a smart design decision for a game based on a TV show that caters to a similarly-broad age range. The Buffy game will probably appeal mostly to those with some knowledge of the subject matter.  The game's not great, though - without the Buffy theme, it would rate a couple points lower.

The best $10, TV-show-based, Milton Bradley game I ever bought at Toys R Us.

(Which isn't exactly glowing praise, so let me add that I really *do* love this game. Probably the "gateway" game that moved me from Clue and Monopoly to actual board games.) -- June 2010

I played this at Marcon before I started logging, and I thrifted a copy in 2007 (maybe 2006).  I would play more if I had willing opponents.  I used to say this was the best licensed game out there.  Then BSG came along.  Seems to be better if you're familiar with the series, though.

My siblings gave this to me as a Christmas present a few years back, and well, we had low expectations despite our love of the show. We were delighted to find the game to be extremely well designed and fun to play as well.  If only HasBro would release an expansion for seasons 5 thru 7. Maybe we'll see this after the series finale.

RATING: 6
On par with Betrayal at House on the Hill and maybe a bit below Last Night on Earth to scratch the same itch.  Its fun for fans of the show to imagine the scenario unfolding.  However, at the end, there is too much abstracted and simplified as it should be for a mass-market game.  Its a good mass-market game that I would play again but I probably won't be the one suggesting it.

RATING: 7
One of the better licensed products out there, BTVS the Game effectively compresses a season of the show into a single game, with scenarios covering the first four seasons.  Clearly some attention to detail is shown in crafting the scenarios.  Minor characters are featured via the "Help" deck.

Mechanically, it's roll for movement on a grid, and dice for combat.  This would drag in a longer game but hits the spot just fine in a one-hour game.

Worth playing again.

7 - Good game, usually willing to play ('Geek Definition). Ok, this brings back 'classic' American board games for me and my youth. It feels so much like an old school board game in the 'roll and move', but it's got more too it. It's fun, the moon and sun make it interesting as you have to plan ahead and the scenarios (based on the first 4 Buffy seasons) give it some great variety. I would reccommend this if you long for a bit more of the 'old school' board game flavor and if you just want to have some fun taking it to some friends who are trying vainly to thwart your clearly dominant evil plans: I WILL get away with it and it'll be in spite of you meddling kids too! 

PS_it is great for those involved with the show as the characters have more flavor with your understanding of the episodes, but anyone can play this and have a good time with it.

Wonderful adaptation.

Got it at auction for $3.00 but looking at it doesn't give me a clue to how to rate it so it'll take awhile to get it to the table.
Update: Best $3.00 game I ever bought. The game is really a lot of light fun but still has some "meat" to it in the battles and strategy. Perfect if you're in the mood for a horror game but don't want the complexity of ARKHAM or the zillions of counters of HOUSE. Sold it to Mike K for his kids.

Demoted to a 6 because of some design flaws discovered the last time we played. If The Mayor gets his hands into the Glove of Myneghan, or however that's spelled, then he can use it with impunity seven times. I think his special ability overpowers him a little. Also, Oz doesn't get the opportunity to transform enough, and the card that turns Angelus into Angel is either totally useless or totally unfair, depending on whether or not he's in the game. Besides a few creaky balance issues, though, this is still an awesome game.

Love this game! I'm not even a big Buffy fan. This is pure Adventure gaming so strategists should beware. It uses the alternate dice method for combat (I LOVE THAT) and includes so much of the genre (werewolves and vampires and demons) that normally boardgames don't bother including (they easily could have made the game with just one villain and omitted the werewolf element for the good argument of cost effectiveness). Perfect filler game as it can easily be a 15 minute or 1 hour game depending on how much people get into it.

Aside from the massive setup, this game is pretty fun for a lighthearted game (for beginners) and then full of strategy for those who make it that way.  Graphics are amazing, but they obviously didn&#039;t market the game well.
I&#039;m a massive Buffy fan, which is why I think I even HEARD about the game, and had to aquire it online since no local retailers carried it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
As others have said, this game is much better than one might expect for a game based on a TV show.  

What's great is that both the Big Bad (the GM type character) and the Scooby Gang (the good guys) have their own objectives to win, which can even change as the game progresses. This means that, even though it's a dungeoncrawl, the good guys aren't simply clearing out rooms in a dungeon.  There's a cat and mouse game around the board as the players try to meet their objectives.

The theme really comes through too.  Buffy is a straightforward tank.  Willow's fragile but extremely powerful and has a variety of powers.  Oz is normally weak, but will temporarily turn into a werewolf and become a hazard to the bad guys (this is one of the better mechanics of the game).  Even Xander is well themed: normally weak, but his ability to hold two "Help" cards means he can have heroic moments.

Unfortunately, all of the theming will turn off non-Buffy fans. But even if you're not a Buffy fan, you should play this game if you're a fan of "ameritrash" games.

If you like Buffy, and you like board games, you should play this.

Wonderful game to play at conventions, especially for fans of the show. Most tie-in games are lousy roll-and-moves, but this one is much better. A bit of a dungeon crawl for board gamers. It comes with four Big Bad scenarios to choose from, and it's pretty hard to beat the evil player. Each of the characters has abilities and limitations that match right up with the show's characters. 

Update: After several more playings, I've upped my rating to a 9. This just gets better. Additional Big Bads and scenarios have been uploaded to BGG.

Only played one real game, 3 players. I and my friend as the good team, Bob as the baddies. It was an hours-long snoozefest because we kept killing minions, which he then kept replacing. 

Basically, for this to be fun, you HAVE to realize that you need to go straight for the big bad. I'm still eager to try this again with the proper strategy in mind, but unfortunately my friends are leery now. :(

Dragged a bit when we played the second scenario, but being a huge Buffy fan, I was still into it every second.  Even though the game dragged on, there were still meaningful decisions to make throughout the process, and plenty of discussion going on.  I think the game captures the Buffy universe, if not the style very well.

This game is incredibly easy to stalemate.  Too many opportunities for both sides to draw cards.  Maybe some house rules about drawing and using cards would make the game end a little more naturally.  I still enjoy the game

This is one of the few games based on a TV show that is actually any good. The components are very well done and the game drips with theme. There are 4 different scenarios to play each with different goals for the Scooby gang. If you have ever watched the show, you'll have a lot of fun playing and get all the references to the show. If you've never seen the show, you'll still have a good time. Turn down the lights, put on some scary music and stake some bad guys!

Licensed games used to be a gamble, but this one is actually pretty decent for the time. It was clearly designed by someone who loves the show and who took care in their design. Everything ties well to the show, and while I'm not generally into games for their themes, with this one the flavour was what won me over. It's a one versus the rest type of game, where one player takes on the bad guy from a specific scenario and the other players divide the scooby gang among them depending on player count. I can envision this player being equally good with 2 and 3, though I think with more the good side might not feel they each have much to do. Players collect helpers, spells, artifacts, etc and try to maneuver their characters so they can attack the other side. Whoever achieves their objective first wins.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My first play (I was The Master) went very badly. Spike and Drusilla got killed right away as I couldn't roll anything good in combat. Plus, The Master blanked three times trying to pick up an artifact. Then The Master had about three out of four turns where he didn't get activated, which allowed the heroes to surround him and hammer him down. I had drawn several Sire a Vampire cards and elected to just stay put and take a shot at winning by attacking Buffy. I did  manage to get a five-dice attack and rolled one fang, but that was the closest I got to achieving anything for the whole game. I also failed to roll a magik symbol when trying to summon Harmony. Epic fail all around.

Clearly, this game could end disappointingly early with the right card and dice combo. And somebody could be losing badly but win similarly on a really lucky combo. The way the staking system is set up, it's always going to be a real possibility.

I can see how this is a pretty good game, though, with a reasonable probability of having a solid length and satisfying conclusion. I'd certainly play it again. I could easily see it moving up to an 8.

I would also like to remind everyone that Willow was 1,000 times hotter than Buffy. And not just "nerd hot," either.

Thanks to Withered Hand for trading this. Looks like fun. Thanks to droolster for getting me the Buffy pawn.

Nice integration of theme. I played against the Judge, and the objective is to get your hands on a certain artifact, then use a certain spell (which also isn't a piece of cake to get) to destroy it. That seems like the plot of many a Buffy episode. The good players also have variable player powers appropriate to their character.

One drawback is that it doesn't include any mechanic to ensure that each player on the good side plays their own character. An experienced or domineering player could simply instruct the other player what to do. Some other cooperative games prohibit disclosing information about your hand, so a player has more information to make decisions for their characters.

Played this once at a FLGS.  I watched a show sporadically so I knew most of the characters.  Seemed like a fun game for fans of the show but the game also seemed too easy...we cornered the Master vampire and he got staked.  However it could have easily gone the other way since Buffy was almost dead as well.  Not a big fan though.  Components are high quality though.  Just wasn't my kind of game.

Seems to be weighted towards the good guys, but I guess that's to be expected to keep the fans happy. The night/day wheel adds a bit of tension and makes the Oz character fun to play. The missus likes this one.

Played two one-on-one games with GF. She was evil both times, she really wants to kill Buffy LOL !

But the Scooby Gang was too tough !

It looks like evil has a bit of a disadvantage.

Overall, an easy and fun game. The moon phases make it interesting with werewolves popping up, only to change back to their human forms shortly thereafter. Then when the sun comes up the bloodsuckers scatter ! Fun stuff :)

This is my teenage daughter's favorite game.  Yes, she is a big fan of the TV series, but the game stands on its own merits.  Can feel like a glorified game of tag, but this dicefest holds our interest.

RATING: N/A
In good to fair condition. The box is bowed on the top, and there is shelfwear on the box and corners. The cards are made of thin stock and show that they have been played (some of them don't lay perfectly flat, but you can probably be able to fix this by gently bending them). One of the cards (artifact I think) has a vertical rip in it about an inch long, which has been taped but you can tell from the back of the card that there was a rip in it (you will either have to choose to ignore the rip, or pretend not to see it when playing; I do think you could make the noticeable part of the rip on the back of the card pretty much disappear if you touched up the back of the card with a gold marker). Also Buffy's standee got scrunched, she still stands, but one side is creased. Everything else is there and in very good to excellent condition.

The cream-dream for BGG Buffy fans everywhere, why did we Brits get a rubbish Monopoly style game when there was this!?

Picked this up for $2.99 at Goodwill. Got me to watch the show, which has become one of my favorites. The game itself is good, trashy fun, even it relies heavily on its theme. This makes for a good throwback game if you're feeling nostalgic for roll-and-move stuff, though it does hold up really well by today's standards, surprisingly. That aside, this game feels like a tactical skirmish game meets Arkham Horror, in all the right ways.

I got into Buffy just this past year (2008).  In the course of about 6 months I watched the first 4 seasons, and then I ended up getting this game as a birthday present for my oldest daughter (14).  Don't laugh!  It was not a case of "present to other as present to self." I swear! My daughter was a _huge_ fan of Smallville, and enjoyed Buffy.  So I thought, why not?  Her favorite game prior to Buffy was probably Betrayal at House on the Hill.  Also, I liked the fact that Buffy is a semi-co-op because that the three of us (me and two daughters) can play w/o issues of hurt feelings.

So, long story short, this has been a GREAT game.  It has become my daughter's new favorite.  Yes, it's more campy fun if you know the show, but there's a nice game under the hood.  A bit like Last Night on Earth, actually.  The good guys run around trying to get weapons, help, etc (all in the form of cards), and distribute them to those who can best use them.  But watch out because the bad guys are getting more powerfully evil (cards again), and you wouldn't want Xander or Willow to get turned into a vampire!  The mechanics are actually kind of nifty.  Movement dice also will sometimes move the moon through its phases or cause a brief interlude of daytime.  Combat dice have fangs, stakes, kick, punch, etc on them.  And the bad guys don't always get to move all of their pieces.    All in all, there's a nice current of goofy panic on both sides that mirrors the show pretty well.

OK game, good, but not exceptional production quality, though the dice are nice and heavy.  Play is two sided, found our one experience is that evil kicked some serious ass.  Gameplay is running around a map collecting cards that give powers.  Attacking opponents is pretty one sided.  Dice based.  Repeat play possible, enjoyed it.  Reccomended.

RATING: 6
Standard roll-and-move fare. After moving, pick up a card or fight. Combat is resolved simply by rolling some attack dice. Gameplay consists purely of rolling dice and occasionally playing a card. The card effects are very simple, they usually just give you some extra dice for your rolls.

Without the theme, this would be just another completely uninteresting mass-market game with obsolete mechanics. But you just can't ignore that it's Buffy, and most of the components have photos of the cast on them ;P

So. I love these kinds of games, I like 1 vs. all setups, I like dice and item cards--but our first game just collapsed into a pile of player pawns all in one building, everybody trapping each other in and just standing there throwing dice at each other. I wonder if some of the other scenarios are better.

This is a great game. It is fast, has lots of cool and great-looking stuff, and much interaction in the game. It is also one of the &quot;one against many&quot; games, and has very different conditions for every player. Of course it depends much on luck and is a dice-fest, but it is one of the best of those type of games. Negative is player elimination and therefore 3 players are best, with the good players playing two characters each.

I have had this one for several years now but hadn't placed it on the list.
We played it once and it sat on the shelf with little or no interest to play it again for quite some time.
I felt like giving it a try again and it's a good board game with tons of theme from the old television series.
Now that anyone can watch the show with it's many seasons on Netflix now, I think it will appeal to more people again.

In this game, one player will be the evil overlord and there are 4 to choose from each with it's own unique win conditions.
The evil player will summon characters from the TV show that were of course evil.
The good players will all be characters from the TV series: Buffy, OZ, Xander and Willow.
OZ comes with a special character sheet with one side for his human form and one side for his Werewolf form.

This isn't a game that is meant to last long, in fact I think you can play in under an hour easily. Turns are fairly quick.
Move, draw a card, fight or use magic.

In the center of the board is a dial for the day and night phases.
Very important for Oz and some other werewolf characters as they will transform at the full moon becoming more powerful.
But at the same time dropping everything they had collected.

The vampires of course must be inside buildings when the marker crosses the sun space.
Characters take damage fairly easily in the game with really no way of recovering.
So characters good or evil will go down quickly.

The wife and kids like the show and this game. I usually have to play the evil players, since the kids already have their favorite character they want to play.  Scenario #1 is great for learning the game and the remaining scenarios make the good characters work harder. Overall, during family game night, this one gets played more than I had expected.

RATING: 5
It’s nothing but move with dice rolls, pick up cards that help, and then fight with dice rolls, but the strong theming ensured that our role play provided the fun necessary for an enjoyable game. 

The game is all dice, so don’t expect too much strategy. Fandom of Buffy obviously increases the gaming experience, allowing you to vicariously re-live sequences from episodes as the characters beat each other up and you’d have to recommend the game for the real fans out there. For the gamer, hmmm, not much. There’s co-operative play, or not, against the evil one, deciding how best to go about things (a bit LotR-ish), but in the end, you just have to beat things up (ie roll dice) until they accrue enough damage points to die. All the fun is in the theme, with a jab jab here, and a kick kick there, here a jab, there a kick, everywhere a jab kick.

I'd rate this one as a game that only fans of the show should try.

A much better game than you might expect. Simple roll and move mechanics, rolls lots of dice to attack, play cards to boost your abilities. But it drips with theme, summon enemies from the first 4 seasons of Buffy, use items from specific episodes, even turn players into vampires or give Angel his soul back. Pretty good balance too. Better with more players and fans of the show. Strategically it still doesn't hold up to modern euros, the dice add a lot of luck.

This game is surprisingly enjoyable.  It's fun to play Oz or to fight the Master or to kick Spike in the face.  The co-op play is fun.  But for people who aren't familiar with the world of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, this game wouldn't be fun.  It's too simplistic, and too dependent on the theme.  So if you are looking for a fun co-op that will engage someone who isn't familiar with the show, this is not your game.  But I like some of the characters and situations from the show.  So I'm amused.

RATING: 6.5
06-03-2015. Rated after 2 plays. I haven't seen more than one complete episode, while eyeing my girlfriend seeing the show for the second time a short while back, so I cannot comment on the theme.

I think as a game, the Buffy game here is pretty decent. As shown on it's average geek rating, the game is not a typical movie/licence rip. The game plays as a 1 vs many 'team'-based death-match, in which the players try to kill opposing characters while obtaining certain objectives (Killing buffy, killing the main villain). 

Basically, during the game each hero activates and takes his turn. They roll movement dice, walk around. If you end your movement on a colored dot, you get cards and get to attack adjacent people. You roll combat dice, that roll various melee hits, stakes and bites. If you ever roll 2 stakes, you kill a heatlty vampire or 1 stake for a wounded. 

Enemies work almost the same, although the enemy player rolls a die at the statt of their turn to see how many and which of their units they may activate (X henchmen, villain?). They then take their actions as normally. 

The fun twist in this game is that there are artifacts to obtain, which are vital in many of the quests. Another fun thing is that you need to try to manipulate the moon-cycle track. If it ever becomes day, the vampires need to rush inside, taking damage for each step it takes to reach it. During full-moon, the werewolves transform into ridiculously powerful things while during the night the evil player takes more cards.

The game is fun. It's ameritrash at it's best. Die-rolling, attacking, theme (I think). It's all there. To me, that makes the game a fun diversion on about the weight and feel as Heroquest. Give it a try if you ever come across a cheap copy. Main downsides of this game are the luck (if you mind that) and the ugly board by nowadays standards.

Surprisingly good - has sort of a Last Night on Earth mechanic, though a couple of the scenarios are unbalanced.  Note that I'm no Joss Whedon fan (I don't dislike him, it's just that his work doesn't much interest me), and I've never actually seen an episode of Buffy, so theme's not clouding my judgment.

Bought for $1.29 at a Thrift Store.  It was taped closed and smooshed a little at the top.  I didn't have high hopes, but after carefully removing the tape and opening it up... everything was UNPUNCHED.  I ended up selling this for around $50.  Holy crap!!!

Light version of Arkham horror. Making the big-bad a player is interesting as it gives them a bit more depth compared to Arkham's one-or-two special powers...

All in all, I think this could be a better game if it had anything like the support of it's bigger brother...

No matter how great the reviews got for this game, I would never have bought this game for two reasons: First, I hate admitting I watch this show (and enjoy it!). Second, and more importantly, if some of my friends saw I had a Buffy game, I would be tormented mercilessly for the rest of my life.

So, why do I now own a copy of Buffy the Vampire Slayer game? I found it at Goodwill still in shrinkwrap and it only cost me a few dollars--I just couldn't pass it up.

I guess someone didn't (or wasn't allowed) to even give it a chance. That really is unfortunate for them because it really is a great game. No doubt about it. Although it has four scenarios you can play, it would be an easy thing for a fan of the show to come up with new villains, new creatures, new scenarios to keep the game from getting old.

Rule #1: Maximum of three players!
It's fun. It's fast. It's got tactics to boot. I've played this dozens of times and, with three players especially, it's a hoot. It helps you get into it if you watch the series - got to be able to distinguish your vampires from your demons.

RATING: 6
I don't know about this one. I really want to like it because it's a game based on Buffy and it honestly doesn't suck, but it's a little rough and swingy. I think the fact that when you're attacked you just 'take the damage' kills it for me. It's a fun thematic game though if you like the show.

MASSIVE amounts of thematic fun if you're a Buffy fan.  If not, there's still a surprisingly decent game hiding behind the Hasbro brand and TV-show theme.

Only 1 play but had a fantastic time.  I wouldn't be pulling it out at games night every week, but if you're a Buffy fan and have other Buffy fans to play with - then you'll wanna get this one out a couple of times per year and have an absolute blast with it.

Great rich theme running right through it which really makes this shine.  1 player is the baddie, the others are the goodies playing co-op (with really nice co-op play actually) and trying to kill the baddie.

I don't know how I'd feel about it if I wasn't a Buffy fan being full Ameritrash fare, lots of rolling for movement and combat, direct attacking of other characters and player elimination, but if you're Sunnydalecentric, definitely check it out.

I love Buffy and even though I don't like this game I have to give it props for what it is. I mean Hasbro could have just shoved some sh*t in a box and covered it with Buffy art and fans would have bought it, and let's face it that's what Hasbro usually does with an IP. But someone actually put a little thought into it with the phases of the moon effecting Oz and how vamps couldn't run around in the day light. The scenarios for each Big Bad were thematic and designed well. So while it may not be my cup of tea it's certainly a well designed game considering where it came from.

The game works well with the theme.  Kinda fun, not very deep.  Has serious endgame problems.  Games end when the baddie or buffy die.  You can kill with the right weapon/evil card too easily with the right roll.  So it doesn't matter how healthy or powerfull you are, it all comes down to the luck of the dice.  Hmmm.  Other than that fun enough?

I really like the feel of this game; it's both cooperative and oppositional. And there are many unofficial scenarios to try out, too.

A must-own if you're a fan of the show, as it's dripping with theme. It's actually a pretty well-done game in its own right. It is possible for Buffy to get trapped early and for the game to end quickly, but there's actually an interesting balance between the two sides. Each game element materially contributes to the game, which is not often the case in games like these (they typically are superfuluos chrome added to satisfy the theme rather than the game play). I really love the phase chart, and the cards generate for some interesting turns. Combat is simple and quickly resolved. Certainly not something I'd play all the time, but it's actually something I would enjoy from time to time.

RATING: 6
For a roll-and-move game from Milton Bradley this one isn't too bad at all, especially for fans of the series.

There are a handful of different scenarios each with different villains, items, and objectives.  So you can play the game a handful of different ways.  There's bolstering of your arsenal, dice-based combat, and a modicum of strategy involved in dealing with each of the scenarios.  It is also very thematic as each of the scenarios and items in the game tie closely in with the series.

Some of the playable characters are definitely more interesting than others and past the novelty for fans of the series there probably isn't a whole lot here for serious gamers.  But it's cute and provides a healthy dose of nostalgia.

A game that should not be any good by any rights but is actually fantastic. When my friends and I first saw it in the early 2000s, we assumed it to be an easy cash grab with no real game to back it up. They were huge fans of the series and insisted we tried it and I'm glad we did. Cuntless hours were spent playing this game and coming up with our own scenarios. I'm not even that big of a Buffy fan, but this board game evoked a lot of elements I love in games: strategy, replayability, and teamwork. Now if only we could figure out a way to easily decide who plays evil!

I'll preface my comments by stating that I've never seen a single episode of this TV show.  But I purchased this game for a friend who is (was?) a huge Buffy fan, so hopefully she enjoyed it more than I did.  After all the praise I had read from this game's cult following, I guess I was expecting a little more out of it.  In its favour, it did feel like a super-light version of "Fury of Dracula", but my first impression was that there simply wasn't as much tactical maneuvering involved as I would like.  The production value of the game is pretty decent, and it might be a little more fun with a group of 3 or 5 than with just 2, but I'm not in a great rush to try it again.  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 5/10

RATING: 5
Solid 1-vs-many story game where one player takes the forces of evil (one boss and several minions from one of Buffy's first four seasons, depending on scenario) and the others each one of Buffy, Willow, Xander and Oz.

Each turn a player can move up to the distance they roll on the two movement dice, pick up different kids of items if they stop on appropriate squares, and attack. Item cards can be used in combination with the combat dice to do damage, to turn/stake enemies (depending on side), or perform other effects (such as spells of teleportation). There's lots of thematic flavour, e.g. a moon track that sees Oz turn into a super-strong werewolf and helper cards representing various Sunnydale denizens.

Buffy fits in the same light, thematic bucket as games like HeroQuest. It's not one I particularly want to play as a game, but enjoyable as a fan of the series. Like D&D, it rewards wild swings of luck -- it's entirely possible to win in the first turn given a lucky stake/turn roll.

RATING: 6
This game is a surprisingly good adaptation from the TV show.  Despite the dice-based combat system, the game does feature some strategy with all the different cards and the different storylines featuring unique goals (rather than just kill all your opponents).  I also like that the character abilities fit well with their personalities (e.g., Zander gets an extra help card, Willow gets extra research card).  The game board also is rather interesting while staying true to Sunnydale.  The only complaint I have is the game offers much more interesting choices when you play the good characters.  Playing the evil characters is never quite as interesting as you just use a "pool" of cards for everybody.  Also the game can drag a little at times.  If you are a fan of the TV show, you really do need to try this game.

RATING: 6
I was hesitantly invited to join in a game (hesitantly because they were afraid the media tie-in name would scare me off), and I excitedly joined after hearing some good about it from the 'Geek. And it's not bad. If I didn't have better one evil vs. four good games to compare it to (such as Last Night on Earth), I might have thought more of it. But it just didn't really pop for me. This might be due to the fact that the Evil guy was the only one who'd played and our game felt accordingly pretty misbalanced and frustrating. I also think that someone who is more devoted to the series would get more from the game--I'd seen Season One and that was it when I played this, and so I had no idea what most of the cards were referring to, and thus didn't get much nostalgia value out of it. There were some fun and interesting points to it--the Moon mechanic was interesting and would have been more fun if not for the fact that we could barely ever get it to advance and whenever we did the Evil Master would turn it back to the beginning, so Oz barely ever got to slash around as a Werewolf and we didn't ONCE get to make it daytime. But it overall felt a bit lackluster for me. I'd play again if asked, and I hope that maybe other scenarios than the Season One could make it more interesting, but as it stands I wasn't terribly impressed.

Surprisingly good game considering that 1) it's a TV show tie-in and 2) it's from a major US company.  Such a good game, in fact, that it got me hooked on the TV series--which I suppose is what a tie-in game is ideally designed to do.  Wish there were more scenarios available though.  I'm surprised that there aren't more of them out there on the web ...

RATING: 6
Much more fun than you would expect from a Hasbro produced, TV show themed game.  I highly recommend it, especially for Buffy fans.  However, I strongly recommend a house rule to let characters move through enemies - otherwise vampires tend to always meet their end by getting trapped outside in the sun blocked on all sides.

House rules:
* You can move through an opponent, but they get a free attack if you do so.
* Mark each circle when a card is drawn from it (we use clear flat tokens).  That space may not be used again.  At sunrise, clear all the tokens.
* Weapons that inflict extra damage only cause the bonus damage if the attacker rolls at least one hit.

Buffy the Vampire Slayer is probably my all-time favorite show, so as soon as I got into board gaming I sought this one out. Of course, it's woefully out of print, but a certain someone forked over the money for a great birthday surprise. The game definitely lives up to its hype: a Milton-Bradley which is actually fun! I adore this game, and it's particularly great for story-telling when you know the show. The characters really seem to fit, too. For instance, our Xander always, always dies. I just wish there were more scenarios. But the combat is surprisingly fun, and the gameplay is thrilling and always provides a lot of laughter and cursing. Of course, it's a Milton-Bradley and the components aren't quality; you do a lot of rolling and moving. But for what it is, it's decidedly more fantastic than you'd think.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
It's a fun game, though I find myself thinking of things I wished they had done differently with the theme (Demon Kathy?  Really?  And the Judge over Angelus?) and the mechanics rather than accepting it for what it is.  I'll probably appreciate it more the more I play it.  One thing I do think this game really needs to capture the TV series (plus prevent any lulls in the action) is include a bunch of generic vampires and demons to run around Sunnydale and cause havoc for the Scoobies (perhaps as encounters when they draw cards).

UPDATE: I just had a GREAT game that came right down to the wire.  Buffy is no match for Demon Kathy and Veruka!  I also came to respect the simplicity of the roll-and-move rules.  The only other game I've played that is as capable of delivering a strong narrative while keeping the rules so simple and accessible is HeroQuest.  They're basically family games for nerds, which I'm sure I'll appreciate having in my games library when I have kids.

UPDATE 2: It was a mistake to trade this.  I hope to get another copy sometime.

UPDATE 3: Yay!  I got another copy!

UPDATE 4: Aaaaand I donated my copy to a charity auction.

I am not a Buffy fan. I have never watched a show. I think that genuinely detracts from the joy of playing this one.

That said, it is a fine game and while the roll-and-move mechanic is clunky (it almost always is) there are some reel decisions to make. The game is balanced and the scenarios are truly varied.  Clearly some real game design went on with this.

But, because the theme is so intimately tied with gameplay and because I am not a fan of Buffy I miss the atmosphere and references that would almost surely make this one more enjoyable. 




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 1

Meh. The Mayor scenario is extremely luck-dependent (the good guys won it on the first round, which is admittedly an edge case, but still). In the Adam scenario, it seems as if proper play for the good guys is to have everyone stock up on cards, run up and smack Adam, then run away to get healed and restock. The Master scenario appears much the same except that Buffy can't do much of the smacking. This all takes too long for what it is.

Hated the TV series. Ameritrash at it's finest. [i]The[/i] numero [gameid=2223] family game to break out for Halloween (and much funner than [gameid=699], IMHO) - cheaper too. Perfect for two or three players, or the full compliment of four... get a copy now. Got it here, a couple years ago and it was worth [i]every[/i] penny.., and if you're not into Buffy (like me) it's still good, Last Night on Earth? I don't see the similarity, but this tops it (unless you mod it, like we do) - They're both played on a table.
[microbadge=19747] +1 rating for fan'spansions.

Second copy (still in the original shrink)... getting a pit in my stomach, at the thought of selling it - what's happening to me? Damn! What would Buffy do? [b][color=red]SOLD[/color][/b]

Favorite quick tactical skirmish game. I cuss a lot when we play this. I have NEVER won. I still love it. A good choice when you just feel like kicking vampires in the head for about 45 minutes. Our best game was when Buffy and the Judge spent the entire game in Giles' apartment pounding on each other. We totally trashed Giles' apartment.

Just a couple plays, but a nifty looking game system.  Does a good job of balancing players in a 1-on-1 or a many-on-1 system as well.

The person teaching the game said that it helped to know more about the show to really get into it.  I guess so.  I don't know the show, and I felt like the game was a watered down blend of Fury of Dracula and Epic Duels.

Fun at first, but the replay value is a bit low.  You have to wait a while between playings or find people who haven't played before.

It's Buffy! It's rather simplistic but. It's BIG fun. The evil charcater plays all the baddies and the players take the roles of the 4 young characters from series' 2-4 (It's my game and I'm always Willow!, buffy isnt avery popular choice)

Bought a second copy of the game when they went on sale and combined it in the box with my first copy.  Wanted to experiment with a 2 vs 4 scenario and do some extra tinkering.  Not much ever came of it but at least I have spare parts for my original copy.  And no, I'm sorry, but you can't have them.

RATING: 7
Evil probably needs to avoid direct confrontation,  instead focusing staying away and using the minions.  It's a surprisingly good movie tie-in game - just expect to throw dice and draw cards.

RATING: 6
An ok game to play with the kids.  It has some fun value, but not a ton of depth.  Way too much dice rolling.

A really good two-player chase game.  (Even multiplayer is really two-player, given table talk.)

While some artifacts can trip the scales, the game is well balanced between the two sides.

RATING: N/A
Complete and in very good condition, some of the pieces still sealed in original bags.  The box is also very good, with only minor wear.

RATING: 2
The two hours I spent playing this would have been better spent pulling my toenails out with pliers.  The game is extremely unbalanced, both between the two "sides" and the individual characters.  Many of the cards you can draw are useless in most situations, and there's a lack of depth or variety.  "Oh boy, I just drew my 10th variation on a wooden stake!"  Give me Talisman, or HeroQuest, or even Lord of the Rings over this crap.

This is only rated a 2 because I have since played the "Lost" boardgame.

A lighter 1 vs many game set in the Buffy universe. If you know someone who's a big fan of this show and you want to get them into this style of game, this would be a good entry point.

Played once, and really don't need to again. Pretty typical licensed crap, although far from the worst I've played in that category.

I thought it would be a cooperative game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As above... I like all things Buffy.  One player is the Bad guys and the other players are Buffy, Xander, Willow, or Oz.  A bit of a dice fest but well balanced and filled with Buffy awesomeness.  This would come out more if my regular group were Buffy fans (most are not).

RATING: 6
Not great, but not bad either. It helps if you are a fan. Lacks a bit of something, but still a fun romp.

I only played this once, and Buffy was killed right away - I'm sure we did something wrong.

Very fun game.  The high rating is due to the fact that it is a game that my wife asks me to play (normally I have to ask her to play a game).

RATING: 6
Better than the TV show, if only because of the lack of endless, grating one-liners.

Good dice fest hidden under the theme. BTW, extremely good theme and very consistent with the TV show. There are several fan made expansions for the later TV seasons.

OK, so I'm a Buffy fan, guilty as charged. At least this is a good TV tie-in, looks good too. Not enough Cordelia though...

Not only a great board game, but a nice adaptation of the show, and that's a rarity for games based on TV shows. Can be easily played and enjoyed by non-fans of the show.

Bought this in about 2001, and played it a huge amount in subsequent years, and enjoyed it a lot. Haven't played it as much in recent years, but I still enjoy it now and then.

The luck of the draw and especially the dice play a large part, but your decisions matter too, and it's just great fun, especially if you're a fan of the TV show -- though you certainly don't have to be.

RATING: 1
Cheesy fun that aspires to join the awesomely bad pantheon spearheaded by Minion Hunter but fails because the broken mechanics aren't even as amusing or varied. Starting positions obligate certain maneuvers, e.g. the minion Adam has little reason not to high-tail it over to Xander and crush his life bar. When he runs next turn, if you can't chase him down (blind 2d6 roll-off, basically) then hustle back and grab the artifact that sits right next to you. Buffy crushes henchmen with relative ease but aside from Willow her cohorts are godawful; Xander has pathetic HP, no Fight, and only attempts to shuttle Helpers to other people, which is difficult to say the least when these individuals who have no real chance in combat against spend most of their time running, while the werewolf Oz does even less because his loyalty and items are so ephemeral. Evil should win this every time, really, the Goods are quite fragile and their moves are inefficient, but the worst offense is that people's options are so limited. (Willow, research, Xander, helpers, Buffy, weapons/henchmen) Add X points if you've seen the show, probably.

a much better game than you might expect, and one of the few games out there with cooperation as a core component. nice pieces, simple rules, fairly good replay value. and fun, to boot.

Fun for buffy fans. A li'l bit of the ole' heroquest with the adventuring and the dice rolling. expansions to cover all the seasons - and maybe angel would've been pretty keen.

Not a terrible game, but really not all that great either.  The whole Buffy thing does nothing for me, but I can see fans digging it, and it does have some clever aspects.

RATING: 6.5
Pretty much your basic roll and move, hack and slash dungeon crawler.  Collect items and spells then gang up on the big bad.  A pretty faithful adaptation of the show and since I like Buffy a lot, I can see myself playing this if it's suggested.  Not a bad game at all.

What a spin off game that is quite good?  limited replay value though nice bits!

RATING: 8.5
ALERT: I am a huge Buffy fan, thus am predisposed to like this game.  That said, the game play is surprisingly involved for a game based on a TV series.  It's not a roll and move type game like you might expect.  Some thought went into this.

This game is a lot more fun than you would expect. It's a bit fiddly, and I think there are a couple weird card interactions that can break the game for one team or the other, but overall it's balanced enough to get enjoyment out of.

The theme is very well implemented, and it's nice to have a DM vs. party design to play with.

I really like this game. The number of different scenarios and the strategic gameplay allow the game immense replay value. One player controls the Big Bad and his minions while the other players take on the role of the Scoobies. The rules are easy to follow and the rulebook is beautifully presented (as is the whole game). It&#039;s a pity there are no official expansions for seasons 5, 6 and 7.

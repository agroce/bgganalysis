This game has a sob story. One year it was my "gift from Santa Claus". Unfortunately my (younger) brother (now happiest_wookie) was with my mom when she bought it and he remembered this. He spent the whole Christmas day crying about this discovery.

Yeah, it's one of those party-type games that a dozen people can play (although the package only supports a lesser number). It's right up there with the Dictionary game - not something I long for, but will find myself playing when surrounded by non-gamers who want some word-y fun. I'll never suggest it, but will tolerate a play of it.

PARTY

A fun game in which you need to generate words associated with various categories. The catch is they must all start with the same letter that's determined at the beginning of the turn. Produces a lot of groans as everyone shares their answers.

Thrift store find.

Recommended with 2-6+ players (best 4-6). 30 mins.

RATING: 4
I hate party games but this is the most tolerable of a bad bunch. 

At least you're doing something that requires some thought when you are naming things in a category. The drawback is that other players can evaluate answers, so you need to play with reasonable people.

First off, I'm pretty good at this game, so if I weren't, my rating would be lower.
PATHETIC! Dry and boring. I question whether it can be called a word game, since it's really more of a trivia game. Word game or trivia game, it is one of the worst games I have ever played. And if you happen to like the concept, don't waste your money on buying a copy (even at the thrift store, where there are always unending dumped copies of it): you could VERY easily make your own version of the game on a Sunday afternoon.
Never again...............

Another fairly common party game.  This one suffers from the "An elephant is NOT a farm animal!" problem, so if anyone is too competitive or confrontational, this game quickly becomes a mess.  

It does come with that cool alphabet die, though....

The basic concept has potential, but it doesn't really work because what is or is not a valid answer is way too ambiguous.

It could be argued that the game is about playing to the discernment of the rest of the game group.  But that has little appeal to me.  They're your opponents, they have an interest to vote you down, particularly if you are leading.

lots of fun, highly replayable, great family game.  the average rating on this game is 5.99 as i type, which isn't a bad representation given the anti-party/classics people around bgg.  a steal for $10 shipped from amazon with a copy of guesstures thrown in.  the negotiation elements in selling or debating answers should be mentioned more with this one, including ensuing arguments!  some of those stories last decades.

The fun of this game depends HEAVILY upon who's playing.  If you're with rules lawyers, you spend an inordinate amount of time arguing over whether answers are acceptable.  Others try to bluff their answers as being correct ("Is a thermocline something cold?")  I'd rather play an actual bluffing game, like Beyond Balderdash.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I still love this one as a party game.  However someone that is going to 'challenge' every answer (especially the humourous but still true answers) can really suck the fun out of it.  Definitely needs at least 4 players to enjoy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The biggest issue with the game is the inherent ambiguity in what constitutes a right and wrong answer. But this game wasn't designed for competitive gamers... it's a whimsical word game that plays quickly and creates a great deal of tension.

RATING: 6
A party game that gets trotted out every so often.  Some players love it, some try to get too creative, some endure it, and some hate it.  If the dendrites aren't firing that particular evening, you may spend the whole time just staring at your list, and crossing off the obvious choices for a category.  Other times, ideas may fly through your head at a fast and furious pace.  Your enjoyment will depend on which side of the fence you are on at that particular time. Occasional plays are okay.

This is my favorite party game (My ranking is based on what it is... a party game)... it is challenging in large groups, funny (as long as you dont play with a bunch of dead beats) and highly replayable. I have enjoyed this game my whole life. It can be played sober or ... less than sober. Is this game going to challenge you like a puerto rico, dominion, war of the ring? No. But it is not that type of game. It sets up in minutes, can be learned in under one minute, goes quick and is fun. If you don't want to commit to a long strategic game, this is a great choice.

Scattergories is an average party game.  It would be better but it can get repetitive after a few games, and players frequently try to bend the "no adjectives" rule.  Also if you choose to play a full game based on the rules explanation, it can drag on for way too long.  Playing about 3 cards (one answer sheet) is usually enough.

It's usually fun when we play, but there is always a discussion about what words are acceptable.  So many people use adjectives to describe something else so that they can get points that it leads to issues in this game.  For example, "Frozen Ice" for 'Things that are cold' with the letter 'F'.

This game is really a contest between people who have the very particular mental advantage of being able to call to mind examples of a particular category by the first letter of the word - pitted against those who will make insistent arguments that their word entries might bend but not break the rules of the game (I'm more the latter, to my shame). There might be a few laughs, but this one really isn't much fun. People play this who haven't had the opportunity to try better games; I used to be one of those people.

My family owned this game when I was a teenager, and it got passed down to my husband and I.  With an English teacher for a Mother, I was always itching to beat her at word games.  (Which I consistently did whenever we played Scattergories.)  So, I probably like this game better than I should.

This is quite a fun little wordgame -- but I <i>cannot</i> bear the noise of that timer!  Also, I win too often, which ain't much fun for everyone else.  I'm a bit too good at wordgames, so I rarely ever play them; it's too difficult not to be smug, and that's just unfair.  On the other hand, I'd consider owning it for the aplhabet d20 alone (I collect funky dice).

A fun game I've historically played with pads, pens and selecting a random letter from the page of book. (Everyone in the circle just makes up the categories beforehand). Was introduced to the concept as a "proper" board game recently, and it's an equally fun way to spend a but of time unwinding.

Not a bad party-type game, but it always invites too much controversy, which means you have to be strangely explicit about what is and isn't "acceptable".

Love playing this game with the family, though it gets old kind of quickly so it's a "few times a year" game. I still remember having the letter 'F', and the category was "things you keep hidden". My sister wrote "freaks" which I thought was great. She was out-voted by the other players however.

I really don't like this game at all, but it's one of my wife's favorites. I'll play it with her maybe one out of five times that she asks me. I'm just not great at thinking of words and phrases in the time limit. And that timer!!! Now, there is a "love to hate" relationship with the timer. I've heard that new versions of the game have a digital timer, and that seems like it's not even the same game without the analog noisy timer.

This is as close to my personal hell in boardgame form as you can get. Firstly, it's a word game, which I'm wretchedly bad at despite my fondness for reading. Secondly, many of the categories are completely beyond my knowledge, which doesn't make coming up with words any easier. Like Scrabble, I often struggle to come up with words, unlike Scrabble, I can't even put up a fight in this game, averaging perhaps 4 answers out of 12 questions per round. Not my type of game at all.

Another of the better family - party games. You have different cards each with about 10 categories on them. You then roll a die which has the more common letters on it.

Components: All components are functional. The oversized die and timer are both cool. Comes with a generous supply of score cards.

Experience: Lots of fun to brainstorm words, to see what others come up with, and (most importantly) to lobby for the admission of my questionable word. This game more than any other party game I've played leads to intense and interesting discussions about language.

Has been replaced by Scattergories Categories, which serves the same purpose, but is more fun to brainstorm a single category.

A popular game amongst the non-gamers in my family (the rules can be learned in under a minute) and endless source of debate over the validity of specific answers.

* Can be more frustraiting than fun at times and peoples answers for the most part won't create any laughter or amusement.
* The scoring while fine in concept feels a bit broken to me.

Playing with just 2 players isn't as fun, but it gets better with more.  It also helps if you have the right players.  Last time I played this with my wife, we got this:

Her answer: Sidney Poitier

I love my wife!!

One of the better party games out there.  Also, the only game so far that we've managed to get El Hidalgo's wife to play!

[many more than 4 plays] Endless fun to be had in this quick game of memory and linguistic ingenuity.  Some complain about the ambiguity of the rules, but I don't think it's that difficult to establish house rules on what's legal and what's not.  We just follow the rules of the game, and vote on borderline cases.  Not as hard and fast a system as a Scrabble dictionary, but we aren't playing at tournament level, or tournament style.  I play to win, but am not that strict, and I just don't find the element of subjective judgment to be a problem.

"The Game of Scattergories," published in 1988 by Milton Bradley, is a great game for any group to play. In the game each player fills out a category list 'with answers that begin with the same letter.' If no other player matches your answers, you score points. The game is played in rounds. After 3 rounds a winner is declared, and a new game can be begun.

Great party game for adults and older teenagers.  Good for a larger group setting.  It is a word game (though a very light one, and certainly not to the extent of games like Scrabble), but it is not for everyone, and those who are not academically inclined might enjoy it less.  Another drawback is the potential for [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/340832]arguments[/url] over borderline words (decided by a vote).  Nonetheless most people are willing to play and enjoy the game.

You can also play with this more fun variant inspired by the similar game [gameid=177877] (which I reviewed [thread=1562401]here[/thread]: 
[thread=1562948][/thread]

Also owned: [gameid=17709], A party game with some similarities to Scattergories, only worse - players compete to be the last one to say a word in a category before a timer goes off.  Potential for yelling and arguing over whether words are legitimate.  See [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/237816]Tom Vasel's review[/url].

I freaking love scattergories!! I have the original 1989 version, which I think is the best.  I like the paper holders better, and I just think its a better quality.  Anyway, The problem is its kind of a thinking game, and I dont think that great for parties.  I think its best with 4 players. Ive played with my husband from time to time, and he just cant take it seriously.  Its very subjective, and if you dont like the answer, a fight can break out quite easily.

[Original comment] Fun game with the right group of players. We have actually worn out the original timer and use a sand timer now. It has become a favorite game of our 11-year old granddaughter.

May 2009 -- Our granddaughter is the only family member who specifically requests to play this game. In fact, our son essentially refuses to play it, so we only get it out occasionally when he is not present for a game day. It's an okay game, but I would prefer Facts in Five anytime.

This is actually my favourite party game, though I know many people would rather punch themselves in the nose than play it.

A near perfect game of intense debates and semantics.  The only flaw this game has is sometimes the categories can be too easy, too hard, or too specific to a player's knowledge.  The difficulty curve for some players is very high as well.  That being said, it is a must-play.

Scattergories is one of those games that is usually only fun to play if you are good at thinking of things when you need to under pressure, and then it's only fun to play with other people who are also good at it. It's not a game you can make the best of if you aren't doing well so you either like it or you don't. Because of this, I rarely play it and when I do, I play it 10 times in a row with the 2 people who I know who actually like it.

RATING: 6.5
This game can be fun with the right crowd and with folks in the right mood. It seems to be more fun with more people. Some of the categories are sorta weird... "street name" for example. You can just make up something for that, can't you? The categories where there seem to be some logical limits to what you can write seem a little better. The most fun is when the answers get creative, but still plausible.

This was one of my favorites before I discovered the next generation of board games that have emerged in the past decade. It's still a good one, especially if my parents want to join in (they're not interested in most of the more complex/Euro-style games). But unless I was playing with them I'd probably never think to play it.

An excellent family game, and it suits our family perfectly, because two of us are wordy and the other two like to think they are. Lots of replayability, which is never a bad thing. 
My only niggle is that if there's any decision over whether an answer is valid or not, it's almost never allowed, because it would go against the other players' interests. I can't really think of a better way to decide, but as is, it always ends up being the loudest player's choice.

First, a timed word puzzle.  But then, after the timer buzzes, hilarity results from questioning and defending odd, doubtful, or stretched answers.  Best with 6+ people who are not too uptight.

Advice: It is imperative to encourage and then require all players to vote -- with a thumbs up or down, simultaneously at the count of three -- on a challenged answer, rather than "politely" not wanting to have a "confrontational" vote against someone.  Once they get over that reluctance, all goes well.

The idea is fine, but the lack of real rules about what is an acceptable answer is a problem. You'll either find yourself in a group that winds up arguing over every answer, or one that lets everything count because no one wants to tell someone their answer is no good.

A vegetable starting with Y:
 1) yellow corn
 2)yellow squash
 3) yellow zucchini also called yellow squash
 4) yucky overcooked mushy green peas
 5) young carrots (baby carrots)

Tiresome exercise in the end.

It's a very enjoyable word game where people compete to come up with the most original list of answers, but the words must all begin with a randomly generated letter at the start of each round.  It is a fun and challenging, and rarely do I find someone who doesn't really like this game.

RATING: 2
There's something about me where I just can't come up with words on the fly and so any game where you HAVE to do that, like Scrabble, I detest with a passion. If I play this it's only because you asked nicely and I really don't want to act like a spoiled whiny little brat. Although the next time I'm asked I probably will resort to that if I have to. 

The only good thing I can say about Scattergories is that everyone seems to at least come close to sucking at it as much as me so I don't feel so bad. If it weren't for that I'd probably write the developers of it a really nasty letter and mail it with that ticking time bomb timer making sure it was ticking when they came to the box.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
My family's favorite board game for a good few years, so I have a lot of fun memories of this growing up.  Once I tried to cash in on the alliterative bonus by submitting, for the category "Reasons for Being Late", the response "Mom Mad Many Monday Mornings".  This line, laughed down by everyone, is STILL referenced in my family more than a decade later.A good game of free-association and second-guessing.  I don't think it's GREAT, though, because they could have provided you with something like 100 Lists rather than the 12 they give you (and which eventually become tiresome).  Also, if you're not in the right mood, trying to think of all those words can feel like more of a chore than fun.

Scattergories, although amusing at times, usually degenerates into a big fight. Here are some simple examples:
-- Can "toes" be found on the beach?
-- Is "tiny toes" two points?
-- If I have "tiny toes" and another player has "toes" do we both get points?
-- And so on...

Couple this with the fact that I can not beat my brother at this game, means it does not get played very often.

That said, the alphabet die is pretty cool!

A decent word game, if you like words. The trouble is that you spend most of the time trying to convince the others that "Big, Bouncy, Balls" isn't worth 3 points, when the answer should just be "Balls" for 1 point, for example.
If you're not hung up on scoring and winning, though, it's fun.

Surprisingly, the categories don't seem to get stale, probably because 1) I play so infrequently and 2) you change the letter every round.  So you might only match up "Card 1" and the letter "D" once out of 20 times you play.  Not such a bad idea.  If it starts to get old, picking up the refill ( = new categories) will help!

Anyway, a good party game for people who enjoy word games.  I can always be talked into Scattergories when I'm at a friend's house.

An enjoyable light party game; I wish it had slightly more depth. The simple mechanics do hide some fun challenges, though -- like deciding whether or not to angle for only writing down a few words, but picking words that are obscure enough that they're guaranteed to score points.

For some reason, whenever we consider breaking out Scattergories we always have too many people to play it with the included bits; I wish it came with more screens and so forth.

Ok...  I like this game; HOWEVER, I can't give it a higher score than six for a few reasons.  First, the game starts to feel more like I'm taking a test than playing a game.  After a few rounds, my brain just decides that it doesn't want to fit perfectly good answers into a three minute time interval.  Scrabble has the same feeling but at least doesn't have the a time interval involved.  Second, the ridiculous answers are funny for a little while; but wind up becoming just a stretch to see if someone can score double or triple points with alliteration...  Still, the game is pretty accessible to everyone and can handle up to six.  So, it does have its uses.  But, As the only game of the night -- which may happen with people who haven't been introduced to the geek -- it can get a little stale and feel more like work than fun.  Would actually put this at a 5 if it offered fewer people.

RATING: 5
02/08/2013: This is one of those "classic" family / party games we've gotten plenty of times to the table over the years.  It was one of our standard go-to games before I got into hobby board games.  All players are given the same category card and random starting letter with which all of your answers must begin.  Everyone writes as many of the answers as they can in the time limit; compare the answers with everyone playing; the player with most unique answers wins the round.  Play as long as you like.

This is a solid family / party game as it scales well for any number of players, really.  Depending on how serious you stick to "basic" answers like Ball compared to how we like to play, Bob's Bouncing Ball, could add additional fun and enjoyment to the game.

Fun party game; but the sometimes vague categories [street name, for example] leave things too open-ended and up for objection. It also leads to problems when you are with people who are less-informed.  One example was when I wrote down "Flywheel" as a car part that starts with F.  The others wanted to vote it down because they hadn't heard of it.

These old school games don't necessarily fit my definition of boardgame play in its current form, but I include this because this game is pure childhood nostalgia and created a love of dice rolling and card play and maps without the boon of electricity. 

It's a party game that lives well in the non-gamer social setting. Although I'd rather play many other games, this is one I will play rather than play nothing at all.

Used to love this back when I was younger, but it has worn thin.

Usually because people think its neat to get creative and Big Blue Blown-Up Beach Ball or Bright Blue Beach Blanket as an item you'd see at the beach, when adding endless adjectives irritates the crap out of me.

If played correctly though, it's a fun party game.

This is a great little party game that has seen repeated play with gamer's and non gamers alike. For me the joy is not so much in getting the best score with straight answers to each category. It's all about having had one to many beers or wines and trying to justify your 'absurd answer' with ridiculous links and lines of argument!

My opinion of this game has significantly dropped recently. I've always enjoyed the exercise of coming up with words in certain categories that start with the same letter - however this game is truly flawed when it comes to scoring. It's far too wishy washy in terms of what should count and what shouldn't, and there's no incentive NOT to challenge someone's answer, so the game just turns into one giant argument.

A great party game. Hysterical laughter always ensues, upping its value in my eyes. The combination of the 12 disparate cattegories per card and the timer make this a sure-fire brain-twister of epic and humorous proportions. Try it out. Or, try it again.

RATING: 5
Luxurious packaging of a party game otherwise in the public domain, that can be very much enjoyed during one party but that shouldn't be played too often (after favourite words appear the game will just be repetitive). The categories have been chosen tastefully and the allowed time is well-adjusted.

Another great Christmas standby. Has helped the clan through many a Queen's Speech. People who criticise this have missed the point: the whole enjoyment of the game derives from challenging each other's frivolous words.

This is fun, and good exercise for the little gray cells, but not something I'd want to spend a lot of time playing. For one thing, it makes me feel like a complete idiot! Amazing how being under pressure makes your mind go blank.  When you hear the answers of other players for categories you left blank, you are astounded that you didn't think of the same thing. The components are adequate, but the gigantic die was too big for me to jiggle around in my hand before tossing as I like to do.(3+3)

It's a pastime, but everyone sitting quietly trying to think of things under time pressure is not a party game. Without the expectation of laughs and conversation, there's little point pulling it out, except maybe to teach the kids and let them play with their friends. It was derived from kids playing the categories game anyway so I'll be avoiding it and let it reside in the kid's cupboard.

Finally, a word game that I like!  Own game sans timer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not a terrible game. Given a starting letter you have to come up with an example for each of 12 categories that nobody else chooses. For a light-hearted game, you actually have to think a lot. And there is no social interaction while the timer is running.

I haven't seen the rules, but as a precision-oriented person, it bothered me that a valid answer to "Things at a football game" starting with "W" might be "White Shirts". The ambiguity means you'll need to reach group consensus on whether to allow or disallow answers, which is fine in some groups, but could be a problem in others.

This really needs to be played in a party setting and in a relaxed atmosphere. Group play is best as you try and determine words starting with the letter give to fit in each category. You may also need a judge as the rules state that you can be original, but arguments will occur and an impartial judge is key to keeping it fun and light. Party games are not really my favorite but this one I can deal with once in a while.

Scattergories is a pretty fun game, despite the occasional hemming and hawing over the whether an answer is actually valid.  I like trying to find obscure answers, and it's amusing when multiple people come up with the same obscure answer.  I do wish there were more than 12 lists, though.

It's all fun and games until you get into a fight over whether or not Ken Jennings is an historical figure. Not only is he still not an historical figure, but he definitely was not 5 years ago when this fight occurred. That aside, this game is hilarious, frustrating and really makes you think. There are so many opportunities to be clever and I love that!

Awesome game that my non-gamer friends will not play.

Some faults, though:
1. The timer is incredibly annoying; the new electric one is worse.
2. I haven't played this one often, but repeated plays will probably kill this one, since there aren't that many category cards.
3. Petty arguing when there's a disputed answer

Only problem is how many people accept just about any word - it's difficult to get an accepted rule for what is acceptable and what isn't. Whether your word is accepted or not turns into how convincing or favored you are.
If it wasn't for this major flaw (which gets more annoying and unavoidable every time I play it) it would be an 8 as a party game.

This is a game that I played with my mother and grandmother as a child.  I didn't know as many words, but was inventive, so it usually evened out.

Scattergories is fun because it requires out of the box thinking.  It also works best when you know the people that you are playing with, so that you will try not to say the things that you think they will say.

A fun idea.  Pick a letter and think of word for each of many categories.  The problem is that for most categories, there are so many different possible words.  So, it's mostly about just thinking about something for each category instead of finding good unique words.

Great idea for a party game here.  The problem I have with the game is how it encourages players to be "too creative."  Stretching the category idea to create something that is an alliteration for the bonus points happens pretty frequently.  Then the players have to be hardliners to reign in that type of play, and no one wants to be that person especially during a party game.

Players write down words in different cattegories that have to start with a certain letter.  There's always discussions about the existence of words, so declare a dictionary as the "official" and keep it close.  Nice way to spend some time if you have nothing better to do.

Admittedly, this is simply a public domain game ([b]Categories[/b]) with a $25 price tag and its name changed to [b]Scattergories[/b]... so there is no real reason for this game's existence as anyone can play it with just paper and pencil.

That being said, the game itself is quite fun and recommended as a word-based party game.

I suck at this game. I'm plain awful. Scattergories requires you to quickly come up with words or phrases that fit within a given category starting with a particular letter. My brain just doesn't work this way. I struggle to come up with examples for the 12 categories within the time limit. I can see how there is strategy, but that's too advanced for me. How I can do well at Scrabble but suck wind here is puzzling. Not my favorite party game.

Additionally, the rules are fairly weak and subjective. Play this in a group of like-minded folks to save you some arguments and agony. I personally think a "red blender" is not a kitchen appliance starting with R, but I'm outvoted...

UPDATE Sep-4-2009: Wow, I totally forgot how atrociously awful I am at this game. This game might be tolerable with another group; being last is no so bad, but these folks like to stretch the limits of believability with their answers. Maybe I'm just a sore loser? It's a distinct possibility! Regardless, I hate this game even stronger than before. But it's funny, because it SEEMS like this is exactly the kind of word/party game I would love. Ah well. Dropping rating from 5 to 3.5, and the .5 is a gift from my optimist side.

This perennial thrift store mainstay is a neat little party game: players are given word lists and a die (HUGE 20 sided alphabet one!) is rolled.

Players then quickly fill out the answers on their word list using words starting with the letter rolled. EG: Letter rolled was C. Question: Girl's name. Answer: Charlotte.

The neat twist: players only score for words NOT picked by opponents. Fast playing and good fun.

The trick to liking this game is to ignore the stated goal (thinking of an appropriate word that starts with a given letter) and instead come up with highly inappropriate words and spend the next 10 minutes arguing passionately for the acceptance of your word.  Given a series of suitably whacked-out answers (the raunchier the better), hilarity is virtually guaranteed.

I've always enjoyed this party game.  It's funny how when you're not playing coming up with something for any category and any of the 20 letters used in the game isn't that difficult but once you're playing your mind can go completely blank.

There's only a small number of different categories and you can go through them all in one game but mixing it up with 20 different letters provides enough variety this game hasn't yet felt repetitive (we only play very occasionally also).

I love that this is the first game I can remember where they made dealing with disputes so easy.  Just take a vote!

Another game I've never played properly. After playing an all-verbal version on a cruise ship, I picked up the game at a thrift shop to play with my students. Other than using a few cards as topic inspirations, we ended up playing all-verbal versions, too. I'm don't think the official boxed set is necessary for most people - just Google up the rules. (It's not like Werewolf where you might get a boxed version just for the pretty art or expandable ideas.)

I used to really enjoy this little party game, but after several years the excitement has pretty much died out.  Although I didn't often play it "properly", instead finding more fun in spending the majority of my time in each round trying to come up with the longest phrase using words starting with the same letter for a single answer.  Also, my wife always kicked my butt at this game, which is fine of course, because I was having fun.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6/10

The real fun in Scattergories comes not from playing the game, but arguing over the legality of each player's answers.  That's an odd place to find entertainment, but it works.  The actual word-finding portion of the game (theoretically, the game itself) is solitary and a bit frustrating.

It can be pretty fun seeing the insanity desperate people try to get away with, then subsequently have the group argue the merit. All in a good natured way of course.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 4.5

If I catch hate for loving this game, so be it. 

I really enjoy the process of sitting down and making associations. Boys name that starts with a U. Hmmm. Umar, if you go by some transliterations! Or Ube! Wooo! Thinking is fun! We're not talking about deep strategy or number crunching here, just light, fluid, creative thought. 

But when you take that mechanic and throw in other people doing the same thing and then throw in that if you answer the same thing as something else neither of you get a point... well, now that's more interesting to me. I bet I can come up with more than you, and I bet mine will be weirder, because, well, I'm weird. It rewards thinking differently and sharing that with others. I love hearing someone's answer that works for the item in question and appreciating how I would have never thought of that and I likewise enjoy having a great idea come to mind. Especially if you play with the extra points for multiple first letter hits rule: Donald Duck for cartoon character starting with D gets 2 points instead of 1, but Hunter Hearst Helmsley for hero or boy's name (or fictional character or what) have you starting with H is 3 points and even less likely someone else thought of it. Now there's a simple, yet really fun and engaging party or family game to me.

OK, so it's like playing multi-player solitaire because everyone sits in silence. But, the part that makes this a great party game is the discussion and arbitration. It's not just coming up with answers, or even the best answers for the most points that you are sure no one else will also think of, but it's about coming up with inventive, creative answers that then get contested and debated! State beginning with Z? Everyone is empty handed and then it comes to you and you smirk and shout out "ZIMBABWE!". "That's not a state!!" the others snarl, and you quickly retort that it is a nation-state and fits the definition of state in a wider sense and since the card didn't specify "US State", it is rather ethnocentric of them to assume that's what it means. HAH! Awesome! Then you'll have people reaching farther, harder, anything to get the points. The justifications begin to become more and more hilarious and spirited. That's something I love for a party game, because I'm a debater and a philosopher at heart.

Scattergories yields a good dose of fun as well as frustration, all whilst under pressure.

Fun,  in that it is simply an enjoyable affair - and frustration in the "Why didn't I think of that" department,  that you will experience upon every reveal.

This is a very fun game if everyone playing is into it. If not, then you have people not even trying to get words for each category and the scoring goes by quickly. It's not at all easy to think of words on the clock like this, but the tension is part of the fun for me.

RATING: 6
Classic word/party game. The enjoyment you'll get depends strongly on your company. On one hand, people that vote against the slightest out-of-the-box answer are no fun, but neither are those who will write just about anything and clammer and whine if people recognize that it's just too "out there." Find a balance, though, and you get a good game allowing for some creativity and rewarding some very basic general knowledge and letter sense.

The basic idea behind this game- have a bunch of catergories, and try to find unique entries for said catergories in a few chosen letters, is the basis behind probably my favorite party game, one that I would rate on its own as at least a 9.

But you don't need the contents of this box to play that- come up with your own categories instead.

Maybe I'm rating this one a bit high because of how much I have played it (a LOT). It's a thinking persons game with a time limit so it's definitely not for everybody. Because it's timed you can really play as quick as just one 2 minute round. Or you'll probably want to play more to try and improve upon your failures of the last round. My favorite party game to play when  you have a ton of people of varying ages and interests in gaming.

We modify the scoring a little to play with my daughter with Down Syndrome. She comes up with some great answers, just not enough of them. We let her score everything she writes (unless we disallow it), but if anyone duplicated her answers, they can't count it. Also we triple her score. That way it's competitive. It's one of her favorite games. We enjoy it, too.

RATING: 8
One of the better party games for more subdued crowds. In the versions I've played, the timer is obnoxious; why manufacturers think that a loud, irritating noise is appropriate for games that expect you to think is beyond me. The only major problem is that the lack of a "correct" answer can sometimes lead to people getting belligerent that their answer should count, ruining the atmosphere a bit. Having said all that, this has maybe the best metagame of any party game, and as such is much more entertaining with people you know reasonably well. Wouldn't be my top choice for a party game in my collection, but it's better than most I've played.

This light game can be fun with the right group of individuals, but I do not recommend it for adults.  There is a lot of downtime and unless you add some caffeine, houserules and/or new categories into the mix, this game can really kill a mood.  The components are nice and more functional than anything.

The one redeeming feature of this game is you can play it spread out across the room without everyone huddled around a table.

Always fun. Also fun to make your own categories.

Good game if playing with the right people and for short periods of time. Most of the time we will be ready for a change after two or three plays. More often than not, other games will get to the table before this one.

After 50+ Plays: The categories are too vague, leading to arguments over the answers, and someone not playing in the spirit of the game can really mess it up.  If the category is things in Las Vegas, should someone really be able to put "doors"?  Yes, there are doors in Las Vegas, but that kind of answering makes the game ridiculous.  Facts in Five has more definite categories and more interesting scoring.

I like Scattergories, and I'm awful at it. It's amazing how bad you can be at rattling off a series of words that meet the criteria and start with the same letter, but it's fun to do so.

Interesting concept that always, at least in my family, ends with a shouting fest. "Pencils aren't something found in a bathroom!" "Anything can be found in a bathroom that's smaller than a bathroom!" "But Pencils........."

The game focuses more on the social event than the mechanics itself, a worthy goal, but the subjective nature of scoring has raised unenjoyable issues more than once.

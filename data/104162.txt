A dungeon crawl that looks amazing but the mechanics and rules get in the way of the game being fun. It took around a week of watching rules videos, reading the actual rules, and looking at posts on BGG to even know how to play. When I finally knew how to play the game fell flat and the flow of play was constantly interrupted by flipping through the rules to find one of the 900 exceptions in a badly laid out rule set. I am however still interested in trying this more in the future.

I've only ever played as the DM/Overlord and really enjoy that side since there is zero downtime. And my wife loves playing as the hero(s) so it works.

It's a dice roller, but enough strategy to work your brain and quick enough that you can get several games in during one sitting.

RATING: 4.5
Was hyped to play it. Turns out it's not a dungeon crawl but a dungeon race. Instead of heroicly fighting monsters you're supposed to ignore them while they hit you and just run to square X in time.

The overlord doesn't send monsters to fight but to block the way for the heroes, so he can buy enough time to get to square Y.

Miserable line-of-sight rules.

Will try to get it played with house rules that heavily change (fix) the game.

When I first looked at I was underwhelmed. I run the demo at the local store and was fairly impressed. After starting the campaign I am hooked. This is excellent fun and my kids love it to, where as Descent 1 was to long and complicated for them.

This still feels a lot like Descent 1st Ed, but I like it better. 
It is streamlined, and although I don't usually like streamlined versions of games I think the trade off here is worth it. The only problem with 1st Ed was that I could never find anyone to sit for 4-8 hours and play it. I hated that it only hit the table once a year or so. My friends who liked 1st Ed all like this much better, and so do I.

Good solid game, the daddy of dungeon crawlers, I never played the previous edition and have played a few games on the 2nd, I love the variety of the missions and the fact that you play the campaign, component quality is 5 star (out of 5) but it takes a long time to setup sometimes it is overwhelming looking at all the components

First dungeon crawler I ever played. Instantly fell in love with it. Minis are great and even better when painted, a lot of content. I only played it coop either with RTL app or Redjak OL variant.  
The problem with playing with a human OL is too much downtime. Also the set up take quite some time if you don't invest in some storage solution to have everything at hand.

After giving a try to other games in the same genre, I had to change my rating from 8 to 9.

Descent is D&D after it has dropped the pretense that it has anything to do with role playing. It is all about the hack and slash on a board with beautiful production value. What isn't to like about Descent? It is a great dungeon crawl simulater where one player takes on the role of the GM and 4 others take on the role of an adventuring party on a quest. The game comes with plenty enough quests for a campaign and there is a lot of support for it. The only real drawbacks are that it requires more of a long term committment than I can reasonably expect from my regular game night which is more geared to multiple games every night and different ones each week and that it can take a toll to always be one player who does a lot of set up and prep work versus four others who are required to be invested over a long period of time. I've been playing around with the idea of having a home descent night for a campaign some time...

RATING: 8
I honestly enjoy this game a lot.  However, there's mechanic and balance issues depending on how many Hero characters are in play.  I think the game plays better with three or more of them.  With two, one wrong move and its either an easy win, or the Overlord can just mop the floor.  On the whole, a great game that I've managed to bring many non-gamers into.  Lots of fun!

We have started our first campaign!  Rating to come later, but the intro quest went well.

Update: I can't bring myself to rate this one above a 6.  We haven't actually finished our first campaign, but several times we seemed to be presented with [i]highly[/i] one-sided scenarios, which isn't very much fun.

Update: We never ended up going back to this one, and I don't imagine we ever will.  It was a great idea, but the lopsided scenarios killed it for us.

RATING: 9
This game improves on the first edition so heavily that I don't think I would be able to accurately describe it. It's faster to play, there's more depth to the heroes, the minis are more detailed, the Overlord can win without taking any of the fun away from the heroes, there are more mechanics and more varied winning conditions, the tiles are double sided with outside  locations so you're effectively getting 48 dungeon tiles and 48 forest tiles, and the game isn't weighed down with all the unnecessary things the first one was (like the set-up time - the tiles are numbered and lettered, there are no tokens for holes and rocks, and there's an easier way to keep track of money rather than piling up the coins). It's far superior and utterly replaced the first edition for me, PHENOMENAL game!

I've always liked Descent and thought that Descent 2 would be easier to get to the table with the shorter missions.  That didn't happen because the streamlining which made the game shorter actually ended up making the game less appealing to my son.  Anyway with the app's release I can play the game solo as well as introduce some Descent goodness to my younger son.  Glad to finally dust this game off and play!

FAVOURITE GAME - My old time favourite. The revamp of the original Descent: Journeys in the Dark dungeoncrawler. The mechanics is the same: an evil Overlord gives a lot of headaches to the questing heroes. The game features shorter scenarios, so you won't sit eight hours playing it. There are a few new rules, also new heroes and monsters.

RATING: 6
A decent dungeon crawler, but a bit too much work to set up and tear down, and isn't very streamlined.  Also, because maps are known ahead of time, no feeling of exploration.

Surprisingly, the co-op and single player variants are more enjoyable, because of the exploration element.

Don't hate me, only played it once.  Didn't see what all the fuss was about.  Heroquest is more fun to me; it was more about exploring and gaining treasure.  This was simply a tactical battle game.  Perhaps if I played it a few more times.

RATING: 8.2
Descent is one of the best miniature games I have ever played, where a group of players can band up against the Overlord player which can control some cool creatures like dragons etc. The theme is great, the miniatures are AWESOME and the fact that you have different scenarios, different skills to choose from, different items, different characters, different Overlord cards etc. offers you a great deal of variety.
Your characters do not have a lot of health, and a decent hit could consume half of your hit points in in an instance. This creates tension, you never know you will live the next turn (well technically, you don't die but are just knocked down). However, this brings along that combat can feel really swingy at times, and also too luck-based. One turn you are winning without question, the other you feel like crying and giving up. Although I like games where there is some mechanism to deal with a runaway leader problem, I think they overdid it with this one. Another problem is the set-up, which can take a long time. The disadvantages do not outweigh the advantages, but I can imagine people put off be this. Still a wonderful game!

Well, I've been postponing this comment for a long time, and the rate might have even been lower, but I'm trying to be as fair as possible and a lower rating would be due to the clash between expectation and reality that this game provoked. Explaining, a few years back (prior to my descovery of modern board games) we, my family and I, played Hero Quest and it was always an event for us (you can read about on my Hero quest Comment). When researching about this game, reading and watching reviews the expectatons went through the roof. It was one of the first games I bought, had to import it paying through the nose, fell in love with the components and when it hit the table it fell flat, we tried again but this time one of the players messed things up and it was a bad experience again. We will try it one more time (third time is the charm! isn't that what you people say?), I really believe that if we manage to overcame a couple quests the game will "click".

I've only played a little of the second scenario or whatever.

We camped a lot to heal up blocking the dragon with stun and then we killed the dragon and the archer and the boss ran out of the dungeon.

Fail :D

Took 1 hour before the game actually started with all the talk and the healing wasn't all that fun either. Would be more fun if people moved more quickly. I'll play again but what I think long-term depends on how swiftly it plays.

The base edition can be pretty boring for the Overlord as they have no possible way to win any encounter, even when using bizarre strategies. The game is NOT a dungeon crawler or even a tactical game. It's a racing game with asymmetrical play as every scenario is about completing objectives faster. That said, the combat system and items are really fun and the hero classes add a lot of replayability.

Update 2016: If you download the android app for this game and run THOSE campaigns, this easily gets a +1 to its score!

nice twist on things. and is definitely a big hitter these days. however this game is much more of a skirmish game based in a dungeon than a crawler. some of the features are great. but i feel there are way too many components. most certainly an improvement on the first edition, streamlining the rules where possible.  oh and the minis are pretty awful too. we enjoy a game of this from time to time. but it is nowhere near a favourite at the gaming table

To me, this just felt like someone took a generic MMORPG and put it on a board. Coming from World of Warcraft (on PC), it's just not a comparison - and I didn't even care for that. It plays too slow, so you don't get a sense of panic or anything, and the decisions aren't very interesting, so there's not much for you to think about while playing, either.

For me, I'd rather play something like Space Hulk: Death Angel, The Lord of the Rings Card Game, Apocalypse Chaos, or TIME Stories. All of these (except TIME Stories) do a better job of evoking a sense of panic, as you play, and provide a real battle mechanism for the fights. Or, in the case of TIME Stories, it has a better system for telling a story, while the game is still just a "roll to see if you succeed" style game.

When playing an MMO, you have to work out a game plan in advance, coordinate in real time, prepare the right supplies, get your timing right, and so on. There's some amount of randomness in a big fight, but it can be completely mitigated by the proper tactics and preparation. Getting that all into place takes skill and effort to accomplish.

Or if you're playing a traditional tabletop RPG, really the hope is that the players will come up with clever ways to defeat the enemy beyond just "I use my sword", "Okay, roll 2 d10...good, you hit him for 2 DP." It's supposed to be centered on storytelling and improvisation. The dice serve purely as a mechanism for the DM to simulate any random idea under the sun that you might have.

All of that is lacking in Descent. It's not interesting from a storytelling nor mechanical sense. There's no game to the game. But all of that said, I suspect that this is largely true of most dungeon crawl board games and, probably, most people aren't looking for more than that. Descent seems to be the most popular title in this area, thanks to how streamlined the gameplay is. So, if you enjoy a game where you're rolling a dice and seeing what happens, then this is supposedly the best of the bunch.

Personally, I'll play those other games.

Certainly more competitive than expected. The overlord role is demoralizing to play when crushed by the heroes.

The shop and traveling stages between the quests are great but somewhat lacking in length. It would be nice to have a little more moments for the hero characters to be involved in other incidents outside of the incredibly competitive quests.

The game plays incredibly well and is overall quite balanced.

A fun game of dice rolling, dungeon bashing, and monster slaying.
Descent has a well thought out combat system with a good mechanic involving spending possible 'surges' for additional combat abilities.
Another good addition involves heroes trading a limited pool of fatigue tokens for additional movement or abilities.
The overlord has control of all the monsters and a handfull of cards that do nothing to help the heroes whatsoever.

The game is fun when playing as either the heroes or the overlord, the only drawback is the price tag.

This 2nd edition is very different from the 1st. 2nd edition is designed to be played as a campaign of small scenarios where heroes and the overlord upgrade themselves between missions. I like the new combat system that uses defence dice. The game box is smaller and the same is true for the scenarios and playing time. Rules are simpler too.

I really didn't like the new LOS system. Seems so stupid, so I am using the LOS rules from Imperial Assault.

I liked HeroQuest as a kid and this seemed like a more grown up version of that little nostalgia bomb.  Basically, it did exactly that.  I haven't been able to get it on the table with my regular group (for a full 4 player + 1 overlord game).  My only plays are with my wife (me as overlord, and she will play 2-3 heroes).  I had the rules screwed up for the first couple of tries and my wife (I had monsters taking 2 attack actions when they didn't move... whoops!).  She got understandably frustrated since basically, she couldn't win.  We tried again with the correct rules and it went a lot better. 

I think that the one sided beating she was getting when I wasn't playing the mosters correctly kind of soured her on the game, so it might be a while before it sees the table again.  

Overall, I like the game.  I'm not sure it will see more than one campaign with my group.

A game that improves enormously the more players you have, and consequently underutilized by me. The obligatory dungeon crawler.

You'd be hard pressed to find a better "dungeon crawler". If you're wanting to roleplay, the spawning monsters and relatively small number of opponents hurts the experience - but the mechanics and components are tough to beat.

All hail the new king of dungeon crawlers!  My opinion of this game has steadily increased since I first played it, and I'm sure it will reach 10 with a few more expansions and twists.  Proof that the All-vs-One/Overloard/Game Master style of dungeon games is not a thing of the past!  Also the fact that this game is so elegant and simple means it was very easy to teach to people unfamiliar with this style of adventure game.  Descent 2.0 is actually easier to teach, easier to run as game master, and more fulfilling than SDE!

A good dungeon crawl, but needs a solo/coop option in this day and age.  Some of the scenarios can be over too quickly and others seem impossible to win.  Still, it is a fun game with great dungeony components.  

*edit:  This is an 8 (very good) with co-op expansion.

Played 2 first sceneries, my first impression, this is more of the race game then classical dungeon crawler. 

Some changes I really like: heroes development, usage of different monsters during scenarios.

Some I really dislike: the race nature of quests, lack of equipment.

I'll update this comment after ending whole campaign, (hope the score will change) for now I prefer 1ed.

I wouldn't actually class this as a dungeon crawl but it is a great tactical game between an overlord and the heroes that really shines in a campaign where these tight tactical games go on to tell a pretty cool story. 

The Road to Legend App though turns this into a fully co op classic dungeon crawl and makes it one of the best in the genre to boot!

Honestly blown away with how much the app has made me want to play this game again. 

An 8 without. A 9 with the Road to Legend App.

An excellent way to spend an afternoon this co-op/asymmetrical dungeon crawlers makes for a great addition to your shelf if you're looking for a solid long term play session.  The base game is enough to keep you coming for a good while and the numerous expansions can keep the game fresh and exciting.  However the game itself can be a bit pricey and will take up a large amount of space once a few blisters and expansions are added in, not really for the casual gamer/collector.

Great game. I did enjoy playing it as a player and I also played as the Dungeon Lord a couple of games aswell.  Very Hero Quest style dungoen crawl game, fast paced once everyone knows what they are doing. Co-op based, Character development style, X.P. earning game that can continue through campaigns in the book or customised.

Withholding a rating on this one for the time being. I've played the intro scenario as well as the first campaign scenario. Doesn't really feel like 1e Descent which is what I was hoping for, but with a faster playtime. Maybe that was unrealistic. Going to run a campaign and will revisit my comments and perhaps venture a rating at that point.

Update 3/26/13: Feels too much like Mansions of Madness to me, which I didn't really care for.

Update 12/18/13: After a campaign game my take on this one is changing. I think that it really comes into its own as a campaign system.

Wow, Game is 100% pure win. Rated a 9 compared to Descent1 due to depth and complexity of D1 vs D2. Over time i am sure this will be a 10 as more items and content are released.

Excellent components. Playing first test game today. 
After two plays, intro scenario,  Overlord 1 heroes 1.

Search is harder, witnessed the knockout syndrome issue but was manageable due to healer in party.

Feels like Descent but Different and this is good as it will have a place on my shelf and i think this will be a favorite of my wife's.

This is a really good game for what it does; however, what it does isn't appealing to me.

Nice update to the original. Faster, more playable, less rule confusion, better balancing, better artwork. A bit less epic tho due to the smaller dungeons and thus less fun without campaign play.

The more I played it, the less I liked the gameplay, too many bothersome optimization/cheesing when performing turns and minor rules that boggle the gameplay.

The game itself is pretty decent and the minis are well made.  Like most games made by Fantasy Flight, the components are high quality.

I have only played a few times and might like it more with more plays.

Have played this a few times, and unfortunately had the rules wrong three of the four times (as a result am having a bit of trouble getting it to the table with 2-players) but I really like the game.

Normally play as the overlord, but seem to be rolling too well to be an overlord. Fell like I have to hold back, despite having been told that I could go all out in the game. 
Considering giving the heroes some more powerful starting equipment when playing 2-players.

Hope to play it with more players soon.

What the hell is this shit?  Take Descent, strip every bit of chrome off of it, inject some of the worst scenario writing I have ever seen (Hurry!

Zero exploration, very little treasure, and unkillable heroes.  This is not a dungeon crawl!

After trading away the first edition I was pretty sure I didn't need this one in my life.  However I kept hearing so many good things about the new edition.  It sounded like this new version fixed a lot of the problems that I had with the old.

Turns out that it did.  Descent 2.0 plays faster and is more streamlined experience, with campaign rules built in.  Plus Fantasy Flight abandoned their enormous "coffin-boxes" (which were a pain to store) in favor of the more shelf-friendly square (also referred to as "ticket-to-ride style box").

I've played a couple times now and I like it...but I don't think I need to own it (especially now that one of the guys in my group has a copy).  It's fun enough but it just doesn't light my world on fire.  

I think what sets it apart from other, more interesting tactical skirmish games, is the terrain.  The maps are so small that there isn't many opportunities for maneuver.

Plus there are few spaces on the map that work differently than any other space.

This is not to say that there are no opportunities for clever moves (because there are), it all just feels a little like the game runs on rails.

It's a great production and a step up from the original edition.  I'm happy to play it - especially since the social experience DOES come close to replicating that RPG feel.  It won't make my list of all-time greats though.

Everything I wanted 1st edition Descent to be. Distills the best of the first edition while cutting down on the chaff to produce an adventure campaign that's light enough to pick up and play and with enough variation and depth to hold interest. Lots of varied quest objectives and campaign out of the box. I can't see using 1st edition much again and am looking forward to bringing back some classic monsters and heroes with the upcoming conversion kit.

Mindkét kiadással 1-1 partit játszottam, így nem tudom megítélni, melyik a jobb, ezért ugyanolyan pontszámot adtam erre is, mint az elsőre. De leszögezem, hogy az elsőnek sokkal jobban bejött a hangulata, az valahogy titokzatosabb volt, de lehet hogy csak jobb pillanatomban játszottam azzal:)
Néhány dolog sallangmentesebb lett a 2.-ban, egy kicsit le lett zoomolva az egész (tábla, szörnyek, doboz), de azért legalább felerészt  ugyanaz  a játék. Sérelmezem, hogy mindenhol a rövidségét emelték ki... Nekünk semmivel se volt rövidebb, mint a régi! Kipakolás ugyanolyan szöszmötölős, szabály se 2 perc, és maga a játék is 2-3 órás, nem tudom, hol a sokat emlegetett másfél órás játékidő??? Újabb partit szeretnék vele játszani, aztán meglátjuk, megéri-e lecserélni a régit.

While the mechanics have been done before, never have they been better.  The asymmetric play of heroes and overlord creates an excellent experience.  But what sets this game apart is the campaign.  Playing quests in a long campaign gives the players a real sense of personalization.  It also allows for different experiences when roles are changed.  Campaign is the reason to keep coming back.  I've played similar Ameritrash games, but this is the best.

Opinion in comparison to the 1st edition+road to legend:
Not sure if it's way better. There are many elements that are improved, like the defense and the reinforcements-spawning system, los, monster movement etc, but I hate the fact that you don't get real treasure or level-ups while in the dungeon and you have to buy it in between adventures. This makes the game almost purely tactical in nature. I'd surely break that rule if I designed dungeons.

Opinion without comparing to the 1st edition:
great dungeoncrawling game! wished for more yummy treasures.

Descent is the go-to dungeon crawler for the present era. Though it's basically a tactical skirmish game, the adventure scenarios and campaign option provide a richer context. A Game Master (Overlord) is needed, but this role is more than a facilitator -- they are vying for a win directly against the hero players. Streamlined rules allow you to jump into the game quickly, and the miniatures are nicely detailed (though painters will lament flash and some random imperfections). The insert in this box is amongst the worst I've seen; once the map tiles were punched, it was nearly impossible to return everything to the box. I've had success playing the game solo, though you lose the surprise elements from the Overlord. Polished, intutive, replayable and benefitting from strong publisher support, you can't go wrong with Descent as the dungeon-delving representative in your collection.

RATING: 7
First Impression: This is a simple dungeon crawler with little to no bookkeeping. The components are top-notch FFG and the scenarios are really thematic. The minis are begging to be painted. Each character seems to play differently, with variable powers and abilities. 

10 Plays: The campaign structure and character progression in the game are compelling. Scenario balance seems to suffer somewhat with fewer characters and I believe the sweet spot would be a party of 4. The rushed feeling of the built-in timer mechanisms is beginning to feel tiring.

I was surprised that this game is more a combat game than a roleplaying game. Nevertheless it's a fast-paced easy to learn adventuregame. With not that much rules there are a lot of possibilities to do in your turn. Odds can change very quickly and that's a good thing about the game.

RATING: 3
Most important flaw of this game: This is not a dungeoncrawl! The atmosphere is almost gone. Combat is not that exciting especially that a lot of quests do not concentrate on combat (which is good in general). But FFG tried to make it faster, less clunky than Descent 1.0 (which I did not liked as well) and Descent 2.0 is on the other side for me: Too light, too predictable without any excitement.

In my opinion Descent 2.0 is another overhyped product of FFG (like Mansions of Madness is). In theory the mechanics like the class system and the integrated campaign system sound great, but on the board this game has not that much to offer. Hopefully FFG will create another DOOM board game when DOOM 4 is released. DOOM was so much better than Descent 1.0 and it is even better than Descent 2.0. Another fail for me...

I haven't played the 1st Edition of Descent, so I can not comment on the differences. I enjoy 2nd edition very much, although it does have its flaws. I do find the game very intense, the "rush" aspect of it often emphasizes the importance of every decision you make in the game, and there is lots of back and forth discussion among players about tactics and what to do.  The monster and heroes are interesting and the various effects and special attacks they can make add great flavour to the game.

I find the game somewhat annoyingly imbalanced at times - but this opinion could change, as I get to know the game a bit better and thus understand tactics and proper decision making. Our group is 4 players - 1 overlord and 3 heroes.  We lost three quests in a row at the end of Act 1 and the Interlude, seemingly because of just overwhelming odds, which caused one of our hero group to refuse to play ever again.  We continued into Act 2 and I kept playing his character, and we bought a powerful item, one a quest, and then picked up two Relics, winning the next two quests. The last two Act 2 quests we played were VERY close calls - which made for very exciting gameplay.

Because it's an FFG game, all the components are top notch. However, it really annoys me that they did not include miniatures for the lieutenants. This is part of their business model - they go on to sell pewter miniatures from their website for $10 each.  I know making molds for figures is very expensive... but I really wish they had included them.

Jury is still out for me. I prefer to be the "1" in "1 vs all" games, and I'm not sure how well the game is balanced. The hero's seem to have exponentially more options and choices. I'll play it a half dozen times before making a call.

Yes I like Descent2 with the App. Yes it actually is a great dungeon crawler. It is not as good as Mansions of Madness 2, which simply puts you INTO a HP Lovecraft book, BUT Descent 2 is a very good story telling game too and you'll love the Campaigns.

Buy some and enjoy the stuff. 

As a solo gamer or social player this is simply a must buy with the App.

EDIT: it is even more ...

If you ever played dungeons or Raids in World of Warcraft btw, this Descent2 with the App comes very close to it for a boardgame: boss tactics, enemy healers getting controlled, DPS and Tank control. It is pretty much all there but now you can rely on your tactics and strategy without having the eye hand video coordination of a 16 year old ...

Great great game and with the added Delve adventures, endless replayable.

The first game I made a full foamcore set for, and a great little dungeon crawler.  I never played the first edition, however from everything I've read (and played for that matter) it seems 2nd ed is a lot more accessible and fun.. which so far has been the case.

Looking to get a few expansions for this to increase the content.

I bought at BN 75% off sale. I grew up playing Dungeons & Dragons, so fantasy themes are always near and dear to me. I figure this is as close as I will get to playing an RPG with my wife and two daughters. It is a great, simpler alternative to playing an RPG. FF continues to support the game with expansions. The base game gives you all you need to play for many game sessions. Then, add expansions as you see fit with many avenues to explore depending on your tastes. It fills a fantasy niche in my board game collection that I was missing. The only drawback is the game takes some time to setup for a session. Plus, it's a campaign style game, so you really need to have the same group of people for each session.

The second edition does some things better than the first one, but it's not a superior game. I would say it's more practical one, with less components, it's smaller to set up and faster to play. But I still miss some 1st edition features that are absent here.

Look, there's a lot to like about Descent 2.0: the miniatures are awesome, the character abilities and items are great, and the episodic play makes an epic game fit into nice bite-size chunks. But despite appearances this is not a "dungeon crawl" game, this is a tactical skirmish type thing, and in my experience, it's a pretty unbalanced one. True, some of our games came down to the wire, but just as many turned out to be disappointing blowouts. As the overlord, it's not fun seeing the heroes cripple your chances of winning before you've even taken a turn; likewise as the heroes, having a few dice rolls make an encounter obviously unwinnable really sucks the fun out. Both of these things happened across multiple playthroughs. The fact that so much of the game revolves around blocking movement rather than fighting and exploring seems to run counter to the theme, and despite the designers' best attempts, it's still just not much fun being the overlord. I really wanted to like it, but Descent just doesn't really do it for me.

RATING: 7
Pros: really quick to set up and play.  Some complain about the set-up time to play ratio, but the set-up seemed very quick to me relative to the play time.  The first scenario was done in about 45 minutes.

Played the first scenario, Fat Goblin (two sets of encounters) and The Cardinal of something (two sets of encounters.)

We won 4 out of 5 encounters (granted, the starter is a given) - we only rescued 1 bundle of crops in the first Fat Goblin encounter set (counting that as a loss), and the Overlord rescued 3, making the second portion of the Encounter that much more difficult.  We still won the 2nd portion, but just by a single turn... Squib? would have been off the board on the OL's next turn.

We played a total of 6-7 hours of Descent.  In that amount of time, I'd rather play one or two 3-4 hour games of (properly modded) Doom.  During some of that time playing Descent, I simply stopped caring.  However, I was engaged at other times.

I did not like how in first Fat Goblin encounter set and in the 2nd Cardinal encounter set, you start with big fat creatures blocking your way!  Even in the very first encounter, we were quickly blocked by giant 4x4 monsters preventing our passage.  Makes me wish I had that Scout character which could walk through enemies!  They're just walls of meat you have to mow down!  Fortunately, in the 2nd case, Hugo the Glorious's special made quick work of one of the blocking golems.

Also, given the map sizes, I felt like there weren't very decisions you could make relative to Doom was reduced, compared to a sprawling map of Doom.

Respawning monsters also left me feeling a bit cold.

The encounters also feel rather disconnected, and doing well in the previous encounter can have a big effect on the following encounter.  In the Cardinal encounters, during the first one, the Heroes did very well and the OL only resurrected one zombie.  If he had resurrected 3 of 4 (rather than 1), the Heroes would have been much more greatly pressed for time during the 2nd Encounter and would've lost.  The fact that doing poorly in one encounter means you do poorly in the next seems a bit odd, given that they could easily be played in different sessions and didn't feel THAT connected.

In sum, Descent is a great bite-size adventure, especially if the heroes like to win.  Have an hour and a half?  You can totally play Descent 2nd Edition.

However, I'd rather play Doom - it's more interesting and tense throughout, whereas Descent felt like your decisions didn't really matter in some cases because there was only one or two real choices.

MUCH improved balance over first edition, but not a huge fan of the smaller dungeons.  I really like the freedom to choose monsters (within limits) for the overlord.

More streamlined rules than the original.  Better balance in the campaign (with much less runaway leader problem) than Road to Legend.  One-shots and the campaign have much shorter playtime than their first edition counterparts.

The downsides compared to first edition that I can see:
The characters don't progress in the middle of quests.  If you're normally interested in one-shots and you like the idea of your heroes gaining power through the quest, this will be a *big* problem for you.
Seems less replayable than the original, and definitely less amusement/$ spent than the original.

I still like it better, but you do have to keep these in mind.

- The production quality of this game is just amazing.
- The variety in the heroes is just awesome, and with the conversion kit there is a ton to play here for a long time.
- Quest seem to last the perfect amount of time, does not over do its welcome.

Dislikes:
- The balancing swings between scenarios kind of cause the game to become boring
- The light of site rules are just dumb
- The respawn rules for monsters are usually also dumb.

Notes:
- I originally thought this was going to become THE dungeon crawl game, but there are just too many things weird about this game for me to give it that designation.

Have only played a few times, but seems like what I always wanted the D&D box games (Ashardalon, Ravenloft) to be.

RATING: 7
I'm really happy with this purchase and it's a welcome addition to the collection.  The kids finished the intro mission and then "Played" out the action for he next hour or two!  

If it has failings, it's that you kinda need to play the campaign.  It doesn't seem to have enough jazz as a "stand alone" game. You kind of need to buy the expansions too...  some extra monsters would be very welcome.

What keeps Descent down at this level is the Overlord.  Playing as the overlord is similar to being the DM.  You can't just play the game, you need to "balance" at the same time.  That really takes the fun out of it.  If you want to play that way, just play D&D.  

The Road to Legend App is a vast improvement!  Play with that!!!

When I was 12 my mum bought me a copy of Hero Quest, and we spent one night playing through it as a family. It sticks out as one of the most fun evenings that I can remember at that age, but its the only time I can actually remember playing the game in full.

I have a vague recollection of getting it out again to try and teach my friend, who became instantly disenchanted with it because I was insistent that when I played a certain card that I'd dealt for myself, it meant that his character instantly died.

Anyway, here I am in my 30s and looking for that 'dungeon adventure' type experience once more. A quick peek at eBay tells me that my near mint copy of Hero Quest - played properly only once, and played like a spanner perhaps once or twice more - was worth the better side of £100.... Excellent, I'm so glad I've still got it.

A brief phone call to my mother leaves me lost for words, as she ever so calmly advises me that most of my old toys went to charity. I don't talk to my mother any more.

So, where now? I'm not forking out silly money for a board game, but there's a certain itch that is becoming more and more prevalent and uncomfortable.

I REALLY REALLY WANT TO KILL A DRAGON!!!

Fast forward some extensive internet searching and I get the distinct impression that Descent SE is the way forward. 

Too bloody right it is - Dragons aplenty, magic coming out of your ears, and more goblins than you can shake a stick at.

If I were to give it one criticism, maybe its a bit too imbalanced in favour of the heroes. That said, the Overlord is a great role to play for the evening..... Lots of MWAHAHAHAs and such.

RATING: 8.5
Having played the 1st edition only about 6 times, I'll leave the comparisons to the experts.
This game is a solid try to have an RPG boardgame without too much a fuss. It is enjoyable, competitive and FUN.
The heroes have to be careful to gather the searches whenever given the chance though, to be up to par with the Overlord.
What I didn't like is the Line of Sight rules, since everyone usually has LoS to their targets, thus eliminating a tactical perspective of the game. Also, Large Monster Movement. Whereas a singe large monster can block to the path to all heroes, one hero cannot block the path to monsters. Tactically, that doesn't allow the Knight/Berserkers to act as "tanks" and maybe protect weaker characters in various situations. 
I'd like to see FFG being more active in answering the numerous questions of gamers.
All in all, a very entertaining game with an interesting campaign system.

RATING: 6.5
It's a nice streamlined campaign dungeon crawler. The game flows usually quickly, but since positioning and generally tactics are very important it may suffer from some necessary slow downs.

The campaign works well in general, but still there are major balancing issues between missions, overlord/heroes and importance of heroes for the party. Since descent's design is rather open and gravitates towards flashy, unique abilities, this has to be expected to a certain degree. 

On one side it does offer room for heroic deeds and devastating acts of malice, on the other it may result in some very one-sided, unexciting missions!

While I appreciate the design in general I still think it has some problems, which must be mediated by the group itself, which has to take care that balance doesn't completely fall apart.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The definitive dungeon crawling baord game, made even better by new, efficient rules and faster play. The new edition improves almost every aspect of the 1st edition (with a few minor exceptions), adds a campaign system, and does a great job eliminating all the "junk" that turned the 1st edition into a multi-hour grind. A brave move by FFG to make such drastic changes, and an extremely wise one.

The first dungeon crawler I've enjoyed. Played Acts I & II of a standalone quest where two dragons had to destroy a bridge and in the second act we had to kill a zombie villager and take his corpse out of the exit. The second act was much easier than the first. Played as the thief. He seemed a bit overpowered with his heroic feat and gaining defense from an adjacent player. Was a 5 player game. We won both acts.

Not a fan of D&D or 4v1 games.  Great production value and great gameplay.  Just not my cup of tea as I don't have all day to play a campaign.  The solo rules are fiddly, but now there is an app that helps with that.  Wish I would have been able to give that a try.

RATING: 10
Great re-imagining in terms of mechanics and long-term appeal. The campaign editor on the FFG website adds a lot of versatility to created more themed scenarios. This is also my only objection with the base game as the 'loose' narrative structure makes the game less thematic.

RATING: 10
From HeroQuest as a kid until now, I've always loved a good dungeon crawl board game.  And I think this is as good as the genre has ever been.  One thing to be clear on before you get into this is that it doesn't have the feeling of exploration that Hero Quest or Descent 1st edition gives you.  This is a tactical fantasy miniatures game.  You know the goals as soon as the encounter is set up and it's basically a small tactical battle.  I know some people don't like 2nd Ed and the lack of exploration is the root of all their problems with the game.  The thing is, exploring rooms and killing stuff and collecting treasure gets old after a while if there isn't a strong story linking it all together.  Hero Quest (as much as I love it) and Descent 1st Ed. suffer from this sameyness.  In fact no board game has succeeded in giving a dungeon crawl feel along with a strong story- for that you need to play D&D.  Another thing 2nd has going over 1st edition is that this is so much more streamlined and easy to play than the bloated sessions of 1st Ed which basically ended up going nowhere anyway.  Anyway, enough comparisons.  This game has so many diverse scenarios and is rich with so much material, campaigns, and monsters, heroes, classes, etc.  You could play forever and never do the same thing.  And with a little imagination you can really get into the game and your character.  And there is a sense of discovery and story finding new equipment, encountering new monsters, and when each quest is set up, etc.  Combat is varied and fun with lots of special abilities but it doesn't bog down. Components are stellar.  Great game.

A fun game. It plays fairly quickly and FFG has done an amazing job on the components. The campaign rules are great and create a rewarding experience for a group that can manage to get together regularly. Some of the rules seem a little loose and there doesn't seem to be much balance between large and small monsters. Also, it is quite easy for the heroes to get caught in a beat-down cycle.

After one play, the first word that comes to mind is "streamlined."  It's a dungeon crawl where the heroes are competing against a single Overlord.  Each player has one character and a few items.  There is a chance to get more (temporary) items during the quest which may make things a little more to manage, but I don't think it'll be too bad.  

Players' turns are smooth.  Play start of round actions, then take 2 actions (move ,attack, rest, use cards, ...).  Components are very good.  I liked the detail on the miniatures and the graphics on the board (modular for different dungeons and made of thick interlocking cardboard).  Components to keep track of are health, stamina (used to do extra stuff), the miniature on the board, player mat, and a few face up cards.  Nothing overwhelming and easy to teach.

I'm always impressed with games that take a long time but don't feel like they take a long time.  18XX often epitomizes that for me.  I had the same feeling with Descent.  We were eating and explaining and it was a teaching game, but I was still surprised to find that we spent 2 hours at it.  Didn't feel long at all.

I'm not sure if it's something I'd want to play every week, but it might be.  Both last night on the ride home and this morning, I've been trying to think how the Overlord could possibly win the quest.  For me, that's always a sign of a good game.

Although the first quest was easy, I can see the opportunities for complexity and I'm looking forward to exploring it.

Initial Rating: solid 7 with possible upward mobility.

Es un juego temático de aventuras. Es la segunda edición, en la que se supone que han variado algunas mecánicas y en general han simplificado el juego, para que dure menos tiempo. Es bastante entretenido, y permite jugar campañas, encadenando escenarios. El escenario siguiente depende de cómo te fuera en el actual. Es un juego muy "cinematográfico". Cada partida es como una parte de una película (la peli sería la campaña entera).

Hay mucha variedad de personajes, cada uno con sus características propias. Es cooperativo, de 2 a 5 jugadores, y con duración variable, en función del escenario. En un escenario normal (sólo he jugado el de introducción) hay dos partes. La segunda parte también se configura según acabase la primrea. A priori parece tremendamente rejugable.

Recomendado para aquellos que disfruten con juegos que cuentan una historia.

Descent is what you make of it kind of. If you want to get into a dungeon crawler and really immerse yourself, it's a great game. A lot of setup but worth it. The app works fantastic with it. I've played solo with the app also and it's a lot of fun. Hard actually. haha. You have to be dedicated to the campaign though. That's where the game shines. Taking your characters through the various scenarios and leveling up and learning how they work better together.

Just a couple of plays so far, but it seems pretty fun. The rules are a bit wuzzy, ironically, but the customization aspect is fun and rolling dice to punch monsters is always good. 

The question remains for me as to how balanced the game is for different hero characters and classes. Additionally, I am not sure I like the spawning rules for the Overlord - sometimes it seems like it is a bad thing for the heroes to eliminate monsters, because they simply appear and act again in the next turn regardless. Hm...

Also, re: the final scenario in which the Heroes win the first encounter in the first turn unless the Overlord has dash in his/her hand. What the heck.

A great dungeon crawler that doesn't get too serious or too involved.  Quests can be played in a reasonable amount of time, or you can try campaign play, stretchd out over several sessions.

The lower rating at the moment is due to only having one playthrough completed. We just got the app so my wife and I can play co-op as that was a draw to actually getting the game.

RATING: 6
I am a HUGE fan of Descent 1 (i gave it a 10), and our gaming group aswell.
Descent 2 is a perfect example of a game that was streamlined to death.
With the change in mechanics most of the overlord objectives in the different quests comes down to delaying the heroes for as long as possible to win the game.
prolonging the game for as long as possible is such a horrible game mechanic and makes no fun at all!

We have rather strong players in our group including the overlord(s). The game is still "balanced", in a sence  that the heroes win about 50% of the game. I say this because even though the overlord succeeds in delaying the heroes, the game often (not always) is balanced by a blunt and boring game mechanic that often comes down to an almost random win of ether side at the end of the quest. 

The positive aspects of the game is the rather short playtime of about 3 hours per quest on one hand and the flawless integration of the campaign on the other.
in every other aspect i would recommend to buy the first edition. It may tay take up to 8 hours per quest and there is only a horrible campaign mechanic which came through an expansion, but it is also epic, the heroes many divers action possibilitys influence the outcome ultimatly and at the end of the day it is just way more fun!

I still have hope for the game anyways. Descent 1 became the game it is now because of its marvelous expansions which enriched the gameplay with many game mechanics. Descent 2 has yet to get an expansion which fullfills the same needs. Until then i stay disappointed and the game will hit the table every month or so in the hope, that the next quest will better than the last..

I really like it. There's nothing to grumble about besides of that ridiculous "Line of Sight" rule and the fact that I really wish for an official "true Co-Op no dungeonmaster"-variant.

Playtest the game with 4 other players.  Two plays, finished 4 encounters, 1 basic (2 encounters) and 1 expert (2 encounters) games.

I played with Ranger in the first basic game and Magic User in the secound game.

Expert game is much interesting than the basic game because there are more options.

The basic game seems a bit dry and too simple.

I don't like the large size monster movement rule but I know it is designed for speed up the game (shorter the playing time).  The line-of-sight rule is another unusual rule I don't like so much.  Again it is designed on purpose to shorten the playing time.

Descent is a solid game with fast play rule and many options to keep your interest in the game.  The story behind each encounter is like a rpg adventure which I like the most.

The second addition is a slight improvement over the 1st edition. The streamlined rules help. But the general consensus is that the player characters are often behind the eight ball in a number of the scenarios. Maybe with experience their performance would improve, but generally speaking it has not been difficult to win as the Overlord. It just had us feeling like the whole thing was imbalanced. 

edit - the players seem to be figuring it out. I lost my first scenario after making a couple of early tactical errors. We'll see if it's the start of a trend.

I finally got around to playing this with my Tuesday night group. In roughly two hours we were able to play through the first two quest. Specifically the intro quest and the first two part quest. Overall everyone enjoyed it. It hinted back to the original game but gave a much more streamlined playing experiance.

I only have two complaints about the game and neither of them are a deal breaker. First is that your limited to what characters are avalible to your group through limited class card sets. Having two sets of everything included in the game would have been optimal IMO. Second is that alot of the stuff in the game doesn't have a specific mini, this applies to both heros and monsters.

Descent in bite-sized chunks.  It is streamlined and quicker, but it feels dumbed-down.  Most disappointingly,  all sense of adventure is gone - it's more like a skirmish game now than an RPG-lite.  I like first edition better, but this one will get more play because it is quicker.

RATING: 6
Zuviel Vereinfacht.
Echtes Descent Feeling möchte nicht aufkommen.

- keine Stadt (abgespeckt in Kampagne)
- Schätze sind sehr abgespeckt
- Mini Dungeons
- gnadenlos bescheuerte Verteidigungswürfelei



+/- Kampagne könnte ganz Nett sein

+ Balance scheint halbwegs zu stimmen
+ Erfahrungssystem

2. Spiel Kampagnenneustart:
Maskenball mit 2 Helden = lächerlich.
Maximal 2 Gäste kann man retten. Würfelwurf erbrachte eine 3 und somit eine Niederlage für die Helden. Das 1. Szenario hätte man sich somit schenken können.

7->6.5
- Spawnmechanik: Mist- warum sollte der OL jemals kleine Monster in einer freien Gruppe einsetzen. Vor seinem Spielzug erhält er meistens Verstärkung was die Helden dazu zwingt Monster zu Betäuben, Lähmen oder sonstiges.
- Bewegungssystem von großen Monstern: Der größte Witz- Ein Drachen mit Bewegung 4 kann ohne  weiteres in einem Zug 7+ Felder bewegt werden...schneller als jedes kleine Monster.
-Wie in Descent 1 unausgewogene Szenarien. Manche Szene 2 Szenarien sind für Helden oder Ol praktisch nicht mehr zu gewinnen wenn Szene 1 nicht geschafft wurde.
Wie "balanciert die Szenarien sieht erkennt man Eindrucksvoll an den ganzen Änderungen des FAQ



Nach einer fast abgeschlossenen Kampagne.
Bullshit. Man fragt sich warum es mehrere Szenen gibt. Letztlich läuft jedes Spiel auf ein Wettrennen hin in dem die Helden mit 3-4 Schätzen rauskommen und der OL in der 2. Szene fast alle Karten auf der Hand hat.
Descent 2 ist kein totaler Fehlschlag, für ne kurze Partie zwischendrin ist es ok. Wann immer aber Zeit ist würde ich Descent 1 jederzeit vorziehen.

Nach der Kampagne: 
Overlord machte den Fehler dass er zwischen den einzelnen Szenen immer 4 Karten zusätzlich zog, dadurch wurde es für die Heldengruppe extrem schwer da der OL oftmals die Karten die er in der vorrunde Spielte sofort wieder auf die Hand bekam. Alles in allem fühlt sich das ganze Spiel nicht gut an.  Deutlich schlechter als Descent 1

6.5 -> 6
Je öfters gespielt wird desto bescheuerter wird es. Die Vorteile gegenüber dem 1. Teil hat es aufgrund der 50. Erweiterung und verloren. Das Spiel wird am ende genauso aufgebläht sein wie der 1. Teil...nur dass der 1. Teil Spaß macht.

An entertaining game, although some of the missions are too biased towards the Heroes or Overlord.

From having run an entire campaign as the Overlord, I feel that you really need a better selection of monsters (Conversion Kit needed?), and that the selection restrictions need to be lifted (only TWO missions in the entire campaign allow the Elemental).

[EDIT: Rating increased]The co-op campaigns in the companion App have really reinvigorated this title. Enjoy playing through it with my friends cooperatively.

RATING: 8.5
I wanted an RPG that harkens back to the joys I used to experience during games of Hero Quest; instead, I ended up with Shining Force on a board.  Is this a bad thing?  Definitely not, though it did through me for a loop for the beginning.  

Let me reiterate:  TACTICAL game with rpg elements.  TACTICAL, not a dungeon delving RPG.

Possibly one of the best part about this game is that the Overlord has a clear objective:  To WIN.  There's none of this "tell a good story, and make sure the heroes have fun on their path to victory" crap.  Plain, simple, WIN.

Descent is also deceptively simple.  An initial read-through of the instructions feels straight-forward enough, but it's not until after you've played a few Quests that you realize you didn't know half of what you thought you knew.  True to Fantasy Flight's standards, words mean everything.  Terms such as "target space" do not mean the same as "target empty space" (For clarification, a character may only target a space if it is occupied by an enemy figure).  As such, Descent presents a steep learning curve, but once achieved, it is well worth the time and energy spent to play it.

Out of the box, this is overall a cleaner and much more playable version of v1. Much of the fat and fiddliness has been stripped away. Despite the cleanup, though, it did take a couple steps backward.

In particular - scenario play in this game is lackluster. It's still fun, turn to turn, but it doesn't have the sweeping epic progression. And I really, really miss that.

Usually I find it more fulfilling to sit down and play 1 scenario in Descent v1 in 2.5-3 hrs than I do to play a few quests in v2 in the same amount of time.

Campaign play is what this version is all about. It's been seriously streamlined from Road to Legend. It's still not perfect, but if you want a dungeon crawler you can play a campaign of I haven't found a better one.

The variety of and upgrade path for the heroes, due to having fixed decks this time around, feels restrictive compared to v1. It works BETTER for campaign play this way, but I feel like it made this game a little less replayable.

The Overlord also gets less choices, but honestly, it does get things going a lot faster and not having to bother with currency refreshing.

The new hero respawn system is an improvement for both the heroes and the Overlord. Not having to run from a glyph back to your group is nice, and if the Overlord gets you in the right spot he can kill you over and over.

The mixup of dice is also simpler so the rolls end up feeling pretty... samey and less interesting. But again, streamlined.

Honestly I can forgive all these little things. Descent v1 might have been more interesting but it was a lot more fiddly. However there is one huge glaring issue I have with this game:

The new monster spawning system is fucked. It's nice that the Overlord doesn't have to rely on cards to spawn monsters, but it's utterly unforgivable that the Overlord can, for no cost, re-spawn a gigantic creature you just spent turns and turns taking down IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEXT TURN. What the fuck is this about? It's bullshit for the heroes and it's boring if you're the Overlord. No choice, no tension. Blah.

Despite that huge issue, I still have lots of fun whenever we play. Turn to turn, this is a fun system and is the best dungeon crawler I've found to date. Here's to hoping for an improved v3, I guess.

Was really hyped about this game but all my group were disappointed with it. I think the biggest problem is that one person is the overlord and it seems much easier for that person than for the other players. The players found it very frustrating. We played the first few scenarios in campaign mode, which seemed well thought out and flavourful.

It's a lovely looking and presented game I want to like, but it just doesn't click.

We found we preferred Temple of Elemental Evil, although it is much simpler

-edit-
With the Road to Legend app, this fixes the overlord problem, and I find the game much more enjoyable.

A decent game system but probably superseded by newer game systems that aren't so clunky. Flexible enough to cover a range of scenarios, and best of all, adaptable for home-brewed scenarios that are probably as good as any RPG out there... although hard core RPGers will probably disagree with me, but I no longer want (or am able) to play games that take a whole day to play any more. :)

Probably my favorite game. I mostly play 2 player with my wife, where she plays as the overlord and always wins. I love the mix of strategy and dice rolling. Also love the theme, as it is in my opinion the best substitute for D&D for people that don't have the time or regular gaming group for RPGs. Don't get to play as much as I would like though.

Yay, I finally got to play this dungeon crawler! I’m a hardcore eurogamer, but I’m also an “omnigamer”; I am willing to play every single game at least once. While eurogames are still by far my favorite genre, I also sort of enjoy light wargames and games which mix euroelements with ameritrash (such as, hm, Survive Escape from Atlantis, Eclipse, Claustrophobia, Kemet etc.) Descent is definitely a game in the ameritrash genre, and while I find it okay, it also showed me what I already knew; that eurogames are, in my personal book, the better games. 

I don’t really care about the theme or storytelling elements in games, and I hate random dice rolls, so Descent already was at a disadvantage before I even tried it out! After my 2-3 plays of it (two scenarios, the second being divided into two), I must say that it was an enjoyable experience which I will play again if asked. I think the reason is that, despite the things I don’t like, there is sort of a puzzle to solve with your friends, just like there is in a coop game – and I love coops. It was good fun to cooperate with three other players against the dungeon master. Also, there was actually a fair bit of strategy involved and some euro-y elements. You take two actions out of 7-8 or so each turn and need to choose those which best handles the specific situation. I like how the scenarios evolve and your character evolves too and gets extra abilities etc. The various characters feel different due to their special powers and the items they carry. 

Descent played very well with 4 heroes, and it played in a reasonable amount of time which is quite important to me – had the game taken 4 hours (like its predecessor) I am sure I would never play it again, but as our scenarios only took about 1-2 hours each, I’m definitely willing to play it again as long as I’m one of the heroes; I know I won’t enjoy the game as much if playing the dungeon master. All in all, Descent was a positive surprise and a game which, much to my surprise, I would play again a couple of times.

Basically, I'm not too eager to play this type of game.  Firstly, it does not support solitaire.  Secondly, it is too tedious to setup.  Thirdly, it is too many items and cards have to be referred during game play.  Is it too tedious and fiddly?  But... I don't know why.  This game like having a magnet to attract me to stick on it.

I like the straight rules and defence dice.It is far more tactical-decisions than first edition and plays faster but I think that is less epic-adventuring.The campaign system is nice and give life to the game.

Classic dungeon crawler board game. Sets the Overlord (similar to DM) against all of the other player characters with each one trying to accomplish a goal to win the mission.

RATING: 7
Descent.. I'm not really into RPGs but this one feels like a RPG that is very restricted and streamed line and there for i like it.
Because i like the RPG thinking of thing, battle hordes of enemies to save the land with magic and swords. 
So this game suits me very well.

The pros is that the game is included with alot of stuff, i mean alot! Nice minis, excellent quality on cards and map tiles. And it also includes a big book of scenarios. 
And with that it also works great as a sandbox game for your own scenarios or just random encounters. 

The cons are few, but one is that the story feels (in other better words) bad.. I'm not at all sucked into the story as i wanted to be. But on the other hand the story is what you do also.. but as for the writing and events it could have been better. 
Another is it takes along time, the game wants you to play about 9 scenarios and 1 scenario takes about 3-4 hours, on a gaming night it's hard to fit in more then that.. 
And the line of sight rules is stupid in this, it's better in Imperial Assault. 

To sum it up, truly excellent production with fun game play and alot of thing to choose as both the heroes and the overlord but with a kinda bad story.

BUT.. the art work is as great as usual and the figures are way better than the old ones, besides the goblins. The tasks for the overlord in the dungeons are the biggest advantage of the second edition. But overall it's a light version of it's predecessor.

If you liked HeroQuest, consider this the suped up version. If you like D&D, think of this as a simpler dungeon crawl experience that's good when your DM hasn't had time to prepare anything. Be sure to get this second edition, which has more story, options and oomph than the first edition.

One of the best games I've ever played, if not my #1 game.  Many play this as an Ameritrash game, but I play it as a Euro. It allows you to play it either way! The amount of pre-planning that goes into a quest is off the charts, and you get rewarded for it. Every turn and decision is extremely tense with the right group. The replayability is also insane due to the sheer number of ways to play: one-shot quests, many official campaigns, fan-made campaigns and one-shots, make your own quests/campaigns with FFG's editor, co-op mode with the Road to Legend app, and a crazy number of expansions. Even with the complexity and depth that this game offers, FFG managed to create an incredibly balanced experience at the 5 player count. The only complaint I have about this game is the dice rolls and the LOS rules are a bit wonky, otherwise it's perfect.

A pretty good dungeon crawler with lush details on the tiles, highly detailed models and a good combat system. Highly recommended for its campaign, but not so much when it comes to single sessions. Also, be prepared to create various house rules due to lack of good examples on how things work (some of the rules can be quite fuzzy).

RATING: 7
Initially, I thought this edition quite brilliant and much tighter than its predecessor. After playing several matches, however, I have come to recognize the lack of depth in some of the scenarios. Also, certain classes feel quite broken to me, or lacking in compelling level-up options.

So... Yeah. 2nd Edition is an upgrade in many ways, but it feels flawed in others. FFG solved the play length, but at what cost?

And the writing is awful.

The inability of heroes to permadeath, the constant respawning of the same monsters as well as the heavy spatial/blocking elements make this game a very average one for me. I also greatly dislike the heroes card art. The other components are great, so bumped my rating up one notch.

Would be great to play the game as Overlord with children, for this reason I might pick this up at some point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Base of the game seems solid but the rules does not make it a fun hack and slash dungeon crawler but a deep tactical game with unfair situations and exploits to gain advantage from.
The overlord has to know every single heroe ability and one wrong move can result in instant loss of the scenario, while sometimes rules make it possible to simply block pathways and prevent one side from achieving their goals. Heroic fights? No, more rule exploiting and never seen a game which demands it so much.
In a coop variant it is played best, for the sake of peace at the table.

As players the experience of both system may end up similar, but as an overlord, there is a lot more to chew here than in the seemingly "improved" design of Imperial Assault. Being able to fully customize your deck every quest, getting a ongoing theme with plot decks and getting rewarded for kills by getting more cards create an experience full of hard decisions for the overlord. Everything that was changed to it by Imperial Assault makes total sense to me, yet I'm not sure in the end it created a better alternative

RATING: 6
Over the course of a year, four friends and I played through the base campaign of Descent 2ED with me as Overlord. All of us were new to Descent. While I appreciate aspects of the game design, I just didn't have that much fun playing it. About the first 1/3 of the campaign I was a friendly Overlord that avoided using cheap feeling tactics. While the heroes seemed to have fun, it felt a little boring, and I also realized if I didn't slow them down there would be a snowball effect with them getting good gear and becoming unstoppable.

From then on I started playing as Mean Overlord, and while the heroes lost most of the missions after that and ultimately the campaign, they didn't seem to have that much fun and I was stressed out trying to maximize my strategy by keeping track of everything (which also became more and more difficult as they gained new equipment and abilities). 

One technique I often used was to horde Overlord cards and then unleash them all at once to pull off some crazy combo and win in a way that didn't make much sense thematically. While effective, that wasn't very fun compared to if I had been using my Overlord abilities more sporadically. Often, it felt like if I won a mission, there wasn't anything they could have done to stop me, and vice-versa if they won.

I also often used the same monsters to maximize my chances when a more even representation of the different monsters would have been more interesting.

The missions tended to last too long for my tastes, even when I set the game up ahead of time. Whereas 2-3 hours would have been nice, it often took us around 4 hours just to get through a two-part mission.

While I think there were a lot of good design decisions (such as simplifying line of sight), one design decision I don't agree with was for the winner of each mission to be more rewarded than the loser and also get to choose what the next mission would be.

Finally, the back story and intro/outro descriptions were really poorly written for people who weren't previously familiar with the universe Descent takes place in. Half the time we were confused why the missions were even taking place.

I am really enjoying playing this with my son and even by myself - post-op recovery attempts at Mice and Mystics and Mage Knight not going so well.
I'm not sure if I'll house rule line of sight or movement at all yet but the game does seem to be fairly well balanced as is even if some encounters are much easier for one side to win when focussing on the objective to the exclusion of all else.
The characters certainly have individual play styles but some start off far more useful than others - I thought Avric seemed ok til I realised a blue and yellow attack die combination with no ability to increase damage or mess with enemy defense using surges means his character may e hard to kill but he won't achieve anything much unfortunately.

6/2/2012 - Having played the quest almost half way through with two players (myself and Tom) with Tom playing 3 heroes, I have decided to rate this game as a 9.5. The gaming experience is excellent - it is so good that I can forgive the lack of clarity in some instances in the rules and the FAQ. 

So far in the quest as the overlord I lost the introduction quest, and I lost the first Act 1 quest we played (Death on the Wing). While Death on the Wing was not a total wipeout, victory for the heroes was reasonably comfortable. After this I changed strategy for the next quest (A Fat Goblin) and hoarded my cards from the first encounter, which paid off in the second encounter. The last quest played was the Masquerade Ball. I attempted to hoard my cards from the first encounter but in the end I think I started with 7 of my 15 cards in the second encounter after drawing. This was still enough to delay the heroes on the first move although I still didn't have everything I would have liked to throw at them early. A few good rolls however meant Lady Farrow was through a couple of doors fairly quickly. This encounter was the closest we have played so far. With Lady Farrow having 4 life left and at the last door (with 3 heroes bearing down on me). I had to escape through the door with the last attribute test. The roll worked, however it could have easily gone the other way. One more turn for the heroes and it was lights out. While I won this scenario, I am concerned that the benefit gained from winning was not that great, as the heroes picked up a large number of items while travelling and searching, meaning they had a bonanza at the shop. I fear this may have a significant benefit for them next quest, but we shall see.

Fun for kids and lovers of tactical RPGs, but lacking in true strategic depth.  Also scenario-based games are bound to lose their appeal unless one is willing to buy the expansions. This game is very good for what it is trying to be, I just don't know if I like this type of game very much anymore.  More and more I am becoming a staunch Euro fan, and this game is just about as far away from a Eurogame as it can be.

Excellently balanced and competitive game.  Be wary of reviews complaining about balance etc.  If you own all the expansions and have a group of players that are all about the competition, the game will shine.

Pleasantly surprised. Just the right level of complexity for a all-against-one dungeon crawl (which is to say, not much--although I haven't tried any expansions yet). But the main thing is that the scenarios are fun and have clear objectives beyond "destroy the monsters" or "get the treasure". We started through the campaign and some folks lost steam after 3 quests (total of 9), but I'd still like to do the full campaign at some point.

FFG's fantasy dungeon crawler. Nice power diversity with a good number of scenarios. Pretty straightforward dice rolling and movement and set up can kind of be a pain.

Cool art and minis though.

I really wanted to like Descent. In the end, the gameplay was too repetitive and uninteresting. It devolves down to just whacking baddies and getting whacked by baddies in really tight quarters. No thanks.

Notes: Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) DJ01, expansion DJ02 Conversion Kit and 4x DJ08 dice packs. Included in the base game.

I don't get the hype about this one. Lovely minis, but I don't like it as a multiplayer game - it is more of 2 player game in my opinion. I think Dungeon Saga delivers a far better dungeon crawl experience. This feels like you playing a console style race game.

Mi primer Dungeon Crawler de verdad. Robacuartos sin escrúpulos, pero la verdad es que está bastante bien acabado. Chirria por algunas partes, y es una pena muy gorda que si no es a 4 héroes flojea bastante, pero por lo demás... me ofrece la experiencia mazmorrera fantástica-medieval que le pedía. Preferiría que estuviera más pulido, en el Imperial Assault se nota que arreglaron muchos fallitos que tenia el Descent, pero el cambio de ambientación me echa para atrás. Esperando con muchas ganas el libro de campaña, y ojalá sigan sacando escenarios cooperativos.

Fan-freaking-tastic game.  Very different from first edition Descent, but still feels very familiar.  The overlord is much more interesting now, and the built-in campaign is well implemented.

I so wanted to like this...the pieces and minis looked cool, and who doesn't like a good dungeon crawl? But the background is dull and generic, and so were the adventures, which were just combat exercises with no real story or surprises. Even worse, I owned the game which meant I ended up being the Overlord, which I didn't want to be. 

The new app made this much more interesting, but games like Gloomhaven and others have eclipsed this in story and more interesting gameplay, so I sold all my stuff.

RATING: N/A
Really enjoying this game.  While it is made for 5 players max, I have been easily able to adapt it to a fun 7-9 player action.  

This game takes everything I loved about HeroQuest and builds on it.  This creates a fun linear campaign like HQ, but also allows for single quest or battle play through for those rainy day afternoons with some Noobs.  The expanded battle system and mechanics can be a bit tricky at the start, but iron themselves out easily as users get used to the features of the game.

The PROS:

Great for 2-9 players with some extended scaling and innovation.

Easy to learn and play

Characters stand alone and work well together at the same time.  Allows for multiple play styles to team up together.

The CONS:  

Only designed for 4 players max, and does take some creativity to scale for more players.

A bit heavy on rules for the non-gamer

Long sessions to accomplish single quests.

- The Overlord doesn't get as much gratifying progression as the heroes
- Combat is really fun (as is character progression), but isn't exactly rewarded as you need to "sprint" to the objective
- There's an incentive to hoard gold until act 2 which takes away the fun of progression
- There are a bagillion expansion packs

I really like this one.  The campaign is scads of fun.  It's more interesting to be the OL (over 1st edition), while still fun to be a PC.  The playtime is more manageable, and the game is no longer just a treasure chest dive.

Update: this does seem to skew pretty heavily towards the players, all things being equal.  I suppose I prefer that to the other way around, but buyers should be aware.

Though its predecessor was apparently a beast to play, Descent 2.0 has very intuitive rules once you get over all the small print in the rules booklet. It’s the ne plus ultra of dungeon crawlers: nice components, including great monster miniatures, a unique way of using dice, and a fun campaign system that has just enough complexity to make it interesting. One player plays the Dark Overlord, the rest individual warriors, mages, priests or rogues. I suggest watching a good “how to play” video first (e.g. like Rodney Smith’s), then looking up specific rules as needed. Other than the small print in the rules (a problem with a lot of Fantasy Flight games), my only real criticisms are (a) the uselessness of the cardboard insert, which prevents all the components fitting in the box (I cut it up and used the pieces to make two smaller boxes that fit everything in it nicely), and (b) the somewhat anti-thematic “no hero death” rule, which admittedly avoids player elimination. Instead of the fear of death motivating players, it’s time: each encounter makes the heroes act quickly before the Overlord achieves his objective.

Excellent game. Beats HeroQuest rather easily.
I really like that the Overlord (DM, Morcar or whatever) actually plays against the heroes. I played around 6 missions as the Overlord and, although I lost most of the rounds, I must say that this has been an enjoyable experience.
Once a player understood all the rules, the game can be taught in 5-10 minutes and by playing the introductory mission.

Gameplay is improved compared to 1st edition (simply encounters are shorter) - you can easily fit into 1..1,5h encounter - that allows you to play more in shorter timeframe. This is exactly what I was missing in 1st edition. Graphics are very good (cards, heroes cards, ect), tiles are finally not just brown something. Good idea of making the weapon and ability cards small - again - saves space on the table :) I see lots of improvements.

I bought this game because some friends wanted something similar to hero quest an old board game they used to play as children. it is an enjoyable group dungeon crawler with one player being the overlord. Although I usually do not like games where one person is singled out to be the bad guy this was okay. The theme and the ongoing quest was a real hit with everybody. This is a game that you will need to bring out several times to really get the experience. It is definitely not for everyone. It does have a miniature elements to it that some people do not like. We will be continuing quest in the future.

One player takes on the role of Overlord, and tries to defeat the other players, the heroes, in a fantasy dungeon skirmish quest.  Simple game, where players take turns activating their heroes (or monster groups), and move, fight, search, rest and quest their way through the scenario. Combat is clean, game play is brisk, and the scenarios are a perfect length.  The quest can be played one off, or as part of a linked campaign.  The components are excellent, and offers good, surprisingly tactical game play.  A vast improvement over the beast that was first edition Descent. Well done, if a bit soulless and one dimensional.

I believe that DOOM is the best iteration of this system.  DOOM gets you to the good stuff (tactical combat, special abilities, fun dice resolution system) with the least amount of hassle.  The hook of Descent 2 for me is the campaign system.  In concept, it is cool that the heroes and the overlord can level up.  However, the two sides are leveling up more or less equally, so the "leveling up" really just means that everyone rolls more dice and can take more damage.  It is not like the leveling up in say, Runebound, where you have to judge when you are powerful enough to take on greater challenges.  In D2, you do a series of missions at level 1, then a series at level 2, which is similar except everyone rolls twice as many dice.   This is underwhelming to me.  However, I do like how the outcome of each encounter affects how following ones unfold.  The campaign is suitably epic, but it is a commitment of quite a few game nights.  

Personally, I'd prefer to just get in and out with DOOM for the combat, play Mansions of Madness for the narrative, or Earth Reborn for a more intricate tactical experience.  D2 falls through these cracks for me, and is therefore getting Jones ruled off my shelves.  I would still very happily play D2 anytime, though.

The best tactical dungeon crawling skirmish race campaign all-vs-many game. In other words it does a lot of things and does them well but it is also one that is prone to not being exactly what people want and falls short in some areas but excels in others.

(Unchanged from 7 1st ed)
So far, we've played 2 incomplete campaigns of Descent 2nd, as well as the full co-op campaign.  In general, I like it more than the 1st edition, but it has introduced new problems as much as it's fixed things.  

So, the good: there's been a crapload of simplification.  This has hit pretty much everywhere.  Special skills and abilities are gone, replaced with a new class system.   The whole separation between town & dungeon (teleporting between them) has been done away with.  Threat and special spawning is gone, though the overlord's deck and its customization remains.  The campaign's been trimmed down, so you no longer wander about freely on this huge map, but instead proceed along a branching storyline, hitting specific story missions and some side ones.  The overlord similarly doesn't have to worry about sieging towns and moving his lieutenants, but just winning the missions he's fighting (and still upgrading his guys).  I could go on, but they've streamlined so much.

There's new ideas, too!  Your characters have a special ability and an archetype, and you then select a specific class from within that archetype.  The class determines what kinds of things your guy will be doing.  For instance: If you're a blue (support) type, you could be an alchemist tossing potions at people, or a bard buffing your team with passive songs, or a more traditional cleric-type healer.  If you're a yellow (caster) type, you could become a necromancer and move your skeleton figure around attacking things, or you could be a geomancer who kind of does similarly but with summoned stones, or the more classic runemaster who just blasts things with magic.  Of course, only so many of these classes are in the base game, so if you want more choices, you'll need to invest in the expansions.  
Once you've picked your class, that sets up your base ability that you tend to build off of, as well as starting equipment.  As you level up, you get exp, which you can spend to unlock more abilities (there are a couple each of 1-, 2-, and 3-cost skills).  Some of them make your base skill stronger in some way, others give you new attacks and such.

The campaign is now built into the game, instead of being an expansion add-on, which is a big change.

Now the not-so-good.  There are just a couple things from the old version that I miss.  Being able to use the special orders was situational, but often very powerful.  Now the ability to react during the enemy's turn (or even defend) is gone.

With the above changes has come one regarding hero deaths.  Instead of respawning back in town, and the overlord being rewarded with points, your figure is KOed on the space it was occupying.  You can take your entire next turn to stand back up, or an adjacent friend can take one action to revive you.  This is all fine.  However, when you stand back up, you roll 2 red dice and get back that much HP & stamina.  This is usually around 5 HP (as low as 3 or as much as 6), and 1 stamina (if you're lucky).  That's fine in the early game, but woefully inadequate later on.  Instead of threat or points, the overlord gets to draw a card when he KOs someone.  So, in later missions, if a weaker or weakened hero is ever even slightly exposed, they can get mobbed with enemies and killed in short order.  Then, they're left with no option but to stand back up, get killed, stand back up, over and over.  This is really not fun, nor is it good design.
Which leads me on to the next point about balance.  Some of the hero classes I talked about above seem crappy, but are actually quite useful in practice (the bard, for instance).  Others seem crappy because they are.  There's a big difference in power between some of the class types.  
As noted earlier, the overlord has deck specializations he can go into, and these have similar disparities.  Traps seem pretty lackluster, while the weapon mastery (I forget what it's really called) has some crazy combos in it.  For instance, you can put a couple of cards in your deck that add extra damage to your monsters' attack rolls.  S, our overlord, quickly noticed that these return to your hand if you spend a surge during the attack, and there's another card that adds a surge to your attack..  So, after a few turns of drawing (the OL's deck is only 20 cards), he can begin spamming this card that gives [i]every[/i] monster attack 2 extra dmg, and he'll never lose it unless he gets a series of spectacularly bad die rolls.  2 may not sound like much, but trust me, its hard to stay alive under that kind of assault.

Oh, and while I'm thinking about it, there's some really perverse incentives created by the monster spawning system.  The old one had you running around trying to cover all the sight lines, while the new one has defined spawn points.  But the old one also had a cost to respawn things, while the new one gives the OL one every turn, for free.  So in a bizarre way, you don't always want to kill the monsters.  If it's your last character's turn, you've just come into this new area and none of the monsters in it have died yet, plus everyone else has just spent time moving/healing or tried to attack but only wounded things, there's zero point in you trying to kill something.  If you do, it'll just come back to life at the end of the round, at full health.  If you can't wipe all of them out in one go, it might be better to wound/incapacitate and try it next turn.  This is especially true if the monster group is one of the larger, tougher ones, and doubly so if you're killing off a red one.  (Monster groups have 1 or more white basic type and a red one with better stats.  The OL gets to bring back any one thing he wants, so he'll always choose the red one of the strongest group he's got.)  I really feel like there should be some kind of cooldown on these things, like each individual figure has to sit out a turn before respawning, or a red one costs more to bring back than a white.  Conversely, perhaps the OL should get some compensation if the heroes haven't killed anything and he's entitled to a respawn, but everything's still on the map.  

They've completely messed with the way that missions work, and how they're balanced.  In some ways this is an improvement, since you always have story-specific goals and it's not just a grind-fest of trying to get as many hero kills as possible while delaying their advance as long as possible.  However, they've replaced the effective timer that was threat and monster spawning (the longer you took, the more you'd have to fight) with these artificial timers.  I wouldn't mind as much, except [i]every single mission[/i] has one.  It's always "you have 3 turns to get across the bridge", or "you have to save this guy before he's eaten by zombies", or "you've got to make it to the treasure before the villain does".  There's always some type of race, even if the timer isn't fixed and explicit.  Worse, it's clear that some of these weren't very well-considered.  Time and again, we've run into situations where the overlord can accomplish his goal easily, whether by playing a card that gets him an extra move or simply by virtue of the scenario design.  Now, the heroes can move to block these efforts (in some cases), or exert themselves to try and win in a hurry, but they have to know what they're doing.  Going into a scenario blind, with just the instructions from the manual, it's really tough to anticipate these twists and win.  
Worse, some of them are completely luck-based.  There are quite a number where you have to find a needle in a haystack, or at least the right token out of a facedown set of 6, or the right room of 3 possible places something might be hidden.  If you get lucky and it's in the first place you look, you're set up to win, but if it's in the last place, you're pretty much screwed.  
Other scenarios revolve around making attribute tests to do things, and if you've got the wrong mix of heroes or just get unlucky in your rolls, you can forget about winning.
Now, I will say that there are some of these that we've looked at and said "this is impossible",  but it's turned out to be very close.  So maybe there are times when my judgement of the balance is off.  Or perhaps we just got lucky to make it that far.  There have also been scenarios where we've felt the same way and it's turned out exactly as we predicted, an easy waltz to the win for the overlord with nothing we could do to stop it.
The final point I'll make is that most of the missions are designed in 2 parts.  In the first, you're introduced to the adventure and make it into the area to confront the first challenge.  Whichever side wins the first half doesn't get a real reward, instead they get a bonus or penalty when it comes to the 2nd half of the mission.  The first halves may also be the most skewed, in my experience.  So if you can't beat the odds in the 1st part, you'll be facing even steeper ones in the 2nd.

We have had successful, contested, interesting campaigns despite these issues.  But we have also had at least one that turned into a downward spiral for  the heroes.  If the overlord wins, he's that much more likely to keep winning.  And although both sides get Exp (&/or money) regardless of the outcome, the winner will get more, and be in a stronger position next time.  So, I think if the OL plays to win and is cutthroat about it, and the heroes don't know the missions in advance, you can easily slip into that death funnel without realizing it.(Unchanged from 7 1st ed)

RATING: 5.47
The game is beautiful, miniatures are, like in many other FFG games, awesomely done and modular board components are perfect. However, the game itself is too simple and too shallow and out of the place. Some rules are simply ridiculous (e.g. movement or line of sight) and game can easily become too meta for my taste. And lieutenants are not even figures but mere tokens. They can be bought for $10 a piece. 
What could have been great table top RPG turned to be dice rolling hack 'n' slash with zero role playing. Something like D&D4e. And it's Terrinoth again. Give up FFG, Terrinoth will never be a thing! On other side, it's tons of fun for ten-year-olds.
To sum up: I am really happy to own this game as components themselves are worth it. It is an awesome tool for your own RPG campaign design in any slightly more serious setting.

Shorter and easier than the original. Im tempted to say this is the option of choice if your looking for DnD light, a dungeon crawl with bite, but light rules. I've only played the first scenario, but it presented a good asymmetrical game. I think both descent games suffer from the player being immortal, bit sucks a lot of tension out of the game and the story with it. In this sense i think Mansions of Madness is possibly better.

However, I do plenty of Roleplaying and don't really feel the need to play dungeon crawl board games other than Dungeon Quest.

If you've got any sort of vague interest in role playing in dungeons and dragons or pathfinder - do yourself a favour and pick up Descent 2 instead. You'll save a bucket of money, and probably have more fun with this anyhow.

Descent is a stripped down dungeon crawling rpg crammed into a board game. Stripped down, because the rules are so simple they just make sense. This is a crowning achievement for any board game.

What makes Descent special? The scenario book.
Every scenario is a brilliantly creative little adventure that plays out in about an hour, maybe an hour and a half. Including explaining the rules to new comers. Unbelievable hey?

The sorts of things that happen during your scenarios:
-The heroes are trying to run through a canyon, while the overlord rains boulders down to try and hem them in
-The heroes are at a masquerade ball, trying to uncover cultists while escorting guests to safety
-The overlord is trying to march his necro-dragon across the bridge, before the heroes can destroy his phylactery

Very, very rarely does a scenario boil down to "kill everything that moves, get a key."

Super solid game, recommended. I need to play more of this.

Edit 16/12/2015
Downrated to 8.0
We've been playing through the campaign included in the base box. Game has a severe issue with 'Quarterbacking' - dominant players effectively taking other players turns away. Mission variety is good, but not balanced - there are some missions that are clearly unwinnable from one side or the other. Balance for competitive play is difficult. We've house ruled in the LoS rules from Imperial Assault (one corner from attacker to two corners of defender) and that's been working well.
Overall this is still a great game. However I'm a bit burnt out from it, and it is starting to feel repetitive.

UPDATE: This game really cam alive for us with the app. Co-op is our preferred way to play to the point that I can’t remember the last time we played Overlord style. I also recommend using Redjak’s variants (found in the forum) if you want to play the published campaigns co-op. Super fun.

I liked the first edition of Descent but found it way too cumbersome and unwieldy. This streamlines it so that you can actually play a scenario without it being an eight-hour undertaking so it's much more likely to get played.

A nice departure from the norm as this game is very episodic.  Players can take their characters from the beginning of the story of Descent all the way to the end which will take you about as many hours as a standard RPG would or you can choose a place and jump in medias res.  Fun to play and looking forward to expansions in the future.

25 years ago I would of thought this game was cool as spit, but I'm afraid my tastes have changed.

The game is really put together well, but in the end you are just smashing your GiJoe figures together. Great kids stuff, but not adult fare.

I still prefer the open-ended gameplay of Runebound. I was not a fan of the predetermined layout system, I would rather explore as I play.

I dunno, in the end I was not sold on it, but I can understand why some gamers like this sort of thing.

After 4 Plays: First and second game were fun and promising. But soon it became more or less the same lame structure. Two times we had a never ending story with no tension at all - so we cancelled the game.

I was hopeful to find a better version of Descent. But after all these games we are fed up with this. Even more endless fights.

Eigther the games seem to be extremly short and mainly dependent on the results of the dice. Or they become endless fights with no fun. Isn' it possible to create a rpg boardgame that is not about pure fighting?

Yes: I prefer Earth Reborn instead!

Oh, Descent.  I'm a big fan of the first edition.  Unfortunately, this is based on just a couple of plays.  The big problem was in the long play time, and the game was just so hard for me to get to the table.  While this Second Edition cuts out a lot of the detail that I like, it's in service to a 2 hour playing time, and includes great campaign play out of the box.  So, I'm going to give this edition a higher rating than the first edition.  I'm glad FFG produced the compatibility pack, as at least the characters and miniatures are brought forward into the new edition.

Veteran of Doom; Rating after about four quests.

Pros:
+Streamlined Play, quests under 2.5 hrs 
+Simple to Learn, Hard to Master Tactics
+Numerous Quests
+Great Miniatures

Huge Con:
-Most people expect a more evenly paced hack and slash, where this game is just a race to the objectives hardcore, to the extent of frequently ignoring monsters

I really thought I would like Descent 2e, thinking that a competitive dungeon crawler would be right up my alley, but I was disappointed. Descent 2e strikes an uneasy balance between being a full-fledged RPG and being a straight-up board game, and I find I'd rather play D&D proper if we have the necessary time and the group commitment or just Castle Ravenloft if we do not.

Descent 2ed. looked like a good game to me until the moment I played first edition. It opened my eyes. It is pretty shocking how bad 2nd editon is compared to 1st. Instead of epic dungeon crawl we have lame racing game, instead of huge game enhancing expansions we have new, lame, DLC like, money milking FFG policy. It is truly dissapointing where FFG is heading. After playing 1st edition, 2nd edition looks like utter dissapointment. It is ok game, at most, comparing to its glorious predecessor.

This was one of my first "designer" games, and helped get me into gaming in general. I don't play it nearly as much as I used to (although the app helped), and I'm starting to wonder if it has been replaced for me.

If I did decide to play a campaign again soon, I think I'd go back to OL v Heroes campaign as opposed to the app.

Update: We started another OL campaign. I still have an alright time, but it just doesn't shine like it used to.

RATING: 4
More streamlined and generally better than the first [thing=17226]Descent[/thing]. Cool miniatures. Actually playing the game is fun, but setup can take really long. You need a dungeon master who is well prepared and (optimally) sets up the game in advance.

I found out that I'm not a player who enjoys campaign style games. The reason being that you need to play the game with the same group of people. I played the game quite a few times with 3 players and managed to get a level 8 character. But every time you play with a different group of players, you have to start all over again. Especially when you have new players, you end up playing the same scenarios multiple times and I didn't find this exciting at all.

Another problem with the game I had was that while I generally really like when you're able to level up, I didn't really find the powers themselves that great. I never had the feeling that I want to buy them all but don't have enough experience points. Most of them are pretty mediocre so saving up was always an easy choice.

Lastly, I absolutely hate the 'X' on the blue die. The blue die doesn't deal that much damage to begin with and having a critical miss side that cancels out all your other dice is infuriating. This means 1/6 of all your rolls will be misses and this isn't fun to me. They could have made it a '0' side, which would have been bad as well but you could still make the roll if you got lucky. Alternatively, they could have used a critical hit side as a counterbalance. This would have made the game more random but possibly more exciting.

In conclusion, I think it ultimately comes down to having the same group to play with regularely so you can really enjoy the campaign and all of the expansions. Because I think when you can minimize setup through proper preparation and have a fun crowd it overshadows the other downsides of the game.

My group and I played a yearlong Descent v1 campaign using Road to Legend. I went from loving the game to loathing it. The big problem with Descent v1 was how the Overlord would activate all his guys at once and pick off one guy (often strolling by others; [i]ta ta![/i]) until he was knocked out. Then repeat. This was THE way for the OL to play every scenario as it worked. And the downtime waiting for him to maximize his 10+ dudes and cards was annoying. It felt imbalanced in terms of both power and fun. Throw in lots of rules ambiguities and the fun got sucked out, and we simply ended things prematurely because nobody was having fun.

Then SW:IA comes along and, as wary as I am, I'm convinced to try it -- and lo and behold, I find it fixes just about everything I hated about Descent. The one-at-a-time monster group activation vs all-at-once is brilliant so turns go much more quickly and things feel much more balanced (no more monster parade of suffering 12 attacks before your next turn). We meet monthly for a 1vMany campaign. So, when Descent v2 was announced, one of my friends picks up and we start playing a coop campaign using the app. I’m in love again! 

But something is bothering me about these games. I leave my sessions fried after 4+ hours of parsing out permutations of movements and actions to find the best one because the result always comes down to the dice anyway. I don’t feel that the player agency is commensurate with the effort required. You can figure out the best order of moves all you want, but the dice will determine the story told. 

Furthermore, the key to the game is not exploring a dungeon but racing to get to the next phase of the mission. You don’t clear a room and loot the chest, you just kill what’s in the way and keep moving. The app has a built-in timer that lets you know you’re not progressing as quickly as you should and penalizes you for going too slow (we always go too slowly). It’s antithetical to how I want the experience to be. I want a dungeon crawl where I get to immerse myself in a story, explore a dungeon, and kill a bunch of monsters, not race to reach objective points.

Rating dropped from a 9 to a 5 after several plays. It's OK, but this is no longer the only game in town. I'm looking at Gloomhaven for a true dungeon crawl experience.

A great remake of the classic, Beautiful components as per usual from Fantasy Flight. A great experience to play.
It is much more engaging for the Overlord now as well.

The trouble I have found with it is that with two plays of mission 1 (Fat Goblin) the heroes have moved a total of 10 spaces between them after two plays of both parts of the mission. I hope this changes.
*Edit* Turns out I had miss understood the rules and was putting far too many monsters in. It is now sorted and the games are great.

Played as a two-player game. With only two heroes, it didn't take much for the hero player to feel over-whelmed. (Even with fewer monsters, the Overlord seemed to have an advantage.)

Also, the hero player got pissed because after she won Encounter 1, she lost the second encounter and felt like all her good work up top was for naught.

Still, with the simplified rule set and the shorter dungeons, we were able to play quite a bit in only 3 hours (the intro and an entire Act 1 mission.)

I'm interested in playing again, but I think I'll always use 4 heroes from now on, even if I'm playing 2 players.

D&D in a box. Which unfortunately limits its appeal to our D&D playing group-- hard to make a case for it when everyone knows how to play the real thing, especially since it takes just about as long to set up and play. Great when mixing rpg-players and non-rpg-players in a gaming group though.

Have only read through the rules, however it seems that second edition fixed a fair number of the issues with 1st edition.  Trimmed a lot of the fat.

A really great alternative to D&D, and an excellent RPG adventure board game overall. The character creation is fun, even if more limited than I'd like to see. As far as gameplay is concerned, the die rolls can be quite frustrating when you get a bad string of X's. Also, there are alot of wonky rules that can cause strange rulings questions to arise. However, none of these gripes ever took away from the overall enjoyment of the game. Well done; Lots of fun!

I had to adjust my mindset when playing this game. Normally when I play a game I'm very cautious to keep my heros alive and healthy. You can't play this way in this game, the heros / characters are expendable and are expected to die to advance the quest. Keep the focus on the mission and all else be damned.

[u]The Good[/u]: Everything drips with the cool Descent fantasy theme. The stuff inside will have you drooling before you can even get it out of the box.

[u]The Bad[/u]: Players are relegated to using un-fun tactics in order to win. Overlord will end up being a Gamemaster, instead of a true opponent. Many Quests have balance issues, and often the result is a landslide in such a way that neither side ends up having fun.

[u]The Bottomline[/u]: Nothing like its predecessor; after its great metamorphosis, the end result -to our group- was a game that came came up well short of the land of the fun.

Given the success of campaign games such as Pandemic legacy in out group a lot is expected of Descent, and I personally feel it sort of failed to deliver.

The app intergration for XCOM, and to a lesser extent Mansions of Madness (2nd ed.) are awesome as they teach you to play from scratch, however here we found the app teaches player who know how to play descent how to play descent with the app- a subtle distinction maybe- but we spent A LOT of time having to double check the rule book for clarifications- on the plus side the rulebook index is pretty good.

Maybe it was simply because it was the training/tutorial mission we played but I found it very simple with no room for tactics of strategy and incredibly easy, posing almost no challenge at all. Dissappointing :soblue:

Spent too long trying to decide on the right rating for this game. The game itself is sound. I like the rules, i like the theme, the mechanics are excellent and playing any given turn is fun... But the quests/scenarios (I.e. the campaign) is HORRIBLY inbalanced. I've played games where I got to do NOTHING for turn after turn as the others players would kill all my pieces before my turn, and they'd then kill my reinforcements before I got to activate them. Later in the campaign the hero's have a near impossible task to survive, let alone complete a mission. After 3-4 month of play, the final battle pretty much then came down to a coin toss. Make the roll, Hero's win, fail to kill my monster and I win... on a single die roll.
I lost... and I think I had more fun than the hero players did... and I was misserable! I hope that FFG can fix the balance issues because I SO want this game to work. It should be a 9/10 rated game, but due to the balance issues it's a 3/10 (hence entering it as a 5 overall).

Pros
-Campaign mode that retains outcomes of each quest
-Character grow over time and can gain new equipment or abilities after each quest
-Use of unique dice in combat
-High quality components and well supported game

Cons
-Awkward respawning rules and lack of benefit for killing monsters leads to a more "run for the objective" style than the expected dungeon crawler/brawl
-Need to constantly rebuild the game map after every quest
-Very swingy campaign mode. Winners tend to win more as they get more bonuses after each victory.
-Combat is fully dice / luck
-Long down time for individual hero players (since Overlord has more to do).

This would have been rated at least a 7, except that I am setting up my list after having both Imperial Assault and Warhammer Quest: Adventure Card Game.  Imperial Assault is essentially Descent: 3rd edition, with better rules, alternating activations and just a cleaner, more engaging experience for all players.  Plus, skirmish mode.  
The only thing IA doesn't have is a medieval fantasy theme, and while I LOVE Star Wars (look at my collection), sometimes I need something else.  Cue Warhammer Quest: ACG. It's a fantasy dungeon crawler without all the hoopla.  A fun, quick experience that ultimately means Descent gathers dust.

Nicely trimmed version of the original Descent. Several features I disliked have now been remodeled or completely removed. Like teleporting to town in the middle of an encounter. The quests are also much shorter, which is good news if your game group doesn't have time for 4-hour quests.

+ Campaign ready out of the box

This is my gaming group's pre-Gloomhaven go-to campaign game.  We play all kinds of different games, but not a lot of time goes by before someone asks, "When are we going to play another Descent campaign?"  I've picked up every single expansion for this game and will continue to as we just can't seem to get enough of this one.

Also can't say enough good things about the Road To Legend app, which makes the game more narrative and fully co-op.  Granted, it's really not the same challenge as facing a human overlord, but having full co-op as an option was most welcome.

Határozottan jobban tetszett már elsőre, mint az előd. Jó lenne már végre egy jó dc játék, és ez talán elhozza ezt nekünk. Érezhetően egyszerűsödött a játékmenet, kevesebb a macera. Nincsenek kincsek menet közben, hála az égnek, így nem tápolódnak szénné karakterek a party végére. Cserébe van egész jónak tűnő karakterfejlődés a partyk között. A tábla is sokkal hangulatosabb.

I love this game, but it is long. I have been playing a campaign with friends but since each quest takes so long we do not have time to play more that one quest per day. And since we are all adults with families, and don't live close to each other we can only play once every few months or so. This means that we have been playing for about a year and have not completed the campaign.

An improvement over the original in every way. Campaign-style presentation gives the game re-playability. The Overlord's goal is varied and never as simple as 'kill all heroes' (until the finale of the campaign, at least). Great tactical play akin to scenario-based skirmish games.

I enjoy the streamlined mechanisms of the second edition much better than the first. I also feel that the scenarios are much more varied and therefore interesting and they have a certain puzzle like nature where you can really plan out a strategy instead of just going exploring.

Wow! Everything just works. Less is more! Compared to the first edition, Descent 2E has fewer miniatures and a lot less chrome (rules, components). The bloat was taken out but the game hasn't been stripped back to a bland, abstract game. There's still some tactical crunch here.

I read ahead to the next scenario and so far, the scenario design looks solid. I also like the effort put into the narrative.

I'm excited and I can't wait to get this back on the table to continue my solitaire campaign, but I'm also looking forward to teaching my kids to play. (If my son ever forgives me for turning his character into a monkey when we played the first edition :p)

First impression rating: 8+. A keeper.

This game lends itself to so many memorable moments. The campaigns are a blast. Some say the quests can be lopsided in favor of one side or another, but really without that the quest selection system wouldn't mean anything. My wife and I still talk about all of the close calls and massive twists in battle from our first campaign. An experience and worth the investment.

I love this game for its tactical elements and the fact that it can be played bot 1vsPlayers or full cooperative with the aid of the "Road to Legend" app - even in Solo mode.
It is a classic dungeon crawler, reminiscent of the early versions of D&D, storytelling is limited but possible but the focus of the game is definitely on slash&loot.
It is a great gateway to boardgames for fantasy roleplayers.
The missions can be one shots or connected into a larger campaign, with the characters powering up and acquiring new gear.
The custom dice mechanic to resolve combats is brilliant and great fun.

Un juego que está bien, pero si no buscas exploración y aventura (rasgos indicados en la ficha de BGG pero que son inexistentes). Es un buen juego de estrategia, muy táctico en el que debes gestionar bien lo que tienes, y los recursos y refuerzos si eres el Señor Supremo. Eso sí, es de fantasía y las minis, así como cartas... son magníficas.

I like the archetypes and how you can choose from the two classes in each archetype. I like being able to equip weapons that provide you with different offensive/defensive options. I like that there is LOS. Having an Overlord control the events, traps, and monsters makes the game feel less mechanized than D&D:WoA. However, when playing it seems like an unfair advantage swings back and forth between the heroes and the Overlord, depending on which scenario you play. The other thing I wish Descent had was the randomly-generated dungeon mechanic that is in WoA. It adds to the feeling of exploration, instead of having the map already laid out before you. My gaming group is halfway through the campaign now and everyone is loving it. Going to have to get all of the expansions. I'd like to be able to play through the campaign again some time as one of the adventurers.

I appreciate the accessibility of this game and the design elements that respect the player's time in comparison to 1st edition where trips to the rulebook were much too frequent. Seemingly small things -- like the status effect cards with descriptions or explanations of monster abilities on the actual monster cards -- are welcome modifications that make the game easier to play.

On the other hand I think it cut too deeply into the Descent formula and made it unrecognizable as a [i]dungeon crawl[/i]. It's now mostly a tactical race, which isn't what I was initially looking for in Descent. I imagine the designers saw that the main complaint against first edition was the play time and therefore focused most of the revisions toward speeding the play. In doing this, they refined things more in the direction of Descent's predecessor [thing=10640]Doom[/thing]: a less interesting tactical rush system.

So first edition, especially [thing=29298][/thing], still has a definite place in my collection. I'll probably be getting rid of second edition soon. 

Edit: Sold. Boring.

[b][i]Descent 2e[/i][/b] is perhaps the simplest complicated game I've ever played. By this I mean it isn't a simple game (it's got a lot of rules), but after you learn the game the rules fade into the background and you're left focusing on the characters and quest objectives. The great thing about this is you don't spend the game thinking things such as, "This figure has line of sight to these 4 squares with a 70% chance to hit." Instead, you automatically translate the game into narrative terms, "The goblin can see this entire corridor and will probably hit my weakly defended healer." This happens because the rules are clear cut, make sense, and are easy to remember.

The only two times I find myself wishing for a little extra complication (or at least something different) is when characters get knocked out (which is fairly mild in consequence) and when characters visit the store (I'd prefer equipment was limited by class, even though this would require an extensive table describing exactly who can equip what). In all other things, including the much maligned line of sight rules, I agree that FFG made the right calls to produce a fun, exciting, and tactical dungeon crawler.

One last item worthy of mention is the quest and character advancement system. Traveling, leveling, shopping, alternate Act 2 quests, etc. are all a total blast.

Out of my entire collection, I have spent the most time with Descent 2.0

But not playing it...

Lemme explain.

I've wanted so terribly to love this game and for it to work with my group. I have proxy miniatures for the old monsters, all personally painted
But...
It just doesn't work for me. Every time I've played it, it's somewhat dull. It doesn't give me a D & D feel. No exploration. No fear of death by the heroes. Just not enough tension or choices.
It seems to me it's very "set". You walk through the motions. There is usually only one path and one way to accomplish it. It's very straightforward.
I don't know how to phrase it but it just doesn't work (for me).
Like I said I have spend countless days trying to devise a way to use all of these components and cards to make a neat "D & D" experience but to no avail.

It has become my nemisis.

Hopefully one day I will find a way to enjoy this game.
But saidly, it's seems as though I am just walking through a preset story that I can customize.

I can see this being a lot of fun with younger kids as myself being the overlord.

It gets a five cause of the components and the hope I can find a way to use it.

RATING: 8.5
Not your standard hack n’ slash dungeon crawler.  Nice blend of fantasy-style questing and character building with light elements of role-playing.  Descent can be played either as a 2-hour game or a 20-hour campaign (I prefer the campaign for the best immersion experience).  Objective-based quests make no two campaigns the same.  Interesting Overlord mechanics keep this game competitive and interactive for the game master (if you like being the game master that is).  Beautiful miniatures and modular map tiles.  For appreciation of what it truly is (a tactical skirmisher, NOT a classic dungeon crawler), IMO Descent 2nd edition is a fantasy-theme gamer's dream come true.  Check out Nerdook's and RedJak's variants for even more ways to play this game.  As of 2017 I owe all the expansions and hero & monster packs.

I hated the first edition of this game and had hope for the second. I must say, that I'm loving the new edition. They've addressed most of the problems from the first edition and game play seems more balanced and the game plays a lot faster too.

Finally it feels more like a dungeon romp instead of a race. Especially with the very well done campaign rules, that are built into the game this time and no more constant monster spawns all over the place, forcing you to run instead of fighting, though that option is still available if needed.

I was also quite impressed with all of the scenarios included in the base game. I'm definitely looking forward to more plays of this.

I like it! They streamlined the more fiddly parts of the first, the missions are very thematic and it plays fairly quickly. The campaign is decent and you probably don't have to spend 100+ hours to complete it.

Sort of like taking the social/non-combat aspect out of a Dungeons and Dragons campaign, with limited character generation. The persistent campaign feature is fun and makes for a nice arc of gameplay across sessions.

Some of the abilities and quests seem a little unbalanced, such as Scamper for goblins. It may vary by play, but it can leave you feeling cheated, or that an encounter is futile.

The game hits the right balance between story driven scenarios (each sensibly tuned to give the players a good impression of what the scene is supposed to be), tactical combat and various power richness.

Every hero class plays quite differently, but at the same time they all belong to one of four archetypes (Healer, Fighter, Mage, Rogue), giving flexibility, variety AND reliability. 

No scenario is even similar to the others, and playing the same scenario twice with different heroes and monsters feels like a totally new experience.

2 players with the full complements of 4 heroes gives a wonderful playing.

Loads better than first edition. The most impressive part, I think, is how they shrunk the experience into bite-sized pieces while still keeping the balance interesting. Now, when you play, a very interesting thing happens: BOTH sides feel like the other side has a major advantage over them. And every few turns, you pull something off that alleviates that feeling for a turn. So you have this constant back-and-forth of having the upper hand. It's great! The missions are also way more dynamic now, the rules are simpler and more intuitive, they cut out a lot of unecessary mechanics. They basically fixed or improved everything.

Here's the thing.  I've played this once and it was fun.  However, I can't find ANYONE that is willing to play this again.  I'm willing to part with the following as a package: Runebound (and 2 expansions), DungeonQuest, Descent 2nd ed. and the Descent mod thingie that lets you use Runebound and 1st ed. stuff as a trade in for a good clump of games that are on my "want in trade" list.  The deal has to be good though and I prefer local trades.  Hit me up if you think you got a deal I couldn't refuse.

4-25-2013: Trade Pending.

8/14/2013: I've traded this some time back, but upon reflection I regret that a little.  I'd like to re-acquire this game and give it another try.  I mean, it's pretty much the most (relatively) accessible rpg(ish) board game available these days.

I was more excited about this game than any other, being a big fan of 1st edition, and in particular Road to Legends. We have played 2nd edition about half way through Act 2. I hate to say it, but I don't like this game, which is mind boggling in a way considering all the glowing reviews. I play with my wife, who considers 1st edition (RtL) to be one of her top three favorite games. I am playing the Overlord (as usual) with her as the heroes. I am massively pulling my punches, and I usually don't even play cards, and she is having a horrendous time winning any of the encounters. Combat plays almost no part if you want to be successful as the heroes, due to many of the encounters having time constraints, unfair Overlord advantages with abilities, and movement rules that can block areas so one side flat out can't complete an objective (I spend much of each game thinking that I'm glad I'm the Overlord as I would be frustrated as hell as the heroes). I think I'm going to shelf this one and see what expansions come out. Very important: This is NOT a more streamlined version of the original game. It is a different game all together, and we probably would have enjoyed it if it was marketed as such.

It would be a bummer if the second edition was worse than the first one. Luckily this is an improvement in many regards. Right now, I just want to try out the campaign for the game.

[i]Easier, but not dumbed down[/i]
The game has in many ways been streamlined. Some has to do with better graphic design; like that there are not a ton of referencing the rule book for special abilities and reduced clutter on the board. There is also less bookkeeping and counting up in the game, with fewer dice, changed surge rules and easier overlord threat and deck management. All changes considered this makes the game not only easier to pick up for new players, but also more fast-paced with experienced ones.

[i]Shorter missions and slower progression[/i]
Missions are parted in usually two encounters where the first one is staging up how hard the second one is. The game is not just about killing the adventurers or the end boss anymore which is really refreshing. Some encounters are over in three turns which I find too short as they can be over before one of sides can really react, but you can’t longer go from newbie to superhero in one mission either. I don’t find it excusable that they don’t seem to be balanced with all number of players. This makes me believe that this game is mainly for campaign play.

RATING: 7
It's Descent, only quicker. I didn't miss the stuff that got taken out. Seems like there is a lot of mobility and not a lot of conditions that slow down or block players so it feels a bit like a fast break all the time. Still a grinder, just a quicker grinder, if that makes sense. It has grown over me with time. I still think the majority of the 1st Edition's problems were with scenario design (rather than mechanics) but I certainly don't miss original edition tedium like warping back to town in the middle of a dungeon fight for a shopping trip. If I were getting back into Descent (or playing for the first time) this would be the edition-of-choice.

My attitude has always been, why not just pull out a role playing book, or a better tactical minis game, and do it right? Indeed, that was my feeling about the original Descent, with its slogging night-long gameplay. 

Yet Descent 2.0 just begs to be played with. The dice are wonky, the attribute tests are off-balance, and the minis have so many belts on! So many belts and buckles and little fanny packs! Yet at every dice roll I find myself standing up and cheering in a way I don't for Earth Reborn. And I get invested in the characters as they develop through campaigns, the same way those little monkeys in that experiment got attached to their lifeless, wire-cage mothers.

Update, October 2014: Okay, so if it's not a great game, why do I keep buying expansions for it? 1) Because it's a relatively cheap way to collect and paint plastic miniatures 2) Because I keep thinking I'm going to produce a game my group likes to play out of it. 

Judging by the vast number of attempted variants in the listing for this game, I suspect there's a bad feedback loop happening whereby we keep giving money to a company that doesn't care whether we're having fun or not, in an effort to get them to care about whether we're having fun or not.

And still  there's a sick part of me thinking, maybe they got it right with Imperial Assault? Ugh.

See my review for Imperial Assault. In short, my opinion of this game has fallen so precipitously as to have become kind of weird.

Played mainly as Overlord whilst introducing new players to the system. Fun hack and slash dungeon crawl. Easy rules, but good enough for what the game is. Large monster movement rules a little weird. Hope to play through entire core campaign. Have purchased all the current expansions, so I guess that says something...

Words cannot describe how head-over-heels I am for this game. The artwork, the models (although not pre-painted), the rpg elements, the built-in questline, the two sides that play so differently...it all sings. The replay value here is enormous.

My biggest gaming disappointment for a long time. This is a theme-heavy game without any atmosphere, and a tactical combat game without any interesting decisions.

The tactics are blindingly obvious. Heroes: rush the objectives. Overlord: block the heroes' path by putting monsters at the very obvious choke points. Scenario balance is wildly off to the point where one side cannot conceivably stand a chance in some scenarios; this is particularly an issue in campaign play, where one side's early success can quickly snowball into an unassailable lead. None of this would matter if it was still fun, but it isn't: there's just no game of any note in here.

The components are nice, but even this has a downside: there are far too many superfluous counters. This means that set up time is far, far too long for such a simplistic ("move and roll") game. IMO the nice miniatures undermine the theme, as it seems the designers went for having a wide variety of creatures, but that just  means you end up with unconvincing (silly) combinations of monsters teaming up (justified by an evil overlord controlling them, I suppose, but this contributes to the lack of atmosphere).

It's a shame, as FFG clearly put a lot of thought into the missions and campaign mode, and tried hard to improve and streamline the original. Ultimately, though, it's just horribly broken (and I'm not someone who throws that term around very often).

Compared to first edition, I like the simplification of many of the rules, especially clarification of actions and simplification of power dice. Game flow is increased. In concept, the time-limited and goal-based scenarios should increase thematic feel, but I found quite the opposite when playing the game. Players are rushed thru scenes and dungeon crawl feel of the game is diminished. I think these types of encounters, if limited, are a nice addition, but encountering them every time gets tiresome. In short, I like the stream-lined rules and campaign capability. I don't care for the time-based scenarios that resemble a puzzle more than a dungeon.

This is pretty fun, but I'd like to know the best player set up. I'm thinking if two players both control two heroes, I think it would be the best way for all 3 players to get the most out of the game. Otherwise, the Overlord gets to have all the fun, while the players get their meager 2 actions. 
I've discovered I'm not a good Overlord because I'm still too interested in what the players are doing and I'm rooting for them!  The next time I play I'll try to be more aggressive. 
---
So I've played a full campaign now as the Overlord and the finale was pretty anticlimactic. The heroes (4 played by 2) easily immobilized Splig in the first encounter and pummeled him on their second turn. And then, before the grand battle really even began, my master shadow dragon opened the door where outside the heroes gathered and in 2 firey breaths killed all of them. Dead. Game over. 
Dice games, eh?
---
Conceptually I would rate this game a 10. The components, the heroes, the overlord role, the gear and abilities, the campaign mode, the dice...and oh, the dice. 
In theory, they're an amazing way to randomize attacking and defending.  However, the dice seem to make or break any tactical advantages or disadvantages players gain through clever play. And the scenarios, though varied, seem oddly imbalanced. This might just be a design feature, so the heroes and overlord both get better opportunities to win even when the odds are against them, but it makes some adventures much less fun to play.  I love this game, but only between sessions, thinking about the game, reading some of the class cards, and checking out expansions. A 10 rating when I'm looking at the game, but a 6 or maybe 7 while I'm playing, oddly.  I still can't gel but want all the expansions.

Gorgeous components, very nice Quest and Rules guides, and so very quick to play for a board-based RPG. The play time (after setup) has been 30 minutes to 1 hour tops, which is perfect for my younger players who don't want to get hung up for three or four hours with a standard RPG.

One (big) complaint is that, like others have said, the rules as printed make this a race, and whoever does things faster wins. Another is that the scenario fiction of the game leaves me and my players cold. In fact, my players asked me to rewrite the fiction or they were just going to bag it.

While the rules as written (and scenario setup) are great at times, other times my players and I just want to explore. We've agreed on revised rules that still use the quest setup but totally alter the game goals to allow exploration. I wish the designers had included this style of play in the game.

The figures paint up beautifully.

I've heard the complaints about imbalance (in favor of both sides interesting enough), and even agree with certain points of the argument, but I still love Descent.  A fantasy themed, 1 vs many co-op dungeon delver, with a campaign mode and great looking components just tickles my fancy.  Painting the miniatures and using them along with the dungeon tiles and online quest editor for Pathfinder games is an added bonus to the utility of these components.

Me and my wife liked playing the tutorial quest in the Road to Legend app. The app has some really bad UX flaws but those do not take the joy of the game.

The idea of discovering tiles as you move through the dungeon (when playing with the app) is something that I absolutely LOVE, just like MoM.

The game itself is a bit fiddly, too many monsters abilities that make you keep reading the cards all the time (although I think this will get more natural as we play more quests).

Still have to play the normal version where one player is the overlord.

Yera

Ademas de las expansiones gordas (y las medianas) tambien tiene adquiridas las expansiones de Lugartenientes (que ni me molesto en poner aqui una por una: son la mini de personaje y un pequeño mazo de cartas para que no te de tanto la impresion de que te estan atracando en toda la cara cobrandote 9 pavos por algo que deberia venir de serie). 

Tambien mencionar las (hasta la fecha, 4) expansiones "cooperativas", que permiten jugar sin "señor supremo", y la app recientemente lanzada (para PC/Steam, iOS y android) que hace ella la funcion de "señor supremo" (todavia no probada)

Es EL dungeon crawler por excelencia en la actualidad. al principio impresiona y nubla un poco al jugador porque hay "muchas cosas que mirar" (sobre todo si juegas directamente al juego expandido). pero al cabo de poco tiempo te mete en la tematica y ya solo quieres matar bichos y cumplir objetivos de la mision. 

jugablemente mejora los defectos mas obvios de la 1º edicion. mejor ajustado en reglas y muy buena escenografia (a pesar del handicap inicial de no incluir ni heroes ni monstruos de la 1º edicion y de la obvia falta de las miniaturas de los lugartenientes). 

Quiza su mayor defecto es que por querer ser muy tematico y al mismo tiempo poco repetitivo a pesar de la repetitividad de sus mecanicas basicas, en ocasiones el juego la lia demasiado con las condiciones especificas de la mision. 

Top 5 y mas alla hasta que otro le destrone en lo suyo, cosa que a dia de hoy veo bastante complicado.

pd. el juego cooperativo da para tocho aparte. valoracion breve: la idea es buena. la ejecucion algo farragosa, pero no regularon bien con la duracion de la partida (o bien yera es un morruo, lo que no es descartable xD)

I must be an idiot for wanting this, based on my dislike of Descent; but if they can condense something Descent-ish into ~2 satisfying hours, I'm in.
[EDIT] First quest was less than an hour, which was very promising. That said, it was less than satisfying. Cautious optimism leads me to be eager to try the second quest.
[EDIT] So, the double-scenario setup is dubious--it seems at first blush that it likely leads to an inconsequential half (either first or second) too much of the time. And I think they did a great job of shortening, but they took too much out. There's not enough progression in a single session (which is to say there's none), and the underlying combat game is basically too trivial and random to be truly engaging. A yeoman's effort, but just falls short.

Joc d'exploració de dungeons semicooperatiu (un jugador fa de DM i la resta de PJs). Molt temàtic, es juga per escenaris, amb una gran varietat de objectius. A més, incorpora regles de campanya molt rejugables (la victoria o la derrota en un escenari afecta al següent).

L'atzar té molta influencia, i hi han alguns escenaris descompensats a favor de un dels dos bàndols, a més que algunes habilitats dels herois son massa desequilibrants. La historia de la campanya no està gaire ben reflexada en el joc, no resulta molt inmersiu.

All in all it is a pretty fun dungeon romp...for the players. I feel that the overlord really gets the short end of the stick with this game.

I will continue to build the library with the expansions in hopes that the overlord gets to be more fun to play. It does look like that is a possibility.

Edit: I'm now in co-op mode with this game. If I can find an Overlord I would love to play again.

RATING: 7
As a big fan of the original Descent, I had the same mix of excitement and trepidation that many others did. In many ways, 2nd Edition ends up feeling sometimes better and sometimes worse than the original.

So what has changed? Gone are the glyphs, removing travel back to town and shopping in the middle of the adventure. Skills and items are much harder to come by. No longer do potions and money make their way into players' inventories throughout the adventure. Line of sight rules have been changed to a far more lenient (and far less intuitive) system. Armor as a statistic is gone, replaced with armor dice that are rolled. The resulting combats are quicker, and have a feel not unlike the dice rolling in Heroscape, with shields that are rolled cancelling out potential wounds. Adventures are split into two parts, with the first part simply giving each side potential bonuses in part two; this can lead to hoarding of cards and items for the much more important second part. The adventures seem well-crafted (though not always balanced, especially for certain monster groups), and offer a more story-driven experience compared to 1st Edition's more combat-driven one. 

When compared to other adventure games such as the D&D board games, Descent: 2nd Edition is a more strategic and exciting experience. But compared to its parent, much of the epic feel and thematic detail is lost. Ultimately, 2nd Edition succeeds at its goal of streamlining and distilling the gameplay of Descent down to its bare bones. The question still remains whether that was ever an admirable goal to begin with.

RATING: 5
I call Descent 2nd ed my "grown-up Heroquest" as it features upgraded gameplay and miniatures from the 80s nostalgia.  However, I can't rate this above a five.  Ultimately the game is too fiddly with bits strewn all over the place, undersized cards, and no great way to keep track of anything.  On top of this it has some holes in the rules that make you scratch your head.  For a game with top-of-the-line and beautiful miniatures its disappointing it is not more approachable. 

A few items that really stick out:

1. Lieutenants, which are so vital to the game, are represented by flat cardboard tokens while the most mundane of monster gets its own figurine.  This seems like a glaring oversight in a box filled with plastic.

2. The line of sight rules are kind of odd and I recommend creating a comfortable house rule that all players are comfortable with.  Don't forget to the get the errata printed out so it's clear on how board corners work!

3. Diagonal movement on a square-based board.  There is nothing like watching miniatures skip across the entire board in a single turn almost completely negating advantage/disadvantage of speed differences.  This is another item recommended to be house ruled for a more logical experience.

The story is pretty standard dungeon RPG.  And it's not a bad game, it just didn't feel like you had any meaningful choices to make.  You just do a battle, move to the next room, rinse and repeat.

Well, in the end it's a pretty thematic co-op with a lot of planning. But i expected somehow more. I used to play Hero Quest when i was a kid, and i wanted this to be more leaning towards adults, but it only seemed being a bit more complex..

I disliked the fuzzy nature of the modules, something would happen wich would influence a future outcome, but you wouldn't know how much or in what way.. so without all the info the heroes sometimes loose just because they deemed an event too important or too unimportant.

________________

Wow do i dislike dungeon crawlers by now, sure you could plan out everybodies move to the very last detail, but man does that feel like work & it's soooo boring.. it's all about maximization.. and no matter what, you're either the meek guy who's (hopefully) politely told what to do, the person who has the best tactical skills who tells others what their best action would be, or the one that knows but keeps his mouth shut & then looses interest after a while..

After playing through an entire campaign, I'm pretty disappointed.

What not to love about this game? Excellent minis, upgrades for your characters, deeply thematic. I' ve only played as overlord, so I was afraid I wasn't going to enjoy it as much, but I was amazed by how good it turned out to be. Only thing wrong with it was that lieutenants were just cardboard tokens and if you want the miniature version, you have to buy them separately for about 9 euros each, and campaign book-expansion like heirs of blood cost around 25 euros, which reminds me of tactics that GamesWorkshop in wargames and EA in  videogames use.

Great dungeon-romping fun.  My only problem is I don't like the asymmetrical Overlord mechanic, but this does make it feel more like an RPG experience.  Lots of cool pieces and the modular dungeons are awesome and practically make your options unlimited.

Update: There's nothing objectively terribly wrong with the game - but it's been replaced by Gloomhaven (and to a much lesser extent, One Deck Dungeon)

Original:
I really wanted to love this game so much, and I do love so many things about this game.  We found the original campaign in the base game very unbalanced and kind of meh.

The app brought co-op play but in the end I think the tactical skirmish aspect isn't for me.

When I want something more epic and am willing to put the time in - Gloomhaven killed Descent for me.  When I want something light and fluffy - One Deck Dungeon fills that space.

RATING: 7.5
When we first picked the game up I really liked it...but the more play through that we do I am getting more and more put off by it.  Perhaps I just don't play this game very well, but so far through the campaign we have just reached act II and I have yet to win any scenario as the hero's.  Most the time I feel like I have no chance at winning.  I do enjoy the mechanics and the character customization though.

Pros: way better than 1st edition, incorporates campaign, lots of roles and characters, lots of replay, co-operative (except GM), good art, quality miniatures
Cons: game are minimum of 2 hours, only supports up to 5 players, not a lot of plot/dialog depth

If Mice and Mystics is too easy, Descent is a real challenge! My boyfriend (Ruben) likes to be the all powerful overlord, so it's fun :) Painting the miniatures has gone slowly (I'm a bit tired of the muted tones), but I think it'll be worth it.

Great dungeon crawl game. Really keen to play solo unsung the iPad app. Disappointed that it appears I can't preselects which monsters the app spawns. I wanted to paint the few monsters I'd use as I went, but the app can surprise me with monster I haven't painted yet. I'll eventually get around to paining all the figures which will make this no longer an issue.

I like the new edition, it streamlines the game a lot and has a built in campaign mode. Now the overlord and the heroes are competing to accomplish separate objectives, rather than having the goal be loot and kills. This makes it more about the Tactical Miniature game, so it feel a little different but it's still a great game.

This is an interesting dungeon crawler campaign game.  The problem though is your enjoyment of the game is going to be strictly controlled by who plays the Overlord.  If you have a weak player it will be boring.  If you have a strong player the game will be annoying as he easily exploits all the loopholes in the game and completely evades the core mechanics of the gaming turning the game into a monotonous tedium of yuk.  Your best bet is to play with a decent gamer as the overlord provided he  thinks theme is the end all be all because that is all you will have.

This is sort of mid-way between an RPG and a boardgame, and it shares too much theme with RPGs. Basically, D&D scratches the "group roleplaying game" itch better, something like Dead of Winter/Arkham Horror does a better job at "long co-op board game", and things like Mice & Mystics/Pathfinder Card Game give me a better "sub-2-hour dungeon-crawl".

Descent is antithetical to what I consider a fun game.  I could care less about my character.  The combat and special abilities and rolling the dice--it all makes me sad I am not playing a game with wooden cubes.  I want to play games where I have really interesting choices to make on my turn.  I crave a crunchy points optimization puzzle.  Descent is a good game made for a different gamer than me.  Certainly, Descent has well illustrated artwork and cool miniatures and lots of well thought out mechanics of how players will do combat with enemies.  Descent is an activity I wish to abstain from and leave it alone for other players to play.

RATING: 8
This game is EXCELLENT in representing tactical fantasy scenarios and requiring teamwork for the heroes and a strategy by the Overlord. The smaller boards make the game much more accessible than the old version. On the other hand, this is NOT a dungeon crawl like the old version, so if you loved that, this is very different.Additionally, some of the levels do not feel well balanced.

Great fun--an adventure system that is surprisingly complete and reasonably complex without going to the depth of a full blown RPG. It's extensible to boot--you can get expansions (soon to be many, many more I'm sure), you can roll your own adventures (now with the Scenario Builder tool on FFG.com it's even easier). Really no complaints with this one, and I'd play it anytime I had the time.

Still crap. Could do a better dungeon crawl with D1E material and different rules in a month or so.. We will see how this "evolves" though.

Pretty good, but still prefer the original edition. I like that the campaign can accommodate 2 or 3 heroes, unlike the first edition campaign. Don't like that the entire scenario is revealed from the start and that it depends on the campaign for character advancement. The print-on-demand expansions play a lot like the first edition (hidden rooms, kill & loot), except fully coop with randomized dungeons, so those PoD expansions are my favorite way to play. The app is good too.

A bit of a mis-step for me. The scenario's seemed off balenced and the mechanics a little flawed. However, every single issue i had with this game was resolved in Imperial Assault. Which feels like Descent 2.5. I can't see myself playing Descent 2 over Imperial Assault.

I've played through a campaign of this (as the Overlord) and a campaign of Star Wars: Imperial Assault (as a hero). Both were lots of fun but had the same problem (for me): As the characters get more and more special abilities, the game becomes more complicated and each quest/mission/battle moves slower than the last. The result is the campaign gets less fun as it goes on. Still, the games are fun -- I think that the campaigns start out as an 8 and end up a 6, thus the 7 rating. I like the fantasy theme better, but I think Star Wars plays a bit quicker.

I loved first edition despite how long and clunky it was.

Second edition retains almost everything I loved about the original while improving it in many ways. This is a fantastic game that makes it to the table much more frequently than its predecessor.

Not every quest is perfectly balanced, but the campaign play overall is outstanding. This game is a blast to play as the heroes or the overlord.

For all the box dungeon crawl games this is the cleanest ruleset I have played and it works well. I think it plays best with three(one overlords two players) cuts down on down time and monsters on the board.

Dice emphasize drama at the expense of skill, strategy, and tactics.

Streamlined rules and enhanced play keeps the score high but the entire game play revolving around a continual campaign drags it down for me.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (February 2013)

I was skeptical of this re implementation, I really liked the original and I was kind of sad that they decided to include much less miniatures and game material in general, however I found this is a very exciting game and I really want to play the campaign.

I cannot properly compare with the first edition because I only played that game once, however this game is right up to my alley. The theme is perfect for me, the miniatures are gorgeous, the components well crafted, the art is sublime and the gameplay is fast and furious. I was surprised we managed to play a map under 2 hours! 

The double-scenario mission is great, I feel the pace of the game is very fast and I love the 2nd part consequences. The campaign seems to be very interesting with both the heroes and the overlord leveling up. I’m impressed with the map and the “adventures” possible while traveling, very neat idea.  I’m looking forward to play it more (as the overlord of course :devil:).

So far my only complaint is the LOS, I haven’t read the rules, but the heroes were able to target me, even though I was completely behind a wall (for all the good it made them :D), I will have to review this but if it turns out to be correct, I dislike this new simplified LOS.  

This is the right amount of RPG I crave and need, I really like RPG games, but they consume so much time that I had to abandon them, but Descent 2nd edition can fill that hole in a reasonable time frame. 

For now I want to continue the campaign soon and I want to buy it. Also I’m interested in learning all the differences from the previous edition. I’m rating it a tentative 7.5 because this is not a game I would want to play every time, but it is close.

Current Rating: 7.5

Sadly my Descent plays have come to a temporal hiatus (I hope). As the overlord, I never lost a mission (except the first one) so my fellow players decided the overlord was overpowered and stopped playing the game. Not sure if this is the case or not, here on the geek I have seen many Overlords crying for help because their heroes counterpart were pounding them. If I want to continue playing Descent, it seems I would have to play as a hero. I like the game so much, than I’m willing to play it no matter what, still I’m downgrading its rating due to the (possible) balance issues.

It’s been a long time since I last played Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition). My desire to do is rather low. I have come to realize I no longer enjoy this kind of game. Due to this I’m downgrading its rating.

First impression from reading the rules and one game session:

While I loved the original Descent, this is better in almost every way.  Most importantly, this will see much more play time as it plays more quickly than the original.  I love that the campaign system is built right in.  Road to Legend made the orignal Descent much better and the system in Descent 2 I think will work well.  About the only thing I don't like are the LOS rules.  I don't see how the new rules are better than "center to center" los.

I appreciate the fact that the upgrade kit will allow the use of the original monsters and heroes.  I wish the tiles were compatible, but I suppose there's nothing stopping you from just using the Descent 1 tiles in home-made or fan-made scenarios.

There's not a ton of weapons/armor/spells/equipment in the base game, but I imagine that this will be rectified throgh expansions.

This has been revitalised with the arrival of the app which allows me to play it co-operatively with my son.  We've had some great sessions and - if FFG offered a full on-line campaign for a reasonable price - I'd jump on it.  Not interested in the first paid expansion as it looks like an "arcade mode" with no narrative.

If you can't afford to touch Hero Quest or the original Warhammer Quest, then this is your next best bet for a good affordable dungeon crawl game. I own the Fantasy Flight second edition, which I hear is a more watered down version of its original, but still lots of replay-ability and with its numerous expansions,its sure to be a favorite for many years to come.

Impression after 2 scenarios: There's a lot to like here. Fantasy themed, scenario based, tactical miniatures game, what's not to like? The bits are beautiful, the gameplay is smooth, it's not very difficult to teach. It turns out, though, that there are some less than fun situations that can crop up. My initial thought is that this is a fun game (maybe the best non-scifi tactical miniatures game), but you'll want to be careful about which characters you include on your team, and which ones you leave on the sidelines.

Descent 2nd edition is an impressive "RPG in a box" system. Mechanics work together fairly well (though not perfectly) and the thematic elements of the game come through brilliantly. Replete with choices and customizable features for endless repeat playability. Lots of work to set up and some minor rules quirks. Great game, but I traded my copy b/c I just don't have the time or group to dedicate to the full campaign framework of the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As a dungeoncrawler for more than 2 people, this is the behemoth of the genre. I love to play this (and get to play it a lot, since most of my friends really wanna join the campaign), but sometimes the balance just seem way off. With a smart group of players, the overlord just has very little chance to succeed. For example, just played the interlude where a dwarf hero had to carry a casket to the exit. He had 19 life and 2 healing potions, that could heal him to full with only one action. Thats a lot of soaking, and offcourse I was never close to winning. And that makes me loose interest a little, as I stop caring for what I'm doing as the overlord. I would rather have a fighting chance, and have only won 1 scenario so far (with 2 being really close though, if only I didn't miss with my zombies in 6 out of 7 attacks on an NPC that one time). The heroes level up pretty fast and gets skills, armor and stuff that they can use every round, where as the overlord is lucky if he gets to see that one card he bought even once per quest. Really wish it was as nailbiting as Claustrophobia every time
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I think the game system is pretty good. At least, it inspires me to write custom quests. However, the quests that come in the box are too swingy. Masquerade Ball, for example, is either a cake-walk for the overlord (if they win the first encounter), or an early victory for the heroes (if the overlord has some bad rolls). This could be fixed with house-rules, but as written it's too luck-dependent.

Most of the quests are just a race, with the heroes and Overlord running to their respective win-conditions. There are rarely interesting decisions to make. Each turn is just move and attack, move and attack, with dice determining the outcome. The line-of-sight rules make tactical positioning near impossible.

The story is thin, and role-playing opportunities are sparse. Quests within an Act can be played in any order, so story-line continuity only happens between acts. I tried hard to find the fun in this, but the system fights against fun, seemingly at every opportunity.

NOTES:

* Hero death is insignificant; they spring back up on the next turn
* Monsters can be wiped out before the Overlord even gets to use them
* Quests are unbalanced - it always feels like one side had no chance to win
* Quests are usually a race between the Heroes and the Overlord
* The Overlord's quest goal is often unrelated to the heroes, so both sides tend to avoid each other
* Reinforcements are predictable (usually one per turn) and weak
* Overlord card effects feel weak and insignificant
* Overlord cards are difficult to remember (there are 15 cards in the deck)
* Quest information is public, encouraging players to game the system instead of role-play
* Monsters completely block hero movement
* Line of sight is convoluted
* Figures can miss an attack (1 in 6 chance), which is anticlimactic
* Movement around corners when a monster is present feels unfair
* Large monster movement ("shrinking") feels silly and unfair
* Fatigue-movement feels unfair
* Heroes choose the quest order, so there's no chance for a linear story progression
* There isn't much story to follow anyway - the flavor text for each quest is sparse
* Travel is unrewarding and nearly flavorless

Check out Star Wars: Imperial Assault. It uses the Descent system but improves on it in almost every way.

RATING: 8.5
Completely different game from the first one. I like the shorter play length, the improved balance between overlord and heroes, the class-specific skills. The campaign mode is also interesting and more practical than RtL. The varying objectives of the quest makes playing the OL more interesting.

What I don't like is the removal of the tactical depth of the game: LOS spawning, guard actions, no skill progression during a quest, little/no equipement loot/shopping during a quest, no waypoint, fog of war.

This feels more like a D&D Ravenloft game where the heroes can play it fairly easily. The advantage is that you can combine Descent 1 and 2 together and benefit from 2 systems using the same assets and play whichever game you want depending on the context. Thus this makes Ravenloft, SDE, and other light dungeon crawlers obsolete for Descent owners.

RATING: 7
Ultimately I think that this game is huge missed opportunity. First edition was a great game with several serious flaws which needed to be house ruled. With that done it was an epic game which captured the theme extremely well. 

Second edition brings a lot of good things to that table in principle, but they gutted the heart out of the game. Heroes don't progress during missions and getting better loot is very hard to manage at all. There are not a lot of interesting decisions, either during the scenario or when choosing class cards. Often the scenarios are lopsided, and the first or second half is meaningless (although I will note that when it is tight it works really well).

After playing this for sometime now I must say that after the revision FFG made with the FAQ a lot of the rules debates were put to silence.  I have no issues with the LOS rules, and enjoy playing this game a lot.  Re-playability and Theme are abounding in this game and the only reason why it's not a perfect 10/10 is that the game didn't come with miniatures for the lieutenants or familiar.  While that doesn't really break the game it did take it down a notch with the value, but overall I'm still quite pleased. :D

I missed the Heroes vs. Overlord confrontation, now every side has a different objective, the most of them don't need to fight each other. (You have to save people, grab crops...) You don't have the feeling you're making something epic.

Maybe too short, some quests are over in just 5-10 turns..., another quests are broken...

By the other hand, the new heroes are OK, and the new powers are nice. You'll earn new powers in time, so the Overlord. The healer is a very good addition to the game.

IMHO, FFG has missed a great opportunity to design an awesome game just fixing the 1st edition.
It's not a dungeon crawler, it's an adventure in a dungeon.

UPDATE: Labyrinth of Ruin is way better. Great scenarios where action involves a lot of confrontation. Seems FFG have found the correct path. Rating raised.

This game has amazing components. At first I shied away from it because I felt the mechanics would work better in a video game, but having my wife play the dungeon master I realized how that role elevates the game to a unique and interesting experience. I personally don't like the dungeon theme (I hate on Diablo, too), so I'm really glad there is a flip side to all the dungeon map tiles. I think it would be neat to see the game include themed maps from more varied environments, and even see those environments impact gameplay.

RATING: 7.5
I really disliked the original Descent. Too long, too many tiny cards with so many card effects -- I felt that the game was trying to be more thematic by constantly adding rule exceptions. 

Doom, on the other hand, (which used a similar system) I did like. It was unbalanced, but had a nice mix of strategy and luck and positioning, yet the rules remained fairly streamlined.

Descent (2nd ed) goes all the way to the other extreme. Its almost ridiculously simple. Lighter scenarios are a plus, super-streamlined rules and ultimately a game that can be played in an hour. However, I did find myself missing the tactical elements (like placement and overwatch) that the other games in the series had. One really good thing about this game is that the OL can pick monsters for a scenario, really nice touch.

A minor inconvenience for me is the different shapes of all the tiles. There are no consistent shapes. Almost every piece is different. This leads to packing disaster  since you can't group tiles by size and is a real pain when trying to sort out the pieces for a game.

On paper this looked like the great dungeon crawler we were looking for.  In practice though we found it to be incredibly swingy and not really worth the amount of effort to play for the amount of fun had.  To be fair though, this is coming from a strictly 2 player perspective before the road to legends aspect was added; we had one person as the mastermind and the other was trying to control 4 heroes so YMMV.

A great system that contains every trope you'd want in a dungeon crawling Ameritrash: dice rolling, treasure, equipment, classes, xp, leveling up, loads of monsters, etc.

There are a couple things that prevent this from being a 9 or a 10. The first is the standard problem with all campaign games: getting the same adults to meet up for the same game. Second is that while every note is touched upon, none of them feel as deeply satisfying as you would like.

With 2nd Edition you are trading the clunkiness and depth of 1st edition for a far more lighter touches and a streamlined experience.

I've only played the 1st ed once and the 2nd ed once in solo to learn the rules.  The 2nd ed appears extremely streamlined and easy to learn.  It almost feels too simple for me though.  I would like to see how it plays in a campaign over time as characters developed and grow.  I doubt that we'll play enough to do that successfully.  The games components are quite nice and the monsters would be a ton of fun to paint (again, no time).  I hope the diversity in monster special powers and abilities will keep this interesting.  I really got the feeling playing the 1st ed that the heroes quest was extremely perilous and they would likely not survive.  That made it tense and exciting.  I'm afraid with the rule changes the 2nd ed will not have that same feel.  Time will tell!

Personally, I feel something is missing with this 2nd edition.
Yes, the rules are a bit clearer, or at the least, less clouded with minuteau.  Yes, the playtime is easier to swallow, for most (at least those that cared).

But, it's missing that EPIC feel that 1st edition had.

I don't like the character class choices.

I don't like the Overlord's card choices or how his/her deck is built and upgraded.  

I don't like the fact that may/most of the quests are races or puzzles to be figured out.

I don't like that you don't get gear in the midst of a quest, but in between them.

I don't like some of the "rewards" you get if your side wins the 1st part of a quest.

I don't like the base game's finale quest.

I don't like 2nd edition all that much, after all...

Hugely disappointing.  This is a general rating after one session (about 9 hours, playing 4 quests in a campaign).  Seems to be a very lackluster sequel to the first.  I'm willing to give this one another try, but if it doesn't impress me the 2nd time around it will be headed out the door.  Easily the most disappointing game I've ever purchased from FFG, probably because my hopes were so high for it.

*Edit* Played several more quests and I am dropping this from a 4 to a 3.  It does not get deeper with more plays, quite the opposite.  The decisions to be made are quite obvious, and more often than not the game comes down to just dumb luck (be it attribute tests, combat, or something quest oriented).

At first, I loved this game. The more I played it, though, the more I realized that it is broken. I think the scenarios are too unbalanced, and the Overlord either has to be a DM (pulling punches for the enjoyment of the PCs) or simply clog passages with monsters to slow the heroes' progress. 

A solid system with bad scenarios.

De kedvünket ez nem szegte el, a karaktereket jobban áttanulmányozva a Shadowrune kampányba belekezdve már mindneki élvezi a játékot, és a balance is megvan a 2 oldal között.

Majd vérpistike módban újrajátszuk a Heirs of Blood kampányt is, de csak ha valami jó kis kiegészítőt is letoltunk már :)

A játék szenzációsan kitalált és a kivitelezése is szép, FFG minőség adott.

Bárcsak többször össze tudnánk ülni a haverokkal játszani.

Must have kategória a téma szerelmeseinek.

Viewed as a simple-ish tactical minis game with a strong narrative, I think this is great.  I never played 1ed, so can't compare.  The components are excellent.  Each player has their own objectives (including the OL), tied to the narrative.  It's worth noting that I can't imagine playing other than in campaign mode.

A great game with amazing components I just wish I had someone to play it with instead of pretending to 'forget' the overlord's cards whilst being the heroes which does take a bit of the enjoyment and surprise out of it.

For a different take on a dungeon crawl this is a nice solo/co-op variant:

This is the ultimate Party VS Master game. It is fucking awesome strategic and heavily difficult for the heroes players. Of course dice rolling may unbalance the battles and tests but knowing that, it forces you to use your brain against challenges and not just hack-n-slash and loot.

More a race than a crawl. The wonkiness of the system and the massive power-up the overlord gets halfway through the campaign killed pretty much everyone's enjoyment of the game. Including said overlord.

Overall an upgrade to first edition. It plays better and drags less.  Quest system is built in and modular, rather than tacked on to the system.  As a modern day Warhammer Quest, all it's missing is a random quest/dungeon generator.  But simple enough to create your own quest paths that I don't really think it's missing anything.  Expansion line looks promising so far.

Take my rating with a grain of salt.  Having played for years(and dearly loved) AD&D 2nd and 3rd edition, playing something like Descent feels waaaayy too light for my taste when I played it.  The no dying part(and how it's actually IN the game mechanic that you have to "die" often to create some kind of scenario difficulty by delaying you for a turn) is also a let down for a RPG die hard like me.  But I can still see the nice game that lies in it.

RATING: 6
This is a very tactical game, more so that the first edition. It means that there's very little room for errors. All the adventurers have to play with the same set of mind or otherwise they will loose for sure. First edition is more of a looting and shooting type of game. The second edition is more trimmed down version, which means that the looting and shooting is basically gone. All that is left are important tactical decisions that have to be made by all of the players as a team. If one teammate takes a different path or chooses differently than the others then it will probably end bad for the whole team. So overall I like the first edition better since it felt more like an adventure/dungeon-crawler game. This one can also be a fun game but you have to understand from the beginning that this is a tactical team-play game.

This version is much superior to the first edition of Descent that it really is another game. While the first one was never accepted in our gaming group the new version is one often played fantasy board game. One big fault: Sometimes you have the feeling, that it does not REALLY matter who wins a scenario because after a long campaign it only matters who wins the last scenario. And the amount of randomness in reaching some of the scenario goals is a pain: For example when you have to find one special counter out of four which are always randomnized again if you look under the wrong one...

A significant upgrade from the previous edition, better level design, less time-consuming, and with a good campaign built into the base game. 

What I have to criticise is that some levels are poorly balanced (up to the point of being de facto unwinnable for one side); also, be sure to read the errata, they *do* fix some balance issues.

A lot of fun as a dungeon crawler.  It was perfect timing for my family over a long weekend and being snowed in with freezing temps.  We played through the whole campaign with my son as the DM and my wife and I the adventurers.  I really liked playing this with 3 players as it didn't feel like a lot of downtime.  I'm not sure how tha would be impacted with a full load of players.  My guess is we made it through our complete run in 17 hours or so.  The adventures have a lot of variety and keep you going.  Though this had been on my radar for years having never owned the first version, I thought it would just be a hack and slash.  To a point it kind of is, but the designers did a great job of mixing up the levels and given them their own personallity.  I won't go into it any further for fear of spoilers, but it was a lot of fun and I plan on buying the expansions and am willing to be the DM for my family next time as I think there is enough variety to keep us entertained.

The second edition of Descent made improvements to quite a few points of its predecessor. What's especially cool about 2nd edition, is that campaign play is integrated into the main box and doesn't come with an expansion. Scenarios are shorter, so a game doesn't take quite as long as it did in the first edition, which is nice. But I really miss the variety that the first edition had to offer when it came to the heroes. Also I dislike that this game feels so much like a race against the clock most of the time. You usually have no time to explore and don't even fight all of the monsters, because just rushing past them often is the better option.

Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) is a board game in which one player takes on the role of the treacherous overlord, and up to four other players take on the roles of courageous heroes. During each game, the heroes embark on quests and venture into dangerous caves, ancient ruins, dark dungeons, and cursed forests to battle monsters, earn riches, and attempt to stop the overlord from carrying out his vile plot.

Descent is not a bad game, some people might argue that the 2nd edition is actually better or not. From what I know,, it plays faster and that is always a bonus for me.

I only played a quick 45 minute game with low level character.

I was not very impressed because I did not have a chance to do much through the game. I played almost 3 rounds and the game was over. 

Maybe if I would have been a higher level character, I would have had more special power cards and that would have given me more strategic decisions to deal with. 

But that was not the case. So this why I might have found my first game pretty dull.

Now the idea is that it's a campaign game and that you should be allowed to do multiple quest and upgrade your character with time.

Maybe the game gets better by doing so but I don't really have a chance to play a campaign game and I don't have the players which are willing to do so. This is why I could be in the wrong target audience and not be that much interested by the game. I would prefer a game playable out of the box.

Still, for somebody that played hero quest, I think this game is still much better because the game master actually have objectives to win, so there is more competition. But they should have allowed player to play in non-campaign mode like they did for Doom by including death match and other modes like the video game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm a huge fan of the original, 1st edition.  This actually feels like a 2nd different game that has been changed significantly from the 1st even though it has some similarities.  

After a few plays, this seems like a disappointment because it does not have nearly the same tension.  As heroes, there isn't the same stress of where monsters can attack from or the mystery.  

If I wanted shorter scenarios (which is not necessarily better given the trade-off), I'd play Road To Legend.

Found this enjoyable and I'm looking forward to continuing the campaign.  Perhaps I should have selected a more exciting character as my bezerker dwarf is fairly simpleminded...:-)  This is your typical team of guys with different skills and abilities take on a DM who tries to stop the good guys from winning.  Having never played the first edition, I cannot compare editions.  Game play is very simple and straightforward - was surprised as I was expecting typical Fantasy Flight fiddliness and chrome.

The board is small compared to the character speed (1st scenario, 1st level)—smaller than Earth Reborn, Heroscape, Claustrophobia. Nothing wrong with that.

The characters have some obvious "style": I had a brute, T was some kind of healer, etc. Their permanent special power, and a one-shot one tended not to stick in my head, though: I did not fully create a picture of the characters based on their stats and their power. That said, there are not so many heroes, and they have only two powers, so things should get clearer quickly. I felt like Magic fed much more my taste for flavor.

Similarly, when the giant threw away a hero, he ended up rolling back in a corner, in a unphysical way. This felt mechanistic.

I did not like the combats so much: I felt a lack of mission (Heroscape, Earth Reborn, or Claustrophobia give me a stronger sense of a mission to accomplish).

I was also slightly bored when waiting for my opponents. However, turns are fast *and* the party takes actions in any order.

The miniatures are impressive (sizes, variety and number). The number of tokens and cards that we did not use is also interesting. I wonder if the cards won't start feeling like Bloodbowl: Team Manager, somewhat samey between games.

I'm ambivalent about this game: more complex scenarios might be good, knowing the rules better might help, and also playing with an English version (we used a Chinese version).

Se convierte de golpe en un clásico y en uno de mis juegos favoritos. 8 personajes de 4 clases distintas con 2 arquetipos cada una, con un total de 16 configuraciones distintas de personajes, buena cantidad y calidad de figuras, piezas de tablero y misiones de juego, con un modo campaña donde se cuenta una historia mientras tanto el grupo de héroes como el lado oscuro representado por el señor supremo se hacen más poderosos al obtener armas objetos y habilidades al conseguir puntos de experiencia y oro al completar los objetivos de las diferentes misiones.
Aunque el efecto azar está muy presente, no es del todo determinista,  ya que habilidades de personaje comando objetos y cartas permiten moldear relativamente las tiradas de dados a los intereses de cada jugador. Pero donde está el factor estratégico más importante radica tanto en saber combinar las diferentes habilidades de los personajes o monstruos como sobretodo la colocación  y movimiento por el tablero de las miniaturas. Una buena estrategia de juego es casi tan importante como el resultado de los dados.
El juego engancha y gusta tanto que casi, casi no importa si ganar o perder, ya que la experiencia de juego es grata por ambas partes.

Nota:

Una estrategia para el Señor Supremo consiste en una vez que "matas" a un héroe, en siguientes turnos no dejar que se recupere demasiado de vitalidad y volver a matarlo, ya que pierde acciones en reanimarse y además por cada vez que un héroe muere el Señor Supremo coge una carta de su mazo de cartas.

A well-executed redesign of the original. Descent 2nd ed is a much tighter, smoother-playing design. I especially like that powers doesn't escalate as quickly as in the original, and missions have other objectives than just killing the monsters/heroes.

The balance possibly favours the heroes to some degree. So far the Overlord has yet to win a single mission (after 5 missions with differing overloard/party combinations), but it has been very close on occasion.

Components are very nice and sturdy, and the miniatures are the well-molded standard from FFG. I still prefer the artwork of the original, though.

The sixty-four-thousand-dollar question: Descent - first or second edition? Although the first edition is fun, the second edition improves this game in many ways: The rules have been purged. You now can explain this game in about 15 minutes. The playing time has roughly been halved. And best: The Overlord now is "allowed" to win a game without destroying the played scenario by a sudden end for all players.
Play the campaign to experience all advantages of this game.

Only ever played with RTL app.  Visceral game with a lot of luck based on dice roll.

A storage solution of some kind is a must for quick set up and tear down.

I can see this can be fun in vs OL mode but getting right group with the willingness to commit time regularly is sadly tricky for me.

The flaw of descent shows for the overlord user. The game is excellent as a hero player.

You get to build up your character from encounter to encounter. It's so much fun. 

But the overlord's upgrade is really not that exciting after 2-3 quests and that is very unfortunate.

I have yet to try the Epic play I think that will mitigate some of the overlord frustration.

Wow. This game is my childhood dreams come true. For me it tells great stories I can participated in. I love the artwork, the components and how the game works in general.
Usually I don't like to play the bad guy, but in this game I love to be the overlord. It is extremely fun to give the heroes a hard time and to see how they master the challenges I confront them with. 
Furthermore the game can be played in a reasonable amount of time, which is a huge plus for me. 
Without further ado: 10 Points!

I really like the pseudo level up mechanic in this game and the buying of items. Unlike for example Mice and Mystics you actually feel like you get stronger over time, although a problem is if your side wins more early on you have a higher chance of winning later.

I also like that while there is a large amount of luck in your dice rolls, it is basically impossible to get one shot, and that even if you die you're not out of the game. The way range works with the dice is also pretty nifty since it makes sense you would have a harder time hitting a farther away target, although LoS can sometimes be unintuitive. Also it feels like tactical positioning of your characters to block off routes or to efficiently stay within range is more important than your actual abilities, and turn order of which hero goes first can really cause AP.

Monsters feel significantly different from one another (even sometimes between the red and white versions of each other), and I like how the initial set up makes it feel impossible for the heroes, but the playing field is actually much more level.

Overall gives the most complete dungeon crawl feel of any game I've played as of writing with each encounter feeling reasonably different despite sometimes devolving into hack and slash which prevent it from having as an epic feel as I had hoped.

EDIT: After finishing the campaign, I don't like how damage seems to scale up much faster than health, which makes being one shot before you can do something useful much more likely, although it is cool to see yourself get new abilities (albeit since you get most of them by the end of the game, I don't know if it would be worthwhile to play the same character with the same class again). I would definitely read the errata before each scenario, as there are some things that are pretty unbalanced otherwise. I don't know if it was just my group, but my playthroughs suffered from huge AP and several of the scenarios being extremely easy for the heroes.

We are playing this game with our group and it is ok, but not something I am really excited about. The mechanics of the game are maybe just not to complex for me, also the randomness is not my thing. And the biggest downside of our play - overlord. He just crashes us like crazy, filling a room with all the monsters on the map, living us no chance of wining. Yes, we won several times but that still felt like a asshole raping.

Type: cooperative dungeon delver with player overlord trying to beat the players; miniature-based.

Best with: 5 (1 vs 4)
weight: medium
Duration: 1-3 hours (plus campaign)
Notes:
combat based on dice rolls
requires one player to handle the monsters and play against the other players; will need prior planning to choose monsters and small card deck
campaign-based with persistant upgrades
new players can plug in and out during the campaign

Similar games in my collection: Level 7 [Omega Protocol] (cooperative, player overlord, tactical combat survival, pretty heavy), The Legend of Drizzt (cooperative, automatic AI, miniatures, dungeon delver, somewhat light)

I found Descent while I was at my local Barnes & Nobles. It seemed interesting and the reviews I found online had nothing but positive things to say. Fast forward 1 year later and I currently own every expansion and monster/hero pack that has come out so far. Descent is a game filled with so much depth that no matter how many times you play, you'll always find a new path to take to reach victory. There are tons of heroes to choose from as well as monsters to help fight against them as you try and stop the heroes from achieving their goal. While playing Descent i've helped introduce many people into the world of tabletop games who've fell in love with the game play and design. No matter how many times I play or who i'm playing with, Descent is by far my favorite board game of all time.

After three plays, game seems favored to the heroes who steamroll through everything you throw at them. Zero tension and no sense of danger at all, while the overlord desperately tries to stop them so he can reach a timer. Should be the heroes who are desperate. Also, less options for the overlord who uses laughable overlord cards and lieutenants.

A dungeon crawl adventure game.  A huge improvement over first edition Descent.  Combat is streamlined and simplified.  Also, you can save the game and only have to do 1 or 2 combats.

Played four scenarios with Road to Legend so far and found it kind of a slog. Felt like the optimal strategy (even on hard) was running our party into the enemy minis and rolling dice until we won.

A very well done and streamlined dungeon crawl experience you can play right out of the box.  Simple rules, fun gameplay, cool figures, dripping with theme.  I want to play it again ASAP.

TRADE UPDATE:  A good game that just doesn't get the time it deserves on the table.  Willing to trade for something worthwhile.  The box has a little wear on the edges but is in good shape.  The insert's been tossed and cards, chits, figures, tiles are stored in plastic containers and baggies. All in good shape.

A very fun, albeit very casual, dungeon-crawler/action miniatures game. 

The components are very high quality, but there are some serious issues with the dice probability in this game. It looks like no one ran the numbers, as there is in my opinion too much variance in an already high variance mechanic (die rolling). The leap in success rates on Hero Attribute checks (hero attribute of 2 has a success rate of ~22%, and goes up to ~52% with an attribute of 3) is indicative of lazy design in my opinion.

Still a very fun game, with a nice campaign system that is conducive to gaming groups of 3-5 players.

This seems a pretty good option for a 1 vs. many dungeon crawler, if for no other reason than you can count on FFG providing plenty of support in the form of expansions. This is more combat-focussed than Mansions of Madness (though I think I prefer that game). My gut feeling is that the small size of scenarios will detract from this game, since although it means shorter play time, there's less of a feeling of exploration (and dungeon crawling).

My real reason for buying/keeping this, is that even though the game is not exactly what I'm looking for in a dungeon crawler, the components (miniatures, board segments) could all be used in another game; I suspect one day I'll want to use a D&D ruleset, and use games such as this one for the pieces.

Of all my games this one has changed my opinion the most.  I loved it at first, then went through a long period of hating it.  Now I love it again.  Why?  It just works for my situation.  I have young boys who love playing it and it always brings them to the table.  

The game is also loaded with quality content.  Every piece of the game is beautiful and there are a ton of expansions.  I own the expansions: LotW,LoR,Trollfens, SoN (expansions), CotF, CoD, ToC, and SotS (hero/monster packs) and they all add to the game.  

This is the game I pull out when I'm not in the mood to put together a true D&D adventure and actually fills a nice niche.  It's easy to inject more theme and RP into the game if you use your imagination.  I also love spending time to paint the excellent miniatures.  

I love that this game really feels like a well-executed and polished experience.  It's the Diablo 3 of board games and scratches an itch that other games can't.

What really made this game special to me, however, was the d6 random dungeon generator variant I came up with that turns the game into a true coop dungeon crawl.

Now that the Road to Legend App has been released, this game gets a slight bump in rating.  The fact that you can now run a full coop campaign OR random dungeon (with the Delve add-on) makes this game a far more complete experience and greatly increases the longevity.

I've played a couple of dungeon crawlers ever since I first laid my hands on HeroQuest and IMO Descent 2nd Edition does quite a good job, but could still be improved.

Gameplay:
+ out of the box campaign
+ character development throughout the entire campaign
+ huge variation of monsters and opponents
+ nice custom dice with an intuitive and fun combat system

- character develpment is superficial
- many scenarios seem unbalanced; in our gaming group the OL wins 70% of the scenarios
- it is supposed to be a competitive game, but since it is very unbalanced, it really is not competitive. therefore it would have been better to make the OL more like a game master in the classical sense, who leads the game rather than being an opponent
- Heroes don't die, they simply stand up over and over again; therefore it is worthless trying to kill them at all
- monster respawn rules are stupid, they simply respawn each round; therefore it is often worthless trying to kill them at all
- quests are often merely a race for the exit, which is not fun at all; we want to kill some monsters (or heroes)


Components:
+ top-notch, high quality components
+ a lot of beautiful and detailed miniatures
+ cool custom dice
+ a lot of map tiles and tokens
+ a lot of cool cards with nice artwork

As usual, production quality of this FFG game is top notch. The changes are welcome as everything comes in a better sized box and the game can be played in less than half the time it took to play the first edition.

======== Skill Floor Level: 4 out of 9
======== Approachability Grade: C

This is essentially Dungeons & Dragons but it's far easier to learn and play and it's almost-entirely combat encounters. Has both standalone "encounter" play and a "campaign" option. An excellent game if you don't want to GM a full-size tabletop RPG but still want to dungeon-crawl.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I give the physical game an 8, only because it's overloard against player and to do a proper campaign I think you really need a couple of other regular players.  You can do 2 players, with the hero player getting 2 heroes and an extra attack action, but it makes the game feel very competitive and feels like the overlord is just griefing you.  Also, the overlord can feel overpowered at times, which can make the game pretty frustrating for 1st time players or players with lower level heroes.

However, it's still a really great, really fun game.  The app component that makes the game co-op however pushes the game over the top.  Playing the Road to Legend co-op app makes for a fun, bonding experience with other players.  Best of all the app is free and you can add whatever physical components you've purchased to the app. so it includes those items, monsters, quests in your adventures.  I give the Road to Legend a solid 9.

RATING: 4
As a fan of the original Descent, one has to be careful not to let too much nostalgia creep into the rating of the new version. And, perhaps even more importantly, differentiate between critiques regarding the basic design premise and critiques regarding how well that premise is fulfilled. Dealing with the first issue, it was clear to me before my first play that the design aim was not just to improve on the old game (which certainly could have used cleaning up after every expansion piled on some new mechanics), but a complete rehaul. Whether this is a good move to attract a broader customer base or a missed opportunity to finally put the finishing touches on a nigh-perfect classic is a matter of taste – I fall into the second camp, so a lot of my impression of the new design may be tainted by a very fundamental disappointment.

Regarding the second point of how well this general approach of simplifying the game was implemented, there are a couple of cuts I have absolutely no qualms with: I did not miss counting threat or conquest, and melee/ranged/magic are still nicely differentiated in spite of restricting the system to a single attack die. Together with the great design of the components, it is actually possible to play this smoothly and without referencing the rules, something that only ever happened with the original game when we managed to play once a week and were well acquainted with the rule details.

What I do miss, however, is the range of tactical options in combat. Throwing out offensive fatigue (for surge dice) and the special orders is a severe restriction of how to approach things. Combined with movement/blocking/line-of-sight rules that boil down to Move Everywhere – Shoot Everything, this makes for considerably more bland combat. This shifts the whole game from being tactics-oriented to scenario-oriented, and probably reduces replayability quite a bit. Furthermore, having to rely more on good scenarios to provide lasting interest pushes the game more into RPG territory.

Which, in and by itself, is not a problem, but it makes those rules that are necessary for game balance, but run against narrative sense, more aggravating than in the original game, which made no great efforts to sell its scenarios as anything more than a flimsy excuse to beat stuff up good. Examples we came across in our first game are the fact that anything you don’t search while in the midst of combating the hordes of evil will vanish in thin air as soon as the scenario goal is fulfilled, and the hope to get knocked out instead of just severely hurt between scenario scenes due to the free heal roll. Small grievances, but they get more aggravating when you consider that, instead of inventing new mistakes, the designers could have put their efforts and creativity into solving the mistakes of the original game ...

To end on a positive note, the campaign system is hugely promising, with a clear narrative arc, good theme and interesting decisions for the group of heroes. If I am ever going to write a proper review, it will be after we’ve played through our first go at it, which I am very much looking forward to.

Update: After having played two thirds of a campaign, I'm more and more convinced that reinvention instead of evolution was the wrong path to take for Descent. In spite of the less challening gameplay, there are at least as many instances as in 1st Edition games where our group had to reread, clear up or plain invent rules to keep the game going. Additionally, stuff like the plain horrible rules for large monster movement implodes any sense of immersion that might have come up, and as a pure tactical exercise, Descent 2ed is simply far too simple.

RATING: 8.5
I'm a sucker for dungeon crawls with grid based tactical combat.  Only downside to these games generally (and Descent is no exception) is the rules are a tad bit more complex and they aren't easy to play regularly.  Yet, I continue to fill my shelves with them.  Likely won't collect everything for Descent since Imperial Assault is an improvement (plus skirmish allows me to get it to the table more).

3.2 - THE dungeon crawler. However, it has been completely usurped by the superior Star Wars: Imperial Assault.

Action Point Allowance System, Dice Rolling, Grid Movement, Hand Management, Modular Board, Partnerships, Variable Player Powers.

Bought from Eclectic Games. To sleeve. Needs a good sort out (expansions back into boxes), and needs painting.

It's an ok game. The big downside is that it's really not ballanced and the overlord, if played well, has the advantage. That makes the game a bit meh when 4 player lose against 1 in 70% of the kampagne. I prefer Galaxy Defenders because you don't need an overlord and hex > square

Number of plays based on the number of quests played.

Rating based only on playing the "First Blood" quest once as the OL. I had a great time. It was very easy to explain the game to my friends and, in 10 minutes, we started playing.

All the group, formed by people who are used to RPGs like D&D 3.5, enjoyed the game and are looking forward to play.

Rating may go up after starting a campaign, what I plan to do soon.

Holy balls what a great game!

We finally got this to the table and played one of the starting scenarios.  About halfway through the game I realized I was playing one of my new favorite games.  Easily in my top 10.

I enjoy the D&D games but Descent does what D&D didn't do and to great effect.  If you haven't played this I suggest, at the very least, that you seek out play through somewhere.

Highly recommended!

I love Dungeon Crawl games. I love miniatures. I love playing the Overlord. This game ticks all of my boxes. And with the Road to Legend app being released in May, 2016 this frees me up to play as one of the heroes too! I find the game immensely enjoyable. But you do need to be in the mood for a bit of hack and slash in close quarters. I have spent a small fortune on all of the expansions, monster and hero collections and lieutenant miniatures. Another quality product from Fantasy Flight Games.

...the 2nd edition rolled around.

After a few plays, I've rapidly fallen in love with this game. It streamlines nearly everything about the 1st edition, is quicker, and is made for campaigns. My son and I love this game, though I've had a hard time getting my regular group to give it a go.

Also, you can play schizophrenically solo pretty easily, as there's really no hidden information other than the Overlord hand, which can be randomized every turn if you wish to keep it surprising (I discard and redraw 3 cards at random from the hand every turn as the OL).

RATING: 8.2
Each quest are normally part of the campaign game (except first blood). So if you want to play just a single quest, the hero MUST have some xps and some golds to spend before the quest to have a fair chance to win it. 

A regular quest with the basic equipment for the hero give the edge to the evil lord (seigneur du mal).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This feels like a more refined Warhammer Quest, which is both a good and a bad thing. It has a bit less character than WHQ, and maybe a bit too much polish, but it plays more smoothly.

On balance, though, I still prefer the D&D Adventure game line, even taking into account their lack of continuity -- continuity being the thing about Descent I found to be the most fun.

Maybe three plays isn't enough to see the best bits, but on the whole this felt solid but a tiny bit bland.

Nice system, streamlined, intuitive.  NOT the LOS rules, they stink.  The quests seem wildly imbalanced and not too much fun.  After numerous plays, we are setting it aside for a long break.  I like it, but the campaign is too short and predictable after a couple of plays.  Initial rating is lower than Descent 1E as I prefer it to this.

After more plays, including expansions, this game is done for me. Just too much luck, not enough interesting decisions, and the balance is still awful. Some encounters are very short and performing the setup and reading all the special rules can end up longer.

Especially when combined with the Conversion Kit, this game has massive amounts of replay value.

A great tactical minis game but with a board, with an easy to learn system and an intuitive progression system wherein one player will play as the antagonist and his minions, while up to four players will take on the roles of intrepid adventurers delving deep into dark and dank dungeons.
I say up to four others, but I would say that it really shouldn't be play with less than that number as that is the game's sweetspot and also where it's at it's most balanced.
It should also be played with the campaign rules, allowing for more character growth and a feeling that comes close to a longrunning RPG campaign.

RATING: 9.5
This game is such good fun to play. I really like that I can play this with my 3, 5 and 8 year old and they all enjoy it. Scenarios being about an hour is great. Set up time is not too taxing. Rules are pretty straight forward and it scales great from a 2 to 5 player game. Being the overlord makes it easier to play with non-gamers. My non-gamer relatives always like to gang up on me, the gamer, to ensure that I lose games that I am teaching them to play. This game actually encourages that course of action, and makes it fun for me to play as the overlord.

Highly recommended.

4 / 5 - Great.

Fun-filled dungeon romping with plenty of excitement, and I love the fact that individual adventures are short enough to make campaign play feasible. But ... but ... it sits on an awkward line between being both relatively light and excessively procedural.

RATING: 8.2
Although similar to Descent 1st Ed. in some senses, it is quite another game that should appeal to different gamers altogether. While 1st Ed. has more of a dungeon crawling adventure appeal, where hidden information is a huge part of the mechanics and of the fun, 2nd Ed. transforms Descent into a fast paced tactical skirmish that sometimes seems like a mix between racing and a puzzle. The mysteries of dungeon exploring is gone as is some of the clunkiness of the rules.

I find both editions to be good games, but personally prefer 1st ed. style.

Feels different enough from the 1st edition to warrant the purchase. It won't replace 1st edition, but fills a different niche as a more mission/story oriented game. It's also much more streamlined and faster than its predecessor so it's playable on evenings, which makes campaign play feasable.

I'm playing the overlord. The first scenario's where a cakewalk for the heroes and I made some stupid mistakes. Since then, I've become a better overlord, but I feel that the lead of the heroes has become to great to overcome. There was exactly one scenario that was really close. In fact, one of the hero players stated out loud that they wouldn't win when an incredible string of X'es on my side managed to ruin it for me again.

Sold for $45 via BGG with Heirs of Blood, Lair of the Wyrm, Conversion Pack, Redjak's RAMV, and Foamcore Insert.

Purchased from Craigslist (incl. Wyrm and Descent 1st Ed conversion)

Great game play and expansions.  It gets even better when Redjak's RAOV makes it full co-op.  His delvendeep also gives a dungeon crawl aspect, while Heirs of Blood provides great story elements.  I just wish there were more dynamic character development.

Update: Redjak's RAMV is much less fiddly and the game actually plays much better with it.

Descent 1.0:
- Long setup time.
- Unnecessarily fiddly.
- Long down time between turns.
- Mindlessly repetitive.
- Incredibly imbalanced (!!!).
- Tedious, boring, monotonous.
- Long take down time.
- "Too much time packed in little fun"
- Might as well play D&D.

Descent 2.0:
- Much shorter setup time.
- Stream-lined rules.
- Very little downtime.
- Not repetitive due to excellent Quest design.
- More balanced.
- Opportunity to plan and strategize.
- In-game timer due to quest and mechanics forces short high-intensity games.
- Still retain RPG elements in between encounters. Isn't it the same as D&D? You level up after encounters?
- Fat juicy theme!
- Flexible game duration.

Updating: 9 to 10. This game is amazing.

This week, Descent 2.0 has officially become my #1 game. Check out my review:

Man, but this game drives me nuts as the OL! There are so many things that I dislike about this game: the dice (those damnable dice!); the way the Heroes get all the good gear and level up while I just get a new card; the way the Heroes seem to power up quicker than I can; the way the Heroes kill all my non-large monsters in one blow... the list is endless.

Yet, I still love it. I don't know why. Maybe when I've finished the campaign I'll have a better idea and I'll come back and update this.

Well, we finished the campaign and ultimately found it to be an unsatisfying experience. Very few of the scenarios were close calls - they all went pretty much the way we expected from the setup each time. The group have no interest in another campaign, so this one's for recycling.

Really nice dungeon crawl feeling game that I really wish I could get played more. At the moment I have a bit too much stuff for it and storage is a bit of a hassle. Perhaps I'll try to muster interest in it again at my group and see if we can get a bit of a flexible campaign going.

RATING: 8
Semble corriger la longueur des parties de la v1 en découpant l'amélioration des perso à travers plusieurs parties courtes (= jeu en campagne). Par contre moins de choix d'action, et simplification du jeu de l'overlord (plus de ressource à gérer).
J'aime bien les scénarios dans l'ensemble car ils proposent des objectifs différents pour les 2 équipes (overlord et héros). Du coup il faut à la fois être "offensif" sur son objectif et "défensif" sur l'objectif adversaire.
Équilibre de l'ensemble assez précaire. Parfois très serré, parfois pas du tout. Dépend pas mal du groupe de héros (nombre et classes).

RATING: 3
This game is not worth the hype it receives.  Actually, it is pretty broken.  Too simple to be tactical with horrible LOS and movement rules.  Often more of a race than an adventure.  Rarely balanced.  In my play session today 3 heroes won the 1st big "interlude" in 1 turn, before the overlord even had a chance to play.  This is not a good game.  At all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.25
A tense and tight game, that involves a party of heros battling against the evil overlord. A fantastic dungeon crawler, which is a game of tactical miniatures rather than a light adventure.  Important to take every advantage against your opponent, and make every move count (as the overlord can draw more power cards each turn).

Lots of rules and very unforgiving for new players, but definitely worth the investment.  The scenarios vary in length, and given how important each move can be, this game does lend itself to analysis paralysis (which can result in a scenario taking 4+ hours).

Overall it is an excellent game and has a great theme.

Important to play close attention to the victory conditions.  Most scenarios are a race to the finish.

RATING: 10
Good: 
The Descent app allows us to play without a GM and handles some of the booking keeping that comes when playing a campaign.  

This game is the dungeon crawl to play when you want to take a party of characters through a campaign, or a series or random dungeons. It is fun selecting a character and building them up in gear and skills to overcome the challenges the app tosses at your party.

This isn't an RPG but it's a nice substitute when you don't have a GM or you have friends over that aren't into RPGs. This is, hand's down, the best co-op dungeon crawl I have found to-date.

Good quality components. 

Setup isn't too bad, the app tells you what to pull out for the scenario, you put your characters on the starting tile, and then you are set to play. 

Scales from 1-4 extremely well.

Bad: 
This game has a lot of components and so it can be a pain to store everything. Additionally, to keep downtime minimal you will likely need to have some sort of organization system to make finding the creatures and tiles easy when the app asks for them. 

Analysis Paralysis when trying to figure out which heroes you would like to play through a campaign with. XD

This system would have been fine, but I was highly disappointed by the line of sight rules and the fact that it is square- rather than hex-based. Square-based games always make measuring distance and estimating line of sight frustrating because of diagonal "hops." Hex-based systems require more creative level-building, but make the game far more realistic and intuitive. I just could not get over this particular bit of laziness. I have played Descent about five times.

Was somewhat excited about this when I first got into it with my buddies. Seemed like a good dungeon crawl / quest game, what with the continuing campaign and the character progression. We pretty quickly got disillusioned though, when it became obvious that it is more of a tactical miniature game than a dungeon crawler. The actual encounters and the overall campaign were interesting, but the grind and nitty-gritty tactics of winning individual encounters were not what we were looking for. We gave up most of the way through the campaign.

Scenarios are not balanced at all. I came in thinking that it would be about strategy primarily for winning scenarios as a player; it isn't. Winning as a player is based entirely on luck in some scenarios. In the campaign mode, advantages won early snowball if the Overlord wins them.

I think that the problem for me is that I hate losing in the way that it has seemed to happen in Descent, where the outcome is a foregone conclusion mid way through the scenario.

This game needs an incompetent Overlord and good players to be balanced.

Fast tactical combat fantasy wargame. Very high component quality with very thick card stocks and beautiful player character sculpts. Modular component allows highly customisable set-ups.

I played this once, and didn't care for it.  I don't like my board games to need a GM.

A lot to like about this game, especially how streamlined it is in this version.  I actually like the line of sight rules as they are EASY (if not entirely thematic). The only real downsides to this game are in that the Overlord character seems to only have to block the heroes and runaway with the objectives.  Our only win of the very first game came down to the very very last dice roll as the Lieutenant stood right outside the entrance of the dungeon, needing one move to get away from us.  It was tense, but memorable.

RATING: 5
Makes for a very fun evening, but I suspect it is best if all players lean more towards the storytelling / RPG side of things, and not lean mean min/maxing types who play it as a pure tactical skirmish game. As the former, it has legs, it provides a cool challenge and laughs and a good time for everyone. As the second, it's just a lot worse than many things out there, it's repetititive, simple and without much depth of strategy.

Still, just immerse yourself a tiny-tad and you'll have a great night - slaying monsters, howling over the untimely death of your friends, laughing manically as you manage that last second long-shot that took you from crushing defeat to equally crushing victory. The rules aren't that hard, a bit fiddly if anything but otherwise easy to grasp. The campaign structure of the game is a genius thing - it really wouldn't have any pull with me without it - it's how you can sit and play it for a whole night, or several nights. A single scenario style game wouldn't be able to offer that unless the Overlord put down a whole lot of effort to make a coherent set of scenarios and balanced them.

I like it. I played Warhammer Quest and HeroQuest as a kid, and this is very much in this vein. A good game!

This game is a blast. We were looking for a good campaign game, and this fits the bill. Only complaint is some of the scenarios are almost impossible for one of the sides to win.

Every play after from number 8 on includes Lair of the Wyrm. All the plays include the conversion kit.

Also have 1 set of extra dice as well!

Plays from 13 on include Labyrinth of Ruin as well

Play 14 added the 6 lieutenants from the Base game and the trollfens and Valyndra as well

Play 19 on added Shadow of Nerekhall

Play 24 on added Manor of Ravens


Also have 1 translucent blue power die from Game Night as well


All heroes laminated


All heroes and monsters painted!

The best RPG/Dungeon Crawl Board Game in my opinion. It surpasses HeroQuest, with its contemporary rules and its fantastic character development since its mechanics are a combination of many other board games' mechanics, such as HeroQuest's and Doom's.

played solo learning the rules not a solo game to much going on.. but it is simple
now played multiplayer.. had 2 players player 2 heros so it was 4 heros vs overlord
good fun, its not a dungeon crawl really. more a mission skirmish kinda feel. nice enougth.. 
still like my D&D system. seems more "fun" but this this good and different
i never played Decent 1 game length put me off
this short game length is good and the gaps between encounters is good in my opinion, balance seems good so far..

Has its quirks (damn you line of sight!), it's close to impossible to find a group that will go through a whole campaign and setup takes ages when you have all the expansions, but I have not stumbled upon anything comparable in terms of immersion.

Serves as a lousy substitute for role playing games, and only works because it takes so little preparation work. If I had more time on my hands I would put it into a "real" RPG, but still an ok game to play for some hours on a sunday afternoon. 
Find the set up to be a hassle tho, and playing as the Overlord really isn´t that much fun.

Nice game in the campaign mode, but it is hard to find a very committed group and a person available to be the "bad guy" (the Overlord) for a very long time.

Man, I really wanted to like this. It is just no fun trying to kill your players in this watered down dungeon crawler. The two mission quests you would think would be interesting, but the first part of each one makes such a little difference in the second one that it just seemed pointless.

I found myself NOT playing my cards as the GM just to give the players a fighting chance.

My original rating was 7ish. I was kind of blah with it after a couple of one-off plays and didn't see why it was rated so highly and everyone was raving. But Descent 2e really began to shine once getting into a full campaign with an overlord and 4 players. Everything seemed just right about it - each encounter was just the right length. With the players and overlord at equal skill levels and rules knowledge almost every encounter has been very closely contested. It is a very satisfying combo of exploration, tactical maneuvering, ingenuity and luck in nice 1-2 hour bite-sized segments. Just recently I've bumped rating to 10 thanks to the hours and hours of fun all 5 of us have had plowing through the SR and LoR campaigns. Excellent game.
2015: Moving rating down to a 9. We have played through 3 campaigns now (shadow rune, Labyrinth and Nerekhall). The game is still fantastic but there are minor issues: lengthy setup, loads of tokens and cards to keep track of, system feels a little clunkier now that Imperial Assault is out.
Mid 2016: Moving rating back to 10 for the excellent Road to Legend app. My Descent group is really loving it.

Nice try, but... This is not a hard rocking dungeon crawl with bashing and smashing any longer, it is just a lame kind of rushing and blocking. It makes no sense for the Overlord to fight the heroes and to kill them, he only has to escape from the dungeons asap or to collect some markers. Boring.

Our campaign has continued to spiral out of control as the heroes romp and the overload has no hope.  It's clearly causing frustration.  Could other modules/campaigns be better?  Do we just need to take it easy on the losing side?  Maybe... but it's soured me on a game I thought I'd like much more.

EDIT: As the campaign dragged on my rating on this dropped further.  It might bounce back with a better campaign or a better group, but there's still fundamental things in the rules I dislike that aren't going to change.

It's what a fantasy adventure game should be. The rules are actually pretty light and the campaign really works well. It's not a super tactical game but it has it's moments. For a light fantasy adventure role play this is the game but for me, Mageknight is more my style.

Absolutely great game.  Fun for experienced gamers who can take the game to another level; playing full campaigns to build epic heroes, while still for casual gamers who like to roll dice for about an hour.

Like all games of this sort the person who plays as the Overlord character will control the mood of the game much more than the others, so it is important to know when to let up on the heroes to let them think they have a bit more of a chance (and more fun) or to really fight hard (even when in non-winning situations).

Overlorded the base-game campaign in Summer 2014 and it was a good time.  This is not a rollicking, freewheeling storytelling-dungeoncrawl game--more of a knife fight in a closet, with the story a bit tacked on.  If that mentality sounds right for your group, Descent's the best all-vs-1 game I've played.

Overall a good, tight, savage (if not particularly innovative) system, with replayability proportionate to personal taste for the material and degree of investment in its expansions.  What I liked most about this, D&D does better.  YMMV.

Must haves: expansion (LoR) and upgrade kit with proxy miniatures. 

Update:
Well, what can I say. I do not like the way the game sets goals for the overlord and the heroes. The last few plays showed that I am urging for more complexity (e.g. D&D4e). There is just little character customization, missing loot-system and somewhat blant attacks.

This is a solid game as it is. The main downside is, that it can be quite unbalanced with certain hero class combinations. Additionally, it is more funs for the heroes in my opinion. 
It becomes even better with the mechanics and additional campaigns introduced in the big box expansions. I recommend to get Shadow of Nerekhall before Labyrinth of Ruins.
It is NOT a dungeon crawler as you might expect. For me it feels very focused on the objective, some call it a "race game" because of this. There is not time to slay the heroes as overlord :-(

RATING: 1
The game is very often won by some combination of rules that makes the scenario a cake walk (for which ever side makes the combo).  There are flat out broken aspects of the game such as: having an Air Elemental bloken a tunnel with a pile of figures behind him; using the "Reinforce" overlord card to plop some minions right on the "i win" space; moving to the luitenant you have to kill on the first turn and immobilizing him (a 90% chance for the dwarf) making it impossible to escape before being killed.  I could go on and on.  No matter how much they FAQ and houserule this game is won't be a game of skill.  It's all dice rolls and random rules creating completely lopsided encounters.

Not a dungeoncrawler, but an epic fantasy adventure/skirmish as close as D&D Rpg you could get... In 60-90 min. Amazing. Exceptional production value, with great expansions (beware: they could turn into a cumbersome [i]thing[/i], keep everything well-organized from the start).
Linked campaigns with paths based on outcomes are just great, as the simple yet addictive gameplay, within reach of anyone.

The only little add-on I may suggest: use the LOS from Imperial Assault (cone of vision instead of single line). 

Also a bit "fiddly" with tons of cards and pieces, and a bit too much "static" with the combat (here I block the path with my giant beast: you're stuck).

Schon die erste Ediion von Descent: Reise ins Dunkel fand ich persönlich großartig. Zugegeben, die einzelnen Szenarien hatten eine abartig lange Spieldauer und das Regelwerk war an vielen Stellen nicht elegant. Mit der 2nd Edition haben Fantasy Flight an den richtigen Stellen nachgebessert. Die Szenarien spielen sich nun viel flotter und bauen aufeinander auf. Viele Regeln wurden verbesser. Das Kräfteverhältnis zwischen Overlord und Helden wurde gebalanced. Für mich ist Descent der beste Dungeon Crawler in Brettspiel-Form und durch das unzählige Zusatzmaterial könnte man wahrscheinlich die restliche Zeit seines Lebens mit Descent füllen ^^

Me encanta este juego! Yo soy un jugador de dungeon crawlers y este juego tiene todo lo necesario realmente, aunque podría decir que es un adventure crawler.
Primero, la mecánica del Overlord, donde hay un humano que puede ir sintiendo como los jugadores van desarrollando sus estrategias para tomar medidas al respecto y aguarles la fiesta :D . 
De ahí el crecimiento de los personajes, con poderes específicos por clase del arquetipo,  poderes que vas comprando al ir avanzando en la aventura. A los ítems que van mejorando y que al haber tantos, al pasar de aventura a aventura, vas a ver nuevos y por supuesto, más poderosos, todos finamente balanceados. 
Los monstruos son increíbles, desde las miniaturas hasta sus propias características hacen del juego algo vistoso y retador de jugar. Hacen que lleguen momentos épicos donde realmente pensar en equipo como derrotarlos es de lo más divertido del juego.
Finalmente, sin ser menos importante, las expansiones, hay tantas! Y con tantas variaciones, los nuevos personajes, clases  y monstruos que realmente vale la pena tenerlas todas.

Descent 2nd Edition is a pretty awful and vastly over hyped reboot. It looks a bit prettier with nicer looking models, but in terms of substance its dumber and shallower, lacking all the charm and charisma of its predecessor.

It might be faster to play, set up and break down again, but its killed all the decision making, fun and depth in the process. I personally never had a problem with Descent 1st being too long. If I actually manage to get a gaming group together then there will usually be a several hour slot for playing a scenario or two anyway! In its defence, Descent 2nd sets up a scenario in about 5-15 minutes and usually plays in about 15-55 minutes.

Its biggest move is from straight dungeon crawling to scenario based missions. It should be more interesting but it actually makes 2nd more prone to balance problems then the original.

It also suffers from the same Hero development overkill problem that 1st Edition does, where by the time the Heroes reach the end of the campaign they are SO strong they can one hit kill almost anything unless they miss. This is even made worse in this version due to huge sets of crazy skill combos making them virtually untouchable, game breaking gods!

As the Overlord they've also rubbed out the dynamic ability to deck build and spend/build threat, leaving you with few effective choices. After a point there is little to spend OL experience on, as only a handful of cards will have a use depending upon your opponents.

I feel overall that those looking for a rich and in depth Dungeon Crawler are best to stick with the original edition.

I plan to take some elements from this version that I actually kind of liked (no special actions, more controlled spawning, no glyphs, recovery rolls) and work them into the old rules, with the aim of clearing up the game play a little (particularly with the aim of making a quicker, playable campaign) but keeping all the juicy complexity that makes Descent 1st what it is.

I thought my stance on this one was around a 6, but after playing through campaigns as both a hero and the overlord and reading the comments I found I'm apparently closer to a 4. I'm going to mark it as such, especially considering all the glory bashing at the other end of the ratings.

Most miserable time playing as an Overlord/Dungeon Master EVER* (*Until I played as Overlord in [i]Imperial Assault[/i] which is the same shit only worse).

This should have been a great evolution, not a poor reinvention.

Also this appears to be the most horrific money grinder ever created- expansions, conversion packs, lieutenant packs, upgraded miniature packs... sometimes FFGs you make me sick.

Progressive Rating: 8-7-6-4.

This is not normally my style of game, but I have to say that I have been in a full-blown fever over this. I have never played RPGs (absolutely no interest) but I recently picked up Rex:Final Days and Mansions of Madness. They are sucking me into the vortex of this more immersive and thematic style of game. I loved them both, and when I saw Descent (revised) and read every possible thing about it, I was helpless to say no.

Oh, and the fact that it was playable in a couple of hours sealed the deal. 

Perilous caves and cursed forests? Cover me, I'm going in...

This game is horrible. This game had no weapons bonus for the off-hand weapon, there was no buying and selling items, no extra skill cards. There were no feat cards, no upgrading your skills and abilities, and no purchasing training. There were no treasure cards, no gold piles, no points awarded for kills. There was no equipping better gear, no way to get better gear, and no added danger that would require you to do so. There was no danger of losing just from running out of conquest tokens. There are so many things missing, that I could go on and on. The map itself was incredibly small. In Descent first edition, the dungeons are huge with lots of room to move. There was no room to maneuver in the second edition, no way to out flank, no opportunities to achieve your objective in any other way than to go straight at it. This game was not tactical at all. Pretty much you just went towards your objective while the OL tried to stop you, or tried to achieve the OL’s own objective first. I cannot believe this is getting such good reviews. All of those reviews were obviously written by people who have never played the first edition, or who had problems understanding it enough to play it correctly. I, for one, regret that I wasted money on Descent second edition. It was an utter disappointment

The first game I have ever rated as a pure 10. 
So why?
The game production quality is top notch, with all the cards being linen based (even the smaller ones), the board tiles have fantastic artwork and are made of thick board and fit together exceptionally well.
The rules are well written and laid out clearly, and we only needed a few checks in our first game. There is a learning curve but if you have played RPGs or the Ravenloft D&D game it is quick to get going.
The quests are extremely well written and there is a lot more to this than just hacking your way through monster after monster. Both the heroes and the overlord need to work out how to position their pieces and make the most of the character skills.
The First Blood intro encounter works well and leads nicely into The Fat Goblin which is so finely balanced that it came down to the very last dice rolls. Splig was 3 spaces away from escape and victory with his path blocked by 2 heroes and another 2 closing rapidly from behind.... Splig only needed one surge to throw one hero out of his way but failed....with only 7 health remaining, the heroes then took him down....! Who could ask for more.... Even as the losing overlord it was a great end to a near perfect night of dungeon delving! And that is why this game is a 10 in my opinion!

I've now played it with the App as the DM and it works soooo well. Just a really fantastic game!

It's all action for the heroes but watching my friend play the overlord he spent a lot of time just sitting around while we decided what to do, how we'd do it and then even executing what we're doing he get's to roll one defence die and that's it.

As a Hero I've enjoyed it but the missions are very random in nature and follow no storyline. My character the warrior seems to be pointless in this edition, killing the bad guy's in most missions is negated by the fact the game is set up to move in a certain way. Either stopping the bad guy's (who move much further than any heroes) from stealing/recovering objectives or trying in vain to stop the bad guy's from quite literally waltzing off the board.

The wizard and healer are immensely weak and the healers healing ability is random and massively under powered. I am hoping that as we progress I can change my opinion of the game.

I also have a professionally printed deck for automated Overlord (Play fully co-op).

I enjoyed the overlord deck, but it was too much maintenance for me. My group has too much variation in attendees to play lengthy campaign games and so I was almost resigned on getting rid of it. Fortunately I finally tried the Road to Legends app and it's rejuvenated the game for me. My wife and I really enjoy of Pathfinder Adventure Card Game campaign and now I don't have to be the antagonist in her adventure but instead a partner, this will be a great game for us to enjoy together.

Once we've played a few more games the rating for this will likely go up!

RATING: 9
In the end, underneath it all, it's "just" a glorified racing game. But boy it sure is FUN, thematic and immersive to play! Streamlined & tactical dungeon fighting, the game is more about slowing the other side down while achieving objectives than killing monsters/heroes per se. Some rule clarifications are a must, it being, after all, a FFG release.

That being said, not very likely to play it much more after the first campaign (a few scenarios left), as other dungeon crawlers (Gloomhaven) take its place...

Only took 5 years, but finally got 1 FULL play in.  I was the Overlord, and was relieved that there was actually some decent decisions to be made (not just roll, move, & attack).  Looking forward to further plays soon!

3 games into a campaign now as the Overlord.  I bumped game from an 8 to a 9 now, I'm just not sure it deserves it.  I have mixed feelings.  Last game had some epic moments, and I won as the Overlord (just barely).  It was one of those RARE games where I was just on fire with my dice rolling, and the heroes were not.  So I'm not sure how much my rating is attributed to my great fortune in winning  rather than this being a well thought out and balanced game.

I have this feeling in the back of my head that I will lose all the rest of the games, just because usually the dice hate me.  Time will tell.

Well, I've won yet another quest.  For me this is a solid VERY good tactical minis game,  As an Overlord, half the game is in planning ahead of time your strategy/tactics and monsters.  I'm pleased the game is NOT a mindless dice fest (although there is plenty of dice chucking).

What a disappointment this turned out to be. It's essentially a miniatures skirmish game that's disguised as a dungeon crawler. I would much rather play Mice and Mystics or the D&D board games for my dungeon crawling fix, especially since there's actually a sense of exploration in those games. Or if I want a quick skirmish game, I'll pull out Battlelore. Descent really only has the campaign aspect going for it, and it isn't even that special.

Regrettably this game doesn't seem to work well for me. The artwork is wonderful, the figures are great, and the equipment design is put together well. However, the game requires lots of down time setting up scenarios and the actual gameplay doesn't seem to flow well. The maps seem a little small. As much as I really want to like it, the game seems like playing D&D with players who never do anything other than move and attack.

Wenn es eine variable Oberwelt wie 'Wege zum Ruhm' aus der ersten Edition hätte, wäre es das perfekte Brett-RPG. Geschichten, Aufgaben, Helden- und Monsterauswahl, taktische Tiefe, Atmosphäre und Optik sind spitze. Die Erweiterungen sind ebenso gut. Besonderes Alleinstellungsmerkmal ist, dass auch der Overlord und seine Schergen eigene Ziele haben. Das gibt es in anderen "Dungeonspielen" meist nicht. Aus diesem Grund finde ich die App auch nur gut und nicht so großartig wie das "normale" Spiel.

I love Descent as a replacement for traditional pen and paper adventures.  It's a lot easier to get right into the business of running a campaign for those of us without a lot of spare time.

I'm a terrible Overlord, but that makes me a GREAT Overlord, because I am most concerned in making sure everyone is having fun, myself included.  If you just try to crush the heroes, you might end up winning, but you  might also end up with nobody to play Descent with.

My only problem: campaign games just don't work all that well with my group.  Our gaming time is somewhat limited, and these types of games just don't make it to the table all that often.  Might have been fired from my collection by a combination of D&D 5e and Arcadia Quest, but I can't bring myself to part with it just yet.

I also own all of the base-game lieutenant packs, as well as the Shadow of Nerekhall, Lair of the Wyrm, Trollfens, and Manor of Ravens expansions.

EDIT: Love Descent, but my group just can't give it the commitment it needs.  I gave it to a friend who can hopefully play it with his sons!

After just two plays of second edition of Descent we feel we can't stand it any more. What started as a riveting dungeon crawl experience in Doom the Board Game has degenerated into an expansion fueled mess, with little focus on the actual exploration, THE BEST ASPECT OF THE GENRE, and instead tried to do several things a little bit lackluster.

What really killed it for us was the way the overlord gets new monsters, and despite the excellent miniatures and components we didn't really get an appreciation for the game's theme. Besides, most of our other co-op experiences seems better by comparison.

Sold my copy. This is a great game and the campaigns are amazing. I love the tiles that change and it has endless expansions. However, it is too easy for the players. The GM for this game has no real chance at winning the game which would make it more fun if they did. The reason I sold this game is that all my game group talked about was playing D&D when playing this game, which made this one obsolete in their eyes. While I loved it, if we get enough people to play this, it ends up being about D&D or playing it, which isn't bad obviously, just makes this game pointless for us. It is not a lot of fun with only 2 players. You really need at least 4 to get the most out of it.

RATING: 6
Very disappointing game really.  It had a lot to build on from the previous edition and makes a great effort to streamline the system, but the campaign suffers from the typical FFG approach to play-testing: either not tested at all, or presumably lots of tester feedback ignored.  It's swingy as hell.  Neat components, great attempt at campaign play (certainly better than the original's non-effort), but radically under-performing.

After dominating as the heroes throughout the campaign the heroes lost the final, rather boring roll-off/battle because we rolled too many misses.  Damp squib of an ending for both sides.

I hope to one day play this again (maybe as the overlord this time) but 20 hours is a lot to put into something as patchy as this.  Maybe the app will save it?

These type of games are just not for me.

I don't like the theme. I don't like the mechanics at all, I don't like silly, boring stories about orcs which invade a lot of games nowadays, and I don't like to have minis in my games. 

I still gave it a chance, since one of my friends bought it recently.

90% of the time, the gameplay felt like randomness that could only be veeeery slightly controlled by decission making. Random enemies spawning and suddenly attacking at me, uncontrolable random stat checks that, of course, I cannot prepare for, random combat outcomes, random events that are not even related to the mission,... I could go on but I think that you see my point.

The other 10% of the game was some silly story about an orc or a Goblin... I can't even remember it. That should give you an idea about how little interest I had in the story that was being told in that particular mission. What I do remember is that enemies keep appearing and dissappearing randomly from every corner of the dungeon. I guess that's a story too.

To make things even worse, the game isn't even easy to play. The rulebook is quite long and there are quite a lot of rule exceptions and small things that you need to be aware of. I don't have any issues with complex rulebooks or heavy games, but the learning effort needs to be rewarded with great gameplay. This game gives me nothing more than dice rolls and bland storytelling.

This game took a long time to get to the table.  I am glad that we waited until after the release of the app as it made for a very straight forward and enjoyable experience.  This game is a nice step upward from HeroQuest from my youth and has variety for days with all of the expansions.  This game did not blow me away, but I definitely enjoyed it and it is to date the frontrunner to be my go to dungeon crawler.

Not the dungeon crawler I was hoping for. The objective based scenarios played out on a small map that is entirely revealed provide no sense of adventure or exploration. Some of the maps are little more than one room. 

On the plus side, it plays fast and set up isn't too bad, but I'd still much rather play Heroquest than race-for-the-crops or whatever goofy objective is involved in Descent. 

What really disappointed me was the lack of casual, one-off adventures, which is the only kind of game I have time to play. Descent 2 is totally geared towards playing the full 20 hour campaign. The encounters provided don't work as self-contained adventures.

A streamlined version of Descent 1st Edition. Quicker, more intense and dynamic. While my players felt compelled to kill everything that moved in 1st Ed, here they can't help but follow the scenario goal and try to minimize combat, which delays their progress, contributing to the Overlord's objectives. It just makes sense, thematically, mechanically and even ethically.

I hear it's faster paced but I also hear part of that is from slicing the scenarios more thin. I'm curious about what the minute to minute body count of monsters in this game is like compared to the first edition because for me, that's the main thing that makes the DnD adventure games more exciting and gripping--more fast-paced tactical action. However, I am excited to try this one out.

UPDATE: Played the intro scenario and definitely like it more than original. Lots of fun and really pops aesthetically. Probably the current king of deep 1vs all fantasy themed dungeon crawls

RATING: 3
One campaign finished (5 players, me Overlord), one midway (2 players, me Heroes).


The campaign left a sour taste in my mouth. I played as the Overlord, and I won most of the games, more often than not [i]with ease[/i]. (Before any one asks: We studied the Quest Guide each session [b]as a group[/b] before playing)

Playing as the Overlord is not very demanding; often [i]I felt like the decisions were very trivial[/i]. Ie. "of course I want the monsters stationed like this to maximize the hinderance of the heroes' movement", "natürlich, that is the way to maximize the number of wounds dealt this round, and has potential for a Total Party Kill", "I should aim to have my entire deck in my hand at the beginning of encounter 2 to really tip the scales in my favor".

One of the heroes became nearly impenetrable tank (Nanok of the Blade, to be exact). This was easy to counter by [i]not hitting him at all[/i], and forcing him to either leave the rest of the party on the ground, or reviving them and not hitting me. At least two of the heroes remained "soft (punching) bags of meat" throughout the campaign.

One player acquired a Rune that had "Surge: Immobalize", and this proved to be one of the [i]biggest threats[/i] to me, since many a time I needed to move fast with a Lietunant.

There's a couple of things that we should've done otherwise to help the heroes:
* At the beginning of the campaign, the heroe's should've built a "team plan": Who's going to play what, and who's going to buy what skills at what moment. (Would this've been as fun as "shopping" your skills after acquiring enough XP?)
* The heroes may have spent too much money in the first act. Really, the price of the items jumps up quite a bit at Act 2, and the monsters grow significanlty at Act 2. This also has to do with the "Team plan": How to spend the money. (No one knew the numbers beforehand)


I will have to try the Epic Play mode, to see this game's mileage as a "single scenario" game.


I thought it would satisfy my dungeon crawl thirst. But [i]this game is no dungeon crawl[/i], it's a tactical level skirmish miniature game, where two teams try to achieve conflicting goals. [b]And that's ok![/b] I can live with that, and it's totally cool. I just find this game a bit [b]too light for what it is[/b].

This game is broken.  All things being equal in terms of skill level of the gamers, the Overlord has no shot.  Monsters unable to attack more than once per turn is BS. That being said, if you pretend that you are just GMing a D&D type adventure and throw some adult beverages into the mix, you have a good time in the offing.

My only down side is that the game needs a certin flow, and due to infrequent plays I feel like I always need to relearn it. If we had a regular group to hammer this through I think it could hit a 9. 




 After one play I found this grossly unbalanced in favor of the Overlord. It may have been the first scenario, but it seemed like there were to many options for the OL to counter anything meaningful they heros could muster. I found it to be very similar to Last night on Earth that offers to many countering cards and not enough tactics. The fighting system also left me wanting more in the tactics department. 

I hope I'm able to increase this rating after additional plays. 


O.K. so I found out we had played it incorrectly and the OL had to much power/control.


A second play went smoother and the game started to come to life. I do think its a little fiddly to learn, but for the most part it had a good naritive. I am concerned with the monsters acting as cordinated sentiant beings specifically relating to the map objectives, but I may look past that.

Only two plays so far with the kids.  They are now bickering about who gets to play the overlord, since they are convinced the overlord has the most fun.

Edit:  Sat on the shelf after finishing the campaign.  Now i'm playing through it using RAOV with my son, and also using RTL.  The pod adventures are also kicking some life back into it.  Hits the table a lot more frequently now.

Descent is better than most tabletop RPGs, yet still not my cup of tea. I'm just not into ongoing scenario games and dungeon crawls are almost always that.

Great components though. Detailed miniatures, simple graphical layout on the cards, nice artwork. The interlocking and interchangeable tiles make for a wide variety of possible setups. It would be nice if the miniatures were painted though, but that would have really brought the price-point up.

I am rating this a 9 for now after playing through the introduction quest.  I am sure I will love this as I loved the first, but the bite sized chunks were a bit weird.  We shall see, I am open to the shortness certainly, but hopefully the 'skirmishes' mesh together well in the end.

Some thoughts on what makes them different.  It seems to me that the quests are broken down to small concise encounters, instead of having 3 or 4 encounters in one quest, you have 1 or 2 in one half of a quest.  I like that the sit down and play amount of time can easily be adjusted, I like the new classes people get to choose from.

I am really excited to get a campaign going.  Will update as we proceed.

RATING: 7
Second edition is more streamlined in many ways, over 1st. The campaign and class system is integrated from the get go and a campaign is much more manageable in length than it was in first edition.

 The OVERLORD in second edition feels really, really boring in comparison to how it played in the first edition.  Maybe the Lieutenant Kits solve that issue ... but you don't get any of those with the basic game. The co-op/solo mini-campaigns are very good, and no one has to be the overlord, but they have to be purchased separately.  There are fan made campaign systems which are free, and are quite good.

So for me, Second Edition is better overall, except as the Overlord I don't enjoy it much.

Due to broken (or maybe just stupid) rules, the game always feels unbalanced, usually in favor of the players.
The real problem, anyway, there's not much in terms of decisions or strategy for either side, and that's where the game quickly loses its appeal.
Sure, it's faster than the previous edition, but that's all at the expense of tactics. It's usually down to rushing for heroes and blocking all the passages for the overlord, and it just sucks.

You can play as overlord or heroe in heroes vs overlord mode.
You can play heroes vs game with Coop Adventures (Forgotten Souls, Nature's Ire and Dark Elements - great experience and i recommend it)
You can play heroes vs game with the Application RTL.
There are tons of heroes and classes, but yes if u want to have a full experience of this game, u have to pay.
With just the base game its for a 7.

Owned this game before the app came out, and I really loved it for the most part. It's tough to find dedicated players but the game is excellent although it does lean a bit in favor of the overlord if not everyone is good at tactics and strategy. I really want to try the game again now that the app came out as I feel this was the edge the game needed to be great!

I call it D&D the board game. Trims the experience down to the essential parts. You have characters, they fight monsters and gain meaningful treasure and skill upgrades over a long campaign. It captures a lot of the good of a D&D campaign but with overall less fuss. I've played the whole campaign book and am happy to do it all over again. And if I get bored with that, there are lots of expansions with new classes and quests.

RATING: 7
They say streamlined..  perhaps so but it lost some of the richness I felt with the first ed.  In fact, I think they made Descent feel more like a cheap board game and less like a good dungeon romp.  I'm all for the long set up time and detailed rules if I can have a rich dungeon to "play" in...  don't dumb down my games FF.

Update 130517
Broke it out with 6 year old for the first time. Played co-op with app with tutorial scenario. Started out really slowly as it's been a while since I last played and have forgotten most of the rules. Think we fudged a few rules too like how his character was miraculously healed of his poisoned status. Nevertheless, we had a blast killing all the bad guys while being on the brink of death. Our favourite part was the purchasing of loot and skills after the quest though. 

One downside is that I felt a bit alpha gamery while playing as I was dictating who should go first and where while he just executed the dice rolls. I think with more plays, he should be able to provide more feedback during the game. Still a 9 for me.

Played first scenario with full complement of heroes and had a blast. Bite sized games takes this classic to a near perfect score for me. Just wondering if it is going to be replayable once the campaign is completed.

Excellent jeu améritrash avec des règles relativement simples. Plein de beau matos dans la boite (à part quelques figurines, en particulier les zombies et les goblins qui penche façon tour de Pise). Dans cette 2nd édition, le côté dungeon crawler a été complétement oublié. Tous les joueurs connaissent les tenants et aboutissants du scénario. Certains reprocheront le côté déséquilibré de certains scénarios mais tout cela se trouve lisser en faisant le mode campagne, qui est LE mode auquel il faut jouer.

I've been mostly trying to wipe the memory of the too-long first version from my mind, but the first two scenarios played here are both of an excellent length, 2 hours or so, and brings me mostly back on board. Linking scenarios into a campaign is an attraction, where the degree of success in one helps define what you take into the next. Combat is still a quick single die roll (tick). There's not that many text effects slowing things down (tick). It's not that much different from Ravenloft et al really, except here the Overlord moves the monsters instead of them being programmed. Which makes life harder, but still has probably a touch too much downtime for the adventurers, as well as providing some odd thematic moments (hang on, the zombies moved, attacked, then moved back?? What kind of pussy zombies do that!?). Allowing the players to decide their turn order is the big win, as that gets the conversation going each turn as to how best to proceed, producing a true co-op feel. Combat rolls are weighted towards success but fail at the key moments, causing drama, not a bad thing. So the conversation is going, there's a story being told, the game flows pretty easily. Obviously it's all pretty random as well, but there are decisions to be made. There wasn't quite enough tension to hold me, so maybe I felt the randomness was a tad overwhelming, but I'd be happy to explore the campaign further to see how far the game takes me.

This version have some good thing that change from original version. This change make game more interest in both side, most fun in overlord. I think original version have some good thing such as same hero may different style in different game, but something that i don't like in original such as overlord play in one way to defeat hero , kill kill and kill them all so story never important. In 2nd edition something new make game fun and something make a single game play feel boring because it fix everything hero not have more choice and play with single style. I think 2nd more fun in campaign play , long game, and story make game more fun and feel deep in game universe , i think expansion make game more different style and more and more fun . Except too much expansion and mini boss T_T.

2 plays to date. Coming to this game from Imperial Assault ive got to say i prefer this one so far. I think its just the Fantasy theme really hits home....Star Wars is ace and all that but Fantasy really fits the dungeon idea.

Doing the campaign with my 10yr old son who seems to be enjoying it and has asked to play again(and again) so its a home run really!

Played two scenarios now and enjoying the campaign. Great fun.

RATING: 7.2
After first try: 

We played the intro scenario and one of the two-part level I scenarios. 

I've played a lot of roleplaying in my youth (mostly AD&D) so I already knew this would appeal to me, but I expected more game and not only "play". 

Even though there was little strategy & tactics involved and mostly move & roll dice I still liked it. You have to see it for what it is. The game has a little more strategy in it and variation than most of the bash-the-zombis that floods the market right now which except for the theme shares a lot with this game, but it's still more an adventure than a game (and more an adventure than the bash-the-zombies games I compare it with).

What makes me like this game appeals to the AD&D-player in me: it's fun to find stuff, buy better weapons and level up. 

My friends have made some modifications to the rules to make the monsters a little weaker and also to make it more strategic with more positioning and moving around insted of static headbanging: monsters have one move and one action each turn. With that the intro scenario was easy but the second part of the next scenario we managed by three very lucky dice rolls in a row with only one health left on the guy we were to save. 

I surely want to get back to this game and continue our campaign.

I loved this game until I played Star Wars: Imperial Assault (SW:IA), which I believe is a polished version of Descent. Please see my review for that game as well.

* For players who are inexperienced to dungeon crawlers, SW:IA might be a little too intimadating and complicated for them at first. Descent is a tad bit simpler if you want to get newbies interested

* Both games contain a ton pieces to organize and setup, SW:IA has more

* Descent instructions are a little bit easier to read and understand the first time

* Artwork on the Heroe and Monster cards are great and easy to read from the other side of the table and upside down; you can not mix up the health/speed as a heart symbol is behind the health amount and a boot is behind the speed amount. In SW:IA, they are just two numbers that look the same and next to each other.

They did a good job with this edition (although I did not play the first edition very often). The game has a similar feel but it has been streamlined. Much easier to play a quick quest without needing multiple hours each time and there are less bits. You can upgrade certain aspects of your character, mostly with equipment and you really need to play several quests to really enjoy it as you progress through the campaign. Although at the end it remains a dungeon crawler with lots of powers and tiny rules to remember at each move. Luckily some missions are only 1.5 hours as 4 hours was way too long.

Update:
This game is awesome.  Even my girl enjoyed playing this.  Strategy or no, it's all about what you make of the game and we had a blast playing the introductory scenario.  We are planning another play soon.

Update: 
Now that I have started a campaign, this has quickly become my favorite game.  Love it!

The only reason this isn't a 10 in my book is because of the counter intuitive LOS rules.  Otherwise, perfect game by which I judge all others.

Rules are fairly well done and relatively simple though there are some confusing sections where the wording was not well thought out. Some interesting tactical decisions to be made but a decent amount of luck as well. Similar to the D&D board games. The campaign mode is pretty cool. Not really my cup of tea, but it's a nice game if you are into this sort of thing. Seems unbalanced in favor of the Overlord. Ultimately, it's just a bunch dice rolling and gets boring. It goes too long for what it is as well.

Well, on it´s own it´s an ok game, but old Descent is so much better. 

They have simplified it too much and the gameplay has less room for an epic struggle till the end of a quest, much is decided by early mistakes. Levels are more of a puzzle to be solved in exact way than a dynamic adventure of mistakes, successes and close calls. Even dying was more dramatic and you got a fresh start after that.

I miss the power dice, orders, town portals, Hero skill choices - which were more interesting and clever and everybody could train any skill, it was just a matter of who´m it benefits more. I also miss how the doors and chests worked with curses and traps.

The level design is not so good either, the objectives start to repeat themselves if you play the whole campaign. Some levels are broken (unwinnable by one side) and some just plain annoying - the one where both sides have to get their stone from the other side and drag it out of their side took forever to play through.

Przygodowa gra, w której jeden z graczy jest panem ciemności a pozostali próbują pokrzyżować jego plany. Gra jet bardzo ładna, odlewy figurek są świetne i bardzo wytrzymałego materiału, natomiast sama rozgrywka nie powala. Przygotowanie poszczególnych scenariuszy jest długie, a sama kampania nudna, brakuje wynikających w niej znaczących skutków kolejnych przygód, czy wynikających po sobie zdarzeń. Po każdym kroku kampanii dowolnie wybieramy swoją kolejną przygodę. Widoczny jest natomiast efekt kuli śneiżej po stronie poszukiwaczy, po paru kolejnych przygodach, które się udały stronie dobra, stają się niemalże niepokonani.

Rozgrywanie pojedynczych przygód też nie powala, bo same przygody jak i cała kampania pozostają bez kontekstu. Wybór ekwipunku jest bardzo znikomy. 

Ogólnie gra wymagałaby dopracowania na poziomie zarówno fabularnym jak i pojedynczych przygód oraz dostępnych zdolności i i ekwipunktu w podstawowej wersji gry.
W kwestii postaci dużo lepiej wyszłoby wydanie 4 dopracowanych z większą ilością możliwości rozwoju niż 8 słabo dopracowanych.

Do gry po 6 rozgrywkach raczej już nie wrócę.

Excellent campaign system. Great co-op vs. overlord experience. Seems well balanced so far. Plays smoothly and quickly while retaining depth of tactics and strategy. Plenty of thematic flavor and fun scenarios. 

While there are a lot of options available to the player which increase as they progress, the game remains fast for what it is. I was shocked that we got through the the first two scenarios of the campaign in just a little over two hours. It sure didn't feel like it though, seemed more epic than that. Very satisfying. Great narrative comes out of this game. 

A whole lot of epic in such a short play time is very impressive. The whole group loved it even more than they thought they would. This version of Descent is going to get played a lot on game night, oh yes indeed!

Another bonus is the game is actually transportable now. Can easily fit into a backpack...that is until the expansions are released.

Edit: ok initial shine has worn off. The game seemed great in the beginning but the flaws are showing up now. Balance seems swingy, especially with the conversion kit heroes and monsters. Insufficient play testing is painfully obvious in some cases. 

If the hero team is set up and planned out well the overlord doesn't have a chance. Players not sufficiently familiar with the games typical tactics requirements will be destroyed by a knowledgeable overlord at first.

Some encounters favor one side or the other. Certain monster combinations are difficult for the heroes to deal with in some encounters.

sometimes a hero can find themselves in a situation where they are being knocked down and revived again repeatedly for the entire encounter making for an unhappy player.

despite these issues the game is still enjoyable. It's just not as awesome as previously thought.

Edit: expansions helped deal with some of the issues this game had. The new Road to Legend app breaths new life into this game and moves the rating up.

I played as the overlord and kept smashing the 4 heroes, then one guy gave up at the half way point of the story and never wanted to play again. The problem with 4 heroes is the number of monsters the overlord gets so I was just able to keep blocking the heroes which would eat up enough turns to get me the win. Considering selling it and replacing it with Level 7 Omega Protocol.

It's an trashy fest of dice chuckin', monster smashing good times. As a one-off game, I'd rate it somewhere on the low side of 7. Lovely components, great theme, but average gameplay.

With the campaign, however, this becomes a solid 8, warts and all. I'm halfway through my first campaign, playing with my kids, and we're all loving it. I want to finish so I can start another with my game group. There is a nice sense of story, and the power up seems especially noticeable for the heroes. Playing overlord is pretty fun though, too.

I got to play this at my local board game meetup today and it was fun. I like both this and the Pathfinder card game. 

Turns can take a bit long since the hero players discusses about what to do but the game is tight. The GM gets in your face right off the bat and there is only around 5 turns or so to do actions. I think this might be the best dungeon crawl board game that I've played.

Typical Fantasy Flight dungeon crawler. Less tedious than Mansions of Madness, but it still takes a bit too long to accomplish seemingly very little.

Individual scenarios seem a bit unbalanced but that evens out if you play in campaign mode. Seems so to me at least.

Update: Having played a few more quests now I really think this is highly overrated and quite terrible.

Thoroughly enjoying this as a RPG "lite" with my 11 year old daughter. Scratches a sweet spot for a great dungeon bash without being so rules heavy that it bogs out. Can even get my decidedly "non-nerdy" wife to join us every so often without it being too painful for her... A total plus in my book! great game.

Heredero de Heroquest, Descent 2.0 es el modelo en el que se miran todos los dungeon crawler, muchos escenarios un buen sistema de campaña, fantásicas miniaturas y jugabilidad y sin que las partidas se alarguen en exceso.

RATING: 7
A dungeon crawl built around tactical combat. Tiles, creatures, and minis are wonderful. I still feel limited to solve everything via combat, compared to D&D. But the app makes it easy to setup and play with a small group or solo. Will continue to play and see if it gets richer with more varied campaigns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.4
Great components but seems a bit too simplified. The expansions might make it meatier. Also the missions don't seem to vary that much. I also feel the overlord has too few cards at his disposal. I prefer Last Night on Earth even if it has less varied overlord units. I think it works better if you play it in campaign mode but you would need a committed, interested group. I am not so fortunate.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A lot better than first edition. Defense dice are a breath of fresh air that takes the focus off of calculating best case worst case rolls and more focus on situational and positional analysis. Overall it feels more like an actual RP-lite experience. Quests are much more digestible in terms of size and length, most of them at least. On the other hand, this copy heavily favors heroes so much that they end up steam rolling most quests and the few they don't leaves them feeling cheated. Maybe it is just my group, but I feel like the game is enjoyable for the DM or the Heroes but never both at the same time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Not remotely as good as the original IMO (the loss of the "monster placement outside of LOS" rules, the town-portals, and the Overlord's point generation based on number of heroes in dungeon, robbed the game of most of its positioning-based tactical depth).  Too many of the 2e campaign missions can be cheesed via simplistic choke point strategies.  Some Overlord missions are trivially easy to win if you just plug a hallway with a fat Ettin or Dragon for long enough.  I love the art and design of the tiles and cards, and I love the "wilderness travel" section and the overall design of the campaign mode, but 2e overall just doesn't thrill the way the original did.  I'm working on developing my own hybrid rules that will allow me to use 1e rules with 2e's gorgeous tiles and boards and campaign module.

OWN...
 - 2nd Edition Base Game
 - All Small + Large Boxed Campaign Expansions
 - All Print-On-Demand Co-Op Expansions
 - All "Hero & Monster Collections"
 - All "Lieutenant Packs"
 - Extra Dice Pack (Power Dice: 2xRed/2xYellow/1xBlue,  Defence Dice: 2xGrey/1xBlack/1xBrown)

----------------------------------------------------
Exactly our type of game, we love it!
But we had various concerns before purchasing...
>>[Our updated notes after playing are in square brackets, for each point]
-----------
- Very long playtime, especially for campaigns
>>[Each quest actually plays plenty quick enough for us, and we can decide whether to do individual quests, or full campaigns. It's easy to separately bag each player's stuff between quests, to resume later. Mini-campaigns in some expansions help here too!]

- Way too many expansions, some of which may be essential, since base game quest/campaign is supposedly not the greatest or most balanced (although the reasonably-priced "Heirs of Blood" campaign book only requires the base game, so is a very good buy)
>>[Well, we liked it enough to buy it all anyway! And I've seen plenty of reports of other people doing similar!]

- Errors/ambiguities in the rules? which still haven't been fixed in current stock?
>>[Most errata have actually been applied to the version of the base game we have, I believe just one card & one place in the rules still needed correcting as of FAQ v1.5. But the expansions were mostly un-erata'd.]

- It's an evolution of the Doom board game, but that didn't really gel with us for some reason (don't entirely remember, but maybe it seemed hard work & fiddly at the time as a 2P, 1 person controlling multiple characters, 1 person having to play the bad guys - Space Hulk was a much simpler proposition along similar lines) 
>>[Maybe it's the fantasy setting, or the more varied abilities etc, but this game has just pulled us in more than Doom The Boardgame ever did. And so far, we've had no issue controlling & keeping track of multiple heroes when playing 2P.] 

- Maybe there'll be a 3rd Edition at some point, which incorporates changes/improvements from Imperial Assault (a more recent Star Wars themed variation of the same game).
>>[I daresay it's highly likely there will be a 3rd Edition, at some point... but that may be a number of years away. And I can only hope there'll be a relatively easy/inexpensive upgrade path, although unlikely. I would be hesitant to get something like the upgrade kit from Descent 1e => 2e, as there were many fixes required to various monsters/heroes as they have been properly re-released in 2e Hero & Monster collections. We have plenty of game with all the 2e expansions that we'll probably never need to bother with a 3rd Edition anyway!]

- We already own Gears of War + Space Hulk which are better suited to our available gaming time/sessions, yet still have elements of the tactical battles featured in Descent. And we also own Runebound + many other questing games which incorporate the fantasy elements. We just don't have anything which marries the two.
>>[Am glad we opted to get Descent, as it is plenty different enough to anything else we own, and our concerns over play times were unfounded. It's easy to break a campaign into shorter sessions.]

- Hoping that "Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game" manages to incorporate enough of the elements we'd like from Descent (character/ability development, combat, multi-quest campaign), though presumably that would lack the tactical movement etc. And WHQ:TACG also seems to have a similar action system to Space Hulk Death Angel, which we also like. It is also likely to be much cheaper, even if multiple expansions eventually release.
>>[We also now have WHQ:TACG" anyway - more choice to suit our mood!]

RATING: 7
I bought this game as I like the 'one v the rest' arrangement. I introduced it to my group and we played (as I recall) the first two scenarios of the campaign with me taking the role of Overlord i.e. the 'one'. It seemed to go quite well although it's doubtful that we'll continue that campaign as: a) it's unlikely that the same players will be together and all want to play it; b) nobody was gripped enough by it to want to wade through the whole campaign; c) there are too many other games to play!

I'm intrigued by a variant on BGG which 'automates' the overlord so that the game can be played co-operatively or solo. I've also since bought the Nature's Ire and Forgotten Souls expansions which dispense with the Overlord and allow solo and co-op play.  I've played Nature's Ire solo and enjoyed it, but it lacked something and I do want to experience the progression of the campaign of the base game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Better the the first edition in many ways.  I'v played both sides a few times now.  The scenarios seam a but silly and there is so much variability in the dice that is can be irritating. For example I did really well on part 1 of the goblin quest(as overlord) but i missed so many torture rolls on part 2 that the bonus I got for winning the first part was irrelevant.  (I got the correct guy with 3 archers left to me, granted we messed up the doors and my spiders got AoE'd but I was still a good 6 rounds from the exist just sprinting not to mention getting hammered on by the hero's the entire way... this for winning the first encounter.)

I inevitably have to compare this Earth Reborn, witch seams a lot less asinine in many ways.  In that game you can loose a character in one hit due to bad dice rolls.  Further more the movement and line of sight mechanics are a hell of a lot less retarded, yes they may leave no room for questions, but they are just stupid, you cant take cover, retreat, or even get out of line of sight because only a corner has to touch and diagonals count. Also taking damage/dyeing in that game actually matters where as in decent you simply lose 1 action and the overload gets one more card, witch is just another card to do a bit more damage and drag the game on a bit longer.  If for example when you died it advanced the plot like in the first addition then players would actually about dying.  As it is it is just a "grab all the treasure" exercise.

Good for kids to learn running RPG director role.  However, seriously speaking, the combat logic is far too simple, and sometimes doesn't make common sense and the probability outcome is quite out of control; given the same starting conditions, you can win heroically or lose very badly.

[b]Comment:[/b]  It's a fun pseudo-RPG/Adventure game, where players compete against the GM player to try to complete a scenario goal first. This game has a lot of cool looking minis, and I enjoy the way players increase in skills and powers as they invest experience points into their various skill trees.

Frequently base game quests are hard to understand the rules to, leading to game play effecting mistakes being made. This has improved over time, in particular the [thing=137842][/thing] quests seemed very well thought out. 

Frustrating that there are minis included for characters, for monster groups, but not for bosses. Boss monster minis are sold separately. 

I also wish the heroes could invest points into multiple professions. There's so much content in this game, it feels a little overwhelming that you can play the same class and have a near infinite character/skilltree combinations to pick from.

There is the [thing=104163][/thing] which gives you tons of new toys to use with this game. The results are mixed in terms of balance, and this has now become of questionable value as they are re-releasing these guys in small numbers through separate expansion packs.

I like the combination of elements here. This is making me want to get rid of some of my other adventure/RPG hybrid style games. I like the two part scenarios and the overall structure of the campaign. The balance between RPG and board game mechanics works for me, better than some other similar attempts. I've tried several games in this genre and I'm happiest with this one.

RATING: 5
Having played it some more I don't think I'm the target audience for this game. I really like RPGs but IMO dungeon crawls are the least interesting parts of playing D&D-esque games. Old school dungeon crawls tend to lack a lot of dramatic tension that carries the drier game mechanics in mainstream RPGs. Descent is too bogged down in the mechanical parts of dungeon crawling and loses a lot of the flavor that makes them fun. I can appreciate what it's trying to do but I don't think it's for me and my group.

Fun and engaging even with its setup/clean-up time, and the occasional drag of checking forums for doubts. Lots of colorful cards and bits, and lots more available through the pile of expansions Fantasy Flight puts out for it to keep everyone giddy. If you like the game you'll probably end up picking some. If you don't think the overlord player wont be overwhelmed by a little bit of extra rules, I recommend getting one Lieutenant Pack, as the included plot decks add a nice layer for decision making. There are 16 available for now, and I'd recommend one of the following: Bol'Goreth, Merick Farrow, Ariad, Tristayne Olliven, Splig, Verminous.

A game to play with fellow board game or video game geeks, and not with the family on Thanksgiving. It requires a steady group to play the campaign mode, which utilizes the fun part of XP and purchasing weapons with gold. Look for the How to Play video series on YTube, it helps.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Each edition of Descent seems to want to recreate a role-playing game on a board, which I do not think it does well.  Having played through roughly 10 hours of this edition, it is definitely more of a tactical experience, and less of a role-playing experience.  I really wish it wouldn't bill itself as an adventure game, as there is little to no exploration, one must compact their turn into precise moves bent on achieving a certain objective, anything short of this typically ends with failure on the part of the "adventurers."

As a tactical experience, I give this game a high rating, but it combines with a low rating at failing to follow in the wake of the great adventure/role-playing board games such as Magic Realm, Hero/Warhammer Quest, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

The lack of a Sauron-like ruling villain also makes the Overlord role a bit disjointed as this single player takes on the random groups of antagonists time and again.

RATING: N/A
I thought this was a great buy at first as I bought it at the beginning of a game session and we marveled over the components as two of our friends went through the rulebook. It was super fun, and we all vowed to play it again. When I played it again with another group, this game felt really flat as the people I played with did not really enjoy the theme and the mechanics. I started second guessing the game until very recently when I played with a new group and had a blast. Also, the campaign mechanic was used, making the experience much more thematic and "epic" feeling. This game really boils down to the right group (as with most games I feel). Setup time is not bad at all if you have everything organized. And yes, I play keeper.

(Carles) -> Descent es un joc de el guardian VS tots els altres en cooperacio. Com el mansiones. Es lo tipic, els aventurers han de netejar la dungeon de clichés tolkians. A mi magrada aket rollo :)

(Xavi) -> Jo et recomanaria pillar les expansions del primer (sobretot el Road to Legend) i deixar aquest per quan haguem trinxat la primera edició.

This game will be tough to work into my rotation due to anti-fantasy bias in my opponents, but the first couple of games were good. There is a lot of theme. The rules are not a burden. One knock would be some scenarios seem better balanced than others. More pieces than I am accustomed to for dungeon-bash themed miniature skirmishes.

Improves a great number of things from 1st edition. Setup and play time has been shortened to a tolerable amount and the new heroes/abilities are pretty great. There has also been an increase in the quality of the components, especially noticeable in the plastic miniatures.

I liked 1st edition Descent, but 2nd ed has turned it into a game I can play any day instead of a game I have to save for special occasions (thus never playing at all!). Highly recommended.

It doesn't see the table nearly as much as I'd like, but that's probably because I want to play it every day. It hits everything I love about a game; it's a dungeon crawler, it is loaded with plastic minis, the components are beautiful and it's just a really fun game to play.

Good, but designed for campaign style play, whereby scenarios are a means of the DM simply trying to delay the players.

This is a great campaign-based game. In my limited experience the quests seem pretty well balanced as long as the heroes play very efficiently - there is definitely an edge in favor of the overlord.  I believe this game rests on the shoulders of the overlord for this reason.  As the overlord I play with the hope that the heroes win, but I do my best to make sure it comes down to the last turn.

Some overlords will probably play very competitively and I believe it's possible for the overlord to demoralize the heroes too much.  The fun of this game rests in the overlord's ability to balance the game towards fun.

Recently I've found that the game seems so overwhelmingly in favor of the overlord (me) and I simply can't do anything to give the heroes a chance.  We are still enjoying the game, but I think the campaign mode of this game may have a problem with a "run away leader" problem for the overlord.  I won act I and moving into act II seems impossible for the heroes right now.

I literally have half of my monsters just running in circles and still destroy the heroes.  The heroes playing the campaign with me are made up with several casual gamers so I don't expect them to min-max their heroes.  Because of this I feel obligated, as the overlord, to adjust the difficulty to account for this.  At this point, however, I almost can't lose unless I just have my monsters open all the doors and just run into the corner.

Overall, this is probably the best of a large number of conventional fantasy dungeon-crawling games.

A lot of its modern streamlining is appreciated (especially the clever, quick combat dice system) - but it is still trapped within that tired 1980s-style 'move and hit things with your axe' format. So it's quite shallow stuff.

I'm always amazed at how long each turn takes. I never feel like I've done much after 2 hours of play. The decisions that you have to make are relatively routine but still take a while to discuss - a bit like choosing what colour to paint your living room - so I do notice some players getting bored/distracted until its their turn.

You also get bogged-down in having to check rules on cards etc quite regularly, although that's much quicker than in games like Merchants & Marauders, Dead of Winter, Twilight Imperium or Eldritch Horror (all of which I think are too sluggish and fiddly to deserve their high ratings).

(As an aside - I've played Descent's reimagined incarnation, Imperial Assault, once. That seemed minimally different to Descent 2 and I think I might actually prefer Descent 2's way of handling player turn order ... although some Imperial Assault tweaks seemed useful.)

Pros:
-Great dungeon crawl with combat, abilities, and skill checks
-2nd Edition streamlined and polished
-Fun campaign with story elements along way
-No turn order allows for freedom of strategy within complimenting team of heroes

Cons:
-Sometimes rules more fiddly than needed, when a simpler system may have been used to the same effect (see: obscure movement rules)
-No turn order could allow for Alpha gamer to thrive

The best dungeon crawl I've played to date as it is as entertaining for the overload as it is for the heroes.  The rules are intuitive and make sense.  Each quests doesn't feel like a monster smash down, rather they each have unique goals for not only the heroes but the overlord too.  Additionally, this edition has a campaign mode where characters upgrade and buy equipment also the overload player get improvements.  Just a fun thematic experience all around.

If you don't have the chance to play the campaign very often then don't buy this game.

I think the game leans towards action optimization rather thematic dungeon crawl experience. There should be some loot rules for killing monsters, right now the monsters are just a nuisance that slow down the heroes' advance. The game in a nutshell: You need to run from point A to point B with least possible actions used. There are many things to like in this game but you get a richer thematic experience in a shorter time frame with some other games, for example D&D-boardgame system(CR, WoA and LoD).

Descent 2 is not exactly a dungeon crawler.
It rather is a tactical fantasy game, set within an "dungeon crawler" environement.
About all map and monsters data are known from the beginning.
But the game is lighter than the first edition, faster and really fun to play.
One can easily introduce newbies to the system.
Of course, some people have complaints about some simplified game abstractions and about the fact that killing monsters and hoarding treasure is not the first aim of the quests - which offer diversified and, let's say it, much more intelligent objectives.
The mix between tactics and fantasy theme (the game is immersive) is what I really had been waiting for quite a long time.
This is my best game acquisition in 2012 !

I love this game. Mostly, because of the memories my son and I are making playing it. He's only five right now but gets it and LOVES playing. We rarely play a whole scenario so usually it's just 15 minute setup and 30 minute play. The setup for him is just as fun.

On its own the game is tremendous. I appreciate the conservative artwork, great components, creative and balanced play, variable characters and fun scenarios. It has replaced both Defenders of the Realm and Earth Reborn in our play rotation. It's also seems more accessible than similar type games. Kudos.

Rules, rules, rules.  There are a lot of them and it can take some time to get used to them.  Unfortunately, FFG hasn't released any word on some of their more vaguely worded rules either so it feels like everyone is playing it wrong at times.  I love everything about this game, but the badly worded rules are what hold it back.  I'm eager to see how much better of a game this will be after a proper FAQ and expansions are released.  I will certainly change my rating if it turns out as good as I hope.

RATING: 6
Would prefer that this game involve more tactical considerations aside from what ability to use and when.

As it is, facing and positioning matter very little. Regardless of which direction it is pointing, a character can attack any other model within its range. Nor are characters granted penalties/bonuses for their orientation relative to other models. So an Overlord's best strategy seems to be clogging choke points, such as turning 2x1 models sideways to block hallways.

The game would benefit greatly with the addition of backstabs and flanking.

Though I've only played once, so take my observations with a grain of salt.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The only HUGE flaw it has is that, depending on the quest, with a single bad dice throw the game ends. This is very frustrating since any strategy you use makes little to no difference, it's just a challenge on who fails last. That's a pity because everything else is great.

PROs: Quick plays, good components, the target of the game isn`t just "kill the big final boss", IMHO it seems it's a game with a lot of possibilities as a customizable game (I liked the hero selection system). 

CONs: One doesn`t feel like playing a "dungeoncrawl", some people might find it childish, less options than in 1st edition (less actions, less heroes), no miniatures for the "lieutenants" (are you kidding?), it`s very expensive (around 80€ in Spain).

This is a good game. I'll give it that much. I've never been a real Dungeons and Dragons fan mainly because of the time investment and the boring beginning levels, but I have to say that Descent is really streamlined and well designed.
When I first played, I really thought the Overlord was imbalanced simply because he/she could make a million more decisions than me. As a normal hero, with a specific class and thus having a specific role to play, I felt my turns were really thoughtless. Move here, attack here, and that's it. I think as I grow my character that'll change, but the time investment is really too much for someone like me who's used to MTG - where the boring turns only last for like 5 minutes before stuff is blowing up everywhere.

14-04-2014. I do like Descent 2.0. I currently own all lieutenants for the basegame, the basegame itself and the first expansion. I also pre-ordered the coop kit, since it seems extremely cool.

The biggest downside of Descent 2.0 compared to 1.0, is the streamlining. Yes, they stream-lined much and much is indeed for the better! It plays quickly, the scenario's are really different. The artwork of Descent 2.0 is gorgeous, the mini's way better than 1.0. They've done away with random skills. The overlord lost his ability to spawn new creatures..

Problem I have with 2.0 compared to 1.0, is that the games overall feel WAY less epic, but more like a puzzle. Descent 1.0 is epic, long and involved. Because the OL can spawn, you cannot figure it out. Yes, it's difficult to get a group for 1.0. But if you have the group for it, I'd much rather play 1.0 than 2.0. 

01-10-2013. I love this stuff. I like playing overlord, killing my opponents.

GOOD game. Definitely an improvement over the expansion-heavy ruleset of 1e. The Quests are also much more imaginative. If you like 1e, there's no need to change. But if you missed 1e or couldn't get it to the table, go 2e!

*****

It's *really* replayable.

The OL gets to choose which monsters to play in a quest, and each monster group has its strengths and weaknesses. These strengths and weaknesses aer dependent on the quest and the player's heroes. Furthermore, the OL can customize his deck differently. So, from a tactical miniatures viewpoint, the OL should have enough variety. Likewise, the players have eight classes to choose from, and will choose different skills within a class.

You can also play D2E as a conventional roleplaying. D2E now has Willpower, Might, Knowledge, and Perception skill checks, which are skills often used in fantasy RPGs. After playing the quests, an OL should have enough familiarity to design his own adventures!

This is a very cool one-vs.-many experience, meant to be played over a long campaign of multiple sessions (which can be an issue if you aren't getting together and playing it regularly).  It has great components, from the map tiles to the awesome miniatures, and the cards and character development are pretty neat.  I think that the Heroes' character development is not as interesting as the Overlord's, and so too the gameplay, but this can be resolved by having the Hero players each control multiple characters.  I also feel that there are some balance issues depending on player count.

Overall, I am glad to own the game, but don't see that it will get a huge amount of play, and sadly I am not always enthusiastic about playing it if I am not the Overlord and/or the player count is not optimal.

It's got pretty much everything I like in a game: theme, miniatures, dice, cooperative play; however, for some reason I'm not as enthralled with this as much as I was with the D&D Adventure games, but it's only been two quests, so I'll re-evaluate in a while.

Streamlined (in a good way) compared with 1st Edition. Mechanics seems to have been inspired by Mansions of Madness, which itself borrowed mechanics from 1st. Fast to play and much more varied than 1st thanks to differing scenario designs. No more exhaustion plays. Playing as the Overlord is slightly more fun than in 1st, but still way more boring than playing a Hero. The new campaign mode is brilliant.

All in all, a step up.

RATING: 5
So far it seems this game has great potential, but... each game seems to drag on. More often than not, one can see the results of a scenario coming far in advance, and the players are simply acting out a slow loss or win. The role of the Overlord has a fun "take that" aspect, but it's very lonely work, and the constant stress and attention required to every hero's move is taxing. I'm hoping more plays open the game up a bit more to me.

Much simplified from 1st edition.  Still hard to get on the table unless you have the right group (I don't).

My big complaint on this one is 2-fold:
1. It feels much more like a combination of a tactical combat game and a race game than a dungeon crawl. How can I (as the overlord) position my dudes to slow them down?  Not because of some theme, but because I want a benefit in round two...meh.
2. For as simple as FFG made this edition, it still has a lot of fiddly stuff going on.  I tried to make a cheat sheet for my friends who didn't play as often as I do and it was still a piece of paper front and back.  I guess if you play an entire campaign with the same group, that isn't an issue.

I'd still play a campaign if someone offered, but it wasn't something I needed to own myself.  I think I'd have proffered the based game as a pure co-op.  For asymmetric combat, I'll play something else instead.

I own D1e but still haven't played it - traded it a while ago but had limited interest off other players to try it. Playing 2e has rekindled my interest in trying out 1st. 

Things I like - the sculpts are vastly superior on the minis and the scales seem in better proportion - too many ginormous models in 1e for my taste. Art again is a vast improvement - the character art in particular. Also, general aesthetics, layout, etc are all several notches up. And minimal need to refer to rules is commnedable. Play itself: So as stated, I haven't experienced the notorious 5 hour drudgery of 1e's kill cycle, although I suspect I would get a kick out of it. 

The colour to the scenarios is a lot of fun, but I wonder if they have much replayability. Most are over very quickly, and tend to have odds stacked to one side or the other, with this being offset by only minimal impact of winning or losing. Bizarrely the most significant encounters can be the random road encounters (my crew took a bigger haul of items from one of these cards than across two scenarios). But I do like the pace of progression - which is to say tantalisingly slow. It's the progression experience of an RPG campaign condensed across a couple of weeks rather than a couple of years or (in D1e's case) a couple of hours. Playing the OL seems inherently less interesting, with fewer choices and decisions than 1e gave. 

On the whole, 2e seems to be a really good intro to 1e - but until I actually experience 1e for myself I should avoid drawing conclusions from my experience so far. Enjoyed it a lot, but it leaves me wanting more. Will my 1st edition plus the cards from the expansions (thanks to the secondary market caused by 2e on 1e cannibalization) and Road to Legend satisfy that craving? Time will tell...

Great fantasy dungeon crawler. Tends to be a little unbalanced and favor the overlord which can be a little bumper. Also, tis makes it quite hard for the overlord player to provide a challenge but one the adventurers can actually solve so that everyone has fun and enjoys the game.

I love dungeon crawlers. This was a pretty good game the few times I played with an Overlord and full group of adventurers. Having an Overlord manage the game makes me wonder why we just weren't roleplaying. Now that I have played with the app, taking the role of the Overlord and inventory manager, the game is worth playing so much more. I immediately wanted more monsters to fight. The app is worth bumping my rating by a point.

Dungeon crawling at it's absolute finest. Campaigning in this game is addictive and fun. Your characters level up with skills and equipment making them #beastmode.

The only detractor is the time it takes to play, it's tough to get a campaign completed due to time people's real life schedules but so worth it.

One of my favourite board games of all time. Few other games in my collection have had the staying power of Descent. I still want to play it just as much as I did when I bought it on the day it was released. It's that good.

It's the game I was waiting for to scratch my dungeon crawler itch, which I've had ever since I was a kid playing HeroQuest. It is so much fun and it plays relatively quickly. There is so much awesome stuff in the box and the Quest Guide is huge. The minis are AMAZING. You can't go wrong with this game.

As much as I try to like the game, I can't deny it's not working out to well. The game is completely off balance with less than three heroes, scenarios are wildly unbalanced and much too contrived anyway.

Maybe I'll revisit the game once again and change my mind, but so far the game is a disappointment for my group made mostly of 1st edition fans, just like was Mansions of Mansions for roughly same reasons.

I like the new streamlined system and the new easier to use components. But FFG completely dropped the ball on the scenarios and balance, as usual. Maybe the game if storytelling and playing it nice is your thing, but as tactics and ruthless fighting go, it's a no-no.

The ultimate tactical fantasy board game. It's got plot, character development, skills, items, monsters, treasures, and an awesome campaign.

Deceivingly simple. It's not even easy to learn. There's a lot of subtleties and game mechanisms that needs to be leveraged by players in order to be competitive.

Not a dungeon crawler due to lack of exploration, and character growth in a single game (both skills and treasures).

Finished a campaign (9 games) in under a week. Awesome game.

RATING: 1
Basically - take Mansions of Madness then remove everything that makes it fun (narrative, plot, atmosphere) and you have Descent 2.0. At least to me the mechanical side of it felt quite similar. Only it's possible to die in MoM but not in battle oriented Descent (Huh? What?). So basically it's just some dudes in the corridors doing the fighting, and there's a thing about the game which Matt Thrower's comment is dead on about:[i]"sits on an awkward line between being both relatively light and excessively procedural"[/i]. It tries to be light, but full of stuff (the amount of plastic in the box is staggering). Though the narrative is close to zero. Pure hack and slash. Because of unjustified complexity and unpainted minis I'd much rather play Claustrophobia for a light combat oriented dungeoncrawler (also looks better). But if you're addicted to plastic, look no further. 

Rating down to 1.0 because: uninspired mesh made to sell plastic. No atmosphere, seethrough theme.

I may be biased considering how much money I spent on this game, but in general I think it's an extremely enjoyable dungeon-crawler. Since the app, Road to Legend, has been released this game can be enjoyed as a competitive as well as fully cooperative experience.

Furthermore there is a large community behind the game and by now an open source application called Valkyrie has come up, which basically works similar to the official coop-app, but also allows allows players to design their own fully cooperative scenarios and campaigns and share them with the community.

Between the normal one-versus-many campaigns of the base game and various expansions, the print-on-demand non-digital coop expansions, the official app, the official quest vault for user-made one-versus-many campaigns and scenarios and now the open source app: Descent offers such an excessive amount of replayability and content, that basically every single other dungeon crawler on the market pales in comparison.

Really great one-vs-many game, and an utterly masterful redesign of the first edition. The rules are very straightforward for a game with this much depth- of particular note for me are the "line of sight" rules, which in a game like this could easily threaten to derail a session with nitpicking and hair-pulling. These LOS rules are not realistic, but they are still tactical with clear parameters, and are a good example of a designer forcing players not to sweat the things that derail the gooey of a game.

Was looking for a dungeon crawl game and picked this up. Completed the Shadow Rune campaign, and now halfway through Manor of Ravens. Have also played single quests, co-op with the forgotten souls expansion as well as the Descent RPG variant and using the Road to Legend app. 

Have painted the base set minis

* Looove the tiles in the game. Lots of variations included
* Nice minis in the game. I just look at pics of the painted minis on BGG and drool.
* Different heroes with different classes play differently, so there is a lot of variation included in the box.
* The ruleset is simple and easy to follow.
* Some people complain about the game balance. While that is true for some quests, we mostly found it balanced. In our Shadow Rune campaign, the heroes won 5 quests (including Interlude & Finale) while the overlord won 3 quests.
* This is a purely tactical strategic game, there isn't much narrative involved
* The Road to Legend app is awesome!

The new version, which brought a new era to the life of our adventurers. The set up is much quicker, the stories are more managable and can be played for shorter time. It got a 9 from me, beacuse I loved the first editions treasure mechanism (everyone got someting, in the 2nd ed only the opener gets the treasure) and because now you have to make a successfull roll, and hope that the monster won't dodge it by making a perfect defense roll:D.

RATING: 6
I personally love it when games are close in the end. Unfortunately, this was never the case with Descent in any of my plays. A quest always ended with one side totally crushing the other side. Nearly all of the Act I quest are horribly unbalanced, e.g. Cardinal's Plight (Overlord), Castle Daerion (Overlord) and Death on the Wing (heroes).

The problem I see with this game is that there is too much randomness in it that never evens out during a quest because they are so short. The randomness comes from:
- The dice rolled for attacks
- The dice rolled for defense (this is the biggest problem regarding instant kills)
- The dice rolled for attribute tests
- The cards drawn by the Overlord
- The random elements in the quests (sometimes with additional attribute tests)

The biggest problem I have with this game:
The gameplay is not designed around fun but frustration. This includes the frequent attribute tests, where the Overlord is encouraged to pick on the same heroes over and over again. Also Overlord classes like Saboteur or Punisher penalize the heroes for achieving something or interrupt their actions. The campaign gets increasingly difficult for the side that loses often, making it pointless and frustrating to continue. Movement is very important for most of the scenarios and quest objectives, of course the Overlord is able to annoyingly hinder your movement in a variety of ways, leaving you standing around doing nothing. Also picking heroes with the right combination of attributes feels too important. Thus, if you play with a group that doesn't enjoy direct conflict in the meanest of ways, then they will pretty much hate this game.

And another problem:
The first quest (after the Introduction) will often decide the outcome of the whole campaign:
If the heroes win, they will pick their next quests from The Fat Goblin, Death on the Wing, and Masquerade Ball, most certainly winning all of these.
If the Overlord wins, he will pick Castle Daerion and Cardinal's Plight, winning both and with 3 wins under his belt, he will continue to win.

To summarize: FFG have once again shown that they are not capable of designing a balanced scenario-based game (other examples include 1st Edition Descent, Battles of Westeros, Mansions of Madness, Doom (2004), DOOM (2016), Tide of Iron, Tannhäuser, etc.).

Great components, system and scenarios. Bursting with theme.

I bought it to be a replacement for DND but failed for me since I can't be a GM like I imagined since it is basically a tactical miniature game and suspense gets thrown out since the players are made aware of the mission at the beginning.

Also, each campaign is a bubble and no continuity exists to the expansions which makes it impossible to continue the adventures of your well loved campaigned party.

Elsőre igazi pozitívum az elő kiadáshoz képest a kisebb doboz, a kisebb szörnyek. Jól néz ki az egész kivitelezés. Kicsit macerásabb a rálátás meghatározása, de logikusabb. Egyszerűbb a mozgás kivitelezése. Tetszett a hősök "halálának" új megoldása a korábbihoz képest. Tetszett, hogy kivették a várost és nincs teleportálgatás. Tetszett a sok küldetés, tetszettek a hősök, a képzettségeik, a fejlődési rendszerük. Ami nem tetszett, hogy kaland közben nem fejlődik már a hősünk csak egy-egy kaland végén, de összességében egyértelműen pozitív a változás. Jól megreformálták a játékot, de simán mehetett volna a BGG-n az első kiadás alá az új. Ettől függetlenül 7-est adok erre a kiadásra is, de mindenképpen ennek a megvételét ajánlom azok számára, akik a megvételén gondolkodnak.

Getting a group together that will spend 1 evening a week playing this is the hardest part.  Once you get that initial group it leaves you craving more.  You will spend the days after playing looking forward to the next quest.  The Overlord really has to think things through in order to achieve a victory and parts of the quests will make it feel like the Overlord does their part in less than a minute and then waits 15 minutes for the heroes to take their turn.  I recommend having an iPad near by so if you are the Overlord you can keep yourself busy while you wait.  Great game otherwise and with all of the expansions and user content it will never end!

I expect rating to go up when I play this as a campaign since that is how you will use most of the games content. Might give epic play a try as an alternative, but I didn't really like that mode of play in Mutant Chronicles: Siege of the Citadel, so I suspect campaign will be the way to go just like it was there.

Problem with basic one-shot scenario play is that without more abilities in play (as a reuslt of buying equipment or leveling up) the tactics are a bit simplistic. I haven't seen any potential for truly clever tactical play so far.

The heroes seem squishier than usual, which is fun for Overlord (attacking invincible looted up heroes can be frustrating) and in return the penalty for death is very low for the genre which takes away some excitement I think. Most missions for the Overlord seem to be based on "complete this objective by getting X and escaping", rather than just killing the heroes, slowing them down is the objective.

Rating with Basic Play No Campaign: (4 Design + 3 Enjoyment)

Simply the best game of it's type that I have ever played to date, that would cover all dungeon crawls and games like the D+D series (Ravenloft,Drizzt etc) that use minis.
  
   I am  playing some fantastic  scenarios  with just 2 players (4 heroes) at the moment and they are very well balanced.
  Solo or co-op scenarios are now available
 I am fortunate that I play with someone who is a keen overlord player (and good) and he is also willing to get involved in the story and theme which greatly adds to the enjoyment of this game.
  I usually pick semi-random or themeatic heroes ,if you were to pick purely the best then I imagine it could get stale. I have now played all the campaigns and only used 3 heroes more than once (I usually play 4 heroes).
  I feel that I must update my comment since the release of the Road to Legend app.  Although I am firmly against anything computerised in my board gaming this app proves there are exceptions, it greatly adds to what was already a great game. They seem to have got the AI right as you will lose if you don't play well even on normal setting. Even our overlord admits that it plays better than him and now loves being a hero and can't get enough of the treasure which he previously hated. Surprise encounters, buying items from town, dangerous perils, well set out adventures and a decent story have made this one of my very few 9.5's.  If you enjoy Dungeon Crawlers with a well thought out campaign nothing else comes close at the moment.

Love all the changes from the old edition: Easier to jump into/teach. Campaign rules right from the start. Streamlined gameplay (by cutting fiddly parts that brought nothing particularly interesting to the game to begin with). Conversion kit from the old edition means I instantly have 40+ heroes and a pile of monsters to use. Quests in the booklet are more customizable.

That anyone would prefer the old edition over this one completely baffles me.

Regardless of comparisons to the old edition, this is one of my all-time favourite board games. It's about as good a dungeon crawl as you'll ever find without jumping up to a full-on table-top RPG system. Loads of fun.

I was a huge proponent of Descent (first edition).  Dungeon crawls speak to me, and Descent 1e has always stood out to be as the best dungeon crawler available.  Personally, 2e has blown 1e away so far.  The only flaw I had with 1e was the length.  2e fixes that, and the way it was fixed (that I initially feared) is a stroke of genius, and works, and is highly enjoyable.  Being able to integrate 1e into the new edition is a huge plus.  Everything is just lovely.  I will own it forever. *update* - I've considered selling this off with all my Imperial Assault stuff to play.  I just don't see myself cracking open Descent again.  Times have changed!

My impressions after about 12 games with two heroes:
- the basic mechanics are great
- in this constellation (two heroes) it's incredibly imbalanced. Even when giving them one additional action each turn (so they have five in total) the overlord still kicked their butt in most scenarios and it just wasn't fun

After playing about 6 games of Star Wars: Imperial Assault, that game just seems superior. It has VERY similar mechanics (even the custom dice are almost the same), but they all got tweaked a little, so it feels smoother and way more balanced.

Unless you hate Star Wars, buy SW:IA instead of this.

I probably already have too many games that I will only play solo, but this one still looks pretty cool, esp with the app that allows for solo play. 

Update: Found this in an auction and pulled the trigger. Definitely worth it, though I don't know how much of the expansion material I'm willing to spend $$ on. Loads of fun so far and the app is very well done. 8/2017

I love this game.  It's the action, spell flinging, monster crunching parts of D&D without any of the hassle.  I will say though it feels like a bit of an 80s game that can be sometimes a bit too rough on players.. especially if they don't move fast enough.  Also, the difference the treasure/magic items make is a bit too heavy handed.  You might pick up a super dupe life-draining giant-decapitating, +5 sword (in which case you'll probably win the adventure) or you might pick up a great healing potion (in which case you'll probably lose) from the same deck.  I kind of like the hard hitting, unforgiving nature of it but sometimes it makes my players have a bit of a moan and whine.

I was a little let down by this game.  That's not to say it's not a good game, I enjoyed myself and look forward to playing again (we have a weekly group set up to run through a campaign).  I'm just saying I had lofty expectations of being blown away by it and I simply wasn't.

Part of it might be because my first (finally!) play of the game was just the introductory encounter.  That said though, I've been playing games long enough that I can usually decipher a lot of what I think about a game from a first play, even if it is a "learning game".

Descent is a very simplified and streamlined dungeon crawl.  A scenario is set up, each player plays a hero against an overlord player who manages all the monsters.  Each side has a win condition and heroes have abilities and equipment they can use to their advantage, as do the monsters plus the overlord has a hand of cards that allow him to use special abilities.  All of this fits into the usual fantasy tropes.

Where I was let down was I felt it was a bit TOO simplified and streamlined for my tastes.  Each hero starts with only 1 or 2 abilities and pieces of equipment and when he levels up the choices are pretty scant.  The maps are a bit claustrophobic and the scenarios (I've read through a few, which isn't cheating by the way, there's always 100% open information) are a bit too simple in their goals and how they're laid out.  I'm also a bit worried that it might suffer in the same way Mansions of Madness does in that while this has more content than Mansions it will still run out and playing through the same capaign repeatedly loses some of its flair.

I guess I'm just spoiled by my tabletop and digital RPG experiences but I just wanted more.  That said it still delivers quite a bit of fun and strategic gameplay and dilutes it down to 2 hours instead of 6.  And watching your character grow delivers a little bit of the same rewarding feeling you would get in those other RPGs.

I'm now currently playing as the Overlord and it is a little less fun because I have yet to win (with my other group, as the heroes, we always won as well).  I'm convinced that this game is not very well balanced for the heroes vs. the Overlord and it has a bad rich get richer problem.  Once heroes in this game realize how powerful the items make them they will strive to get all the treasure counters in each scenario and continue to get stronger while the little bit of advancement the Overlord gets in the form of one time use cards they may or may not see does not even out this experience.

Some of the expansions include a little bit more powerful monsters but it is too little, the game is very one sided.  In the end though the amount of content and the game play keeps bringing me back.  I also enjoy the challenge enough and I've come close to winning a couple times so the motivation and hope that I will win at least one quest is still there.  It's just a much more fun game as the heroes and if this sounds incredibly frustrating to you, you should always stay away from the Overlord role.

I FINALLY won one quest, the second half of Death on the Wing.

This game is very tactical, which is a bit of surprise after some other dungeoncrawlers. You will certainly not win if your strategy is to just kill everything. 

One drawback is that it requires a dedicated group to get the full experience, and I have had a difficult time getting that going.

Played a few scenarios of this with Liz. I really liked it, especially the dice for different weapons etc., but she really didn't see the point. It was just a luck-fest for her with the dice, so might as well have just rolled a dice to see if she wins or not. We had a bit of a barny about it, but a) noted, she doesn't like this kind of game, and b) as my main playing partner was now gone, I've given this away to John. Happy b'day 2013, John!

Sept 2016 update - there's now an app to run the overlord, so when I saw this at Dave's comics I picked it up. Tutorial so far, and good! Lots of surprises.

Dear Fantasy Flight,

you are forgiven for Gears of War, Mansions of Madness, RuneAge, Dust Tactics, lord of the rings and every other pile of chromed up, pedestrian playing, lacking in imagination, poorly playtested, piece of donkey do from the last three years because this game is genius.

The system is so stripped down from a rules read through it looks shallow, but game play is just so tense and involving unimpeded by 10,000 chits or Terrinoth waffle (its there but the table looks less like a town centre pavement after pub closing and more like a mission). For once the design hits the spot, game first, chrome second. This is the grail Dungeon crawl - the rules are simple, 15 minutes setup per encounter and and an hour or so play per scenario. Plus there is a campaign, with incremental development for both Players and Overlord. At no point does the game stall and at the trackable information is at just the right level - its possible to keep it all in view and mind yet theres enough going to provide depth to the story and meaningful choices for all participants. A huge improvement on Descent - which was damn fun to begin with. Where there was grind there is now flow, where every encounter went on longer than a Frankie Howard death scene now there is one decisive, bloody and brief tipping point...

I really wanted to like Descent a lot more than I did. The problem we all had with it was that it was a little boring and loose on many of the rules. The game was fun at times, but often this felt fleeting as one scenario or another would be seriously imbalanced toward either the hero or overlord side. Ultimately, we gave up on our campaign around Act II because the story itself was just so boring and ended up trying Labyrinth of Ruin instead, which was a terrible choice. I'd play this again, but it would have to be with a consistent group.

(disclaimer:  I have only played this game once at the time of writing this).

The game lives up to the hype of being probably the best "Dungeon Crawl" game ever.  The game is fun, with a lot of variability in the different missions that can be played.  

Having only played one game of this, I obviously have not experienced the full campaign mode, but feel that this will only improve the game, in my opinion.

I like this dungeon crawler a lot but I think it will eventually get replaced with a co-op. I don't mind playing as the overloard but the game is best when played as a campaign and I don't think I'll ever get to do that. There is a lot the heroes and overlord will never see when only playing a quest here and there at level one.

Overall I really enjoy going through the coop missions & I'm looking forward to the app.

RATING: 6
Overall, a nice game because of the built-in campaign.
Otherwise it is a watered-down and rather boring version of first edition.

In a few areas the game has improved, adding innovations such as character classes and skill trees but overall it gives players less choices and seems oversimplified without an epic feeling. 
Either you win or lose an encounter, the difference (reward-wise) is tiny. No matter how badly you get slaughtered by the overlord, you both just gain 1xp and he gains a minor bonus and vice versa.

I would always play the 1st edition campaign (Road to Legend) if i had the choice. It feels much more gamey, requires more involvement and planning in character development and is not as forgiving if you fail an encounter.

+ Skill trees/Character classes.
+ Monster group activation.
+ Encounters have alternative ways of winning rather than simply kill em' all and escape.
+ Built-in campaign.

- Not so epic as 1st edition.
- Many rules are oversimplified and leave players with few choices.(No threat,no hero respawn,no city actions,no guaranteed potions etc.)
- Few combat dice

Rating after 6 plays.
First the bad news. Raw have the worst LOS rules ever. Easy to work out but defying all logic. 
Had to switch to point to point LOS to enjoy game. Far more intuitive and just as easy to work out IMHO. 

Now the good news. I love everything else about this game. The Campaign mode is made up of 9 quests, most of which are quick two part encounters that can be played and recorded separately. The second of each of these encounters offers an additinal relic item to reward your future quests. The first encounters offer no reward but does determine the  difficulty of the prize-giving second encounter for the heroes. If the heroes do badly in the first encounter it will be very difficult for them to win the second. 

There are tech tree abilities to be developed for both the heroes and the Overlord. Equally interesting choices for both.  

Great components, and well designed quests that encourage a race through the dungeon or map rather than a drawn out slugfest. 

Rating could go up to an 8 or 9 after more plays if the quests are balanced and varied enough.

I love the idea of games like this and the campaign has a great story to follow. The main issue I had with this was the imbalance between the teams when playing with the maximum number of players. I'd like to play a variant with a hero moving then an overlord group, then back to a hero until all models have been moved to mitigate the effects of hero's ganging up on minions.

2nd edition fixes a lot of the problems from first edition. The gameplay is fast, with quests taking 2 hours or less. Actions are dynamic and combat is more exciting and less number crunching. Built in campaign is a nice feature, but it comes at the cost of weak single session play. Skill selections are interesting.

Some confusing rules. Some characters and class options suck. Some broken scenarios. The last is inexcusable at this point. Also, while the Hero selection finally acknowledges that women exist, the quests are stupidly sexist.

I want to like it so much, but I feel it is too easy, in the base game, for the heroes to roll over the overlord (see what I did there?). It takes too much tension out of the game when I know my party can destroy everything you throw at it. Still fun anyway, but could be a lot more balanced.

Played the intro. Theme is good, decks and replayability looks promising. Some fiddly rules though, even Doom was more structured.

Going for Claustrophobia or Gears of War for my 'Dungeon Crawler'-slot, I guess.

Dropped off my wishlist.

[EDIT NOV 2014] Played through a couple of scenarios with four friends and though balance is still far off, it is a nice pastime. Compared to Gears of War, GoW requires more thought. Line-of-sight of Descent are still wonky, beats me why they didn't take center-to-center as in almost all other games. Even though, back on my wish list (preferably with some expansions to go with it, as I see variation in characters in base set wearing out fast).

With the right players this game is great fun.  Some of the scenarios are very video game like but they work for what it is. The set up for these scenarios might not be worth it but I can live with that for some dungeon slashing goodness.

update : Having played some scenarios twice now I see how good tactical maneuvering can really change each one.  Very cool.  It's a simple system in favor of easy moves by the heroes but it works well to keep the fun factor high.  Dice rolls are stand up tense in some situations.  I hope with more plays (in the campaign) it will get a better sense of leveling up for the heroes.

update: Now, halfway through the campaign this game has really become a great time.  We usually have at least 4/5 players and are really getting our characters development going on.  We switch out the overlord role seamlessly.  I'm excited to see the strength of the part two monsters.  Everyone is getting expansions so we will have a nice crop of monsters to contend with.

update: Finally played through an entire campaign.  It really can get tough in the second act.  Some quests are pretty easy due to the massively powerful heroes at this point.  Great game that I am willing to muster up the energy to play it for extended periods of time.

Wonderful D&D-style board game with a lot of really deep RPG mechanics.

The only thing that makes me sad is that Descent is best played as a Campaign game, where you play through all the quests in the campaign in order. You *can* play one-off games--just choose a quest, make some characters, and throw them in there--but it's not quite as much fun.

It's also a fairly unforgiving game. This is *NOT* a leisurely dungeon crawl. Every quest has an objective, and you have to run after it as fast and hard as you can or you'll get crushed.

It is a fun causal hack and slash role playing game. Set up the board, and have fun. Make sure your overlord is not much better than the players, there might be some bickering if the overlord steamrolls the players. The players are up to 4, but the overlord is only one person. Much better if 4 people are in a good mood than 4 people being in a bad mood :)

This game suffers from a really strong snowball mechanic. If one of the parts gets ahead, they get can get really far ahead, and there are no stopping it.

The first edition was my favorite game of all time. This version takes everything good from that version, streamlines it and makes it quicker and better.

Now you can easily play this in 90 minute stretches instead of the 3+ hours it took the original. This makes it so much better.

To add to this, Fantasy Flight released a free app with a basic tutorial campaign and full fledged campaign for smartphones and Steam(PC).

With all of these changes, I finally was able to get my wife to play a game I never thought she would. For that, my favorite game of all time continues to stay that way.

I like the improvements in this over First edition.  But it still feels long to me, and I'm not sure this type of game interests me much anymore.  I like tactical games, but I might be done with D&D style now.  Or at least, that's not an overall appealing theme to me as much anymore.

We haven't played this since the addition of the app to make it co-op. Beautiful pieces, atmosphere, and plenty of strategy to plan your moves. It may be a bit too easy for the overlord player to win, so when we are playing two players, a skilled overlord can make it not so fun for the other player. Eager to try the app some day.

I hated this with two players but a full group brought lots of fun.  So far it feels a bit weighed against the Overlord, but my group overstrategizes on everything.  This has been a great weekly addition to our collection and I expect to get the expansions when we tire of the base set.

Descent was one game designer's answer to a gaming group that didn't want to play a proper tabletop RPG. With that in mind it does manage to provide the character growth mechanic that is so crucial to the genre. But every encounter is basically yet another combat slog with a special objective for each side. (Usually "kill everything" isn't directlly useful, and in fact if you try to optimize for it you will probably fail hard.) It was cute the first few sessions, but an entire campaign of Descent is just too monotonous.

Much "quicker" system than Descent 1st ed. There is a lot to like over the original: built in campaign, simplified LOS, shorter scenarios, much better quality models. 

The game itself is much faster. You can still play a large number of quests if you want a lot of game. If you are strapped for time, you can play a single encounter fairly quickly.

**Update June 2016
FFG came out with an app that automates the overlord (much like the standalone co-op adventures), but campaign style. So now this can be a true solo or co-op game. Unfortunately you cannot play the content that comes with the game and its expansions, you only play the content in the app. Thankfully, there are a couple of really good manual automated systems out there.

This is a great dungeon crawler whether you play the overlord vs players (though that isn't always balanced) or one of the many options for solo/co-op play. There is a wealth of expansions to increase the different heroes, archetypes, monsters, etc. This is the third generation of this system (Doom, Descent 1st ed, this) and the system grew again with Imperial Assault - in fact, a couple of the solo systems use a similar turn order as IA. At any rate, it is a lot of fun. FFG has done a great job in making Campaigns (though the original base set campaign is not very good, the others are good and the base set was replaced by Heirs of Blood in other editions - for those with the original, you can purchase the hardbound HoB campaign book.

As compared with Descent, first edition, the game is now a much more streamlined, tactical combat game. This is good and bad. I miss the exploration. On the other hand, the game is now a true contest between players and DM. I appreciate the included campaign mode (something I always thought that the first edition should have included from the get-go). I also enjoy the game as an experience -- albeit one to be enjoyed once in a while on a lazy Saturday with friends. Personally, I'd rather play D&D 4E or one of the new D&D board games, but my buddies want Descent -- and so we play Descent. I'm not invested enough in the genre to make demands.

Not very well balanced.  In my play of this, my character only moved once and then the overlord spawned monsters next to my character and basically killed my character every turn.  Even though my team won (all of the monsters were busy killing me), it wasn't much fun for me.  

I'm sure if I played again, I could do a little better.  For example, I could take a double move at the beginning of the game to get away from the spawn point.  However, I'm not sure I'm interested in trying it again.  Perhaps with time, I might consider trying it again.

RATING: 8
So much fun. Each person is a different class with different abilities; there is a campaign that consists of several quests; you can level up your character to gain new abilities; you can find treasure during missions; you can buy and sell equipment; each scenario has different objectives. Just great.

My rating is also based on the system as a whole, not just the base game. The base game is okay, but when you add some of the expansions you have a ton of variety in heroes, monsters, items, quests, and classes.

[b]Road to Legend update:[/b] After many, many games of Descent, I have to say that the one-vs-all nature of the game is its biggest drawback. It tends to create frustration: either the overlord is getting crushed and has a table full of other players who are all celebrating his defeat, or the overlord gets the advantage and gleefully attacks the disgruntled players.

Road to Legend turning the game into a pure co-op is brilliant. It works great and is very similar to Mansions of Madness 2.0, where the app just tells you how to set everything up and it keeps up with a few things, but it doesn't get in the way or take over the game.

The app keeping up with heroes' gold and xp is takes away all of the bookkeeping that you had to do previously. The town section is great because it gives you some real choices between quests now: take time to refresh the shop to hope for better items, go on some sidequests, or do special activities to gain more gold or xp.

My only complaint with the app is that sometimes things aren't very clear. If you put out a unique monster, the app will still act as though you have put out both master and minion versions of the monster. This initially created quite a bit of confusion. Also some of the directions aren't completely clear. In one mission each hero's specific gear was spread around the map. If you find someone else's gear then they immediately equip it even if they're not nearby. It seems like the intent was for each player to recover their own gear, but the app didn't say so.

Overall I'm loving the game with the Road to Legend app. The app itself is mostly great, and the game is even better as a pure co-op.

Quite a good fast play fantasy boardgame. Not really a dungeon crawler as the maps, treasure and monsters are all laid out in advance. More of a very light wargame. I also didn't see much difference playing using Nerdooks D6 variant to the videos I've seen of Myth. The main one seems to be that each turn your heroes skills in Myth are random as they are dealt with a card draw. I'll keep playing D2e for the mo.

Mechanically it too often ends up not feeling like a bunch of heroes battling and looting through a gauntlet to victory.  It feels more like players gaming the system by doing our best to run away from most fights and skip the loot, while the overlord mostly uses the shrink/expand monster moves to barricade us and ride out the clock.

I'm not sure how meaningful my rating is here.  I feel as though I may be suffering from some Descent snobbery - as in "Pah!  It's not as good as the original!"  At the same time, so far I'd say this game is a teetering see-saw between fabulous ideas and badly botched balance and mechanics.  Yet in spite of that, I am making plans to play full-weekend marathon sessions anyway.

Addendum: Having played full-weekend sessions, I'm done with this.  There is no reason for me to ever play this over the remarkable first edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
An improved version of the classic dungeon crawler that streamlines efficiently the experience.

Compared to the original, this one is actually playable within a respectable time frame, without losing anything in theme or flavor. There is enough variety in heroes/monsters and missions, and the replayability reaches further limits with the campaign system that quite simply elevetes the game a whole level. The game also appears to have more interesting decisions, both for the heroes and the overlord, while being quite interesting as a narrative.

There are several problems however. First of all some aspects have been overly simplyfied for the sake of speed and flow of play. Exporation has been very restricted, to the point that this can hardly be called a dungeon crawler and should be called a tactical game with a very elegant campaign system. However the game also lacks in tactics, as the positioning, movement and line of sight have been nearly nullified, making all tactics revolve around which action to pick and which enemy to target. The overlord is still there of course, and that's always a big minus for me, but at least he is much more involved now. Also there are significant balance issues with the scenarios, that are only somewhat resolved through the errata. Finally the reviving/respawning mechanism works, but is quite unfun for me as it creates plentiful situations where you don't care to attack/defeat said hero/monster.

All in all Descent 2 is a nearly enjoyable experience. It's still a fantasy luck-fest, but it's a playable and well represented one, with an involving and interesting campaign system but poor and simple scenarios. All in all, a fair choice for ameri"trash" lovers, but a pass for the rest.

Update: There are now two official co-op modes for this game, one with a certain chain of expansions that started with forgotten souls and another one with the co-op application. I find them fairly similar and both great, especially compared to the base game that is a completely different experience. I consider the Descent co-op experience among the best adventure one I've had. I currently rate the co-op part of Descent a 9.5, and the overlord one a 4, hence the middle 6.75

What I like:

-It's the quintessential dungeon crawler experience. beautiful minis, great back story, fun and varied hero characters, cool dice, great gear and hero upgrades, beautiful and varied scenarios, a great big campaign and the option of playing shorter one-off games. 

What dislike: 
-The game isn't that well balanced unfortunately. This is both in regards to the heroes (Sorry dwarf but you're out), and the different maps strongly favoring heroes or overlord. Also, even if the maps are actually well-balanced (as in win rate of 50/50), often times the randomness in the game is going to make an utter humiliation of one side. Some maps actually end before the overlord even gets their first turn because of broken hero power combos in certain maps. There is also vastly different balance between 2,3 or 4 hero setup.
Too much setup. The fact that a single quest is split into two parts is cool in theory, but it means that you basically have to set up the game twice, which is a bit of a pain (with having to find the right tiles every time)

RATING: 9
Wow, I was really impressed with this game.  Back in the 80's I was all over Hero quest, loved it.  I was looking for a game to capture that feeling but be more up to date and this really nailed it.  

It's not that difficult to learn and the mechanics just feel really slick.  Combat is easy, one roll of the dice and you've got your range, power and surges.  Tiles are double sided, one side for inside and the other outside (which I thought was neat).  The overlord player has a goal (like the heroes) instead of just to kill the heroes.  The campaign system is really well thought out, quests are seperated into 2 parts with the first part having an effect on how easy / difficult the second part will be for either party.  Even the map at the back of the book which tells you the terrain you'll travel over in order to get to the start of the quest you're undertaking (you draw a card for different terrains which can mean good or bad things happen at the start of the quest - further you travel the more cards you draw).

Anyway, I was really impressed, great game.  Always well up for a blast on this game.  Oh and I feel like the heroes and overlord are pretty equal in terms of how much fun you'll have so i'm not gutted to have to play either (in heroquest I didn't like being the overlord player).

Really good game. I played a lot of RPG video games growing up (Diablo, Final Fantasy, etc.) as well as hero quest, and this scratches that itch.

I would like to run another campaign someday.

I started my real boardgame craze this month (May, 2017) after wanting to stop playing so many video games. This is the first game I've gotten during the craze (waiting on Folklore: The Affliction and Barbarians: The Invasion) and I've played the tutorial campaign twice now with the application Road to Legend.

Man this game is awesome! It's just big. Lots of things to setup and store, especially with the mini's taking up some space. The missions can also vary wildly in time depending on how well you roll. You need a reasonably big table and I'd say roughly around 2 hours for each session. This isn't a game you rush in.

The Campaign mode from what I've seen so far (the physical book and looking on youtube) seems excellent. Easily can dump 20 hours in a campaign (which is around 9 missions I believe). 

Definitely a nice game to pick up if you like miniature combat, high fantasy, RPGs and dungeon crawling!

The fantasy theme and the RPG feel are what draws me and my friends to this game. Set-up and gameplay take a while so you need a night just for this, especially if you plan on doing a bigger campaign. Slightly suffers from me being the owner of the game and thus being most familiar with the game means I often end up as overlord during sessions. Sometimes, I just want to kill some monsters. 

Update for app: The app is a great way to play Descent and I prefer it over the regular version. I'd rate the app a solid 9. The overall campaign, option to save game and the innovative design all make it a good app.

For a game with a strong element of theme, Descent made efforts to make no sense: from the movement of the monsters to the undying heroes (this avoid player elimination, I get it, but the dying aspect should have more to it).

Of the scenarios that we played (six of them) only half were somewhat balanced. The others seemed border-line broken (Castle Daerion is the main offender). We were playing a campaign, but give it up due to the many issues we have with the game.

Goodbye, Descent, we won't miss you.

RATING: 8
Enjoyable dungeon crawler.

Hard to know if the game is balanced or not...I feel what with all the expansions and the new mechanics/rules added to Star Wars: Imperial Assault, a third edition is perhaps needed.

It is a pain as the Overlord to get hammered before you can even get a go - rather than you having a go after a hero has moved, as would be the case with SW:IA.

Line of sight works better in SW:IA too, so I recommend using that set of rules instead.

Also, some monsters seem a lot worse than others...

Campaign fizzled. There's really no story here. I'm getting tired of using the same monsters all the time, but it's hard to see myself investing very heavily at this point. On the other hand, if I need a slutty dice roller with some cool minis that has each side thinking the other has an unfair advantage, it fits the bill. Not sure what to do with this one.

RATING: 4.5
I've played a few games with the road to legend app. They've been fiddly and clunky enough that we'll never be tempted to try the Overlord vs heroes mode of the game. Too many of the rules are on special ability cards and the game lacks the streamlining of something like Zombicide BP or the more interesting tactical depth of something like Claustrophobia.

The app-based gameplay seemed to make more sense in Mansions of Madness as there are more plot elements and puzzles to be revealed. I'll definitely keep the game in the hope that there are some better scenarios being developed.

+ Great looking game.
+ Love the Hero class system.
+ Love the dice system.

- Disconnect between theme and mechanics. Feels more like a skirmish type game, than a dungeon crawler.
- Scenarios feels too gimmicky.
- Too many new rules/conditions for each scenario.
- Too small "dungeons".
- I HATE that monsters just respawn for free. It nearly breaks the game for me.

RATING: 4
Awesome dungeon crawl with lots of variety. Quests are quick, so it's easier to get this game on the table. One quest just take a couple of hours, including setup. Have yet to start a campaign, though, so the score could go up. 

I have some reservations so far though. The winner of a quest seems to be decided pretty early in encounter 1 if one side does well. The movement and LOS rules might be too loose, and might take out some of the tactical elements. It speeds up gamplay, though. And I fear that each quest could be "solved", especially in what monsters the OL should pick. Will see how these reservations turn out, so the score could go down.

I'm not sure this edition represents an improvement, if anything a simplification, over the original. I had to get it only to enable the upgrade expansion for all the original edition expansions I already have. I'm hoping this increased the amount of game plays for Descent in the future, but so far the simple plays of this edition were nothing spectacular.

This game has ups and downs to it. The good components included has already been re-used for other gaming purposes. The tools and tons of online material makes it a game that will last a long time. You do not need all the expansions to get a good game going. The bad things about it is that the turns can swing a lot and you can really max out on the heroes turn (or vice versa) to really cripple the game. Can be dumbed down a bit and enjoyed with children as well.

The included app mechanics are nice to introduce others to the game. A LOT of fan made content. A LOT of things to make up your own adventures.

Never played the first edition, but Descent 2nd edition is a great dungeon crawler. Very different from crawlers in my own collection like Warhammer Quest and Super Dungeon Explore, in that it is both more tactical (more open information, lots of different skills per hero) and more predictable (less encounters/event rolls). Too bad I am not a big fan of this fantasy setting, but otherwise there is very little to dislike about this game. Looking forward to my next play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A streamlined version of the first edition, the rules have been simplified where the storytelling and quests take center stage. While I found the first edition tedious, the second edition scenarios have thus far been quite short and flows extremely well. I especially enjoy how the line of sight works as well as the lack of threat tokens for the overlord. Simplifying these few things make the game significantly easier to swallow for newbies and non-hard core fantasy gamers. Plus, the pre-packaged story arc has been quite engaging and keeps our gaming group (which is Euro-centric) interested. Being overlord, the only worry I have is the repetitive nature of hunting down creatures and getting to the missions. I do hope that there will be more variation to the quests further down the scenarios to keep the gamers excited. Thumbs up for the changes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
It's a very thematic dungeon crawler, with some strategy, and luck in rolling dices. I love that dark lord can cast spells, and he's not limited to playing with his monster army. Heroes also have many skills, including his character skills, and class skills. Some are passive, some are active, and they have one really powerful once per match skill, that can change tide of battle. Game gets better with every match, and can be very addicting.

However, it may be frustrating at some points, because understanding special rules for missions/camapaign and then making a board from the puzzle-like tiles can take a long slice of time, before we even start a game. Not to mention, a game itself can be long too. Also, your wallet might not like this game, since getting more missions, classes, characters etc. requieres you to buy more expansions. There's a lot of them, and like a base game, they can be pretty expensive for what they offer. Base game alone is okay, but sooner or later you may get bored with only few options to choose from items/classes/characters/spells/monsters, and even missions.

Anyway, it's a very good game. Would buy again, and again. With expansions.

now it's time to have fun!
great change from the first edition!

7/18/2012 - Just opened up the box and punched out all the cardboard pieces. I'm a bit disappointed with the quality of the components. A few of my miniature bases were warped, another couple were bent.  The cardboard tiles are a little flaky on the ends. The cards are of nice quality. This is my first Fantasy Flight game, and I've always heard how great the quality of their games are, but after opening up Descent and checking out my pieces, I'm sorta bummed. :(

7/21/2012 - I played First Blood again, and the Fat Goblin for the first time. Combat really feels like D&D.  It was an enjoyable game. So far, the biggest negative of the game is Descent really needs an extra pair of dice!

This rating is based on the co-op module released as a game night kit from Fantasy Flight. The co-op is spectacular and a lot of fun. I was a bit worried about my purchase of Descent after playing the first question in the campaign but the co-op has wiped those worries away. It's tense and there's a ton of dice rolling and some decision making along the way. 

If you're looking for a dungeon crawl, Descent 2 with the co-op module is where it's at!

Pretty disappointing purchase for me. At first, I was excited at the concept of DnD in a box, with combat that seemed more tactical than the regular tabletop rpg. Instead what I received was a game where combat was determined largely by lucky dice rolls (which was what I disliked the most about DnD), and many scenarios which required heroes to rush to the exit over slaying monsters. For how fiddly the game was, and how long it would take me to explain the game to new players, Descent just didn't have the depth to keep me engaged. At the end I still kept this game for the minis and components, but as a game I wish there was more to combat that simple positioning and dice chucking.

Ameritrash dungeon crawl with game master. A great improvement over the first edition this game pits a team of heroes against a dungeon filled with threats and challenges.

horrible, horrible game. You setup the game for about half an hour, discuss what to do first (takes again about half an hour), roll dice to see if it works (which it never does), regret not having rolled the dice first to save some time, await your fate (the overlord's turn) realize that you don't have any chance to win it anymore but still try to do so for another three hours...
This is just an absolute terrible game, I have never been that bored and destroyed about a game, just don't want to touch anything that has to do with descent anymore

RATING: 8.5
Very good dungeon crawl with fun character progression and campaigns. However, while I do like the winner choose style of campaigns, I do feel like the storyline could be stronger or more cohesive. Also, it can occasionally seem like the overlord can "stack his deck" due to the 2 act structure of most quests which will generally ale the second act, the most important act to win, very one sided if the overlord decides to be cruel.  However, if you have a fair handed overlord this is seldom an issue.  Overall though, great game.

RATING: 7.3
Great systems and a ton of potential, but terribly unbalanced with only two players. Need to find a bigger party willing to play this to make it more enjoyable.

RATING: 8.5
While this doesn't feel like a true dungeon-crawler, I have always liked the idea of being the Overlord. Playing against a human makes life a bit more challenging for adventurers, and the game pulls that off well. While character customization is a bit weak, it does seem to offer much more than the D&D co-op game I've played, especially with the campaign. 

Overall, I think the game strikes a nice balance between board game and dungeon crawl, and for that I'm grateful. I get that RPG itch scratched, even if the relief is short lived. This is easier to get to the table than every RPG I'm dying to play. 

I don't know if all of the App quests are this way, but the 1 I've played so far did feel more like a dungeon crawl with limited knowledge of what's to come.

Although I never actually played the 1st edition, I really like how the 2nd edition, especially the campaign mode, is set up.  You can easily play an act (both encounters) in under 2 hours, and can pick back up where you left off fairly easily, giving the game an epic adventure feel without having to dedicate an entire weekend.  I'm not sure as to the balance of power in each of the scenarios, but my first 5 hours of game play were very enjoyable.

This was my gateway game really. Does everything I craved from Hero Quest and Space Crusade as a child. Tactile and immersive, it's a toy box of fantasy adventures. Creates great moments of story in game. Character progression give it a moreish quality. Just lovely. Having just completed the core campaign (finally) I'm so keen to play more. Curse all these expansions!

Edit: It's great but struggle to play campaign games.

I do love this.  There are some aspects that got improved in Imperial Assault that I really prefer.  
But dammit this is immersive and even going through the scenarios a second time doesn't do much to hinder replayability because of the character/class system that is so rich and makes forming your party something you can discuss for days before actually pulling them together to begin a campaign.  
If you like campaign games and the fantasy aspects, do it.  Must do it.  
If you don't like having multiple game nights monopolized as you progress a few maps further, stay the hell away.

Descent is the best implementation of RPG mechanics to a board game that I've found. Each quest is dynamic and requires different strategies to do well. Each class is different but feels like an essential part of the team. The campaign is where all these mechanics shine, with a fantastic feeling of slowly building your character and accruing new equipment. The overlord, while still fun, isn't nearly as satisfying to upgrade.
9/10 for a campaign game as a hero
8/10 for the overlord.

RATING: 7
I also like Descent 1st edition, but i really haven't 4 hour in a row to play a quest. D2E preserve the flavor and fun of 1st Ed. but is way much faster to setup and play. Don't get fooled by the "cute" graphics of the characters or by the simple rules, this is a very complete game that can be very appealing to hard core gamers and former D&D players. Even if you have a preset map and enemies from the beginning of the quest you have plenty of tactics at you disposal especially as the overlord. To enjoy this game at best you have to play the campaign mode which is very well implemented.

Why this is not a full 10?
For the price tag i would like to have in the box another set of dice and some tokens to record XPs.

Anyway this is a tremendously fun game and i can't wait to play another quest!
 
Edit after several plays - maybe it is a little frustrating for the OL i found hard to win a quest as the OL so i downgrade it to 8

When I had watched Rodney Smith play Descent 2.0 for the first time I knew I had to get this game. And I knew I had to have painted minis like he did. So, first I got into miniature painting and when I was confident in my skill (which is not much to be honest) I bought the game and spent 3 months painting before our very first game. We are currently into our 3rd quest in the campaign and we are all hooked. Our gaming nights are now Descent nights and we just can't wait for the next week to move on with the story...

Not my cup of tea as they say. I think this game should have been much shorter adn there are better games out there that do basically the same thing of moving your heroes around and beating the baddies.

RATING: 8
A fun game for the right group of gamers, but the "one vs many" approach can lead to some animosity and argument when things get tight, especially since one of the players (the Overlord) feels like they are in a tyrannical position of authority over the other players. The game is also a little skewed in terms of difficulty depending on the number of players there are; the more players, the harder it is for the Overlord to win, which can lead to an unfair late-game (3 players feels like the sweet spot for my group).

Great flavor and mechanics here though, and the dice used for combat are intuitive and versatile.

Edit: Now that the overlord can be fully automated by the new Descent app, we've been getting a lot more use out of this game. Great fun to play with the app for those who, like me, weren't fond of the "one vs many" element.

RATING: 6
This game is significantly better than the first edition, which was a decent game, but way too long.  This game features more interesting quests, a streamlined treasure system, and better overlord play.  In all, it's an admirable reimagining.

That said, some of the flaws from the first edition remain.  The game still tends to go all or nothing early.  If the heroes can wipe out the early monsters and keep trucking, they will probably win the quest easily, whereas if the Overlord can put the heroes in jeapardy with an early group of monsters, she'll probably keep them on the ropes until she can pull off her own easy victory.  The combat system is still rather fiddly, and there are certain abilities that are prone to abuse.

This is now the best fast, RPG-style board game I've played, but it begs the question: Is it really that big of a deal to have an RPG-style board game?  Isn't playing an actual RPG a better experience?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Descent has great strategic potential, a lot of replay value and the option to easily make your own content.
The game does definitely promote strategy and tactic a lot more than most other boardgames I know, so ideally it should be played with roughly equally experienced players to enjoy it fully.

RATING: 4
UPDATE: Downgraded to six. I've tried it with all of our playgroups - two player, and three player. Hasn't really taken off with any of them. Two player, it seemed like a lot of work for a medium-weight duel. Three player with an RPG player, he preferred RPGs and didn't see the advantage. The third playgroup tried playing it as a heavy-duty combo card game. In all cases, it was 'meh'. We have fond memories of Descent: First Edition - this hasn't really cut the mustard. Not epic enough and the early scenarios feel oddly repetitive.

Takes everything I loved about Descent 1st Edition and makes it better. A brilliant, replayable tactical combat game - lots of play and options. Simply wonderful.

What a gorgeous, complex, thematic game. It's a fantastic substitute that bridges the gap between full RPGs and extremely complex fantasy strategy games. Once you have a dedicated group of people to play with, you can really excel into the fun parts of the story and develop real characters and strategies. It also really pushes the limit of game dynamics, pitting one person against several others. This can be taxing on friend groups, but it's important to play the game the same way you might play any other RPG -- for the fun. Even if you lose, you get some laughs in.

Only started recently playing this game, but I can already realize the amazing gameplay Descent involves. A great dungeon crawler, with a really awesome story mode. (And we are only playing through the first campaign!) Again, I really enjoy the asynchronous play between the overlord and the heroes, as both strive to be victorious. The one thing that could derail the game is that because of the immense strategy involved, turns can last fairly long. But I can look past that, as I am accustomed to longer games. A great game for sure!

I'm sure descent is a fine game but it feels too much like watered down D&D for me.  The mechanics are fine, the game is well conceived and everything although it has a striking similarity to Doom.

Wow, it really is a perfect adventure game. If you want to get someone into RPGs, I'd imagine playing the new Descent is the best idea ever! The rules are very simple and the game is so much fun to play, the atmosphere is right up there with any dungeons and monsters game.
The new edition has some issues (like not very intuitive LOS and movement rules, no player death), but these are actually very minor flaws. Plays like a breeze - from here it's really easy to get into some DnD mechanics. I really look forward to any expansions!

The second edition streamlined the game a lot. The maps are now a lot smaller for Campaign play and the Overlord doesn't feel like as much of a threat(pun intended). Though, the character development is much better and being able to play a game in less than 3-4 hours is fantastic.

A very good dungeon crawler. It's very fun to prepare a scenario as the dungeon master and try to set up a strategy.

The only two points of critique are that I feel the manual is not always clear and/or logical. My group seemed to especially have trouble with the movement of big monsters.

The other is the setting, it's a very generic fantasy setting: Elves, Orcs, Goblins, ... With similar games in the Star Wars and Turtles universa, I'd only get this if I didn't like the other themes. Nevertheless, this one does have a lot of extra stuff you can buy....

Fantasy Flight put their creative team to work and cleaned up the many problems with the 1st edition.  Spawning is sane, playtime is manageable, defense dice are a welcome addition (grifted from Heroscape?), the win conditions are interesting, and the scenarios are creative and well-done. Holy cow, I may actually get this played on game night and finish before the bell tolls.

I feel bad only because I sank my life savings into the original and my family's Road to Legend campaign (untouched for two years) may go unfinished.  My only consolation is that the 1st edition minis will see the light of day occasionally as "open groups" on the 2nd edition maps - thanks to the conversion kit.

The release of a clean and sober 2nd edition may also mean that Sea of Blood will remain forever unopened in my basement.  Based on the majority of reviews, though, this can only be a good thing.

[i]Update[/i]:

The many-against-overlord mechanic is finally starting to grate on me.  The biggest problem with these games is that monster actions are 100% dictated by an omniscient player, meaning that monsters always perform the perfect move/attack for any given situation.

The other problem is that many monster abilities don't matter.  The only thing that does matter is that monsters can block exits.  That's the single best power that a monster can possess, and it's the most annoying ability available - by far.  And since all monsters have this ability, by default all monsters will always be annoying.  In terms of game design, that's not a good thing.

So, introducing a degree of randomness into monster movement would have been a good idea.  Though now I'm less inclined to purchase additional expansions, so all the better for me and my pocketbook.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I understand what the game is trying to do. It is a game that is trying to come close to a RPG in the form of a dungeon crawl.

However, this game is too much hack and slash. Except for the hack and slash dungeon crawl there is no other RPG experience except for going to town and buying things. There is a narrative story, but it makes no difference to the overall play of the game except for maybe an objective during the combat hack and slash phase which is the majority of the game. There are no puzzles or player interactions such as making critical/moral choices. As a result, I feel like there is something missing when I play. All I am really doing is moving and rolling dice. I'd prefer to play Pathfinder which presents much more of an open world and I can create my own terrain for combat.

The Descent App is a nice edition to take the role of the overlord. It also helps with the narrative of the campaign you are allegedly on. Again, to me, this addition does not change the fact that this is primarily a hack and slash system.

This is why I gave it a 6.5.

Needs some rather massive revisions re: Movement, Attacks of Opportunity, LOS, Reinforcements, etc to bring it up to the most remedial level of basic tactical gameplay, but once that's done, the 2nd edition is a marked improvement on the first.  Runewars + conversion kit gives a perfectly acceptable array of characters to choose from.  Happy with the renewed stress on campaign gameplay, and happy to continue paying for incremental additions, even if I wish the good ol' dungeon delving was still around.

Almost played my way through one full campaign. Lots of fun with tactical conflict and goals between the heros and overlord. Some scenarios seem to be favoured for one group or the other. Sometimes seems to swing quite eradically in terms of who (heros or overlord) is leading / winning at a given point. Roughly at a 50-50 split between hero and overlord wins. Sometimes a bit long for what it does. Will be interesting to try the coop version.

Takes a good couple hours to read through all the cards so you can strategize as either a hero or DM, but once at least one person does this, the rest goes smoothly. It's easy to teach others if at least one person is the instant reference manual since, without this, the game slows to a crawl with constant rule-checking and frustrated players that didn't know what all their choices were.

Once you get your party through one or two quests though it's tons of fun to try out different classes on single quests under the advanced and expert play variants. Playing a full campaign is a big investment of time, but it's absolutely worth it. The characters are fun to level and the item shop adds an extra dose of difference in each playthrough.

With plenty of classes to switch around, this game guarantees at least  100 hours of gameplay or more before you start wanting to enter the expansions, and those multiply the gameplay even more. Plenty of bang for your buck here.

I have never played Descent (first edition) but I really enjoy playing Descent 2.0. The balance of strategy and light role playing makes this game a ton of fun. The rules and game mechanics are easy to understand but there is depth in the strategy that greatly increases replayability. The core box includes over a dozen scenarios that can be combine into a campaign that allows players to level their characters and provide bonuses for winning the scenario. New players will definitely want to download the updated rules and errata from FFG. Several of the scenarios have game breaking flaws without the updates.

"Descent 2.0" as a whole (expansions included) is awesome. FFG is always producing new content for the game and so far each expansion has brought new mechanics and has been worth the price. The cooperative variant that was recently released was a welcome edition. The owner of Descent generally gets stuck as the Overlord. It was nice to get to play a hero.

Great components. The miniatures are really cool and I've decided to paint them to added visual appeal. Would be great to have a second set of dice though, so that both the Heroes and the Overlord can have their own set of dice. It always seems to be a search for a particular die and on which side of the table they are.

Playing as Overlord is quite fun, being able to choose your monster composition and figuring out how to defeat those pesky heroes trying to ruin your Evil day. The Overlord cards are okey, but some feel a bit lackluster.

Playing as Hero is definitely fun, and I think I enjoy that the most. Strategising with your fellow heroes and complementing each other to defeat the bad guy Overlord feels rewarding to me. I think it was a smart design choise to have Hero card decoupled from hero class, increasing the variety in the game.

A caveat for some players, it the feeling of powerlessness in certain situations. For example playing a hero that the overlord keeps focus firing on and knocking you out every turn. Or when the opposing team has such a advantageous board position that it seems like you'll be unable to achieve the objective of a scenario.

The scenario based gameplay is really the strong suit of this game. The game is not about killing each other. But fighting it often required to gain ground etc.

Campaign rules are really cool from the Hero standpoint. Being able to collect all new shiney items and new abilities is really compelling. As the Overlord of a campaign, it does feel a bit lackluster to maybe get a new card when your opposition gets all kinds of cool and nifty stuff. Not that it feels imbalanced to me, but rather less shiny and compelling. Its also quite the downtime for the overlord while the heroes bicker of which items to keep and sell or buy, and which ability they want to take next.

This appears to be the second coming of a game that I wanted to play a lot of in my youth but I was never able to get to the table (HeroQuest). I have always been interested in this fantasy dungeon theme and spent countless hours in games like the Diablo series. While probably only playing HeroQuest once or twice as a kid, this was one of the first games that I saw when I was getting in to the hobby that I truly wanted to get. It also looked to be a step up from HeroQuest and was something that I could really get in to with a group in a campaign.

Well... I have only played it once (July 2013) and, while it was good to get that under my belt as I'm more familiar with the mechanics, it seems to be relegated to collect dust in my collection... the same way its predecessor had.

It is unfortunate because I feel that the game itself (at this point) is mechanically solid and is something that I would really enjoy. The problem is that, after being able to play it at all, it would benefit from people that like to role play a bit or get more vocal during the game (myself included). The introduction of Imperial Assault (a more favorable theme to many it seems) would appear to have put the final nail in the coffin for this game but, for some reason, I don't think that I'll be parting with it any time soon.

I liked Descent a lot to begin with but it just kept rubbing me up the wrong way. Whether I was the overlord or the heroes I had mostly negative experiences because of the pain that gets inflicted on the pathetic "heroes" at the hands of the OL (and I don't think it's fun to play the OL). When playing the campaign a single loss for the heroes ends up spiraling out of control as the OL can basically just curb-stomp them from then on by choosing an unfavourable match up for the next game. In our games most of the time the heroes began a quest on fire or poisoned or some such due to adventure cards that got resolved beforehand!

Since so many games ended in sourness due to woeful lack of balance in the quests and feelings of frustration and anger among all the players I decided to get rid of this. I do regret not having it a little but at least I save tons of valuable shelf space since I don't have to buy the expansions now! I do long for a dungeon crawler but this didn't do it for me.

I absolutely love this game. The mechanic is so easy to learn and teach. It's almost like an RPG, but without the roleplaying bit.

However, the objectives is kinda odd for a dungeon crawling game. Sometimes the best possible strategy is to ignore all the monsters as best you can.

Really good fantasy quest experience. Soooo much playtime coming out of this box, granting huge replayability. I like the fact an encounter can be played under an hour, to me this opens up for a broader player audience. I exclusively play the Overlord and I am having a blast at it. I think a 9 rate is the best I can give, since there are balance issues in this game that prevents the game from being perfect.

Early thoughts:

[b]The +3 Vorpal Sword:[/b]

1. This feels like a greatest hits album - the game hits all the right notes, beats, and rhythms. Every aspect of the design is a classic of its type, yet the package is a thoroughly modern enterprise.

2. Terrific rulebook.

3. A gargantuan improvement over the 1st edition.

4. The Quest and campaign system is brilliant - why no one has implemented something quite like this before, in a *mainstream* boardgame product, is a complete mystery to me.

5. Combat resolution system is like a meld of [b]Doom[/b] and [b]Heroquest[/b]. One roll of the bones gives you hits [i]and[/i] range; the defender then rolls his dice hoping for shields - it's a good, solid system - which I like.

6. Excellent dice. Funky with particular runes for surges and whatnot, these dice always beat regular D6s in the cool contest.

7. Descent 2nd edition takes all the good stuff from [b]Mansions of Madness[/b], and then retools it for a dungeon setting, removing the fiddly search cards (which I like in that game), and a cartload of other faff. What you're left with is a lean, well-lubricated iron golem of a dungeon game. All the miniatures and tokens and stuff that'd be hidden in [b]Mansions of Madness[/b], are viewable straight from the start of the scenario here. There's zero hidden information from the delver players. The upshot of this is that the game's fast playing and snappy.

8. The experience system is really neat, introducing a deck-building aspect to the Keeper's game, amongst other elements. Meaning he can save up XP to buy traps to trick his Keeper deck out with, using the exact same deck as the campaign progresses, but now it's personalised to you, hard-nosed ex-D&D Dungeon Master. This is one of the superior fulcrums of this design. The hero players can buy equipment and skills between encounters, as you might expect - it's all so very RPG-lite, but extremely loveable. 

9. Excellent consistent artwork on everything. No cutesy poo bollocks that is found in [b]Dungeon Lords[/b].

10. I particularly like the map tiles. Each one has wilderness pictured on one side, and a torchlit dungeon setting on the flipside. FFG realise, as good DMs should, that wilderness adventures make a nice change from dungeon bashing - even if it's only really different from an aesthetic POV.


[b]The Gelatinous Cube:[/b]

1. I'm not much keen on the sculpts of the miniatures or in the choice of creatures featured. Appears that in the interests of being original and quirky, the creators have included a clutch of odd-ball monsters. I do applaud giant spiders and goblins, obviously.

2. Hate the box art displayed on the edges of the game - viewable mainly when the game's sat on a shelf in your office.

3. An extra example or two regarding the creation of monster groups and campaigns would have been perfect. I 'get' the rules, but it took 2-3 readings for this aspect to bed down in my brain.

4. No *real* magic system.

5. The flavour introduction text for the quests is pretty craptastic.


NOTE: replaced 95% of the models with painted alternatives.

Played it a lot after initial purchase, finished 3 campaigns fairly quickly, then didn't get played for a long time.  So probably got 100 hours or more out the the game but then decided to sell.

Everything the combat in Dungeons and Dragons games should be if you forgo the role-playing. Absolutely fantastic feeling to the progression as you complete quests. Almost every single encounter is won by the skin of your teeth no matter which side wins. There are always stories to be told after the box is packed up for the night. Just really well made and compelling to play.

Decent dungeon crawling game. Don't see the holy grail, that everyone is talking about.

The game has some issues, that can ruin gameplay. Very unbalanced quests. One side always ends up crushing the other. Have yet to see a close game(After 8 plays).

I also dislike the K.O system. When revived you roll red dice and the number of hearts symbols on those dice, show how much health, you recover, but once you've been K.O once, you are likely to go down again and again. There is a snowball effect here.

RATING: 8
This is a very good dungeon crawl, but I have to rate it lower than the 1st edition.  Although it took a long time to play a 1st edition scenario, I really enjoyed the epic feel, the growth of characters, and the uniqueness of each character.  By simplifying the rules and eliminating many of the choices, this game becomesa bit too similar to all of the other move next to a monster and just attack dungeon crawls.  I liked the strategy, variety, and complexity of the first edition and this one is not quite as interesting. The Overlord deck is too limited.  I really hate the way players "die" - almost no penalty, but then they are so weak they just keep dying over and over again which is also boring.

Really good, what I hoped Wrath of Ashardalon would be.

edit - Rating revised down. The game rather than feeling like a quest or adventure seems to rapidly descend into a pure strategy game where the main battle is trying to get down narrow corridors which are blocked with oversized minions. I'm finding it quickly becoming tedious. So many big monsters, such narrow corridors.

I've played this with the app and it was very enjoyable. Beautiful, simple to learn, nothing too complex about basic play, and the app adds some impartial randomness. It isn't a very cruel DM and that is just fine. Almost every turn is about how to best combine our team to reach the maximum outcome. Some turns will give you freedom and it's fine if one, sometimes two heroes act alone. So many expansions! So many many expansions. Could do with a bit of 3d decor sometimes instead of enemies. Enemies are varied in the actions and appearances, scenarios are just long enough, and the app does a great job of tracking things for you, guiding you along so you can feel more immersed.

RATING: 8
This is really fun.  I never played the first edition, but I've genuinely enjoyed the second edition gameplay.  Fast paced and entertaining.

I will mention that I play the overlord, and as the overlord my opinion is that you need to be able to take some enjoyment from watching the plans of the players develop.  The overlord game is much less involving and much simpler than the game run by the players.  This game is best if the players are truly cooperative and you don't have a situation where one guy is running "boss."  Our group is 2 players using 4 characters total (to experience as much of the game as possible) with me as overlord.  The two guys really cooperate together formulating plans and it's interesting to me to watch how they react to the wrenches I throw in their plans.  

In the wrong group, there could be a real hesitancy on the part of some people to take the role of the overlord, and I knock a full point off my rating for that.  If you have someone who would genuinely enjoy that role, this rating could be considered a 9.

Descent second edition beats the D&D Castle Ravenloft board game, and its expatiations, in map intricacy and tiles.
It loses out in combat with its hard 1/6 miss chance on every attack role no mater what and its inability to do random dungeons. Tack on its need for a GM (the overlord) and the abysmally easy scenarios and you get a mild game that is colorful but has many other games that do what it dose but better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.6
This game is so highly rated because it is EPIC. Doing a campaign in Descent can lead you down a very epic line of stories and conquests. Dungeon crawling at its finest, but while other games can pull off epicness, Descent pulls it off with mechanics that work. Combat makes sense, adding new skills and weapons makes sense. Plus, with the quest vault you can turn this game into a game SYSTEM. It could never end if you wanted it to be that way. I'll add expansions eventually, but I just finished painting all the minis for my copy. Definite 9!

The gameplay is ok. The game plays smooth and quick. 

I really enjoy how they handled the skill system. It adds more tactical gameplay. They also did away with the town teleporting from 1st ed, which is good because now the action isn't interrupted by shopping sprees. 

The main issue lies with the scenario's. Some favour the Overlord and others the heroes. A lot scenario's are basically races to be the first to claim an objective and score it. The diversity in tasks and objectives for each scenario is a good thing. But it lacks the how to overcome monsters in a tactical fun and engaging way, they seem to be just roadblocks. 

Is it fun to play ? It is. Selecting skills to use, discussing strategy, finding loot and buying upgrades never get old. The scenario tells a story so it's no more kill all monsters in the dungeon now like in the first edition. 

I played through one campaign and found it very unbalanced with a lot of scenario's that favored the Overlord and even some impossible scenario's for the heroes. I like challenge but if it's too easy for the Overlord it isn't fun for anyone. Especially act 2 wasn't fun to play through. This tells me the game campaign was very badly playtested.

Played first when launched a few years ago and after several plays, started to hate the imbalance of scenarios. 

Was almost deciding to sell it, when they announced the app Road to Legend, which broght me back to it, and how much the game changed since I stopped. The new expansions fixed many of the problems I had with balance, and now, with the introduction of the app I can play this game with different game modes that suits my current mood.

1 vs Many style, full coop campaign style, one shot delve style, not to mention stuff created by this community...

Oh FFG, what did you do. Yeah, Descent had some clunky rules, but in tidying them up they managed to suck all the fun out of it too. There's a few things that are better, especially the miniatures, but so many things are worse I don't even know where to begin. In fact, it's such a different game to Descent they could have released this as a companion to it rather than a replacement.
I'm sad to say I'll be returning to Road to Legend which is far superior.

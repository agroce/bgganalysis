El antecesor de ASL. Mi primer wargame, que me pareció fabuloso en su momento, pero cuyas reglas no resisten un análisis profundo, resultando poco verosímiles. Superado por TANK LEADER y PANZERGRENADIER. Se espera una versión actualizada y mejorada con PANZERBLITZ II HILL OF DEATH

Found it at a Flea Market w/ Luftwaffe (Avalon Hill Games) 15$ for both, PL was New, tokens weren't even punched from the boards. Luftwaffe was missing its literature :(    FUN Game! My 1st War Strategy game, and I'm enjoying it greatly as a highly replayable strategy game!

Now all I want is PanzerBlitz AND Panzer Leader 1940 (expansion) Plus all the other freakin' Avalon Hill games I've bought in the last month! ;)

Game is complete. All counters present. It is likely unplayed as, although the unit counters have been punched from their frames, most are still attached in rows of 2-5. Boards are immaculate, rules and scenarios fine. Unfortunately, about half of the American markers were printed a little off of center, so parts of the data on the counters may be pinched off. Box shows some shelf wear, and all corners on top and bottom of box have been split and repaired with tape.

A natural follow-on to PB, and generally improved, though the glare hi-gloss white map is an eyesore.  Fortunately, avid PB/PZ fans have redone the maps and offer these very pretty upgrades for free on the net.  Download, print out, and glue on top of the iceberg shining boards, and you have a real verdant looking european countryside instead.  More fun if you snagged the AH paratroop and France 1940 variants.

Fond memories of this one. The Western Front followup to Panzerblitz, this game cleaned up and expanded on the former's rules and offered airstrikes, naval bomardment, and amphibious landings to the mix.

This is a game on par with ASL.  Fighting those big tanks in WWII is great fun and gives you a real appreciate for the quality of the german tanks in the 40s.

This has considerable "sentimental" value as the first wargame I bought (around 1977) and played, and I played it a LOT with my friends, so my rating is colored by that.  For a long time it was a game I kept coming back to for a favorite topic because of it's easy of play and wide appeal.  It is fairly easy to design your own scenarios that are both historically based or just point system based.  The system also lends itself fairly well to tinkering with the rules and holds up well for engagement ranging from battalion to (smaller) division sized (as long as you don't have to much indirect fire artillery).  It's problems are many, however, and that is why it does not rate higher.  Most of the mechanics are not "realistic" and the ratings on many of the unit types are at best suspect and in some cases plain dumb.

Possibly the worst issue is that the attack ratings on the infantry units are based on their "anti-tank" ability, which is just absurd.  Also, many of the artillery and assault gun units you would think would have good attack ratings against infantry are instead rated for their ability to attack tanks, making them weak or even useless in their intended role.  Coming up with some dual attack ratings for each of the units (and fixing the town defense rules) would improve the game considerably.

On the plus side, it delivers what it advertises in terms of a tank warfare game, and after several people made available new maps, additional unit types and a host of well designed scenarios it is still worth a look if you are into tactical level tank games.

For some reason it was always far easier to find an opponent for this than, say, the FAR better Tank Leader system, and the replay value for well designed scenarios is outstanding.  Also the "Boardgamer" magazine and "Boardgamer's Panzer Leader Special Issue" (published by Bruce Monnin), and the excellent counters and new maps created by Ward McBurney, add many additional good scenarios and flavor to the game.

Carefully scenario selection, along with a few house rules (and the many official rule clarifications), give this game good play value, but unless you are really interested in the topic and don't mind working with the rules really there is no reason to look for this antique given there have been several decent alternatives on this topic published since then.

This is the game that started it all for me.  

Siren song from a shelf at a local bookstore.  Arcane and powerful symbols and graphics that I intuitively understood took the game of Army men to a whole new level.

I was hooked. Totally freakin hooked. Dragged all the local kids to play this, and for a time they  were hooked too, but where I went on in the hobby to new and more amazing  heights the others were like units in this game, many of them became casualties in the boardgaming hobby...

Still, here is a wargame that stands tall in the annuals of the hobby. I don't care that  some aspects of the simulation are wrong for those in the hardcore know.  Dunnigan just nailed it for putting a complex group of things into a set of rules and factors to bring about a highly varied tactical wargame toybox, even if it wasn't "perfect" by today's standards it still rocks for me.

Solidly engaging.

Endless variation, easy to create one's own scenarios, low bookkeeping, typically nice AH production, the combined arms dance, all there. And who doesn't like trying to hold out against the King Tigers crawling up Elsenborn Ridge?

This is less "gamey" than PanzerBlitz, which is the progenitor, yet I preferred the situations these gamey aspects presented (specifically the PB delay objective scenarios), as well as the larger scale of the Eastern Front. Most seem to prefer PL as being a bit more realistic.

Quite possibly the most popular and most played World War II platoon-level game ever made--and I include PANZERBLITZ in this.  While the state of the art in game design has passed this title by, this does mean this game does not still have its attractions in terms of historicity and competitive challenge.  Requires chess-like precision to play and is very unforgiving.  Great entry game for neophyte wargamers as it's still relatively easy to picture what is happening on the gameboard and relate the action to what one already knows (from the Hollywood war movies, if nothing else!).

Old school cardboardy goodness here.  I bought this when I was a fat little fourteen year old.  I never got to play it  as much as I wanted to since my friends were not wargamers (and the rules confused me on the LOS). It's still the first 'old' game on my shelf that I want to play.  I loved the simple art on the counters and felt like the pieces were really tanks instead of symbols. 

 Note: Today I still really like this wargame.  I think by todays standards of complexity it ranks as a beer and pretzels wargame with a gritty, realistic feel.  It's a great step up from something like Memoir 44 because it keeps the tactical scale and hexes but offers more types of units and tanks.  I'm not a big fan of the 'I go, you go' turn sequence in wargames but Panzer Leader has opportunity fire rules that spice things up a bit during your opponents turn.  It's a clean and simple set of rules and comes with twenty scenarios, many of which can be played very quickly.  All of that and a retro wargame look and feel make the game a winner in my book.  As old as it is, the large, clear unit counters look better to my eye than many of the more graphic and fancy counters of today.  It's cheap on ebay and it's a true piece of wargaming history that is still fun to play.  It also has the best box artwork ever.  I'm keeping and playing my copy.

My first tactical level game and 3rd ever game after Russian Campaign and African Campaign (both in Jedko versions).    Played PL a lot in late 1970s, fond memories.  As with most tactical games systems "realism" and scenarios historicity are debatable.  Best played with AIW style morale rules to prevent automatic "rally" (becoming un-disrupted).  Also recall counter-intuitive indirect fire rules ... the more units stacked in the target hex the lesser the effect of IF.

All said was fun!  Now teaching my 8yo son.

Since picking it up again, found the rules a bit lacking under certain circumstances.  So for those cases, we fell back on common sense or what we had done in other wargames. May have to find the rule book that has an appendix to help out in those cases.

Gave it a 7 because that's what it deserves at least, but I could never get this to the table with my group. A bit too complex maybe, even though they did play squad leader occasionally. I guess I enjoyed the grand strategy like Third Riech and War and Peace more than these type games.

Panzerblitz moves west.  A few improvements to the original, but still suffered from the same major problems:  using transport to block roads and seize objectives, "dispersed" as a combat outcome=that doesn't really translate into any viable result at this scale.  Game also changed the scale, making Panzerblitz counters almost unusable.  Did introduce airpower though.  Just not all that, especially to someone who has been gamin miniatures.

RATING: 7
A true classic.    This game was a direct progression from "Panzer Blitz" and was a better and more complex game...  Just as that can be said of "The Arab Israeli Wars" and this game.  All three are must haves for true boardgame-wargame-geeks!

A snap to teach to any wargamer with more than two boardgames under their belt.  Can be used for a host of scnerios and with the converted values to use the system from "The Arab Israeli Wars" (the next and last game in this series) this game is a solid 9+

A game I want to like, but it falls short of the mark. Promotes unrealistic strategies and fails to properly quantify the units represented in the game.

Many fond memories of this game. This and PanzerBlitz occupied many many hours of time in High School that could have been put to better use, but what the hell. Our game club came up with so many home brewed scenarios we could have published a book. The best ones were a combo-PL/PB game with 36 mapboards and using counters from both games to form as massive 3-way battle. The othe fun game was a play on the movie Kelly's Heroes.

The follow-on to Panzerblitz, Panzer Leader uses pretty much the same system but with a few refinements.  Panzerblitz deals with the Eastern Front (mostly 1943-45); Panzer Leader deals with the Western Front (1944-45).  More realistic than its predecessor, Panzer Leader is a fun game.

A true classic. A vast improvement from the PanzerBlitz game (with 'spotting' allowed when a platoon of tanks fire from a woodline) and opportunity fire. For its day, a remarkable piece of production: solid boards, nice counters, outstanding rulebook. Sure, the IGO-UGO play sequence seems now to be a bit dated, but again, for one's money, you got a look of fun and play out of this game. There will be always be a soft spot in my heart for this game, and that is why, though I don't actually break it out and play it, I will always keep it as part of my collection.

A very good tactical warfare game that replays scenarios from the Western Front of WW2 post D-DAY.  It is strong on the ground war, but the strategic war is not represented at all and the air war rules are very weak.

Well, it was a considerable improvement on Panzerblitz. Not a very insightful look at platoon level WW2 combat by today's standards. The infantry is still pretty much a waste,as the Panzers roll. I always liked the system used in Panzer Command for this scale, although it's more work. 

But I still very clearly remember getting this for Christmas in the '70s as a kid, and how excited I was. I played this a ton back then. Plenty of memorable fights for Grancelles.

A classic. The first game that sucked me right into this obsession that is still going strong. I bought this in Hamleys toy store on my 10th or 11th birthday. Spent hours and hours messing about with it.
Having played again as an adult I see a few problems in the rulebook. The rules for firing into towns/armored targets are hopelessly confused but there are some good ideas to sort them out here on BGG. 
I still love this game. I would play it every other game if only my ftf opponent liked it too. He doesn't unfortunately. The counters are probably my favorites ever and the box art is awesome. My ambition is collect 3 sets and play the macro game someday.

Panzerblitz improved and in France, 1944.  The main improvement was in the concept of opportunity fire.  Now a unit could no longer run and hide from one hex to the next, all along showing the enemy his tail why he did it.  This took the "bush" out of "Panzerbush."  Great scenarios, great game.

RATING: 8
So it's dated and so it's prone to unrealistic tactics and so it's scenarios are unbalanced; this is a terrific game of tactical armor warfare. Squad Leader is better in almost every way but also so much harder to learn.  Components are far superior to what SPI was delivering and all the 'upgrades' that SPI attempted never made for better games.  Panzerblitz and Panzer Leader are the games to use to bring worthy wargamers into the WW II tactical arena.

An excellent game when it first appeared, but I gave up playing it without a second thought upon learning Advanced Squad Leader. I recently played it again for the first time in many years, and discovered that it was still a lot of fun! It has some serious lapses in realism (concentrating units to minimize damage from artillery bombardments; and tanks with heavy armor-piercing weapons being the best units to attack and defend towns), but the rules are relatively simple and the games move along at a fast pace. A classic game that's still worth an occasional play. I suspect that, back in the good old days when Panzer Leader WAS the ultimate WWII tactical game, the historical problems limited my enjoyment of it... all the years that it sat neglected on the shelf have unexpectedly made it much more fun to play!

PANZER LEADER defines war strategy sims in a board game format covering the Western Front 1944-45.   An amazing war game strategy.   Kudos to Jim Dunnigan, George Bradford, and Alan Arvold for their complete dedication and diligence in bringing this board game of armored combat during World War II.

My first Avalon Hill game, probably a bit too deep for a couple of 8th grade kids. This game focused on armor and artillery.

Panzer Leader is one of the best selling wargames of all time. A WWII West Front version of the even better selling, East Front based, PanzerBlitz. The games depict tactical combined arms combat at the platoon level (mostly). Components were ahead of their time: oversized counters with silhouette graphics of the vehicles they represented, 'geomorphic' map boards that could be laid side by side or end to end to form larger game surfaces. The rules were complex for the day, and included historical analysis to back up concepts in the game.
I quit counting at 12 copies. PL & PB are two of my 'go to' games, if I feel like playing something and I just want to have fun. Sure I know the system is dated and artificial and there are better games on this subject and scale, I just don't care.

Wonderful job of abstracting WWII armored warfare to an easily-learned and playable level.  Almost too simplified in some ways, but the fun factor makes up for that.

RATING: 10
This one goes to "11".  After 31 years, still the best overall in my opinion. It's gameplay is pure gold, the realism is at a great level, and the scenarios are all wonderful and eminantly replayable. Multiplayer, blind, and "overlord"-like megamaps all work well. Try this and then Arab-Israeli Wars. Can be had dirt cheap on e-bay. It's a real wargame, but with elegant streamlines rules that are easy to remember. Grandad Panzerblitz is inferior in gameplay and realism, but it has Russian tanks which can be ported over to the PL system ... It's also a thing of beauty, at least to the true wargamer. If Squad Leader is a bit much for your poor brain, this is what you want!  I have played this wargame more than all of the others combined.

My first true wargame. I bought my first copy at 16. I know there are a lot of critics who say it's unrealistic due to such things as tanks never breakdown or, units move the same no matter what time of year it is. The rules are some what of a pain due to the fact that you have to jump around a bit to get the picture. If you can get over these drawbacks, it is fantastic for fighting out historical or made up encounters. I own about 10 copies of the game to play macro games.

Although I never officially "owned" this game, my buddy did, while I had PanzerBlitz and we would exchange each other's games. We would adapt the Panzer Leader rules to PanzerBlitz, so that is why I'm including this game as well. I enjoyed playing this game with my friend, sometimes we played the scenarios and other times we would make up our own scenarios. Won or lost, I still had fun. The combined maps from both games [7], doing the all nighters were some of the most fun. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
For clarity, this has one of the best rules sets I've ever come across in a tactical game. Despite various abstractions, this would still serve as an excellent introduction to tactical game concepts. The breadth of scenarios for a single package is impressive, most every major action in the west 44/45 is represented, D-day to inside Germany. DYO is also there. I suppose there might be better company/platoon level systems out there today, but they'll crush you in cost if you want all the western front. Great addition for those interested in the subject and scale, but not the high detail level and cost.

This is the west front version of Panzerblitz. Has most of the same rules and identical counter design.
Geomorphic maps that can be rearranged to create different terrain. Ranged fire. Line of sight. Squad Leader one step up the organizational level.
I actually liked this better than Panzerblitz, probably because it had Americans and Brits instead of Russians.
Played it a lot in the old days but almost never now. Not a very good game for solitare, and a little tougher than Squad Leader for the beginner. But a true classic to me. Strangely I believe most gamers view Panzerblitz as a classic, but not this game! To each his own.

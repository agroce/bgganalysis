Decent two player game with some interesting mechanics.

+Provides decent strategic depth.
+Sets up and plays quickly.

=Pasted-on theme.

-Rules are somewhat lacking (revised edition).
-Starting with VPs and then losing them through the game seems a bit wonky.
-No luck mitigation for rolling low.  Rolling higher is still better.
-Seems to be a balance issue with the Gladiator characters.

RATING: 8.66
A great little 2 player that requires initial investment to get used to card abilities. It's well worth that investment, underneath that initial complexity is a lot of fun based around coming up with clever card combinations on the fly. The game can be quick if someone gets a very powerful combo early on, but balanced matches are worth suffering the quick ones.

It's a fast and fun 2-player game, but the fact that some cards are heavily unbalanced (specially the Forum) makes this only to work with equally skilled players. When you're playing against unexperienced players they have no chance on winning, and probably won't enjoy the game.
I hope this will change with the upcoming Rome II.

Sin gran despliegue de medios te da que pensar, te entretiene y te hace pasar unos ratos realmente agradables. Es posible que cree serias adicciones, pues cada partida es totalmente distinta. De lo más recomendable y excepcional en su relación calidad de material, entretenimiento y precio.

RATING: 4
1st plays: I happened across a free copy of this game and I feel like I got the raw end of the deal.  The symbols on the cards make the game take longer than they should, words would have been better (Roma 2 has them), and the dice actions make the game feel very random.  There is a spiritual precursor here to Castles of Burgundy, with dice limiting your actions but not defining them.  Castles does this mechanic so much better.  The bleeding VP every turn leaves a bad taste in the mouth, because the game feels inevitably drawn towards losing, and the game isn't so much about winning as it is about not losing.  Yet, playing the game feels like a loss.

We had fun making fun of the game though.

Only a few plays, so not a solid opinion, but:

Nice, light two player game. Lots of cards that each have specific abilities sort of like Jambo or maybe Blue Moon but abilities seem easier to grasp in this case. I guess the big question is whether the Forums are too powerful and to that I'd probably say no but it does seem to take too long to be able to counter them once your opponent gets them in place. It seems like when one player gets their forum(s) working the other has to get at least one down quickly to keep in the victory point race. And once the victory point production is underway the game can be over in a couple turns which is generally too quick to try to destroy your opponents Forum. Still, there are many routes to victory in this game so this is probably one of those games that will require quite a few plays to really see what the various strategies are. Luckily it's quick enough that you can play a few games in a sitting.

A very cool design, with nice mechanics and good interaction. Sure, luck plays a significant role in Roma, but there are ways to mitigate it (except for battles). The back-and-forth can be spectacular, as there is always a chance to come back and score a surprising victory (thanks to the Mercator, for example). One of the best 2-player games I've tried so far.

I prefer this to the expansion as it stands, but using them together works very well. We have 2 separate draw decks and start with 2 cards each from each set and when you draw cards you can choose which deck to draw from. This seems to work better than one against the other. The other option is putting the cards in sleeves as the backs are different colours.

{2 plays} So far, I like it.  Yes, I understand there may be a card balance issue, but it hasn't come up yet for us - that is to say, we haven't tried to take advantage of it, nor do we want to... 'cause we like the game.  But I get that it's there, and that's too bad, because I'm really taken with the whole dice allocation thing.  And it's neat to find cool card combos... and the multiple victory conditions are cool, too.  Having said that, I feel like... sadly, this one will wane... and I can't quite pinpoint why, other than to say that as fun as it for now, it just seems to lack that... something.  Especially when there are MANY good 2-player games out there.

Okay, now *that*? That was fun. Die rolling, intrigue, always wondering what's coming next... seems like it's going to be an excellent and much-played game.

Thank goodness for the Geek and fan-supplied quick-references, though.

UPDATE: After getting my nickel, I hardly need to refer to the reference any more. The icons are less inscrutable, and I remember what most cards do in any case. It's pretty hard to climb out of a double-forum hole, though.

Rating modified slightly after latest plays.  One game and a succession of 1s and 2s rolled (with no cards on those numbers) led to a very quick loss of VPs and defeat.  Other plays much better.  The Forum has had the most influence on the other games.  Left feeling that there ought to be more opportunities to attack your opponents and that these ought to be restricted depending on card oppositions.  Still a good game and happy to play again.  One of the best of the new Queen games.

RATING: 7
Fun and innnovative dice/card management game that seems a tad under-developped to me. I agree that forums seem a bit overpowered, and that it is extremely difficult to win when coming from behind. The "half-from-opponent-when-behind" forum variant strikes me as an improvement. The spy and thief should have been included in the game (and the rules could have stated the spyless, thiefless variant). Rules are incomplete for the sake of brevity in English and are simply atrocious in French. With some further tweaking, could easily go up.

Rated after two plays; rating may well go up (and playing time down) with increased familiarity with the cards.

After 30+ games it remains a "7" beacuse of the game's regrettable tendency to produce a no-contest every couple of games or so:- a game in which one player gets loads of points and the other struggles to keep the ones they started with. Other than that, a very enjoyable game.

[url=http://ballearicus.blogspot.com/2007/11/roma.html]Roma[/url] es un juego de cartas y dados. Este diseño le da un nivel de azar medio/alto, pero con una buena  gestión de la mano y la saber donde colocar los dados, hace que este factor se minimice. Esto hace de Roma un juego mas táctico que estratégico.Es difícil encontrar un juego para 2 jugadores de cartas que sea divertido. Hay interacción continua y tensión, sus estrategias diversas y variadas hacen de que cada partida sea distinta. Su duración variable debido a las condiciones de finalización del juego, puede hacer que sea excesivamente largo para lo que ofrece, me hubiese gustado que fuese mas corto.

Roma no está entre mis juegos favoritos, pero de los juegos de cartas que tengo uno de los que más me gusta. Me gusta echar una partida de vez en cuando.

This is one of my wife and I's favorite light 2-player games.  It's compact but has just enough extra bits to pull it above feeling like just a card game.  I want to give it a 9, but I have to deduct a full point for the simple fact that sometimes you feel more like the cards are playing you instead of you playing the cards.  Or in other words, the luck of the draw is high here.

UPDATE:  Went ahead a gave it a 9.  Years later, and we still play it.  It is true that mostly just have to play the cards you get, but how well you play them usually sways the game, even if you do just plain get screwed occasionally.  It's short enough that you can just play another game of it.

The game just doesn't do it for me.  I can see that it would be interesting, and where it can get good...but it really left me with a "this is it" feeling. I didn't feel it would be worth my time to explore. Traded.

Update: Upon playing more of Feld's games, I have an interest in this one again.

Update #2: Okay, got the new version where you can read the cards.  HUGE difference.  Also, the person I played against is a more in-tune game player.  I like the decisions to be made in this ebb and flow game.  I bump from a 3 to a 7.  It's definately a Feld.

A fun quick 2 player game.  Yes, sometimes it ends fast.  But you never know when that's going to be the case.  Sometimes it goes back and forth.

If it ends quick, set 'em up and play again!  This is a good game to play a best 2 out of 3 or more.  

One caveat--after playing this a few times, it seemed to me that the player who goes first gets a lasting initiative.  I tracked the next 100 games I played, and the player who went first won 70 of them.  I've played about 70 games since then giving an extra VP at start to the player who goes 2nd, and the results have been pretty close to 50-50.

Very fun two player game, my only complaint is how fast it goes. This is definitely a niche game, but an excellent choice when you want something that plays fast and is easy to teach/learn. Menzel's art with Feld's mechanics make for a beautiful game that is slightly bested by Arena: Roma II.

Can't make my mind up with this one - on the surface it's an interesting filler, and as such I've had some great games. But sometimes it turns into a long game and then the enjoyment wanes a bit ... so it's currently an '8' but probably higher in some circumstances and lower in others!

Helps when both players know all the cards.

Solid two player game. I even got my teenage son to play this and he is very hard to get playing anything at all! Yes you can get smashed due to the luck of draw but we found the comebacks were often possible from seemingly lost positions. If it does end too quickly then just, play again.

Wow, I missed out on this gem.  Now that I've finally gotten around to trying it I'm kicking myself for all the time I wasted playing Race for the Galaxy when I needed a quality 2 player game.

The combination of cards and dice create a system where I felt I always have options.  Sure there's luck but I have tools to manage it so my fate is, for the most part, in my hands.  The high dose of direct player interaction feels like a  breath of fresh air.  Other Euros should take notes.  Lately too many have become stagnant, multiplayer-solitaire affairs.  That just makes for games that make you feel bored and lonely.

Roma feels fresh, dynamic and most importantly fun.  One of the best 2 player games the Euro genre has to offer.

Ow, was this a painfully lame game!  I had lots of cards that boosted my defense but nothing worth defending.  Meanwhile, my opponent kept drawing all the victory point buildings, and I couldn't get my attacks coordinated (i.e. couldn't roll both a gladiator and a thingie that reduces the enemy's buildings) and couldn't roll high enough to dent his victory point generators.  The only good thing was that once my opponent put down his third forum (next to a basilica, of course) the end came quickly.  The only reason I'm not giving it a lower rating is that I would play it again to confirm that the supreme lameness wasn't a once-in-a-lifetime fluke.

RATING: 5.5
Fun, light game. Dice play a big part but not very luck based: it uses the assign-dice-to-corresponding-spots-you-control mechanic I'm fond of (similar to Kingsburg or Claustrophobia). Still though, it is fairly light so won't be a huge favorite, but it's fun and- most importantly for a filler-type game- plays fairly quickly.

Update 06/27/2015: First two plays in a few years. Not as good as I remember- games were over very quickly and seemed largely dependent on which cards you were able to get out. Very light strategy. Knocking from a 6.5 to a 5.5

Fairly light, but enjoyable game where players try to outmanouvre each other through card play to gain a limited amount of available victory points. Enough choices to be engaging, but not too deep. Some decisions are quite obvious upon the roll of the die to either cash in victory points or take cash, but the player that uses his characters and buildings most optimally will usually win.

My son enjoys it and we've played several times. I think we'll play it quite a bit for a while. But I don't really like it much. I'm not sure why, but I think it has to do with how lucky or unlucky I feel based on my card draws - it seems to me that with the dice dictating what cards I can activate, all of the strategy is in acquiring the best cards and then paying for them and hoping they activate. But acquiring the best cards is pretty random, even if you use a high-numbered die to increase your chances. 

I think the combination of random card draws and random activations with the dice is just too much. But it is a quick, easy game, and one that has tension from the get-go with the loss of VP's that happens from Turn 1. So for something easy to play at night before bedtime, I think we may end up playing this quite a bit. My opinion of it could improve. I don't think I'm likely to reduce my rating over time, but we'll see. For $5 it was good value.

Fun, light two-player battle game. There are some interesting card interactions (and I find the card + dice mechanic to be refreshing and novel), but occasionally the game degenerates into a punishing slugfest where the luck of the draw seems to overwhelm good planning.

An amusing game that mixes Feld's typical dice-allocation mechanic with the vicious "take that" flavor of card games like Innovation and Jambo. Cards are grossly unbalanced, and much of the game is spent trying to contain forces that are totally out of your control. If you're not a fan of arbitrary special powers and lots of chaos, stay away. If you like brutally attacking other players and tearing down their stuff, this game is for you.

I'm really unsure of what I think of this one.  We had some enjoyable games, but the card powers are a bit out of wack.  There are some very powerful cards (Centurio, Forums), and some total stinkers.  The highly variable game length and unpolished rules don't add to much to this either.  A potentially good game, unrealized.

The game can become pretty unbalanced, then drag out -- the Mercator is a particularly bad example. I also don't like the fact that the cards require you to refer to a player aid. But the game is so simple, and has so much interaction, that I can forgive it its flaws. UPDATED: 7 -> 6. So random. Initial card draw is huge. Dice rolls are huge. And it's not easy to balance.

UPDATE: I think Roma is OK - some interesting choices, a little unstable, but not bad - but the deal-killer is the iconography. Too many of the special powers were apparently too hard to convey with reasonable icons, so you are constantly looking stuff up on the reference sheet, which conveniently lists everything in random order. Eh, it probably wasn't worth it anyway. Have some curiosity about Roma II, since Herr Feld seems to have developed as a game designer with the decent Notre Dame and then the very nice In the Year of the Dragon.
---
Sort of a *very* light version of the Settlers Card Game. I like dice games, and this one seemed like it was good for a play or two ... nice special powers and such. Also seemed like it goes long for the interest level, and the special powers didn't seem too well balanced. I would play again, but it would only be a buy for me at ~$15; at the current MSRP of $25, too expensive.

Really fun two-player game once you can remember what all the cards do.  There's lots of back and forth action in this one, making the game very tense throughout.  Once in a while, very bad (or very good) rolling can result in an extremely lopsided, crappy game, but it's not enough to keep me from enjoying this one.

RATING: 9
Very clever mechanic of activating your cards and using the dice to get money to pay for cards or to draw more cards. Some killer combos of characters make it very difficult to get back in the game once you have fallen behind. Had a great game of this where it was to and fro for ages which has raised it in my estimations as you can see tactics of play change. I keep finding new combinations of cards that work really well together. 90 Plays.

RATING: 7
Fans of the Kosmos line of two player games will like this one. Roma is described as a "dice game" but it is in fact more similar to games like Magic and Blue Moon, where players devise clever card combinations to try to defeat their opponent's clever card combinations. Roma complements this mechanic nicely  by adding a positional element with the use of dice disks and a resource management/efficiency element with the use of money and VPs. Like the best of the Kosmos games, Roma offers a lot of depth and replayability for a game that is so easy to learn and quick to play.

Sprinkle in a Thief and A Spy (on the blank cards), temper the Mercator to only three coins per turn and give the second player and additional VP at the game start and the game is fixed.

Can be unbalanced if one player gets a good opening hand and can take an early lead. But, typically, it's pretty quick to play and those (unbalanced) occasions never last long. Plenty of options, sometimes an overwhelming number. Gains points for being so quick to set up and play, loses points for occasional fiddliness (having to look through the deck for particular cards) and requiring frequent reference to the card details when it hasn't been played for a while.

A fun two player game.  Takes some study of the characters and buildings to really know how to play. Multi-levels of game play with a good balance of strategy and luck. Depending on how you interpret the "cover card" rule this could be a very long game (maybe too long).

This game gets my goat!  It's terrific.  One problem, though ... the victory conditions are a bit anti-climatic, if you win by exhausting the victory chit pool.  House rule fix I've heard about is worse:  playing until the deck is exhausted--the leader will just rip through the deck with his rolls.

[i]Received this after winning the Queen Lancaster Games contest.[/i]

Rated 8 after one play. Slick little game! My wife really likes Lost Cities and Jaipur, and this two player card game scratches the same itch. Each player plays cards opposite one another, but Roma adds card effects that are triggered by dice. Take the card powers/combos of Magic the Gathering, add the Lost Cities "tug of war" of opposing cards, and it's my best hackneyed example of what Roma feels like.

The card effects adds an element of complexity. But once players get familiar with the cards, I'm curious to see what type of tactical options emerge.

Update: five plays over the course of three evenings, and this game has quickly become one of my wife's preferred games. So far, so good. Finding the combos between cards and actions is very enjoyable.

Update: Well, I guess I read my wife wrong on this one! After watching it sit on the shelf a while, I found out my wife was pretty ambivalent about this one. It's a fine game, but there are two player card games that I'm more excited to try.

This is a fun two-player game that I'm really liking right now.  I see the Babel, Battle Line, Magic, and Scarab Lords references, but not the Settlers Card Game ones.  In the three games I have played so far, I haven't found the forums to be overpowered.  But we did see a blowout with the Mercator, so we have imposed a limit on the amount of coinage able to be converted (6).  Would like to play this game some more.  I think I'm more taken with this one than with Scarab Lords.  After more plays, I don't think the Mercator necessarily is all that powerful, and I no longer like to use that "fix".  A military attack can be a very strong strategy.

RATING: 4
This game is unfortunately significantly flawed.  It holds the promise of a really fun, light, but varied game system, where you could try out lots of strategies.  However, the game is poorly balanced.  Each game we play, it seems, we feel we need to fine-tune the rules to try and get the balance right.  We finally gave up the game as irredeemably broken.  Fun, but broken.  If you fix the most egregious balance problems (e.g. capping the number of your opponents' victory points which Mercator lets you "purchase"), the game might yield one really fun game per 3 or 4 tries; the other games will either fizzle, or end abruptly in an unsatisfactory manner, leading you to want to tweak the rules once again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A surprisingly deep game for such a slim stack of cards. Tactical choice occurs not only in what cards to play, but which ones to activate with the dice rolls, and whether or not to use the number as is, or throw it towards more cards or more gold. If they ever come out with an expansion or other game in this line, it will probably top my wanted list.

High quality bits and pieces (although the cards could have been from better cardstock) doesn't hurt the game's value, either.

There is quite a bit of luck, but it didn't bother me. I like the disposition of the dice as a decision, which gives tension to where you place characters/buildings. I get the sense that a game could drag on for quite a while, which would become tedious. I wouldn't bother purchasing this, but I would be happy to play if an opponent suggested it.

RATING: N/A
Not a bad idea, honestly. Artwork is good, too. But the game completely fails to evoke fun and interesting thought. Throw dice, look at what you can do (sometimes nothing, sometimes a lot, sometimes something in between), destroy a card or building of your opponent, done. You have to be a bit skillful in how you manage the result of the dice, but in the end, the flow of the game is completely determined by them—and I hate that. Therefore this game is not a member of the Dice Done Right Club™. You can think of a perfect way to combat forums, merchants or centurios, but if the dice don't let you, tough luck. Oops, just got the crucial card in my plan destroyed by a lucky opponent. The game should appeal to people who like games where luck determines your course of action; otherwise, avoid. Eventually sold off, without a single shred of regret.

[b]Update[/b] After many years I revisited the rules of this game, and came to the conclusion that the above might in fact be a big bunch of baloney, written by a very green n00b. I've removed the rating for this game on the grounds of suspecting it [i]way[/i] too harsh; I'm also rescheduling another visit to ancient Rome.

We used to love it until we discovered San Juan, which is similar but really better (except it has no dice). Still, it's a nice little filler with an interesting use of dice.

Has become a bit stale because the only strategy that really works is to search the stack for a forum, build it and use it as soon as possible. The other options do not really work well.

EDIT: since the ARENA expansion, we have played it again quite a bit. The expansion enables a lot of diverse strategies, like destroying your opponent's cards, stealing points from them and so on. It has definitely become better again!

Nice historical theme and many nicely drawn cards. I'd like to like this game!
But it seems like an *incredibly* luck based and also unbalanced game based on reading the manual. Some cards seem too strong, others too weak. Particularly, the Mercator seems *much* too strong.
The game is way too luck based for my taste, it reminds me a lot of the "funny" game "roll x dice, whoever rolls the highest numbers wins"...

This is a preliminary rating before my first game. I feel confident enough to rate it already before even having played it because the flaws seem so obvious from reading the manual. But I reserve final rating for after having played it, of course.
I expect to not want to play this again after the first one or two games.

Brilliant medium-to-low-weight Euro by Stefan Feld. I love the dice allocation mechanism. Lots of surprisingly cool combos and depth. Plays quickly and smoothly. Underappreciated even by Feld fans! Roma doesn't have as many paths to victory as Arena: Roma II has, which I rate slightly higher, but this version is slightly less "in your face".

Fun two-player game -- has dice rolls, so elements of randomness. But a nice full deck of cards with special abilities makes the chaos fun. And there's something about this game that reminds me of another favorite, Hera & Zeus. UPDATE: The Mercator-focus of the game, out of the box, is a bit unbalanced, but from the following thread I have added the "Spy" and the "Thief" card, per the designer's own instruction, and that has improved Roma and kept it rated an 8 for me:

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/82272

Update: Having played this game numerous times over the past few months, I still think it's just as good as before, but I'm a bit Roma-fatigued, so simple downgrade to 7.

5/5/13: Having just played for the first time in years, I was reminded how fun this game is and now realizing what Stefan Feld has become as a designer (i.e. phenomenal) I automatically upgrade this game back to 8. :)

So-so two player game that is heavier than most 2 player card games.  I am not sure which varients work best yet.

Me gusta mucho como Feld utiliza los dados en este juego, amplia variedad de cartas, al principio te lía un poco, pero las ayudas del reglamento vienen muy bien. Aunque las partidas no suelen ser demasiado largas, puntualmente pueden llegar a casi una hora.

I was very excited about this game, having seen it presented as a standout 2p game. It looks good, and the design is very solid, but even now that we know what we're doing we find that a few too many games end up as runaway victories for one player or the other. The rest end up being fun, hard-fought contests, so it's not a bad game by any means, but we tired of it far sooner than I had hoped.

Not sure what to make of this game - I can't seem to win it. ever.  Ok, I've only played about 4 or 5 times, but still.  I'll just need to keep playing, I guess.  UPDATE: This is the Lunch Hour Game of the Week (03/20-03/25 - extended to 03/29).  I finally won a couple. Strategies and card interaction becomes much more apparent after a few plays, especially if you're as CCG-rusty as I am.  I'm having a lot of fun with this one - works well, but there can be a lack of control at times.  It's good fun, though.  UPDATE: Can be frustrating when you just can't seem to do anything when you need to.   My rating for this has gone up and then back down in the couple of weeks we've been playing.  It's feels as though the first few rounds are absolutely critical - if you can't get a couple of decent cards out (or even a couple of cheapo's to fill the gaps) you're sunk.  There are a couple of cards that seem over or under-powered for their cost. Roma was a good kind of frustrating for a while, but now it's getting to be frustrating in a bad way.

Just one play so far, but. . .I only managed to draw two cards that award VP (out of about 15 cards drawn).  I got them both to the table, and then never rolled their numbers.  Didn't score a single VP the entire game.  Sounds like this first game just happened to be at the extreme end of the bell curve, but now I'm not sure that the card draws + dice-rolling level of randomness is as fun as I thought it might be from reading about the game.  The card play is fun, though -- when you get to play them!  Interestingly, this Queen game from a European designer is 100% Ameritrash.  Draw cards, roll dice, kill your opponent's stuff.  Go figure!

The components are great, except for one annoying flaw.  The cards could have had text on them instead of weird little symbols, which would've sped things up significantly (there are a couple dozen different cards that you have to look up until you get familiar with them).  Apparently the original German version had this; too bad they made a single multi-lingual version.  Two copies of the card manifest would've been nice.

I'll give it another try or two, but there are way too many quick 2-player games that didn't require second chances competing for my limited gaming time.  I'm a little disappointed in this one.

RATING: 7
This game has some really interesting mechanics and I've enjoyed most every game of it that I've played. Some games ended early because players ran out of victory points, simply because they couldn't get enough cards onto the field and had to pay the upkeep each turn. We also ran into a problem in our very first game, where one player had multiple Forum cards in play, with the accompanying support cards (Basilica or Templum) and very quickly owned the other player. It was such a slaughter that we looked on The Geek to see if there was errata and found others with the same complaint. I don't think these issues are "dealbreakers" for this game, I just think we need to learn to better handle these issues or come up with some minor rules adjustments.

Here's a variant my wife and I came up with to address the perceived strength of the Forum cards:

When a Forum is activated, the player must tap the card like in Magic: The Gathering (rotate it to indicate that it has been used). In order to activate the Forum again, at a later time, the player must roll the appropriate number on the dice track to "untap" the Forum (as is required for the normal actions). After the card has been reoriented, the player may use the card as normal when circumstances allow. Basically this just prevents players from activating Forums every turn and quickly depleting the victory point stockpile. 

We even tried requiring the player to pay the play cost again, in order to untap the card. These changes seemed to help in the five games we played, but I don't know that it is the ultimate solution. The game still seemed to be driven by the player that managed to get the most Forums in play. 

We do plan to also try the previous suggestion about electing to receive only half the Forum proceeds from the opponent, instead of taking the full amount from the stockpile. We've had several occasions where a player could have used a Forum to score some victory points, when trailing the leader, but doing so would have ended the game.

The more we play, the more ways we find to deal with the Forums, so I have high hopes for the game. There are plenty of interesting decisions to be made and we've really enjoyed it, even though we've had to work some kinks out of the system.

Update: We tried the "Half VP from opponent" forum rule variant four times and it seemed to be a good alternative.

Fabulous.  Better than Jambo (for instance) IMO, because you rarely get a bunch of useless cards, and you tend to have plenty of options.  Obviously you can get screwed by horrible dice rolls (especially when attacking), but it's a short and light enough game that it's not a big deal.

[2011-07-07 Rating: n.a.->7.5]
It only took my three years to come up with a rating for this one. :) But the reasons why it took me so long to rate this game explains quite nicely what I think about Roma. Originally, I bought this game to play it with my girlfriend. Well, she just didn't like the game and frankly, it wasn't that much fun to play it with her. She is a more casual player who really dislikes direct conflict. So she didn't even try to find combos that would hurt me and she didn't like me attacking her. So the game was nothing more than a VP race with very little interaction.
This changed once I played Roma with some friends that are into CCGs like Magic or Warhammer Invasion. Suddenly the game became fun. There are different valid ways to win and there are some nice card combinations to discover. Unfortunately, they see Roma merely as a filler and so it doesn't get played too often. Which is a shame, since I do like it a fair share.
To sum it up: The game itself is fine. There are multiple ways to win, it's not too heavy since the dice limit your options each turn and it's fun to discover the various card combinations. But if you think about buying Roma, make sure you know someone to play it with.

RATING: 6
This is a really neat little card game.  Cards have cool interactions like a good CCG, but all the cards are in a common pool.  The action assignment part is brilliant, but the game loses a point for the combat system.  Rolling a die against a target number blows.  Takes away from the really cool role that the dice have otherwise.  All attacks could have been like that 9-cost attacker that uses a second action die to be the attack strength.  Would've been way cooler.

Took away another point because the game could theoretically last forever and long games that are this random are really painful.  Fun if you don't get caught in a bad go.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting two player game, about factional power in Ancient Rome.  Players play cards against a set of "dice platters", numbered 1-6.  On a turn, players toss three dice, and use the dice to activate the matching card to use it's power, or use the dice to draw more cards or cash.  The goal of the game is to exhaust the bank (or other player) of victory points, and the card actions help you gain vp's and also hinder your opponents.  Fun game, interesting card combinations, quick to play, little bit to think about.  Some nice strategy - go aggressive and drain your opponent, or build forums and drain the bank.  Recommended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Kind of overwhelming to learn, since you pretty much have to understand how everything works before you can even start (and the icons are not intuitive at all).  My first game ended very quickly when my opponent rolled the exact roll he needed to get 12 VP, but I'm hoping this was an aberration and I need to try it again.  But if such wild swings of luck are common, this won't be more than a 6.

It's a nice little 2 player. It seems likely that many games will show one player clearly pulling ahead with little chance of a comeback from their opponent. At that point, it's tempting to just quickly end your turns, effectively bowing out early. I like the mechanics at play, but I'm not sure the cards/powers are as balanced as they should be.

Top-notch bits and artwork. All of the criticisms of this game are valid but their is still some strategy involved. Plus, the game is a lot of fun. The game is somewhat abstract and loosely tied to its theme (which is not a quality I like in games).Update: Though the game is visually appealing, after a number of plays, I have to lower my orginal rating of 7 to a 5.5 due to the fact I see very little strategy in the game. It has a decent "fun factor" but the random card draw compounded with the die rolling for actions makes strategy practically impossible. If you desire a light, yet more strategic game for two players, I would suggest Iliad.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Tried this one quite a few times, as it seems to be liked by many, but we just didn't care for it.  It seems as though you are very much at the mercy of card draws and die rolls.  In Jambo, for example, I think you can make due with whatever cards you draw, and if you can't, then that difficulty feels like a fair part of the game (you gambled and lost).  In Roma, I usually feel that one player gets trapped due to nothing more than bad luck, and then can't do much to get out of the hole.  The game is very fast, which is usually a plus, but the game ends before you can develop your strategy.  

UPDATE: After some more plays, I continue to be frustrated by the randomness and lack of even pacing.  There's a lot of cool ideas here, but all too often the game is over before anything interesting can develop.  I've often seen losses that were apparently unavoidable given the die rolls and card draws.  Dropped rating to a 4 and traded the game.

I find it fun and quick to play.  I like the way dice rolls are used to apply to your set of moves .... and of course dice also means luck, but you do have to build an effective layout to make use of your dice rolls.

Good Fun.

(As of [b]4[/b] plays) Definitely not as balanced as its successor, [GAMEID=56931], but still a heck of a lot of fun. Gameplay is listed at 45 minutes, but I don't think any of my plays have lasted longer than 15 minutes, so fast and furious is the action. Lots of reliance on the luck of the dice, without the bribery mechanism of Arena to compensate for it, but it doesn't feel like much of a negative, thanks to the short playing time. Arena is probably a better game, but this one's sheer mercilessness is highly entertaining.

A good understanding of all the different cards is needed before the players can really put some serious strategy into their decisions. The luck of the roll can be partially mitigated by the cards in play.

Alan Moon recommends this highly as a CCG type game for two players.  The interaction between cards (characters and buildings) makes the game very interesting.  It has elements reminiscent of games like Settlers of Catan Card Game (without being as long or heavy), Hera & Zeus, and San Juan, but has its own distinct flavour, especially in how much of the game is about timing, optimizing the order of your moves to maximize card combos and interaction.  It reminds me of a MtG control deck with cards like Impulse and Mystical Teachings.  Time will tell what the replay value is like, but it's quick enough that the luck-of-the-draw elment doesn't matter.  Note: [thread=76496]official errata for Mercatus[/thread] has it take 1VP from opponent, recommended errata for Mercator gives it a 3VP per turn limit.

Also own the sequel [gameid=56931].  For a comparison between Roma I and Roma II, see [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/535162]my pictorial review[/url].

Played wrong the first time.
Has a bit of luck with the dice rolling and card drawing. Also the game can end very quickly.

But a very nice light 2 player, with some confrontation. And does feel a bit like Magic, with all the card effects. 

make sure to have a cheat sheet handy as some of the icons on the cards are confusing.

(2 player) This game is like a box of chocolates: you never know what you're going to get.  Even though the dice add an element of complete chance there are enough interesting things going on so that clever play is rewarded.  I *don't* like the fact that some games can be terribly abbreviated due to the luck of the card draw.  Sometimes you just can't fight back and before you know it, the VP chips are depleted by your opponent and you were never in the running.  Will need to play it more to see if it's just a curve of getting to know the cards and how they work.

Fix from the forum:
Stefan Feld has responded by email to me saying there is indeed a problem. In the early versions of the game, there was a Spy card (draw a card from opponents hand) to balance the mercator. At some point in playtesting, the Spy (and some others) was dropped, forgetting about the mercator issue.

In the meantime, Stefan's suggestion is to define the mercator in this way: you can spend a maximum of 6 ses. with one dice-action.

An okay 2player game, just a shade too complicated for its own good. The cardstock is thin, but the graphics and bits are nice. The symbols are a wee bit small, but mostly easy to understand. A looong rule book, with 2 pages to explain the cards' functions, but you could scrape by with a translation. However, you'll get more fun from Caesar & Cleopatra. Infamy, infamy, they've all got it in for me.

Played again after 7 years, still didn't like it much. Played Roma II next day, liked that a lot more. Why? Really, I just liked the card actions a lot better. The first version seemed crude, the second had more opportunity.

RATING: 8.5
A terrific 2-player card game, and a personal favorite!  The dice mechanic is very neat in choosing actions (similar to the fresh idea with Yspahan).  Every game plays differently - ranging from 15 min. to over an hour.  Strategy and game length rings similar to Magic.  I don't feel the Forum is overpowering once you discover the unconventional methods of turning the tables.  A tense nail-biting experience, and a grossly underrated gem!  And it's a Feld (before he grew to become a top designer).  Grade: B+

RATING: 6
Played 1 time. It's not MY fault that the guy who taught it to me told me it was better than Magic (thus setting my up for a massive disappointment.) Though I thought the die-choosing mechanic was interesting, the combat of the game and powers of the building just felt flat. I like Magic better for combat, and Settlers of Catan the Cardgame better for building powers/interaction. Nothing to bring me back.

RATING: 7
Better than I expected.  It has a very high element of luck in the draw, usually more luck than I like in a game.  I have the feeling with more games there is the potential to maneuver around an opponent's lucky draws.

One of the games I sold and now regret--bought Arena Roma II, and thought I didn't need both.  After I sold it, I read the instructions that said the two games can be combined.

Whenever I pull out Arena Roma II, I have this sinking feeling.

We played three games last night to see for ourselves what some complaints/raves were all about.  It's difficult for me to see how this game can possibly play out any differently than what we saw.  The card mix would let you believe that there are may paths to victory when in fact we just went with the build and use the Forum as much as possible.  The rest is fluff.  You would think that the many cards for destruction should mitigate the importance of the Forum, but in fact they are merely distractions which either slow you down or fool you into thinking you can slow down the opponent.  Nope, there are 6 forums in the deck so you easily can redraw a Nero-ed or Catapulted building to continue the race to get the last points.  Worse yet, is that once your opponent has sprung in the lead (due to an early forum and a few fortunate rolls) there is precious little that can be done to catch up.  For me the fiddler is not on the roof and the music has stopped.

Stefan Feldhez képest meglepően könnyed, gyors és eléggé szerencse alapú kártyajáték. Előnye, hogy gyorsan le lehet zavarni akár több fordulót is belőle, így a szerencse szerep talán kevésbé zavaró. Nekem kicsit kevés volt az opciók száma, így nem éreztem, hogy különösebben hatással lennék a játék folyására. Az jutott eszembe, hogy mi lenne vajon, ha több kockát is fel lehetne használni egy-egy lap aktiválásához: 1+4 = 5. Így ugye akciót áldoznánk fel azért, hogy egy bizonyos kiszemelt akciót aktiválhassunk. Ezzel megnőne a lehetőségek száma.

Players begin a game of Roma in a position where they lose victory points each turn. It's quite possible to be unable to get out of that downward spiral. In this case, the game is over after a couple of minutes.

If both players do manage to make the turn-around it becomes a vicious tug-of-war over a very limited pool of victory points, large swings of luck and swearing at the dice included.

Well - Played two different hour-long "best of 7" sessions in late 2013 using both decks (base Roma 2nd edition plus Roma Arena II).  One play session was a total bust: the dice and cards favored one side so consistently that even over 7 plays it was a total meltdown and black hole of fun.   The other session was close: I think one of us won 4 games to 2.   This game can be maddeningly sensitive to luck.

---------

I tried it again - two back-to-back games with one of the 'fix it' variants.  I still have the same opinion.  I'd really like to like this game and am hoping that Roma II is worth purchasing.

--------

If you expect a functional game out of the box then don't get Roma.  Most Roma sessions are over before you can develop a position.  "Variants" try to fix it but there is no hope. Apparently the designer decided to try and fix the game too!

Roma is awesome. This game has luck, but with it comes a great deal of creativity. Great use of dice in this one, what you roll can be used in different ways. If you're wise with your choices you can greatly skew the game to favor you. 

This one begs to be replayed as every game is different. Sometimes you'll have a bad game where it ends before it ever gets started. Most times it's just a tug-of-war of back and forth power changes. This game can be really intense, and the beauty in it lies in the way the tides can turn. It is possible to make huge comebacks in this game, and the satisfaction of coming back from the brink of defeat is fantastic. The more I play the more possibilities I find, this is a great game.

Addicting 2p game that can be a quick straightforward affair, or a longer, back-and-forth battle.

My current favorite 2 player game. Plays very quick and there's a little more than just 'get the most points'. Since the game ends if the VP pool is exhausted, sometimes you need to make plays that take points away from yourself in order to get delay the ability for your opponent to end the game. While there is a fair amount of luck in the draw of the cards and the roll of the dice, the game plays so quick that it's still quite fun for me. I enjoy trying to machinate a cool combo with the dice and cards. While the icons on the cards aren't perfect for newcomers, you end up learning the cards after 3 or 4 plays - something you can do in roughly an hour.

There is something about this game that makes it okay that I occasionally roll a 1 and fail to kill my opponent's Mercator. It is plain fun for two. I continue to be amazed with the different paths to victory. The cards interact with one another incredibly well. The game is beautiful (I love good looking games). And nothing feels better than pulling off that miraculous move. Negatively, the cards are unbalanced leaving too much luck in the draw and the die, but games are short enough that after a humiliating defeat you can reshuffle and be playing again in seconds.

Nice blend of strategy and luck, and you definitely need to play it more than once to see what's in there. Plusses: more than one approach to winning the game; can use high rolls to search the card deck; sometimes lots of tough decisions. Minuses: overkill on the number of different cards; game can go fifteen minutes or forty-five; once you've got a good setup you can play on autopilot. I need to try it some more to see how replayable it is, but for now it's fun and different.

Cool little quasi-ccg game, without the collectable and deck-building parts. The dice mechanic is a nice new twist on resource management. Less than perfect, probably imbalanced, and I'm not sure it will offer much long-term variety, but worth playing a time or two. Nice cards. Not as tight as Knizia's Blue Moon but I prefer Roma for a quick CCG-style game fix.

My rating requires qualification. I think the game is ultimately unbalanced. The forums are simply too powerful (I've read the arguments against this assertion, but find them unconvincing). So, if that's the case, why do I give Roma a rating of 8?

Because it took me about 15-20 playings to come to that conclusion (including testing some of the "anti-forum" strategies) and I had a blast doing so! It was very intriguing discovering different approaches to take and varying strategies to implement. So, although I probably won't ever play it again, I really enjoyed the times I did.

Is the forum too powerful, or am I not playing it correctly? Are the swings of the dice too decisive? Roma does, indeed, inspire strong and contradictory opinions. I'll have to try it some more to find out for myself how I feel about it definitively.

One of the very few games that uses a dice, that I like!

A great 2 player game with a fair amount of luck and a good amount of thoughts. The dice usually don´t decide the winner, which is the reason why I like it.

The 2nd edition (Arena: Roma 2) is even better and can be combined with this one.

Fairly straight forward two player game, which is a bit heavier than the standard fare filler game.  I like the (random) way your 3 actions are determined, and the game is just the right length for what it is.

Unfortunately, if your opponent keeps rolling high and you roll low, it can be quite difficult to win.

I have yet to win a single game when I have the Merchant.  The Gladiator on the opponent's side can be quite frustrating, especially when you have nothing to counter it.  :(

RATING: 7.25
This is a great quick head-to-head fix for those tired of not being able to interact in two-player games (RftG, Catan card game, etc.).

It provides multiple paths to victory and at the same time it makes direct conflict almost inevitable, if only to protect one's victory point engine.

Lots of people/machines available to break down the other player's structure to win by VP elimination, and more than a couple ways to build a VP machine (basically around Forums).

In my 1st play I ended up with one player trying repetitively to get Forums going, but the other countered with two Onagers, ultimately smashing enough buildings and creating enough gaps to starve the economic whiz. 

This kind of goes against the multi-Forum strategy- I didn't get the Mercator into play so we'll see how that effects the scoring.

Nice art work, and a very clever card activation mechanism help this along to a very satisfying game, even based on only one quick solo play.

Adjusted downward to 7.25, not getting as many plays as hoped.

The dice system feels very fresh and works well. The back-and-forth combat for the non-1st-dying is good. Players have to know if they are dying, and search for the key cards accordingly, or they will die in a hopeless end game, which is not a good game experience.

1st played 12/11/07. taught in ~15min, play in ~30 min. The 1st game is learning experience! Once you break through that, there doesn't seem to be as much to it & it's a fast game. You square off against your opponent & battle for VPs. The play area has 6 discs with each side of 6 sides dice shown once. The deck consists of leaders & buildings. Players start w/ 12 VPs & 4 cards (pass 2 cards to your opponent) Each lay cards face down next to one disc on your side & then both flip (1 card per dice). There are also two other disc (draw cards & take $). On each turn, a player pays a VP for each disc their opponent has a card & you don't. Roll the dice (if all are same you may re-roll). The dice determine which building/leader disc may be activated. Some cards attack an opponent card, capture VPs, reorganize, etc. Placing cards require $. You may place a card w/ $ & then activate it w/ dice. You can also elect to take $=dice value or chose 1 card of cards drawn=dice value. Multiple activations are allowed for each unused dice. You can replace a card on a dice & discard the previous one. Winner is declared when VPs are gone. I'd recommend giving this a gameplay if you can borrow it, however I wouldn't recommend purchase.

Roma is a devilishly clever dice/card game that is absolutely phenomenal when played with the right variants (no more than six gold or cards drawn per turn, second player gets an extra vp to start).  Sure the dice or draw can kill you but there's so much flexibility in the system that the game sparkles with options.  I can't wait to play it more!

I know it's interesting, but I think one should play it quite often to really know the deck and be able to manage cards and dice in a resonable way.

There are a couple of strategies, but one seems much better than the others. Perhaps with more play, my view of the game will change, though.

Jun08: A pretty fun 2-player game.  It's *very* swingy, but that's not a bad thing.  It's got cards, resources, dice and very wild effects.

If I really cared about balance, I might have a cow about this game.  But I just try not to worry about the balance too much.

It's similar to Jambo or San Juan, but maybe a little less deep.  There are plenty of fun decisions to be made with how to use your dice each turn.

Here's some of the variants we've used:

1. Give the 2nd player an extra VP during setup.
2. When activating a forum, you must use the lower of the 2 remaining dice to claim VP.
3. The Mecator has increasing costs.  1st VP = 2 coins.  2nd VP = 3 coins.  Etc.

Still, if you like 2 player card games with some economics, then this is a good bet.

Dec08: Alright, it just isn't holding up.  After playing games with good balance, Roma just becomes too much of a crap shoot.  All too often it seems that the game just chooses a player to smack around.  I'd much rather play Jambo or RftG.

Very disappointing.  Not only is the game mostly decided by luck of the dice and luck of the draw (a good strategy would be to draw forums, as they score a lot of points easily), but once a player has a good lead it is about impossible to take victory points back from him before the endgame is triggered.
At least the graphics are well done...

RATING: 7
Quality two player title that combines variable card powers with a unique modified action point system.  You get three major actions per turn represented by your three dice.  The numbers rolled on your dice determine which actions you may choose from.  It is a system that works rather well.  As with most games with variable card powers some cards are more powerful than others, but in this game all the cards are useful and an opponent with better cards can be overcome with skillful play.

I would have preferred special power text on the cards, but at least they have pictograms on the cards as opposed to Hera and Zeus which had no info on the card to help newbies learn the card powers.

A good little two player game that is fast and fun to play. A lot of "back and forth" in something like Babel but I like this much better, a little more control here I think and less luck (still a good dose of luck here in card draw, way less effect overall than in Babel though).  

It does lack in overall depth or strategy but there is some short term planning and lots of interesting tactics with all the card combos and its a nice short game that should play in 10 - 30 minutes.  

Note that a lot of the complaints about this game are largely exagerrated or unwarranted, I think it plays pretty good the way it is except for the Mercator and the designer has already addressed this and mentions that 2 characters (Spy and Thief) were removed at the last minute which were good counters for the Mercator (a variant IS needed and S. Feld provided one). It can be a very "swingy" game and sometimes ends in 5 minutes or can last 30 minutes or more, I think that was the intent of the design and part of its charm (similiar to the chaos in Babel)

I have the Spy and Thief character cards and will be trying them in the future. In the meantime 2 slight changes weaken him enough to make the game quite enjoyable.

Forums and even the Mercator are powerful no doubt about it but they can be fought with some of the other cards and even destroyed so like I say there is more than one way to skin even a strong cat here. 

[b]Variants:[/b]  -  For now I like the following: 

2nd player starts with an extra VP

No more than 6 dollars can be taken per turn (regardless of how many dice are allocated)

No more than 3VP can be bought with the Mercator per die (this is the designers own suggestion in lieu of Spy and Thief not in the game)

Small, but really great game!! One of the best 2 players games... My surprise for 2005, fun game! This game has some really interesting mechanics and I've enjoyed most every card game of it that I've played along with St.Petersburg and Citadels. 

A negative aspect is Forum cards seem to be too powerful (see BGG General Articles and Variants here). 

I hope there will be an expansion (i.e. more/different character cards) or at least a place on the official website where the best suggestions for the blank cards are collected.

I really liked this game, it is by far my favorite dice game, I enjoy it much more than Kingsburg and Alien Frontiers, however,  as I have played more games this one is beginning to lose its appeal to me. I do think it is a clever design and I will play again for sure, but in my experience, either you win or lose very quick or the game can drag over 1 hour or more. I feel some cards are overpowered (Mercator and Forum).  All things considered, I like the game and I will play it again but beware! This game is mostly luck although it has some tactical decisions. 

To me, it was the best game from Feld until I played In the year of the Dragon.

A pleasant surprise in a 2-player game.  The randomness from the cards and dice are somehow comfortably acceptable as you concentrate on making every effort in getting the most out of your turn actions.  A sound familiarity in card effects is a must (and would have been SO much better had the text been printed on each card).  The unique card effects and their use in combination with others are well balanced (IMO) and very remeniscent of MtG.  -Traded

Two player tug of war in a roman setting. Sometimes the game ends very quick, but most times it goes back and forth. Kind-off an arm wrestling match with tactical card play instead of strength.

Roma es un juego de cartas para dos personas, de una duración de unos 30 minutos.

Es un juego que permite multitud de combos y buenas jugadas. Se colocan hasta 6 cartas delante de cada jugador (1 por cada cara del un dado d6), y por medio de una tirada de dados se activan las distintas cartas, con sus determinadas funciones, como puedan ser la eliminación de una carta del rival, la modificación de la tirada, el jugar una carta nueva,...

Creo que es uno de los mejores juegos para 2 personas de corta duración.

Roma is a card game for two people, playing time around 30 minutes.

You can do a lot of combinations. Six cards are put on the table, in front of each player (a card for each side of a d6 dice). These cards are activated by dice rolling, having each one different powers, as the elimination of an opponent's card, dice modification, new card in game,...

I think it is one of the best two people's game in a short playing time.[/color]

RATING: 7
Roma is a conflict-heavy showdown in which two players configure a row of cards with various powers and then three roll dice to determine their options for that turn. Both players enter play in a tailspin, and if one player is not able to pull up, the game will end in a few minutes. If both players pull up then a tight contest over the victory point pool will begin. Points can be generated quickly via the forum card but also lost quickly if you cannot defend your row from your opponent's attacks.

Roma is a volatile game. The fans swear by it. The detractors say it's far too random. After four plays I'm undecided, but I really like it conceptually. The dice always give you interesting choices and you always feel like a little skill can squeeze surprising results out of them. Each turn, you do your best with the options that arise. It's fast, intense, and lends itself to double and triple headers.

This is a fun little game of die-roll management. The game is relatively light and although there are fun decisions to be made, there's enough luck in the game (mostly through die rolls) to put a damper on overly detailed strategic play. Remaining flexible, responding to your opponent's plays, and using your die rolls well are what the game is about. I'm a bit concerned that the forum is a default strategy but I think the game is deeper than that and the forum is probably the most obvious strategy.

The game is not quite as good as I expect a Stefan Feld game to be, but my expectations are a bit over-the-top considering the amazing games e has designed.

Downgraded to 6/10. The Mercator card reduces my urge to play this again. The proposed tweaks to reduce its power don't go far enough.

Good game for two players. I was afraid that this might be too confrontational to play it with my girlfriend but it worked out fine and we very much enjoyed it. There might be a problem with the mercator card being too strong. While it was not used in the first three games, it decided three of the next four games in favour of the player being able to use it.

RATING: 6
I don't particularly care for the theme, but the way that the dice are used is a little unusual, and the game plays quickly and can be fun!  At first, the number of different cards (in the form of people and buildings) can be a little overwhelming, but you get used to it fairly quickly.  I can sort of see how (as others have said) the game kind of plays you, since once you have a good set-up, you can pretty much milk it until your opponent manages to take out one of your cards.  I suppose that once both players are experienced the game becomes much more competitive.  A familiarity with the cards would definitely change how the game plays.  I hope to put in a few more plays, as many seem to have tired after some initial enthusiasm.

Update: just never had the chance or will to play it.  It's an interesting game, but with so many 2-player games competing for my attention, I didn't feel bad trading this one away.

RATING: 7
A very interesting game, fairly easy to learn and very little downtime. As with most card games, there is an element of luck with the draw and with the dice-rolling to determine the turn actions. I think the biggest problems were the missing text on the cards (too many symbols to remember) and the dice-based combat.

RATING: 8
Wonderful two players game. Interesting mechanism: you have to use dice to activate the cards. Great and beautiful components. 
Be careful: Revolte in Rom is the german edition, with text in german in the cards, the international edition is called "ROMA", with no text in cards (only clear icons, you won´t need the reference sheet after the first game) and the rules in English, Spanish, German and French.

I had high hopes for this game after the first play. I had been looking for a game that would require tactical change based on the actions of the other player - even if based on a simple rock/paper/scissors formula.

At first I saw this happening with Roma but after more plays I am concerned that there are clearly dominant strategies and that the game will become repetitive as both players go after the same strong cards and ignore the same weak ones. If this is the case it becomes mainly about luck and that is not satisfying enough for me. Still I recommend playing this game a few times because discovery of the dominant strategies can be fun - don't bother reading any strategy articles though as that would take away this advantage.

The disadvantage of limiting yourself to a few plays is that if you don't have someone good to explain the game it can take quite a lot of referring to the rules to figure out what the cards do.

Update: the more I play this the more I feel the game is playing me. The choices are just not interesting enough - much too obvious.

RATING: 8
Very nice game with some clever and original mechanics.  Card-drawing and dice-rolling luck can be important but if the game lasts long enough these should even out.

Every game develops differently.  There is much luck, but that's okay -- the game is about dealing with circumstances, some beyond your control; just do your best.  Some strategies are strong or important, but not unbeatable.  
Update: This was fun for about 16 games, then the centrality of the fora got a bit tiresome.  I should try Roma II, which I think changes that.
Slighly similar games with more legs than 'Roma' are 'Battle Line', 'Glory To Rome', and 'Innovation'.

RATING: 8
Needs more playings but generally I like it, as with any game with dice luck plays a factor with what you can do each turn and a series of great rolls for an opponent, or bad ones for you can be frustrating.  There seem to be a lot of different approaches you can use to play this, but only a couple that work well.  I've enjoyed my few plays of this so far but the games have ranged from 15 minutes to 2.5 hours, will definitely need more plays before I decide for sure.  Right now though: 7

Edit: after many plays, this game is still fun and interesting.  Yeah there is a good deal of luck considering the card draws and dice rolls but for me that doesn't detract from the gameplay.

It works if you can get your spouse to like it, since you can play it together over and over, but you can't really introduce it to new players unless they're going to want to play many games of it, enough to finally make it worthwhile that they learned aaaaaalllllll the different characters and what they do.

The only card game (so far) that my wife approved and is willing to play on a daily basis. Not that complicated as RftG and way more depending on luck. Because of that I prefer RftG, but this is still a very good game tha I ejnoy. Also, can be surprisingly cutthroat, since some cards (like mercator) are simply nasty.

Roma is a simple game that combines cards and dice in a quite intriguing way. Its main drawback can be kinda obvious if you think of what its core mechanism revolve around: luck. There are several mechanisms which reduce it a bit, but if someone is lucky with both the draws and the rolls, well, victory will be uncontested.

Leaving the luck aside, Roma is a fun and light game which can be played quite quickly. The box says it's played in 45 minutes, but to date I haven't played a game that dragged more than 20. And I feel it's the perfect length for a game of its weight.

Another minor drawback of the game are the components: it's always nice to have language independent components, but up to a point. While some symbols are quite intuitive, the more complex ones are hard to decipher. Leaving the symbols aside, the illustrations are great, though the mechanisms themselves aren't particularly thematic.

All in all, Roma offers a fun card and dice combo. A wee bit too luck driven, yet it offers enough control to remain interesting, particularly considering its short length.

Played it without having read the rules and let my opponent read the actions of the cards. DON'T DO IT

Both players should be fully aware of the possibilities of each card.
There is a lot of strategy in this quick card game but there is also some luck involved.

Have to play it more to adjust rating.
This will be at least a 7 to me. Because I feel there is plenty to discover.

I'm not a big fan of games, which includes a lot of special cards. I'm not a fan of dicefest games either so its not a big surprise that I didn't like Roma. But still... I was expecting more. I like a Babel (Kosmos 2 player game) a lot and Roma feels a bit like it, but its not as good as Babel. Babel strengthness are: only couple of rules, quite a lot of control, opportunities to make interesting maneuvers... but those are missing in Roma. OK, you can make interesting maneuvers, but you'll need exactly right dice results. Then there is a possibility that one game takes too much time.

[2007.May.26] A fast, light, lucked-based, tactical game. You make the best of what your dice rolls (and cards) offer each turn.

In my top five for two player specific games as it combines a bit of luck with some decision making on how to use the dice and what cards to play.

I should really love this game. The rules are simple (3 pages) and the gameplay reminds me of Settlers of Catan. (roll some dice, use dice to choose actions). The reality, however, is far from fun for three reasons.

First, the card powers are not intuitive and the icons are not very helpful. I've played the game three times and still have to consult the rulebook regarding each card's abilities.

Second, downtime is an issue. In most games you can plan while the other player is making a move. Not so in Roma. You have no idea what you will be able to do until you roll your dice. As such, advanced planning goes out the window.

Finally, the game rewards making the other player lose instead of trying to win yourself. This is due to the two possible conditions for the endgame: one player is out of victory points, or the victory point pool is empty.  It is much easier to lose victory points, than to gain them.

Although I like the game mechanics, the game can turn boring as each person has to lookup the special abilities and there is no way to plan ahead while the opponent is taking a turn.

I wished I liked this game, but cannot.

Traded.

This is a game which develops and evolves as you play, moving from plain survival to clever card manipulation as you move deeper into the game.  I guarantee the strategy you start with will not be the one you end up with.

The game is based on a small deck of cards, which has borrowed many ideas from CCGs in type of cards and mechanics, but utilises dice to drive the game and provide an additional level of decision making and chance.

Though the deck of 52 cards and range of types of cards appears too small for any depth there is surprisingly enough room for creativity and tactics which offers real replay value.  Feld's clever touch is when carrying out actions it does not matter how many times or in what order they are carried out allows the player room to exercise their brain cells.

The only downside is the rule book which has several holes and in politest terms encourages house rules from the start.

Good fast-paced lunch game, although it needs a bit of space to lay out.  Has the right mix of luck and strategy employing both cards and dice.  It seems particularly important where you lay your cards.  That, and get a Forum. And a Temple if you can.

Mercator cap of 3vp per turn seems like a good optional rule.

This game is all about the card powers. Then you have to be lucky enough to get the dice rolls you need to turn on these cards.

Basically the game seems to boil down to luck of the draw and/or dice rolls.

I enjoy playing Roma quite a bit, and the quick setup time and generally short playtime makes it a good one for regular play. The length of play does vary a bit, with some games being over in minutes while others run for half an hour.

There is a good amount of conflict in this game, which will appeal to some and put others off. I like this, and also like that it's an option rather than something forced by the game. Depending on your starting setup you might pursue conflict, or avoid it to focus on something else.

This is markedly different from Stefan Feld's bigger designs in feel, but there's many of the same mechanics in play, particularly the idea of using dice in different ways.

Seems  to be a game where the leader just gets better while the losing player sits there hoping to get a miracle card to change the inevitable.  Will try a few more times before relegating this to the trade pile.Update- There are nice aspects to the game.  Cards with different uses, how to balance your cards in play for offense and defense, when to make changes with your card layout, etc.  But it still boils down to drawing the card you need, and dice rolls allowing to use the cards you need to, large dice rolls with the right numbers to allow you to activate the forum and get big scores, etc.  Luck of dice rolls and luck of card draw make the game too random, and my first impressions still hold.  I traded my copy away.  I recommend getting ATON.  Much better game. Lowered ranking to a 3.

Fresh ideas, a nice if unoriginal theme and a healthy dose of luck (which all quick two-played games I like seem to have). Got on my to-buy-list after a first play, although I've failed to actually buy it yet. A second and third play confirmed that I should go ahead and do that, soon.

I like this one.  It loses some points for being a 2-player game only, but it's so fast and easy I have to give it a fairly decent rating.  Gets more play at home with the teenage son than with the group, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

This one has a bit of luck in it but I think it is managable. I used the rule where the mercator could only spend 6 ses per die. This helps the game a lot. I like this better than adding in the spy or thief since the game becomes less about controling this one card.

I enjoy it, but man is it random. Of course, the game is all about dealing with the randomness, but victories feel less rewarding here. Well, the games are quick, and you get to see many different paths to victory. I´ve played it a few times with adults, but above all it shines as a fun game to play with my son (12). When both players know the deck, the game moves along at quite a clip.

The more I play Roma, the more I love it.  At first the Forums seem very powerful, but other cards can also be very powerful if played correctly.  Nice mix of strategy and luck.  There can be a runaway leader problem, but the game plays so quickly it is not really an issue.

RATING: 8
A shortish 2 player game combining dice rolling, tableau building and card drafting.  The luck associated with the dice rolling can be partially mitigated by some of the cards on offer, but a run of good or bad luck can heavily influence the odds of victory.  Rules are simple enough to quickly get a hang of, with detailed descriptions of each card provide in the rules. Enjoyable game and looking forward to seeing how many viable strategies I can discover (found the power of the forum and hence the need for a counter forum strategy in my first few plays). Rated 7.5 initially, may go higher.

Tras 4 ó 5 partidas: cierto que tiene su estrategia y la cantidad de cartas lo hacen variado, pero para mi gusto tiene demasiado azar y no siempre es controlable. Creo que para 2 jugadores hay juegos mucho mejores. Al menos las partidas son cortas

Great 2-player game.  Lots of conflict here as you try to break through to your opponents side to inflict damage while your opponent does the same thing to you and you need to block.  You make points with forums, but you need to defend them or you get nothing.  There is also quite a bit of chaos here, but that doesn't bother me!

Received 11/28/09. Played 32 times as of 08/27/17. 

Random (the dice control most of what you can do), yet there is room for strategy. Very steep learning curve (the allegedly language independent diagrams on the cards are almost worthless, you had better have a cheat sheet or the rules at hand). And even if you have the rules at hand many of the cards are not fully explained. You must have one of the (better) fan generated cheat sheets in the BGG files section to play the game effectively without endless questions. Nice artwork, I like the Roman theme.

Feels very tight - you don't have much time to strategize or your opponent will pull ahead, so you need to make the best of what you have.

Nice tactical 2-player game which has a nice balance in tactics & luck. There are dice, but for every single one of the 3 dice you roll, you have various options. I'd like to play this one more to see if my initial rating will go up or not.

Update after 5 plays: rating goes up. Thanks to various possible tactics. The dice prevent long term strategies, but it's a good tactical game.

6 years later: now Feld has become something of a eurohero, I'm afraid to say this is his only game that has gotten on my table once in a while. But it's only a decent filler. But there are better ones.

Fun, quick and mean. 

Update: My second go around of this was just OK. It was just as quick as before, but seemed a little pointless as I got into a recurring action of blocking his scoring die. We may have been playing wrong as it seemed a little weird as building was bought, placed after the dice were rolled, and scored for the win. There seems to be some design flaws here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Game in a Nutshell: Line up, roll dice and assign them to  cards in order to beat down the opposing side.

Played as: 2 player

Pros: I like how in order to use a card on your "battle line" you need to roll the number assigned to it. Ok, that sounds lame, but what makes it interesting is you assign the card its number and high number rolls are especially nice for gaining money or drawing loads of cards instead of activating your "5" or "6". This creates a sort of balance of putting your best cards on low numbers such that there's never a bad roll. The activate-able powers of each card also combo in some interesting but very different ways that allow for several strategies in taking your opponent down.

Cons: The best laid plans can fall apart quickly, and yes, luck will have a roll in it. Sometimes you'll look and hope for a certain card, finally find it, build it, then watch it get destroyed before it ever felt like you had it. Probably not as much variety in the cards as most card games these days which leaves me with the question of longevity.

Other: With all the "Battle-line" style games out there I think this is one of, if not the best. I actually like how strategies can deteriorate and tactics need to take over. The dice give it a twist but in a way that's mitigate-able. Some people may find all this a turnoff, so it may not be the game to play with those light-hearted types. I haven't played many Feld games, but if this is what they're like, I may be a new fan.

Best Use: A fast battle card game for those who understand you can't always get your way.

Well, I find it difficult to rate this game. On one hand, it does feel like you have meaningful decisions to take; on the other, the randomness can be crippling and often times the winner will be whomever is luckiest. Some of the cards are definitely a LOT more powerful than others (eg. temple). Some games will be over in 10 mins or less while other will take 30/45mins to finish. Despite all these drawbacks, I found myself enjoying the time I spent playing it.

After 5 games I think its always the same.

Give me a good variant for the forums or an idea to get a game length (in turns) and it will be again a 8.

Händler (Merchant Card) seems way to strong: Just get this card to your hand cards and collect a lot of money (and it  is very easy to get money in this game). All you have to do now is to play the card out of your hand to a not used dice, then use this dice in the same round and buy as many victory points from your opponent as you can get. 
We play now without this card.
Apart from this, it is a nice and simple game.

Quality game that involves a fair chunk of luck. Lots of strategies available, you just have to hope the dice are on your side. The occasional one-sided game detracts a little, but fortunately these don't occur too often. When the game is good, it is very very good, etc...

Solid two player.  Great game of making the best choices with what rolls you get and knowing the cards you need to properly oppose your opponents row.  Great fun.  Requires a good handle on all the cards and what/when they do what they do.  A quick game with a seasoned opponent.  I like Roma II slightly more - combined, with a 110 card draw deck I rate it a 9.  I still dislike the icons of Roma.

Almost pure luck. Very little you can do to mitigate your own bad rolls, much less your opponent's good rolls. And the randomness of the card draws only exacerbates the problem.

I have flipped over this game! Played with Fubar last night. Several games went down. First game:"This is a nice, medium weight 2-player." Second game: "Yeah, this is a really good little game." By the last game: "Wow, this thing is fabulous! What a hidden gem!"
The more we played, the more interactive (and ruthless) it became. And it plays quickly. 15-20 minutes, tops. And it is easy to learn, though it will take several plays to get the feel for how well Stephan designed this thing.

EDIT: Well, still fun, but gets a little flat after a while. But that is not the fault of the game. It is what it is.

Ok... you're depending on a lucky hand of dice rolls so you're not really in full control of the game play, but that didn't bother me! Roma is a very delicious "screw the other guy" card game with some very easy rules (especially when you know this game is a Feld game). I got this game in a trade at Essen 2014 for a very decent price, and I believe it has been one of my best trades so far.

RATING: 7
In this Roman themed game, players sit opposite six disks, numbered one through six. Play cards on your side of the disks. Each turn, roll three dice to determine which disks are activated. Players can then activate the card on the appropriate disk, use any of the dice for money or number of cards to draw, but only keeping one in your hand. Play until the supply of VPs runs out or someone gets below 0 VPs.  The cards themselves allow you to gain VPs, or destroy cards of your opponents, recover cards, give special bonuses, etc. It's a fun, interactive game, with a good dose of luck due to the dice rolling, but I think it is okay. There are some powerful cards, such as the Mercator, and the designer has mentioned the counterbalancing cards did not make it into the edition of the game.

Nice, quick cutthroat card laying game.  There's good ebb and flow to the game, and once you know the cards, I can't imagine a game taking more than 20 - 30 minutes.  I like how they implement the dice into the resource gathering and card activation.  Fun choices, but not generally too tough.

Oh my goodness, what a giant, leaping dice-fest this thing is! You marry a random card-draw game to a random dice-drop game and they spawn Roma.  Fortunately the trappings are interesting enough to ease the pain a bit, but really, when you look under the hood all you have is random upon random.I got a look at this one sober when first introduced.  I think I'll need to have the goggles on before taking a shot at her again.

RATING: 5.5
Card-driven, almost LCG-like, duel with a dice activation mechanism. It's a race to best of 36 VPs, or eliminate your opponent's VPs, and gameplay can drag if you are stuck in the 6-10 VP range for vast swaths of the game. But there are card combos (with the right dice) that can net potentially 14 VPs in a turn, which is essentially game-deciding. Not my type of Feld (or my type of 2-player game).

RATING: 7.5
It plays out much faster tan advertised. Some games can be longer, but they use to be finished in 20 minutes.

I love this 2 player game, the game flow is very fast, it is intense, it offers many decisions to impact the outcome, lots of replayability... Every game is completely different! 

It is too luck dependant though, some games are very unbalanced since the beginning.

The Spanish manual is a pile of shit. It contains many mistakes and some card powers are totally wrong.


Update to Merchant by Feld: limit buying to 3 points.


Variants proposed by fans:
1. Mercator: 5 Munies to 1 V.P. 
Expensive? Yes. But it just works.

2. Velites and Onager: Limit strike range to three cards (direct opposite and two adjacent). Again it just seems to help balance the game.

Errata in English: the Mercatus building steals 1 VP from the other player for each Forum.

Now here is a dice game I can get on board with. Lovely intricate art complements the style of the game and gives it a good 'Classics' feel. The theme could have been anything, and there seems to be no good reason why Ancient Rome should be better than anything else, but somehow it does work. The gameplay is intricate, and requires some serious planning, given that you only have three variables to play with. It'll take a good ten plays or so to get up to speed, but damn - it feels worth it when you are!

Further Thoughts: 20 games, and it feels we've done all we can with this one. Downgraded from 9 to 7.5

RATING: 8
Definitely a gamer's game, as it takes time to learn how all the cards work (plus the publisher made a huge mistake by not printing each card's properties directly on each card). I really like the basic concept of how this game plays, and the artwork on the cards is well done and attractive. The rulebook is underwritten, and although attractive, the order in which material is laid out could be confusing for some. Also, the one mistake the publisher made--and it was a big one--was to not print on the cards what each card allows players to do, because as it is, one has to constantly refer back to the rule book to know how to use the cards. What I did was boil the rules down to a one-sheet reference,with card descriptions on the other side. Took me a while to learn how to play this correctly, but once I did I immediately liked it a lot. Probably not something to spring on non-gamers, however, as I've tried, unsuccessfully (a non-gamer friend of mine played it twice, and although he won one, he rated it a "3", declaring it "difficult" to learn). Acquired used in April of 2008.

50+ plays. Very clever design and I thoroughly enjoy the game everytime I play. The game has a lovely balance between weight of attack vs VP gathering, oftentimes games hanging in the balance and dependent on what can get activated when. The cards provide lots of different options in how to go about the win, providing the variety needed for replay, with enough luck to keep things interesting and non-predictable, even when you thing you're in a winning situation. Some games are fast - some are momentous see-saws with multiple changes in strategy. There's a learning curve involved in the cards and games can be slow until you're up the curve, but worthwhile climbing. 
Btw, we only play with the designer approved variant where the Merchant / Handler can only buy 3 VP's each turn. Which makes it more counter-attackable and less overwhelming when it gets into play. 
Overall, big thumbs up, especially for a dice game.

Feels like a foot race involving tackling. 2 players each use Ancient Roman characters and buildings to acquire the limited victory points better and faster than the other. Fast, Brutal, Clever Action-Point Allowance Game using cards and dice in a cool and intricate way.

My wife is good at this game. However, each time we pulled out the game, we liked it less and less, and we decided to "Jones Theory" it out of our collection.

Rulebook a little fiddly; confusing icons may need clarification.

Fairly entertaining 2-player, but funny things happen on the way to the forum.  Use the variant allowing a trailing player to take half (rounded down) from the opposing player for forum activations rather than the full amount from the till.  German version given to BS.  Looking forward to sequel, called "Gladiator".

Clever little game. Despite only using traditional "lucky" mechanisms (dice and card-draws), it's way less random than it appears at first sight. Also very portable. Rules are simple to explain, even though it usually takes people a while to learn which card does what. Once they understand the symbols, all is well though.

After one play, wife and I agree this is the best of the five new games we've tried in the last 2 weeks, which includes Kingsburg, Thebes, Louis XIV, and Jambo. Funny how the $20 games turn out to be the best, while the $50 games didn't do much for us. Roma has simple rules, still retains strategy, just the right amount of luck, great looking cards, and most important, it's entertaining!

Roma was Stefan Feld's first published game, and it feels like it in multiple ways. On one hand, the "dice placement" mechanism was very reminiscient of newer games like The Castles of Burgundy or Bora Bora, and I liked that almost as much here as in the other games. However, here there are fewer ways to mitigate your dice rolls, you're pretty much stuck with what you've got, which feels very limiting. This game also has a lot more take-that than his newer games, but I guess that's less of a worry in a 2-player environment. My main complaint, though, is that the game lacks any sort of game clock--it just goes on until either a player's points are depleted, or the point stock is depleted. With a number of ways to gain and lose points, there's really no predicting how long the game will last--it could end in 10 minutes or 2 hours.

RATING: 7
I'm really enjoying this game.  It can be frustrating at times (like when your wife ALWAYS seems to end up with a Forum, a Templum, and the necessary die rolls!), but it keeps calling me back for more, and I gladly obey.  A bit of a learning curve since you do need to learn what cards do and how to combine cards and actions effectively.  About the only criticism I have is that there have been a number of games which have ended just as we were getting going.  Not sure what effect it will have on balance, but I may try it with allocating more VPs to each player or more VPs total.

(Update 12/21/08):  It's been a while since we've played this one, but the same feeling of done-before-it's-started is still there.  The diceplay is just too swingy for a game that feels like it should be more.  Downgraded to a 7.

I'm not a fan of head-to-head card games, but this one is enjoyable. It is quick to understand and has a good dice-dynamic. Luck is not very involved, as soon as you can get more money with higher dice, but you can balance this using the right cards on lower positions. Unfortunately I bought this game in Germany and cards came all written in german language, without the helping icons that appear in other versions: this makes it really difficult to play and makes me drop down the rating. I suggest international players to avoid this game, unless they don't want to remake their own cards.

RATING: 7
The game is mostly based on luck: how you roll at the start of your turn or while attacking. And of course card drawing is luck-based.
But it's alright because you can decide by yourself what to do with the dice at the beginning of your turn.

It takes quite a while to learn the cards. Some of the symbols are not easily interpreted. But they will become more familiar while playing. The cards are quite well invented. Only some generic attack cards are involved but they are must anyway.

Playing time could be a bit shorter but it's okay this way too. 
A refreshingly unique two-player game, which gives you a lot of fun in the form of discovering some pretty combos you can do with your cards and dice.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Nice 2 player game.  After 5 plays, all of the games were completely different.  One game, Forums seemed really powerful, the next they just took up space, the next was all about the merchant, then aggressive play.

It may be just due to getting used to the cards, but it really seems like they'll be a ton or replay value in this one.

Update after 12 plays: Games are not as different as originally seemed.  With only a couple of cards that let you select cards from the deck or discard pile, you can't go in with a strategy.  The cards you get usually force you into an obvious role.

Still not a bad game, but I'd put it at 65/35 on the luck side.

RATING: 9
Very quick and fun game. A lot of luck or unluck with the dice of course, but this game is so fast anyway so you just start another game afterwards. 
A lot of fun tactics to be used. 
I liked how our 2 games ended differently. One of them ended when we used up the last victory points chip. The other again none of use ever got hold of many VP's and it ended when one of us lost his last VP. Totally different games.
And this game is very portable, and easily fits on a small table.

Rather lightweight but fun and exciting game. First couple of plays may drag due to constant checking of character abilities. Has something of a ccg vibe to it (the quest for perfect cards synergy combined with luck of the draw/dice). There are some definitive aggressive/defensive combos/strategies, but fate and fortune will force you to adapt and change stance during a game.

*Update*
Holy Moly this game is a luckfest! While I still find it reasonably fun I have abandoned any illusion of there being any amount of strategy or even tactics. Just roll with it.

I got to play this game at my local meetup today.

This is a nice version of tug-o-war for two players. You throw dice to determine what action you can take with your cards and you can only have 6 cards (each assigned to each die face) at once and you can spend dice to draw cards or get money (needed to play cards). 

The victory point pool is shared and the game ends when the vps are all gone from the bank or one player loses his/her vp tokens.

It feels like a faster Jambo with less combos to work with. But it also feels more streamlined than Jambo.

One quick play of the type of game I dislike due to the fact your opponent has a few options to consider at the beginning of their turn and you sit and twiddle thumbs as you won't have much in your hand to think about until it's your turn.

It is a light filler, which is very heavy on the luck.
Two main paths with some interesting card combinations. Drain the bank using the forum cards or be aggressive and try to force your opponent to zero. 
  
Forum card scoring seems to be stronger. Get good rolls... as a counter you must kill the powerful scoring cards quickly.

Use the rule of 6 variant: Limit cards and cash to a maximum of 6 each per round. Also the Mercator limit to 6 to spend. At least this gives a chance to respond.

A two-player game that we enjoy a lot, both the theme and the mechanics. My wife and I have played it countless times.
It's compact, easy and plays very fast. When starting a game of Roma you wonder whether it's gonna be good fun (quicker ones) or epic fun (longer ones).
It uses an innovative mix of cards and dice. The dice don't determine what happens, they just open different possibilities. In fact, there are so many options available at every turn that you always got tough decisions to make.
Some cards (characters or buildings) are stronger than others. But even with a significant luck factor, it is the combination of cards that you activate what makes the game, and there are a lot of different both aggressive and defensive strategies. Great replayability.

RATING: 7
Odd sort of two-player game.

Sometimes the game can be over in a few minutes, as one (or both) players quickly run out of VPs, then the next game will take 45 minutes as someone slowly exhausts the bank's supply.  Still, it's entirely playable, although there are other, better 2-player games.

Definately get the multi-lingual edition - the German original has all the special powers written on the cards which non-German speakers will struggle with; the international edition has icons which bear only a passing resemblance to the actual power, but it's better than struggling with the German.

A game for the hard to satisfy two player only game market.  The economy is simple enough.  The mechanics are simple enough.  One can even get through their first play without memorizing the benefits of all the cards in the game.  As I played it the first time, it was hard to find a goal to work towards. Floundering a round or two did not help me win this victory point race.  As the rounds advanced, I not only needed to score, but to try to knock my opponent down a peg.  Whereas he only needed to outscore me and not worry about limiting my play, being in the lead.

RATING: 8
neat card game. the game has a bit of a learning curve because all the cards have variable powers and use symbols instead of words to convey what it is they do, but once you play it a few times, the symbols become more meaningful. the game can be swingy, but that's the nature of these ccg-like games, sometimes the games will be close, sometimes they will be blow-outs. i'm surprised by how well the dice as action points work. clever card placement will stretch the most out of even the worst rolls. sometimes the dice can be cruel, but that isn't too different from how luck dependent the mana engine in magic is. take the merchant out from the deck before playing, though. the card is obviously broken and it's inclusion in the game is a mistake. i wouldn't want to fiddle around needlessly with the game, just to fix one card. i look forward to the designer's next game.

Out of all Stefan Feld games I've played, this one I liked the least. It's not bad as a filler, but luck swings can be disastrous: some games are won on first few turns, other can drag for more than half an hour. Some cards are supposedly overpowered, especially the infamous Forum. This seems to be quite true, but I did loose a handful of games which appeared easy with the amount of Forums I had.

It just feels like there are no planks floating on the sea of randomness to hold down to. Not much can be planned, not much accounted for.

RATING: 7
Excellent 2 player game, plays quickly and litely. Usually you can put any dice roll to good use and there are some nice combinations of actions possible. But if the dice are constantly against you, you don't stand a chance. It seems to be hard to come back if you fall behind and then it takes some time until the game ends even though it is clear that you stand no chance anymore.

My rating for Roma could increase.  Roma has a really high entry fee.  What I mean by that is that there's a lot of stuff to know before you can begin to be competitive.  That's normally fine in my opinion.  I love Race for the Galaxy and do not mind the learning curve.  I guess it's a little less acceptable for Roma because it's possible to lose the game quickly with no chance of winning.  

I want to play Roma again though, which is a good sign because normally a rate a game 6 when I can see why other people would like it, but when I probably would not want to play it.  Roma is different.  It's an interesting game and it's got a lot of conflict for a two player game.

Like many other fans of Roma, I wonder about the balance of certain cards (Forum, Merchant, etc.) but it's fun to try to work out ways to prevent these cards from overpowering the game.
I love the way cards and dice mix in such a simple way, yet reward clever play. There's definitely some luck involved, but the experienced gamer is going to have the upper hand.
Overall: I don't usually like two player games, but this one has shown me just how enjoyable they can be. Tons of fun.

I dunno.  There is a pleasing rhythm here, but the strategies seem fairly obvious, and it takes concerted effort to defeat a forum-based strategy (with the revised merchant rules).  My 9 year old daughter loves it as it is not too confrontational and you get to play with money and build things.

Mixed feelings. Of 5 games, 4 were done in less than 4 turns. A LOT depends on the starting hand. The reasons were varied, but in general, the one who gets multiple forums and draws to activate them early on will likely win if opponent can't respond with attacks or steals. Another way to win is to quickly remove opponent's cards on table, thereby causing major VP losses.

Fantastic 2 player card game with great theme and bits.  The card play reminds me a bit of Jambo and Babel.  Jambo in that you have to play the game a few times to understand what is available in the deck for strategy purposes.  It reminds me of Babel in the "take that" aspect.  The dice mechanic is novel and the game has a real fun feel to it.  Highly recommended.

RATING: 8
This has definitely become the #1 game in our house. It's playtime in usually very quick and there are different viable and competing strategies the players can take to win the game. There is a fairly high degree of luck involved. This is not a negative in my opinion. Rather it ensures each new game will play differently than the last. Very occasionally, one player is eliminated within the first few rounds because of a bad starting draw. Fortunately this is rare, and the game is over so quickly that it's never been a big deal. Your starting strategy is usually dictated by the cards drawn in the first round. Once dealt though, you can often change directions if your opponent isn't fortunate enough to combine a lucky first card draw with lucky dice rolls. The two ways to win the game are to have the most VP on hand when the stockpile is empty (usually by using political type cards), or to cause your opponent to lose all his VP (by using a militaristic approach or with aggressive political cards). For being just a deck of cards, the game nearly drips with theme for me. This is a combination of the card art, the way each card affects the game uniquely, and the way the game is won.  Sometimes an aggressive approach with combat units is not enough to stop the political juggernaut built by your opponent. Other times a political approach won't win favor with the people if you can't protect your gains against your opponent's legions.

Roma is a great game offering plenty of fun and replay. Considering the price and the fun we've had, it's a tremendous value. Highly recommended!

Good game but somewhat lacking in replayability. The wide selection of characters and buildings would be a plus if not for the fact that only a handful of the cards ever seem all that useful in ANY game. Because of this, most games come down to using die rolls to cycle through the deck until you find the same few cards.
Play time can also vary quite dramatically. Some games yo-yo back and forth forever while others can be over in minutes.

Cool mechanics in this game. I think, the theme is a little weak and there are some startpositions, where you are destined to lose. But it's quick, fun and most of the games were balanced and cut-throat. Also I think the merchant isn't such a big issue. In my games we never have had so much money to buy a lot of VP from the opponent until the merchant was kicked by a Centurio.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Implement the designer's post publish rule that the Trader can buy a maximum of three victory points per turn and this game becomes a balancing act that can see saw for an enjoyable half hour or so.

Reminds me of Jambo, but with a better theme, less "take that" and much less fiddly. (Also scratch the trading.) The turns go by quickly and there are a reasonable number of choices to be made, with the ability to vary your tactics quite quickly. A fun game that will play quickly once players become familiar with the actions of the cards. A two player game to keep.

Has gone up in my ratings due to some cracker games! A darn fine and enjoyable dice game. I find it difficult to play with the International edition - same problem as in Hera and Zeus, but multiplied several fold. Much prefer the German version with the action written in text on the card. If an English - text on cards - edition was published I'd be giving this to everyone I know as a gift for Christmas.

An enjoyable two-player card game which also features action dice to move game play along.

This prevents the Mercator from becoming too powerful.

I was turned off to this game at first because of complaints of lack of control.  I can see where that's coming from, but that's something I can live with.  The real problem here is that one of the two avenues to victory, depleting the pool of VP, pretty much requires the Forum cards, which can have a pretty violent swing effect on the game, especially with Temples and Basilicas.  The rest of the game is pretty neat, though, and the decisions largely non-trivial, but I could see the whole Forum thing just kind of breaking the game experience.  Also, sometimes text is just better than confusing icons, hey?

Update: I should have seen this coming, but with more experience under my belt it's much easier to control the Forum's effect on the game.  It's easy to underestimate the value of emptying your opponent's slots to force them to lose points.  You can still lose quickly due to luck, but the game is not as one-dimensional as it first appears.

Very addictive. Ones you know the cards, there are so many options!
Although every player has his cards laid out on his side, there is a lot of player interaction, due to  cards that let you mess up the the cards of your opponent.

I have played this maybe 70 times the ... wrong way, but preferred it much more than the right way.
We played it, that one die was admitted to one action, so no multiple actions.

When played that multiple dice may be used for the same action, then this game scores only a 4.

Roma -- Played once.  

Some AP, but familiarity should eliminate that.

Learned that the Turris should be placed by high numbers, since it requires no die to activate it, thus freeing high numbers rolled for use on the money or card discs.  And the cards which allow you to build other cards for free should be placed by lower numbers -- since these cards [i]do[/i] require activation, why tie up high rolls for them?

RATING: 7
[12 plays] There is an initial learning curve to familiarize oneself with the card names, icons, and their abilities. Once past that hurdle, this is a good game with some interesting decisions on every turn. Good players will find a need to have both an offensive and a defensive strategy - and like the old cliche, sometimes the best defense is to go on offense and nuke your opponent's card that is hurting you.

I look forward to seeing how "Roma II" cleans up the iconography and perhaps adjusts the Mercator's power.

I was told that this was a more complex Jambo/CCG type game. I HAD to get it. I still kinda prefer Jambo (where trading = money = vp).

Players play characters into the play area and use them to gain VPs through various means.

Yes, there is die rolling but the card effects and card draws force you work around bad rolls. Wish the card had text on it ala Jambo instead of the user unfriendly icons.

In any case, this is NOT like the settlers card game (only the die rolling is similar).

This game has decent replay value and I suspect a small expansion with new cards will give this game legs.

And the Forum is very stong...

Played once, but I think I got a good feel for it.  Lots of different powers on the cards, making for a game of read what you can do in the first game, but there is a decent little game here. A turn can take a while even once you know what you can do, as you assess the benefits of each possibility, but if that is something you like in a game, it is a pretty decent one. Drawbacks include the horrors of the dice: you can get a nice little thing set up and then if your numbers don't hit, you are out of luck.  Also, a lot of different powers to remember, but that is OK by me (ex-CCG player).  I would like to play it again, so despite my horrific dice-rolling prowess, it has some interest.

What can I say? This just fell really flat for me. Where to begin?
1. The iconography on the cards, used I'm sure to save the cost of printing different language versions, is dreadful. It's confusing and doesn't lend itself to quick recognition. So every time you play, you're repeatedly looking up the cards in the glossary. Blech.
2. Because you can only activate your cards based on what numbers you roll up with the dice, you can't really develop much of a strategy. So Roma is sort of a procedural mash up. You roll dice, choose some actions, maybe draw some cards, maybe get some money, maybe lay some new cards. But there's no thrill of accomplishment.

The art on the cards is pretty, and the game isn't broken. Everything "works", but I didn't have any fun.

The art is pretty.

Ok, I tried to say something nice.

This felt like a Scarab Lords (which I also didn't enjoy) or Blue Moon, but those are clearly superior as in this you can only take actions on cards based on the dice that you roll.  

The game felt too constrained and frustrating.  I didn't like how my decisions were made for me.  I also felt that the game had a very frustrating learning curve to know every card and how each card works.  It doesn't help that there are only icons on each card, so you have to look up every card when you get it.  That said the icons are very clear and if you know the game it shouldn't be too much of a problem.  Still, it utilizes one of my least favorite game mechanics which is go through the entire deck and pick the card you want.  This drags the game to a halt (especially if you don't know any of the cards).  Regardless, you always have the option to choose from multiple cards in the middle of your turn so you are looking at serious downtime.

Regardless, I was also quite frustrated by the lack of mobility.  You are not able to move cards around rather only to replace them. 

I can't forsee myself ever playing this again.

Roma is a solid game for two players, albeit a little luck driven.  Fortunately, when the luck favors one player greatly, the game is typically over quickly.  My personal favorite cards are the hunter and the onager, just to keep taking pot-shots at the opponent's buildings and people.

I still like Roma a good bit, though the problem of the Merchant is still an issue.

I bought in a flurry of 2-player game purchases, thinking to play with my wife. This didn't go over well at all with her, but I like this kind of game, where dice are rolled and decisions are made based upon the roll. However, the icons are horrible at conveying information. I guess if I played this all the time that I would learn them, but I don't like that I need to constantly refer to the rules.

It's not that random, even though you do roll dice. The amount of card turnover tests your strategy every turn. The choice of going offense/defense to win is a great feature. A 2-player game you should try.

Upon further review, I'm moving this down to a 6.  It's a decent game, but there is a bit of a learning curve in trying to figure out what all of the cards mean.  Too much conflict for my wife to enjoy it, but a good filler with others.  In my book, the saving grace is that there aren't too many cards that can ever be in play at one time, and having money and victory points as well as a dice mechanic add some nice elements to a card-based game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Impressive (and instant) replay value.  Fun game with a nice interplay of luck and strategy.  Lots of interesting decisions compressed into a short time period and a small, portable package. 

I hope there will be an expansion (i.e. more/different character cards) or at least a place on the official website where the best suggestions for the blank cards are collected.  There is a problem with the Mercator card being overly powerful, but the designer suggests a couple of different fixes in the discussion threads and both work pretty well.

RATING: 7
An enjoyable little game for 2 players that is relatively quick to play and easy to learn the turn mechanics.  The ancient Roman theme doesn't really come through, but to me that doesn't matter - the need to consider card and die roll combinations, and their variety, means there is quite a bit to think about on your turn.  The aim is to have the most Victory Points at the end, generally by not losing those you have too quickly.  My wife thinks it is an OK game, but I liked it - even though she won both initial games ...

RATING: 8
Roma is unpredictable. A game may last 10 minutes or 45; it might be full of devastating attacks, or it might be a non-confrontational race for VPs. Comebacks are possible, unless it's obvious who's going to win; and when that happens, it ends quickly. The unpredictability adds excitement. The skill ceiling is too low for it to be a great game, but it's enjoyable all the same; I probably enjoy it more than the design deserves.

RATING: 10
Similar to Hera & Zeus in terms of the many different card powers but a little more chaotic. Both myself & my wife really enjoy playing this after experimenting for a few plays to see how various strategies play out. Very replayable and still lots of fun after more than 30 plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A fun die-rolling action-selection (sort of ... but you decide the actions = building/character cards you assign to the slots) hand management game. The variety of card powers is reminiscent of CCGs, but of course you have a very limited pool here so it is much more manageable (and balanced?) then a typical CCG. The randomness of the dice may annoy some people, but it may average out over time -- there is a LOT of dice rolling!

By Stefan Feld --  he's been putting out really good stuff for a long time!

--- Summary ---
Place the discs 1-6 in a row in the center, with the coin disc on one side and the card disc on the other. Each player starts the game with 10 VP chits (recommended variant: player 2 starts with 11 VP) and 4 cards. Pass 2 cards to the other player. Starting player places his cards face down oh his side of 4 of the numbered tiles, 2nd player does the same on her side, then flip all cards face up.

On your turn: 
1. Pay 1 VP per empty space on your side of the 1-6 discs.
2. Roll 3d6
3. Take actions in any order:
- play card: pay its cost in coins, place card in any slot 1-6 (discard any cards there already)
- allocate d6 (value = n) to a disc:
... coin disc: take n coins
... card disc: draw n cards; keep 1, return rest to bottom of deck
... disc n: activate your associated character/building. These have a variety of powers (e.g., attack one of the other player's cards (die roll against their defense value), draw/play cards, score/steal VP, etc.).

Take alternating turns until game ends (when VP chit pool -- 36 VP in game -- is empty; finish round, scoring imaginary VP if necessary). The player with more VP wins.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like using dice as your action allocation and it is a fun two player game.  The downside is there are too many types of cards, meaning even after a few plays I had to constantly refer to the rulebook.  Only recommended for serious gamers who want a medium level game, so it has limited appeal.

RATING: N/A
I don't like the game very much. In fact, this game bothers me a bit. The problem is that once a player is on the lead it's very difficult to change it. The starting position (cards and dice luck) is almost everything in the game.
If we admit that both players have exactly the same information about what cards do everything is about getting the right die roll to make them work. No pleasure at all playing it.

I also think that this game is broke.

While it can occasionally be heavy on the luck, the games in which that's true tend to be over in five minutes.  Just start again in those cases - odds are very good the game will be much more balanced, as it usually is.

It's rapidly become one of our favorite "closers" when we have only two players - just perfect if we finish a previous game with a half hour left of game time.

We do play with a variant: we limit cash and drawn cards in a single turn to a maximum of six each, regardless of how many dice you place on either disk.  This does prevent blowouts in those cases where someone consistently rolls higher than the other player.

It's greatest strength is it's short length - that and two small rule adaptations have made almost every single game extremely close (about 4-6 games at this time with variants)

1.  Mercator: 5 Munies to 1 V.P. 
Expensive?  Yes.  But it just works.

2.  Velites and Onager:  Limit strike range to three cards (direct opposite and two adjacent).  Again it just seems to help balance the game.

I bring this game not just to game nights, but almost everywhere.

Fun, fast dice race-game for two. A limit of three actions per turn holds back AP, and there appears to be some scope for pursuing different strategies. The biggest problem is that this scope is limited by the very small number of different cards which grant VP -- it's mostly a game about getting Forums, increasing your chances of getting/activating Forums, and destroying your opponent's Forums. (Don't get me wrong, it's not exclusively about that: it's also possible to go for an early game win by depriving your opponent of VPs, probably with the Mercator. But apart from that it's all about the Forums.)

The components are fine but the use of language-independent icons means that early games will require frequent looks at the reference sheet.

The stand-alone sequel, Arena: Roma II, is a dramatic improvement, with a wider variety of useful cards and with text, rather than icons, to make it easier to pick up and play, so it is recommended over the original. (But they are compatible, so it might be worth owning both.)

[RGG 05 edition] {Roma; dice-rolling, fighting, action-point}  Roma is a tactical 2p game.  It is fast-paced, interactive and fun.  It's all about controlling your and opponent's cards on the board; you have to react wisely for opponent's cards.  "Battle" those dangerous cards away, etc.  There is some luck in the game, occasionally game-deciding. The luck does not bug me.

There is some balance issues about the cards, esp. Mercator.  The Forum is dangerous, but not very imbalanced.  Stefan's or Mike's variant shall be used to make the game more interesting.

The English rules are confusing.  One needs to read the rule questions in BGG to understand them correctly.

in the foot foot library. owned by Funpaul. This one is quite fun, I like all the mechanics that at work. I like the 2 card push at the start of the game. I like the random dice activation system, and for the most part I like the card mix. Except for the Mercator, stall, stall, stall, and keep digging for the Mercator drop him and win that turn. That is how I won my first game and I didn't even know just how good the mercator was. The normal progression of the game is the basis for making the Mercator so good, you simply play the game as you should and when you draw him, you win. This broken card is way more broken than any card in the Jambo deck, and that deck has some broken cards. Pull that card from the deck, or nerf it in some way, and my rating will go up to 8 or 9.

Good game for two players. It's not very long, but despite of several diffrent action cards there is only one strategy that gives you victory. What is more - the luck for cards or dice throws is too important in Roma. Because of that one game can end very fast. I think a way to improve rules is to increase the amount of victory points u can get (it would make it longer). Roma becomes a little boring after few plays, so it's better not to play too often.

A game of hand management and dice rolling. Players use their dice like actions to do various things like gain money, add cards, or perform a special ability on a played card. There is a certain level of randomness to the game, but it feels as though that can be controlled to some extent. The game is all about gaining and losing XP which will ultimately determine the winner.

This was actually a lot of fun, especially the second time around as we learned the cards better.

Now I just need to get my hands on the expansion.

One of the two player games that I would recommend.  There is enough randomness that it doesn't become a complete brain burner which also allows for acceptance of a loss when playing with a spouse.

Simplistic card game that looks heavy but plays like a filler. Just roll the dice, and play cards that are activated. The only real decisions are 'what to buy' and 'where to place it'. We found that the only real way to earn VPs was via the Forums, and winning generally went to the player who rolled the numbers which activated VP generating buildings, or opponent card destroying buildings. Will probably trade this out eventually.

For a game with this much sheer luck, I'm surprised that I enjoy it as much as I do.   But it is what it is, and I find it to be less pretentious than some of Feld's later games heralded for their use of dice "but without injecting too much luck."  Lucky dice notwithstanding, 'Roma' is chock full of tension of the "plan B" sort, i.e how can you turn chicken shit into chicken salad? I think the thematic setting feels perfect for what's going on in the game.

A bit like combining Magic the Gathering with Battle Line, with some clever play possible to put together some good card combinations. I have some concern about whether games will be close or blowouts ... but the game is interesting enough that I expect I'll play it enough times to find out.

But my initial concern remains, as games seem to end in blowout wins as often as they do close victories.

For such a small game, Roma really delivers.  It is an odd Euro that is more Ameritrash than you might think.  Dice, cards, and interaction all over the place.  In fact, I'd say that the game is based on interaction.  

I am sure that there is a way to break the game (actually, I think that is the impetus behind Roma II), but I am not interested in that right now.  I am interested in the quickness of gameplay, and the enjoyment factor that this game carries, and how many ways there are to play this simple game.  

The hardest hurdle to learning the game is remembering what all the icons mean on the bottom of the cards.  If that is the worst you can say about this game, then it must be alright.

Compared to Aton, another Queen game of similar scope and size, this is the better game by far.

So far this game feels limiting because of the dice and cards. I don't mind luck in a game, but often you just can't get off the ground because of bad card draws and dice rolls, so you'll lose quickly if your opponent gets some good stuff early on. Other than that, this is a unique two player game than can be played quickly.

Update 06/20/2012: After getting Arena: Roma II, I would recommend just skipping the original Roma altogether. Arena improves most of the problems with the game because it has better cards and adds the bribery action.

I have only played twice, but I definitely want to play more.  I am almost certain my rating would go up as this is one of the kind of game I like.

I prefer tactical games so I like games where the dice narrow your decisions, but still leave you with good choices. I am always hesitant to play games with lots of variable power cards because of the longer learning curve that this usually promotes. However, the hand sizes aren't large, the cards are simple enough and one has enough time to study them that in this one the learning's not too bad. You really can learn as you go. The older edition with iconography would have scared the bejeezus out of me. 

It not just that I have to learn the game, I don't mind, but I have to teach this to others and that is a real handicap if their is a long learning curve.

Update:  More plays and I do indeed like it better. Up from 7 to 7.5.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 3.5

RATING: 7.5
Has strong replayability so far, as games vary widely in length and successful strategy, depending on the cards drawn.  Some games are defensive affairs, with opponents trying to reduce each other's points to zero, others are completely offense-oriented as you race to collect points.  I don't even mind the lopsided victories and losses, since they are over with quickly.  They make the long back-and-forth games that much more rewarding.

Roma kept getting better through the first 15 plays, as we got to know the deck more.  I'm still enjoying it very much as I near play 25.

Update: Haven't played as much lately, but would still play (though probably not request it).  Roma II will probably see this coming back to the table more, as my playing partners will be excited about the new cards, etc.

Really fun two player game.  Very similar in layout to Battleline, with units arrayed against each other.  However, there are very few cases where head-to-head situations occur.

Mostly, this victory-point based game is about setting up your units for a win while watching your opponent's setup and interdicting where and when you can.

Wow, this is excellent! I was really impressed by Roma, so much so that I played it 3 times in a row that first night. I've since played it 11 times and am still enjoying it. I'm always on the lookout for short two-player games and this fits that niche perfectly. I enjoy short two-player card games like Odin's Ravens, Lost Cities, and Balloon Cup, but I find they sometimes don't have quite enough meat on their bones to feel like I've really played a game. So I've been resorting to short board games like Aton, Fjords, StreetSoccer, Cities, Hey That's My Fish, LOTR Confrontation, and Ubongo: Das Duell. Finally I've started to find card games that work great with just two players, are quick, and have enough interesting decision-making to be satisfying, and they are Scipts & Scribes and Roma. I know I'm a few years late to the party on Roma, but better late than never. This gets added to my list of good Feld games, including Notre Dame. I really like how each turn in Roma can often be played a few different ways, especially since you can activate cards that weren't in play at the beginning of the turn or hadn't even been drawn yet. So you can trigger one card or another card, or push your luck by drawing cards to try to find something even better perhaps, and take some money to play a new card, and trigger the new card by placing it in the perfect spot. I like the feeling of pulling off a neat move in Roma. My only issue is with the end game, which can seem to distort player choices as the victory point supply dwindles and you end up sometimes having to take actions that wouldn't normally make any sense. I can't help but think that different ending conditions such as a set number of turns, a target number of points, or even a set amount of time (like Duel of Ages) might make the game even better, but I should play more before I suggest any rules changes.

The dice rolling makes things feel a bit random, but not too much in this fun card game set in Rome.  Most importantly, the playing dice to activate cards gameplay is just plain fun, and keeps you wanting to come back to this one.  I do recommend taking out the card that turns money into points if you want to avoid a quick broken win for the person that plays it.

First 3 plays and i (we) love it.  A great 2 player game - fast and fun deck-building (but on the table).  Randomness in die rolls works well.  One concern (proto-concern):  not enough ways to acquire victory points (maybe).  Seems like if you don't get a Forum early you may be doomed.  Or we are playing it too much like dual solitaire - maybe the goal should be to destroy opponent's Forum first, then find one of your own?

So far:  love it.

The forum comment above?  Not such a big deal, i think.  You just have to realize that you need to search out a few other cards:  Mercator, or Nero, or...  Things that counter Forum.  I've read it (someone on teh geek) described as a tug-of-war.  It is.  Enjoy the battle.  Bumped up to a 9 with a few more plays.

House Rule: The Architect (and whatever character allows people to be placed for free) should be modified so every card played is reduced to the cost of exactly 1. This way people cannot flood 2 action dice on cards, hoping to find at least one card of a particular color. The third action die will be on the character's power, and the just acquired cards can be built for free. Why ever go for money?

Roma is a great two player game.

"Take that" dice rolling card playing game. Get a good combo of cards down on the table to fit well with your dice rolling, and rake in the points.

Deb won with her Forums, which are very strong. We were playing with the "fix" to the Mercator, which I think I would actually *not* use next time. The fix actually prevented me from catching up to Deb's Forums, by limiting what points I could grab from her.

This game perfectly demonstrates the evils of multi-lingual publishing, the icons are inscrutable. We spent the entire game passing the manual back and forth to try and figure out what cards we were holding.

В принципе игра заслуживает 7.5/10. Снижение из-за плоховатой англизации с немецкого, противоречий (из-за перевода, боюсь) в правилах и нечеткости в текстах абилок карт.

А так редко когда кубиковая игра бывает такая избирательная и увлекательная. Но потолок все ж 7.5 - 8.0/10 из-за фатального рандома. Висишь на грани, не выпало что-то - и гуляй, Вася.

Самые страшные карты - это Меркатор и Гладиатор. Раниий приход Гладиатора и при кубиковом попадании очень сильно
"дырявит" сторону оппонента, расплачивающегося каждое начало хода за дыры своим инфлюэнсом. В результате, идет не развитие, а агония по удержанию на плаву.
Меркатор - совсем читерская карта. Автор игры на форуме сам предложил ограничить ее действие: макс. количество скупаемых инфлюэнсов у оппонента не должно превышать 3 (за 6 сестерций).

Кстати, одну из партий мы как-то лихо свели вничью 18:18 за пять ходов, быстро опорожнив запасы токенов влияния. И в правилах не сказано ни про ничьи, ни про тай-брейк.

Learned and played this a couple times and it was awesome. Roma II (the remake) goes onto my buy list and turns Stefan Feld into one of my favorite designers (after his other successes Notre Dame & Year of the Dragon- now curious to try Rum and Pirates!). This is not particularly like San Juan but in a strange way I think this would appeal to the same crowd- both games have about the same # of different cards with special functions, which is enough to make the game feel satisfying but not too many (e.g. RftG).

2 player Queen; This game's like a knife fight: make one mistake and you're dead.; Rome is in a state of emergency, the Senate and the Guard are embroiled in fierce arguments, the people are divided. Many roads lead to Rome, whether you decide to use powerful cards such as the Tower and the Praetorian Guard to protect the power and victory points you have, or instead prefer to Consul and the Tribune to skilfully pull the strings behind the scenes. Whoever succeeds in using connections and manages to play their cards will at the end deserve their victor's laurels. Also known as: Revolte in Rom; Reworked/Expanded by: Roma II

I'm really likeing this game.  There seem to be a wealth of different stratagies to try, and I enjoy the interaction of the dice.  It takes a while to learn what all the cards do, and I couldn't recomend the play-aid in the files section enough to help with that!

I'm not impressed so far.  When the initial draw gives your opponent a lot of aggressive buildings and gives you a lot of expensive buildings, the game can be over in three turns.  That's highly annoying, and hardly a redeemable characteristic of the game.  I'd play it again to make sure it wasn't just an against-the-odds fluke, but the fact that it can happen at all is terribly annoying.

Roma is great in concept. It does a nice job of marrying dice rolling and card play to create a unique worker placement game that feels more like a tug of war than a race for VP's, atypical for a Feld design. The game allows you to mill through tons of cards, looking for what you need, somewhat reminiscent of Race for the Galaxy. When it works, it is very satisfying. Sadly, it doesn't always work. A strong opening hand can dominate a game and sometimes the dice and cards will conspire to leave you struggling to make any gains at all on your opponent.

I think the core game play is fun enough to rate this an 8 or so, if  I didn't factor in what happens when the randomness works against the game. Sometimes things get lopsided fast, and those games feel random and terrible. Roma II helps a little thanks to the addition of the Bribery space, but it's not enough to stop the game from occasionally going of the rails.

Bit disappointed by the Mercator issue (the lame fix is the omitted cards--never liked a silver bullet approach--and the max 6 "errata" is a kludge).  The system is very unstable, and tends towards runaways.

But the good stuff is good.  There are interesting choices and dilemmas, and some fun planning and plotting going on.  Good game, but needed some further polishing before release. And then Roma II comes along, which is better, but together they look fugly (mostly due to the icons vs text).

Played for the first time recently and boy, it took me some time to get the hang of the cards.  My husband didn't like that aspect at first, but I pointed out that he plays M:tG so it shouldn't be a big deal.  He replied that at least Magic had the card abilities printed at the bottom in written language and not hieroglyphics.  Good point.  Other than that, I think this game has potential - I like the card/dice combination in the game and the variety of choices, though limited by luck of the dice, is enough to keep things interesting.  Rating could (probably will) go up with more plays.

[b]A CARDGAMING TOUR-DE-FORCE, WITH MORE WELL-OILED MUSCLES THAN A BATTLE-HARDENED RETENTUS.[/b]

From the ivory tower populated by the gaming zeitgeist, a cardgame has been lowered by winch to the hungry masses. And they should be grateful. For Roma is absolutely bloody superb.
Someone on the Geek described this masterclass in game design as a "knife fight" and they were spot on the target, with the accuracy of a herioc gladiator's thrown soliferreum. Roma is a brutal melee of a cardgame, that colourfully represents the wrestling of rival powers for control of ancient Rome's senate and guard, by the various toga-wearing movers and shakers that skulked through the collonades of Roman power, daggers in sleeve.

In the box you get a slim pack of attractive cards, filled with langauage-independant iconography, 7 dice, and a jug-full of counters. Not a lot for your hard-earned coinage, but this gem's worth every last shiny penny.

Dice and cards? So this is a random, chaotic, card-flapping, dice-chucking, orgy?
If you thought these thoughts, banish yourself to the colloseum and chase some tigers with trident and net.
Roma is more than the sum of its parts. It is all of those randomish things, but yet it stands taller than merely a card game, or a dice game, or a simple meld of the two. Roma is just great. It uses the dice brilliantly; forcing you to make nail-biting decisions EVERY turn. Each die has to be allocated to a task - and herein lies the blinding design. The dice are the engine that powers the card drawing/playing; allows you cash for further tasks; enables senators, spies, etc, to do their dirty work. The deck of cards is disappointingly small. Initially. Aha! It is slim for a reason, and that reason is game-control. With a fat deck of many wondrous things you could be rolling dice all day to get the cards you want. But with Roma, the card you seek is tantalisingly close. Yes, it is.

The game is a frantic confrontation, with more back and forth than a platter of stuffed olives, carried shoulder-high by a pretty young lad at a consul's banquet. You really will screw the other player over in ways that remind me of Magic: The Gathering, and that is not a comparison I make lightly.

Some whisper that certain cards are unbalanced, and they may be right. But I say, fight and manipulate your way around those cards to victory. No Caesar conquered his people without a ruddy hard wrangling.
Roma allows you to fight back from the brink, if you find yourself losing, in a way that can keep both players on the tips of their sandles, unlike most other 2-player cardgames. It sometimes can really seem like you're windmilling your arms to stop yourself tipping over into the lion's den - games can be that close, swinging wildly. And, you'll always have a great time in the process.

As you may know, I adore swift games; Roma is safetly in the stable with other quick-playing Italian thoroughbreds. You will get many delightful turns of this in before bedtime.

Like all great games, Roma forces each player to manage their resources effectively; management of cash/cards is a skill players will have to master. And you will have to craft a defense right from the get-go, to stem the victory point bleed.
When all is said and done, Roma is a deep game with varied paths to success. I might be naturally programmed to like Roman-themed games, having been born on the Ides of March, but I'm sure that that hasn't clouded my judgement here.

[b]Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus:[/b]

1. Strong, wrestle for control of Rome theme.
2. Excellent artwork.
3. Huge and complex decision trees.
4. Fast gameplay. Did I say fast? As fast as a dagger to the gut fast.
5. Nasty, screw your opponent over to win, wranglings, every blood-soaked turn. This is a good thing.
6. No surefire strategies.
7. Satisfying experience.
8. Simple rules. The permeations that result from all the varied card powers will keep your brain busy, though.
9. Varied paths to victory.
10. Nailbiting finishes.

[b]Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus:[/b]

1. Poor iconography. Don't get me started on icons again!
2. Dice and cards. So, no cubes moved from warehouse to the docks for 3 points on your turn, type euro game. Yes, there is a huge amount of luck in what you pull from the teeny deck of cards, and, obviously what you roll on the dice. But, let me assure you, that the luck can be managed by careful placement of cards to "icons". Clever play will overcome the odds. Plus, you will draw so many cards during your struggle for power, that you should be able to do something to grab a gaunlet full of VPs.
3. Too confrontational for many players.
4. Some gamers feel that certain cards are broken. I do not agree.
5. Some of these same gamers believe that Roma suffers from "first turn advantage". My anecdotal evidence does not support this. You can always penalise the first player by 1 or 2 VPs, I suppose. Or, better yet, make the loser of the last game go first next time.

Roma is an awesome game. Buy it.

Part of me wants to learn how the different cards can work together, but the gameplay itself did not feel compelling enough to interest me in another play.  The high tendency for randomness and the possibility of the game ending in a lopsided win doesn't really help either.  Unfortunately, Roma is a miss for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Roma's an interesting bird.  Normally I don't like a ton of luck in my games but for some reason, the amount in Roma is acceptable.  Maybe because it's quick.  It's certainly addictive, once you have played a couple of times and know what all of the cards do.  A big plus is that each game feels distinctly different (probably due to all of the cards and their interactions).  Zambo likey.

Intense slapfight with some luck of the dice, but much lateral thinking.

After 2+ Plays: I enjoyed my first couple plays, but some of the powers seemed overly powerful.  I'd have to play it more to find out.

Quite good, but too random as for me

Stephen Feld's Worst. Still better then most designers best

A race to build your Empire, and deplete the other players victory tokens. Either through tactical card play or manipulation. A brilliant slugfest and tug-o-war where you need to hit hard from the word go.

Nice relaxing two player slugfest.

Feld made a filler for us! And playable on the bed as well :) Again, too random sometimes, but it plays nice.

Chaos and fun rule the day here. The game is very addictive, and once you internalize the symbols on the cards, the game turns flow quickly. Has a wonderful mix of American and German design sensibilities.

1/1/12 -- This game basically finished running its course once we figured out how good the Mercator was.  Well, it was a fun ride, but the game's now long gone.  Reducing rating to 7.

7/10/06 - Rating 8:  I've played Roma 5x so far and it's really tickling my fancy.  This game is kind of an ode to dice, and, though I have no idea if the game is totally random or not at this point, it is certainly tons of fun, win or lose.

Coloca tus cartas frente a las losetas de dados. Usa tus dados para activar tus cartas (y dañar a tu adversario), conseguir más cartas o conseguir dinero. El juego termina cuando alguien pierde todos sus PV.

I don't like the concept of Forum cards

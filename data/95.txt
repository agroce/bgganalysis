My favourite game to play with my daughter at the moment. She is grasping the strategy well. The problem is though the game can be very stressful for her, with lots of blocking and moving hedghogs into pits. I have to keep encouraging her to play, not one of her favourites at the moment.

I want to like it more, especially since there are so many different games in the box... but there&#039;s not a lot you can do to mitigate bad die rolls and the main game is quite repetitive.

RATING: 4
This is yet an old classic that I have wanted to try for a while; not that I thought it would be a great game, but rather because I love trying new games, and I feel that I need to have played many of those old classics (at least it’s a classic game here in Denmark). Having now played it twice, I can safely say that I do not need to play it again…

It’s a very basic game whose problem is that it takes around 45 minutes with 6 players, which I think is the best number, though I suspect 5 or maybe 4 would be okay too. With fewer players it loses a lot of the charm and strategy. On your turn you roll a die and then have to decide if you want to move one of your visible hedgehogs and then you move any hedgehog in the row corresponding to the die roll – yes, that’s more or less the entire game! Obviously there is a bit more to it, and you can make some sneaky moves or try to place the other players’ hedgehogs in the tar which cripples them, but there are way too few interesting decisions considering it takes 30-45 minutes to play (with 6). I played it twice and actually made it to the finals - but I didn't want to participate, which I think says everything about how I feel about the game...

This is a cute little racing game with cute hedgehogs and a cute gameboard and...did I mention it was cute?

The base game is pretty random.  The game came with a bunch of variants though, so I think I'd like to print out some translations and try to use some of those in the future.  The base game is simple enough that introducing a few more rules (in the form of a variant) isn't a big deal.

I'm just not a fan of dice-based race games.  Except this one I kinda like.  Rating raised from 6 based on further plays, especially across variants.  Raiting may go as high as 7,5 in further plays.

The moves are obvious - avoid the pits and try to climb over others while avoiding them climbing over you (not that you have much control over that) - so it all comes down to the luck of the dice.  But it captures the theme of racing hedgehogs in a fun way and it moves quickly.  There are also a great number of variants that can add spice to future playings.  The artwork is charming.  I am particularly amused by the picture of the hedgehog in the pit on the space before the finish in the "6" row.  He's saying, "Ich hasse dieses Spiel!" - ("I hate this game!") - which is what you might be thinking if one of your disks is in that pit!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A chidren's racing game with quite a lot of incentive for nasty play and learning the value of tactical and strategical manoeuvring. I've played this game with 6 players to date (where the board is simply too full for things to be fun) and 3 (where you can maneuver too much and thus increasing the luck of the die throw). There is a clear optimum of players here. This is not a game I would want to play all the time (certainly not with adults), but it's not totally stupid either. 

As this is a children's game, it will acquire no rating, but it is in my limited experience one of the better games out there.

The rules are simple - move one of your hedgehogs sideways if you wish, then move any hedgehog forward in the row that matches what you rolled on the die.  And a second die and double your fun.  But watch out for the pits, which will keep you stuck until everyone else catches up!

Super-light, this would be perfect for kids when you want to teach spatial logic and reasoning.  Even adults will end up befulddled as they try to puzzle out the best move each turn.  The more players you have, the more insane it will get.

OK, there is something about racing hedgehogs that makes this game a hoot. Plus, the game has a huge number of variants that all lend something to game play. We like to use the doping variant where the first hedgehog across the finish line had to be on drugs, so is eliminated from the game. It's light and fun.

RATING: 3
Roll and move of sorts. That's not entirely fair though, as you have a choice of moving one of your pieces vertically prior to the forced move based on the die roll. 

This is a racing game where each player has four (I think?) tokens they are moving horizontally across a racetrack. There are about six rows, with pits scattered among the board. Tokens moved onto a pit are stuck there temporarily. First player to get three of his tokens to the finish line wins. 

Way too long for what it is.

This is a simple race game. Each player gets four hedgehogs and places them one at a time on one of the starting squares of the six tracks. The length of the tracks are only nine spaces counting the beginning squares. It's a short race but it's not an easy race. At the start of your turn you roll a die. Each row is numbered and you have to move a hedgehog in the row corresponding to the die roll, regardless of who it belongs to. Before you move you can move any hedgehog you own one space to the right or left. You can move onto other hedgehogs and block them from moving. There are blocking squares scattered over the board that freeze the hedgehogs in them until everyone has passed or drawn even to their position. The winner is the first to get three of their hedgehogs into the last row. This game comes with forty different variations that can make it much more strategic or just different. Fun for any age group. Even my three year old likes to play with the pieces.

Cute, backgammon like game of racing hedgehogs along a simple gridded board. The track is six lanes wide, each line matching up to the roll of a die. After rolling a die, you may change lanes with one of your hedgehogs, then move a hedgehog in the lane rolled. First to get three of their four hedgehogs to the finish line wins. Tons of variants on the Doris and Frank website, too!

An adorable and amusing hedgehog racing game for 2-6 players. I first became aware of this game from a thread a couple months back about favourite roll-n-move games and I was instantly smitten with the unusual theme and the look of the hedgehogs. In person the hedgehogs are even cuter and the wooden pieces larger and chunkier than I expected. During a turn, you roll a die, optionally move any of your hedgehogs one row left or right, then move any hedgehog (not necessarily yours!) forward one space in the row you rolled. Avoid the black pits as any hedgehog caught there can only move when he is in last place. First to get 3 out of 4 of their hedgehogs to the goal is the winner! There is a book included (translated rules available in the Files section as the game is only available in German) with [b]forty(!)[/b] variants for different play experiences – from 'Carom' to 'Doping'! :D Also the game board is double sided which adds to the variety. Love the unique theme and the awesome components, and looking forward to trying out many of those variants (some of them are not suitable for 2 players) over the course of the life of this game. 

Overall I thought it was a cute and fun little game, that works well and plays fast with 2 players, but it can be slightly draggy near the end if most of your racers are at the goal and you get stuck with the others - you can't move sideways because you've got a pit next to you and can't move any piece forward because you don't roll the correct row. There's always a few rounds near the end where my opponent and I have a 'roll off' because neither of us can make a sensible move.

First played August 1st, 2007.  It's a quick learn (<5min) however it takes more than 45 minutes to play.  For what it is, that seems a bit too long for me.  There is a decent balance of strategy and luck in the game.  You have for hedgehogs that you are trying to get to the end of the track, however there are oil traps along the way that cause you to get stuck until everyone catches you.  You can easily get covered up and forced to wait until uncovered to move.  I don't know if I'd recommend this as a play.  It was fun to play once, however it seems there are other games that are more worthy of repeat game plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
So what?  Igel Argern is a dice/racing game that doesn't really have a whole lot to it other than occasionally making a decision to lateral one of your hedgehogs to somewhere safer or decide which pile of hedgehogs to move another one a top.  It's not that bad I suppose, but I just don't see myself ever really asking to play this game again anytime soon unless with a handful of the some hundred variants.  There are better dice games out there for sure.

The first impression was so nice. Unlike the usual racing game, however, Igel Argern provides different fun and feeling on racing mechanic. The game aspect is not an exciting gallop ever. Actually the game is full of irking and annoying situations. The pace of racing is very slugguish. For me, I don't like too much this kind of racing game.

Opinions pretty varied on this one, with most liking it though so looks like I am in the minority on this one. I thought the game was painfully slow and super tedious, and I see others say it is much more fun if you play it "quickly" so there is good advice as my game was not (but really you are limited by the dice so I'm not sure how to really speed it up other than to literally play in a rush, its not like there is any AP, there isn't). 

I also found it WAY too luck based, roll a dice, if your piece is in that lane great, if not too bad move someone elses piece... Oh boy this is fun and oooo the strategy, should I move sideways to avoid a barrier, hmmmm that's a tough one...yawnnnn 

I don’t even think I can recommend this one for kids its just too slow and really it should have been half the length.  For this kind of race game the Hare & Tortoise game is better (but not that great either imo). I guess you have to approach this one with the right mindset, its cute and light?

Online play at Brettspielnetz.de & finally FTF. Clever little roll-and-move that's worth playing for gamers as a short passtime. I like it best with only two players as the risk of moving in front of a pit is more manageable. With the full set of six, it might become rewarding as well as an exercise to dis single players.

Fun little game, a lot of luck from the dice, but manageable, with room for clever play.  I like the artwork.  For the game to work, players must take very quick, almost instantaneous, turns.  In my mind this is a quick, light, racing game, and analysis just bogs it down and sucks out the fun.

Weird race game with pitfalls and moving each other's pieces, like multiple games of Elefantenparade spilling into each other and with options heavily restricted by the roll of the die. Should probably be played quickly, as many turns will leave you no choice, or perhaps even no move at all. For some reason I can't stop thinking you should be able to step over another piece in a pit.

First edition.
Second edition has a double sided board and different characters of hedgehogs.

Difficult to rate. I thought the best player would win most games but this doesn't seem to be the case. IMO plays should be about decreasing the winning percentage of the player that is in the lead. 

If you have the choice between a first and a second edition I would definately opt for the second.
There are some 40 variations of this game. I rate my edition currently a seven. I want to try some of the variations

It is possible to play this game using the icehouse pieces. Or simply the pieces of can't stop.

I don't have to tell you that if you like the game you are better of with a real edition of the game. Can't stop is more fun to me with the stopsignboard

This is a fun little game system.  With over 40 variants and different ways to play, this can be a different game every time...and there's always the hedgehodge carom!  The basic game isn't extremely dynamic or exciting but adding in variants and other options definitely spice up the game.  Basically, you roll the die, have the option to move one of your available hedgehodges to a different lane (if available) and then move one hedgehodge in the row whose number was rolled forward one space.  One space in each row has a barrier which prevents passage until all other hedgehodges in the game are at least caught up to its position.

1 game, 6 players (possibly too many) with doping varient.

This basic race game requires significant house rules to make interesting.  On this occassion I think most of the house rules were motivated by a need to improve the game and breathe life into it rather than a love of the basic game. Admittedly, the get stuck in the pit and consequent get out of the pits rules are a nice touch but the need for such an array of house rules means that the base game feels half thought / incomplete.

Egelrace - New in collection june 2008

Easy family style game, works better with more than 2. It's one of the simplest "Frank & Doris" game I have, good as a short "take that" filler. Mix of luck & tactics.

NL: soort "egel-erger-je-niet" race waarbij je elkaar niet eruit gooit, maar jouw egels bij voorkeur op die van anderen zet (zodat alleen jouw egels bewogen worden), en je andermans egels alleen vooruit wilt zetten als ze daarmee in een valkuil lazeren. Leuk tussendoortje. Vast ook leuk voor kids vanaf een jaar of 7.

I really like the box, the boards, and the pieces. Unfortunately the game itself is dull, and no combination of the myriad variants has thus far made it otherwise (the five column board with turbo hedgehogs #1 at least shortens play a bit, while adding some welcome decision-making). Traded (if I had more storage space I probably would have kept it).

First impression: Really simple dic game with quite limited options what you can do on your turn. The dice can fail you in this game. Not a deep game but a nice filler and playing it is fun.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Light but not mindless race game driven by dice in which three of each player's four hedgehogs (it could have been tea mugs as well but that wouldn't really fit Doris & Frank that well) must reach the goal as quickly as possible. 

The point here is that the value thrown on the die each turn doesn't indicate how far to move with one piece but which of the six lanes of the board contains a piece (own or any rivals') to be moved one space forward; before each of these moves any own piece can change a lane. Progress is braked by several traps (each lane has got one) that keep pieces stuck there until they're last.

Being still strongly influenced by luck, the tactics of Igel Ärgern are pretty much on the surface for all to see: it's important to stay flexible in order to use as many throws as possible (even forcing your opponent to move in your favour), so is to avoid traps as well and last but not least to block rival pieces or even stacks, mostly by changing lanes at the right moment.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
It sadly turns out to be little more than a dice fest with limited options open to you and the best move mostly obvious. The aim is to get 3 of your 4 hedgehogs first over the finish line. The racetrack is 5 lanes wide. Your go consists of rolling a die, moving any one of your hedgehogs sideways, then moving any hedgehog in the lane denoted by the die (6 is wild) one space forwards. Hedgehogs stack up on a space and only the top can move - so it's good to land on someone, bad to be landed on. On each lane there's one black pit space - get stuck in there and you have to wait until ALL other hedgehogs are past you before you can move again. Generally it's the kiss of death, so get into another lane fast if you're getting close as people will lunge at the chance to throw you in.

One saving grace for the game is that there are something like 40 variants that come with it so the perfect form maybe somewhere out there.

Homemade copy.  My rating went up significantly after playing more than twice.  Quite fun if played quickly and nastily.

I think that's why my initial impression was rather low.

Uh, are there more charming games than this? I don't really think so.

What you have here is pretty much the perfect minimal design for die-rolling. There's dealing with probability, there's goofiness, there's plenty of screwage opportunity, there's thrills, there's spills.

Kind of unbelievable amounts of fun for 3 rules and a die.

Bájos játék, aranyos komponensekkel. Alapvetően egy dobj és lépj játék pár érdekes mechanizmussal megbolondítva. Elsőre rögtön bevezettünk pár kiegészítő szabályt amelyek egész jól működtek. Elolvasva a verziókat, össze fogok állítani pár csomagot amelyeket kilehet majd próbálni a jövőben.
A hatos táblán és úgy, hogy a kezdő játékos dob annyi kockával ahányan játszunk és mindenki választ 1 darabot belőle, illetve az 1-6 között is lehet mozogni verzióval a játék határozottan jobb lett. Egy pontot kúszott felfelé az értékelésem.
Az utolsó parti a következők kombinációban zajlott. 6 széles pálya, kezdőjátékos dob annyi kockával ahányan játszunk és mindenki választ 1-et belőle, a fekete mezőkbe egy süni eshet bele a többiek átugorhatnak felette és csak akkor jöhet ki ha már nincs senki mögötte a sorban, ha egy játékos nem tud saját bábúval oldalirányban lépni, akkor választhat ellenfelet is erre a cselekedetre, a játék elején titkosan választunk egy süni típust és a játékvégi pontozásnál minden ilyen típusú beért süni +1 pontot ér. Ezek után a játék már 8-ast érdemel, hihetetlen mennyire sokrétű.

I had wanted this game for a long time simply for the cute hedgehogs on the discs.  However, the base game (we have yet to try any of the expansions) was also a lot of fun for us.

Fortunately, my five year old likes this one enough to ask me to pull it out every now and again.

An interesting roll-and-move game that actually has a little bit of strategy, but is quite accessible due to the simple ruleset. There's really a nice press-your-luck mechanic in perhaps placing your men in the line of fire behind a black square where they might get stuck. I like the variant where the board wraps around and having only five columns so that you get a little bit more control over your pieces.

[Doris & Frank 2nd (1997) edition] {Kid, animal; roll-and-move, pawn-stacking; optimal 4p} {adult 5, kid 7} It is a nice family and children game. It is very easy to learn. It is interactive and can be nasty :P Even though dice is used, it is a tactical game; luck is fairly strong but not a critical factor.

Replayability is good because there are so many variants. However, some variants are obviously artificial and weak. I prefer the following variants: "5 Column Hedgehogs", and "Hedgehog Spies".

It has funny bits; I esp. like that each pawn has its illustration. The board is too thin, not durable. It's a shame that it's only available in German. I really would like an official English rule (the translation is complete but I want some illustration).

Simple but tricky race game. Plenty of laughs. Progress can falter near game end. Lots of variants to explore.

A pretty nice roll and move game where your pieces can stack up with your opponents' pieces. And yes, they're hedgehogs.

Good: Racing hedgehogs is a fun theme. The number of variants is amazing. Good amounts of player interaction.

Bad: You roll and you move.

The hedgehogs may be in a hurry, but I won't be rushing to play this one again anytime soon. A bit dull, plodding and abstract for my tastes ...

Cute race game can be chaotic with lots of people which I see as a good thing BTW.  Still you are can also be made to feel like you have no control at all and there are better cute race games...like Snails Pace Race.

Has been compared to Backgammon, but with one die and little choice this is no Backgammon.

A gem of simplicity and fun. Add the variants of "doping" and "cylindrical map" and you have a winner. For hedgehog fanatics add the "marathon" variant! Doris and Frank gave us another wonderful family game.

It was luck-heavy with only a couple interesting decisions, but there was some fun interaction and at least some small amount of strategy. I see it as a fun family game, but probably not anything I'd use my "strategy gaming time" on.

This is a cute roll and move game.  I played a variant, so don't take my rating too seriously.  It was cute, though.

Another good silly racing game. Like the rules say, 4 is probably best. 6 is too many. Someday I'd like to try all the variants, and there are many scores of them. Fizzy Lifting really improves the game, while Doping is good for laughs.

A &#039;take-that&#039; type game as opponents chant &quot;pit, pit, pit&quot; and your pawn hits the pit. Jolly good fun.

Очень быстрая, незаумная, казуальная игра. Идеально под пиво с орешками и непринужденную болтовню компашкой человека в 3-4. Большой рандом, который в данном случае больше плюс, чем минус. Если каждому дать по собственному кубику, то партия длится минут 10.

Doris Matthäus & Frank Nestel; Loosely translated as "Hedgehogs in a Hurry", this game gives players several wooden disks (the hedgehogs) to place in one of six rows. During a turn, you roll a die, move any of your hedgehogs one row left or right, then move any hedgehog in the row your rolled forward one space. But watch out for black spaces; hedgehogs caught there can't continue moving until they're in last place. The first player to get three hedgehogs to the end of the board wins. Some later versions of this game come with dozens of different variants to keep the game interesting. Also known as Egelrace

Deceptively light race game, which is (for the most part) dice-driven.  Not bad, but nothing outstanding, either.

Igel Ärgern is one of the best family gateways I have encountered. Easy, yet different enough from the commonly known roll&moves. An absolutely hidden gem. Gorgeous graphics, too.

Racing game relied mostly on the roll of the die and the good grace of the others.  It's actually kind of fun.

RATING: 6
There's a spine of strategy to it, but it's mostly tactical.  It most reminds me of Lotus, in that trapping your opponents' pieces is key, and if all your pieces are trapped, you just watch the game go by until you're liberated, and probably lose at that point.  Unlike Lotus:  Pieces always move one space forward at a time.  A die determines which line must have a piece move, even if it's an opponent's piece.  There are pits to detain your pieces until they're tied for last place.  Your choices are definitely limited, but there are choices to be made... usually.

After 1 Play: I thought this was a neat little racing game that just outstayed its welcome.  We played with 5 or 6 players and I think that may have played a part, so if I try it again I'd probably stick with 3-4 people.

A good race game that takes a bit long. I can certainly recommend the variants that are included in the rules.

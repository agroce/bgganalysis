I like this one somewhat, but in general, it doesn't stand out. To be sure, it has an elegance about it, is very easy to explain and plays really fast. And it's good fun with enough strategy to keep me thinking. So pretty solid thumbs up on those counts. But my main strike against is those blasted plastic gems. I wish it had better components in that area. It also doesn't serve up alot of excitement, so I don't reach for it on the shelf.

After only one playing.  I'm not a fan of abstract games, and although there is a theme, it doesn't feel like much of one.  However, I do like this game.  There is blind guessing involved which I usually don't like, but it works in this game because it is "educated" guessing.  The rules are simple.  I'd play this often.

RATING: 7.5
Based on what I had read about the game, I wasn't really all that interested in Basari: but now I've played it! An outstanding game. The rules are fairly easy and it takes far less than an hour to play, but it feels and plays like a much deeper game. In spite of the dice, I would argue that it is NOT dominated by luck, but requires shrewd judgement and a good understanding of psychology to out-negotiate your opponents. Speaking of opponents, there is a danger of analysis paralysis right in the middle of haggling, depending on whom your opponent is.

RATING: 6
Basari is a neat take on roll and move. The design itself is basically good, but a bit swingy and thematically dry.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Perfect! Simple rules. Plays quickly. Lots of player interaction. You have to keep any eye on what other players want to do (like Adel Verpflichtet). But it adds a deliciously tough negotiation element too. 

There are also opportunities for defensive play (deliberately choosing an action to block 2 other players from entering into negotiations which could affect your lead in a category)

My 10 year old niece considers it her favourite game. 

I have the original German version which is very attractive, and the Out The Box version. This serves as a backup copy and is useful for introducing the game to the general public.

Played once with 3. It was a very close game and I was consigned to second place on the final die roll, which I don't have a problem with because often such finales are exciting and agonising; good things in a game. 
However, as a whole, I didn't find Basari exciting or agonising.

What a fun little game!  Not much downtime, as even gem trades you are not involved in are fun to watch, and the game plays very quickly.  Excellent production and board, with everything you need to know in view at all times.  It isn't as "light" as it looks, even with the dice factor.

RATING: 4
It seems to be about predicting what other people will predict other people will do.  Well, that doesn't work too well; it seems more like noise.  It appear that you can probably build up some statistical best odds approach, but the gameplay simply isn't interesting enough to commit the time to optimize a technique.

RATING: 8
Basari is a fast paced fun paper/rock/scissors type game where the art of negotiation generally determines the winner.  It is easy to teach new gamers, but deep enough to keep the old pros happy as well.  The decisions created when bartering begins can be intense and always very important.  If you are a fan of Settlers of Catan or Bohananza, give this one a closer look.

RATING: 9
This is strongly liked by at least 3 people in our circle, and it gets frequent outings when we are looking for something fun and short. Strangely enough it seems to appeal both on evenings when we are in the mood for something lighter, or something meatier. Plays well with 3 and 4, might actually prefer it with 3 as no-one benefits from a lock-out on 3 matched cards. And certainly one that suits my love for daft let's-see-if-this-works game plans. It's amazing what I have gotten away with over the years.

  p: I think this could well be my favourite bidding game. I have read that some people start bidding low and keep upping the ante til someone drops out. I guess the reason I like this game so much is because our group is pretty evenly matched and most of the fun comes from making the one opening bid that your opponent can neither afford to take or reject. My best loved games are always full of dilemma's and presenting certain opponents with potential win-or-lose choices is grand. Combined with a healthy dose of guessing, bluffing and counter-guessing when deciding on your  [BGG gremlins ate the rest of my commment]

This played a lot faster than I thought it was going to. People who like negotiation and dice rolling and who dis themes as "pasted on" should love this. It's plays like a sort of super filler. It's light and relatively quick, but still enough game there to feel substantial. Quite satisfying to barter your way to victory against your opponents.

RATING: 8
Ever wonder what it would feel like to live through the "Battle of Wits" in the Princess Bride?  This game will give that to you in spades.  Players will find themselves going back and forth trying to figure out what their opponents will play, and you only have 3 options to choose from.  It's amazing how much thought people will put into a single decision each turn.  In fact the game could almost be prone to analysis-paralysis because players will sometimes take the time to count gems each player holds and go through multiple different scenarios in their heads.

But that's what makes this game great.  To do those mental gymnastics and calculate out your best possible action, and then find that 2 other people chose the same thing, so you get nothing.  It's highly strategic and yet you're held captive by the whims of the other players.  This is a game that I find myself loving more and more each time I play, and I often think about it afterwards, which I think is the mark of a really good game.  That's quite impressive from a game that will only take 30 minutes to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very nice balance of luck and strategy. Many options with 3 or 4 players. Do you want to race and force the end of round with a 10 point bonus? Will that save you from having to barter? You think you know what people are goign to do, well, wait and see!

RATING: 8
I have to admit, when I saw roll-and-move and an odd bidding/bartering scheme, I was skeptical about the game's fun value.  A few plays have quickly changed me into a believer.

Play moves along very quickly, and the three rounds seem to just fly by.  Role choice (gems, points, or dice) is incredibly fun and strategic; I found myself constantly having to keep an eye on my opponents, and factoring their landing space into my choice.  Sometimes you want to help yourself, sometimes you'd prefer to sabotage them.  And, most importantly, the bartering events are FUN.  This is definitely the best aspect of the game; and since the theme is built entirely around bartering, the game just seems to sing.  I highly recommend that you check out this semi-filler.

RATING: 4.5
An unsatisfying, abstract filler game that is very luck heavy and feels stripped down to the bare essentials.  Okay for kids, non-gamers and novice gamers.  The game mechanics include roll-and-move, simultaneous action, and stock holding (majorities).  On a few rare occasions, there's a bit of rock-paper-scissors and negotiation (when 2 or more players land on the same space).  Strategy-wise, it certainly helps to keep an eye on how many gems of a particular color you need in order to lock the majority because the gem "pools" do run out.  As the gems run out, the strategy becomes linear (boring) as players just race to their start spaces (via die rolls) hoping to get the bonus for ending the round.

Sidebar:  If you like the psychological angst of the rock-paper-scissors element in Basari, I suggest trying Goldbrau (where R-P-S is used each turn).

Chaotic, not full of luck, but has a few cool things I like: simultaneous action, bartering and even though there ARE dice involved, its not a simple roll and move type game (although it is simple).

RATING: 5
A very interesting design in that players are moving around a track, with each space on the track offering a different amount of points or gems.  Players simultaneously decide what sort of action they want to take based on the space they are on, and it's generally better to select an action that someone else didn't take.  So, you evaluate what you think everyone else will choose vs. what you would like to choose.

Difficult decisions to make all the time and plenty of player interaction.  Has gotten stale after multiple playings, though

I had lots of fun playing this fast paced game! It is very easy to learn, knows no waiting time, lots of direct player vs player interaction, and plays within 20 minutes.

Simple simultaneous action selection, like found in Klaus Teuber's "Adel Verpflichtet" or Reiner Knizia's Rome/Imperium. Do you go for 2nd best or do you pay a price to reap the 1st prize? Knowing how much each prize is truly worth is the question in this magnificient game.

Not a terrible game.  Fast paper, rock, scissors game.  Not any big decisions.

How many games play brilliantly with three? Not many but this one does. Each player can pick one of three actions and each player must outthink the others in their choice.

The original reworking of Adel Verpflichtet, later reworked again into Edel, Stein und Reich.

Basari is basically a rock - paper - scissors game where you attempt to gain majorities in different gem colours so that you can score more points at the end of each scoring round. Everyone secretly selects actions ala Adel, and then reveals. If no one else picked the same action as you, you do it, if someone else has you have to negotiate.

The negotiation process is somewhat silly though, because all you're generally doing is dumping useless gems, which only solidifies majorities and keeps the score tight.

The difference between this and Edel is the board and the use of the die in place of the special ability cards. I liked the special cards more and dislike the die, so this is a 5 to Edel's 6.

Fast, filler, but there are many better choices out there in this niche.

Picked up in September 2007.

Nice, simple negotiation game.  Seems that wife and sister don't like negotiation games as much.  In time maybe.  It takes practice.  Should get this out more for the kids though.

August 2009 - Learned the single die roll variant from Heath today.  Excellent suggestion since it eliminates the variability of each player's die roll.  This game just gained some additional ranking from me.  (from 7 to 7.25).  Now we will see if I can get it played within the family.

For me, this was everything that similar simultaneous action selection games (Shipwrecked, Hoity Toity) are lacking.  A player will always get something each turn, which prevents a runaway leader problem.

The heart of the game lies in deal-making, which has a structure to keep the game on track.  Each deal could affect multiple players, so wheeling-and-dealing sometimes involves multiple voices!

Is this a great game or what? My edition is the new Out-of-The-Box version.  It has great components (I especially like the glass beads used for the gems).  Multiple strategies make this abstract strategy game very fun.  I am starting to feel like it&#039;s the heavy strategy game in the light strategy game&#039;s clothing, so to speak.  Can suffer from an kingmaking situation in the last round of play, and there is a slight downtime if you are not involved in a gem trade.  Otherwise great!

Why people consider this a rock, scissors, paper game is a mystery to me... I wish I had known about the alternative rules (I.E. only one person gets the 10 pt around the board bonus and the single roll for everyone&#039;s movement), it may have affected my rating (making it a 10 instead of a 9).

This has to be one of my most played games. Must be played with variant where all players move with a common die roll or there is too much luck, and the balance of choices is lowered. Without the common die roll, the value of choosing to roll the die is too low.

A simple auction game where bluffing and doublethink play an important role.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Some bluffing, some dice rolling, set collecting and lots of bartering/negotiation. I'm not a great fan of negotiation games, but this is pretty simple "raise your offer" stuff. I'm also not a great fan of bluffing or "roll and move" games. So why don't I mind this game? I'd like to try the supposedly streamlined card game version (Edel, Stein & Reich).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Have the original verion.  I like the variant that forces everyone to use the same die result.  I think the kingmaker problems can be avoided by not putting yourself in the position to be harmed by it, which does take planning and skill.

Nicely balanced 45 minute game where players play chips to determine what action they want to take.  A bluffing game that works very well and doesn&#039;t overstay its welcome.

RATING: 6
I go back and forth on this one.  Sometimes I like it a lot, sometimes I'm underwhelmed.  Edel, Stein, & Reich is more interesting in some ways, but also can be more random (especially with 5 players, which Basari doesn't support).  Basari with 3 players is surprisingly quick, and perhaps that's the best way to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The best part of this negotiation game is that the offer-counteroffer system has clear structure and obvious limits to values. A bit random (because of dice and the simultaneous action selection), but that prevents paralysis and overanalysis.

It's a fun game with somewhat interesting decisions.  However, the whole process feels very repetitive and the replay value of this game is very low in my opinion.  Also, you need 4 players for this game to be fun.  3 doesn't work, and the game doesn't support 5, so this is a severe limitation in my opinion.

RATING: 6
Based on my first play (with 4 players), I think I'd give this an 8. It might possibly move up or down - I'm not yet sure how much the die rolls annoy me.

After second play: Had a terrible problem with kingmaking at the end there. Between the two people negotiating, we could decide who would win. Either of us could select the other as the victor, but neither of us could select ourself.

I don't really enjoy the doubleguessing genre much. This does it well, with the negotiation, but it's still true that the person who guesses best is likely to win.

This game is never as fun for me as it is for my husband, which is a shame.  I seem to have trouble grasping games with multiple paths to victory. In Basari, players have a choice of going for gems, points, or ending the game quickly to get bonuses.  I am constantly second guessing what seems like easy decisions for everyone else in my group and as a result feel like I never make the right choice.  Not sure what to do to get better at this game, and until I do, I think it will continue to be just 'eh' to me.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I prefer the variant in which one die roll is used to determine the movement of all pawns.  The 10 points available each round for making a complete circuit are essential to winning, and they shouldn't be awarded based on lucky rolls.  0-6

Family Gaming: This is a more traditional family style gaming experience, except for the bartering. Not everyone likes to barter, so the game falls somewhere between a family game and a strategy game, but may not appeal completely to either group. I like it, because it is easy to teach and learn.

Sort of a hybrid auction-negotiation game.

While you could treat it as a straight up auction game, seems to work best if you play with people who will try to convince the other player that the bid is a good deal for both players.

RATING: 7
Decent game with simple rules that must be followed in order to fully appreciate; for example, we did not realize that the first piece to make a lap gets 10 points which made a certain card more important (we had an immediate paradigm shift when we realized what we did wrong). BTW: We are going to implement players placing gained gems behind screens so as to make the game more competitive for players who cannot make quick calculations when bartering; otherwise, seeing each other's gems can lead to analysis paralysis.

RATING: 6
* Played 15+ times. The graphics are a bit drab, but the bigger problem is that the gems on the market spaces are too small to see easily, and blue and green look alike. This has been a problem with several playings of this. Also, cheap Chinese production pales compared to German production. Still, the cheap production equals a cheaper price. As a game, it is very good, but Edel, Stein, & Reich, with it's varying bonus cards, has a bit more "spice" to it; and the visuals in ESR are so much clearer that. Still Basari is a great game at a great price, and is very family friendly. ((Bought from ?; got rid of because I have ESR.))

RATING: 5.3
I've had a hard time getting it to the table because it has just never looked as interesting to me as many of my other games, probably because I am not an enthusiast of barter games. I have owned it for several years.

It looked easy and short, so while we were waiting for others to arrive, we played.

Everyone liked it better than I did, although I won't mind playing it again, especially as a filler game.  With four people and reading the instructions, it took only half an hour.

Each round you roll the dice and move, then choose 1 of 3 actions.  In a 4 player game, if another has chosen the action, you bater with one another until an agreement is reached; If 3 choose the same action, none of the 3 takes the action--I lost almost all rounds to that, and therefore was a little bored with the game.  I wasn't rolling the dice well, and I was reading my opponents poorly.

A gamer's game when you're in the mood to just be playing.  Fun, simple and quick.  The trading rules in this game are so clear cut that you wonder why they weren't poached for all those other unending too free-for-all trading rounds (hello Civilisation).  Lots of fun and one of those that when it's over, you want to play again right away.

Wasn't really impressed, but as filler, it's okay.  It's all about trying to predict what the other players are doing while they're trying to do the same.  There's also bargaining thrown in, but it just droned on.  The game would be better if played very quickly, so you don't have time to agonize over the hundred different ways each trade can turn out.  You can certainly optimize each play, but the game is too random to be doing much of that.

One of the best negotiation games I own. It plays quickly with more bluffing than chance going into the randomness.

This game is a lot of fun.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fairly easy game to play, with some player negotiations.  There is some luck involved (die rolling to move your pawn), and everyone gets to pick one of three actions (hidden via the use of a card) to determine which action you will make (if two players selected the same action, the need to negotiate to determine who will get to do the action, but if there are three or more who picked the same card, none get to do the action).

At the end of each of the three rounds (moving your pawn around the board), majority is checked for each type of gem, and points are awarded.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I'd have to play them back-to-back to be sure but I think I like this a bit more than Edel. The best part (the negotiation) is exactly the same while everything else is streamlined and quicker moving. To me that's ideal for a game of this weight. I think both games are growing on me.

What an unusual game.  The combination of roll-and-move and blind bidding makes it feel a little old-fashioned to say the least (and so it is--published in 1988).  The game is probably better than that description makes it sound, though; the more interesting decisions come in the bidding of gems, when it is necessary to calculate how much you can offer without giving your opponent an advantage in gems of any color, and in particular what counter offer will be made.  

I wasn't that engaged in it--I'd be willing to try it again, since there does appear to be a game in here, but it simply didn't really grab my interest. (1 play)

I like this game, but there is a king-making aspect to it if one or two players in a four-person game are not very good at bartering.  My husband and I play it sometimes with "Crazy Don," who is an imaginary player.  We shuffle up his Gem, Dice, and Number cards, and pick one randomly each turn, alternating which one of us gets to play that turn for Crazy Don; then that person barters with the others when there's a tie. It's kind of fun bartering with yourself.  But it's embarrassing when Crazy Don wins!

Basari is a light, little game with a rock/paper/scissors mechanic and a bit of negotiation thrown in. I don't foresee this getting much playing time although it works well for those mandatory family get-togethers.

Basari has proved to be one of my favourite games of all time. We play with an essential variant which is to roll one die at the beginning of every round and move everyone's meeples that distance. This way the die action has more clearly defined benefits. In order to get the most out of the game it must be played with exactly 4 players.

The game is easy to teach and has enough randomness that new players are not necessarily going to lose, although it is likely. So there is skill, but I would say this is on the analytically easy side of things in terms of games that I usually enjoy.

Two things set this game apart for me and have kept me coming back for more over the past years. Foremost is the action selection. There are 3 possible actions and each player simultaneously chooses among them. If two players choose the same action they must barter to see who gets the right to perform the action. If more than 2 players choose the same action no one gets to do it. The position of player's meeples on the track determines the benefits of each action, so each round you must assess where everyone is standing and which actions appeal most to them and try to figure out what everyone will choose. This deduction/prediction is where almost all the fun is in the game. 

The second element which I enjoy tremendously is the bartering. Players have gems in 4 colours, red, yellow, green, and blue. They have inherent value with red being the most valuable to blue being the least in the order stated in the previous sentence. An offer involving more gems is always better than one involving fewer gems, otherwise the greater number of red gems, then yellow gems, etc... determines which offer is better. Points are awarded for having the majority (plurality) of gems of a given colour at the end of each round, the winner looses 3 gems of that colour. The bartering affects the majorities so one has to be very shrewd when making or accepting an offer. 

The game is elegant and relatively short. The density of satisfying decisions is pretty high. The one problem is the production quality of the game, the graphics are bit dated and the board has an American valley. Nothing too serious, but it does detract a little bit from the experience.

The mechanism (bluffing or rock-paper-scissors) of tying to guess what other players are going to choose and then make your choice appropriately is one that works for me in Pirate's Cove, but was not enamoured with it in this game.  I am not entirely sure why.  That said I think it has a lot to do with penalties being applied when you make the same decision as another player, compare this to Goldbrau where lesser rewards are made.  Carrot vs stick in action, I prefer the carrot.

I must say the components are excellent.

RATING: 6.1
This would be an excellent game for introducing to new/non -gamers who have only played Sorry and Monopoly. It has the roll-and-move aspect they understand, but offers choices each round that get them used to greater complexity. The psychological thinking and second-guessing keeps the game fresh, and the bartering/counter-offering ensures that the game keeps players interacting with each other, although this last feels like it slows the game down when it happens many turns in a row.

Another game where you have 3 choices and  it's best when your choice isn't anyone else's.  Try to outwit your opponents.  Rating is based only on 4-plyr version of the game.  For me, that seems to me to be the ideal way to play it.  

Also, I recommend playing it with a rules variant (and IMO, a more balanced game):  only one die is rolled at the beginning of each turn so that ALL players move that equal number of spaces rolled.  Therefore, the only way to get ahead of anyone else is by picking the "Roll Die" card/role instead of being lucky.  In the original rule of each player rolls their own die (so if a player gets lucky & keeps rolling high, there is not much need to choose the "Roll Die" action).  My rating is based only WITH this variant rule.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice quick negotiation game. I think it plays slightly better with 3 than 4. The die rolls do make it a bit random, but having everyone use the same die roll is a bit over the top. I think an average die makes a better solution.

I so wanted to like this more.  I like the negotiation/offering when you tie and the balancing between the different choices available is interesting too.  But the 3 pick the same no one gets to do anything rule really irks me, especially in a 4 player game where 3 players sit on their hands and one advances.  Getting to do nothing is Not Fun.  Actually the blind bid of your chosen action is quite irritating as well, as it appears to be quite chaotic whether you get to do your action feely or have to pay to do it (even as you consider your move and what others might do, you can get in a Princess Bride type situation where you can't do that because he'll do that so I'll do that but then...etc).  As it stands, I will likely never play this one again.  So many other and better games to play.

RATING AFTER ONE PLAY, Four Player Session: From the looks of the Out of the Box Publishing version, I thought this looked like a slight, family-game-night filler game.  Oh, was I wrong.  This game is very, very strategic, tactical and cut-throat.  You have to consider the immediate, medium and longer term picture when making choices, which boils down to which of three action cards to play, or how many gems to barter to break ties when two action cards of the same type are played by opposing player.  Pure gamer fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
An older, boring little abstract game with old components.  You play in three rounds where you are moving around a board to get back to your old piece by rolling and moving.  On your turn you role and then place a card down that allows you to collect gems, get points or move again.  At then end of the round, the player with the most gems of the four colors gets points.  The game is pretty abstract and there is bit of "I know that you know that I know" going on in that card selection.  In general though, if you move around and get the bonus for getting to your piece first, I think there is a bit of advantage to rolling well.  

I did not really like the game.  Its components and board look dated with boring art work.  It would have been a 6 o 7 in its day, but in the modern board world this drags it down.

I found the 4 player game slightly clunky with dual bartering. It's a bit more complex than first appears. I think this is a great little gateway game to introduce barter and negotiations. It doesn't play long. I suspect that this works well as a 3 player game. With 4, there are probably better games to play. Glad I got it cheap.

After several plays, I have decided that I don't like this game.  The negotiation aspect (which is central to the game) always leaves me feeling as if I got hosed.  I'm not crazy about how the negotiations are structured.  It doesn't seem like there's enough room to truly negotiate.  Instead, it's offer, counteroffer, countercounter offer, ad nauseum.  The last time we played, I decided to pick my card totally at random, and that worked for me.  It is probably how I will always play this game from here on out.

Don't let the rules deceive you -- this is actually a pretty good trading game. I was afraid that the randomness (die roll) would have a huge impact on the game, but it doesn't seem to. I was also worried about the simultaneous action selection (I hate "I think that you think that I think" games), but in this case there is information avaiable to make educated guesses (kinda like in poker). I really like the trading mechanisms -- I'd call it "smart man trading" where you can force your opponent, with the proper bid, to accept something meaningless or force him to give you something really good.

A fun & light game with aspects of guessing/bluff, negotiation & set-collection.  The negotiation phase had more of an auction feel to me.  Looking forward to trying ES&R.  UPDATE: Moved rating down 1.25 points just because I prefer Witch's Brew & Edel, Stein & Reich better.

Players simultaneously choose to either 1) advance on the game board by rolling dice 2)get gems 3) get VPs. If one player is the only one choosing that action they get it. If two players have chosen the action, they must negotiate by giving gems. If three players have chosen the same action, none get it! Probably my favourite of the so called everyone secretly choose a marker then flip to see what happens. You can attempt to guess what other people will pick. Earn VPs by having majority in gems, advancing on the game board or earn straight VPs. It's simple, best with 4 players.

RATING: 9
I love this game!  There's not much in the box, but both the board and components are visually very pleasing (FX Schmid edition).  Tight, well balanced rules and short playing time make this my favourite 3-player game.  Most actions are simultaneous, so the game just hums along -- the best way to spend 45 minutes or less.

Don't listen to those who say this is best with four!  I find the 4p game to be slow (due to the double-barter rounds), inelegant ("which negotiation goes first, again?"), and unbalanced (since 3-way ties benefit only one player).  The 3p game has none of these problems, so while the game still [i]works[/i] with 4, I'll usually prefer to play something else (ymmv).

Also -- I've played this many times using the standard rules (each player rolls their own movement die), and never yet felt the need to use the single dieroll variant.  Sure, it does make movement less random (though also less exciting), but the game is [b]not[/b] dominated by this random element.  Skillful play will still determine the winner, so why change it?

A better, cleaner design than its successor [i](Edel, Stein und Reich).[/i]

On the surface, not the most exciting idea for a game--trading gems--but it's a solid family-style game that forces players to make choices and includes bartering to try to get best advantage toward one's final score. Won from publisher in a writing contest, November 2009. Sold, January 2014.

RATING: 8
Very good out-guessing game, where you're rewarded / punished when you don't guess correctly, with a neat trading subgame. I was surprised that none of the enjoyment of the 4 player version seemed to dissipate with 3 players. You'd think from the mechanics that it was made for 4 players only. Not true. It's a light 45-60 minute romp of think and doublethink - sometimes you want to be the lone hand, other times you really want to double up on someone to be able to re-organise and negotiate changes to your jewel collection.

RATING: 6
The game felt more like a race than a bartering experience. You try to get ahead better jewels than your opponents and then you choose the move action to end the game quick.

The bartering also seemed inefficient. There was  rarely a mutually beneficial trade to be made because you could never rely on the die roll to help you get back anything you trade away.

Perhaps I played with the wrong people. I had fun with the game, but never felt like I was in control of the outcome.

Some interesting choices here in negotiation, but the game is essentially based upon simultaneous action selection.  If one person chooses an action, they get it, if two people choose it, they barter, if three or more people choose it, nobody gets it.  In the end, this leaves you with very little control, unless you're a mindreader.

Since I had learned the card game, Dan thought it would be good to actually play the board game. It was a good idea! I liked this game a lot! I did enjoy it more than the card game. I felt it had good pacing and moved better than the card game. There were some interesting choices and more chances to score points. I very much enjoyed this game and look forward to another play someday.

RATING: 5
Mechanically similar to Adel Verpflichtet, but the mental processes in playing Basari is more left brain i.e. point evaluations. Deduction of what your opponents will do is alittle long winded, as is resolving shared needs by bartering of gems, whereas AV does it far smoother. Game play is more fiddly here, with the tedium of round scoring thrown in. Sure, Basari is more emotionally friendly, but is also less fun.

I'd played and enjoyed Edel, Stein and Reich once so was interested to try its predecessor Basari. The psychology/double-think of the simultaneous action selection is just the same, but Basari has a simpler die-roll option instead of special action cards. I quite appreciate the simplicity, though the actions cards were fun. We played the variant with a common die-roll each round instead of individual ones - seemed to work fine. The best part of both games is probably the bartering system - lots of opportunities to either off a low bid that's just what your opponent needs or a high one that's completely useless to them.

This game is so simple yet brilliant.  I love the bargaining mechanic, and how you can focus on different strategies.  The only downside of this game is the need to play it with 3-4 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another clever game of optimization, second guessing, and negotiation. The biggest drawback is the need for all players to be on the same level as one weak player can destroy the scoring by poor negotiation offers. Best with 4, only rates a 6 with 3. Game will not play well at all if one person picks the 'gem strategy' and isn't effectively contested by the other players (would rate a 4). Overall, I think it is all about gems though.

Good litte game good with 3 players but realy made for 4 players. The material is OK but that's all. The mechanic of the game is simple and the rules are clear and easy to teach. The game is fast past and realy interactive. You need to look at your opponents options in order to choose what your going to play. Do you want to block or play your game? You will have to hask youself this question trough out the game. It realy fun but might not be liked by people who do not like to bargin because there is a fare share of barginning in that game.

Bon petit jeu à joueurs mais meilleur à 4 joueurs. Le matériel est OK mais sans plus. La mécanique du jeu est simple et les règles sont claires et facile à expliquer. Vous devez regarder les options des autres joueurs dans le but de savoir ce que vous jouerez. Voulez vous bloquer les adversaires ou jouer votre jeu. Vous aurez à vous poser la question tout au long de la partie. C'est vraiment un jeu intéressant mais qui peu déplaire à certaines personnes à cause de la phase d'enchères qui joue un rôle prédominant dans la partie.

Great bartering game that plays quickly, is simple to explain and good fun.

This game is a lot more fun than it deserves to be.  Perhaps because pairing up in a choice lets you do the interesting trading, so it is not total hosage unlike Lowenherz where it is all bad.

RATING: 6
Basari is a quick, fun simultaneous action selection game in the vein of Adel Verpflichtet.  What sets Basari apart is the bartering stage of the game, which is an interesting mechanic that I enjoyed.  My small gripe in the game was the fact that when more than two people pick the same thing it merely gets canceled, rather than a big batter happening.  However for a game that plays in 40 minutes, and has fun decisions throughout, I can hardly hold a grudge.

I like the rock, paper, scissors aspect to it.  You can make an educated guess as to what other people are going to do, and choose your action accordingly.

Basari (FX Schmid edition) -- Played once; four-player.  

I don't care for the board in the Out of the Box edition of Basari.  I find the FX Schmid version quite nice.  

I'm curious to see how it compares with Edel, Stein & Reich, as Basari has the randomness of dice-controlled travel around the board (in turn determining round length), while Edel, Stein & Reich provides its randomness in the form of Event cards.

A very good negotiation game. I like the heavy structures for the negotiation, which can introduce a lot of tactics. This is a rock-scissors-papers game with enough weights to each decision that it won't be a total crap shoot. My only complaint is the high random factor related to the die rolls (but this complaint has lessened a bit through play).

OOB version.

Shades of Adel Verflichtet as players move their pawns and select one of three actions to execute. The catch? If 3 players select the same action, they cancel each other out. If 2 select similar actions, the negotiations begin!

The negotiations are based on gems that players own. Points are scored for finishing one lap as well as by selecting the VP action. At the end of each of the 3 laps, players get points for having majority in each of the gem types.

Good fun and moves fairly quickly thanks to the 'limited' scope of the negotiations.

This is a wonderful little system.  While the Raj action selection system isn't overwhelmingly innovative (and for most games rather irritating), it doesn't feel as random and really works in this context. People will be positioned so that you can usually gauge what you are up against.  The roll and move bit strangely works here as it gives a the race becomes a vehicle to allow for the game to feel active without distracting from the heart of the game, trading.  Really this is a wonderful filler.

It is like rocks, paper, scissors, although you also have to factor in people&#039;s motivations on each turn, which can depend on where they landed and how far around the board they are, in addition to their holdings and overall standing in the game.

[Out of the box 2003 edition] {Merchant, gateway; set collection, blind-action selection, negotiation, roll and move; optimal 4p} Basari is a decent family game. It provides decisions and has loads of fun. It is welcome by girls, too :) Recommended when you are hosting a game party mixed with newbie.

Basari is my favorite bartering game. It's amusing to barter with your friends. In addition, you will know their characters better (you will know who's friendly and who's harsh :D ).  However, once you learnt their personality, the bartering process may become trivial.

Although simultaneous action is involved, Basari is not highly chaotic. Players still have many decisions and controls to optimize their scores. It can be won by either avoiding crashing with others or actively crashing with others. It always happens that some players try to "steal" gems from other player by intentionally selecting the same action with him.

[Old edition] The gems of FX Schmidt are better than OOTB - they really look like gems rather than glass stones.

[Dice] Some people don't like the dice-rolling but I think it's acceptable in this game (I don't like heavy dice-rolling either): 1) this game is for family, no need to take it as a serious strategy game 2) it is not the dominant factor because there are multiple path of scoring, 3) it adds another kind of excitement and makes the game more dynamic and 4) it provides another way for lagging players to catch up.

Played 3+ times. Good game very tactical.  I struggle with this educated blind bidding mechanism. UPDATE: I discovered a couple things in the last game; 1) the “blocking” roll selection to force a 3 way tie and no action and 2) everyone in my group is overpaying during bartering so accepting the offer is generally a better deal than winning the action.  (this should drive the bartering for actions down a bit).  2006/01/25

An outstanding game that I enjoy greatly, This has moved from a 10 to a 9 in my ratings in recent years owing to the quality of new releases in the decade-plus since I first rated Basari, but it has stood the test of time and remains a favorite, It only rates this highly if the alternate rule of rolling one die and moving all player tokens the same number of spaces is used.

watch for it - auction and negotiation

RATING: 6
The mechanics of the game are fine -- I don't mind the race around the track and I like trying to guess my opponents' choices -- but the theme is just so dull and so random that it ultimately feels pointless.

UPDATE: I'd like to try this one again.  The implementation of theme isn't make-or-break like it used to be for me.

RATING: 8.5
I'm still trying to puzzle out whether I enjoy this less or equal to Edel, Stein & Reich. The race track option both adds and detracts with its simplicity. But part of me hates to choose that option simply because its boring, so I suppose the edge goes to Edel.

Apparently I'm not particularly good at out-guessing my opponents, as evidenced by the fact that I got utterly destroyed in my one playing of this game.  It was an interesting concept, but dragged a bit.  It doesn't seem like enough game to fill the time it takes.

RATING: 6.5
This is a great game for three players.  I normally hate blind role selection, but the bidding component really makes the game.  The only complaint I have heard is from someone who could not wrap their mind around the bidding, but I don't think it would be that hard for most people.

This is "gem." Very little to no downtime and wonderful player interaction. I really like the bidding in the game and trying to outfox others players as they try and determine their next move. This game is why I play games.

This is a good, quick game.  Very easy to teach.  I like how with 4 people there is the guaranteed overlap of action choices.  It is almost a glorified Rock-Paper-Scissors, in a good way.

Played twice & won both times.  First time went for top scoring jewels and got the win.  2nd time got the jewels in first 2 round and then the 3rd round went for the fastest lap.  I like the card playing & then the negoiatition if necessary.

I first watched others playing (the first time I met Brian he was playing with Tony and Al at his house) this game and I couldn't figure out what they were doing.  Actually, it's a very simple rules game, lots of fun, very quick/short. I've played lots of this, and will play it any time.

Played three times with four players (original version by FX Schmidt). This game is great fun for gamers and non-gamers alike. It is easy to explain and plays quickly, with hardly any downtime. It is also VERY interactive. In my experience, players love it even more on subsequent plays.

Gret fun. I like roll and move games if they ad something more than just rolling and moving. When you are in the mood for something light, quick and fun, basari is pretty much as good as it gets.

Played this for the first time at the PGA - nice, simple game with nice, complex interactions and lovely plastic gems. Might pick up the English language version when it comes out.

RATING: 5.8
When you do a rock-paper-scissors mechanic, you need to have various things which affect the players' potential motivation for choosing specific things.  This game does, is one of the few that does, and thus works very acceptably at doing that.

RATING: 6
The simultaneous reveal mechanism is interesting, but it makes it so that the game reaches its potential with EXACTLY four players; otherwise, it's possible that everyone takes an individual action.  The game is finely balanced in the way that you reduce the number of gems you have once you claim majority.  My only complaint is that the dice can dictate a significant number of points in a given game.

Haven't quite got the hang of this one, not sure whether that a fault of me or the game.  Starkly divides my friends too.  Entertaining and light, with a good feel, but I'm put off by the pseudo-arbitrary numbers/gems - wish the dsign could have been mosre transparent.

The blind bid with negotiation element is pretty amazing. I could play this game over and over, day after day. It has a clean and well distilled set of mechanics. Another sweet, short, four player game.

It's REALLY GOOD but I'll probably like it more once I get the hang of it... I'd like to play under other circumstances to get the real feel for the game. I like the element of negotiation, although I'm no good at it, and collection. I like that laps get bonus points and that it's a quick/easy to understand game. There's not much I don't like about it, it just doesn't feel quite right yet, that's all.

To be played only with four.

It drives me crazy when people play their action cards completely at random.  What's worse is when they come close to winning.

I like the forced trading, which is an unusual mechanic.

Similar to Edel, Stein & Reich but with a few significant changes. It's easier to read the game state in Basari since all the information is presented on a central board. It also seemed easier to collect lots of gems in this game, without the tight limit imposed by the supply in ESR and with fewer gems being discarded by a winning player, but this makes it very hard to catch up a player with a huge gem lead. I prefer the limits of ESR. I also missed the special power cards, which are replaced here by an extra movement/points action. The light bluffing and deduction common to both games is very enjoyable.

I was skeptical after looking at the rules, but this is a very good game.  It takes 3-5 minutes to learn how to play, and a new player can challenge a vetren after only 1 play.

English version of Edel, Stein, & Reich with a few significant changes.  The replacement of card drawing with a movement mechanic really works and might actually make the game better.  The decisions made when bartering are truly agonizing, which is definitely the sign of a good game IMO.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Nice, light game of guesswork, a bit of bluffing, and trying to figure out what your opponents want. I like the bartering system of escalating bids to bribe another player for the right to use an action. The board, however, is clumsy -- I can now see the attraction to the card decks used in Ein, Stein & Reich, the revisioning of Basari.

Trading is the main element of this game with a bit of luck in the die rolls to keep it interesting. A player who isn't mindful of how a current trade will affect the gem majorities can ruin the game for all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Clever mechanics but the board mechanism is clunky.  I much prefer the feel of Edel, Stein and Reich (if only they'd release that in English).  

I also have the newer version with the horribly redone graphics.  The spaces are too small, the gem markings too hard to read, and it's way too bland.

Additional note:  I was recently taught the variant where all players perform their standard move to a single die roll applying to everyone.  This gives the game an easy 7.5 rating for me (up from my original 6.5 rating) as it truly makes the game work *much* better.

I think this is a really neat bartering game.  It can get a bit mathy when you're deciding what barter offers are worth making/accepting, but I actually found the jockeying for position in the various colors pretty fascinating... Gwen and her sister did not... and there was no interest among the game group in trying it... so I traded it away.

A great game of psychology.  Outguess your opponent and reap the rewards.  Fail to do so and suffer stagnation.  Don't know why this doesn't get played more than it does.

An interesting, fast-moving game that should work well with non-gamers and those that like some interaction without nastiness. PLayers that enjoy Settlers of Catan, for instance, because of the interaction, are likely to enjoy this.

Toma el rol de un mercader que compite en las calles por las lucrativas gemas del mercado. Cada turno los jugadores mueven simultáneamente a sus mercaderes por el tablero, y luego intercambian gemas para obtener valiosos puntos. El jugador con la mayor cantidad de puntos al final de la tercera ronda gana el juego.

RATING: 6.5
Simple bartering, some luck. There are 30 steps around the board, so it is possible to go around the board with 5 * d6 rolls. And even with a game this simple a couple of rules missed on the 1st try...

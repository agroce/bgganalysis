You can see there is some strategy of picking trumps or choosing the order to play your cards, but with small hands, it seems like it is way outwashed by the randomness of the deal.

There is no reason to play this instead of Hearts which it vaguely hints at.

Somewhat novel trick taking card game.  Our party game group has enjoyed a couple of games of this, but upon completion we've NEVER looked at each other and exclaimed, "Let's play this one again right now!"  Likely to make an occasional appearance, but not anybody's perennial favorite.  [Thrift $1.50]

An interesting style of trick-taking game where every suit can be trump.  (It's all about priority of suits.)  I really like the way the rank of suits is always changing, and the catch-up mechanic of jumping over pieces is really nice.  Because of the short playtime and the fun strategies, this is one of my new favorite trick-taking games.

OK trick taking game. Some interesting tactics can be used like deliberately losing tricks to block a trumpet space, set up a hopping move, etc. but overall the game just isn't as good as the trick-taking classics (Pinochle, Bridge, Spades, etc.).

RATING: 4
This game is a trick-taking game in which the hierarchy of trumps changes.  This is far too chaotic for my taste.  First of all, there are six suits, but each player is only dealt seven cards.  This makes it very easy for players to be void in one or more suits, in which case the game degenerates to a battle of "who has the most trumpets and high trumps"--and that's pure luck.  There's a little strategy with moving on the game board and with playing cards between the frequent flips of trump order, but the rest is very random.

Mostly uninteresting trick playing game except for the uncongurous leap-frog scoring track. Probably more fun with fewer players when there's more chance to pick which tricks to win for maximum leap/trump setting. I've only played with 6 players which was quite random.

RATING: 5
There are definitely better trick taking card games out there.  What makes this one different is the way trumps are determined.  The suits/trumps (more than 4) are ranked with more powerful trump being highest on the board.  There are several points in the game where the players can readjust the ranking of trumps.  This happens often and really throws a big random element in.  So your hand can go from the penthouse to the outhouse very quickly.  Maybe this is better w/fewer players. We usually end up playing w/max #.

[Original comment] With two house rule changes {see: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/7441}, this is one of the best card/board games I have played. In our group, a 6-year-old and an 8-year-old have won several seven-player games, and the adults enjoy it even more than the kids.

(December 2006) We have played this with as many as 9 players, and it works well, no matter the number. Still one of our favorite games.

May 2009 -- This continues to be one of my favorite games, although we don't play it as often these days as we used to. There are just too many good games in our collection, and this one simply doesn't get selected very often.

Dec 2010 - This is still a favorite game for the family, although we don't play it as often, because we have so many other fun games and limited time to play.

October 2011 -- We have played this game for many years, and I think we will enjoy playing it for many more. That is a high compliment for any game. We have begun playing it fairly often again.

November 2012 -- After all these years, this is still a family favorite.

2013-November:  I suspect we will play this game forever, as we still enjoy it very much.

This is a great little trick taking game to play between heavier games.  It's light, quick, and requires at least a Little strategy.  One important note: Do NOT trust the box when it comes to how many players can play this.  2 player trumpet is horrible.

RATING: 7.5
A great lite trick taking game with 6 suits and a board game element instead of the usual deck of cards.  Changing my rating a bit after some more thought.  This game is awesome with 6 people and progressively less fun with less - but still fun.  With less people there is more of a chance of a runaway player or getting stuck too far behind on the board.  With 6, everyone is in the game and the radical jumps on the game board are a blast. I haven't ever had a group of people that I've introduced the game not like it.

Too many suits and too few cards in hand makes for a game with few decisions of any consequence.  A bit of bad luck early in the game can put a player well behind the conga line, with no hope of ever catching up with the rest of the pack.

This game is a lot of fun if you like trick taking games (euchre, hearts, spades etc.). The trump is always changing and creating a hierarchy of power. Very interesting on how the lead can change suddenly when your losers are suddenly winners. It's surprising how often only 3 trumpet cards can come out in play.

Thrifted again on 16/12 2013. Four sets of cards = uhh, some game that requires 6x11x4? I'm sure there's something.

Thrifted again on 16/8 2014. Five sets of cards = Spender Slam.

This is a clever adaptation on trick taking which handicaps the person in first.  The trump tokens make this well worth playing and the end game is great.  The only reason this does not rate higher is because one play at a time is generally enough and it has a higher luck factor than most trick based games.  Also, some of the shield rules annoy me.

Here's a race - all players come forward jumping to the next free space by winning tricks with cards from 1 to 11 on six suits: a player starts on one set and the others have to follow suit. If they can't, they can either throw something useless or trump... trump? Yes, there is a trump scale: if a player moves forward on the race track and lands on a space with a shield on it, they can choose a suit to be placed on its upper echelon, and if it's full they can swap any two suits. If the trumps are still not enough, there are still trumpets (three special cards that beat all the trumps).

While most trick-taking games distinguish themselves by convoluted scoring systems, bidding or other elaborate mechanisms, Trumpet surprises completely by merging several rather simple concepts into a still light game with an incredibly smooth flow. Its crystal-clear concept means that it can be taught and assimilated extremely quickly, and both its spirited play and its tactical choices guarantee great replayability. Even though there might be some runaway situation, most ends are tight: if two players are on the end of the track and one of them wins a trick, they can push the other backwards to the next free space.

RATING: 5
A trick-taking game that's some ok fun but becomes more and more of a lottery as the game goes on. Standard trick-taking, but with 6 suits numbered 1-11, plus three uber-trump cards. A la Canyon, it's actually a race game, but here you advance a space with every trick won (as opposed to 'called' tricks), leaping opponents Ursuppe style. You start the game as no trumps, but as people advance and land on a "Trumps" square, you get to set any suit you like as trumps. Things are still pretty normal for a while, but by mid-game all the suits become trumps, and they're ranked. So if you're short suited on the lead, all your other cards are trumps and the choice is to try and get away with winning using a low trump suit card or try to lock it in with a high trump suit card. With only 7 cards in hand, and 6 suits, with a bunch of cards missing from each hand, you have no idea whether you're high or not with your lead, and with shortsuiting happening all over the place ... well, each trick is its own little lottery. As a result, the game provides some time-passing fun, with moans and groans as each trick gets trumped (or inexplicably everyone has to follow suit) but there's nothing here that says there's more to explore and makes me want to play again. At least it plays quickly and can provide some family fun.

They should have name this game "Random! Extreme Edition". This game has so much randomness to it that you will be wasting your time trying to come up with any winning strategy or tactics. Winning or losing this game has little to do with your play. It doesn't even have an element of fun. A total waste of time.

This game is... actually quite fun, I was surprised.

I was going to write revised thoughts on this game, but I realized I don't remember a damn thing about it. It's been so long since we played. I seemed to think it was pretty good, a six is a pretty damn high score from me. This game is moldering away in our attic now, so a repeat play is pretty unlikely.

A great introduction to the world of trick-taking. It has enough unpredictability to satisfy non-gamers, too. A clever mixture of a crad game & board game. I believe in really earns its award from Games Magazine as the Game of the Year

We have an extra set. Using two decks saves time between hands.

A fairly interesting trick taker.  Because of the scoring system, if you start off with a couple of bad hands and drop behind the pack, it can be very difficult to catch back up.  We always play two or three games at a time to even this effect out a bit.

A couple of fun ideas in here that got us to play it a few times, but eventually there's a lack of depth and we know better card games.

[International Games 1990 Edition] A good vintage trick-taking game.  Compared to modern games, this looks old.  I don't think I will play this copy.  But, as a fan of trick-taking games, I am glad that I found a good copy :)

A game I enjoy but can't tell you why. I guess this did get me more into different games. A trick taking card game where trump is changed at any point of time.

Fairly fun card and board game.  Good couples game.  Not deep, but easy-to-learn, fast-playing, and fun.

RATING: 6.3
Possibly very random but quite surprisingly enjoyable. A game of varying trumps and a peloton style score track which keeps most people involved until the end. I'm unsure of the reason why you'd want negative scoring at the end (the ability to drag people back instead of score yourself) and I think the peloton scoring could lead to some very odd game ends (where a player in 6th wins in one hand if everyone is grouped together at the end) but this had a surprising amount of charm.

Trumpet is one of the very best trick-taking games.  It has straightforward game play with an easy-to-read board and cards.  The only downside is the very frequent shuffling.

This is a great little trick taking game. Lots of fun when it's just a social night.

Good game to break in non-gamers who play cards.  Have given it as gift a number of times and it's gone over well.

Don't play this one as often as we used to but for 500/bridge players it's a great game. The changing values of the suits is a very intersting mechanism.

Not much into trick-taking games, but this wasn't bad for a thrift-store find.  Definitely needs some house rules and play with more players.

RATING: 9
Easy to learn, fast playing trick taking card game where taking tricks moves your pawn around a board towards the win at the end. Along the way you can land on spaces that let you choose the ranking of the suits.

Everyone we've introduced to this wanted to buy a copy. Too bad it's out of print.

meh. Not a fun game at all. Perhaps if the game was half as short, it would be a good distraction and filler. As it stands, game is far too long and players lagging behind have a tough time catching up. Yuck.

One play, with 6.  A neat idea to have constantly-changing trump order, but I found it made the game more chaotic than I like, with little incentive to plan ahead.

Fun trick-taking game that could use minor rule tweaks, but is, otherwise, surprisingly solid.  Not a lot of control compared to something like Sticheln, for instance, but still enjoyable.

Gwen likes trick taking games and this seems to have a neat twist for that kind of game.  I math traded for a copy... we'll see when I can get it played.

Good trick-taking game that I was not initially impressed with but has grown on me. It's a great fit for traditional family game night.

1st play: Dr Finn does it again with a nice, fast game that plays in about 30-45 minutes, making a great lunchtime game. It's not going to win any SdJ awards, but for the niche it's playing in, it's good.

2nd play: this is a solid filler game with good reveals. A competitor to Biblios for sure, but probably not quite as good.

Only about five plays into Gunrunners at this point, but very happy with the Kickstarter experience for this game. A few normally non-gamer friends have been clamoring to play it again after playing it on the weekend it showed up. This has been another typical Finn game with simple mechanics that have deep impacts on and twists to the game.

A pretty tactical card game with a decent theme.  Not as chaotic as it would seem.  I liked it and want to play again to see if it is only okay or if it's good.  Card play in this one, for me, was fun.  We had not played before but I can see after playing a couple of times you want to keep cards for certain moments. I did like how you play a card but it doesn't get incorporated into play right away.  That allowed for some interesting card play (for me).

This game has some interesting ideas in it, unfortunately it's a bit too clunky for the simple card game it should be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's fun and fast, but I feel like you have too little control over what happens.There are cards which will let people move what others have placed. It doesn't seem like you can play around those cards because you may not flip their card, but someone else could. Also, there isn't much of a way to even guess what is laid down to either bluff what you placed or try and counter what you may think someone is doing.
That being said, I'll still play this game and have fun. The simple rules and fast play time make this game easy to get out.
If you're looking for some good filler I'd recomment Biblios, Scripts & Scribes The Dice Game and Capo dei Capi all by Steve Finn over Gunrunners, but Gunrunners is still a fine choice.

2014-06-08 - This is a good little area control game. I'm pretty bad at it, but I have fun playing it. The card play is interesting, deciding between playing an agent undercover, or playing it as a probationary agent whose value will eventually be revealed (and possibly allow for a special action). Not surprising from Dr Finn, definitely worth checking out.

2017-11-06 - Everything I said above is true, but I just don't think I'm likely to pull this off the shelf in favor of other options.

RATING: 6.75
Cube-collecting game with two key twists: first, you roll the die to find out which location gets a cube; second, you place your card face down, forcing another player to risk adding it to the totals when triggering cube distribution -- because the highest gets half, then the next highest get half, and so on. Plus six of your fourteen point cards give you an added ability when revealed. The results end up fairly balanced though it doesn't seem so. A decent starter or finale game.

PLUS: balance, speed of play, minor strategy element
MINUS: theme seems pasted over not a key part of the game

I'm glad to see Dr. Finn back in his Scripts & Scribes form. After S&S hit I bought every game that Dr. Finn released, and I have to say I was rather unimpressed and figured that he may have been a one hit wonder, which is fine because that one hit is one fantastic game in a small package. Gunrunners intrigued me though, the artwork was spot on, and gameplay reminded me a lot of what I liked about S&S, simple abstract gameplay leading to deep decision points. And I am happy to say that that is exactly what Gunrunners offers to those who play it. The ruleset is simple and you can get new players up and running in about about 5 minutes. The choices on your turn are easy and straightforward which cuts down on anyone who is prone to AP, and the games definitely rewards clever decision making throughout. In the end what you get is a really quick playing (about 20 min) multiplayer game that has you guessing and bluffing for most of that time, and a game that has a lot of interesting choices to make until the very end. 

To be honest I think this may be better than Scripts & Scribes.

Nice light filler, with just enough going on to be fun without being any sort of serious challenge.  Works very well with 8 and 10 year old kids, whilst also keeping parents entertained. 

Seems to work better with 3 than 4, playing faster and more engagingly.  Great value bundled with the Capo kickstarter, very pleased to have on the shelf

Another neat filler from Dr. Finn's games. 

The 'delay' in getting the cards out the way you want them is a nice mechanism.

it's a cool little filler. I enjoy the Theme, and the artwork is very nice. It's not my fav Finn game nor my go to filler, but it's a keeper for us. We've enjoyed it everytime, again, the theme is nice.

Okay little card game where unfortunately the fiddly nature of the dice rolling and cube placement gets in the way of the enjoyment for me. Rather uninspiring random game. Little in the way of planning or clever calculating play takes place. If you're up for a fast little filler then it's okay.

Disclaimer: I did not back this on Kickstarter, I won a copy direct from the designer.

Gunrunners plays very quickly; probably a little over 20 minutes with four players. There are a lot of options you have on your turn and there are a lot of interesting tactical things you can do. To do well, you'll need somebody else to co-operate with you, unless you can jump in at the last minute and steal points from others, so you're forced into brief, shifting alliances almost. Alternatively, you can play cards (as probationary agents) into places where you know others will flip them, giving you the immediate use of the card abilities. This is another winner from the designer of Biblios.

Funnish and simple micro game that is easy to teach to others.  I like the surprise factor from not completely remembering what card was placed where when agents are activated or during busts.  I'm just not a big fan of the gun running theme in developing country hot spots.  Quick and small footprint make it good for the RV and camping.

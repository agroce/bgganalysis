In my youth, when there was less money and there were a billion fewer games to buy with it, I fooled around with some traditional games.  One of my briefest dalliances was with Mancala.  It drove me nuts because all information was open, there was no randomness in play and the range of options was small enough that it seemed possible to plot the entire course of the game from the opening position.  I lacked the brain power to do that, but knowing that it could be done irritated me greatly.  The same is true of Longhorn.

Production quality and artwork are decent.  The rules are well written.

solid two-player game with a twist on the mancala mechanic. kind of a mr-jack pocket meets 5 tribes that plays much faster than either of those two. has many routes to victory and you have to pay attention. i was initially disappointed with this game, but have come to enjoy it very much.

Probably need more plays to get a better idea. So far it seemed to be a fast filler game.

Managed to squeeze in time for another round. Was wondering why it did not hit the table as often. It is really a quick game. Re-read the rules and just played it. Pretty quickly got my wife cornered and she was captured by the sheriff in the act. This is only for 2 players and we found that it was just over before you know it.

Pretty fun little game!  Setup time would benefit from a couple baggies, but otherwise, quick to learn and to play.  It uses the mancala mechanic (take a certain number of tokens and move that number of spaces), and has enough randomness to allow for replayability.

Rapido y divertido juego para 2 jugadores. Muy visual con sus vaquitas, muy rejugable porque siempre cambia el setup (losetas, vacas por loseta y las habilidades por loseta).
Aparte de eso tiene el punto de estrategia basico necesario en un juego para 2, tienes que vigilar que vacas coges y adonde te mueves para intentar forzar el movimiento de tu rival que tu necesitas.

I really wanted to like this more. I actually love the decisions it presents, but I hate the Sheriff tile: having an instant win condition means that the latter part of the game can be totally deterministic (and can often be called several turns in advance). 

In abstract games like Chess I can tolerate this because the whole point of the game is to work your opponent into a corner, forcing them to lose. But in this game, there is an entirely different set of win conditions: gathering cattle and scoring based on the colors left on the board. To instantly lose after all of your effort has gone into collecting cattle is incredibly unsatisfying. I think we may just always remove the Sheriff tile from now on.

I really wanted to try this one because of the Western theme and its distinction of being 'Five Tribes Little Brother'. Also, it looked like fun! This game is very simple. Perhaps TOO simple. I kept looking for the game here. It kind of feels like Quarto where you place things randomly and the REAL game starts in the middle of the game where you try to avoid traps. Here you remove things randomly and from the middle of the game you try to avoid traps. Perhaps will suit those who like to have AP and scrutinize and dissect every move..."Hmmm..if I move here he can take this or that and move me to here there or there" Blech. Not my play style. I like to play off the cuff (some may say willy nilly) and get into the game and see what shakes out in the end.

The spelling errors and the dollar signs after the numbers also grated on my nerves. Seriously...would it kill you non-native English speakers to pay a proof reader??? :yuk: 
The rhino/cows were adorable :)

You know? Longhorn is actually a rather smart 2-player game! It doesn't appear to be getting much love on the 'Geek. It's got some ideas from Five Tribes (same designer) but a very nice scoring idea which can really make your brain twist. There's a lot of re-playability with the types of tokens that can come out and the configuration of the board. Funny theme, too! It's not a "wow" game but it certainly holds its own and probably deserves a bit more respect than it has been getting.

Overall the artwork was nice, although not for me, it was the best part of the game. I just felt the game was too fast, too simple, and felt very samey. I can see why my critiques are the exact reason a lot of gamer like this game and rate it higher, but based on my desire to ever play this again, it is a 3. I rate it a 5 because I respect that it is a good game for a lot of people, just not me.

This is a solid two-player game in that "If I do that, he does this, and I can do that" mindset. I like the scoring system a lot. I hate that Sheriff tile with a passion though, and it can drag on with players who take that analysis to an extreme. With players who understand that downtime is no fun, it's a solid game.

This is like a chess game. There is so much you can think and anticipate that it can brain freeze anyone who tries to see everything. Therefore, either this is neverending strategy, either it is very tactical and you play by gutfeeling.I prefer the latter. Every turn, you anticipate a little.

I love the art.
I wish there were more games without the Sheriff. With him, the whole game is about using or avoiding him. Also, he makes the game an extended coin flip.

Not sure there is much strategy to this game.
Lots of AP if you try to play strategically.
Might be more fun if I keep playing.

I found this game to be pretty "meh." Which is kind of a death sentence, in my book.  I found the game to lack very many meaningful choices, and the amount of randomness means that until the last third of the game, it's almost impossible to plan ahead, or try and guess what your opponent my do, let alone figure out what they should do, aka, their best move.

To be fair, I've only played two games.  I think that to really appreciate this game, you'd have to really love the pasted-on theme, and be willing to play it pretty regularly. Which....I'm not.

Ooooh this is right up my alley. Just a few rules, short play time, "can't eat just one," pretty components, variable setup, and tough decisions throughout. I absolutely love the way the value of each herd fluctuates, and how those fluctuations -- and other elements of the game state -- influence play.

Scripting ways to fuck over your opponent, and then seeing if they pan out, is a lot of fun. Solid game in a tight package.

This one caught me off guard. I guess I didn't realize just how abstract it feels. It's sort of like Five Tribes ultra light. We played 4 games in less than an hour, and one game took only 4 minutes. That's pretty awesome by itself. In addition, the components are great! The game comes with thick cardboard tiles and cow meeples. It's got a small footprint, which is nice. The art on the board tiles is pleasant. Despite the positives, this one left me a bit cold. Granted, I'm not a huge fan of abstracts. But I do like certain ones like Hive. The game is just a little difficult to wrap your head around, even after 4 plays. Not sure if I'll keep it, but glad I got the chance to play. It's certainly different.

This is a fun 2 player game that has a similar scoring mechanic to Rapa Nui, a favorite of ours, where what scores you points is at odds with how you score them. In Rapa Nui, the more resources you give up, the more they're potentially worth, but you have less by making them worth more.  In this game you get more points if there are more cows left on the board, but you want more of them so you get more money.

Very neat 2 player game by Bruno Cathala (signed copy from Essen 2014). 
Has a lot of mechanics that remind me of Five Tribes and talking to Bruno Cathala in Essen he told me he did indeed design them with the same idea in mind.
As I love Five Tribes a lot this game is also very well liked and it is interesting that depending on the setup - Sheriff or not - the gameplay and strategies feel very different. It's almost 2 different games with the same components, which to me increases replayability quiet a bit.

A much lighter 2 player only little brother to 5 tribes by the same designer. 10- 15 min gameplay and a very good gateway to teach people about the mancala mechanism.

RATING: 7
A unique, small, two-player game. Nothing else I own plays quite like it. The value of the cows being how many of that color are left on the board is my favorite mechanic. Just be aware that adding the sheriff tile changes the goal of the game almost entirely.

RATING: 7
+ Very easy to explain
+ Plays very quick
+ Despite the easy rules, it's not the obvious to play well

- Played 4 times and the player who fells behind, never seems to have a chance of getting back into the game
- Don't know if I love the sheriff: if you're opponent can move back each time, then you're screwed. My advice: stay away from the tile with the sheriff-token on!

This game is strictly 2 player. It has a feel of Five Tribes but is much different. It is very abstract and there is only so many options with the limited board and cows. Ultimately you are trying to collect a bunch of cows for points and to not be caught by the sheriff if he is in play. For me there was just not enough offered in the game to warrant more plays. There are other 2p games I would rather play. It wasn't bad but just not for me.

Quick but satisfying. Inventive, highly portable filler. Theme is largely irrelevant to the gameplay but the artwork and components are top-notch. There's definitely some thinking involved, especially toward the end of the game; it seems like you're mainly looking one or two moves ahead, but maybe there's deeper strategy I just haven't grasped yet.

a solid core game, but the state space is just too small for a 2 player deterministic game.  If it were 3 players, I think it would really shine.

Very clever, fast game. The points for the cows you collect is based on how many of each are left on the board at the end of the game, so it's a fun puzzle to set things up so that not every cow can be captured in the one you have the most in. I also like how you could also win by getting every cow, so even if you go too far so your cows would normally be worth nothing you can still end up securing victory anyway. The instant lose if you have to pick it up sheriff badge I was worried about at first, but once I played it just made the puzzle even more tricky.

I loved it in the beginning and then it started feeling samey and honestly, too quick and simple to remain engaging and even worse, fun. It has some good things going for it, like great artwork, it plays fast and there's no luck. But it's just too simple for me.

RATING: 6.5
An abstract 2-player game of positioning, with a loose western theme. The rules are very simple. It has the flavor of Kamisado -- your move sets up the opponent's -- but this is much faster. The random setup, with tiles/cows/actions all configured differently, is a nice touch! Good game, even for an abstract.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
There's a random setup, with the 3x3 grid having randomly assigned actions per tile, and a random distribution of the 36 cows (9 x 4 colors). Randomly chosen 2nd player places Outlaw token on a space.

On your turn:
1. Take all the cattle of one color from the Outlaw's current space. Then, if no cattle remain, take the action on the tile. If it's the Sheriff action, you lose! Otherwise, if you get 9 cows of the same color, you win!
2. Move the Outlaw token orthogonally as many spaces as the number of cattle you just claimed, to a space with 1+ cows; if you cannot, the game ends and players score. Each of collected cow is worth $100 per same-colored cow still on the board. Gold tokens are worth face value. The player with highest total wins!

It's from Cathala so you know the mechanics are solid, but it's just not engaging enough. Even with the random setup this game doesn't renew itself.

RATING: 7
Another small-box, two-player game that's got some decent strategy. This plays so fast that it's a good filler, and is easy enough to teach as an intro game. However, even with randomized tile placement, I think the best moves become obvious after very little play, so it's not a frequent flyer.

Bruno Cathala often creates short, clever games using spatial movement. Here, I think, is one of his very best. Longhorn is charming, can be explained in about 3 minutes, plays in about 10 minutes and has tons and tons of replayability due to the random set up (and the extra tokens).

Just wonderful. An early candidate for my favourite game of Essen '13.

This is another one of those that's not really that bad of a game, but it's not my kind of game. The pluses: it's an inventive two-player game, plays very quickly, nice components.
The minuses: everything is open information and there are only so many turns, so you could theoretically figure out a winner right after the initial set up. It's not quite as simple as that but you do have to think ahead several turns, and sometimes you just don't have any good options. And the last few turns literally play themselves. You will often only have one possible move on those turns so you just do the move without having to think about anything.

This does have a similar feel to Five Tribes, which is a game that I love. The big difference is that Five Tribes has so many variables you always have several different choices on a turn.

Why play this when 5 Tribes is available

RATING: 7
Simple rules, plays in 15 minutes and has some real depth. 

This and Jaipur both fill this niche nicely.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 4

RATING: 7
Including the setup, Longhorn takes only about 10 minutes to play. Because there is no luck element to this game (aside from the initial setup), after your opponent makes a good play, you often feel like you should have been able to foresee it. This can lead to occasional analysis paralysis, and can also mean the outcome of the game is determined before the last few turns. However, it's sometimes possible to steal an unexpected victory if your opponent has planned too heavily around a single win condition.

The variously colored cow meeples are excellent but seem easy to misplace, so it's surprising there are no extras included in the box. There are also no extra location tiles; the same 9 will be used for every game. I think I would have preferred a 4x4 board setup rather than a 3x3 because the small number of locations often means there are only a couple of possible moves to make on a given turn, which makes the game feel somewhat predetermined.

Overall, the theme is light but well-executed, the components are good quality, and the gameplay offers more replayability than most other purely strategic two-player games.

Longhorn is pretty much Cathala's remake of Five Tribes for the masses. This is a light game for two that utilizes the core mechanic of reverse worker placement. In this case, outlaws steal cattle and move around a grid array to trigger the end game and score points based on the size of the herd. There is one key difference between Longhorn and Five Tribes. Here, a pawn is moved around the array based on the number of cattle pieces picked up from the original tile. Unlike Five Tribes, the cattle is not deposited in each location mancala style. Instead, players can only perform valid moves on the pawn if the number of cattle taken matches the number of movement squares to another piece with some cattle.

It's a cute and solid game for two. 15 minutes per game tops and it has some moderate amounts of depth. Granted, you can quickly suss out the optimal move which does not pin you down. Even then, you are always get surprised by a move you hadn't consider.

A Társasjátékok Ünnepén kipróbált címben két játékos marhatolvajként tengeti mindennapjait. A változó elhelyezkedésű lapkákra különféle színű tehénfigurák kerülnek, ezekből lehet színenként elhajtani a zsákmányt. Ha egy területről mi zsákmányoljuk az utolsó állatokat, annak különleges képességét is használhatjuk. 
Egymás lépéseinek előre tervezésével, illetve a döntéseinek "beszorításával" dolgozik a játék, nem is olyan rosszul, de azért jobb két fős megoldásokat is láttunk már.

Very good, simple, quick, two-player, Kalaha/Macala-like game. A sort of cut-the-crap version of Five Tribes - with a bite - not just scoring points but forcing your opponent for get himself shot by the sherif or driving his herd into a snakepit.

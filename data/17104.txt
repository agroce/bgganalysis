GAME: Canasta
RANK: 2682
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The pack grows bigger and bigger...Canasta is an excellent partnership game for 4 but suffers as a 2 player game (where the first significant pack in a deal is almost always decisive). It improves a little as a 3 player game (but only when the players are evenly matched).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Probably my favourite traditional card game. A lot of luck, sure, but also a lot of deceiving and judging your opponents. I usually play this just with my wife, but when there's more people available, the game becomes even more fun and interesting!

I've played countless card games. This is my absolute favorite. More than any other game played with a deck of cards, I believe this game has the lowest luck factor. It's a fun game with 4 players, but I like it best as a 2 player game. I haven't played since I was in high school, but it's one of the most personally influential games I have played.

FAMILY

Players can play this with any two standard decks of cards (with jokers). I list this as "owned" because it is a game I like to play. It has been a family favorite for years. We play with the Classic Canasta rules found at pagat.com:
http://www.pagat.com/rummy/canasta.html

Recommended with 2-4 or 6 players (best 4). 45 mins.

Pretty good card game, and one I played over and over again when friends came over. Something satisfying about the big ass deck...

We also played a version of Canasta on the dart board, which was our favorite game.

Recently started playing this and it's great! I have distant memories of playing Canasta with my neighbors way back when (yes, I am a geezer geek!) but did not remember any more that.

My wife and I like rummy games a lot, so this is a natural for us. It has enough tactical choices and tough decisions to keep us involved in every hand. We'll be playing this a lot!

We play Canasta Classic, which seems less fiddly than the other options, and that works fine for us.

A great college standby.  Holy Moley!!! We played tons of Canasta into the wee hours.  Just think what could have been accomplished had I been studying that whole time!  I honestly don't think I've played since then, but the great memories of friends and laughter continue to live.  [Market price]

I like the Bolivia version of Canasta the best. My grandmother taught me this game in my early teens. Basically, once my hands were big enough to hold all of the cards. It's best with four people, and plays well with two, but stay away from three. One person gets raked over the coals with three.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I would enjoy this game much more if not for the swingyness of the red 3s and the jokers (and to some extent, the 2s). The red3s are free points to whichever team is lucky enough to draw them, while the wilds are worth the most points and are the strongest cards. Late in the game, drawing some jokers early and the other team drawing none, can be the decider.

That coupled with the rich get richer scheme of drawing form the discard, can turn this game into an exercise in frustration, where every turn you are forced to discard a card that the other team can draw, all because they got lucky early on and you didn't.

This is not to say there is no skill in this game. There is. And the better team will win more often than not. But I'd rather play games that didn't have those frustrating elements.

New comments: a lot less game here than i remembered from childhood. Really not much going on at all. Sad.

Comments from old 7 rating:This is a sentimental rating. I don't play at all anymore (although I probably would enjoy it). But I used to play all summer long with my Oma and aunts. Oddly, I think I would have difficulty trash talking if I played with English speakers since I've only ever played with German speakers.

RATING: 7
One of the better card games played with a standard deck, though I dislike how games between equally skilled players come down to the luck of the draw...really, that could be levelled at most games, but the luck of the draw is very significant in this, as having a run of safe discards is really the difference between winning or losing this game, and most of that comes down to the draw, though card counting is also essential to that end. Like many card games finding people who like to play your favourite version of it can be a chore but it's a fun game and I played it religiously for a while. 

At one point I would have listed this as one of my favourite games, as I had a couple of "eternal" games going with friends, but after having delved into the newer card game offerings from the Euro companies it's hard for me to get excited about Canasta. That said, if you want to play something that is Rummy-esque this is the best thing that I've found because of the higher skills involved. Also nice in that it plays well with 2, 3, or 4 (partnerships), though I would opt for Wyatt Earp over this when I have 3 at the table now.

I might also note that I despise variations like Samba which allow players to play straights, it makes protecting the pile completely impossible in most cases and it feels like it adds yet another random element to the game, unless your memory is Rain Man-esque.

I learned this sweet game from my Grandfather. I can not tell you how many times I have played this game. It was one of the great things about hanging out with him, he loved card games. We played a five deck variant that went on for hours and produced some great action. Not to mention his swear like sailor, play underhanded like a thief style really made things lively.

RATING: 6
An excellent [i]Rummy[/i] variant that is quick to learn but requires some thought to play well.  [i]Canasta[/i] doesn't play as fast as 500 (my favourite card game) but satisfies the itch when I'm looking for something a little heavier (but not too heavy).

Idea:
Collect same numbers from doubledeck of cards. Battle over discard stack to control game.

Mechanism:
Draw card/discard stack if you can reveal same pair as discarded just, play cards to table, discard card. 
Best with 2 teams of 2 players but playable 1vs1 or 1vs1vs1

to who:
Those who like normal card games, mostly relies on ability to play with together with your partner and remember what has been discarded and count odds. See also Samba

Behind Gin Rummy in the Rummy games.  A good parternship game with four people.  I would rather play Pinochle for a medium serious game, and Bridge for a serious game if playing a partnership game.  I rate it on equal terms with Rook and Spades, but Canasta is a good parternship game without trick-taking.

I learned Canasta because I always disliked rummy games, and wanted something to like in that family of games. So once I learned it, I taught it to three of my roommates at three in the afternoon, and we continued to play it for 18 hours straight, pausing only for a trip to the toilet and for a drink of coffee. We much enjoyed the megalomaniac spirit of the game, gaining gigantic points and melding several canastas, getting huge points in the process. It is our main game to this day.

My parents play this regularly, and they seem to love it.  Whenever I play it, all I can think of is that it's all about being able to get "red 3's".  If you get "red 3's" when you're able to get a canasta, you win.  If you get "red 3's" when you can't get a canasta (like, all 4 of them for -800 points), you lose.  I call it "oh, the game where if we get lucky with the 'red 3's', we win?!  Sure, I'll play that until we lose."  There's simple strategy, but when competent players play, it's pure luck that decides the winner.

I love this game because of it's complexity and it's strategy.  It's not overly complicated like bridge, where I just couldn't quite get the hang of the bidding.  The game can sometimes get really tense in trying to keep the discard pile from your opponent.  This is more fun in pairs, but I play it just with my wife a lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played often among in-laws.  Not bad and perfectly enjoyable, but could be more strategic.  What strategy there is revolves around the discard pile - when to freeze, when and what to sandbag to lure the opponent into discarding appropriately.  Red threes are particularly random, as are sambas.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rated on two-person game. High scoring and exciting.  The main element appeared to be controlling the discard pile (keeping track of and preventing opponent from getting a large or good one). Probably more fun in partnership.  Ticket to Ride is just "Canasta with a board," no?

A very good card game. Much simpler rules than Bridge. As many card games, it is a mix of reflection and memorizing. Can be very tense. A bit like in Tichu, you must make tough decisions, balancing team and individual strategies. I don't play too well though for I do not like to memorize everything.

Great game for those interested in a very challenging round of cards.

You will need card holders and a tray. Plus, crib sheets with rules for beginners and a copy of Hoyle's to settle disputes.

Canasta is the opposite of Hearts

Decent classic card game that works well with the family but is too luck dependent for my taste these days plus there is a big runaway leader factor that can frustrate some people. Rating has a little nostalgia in there as I really played tons of it as a kid.

I like this game, but it can drag on, especially when you are down by hundreds of points and already know how things are going to turn out but still have a couple of rounds left to get through. We used to play it more often back before we learned about the many new board games out there. I still like it, but I'd usually pick something else nowadays. I definitely like this game best with 4 players. When it's just 2, it can get pretty frustrating for the person who's down by hundreds of points and doesn't even want to finish the game. And when you have more than 4 players, it takes forever.

I own two ordinary decks of cards, therefore I 'own' canasta, poker, rummy, go fish, old maids.... the list is endless, and probably shouldn't be on BGG unless there's a notable published version.

I liked how it had more strategy and complexity than Rummy and the mechanics encouraged trying to predict what other people were going for. It lacks the level of strategy of good euro's, the length to interesting decision ratio is off, and seating order can mess it up sometimes (I forgot why). 

Still decent and if I was with non-gamers who wanted to play a traditional card game I would play it again.

It works but offers little over Mah Jongg.  The game is most interesting played to the full 5000 and in partnerships: then the strain of making the opening meld of 120 really begins to tell and can leave one partner effectively out of the running for the hand.  Without the wide player base and easy nostalgia, there would be little to recommend this game I think.

RATING: 5
Sorry, relatives.  I'll play this, I just don't love it.  It's *very* long (often >2 hours), and it seems that the primary skill is just paying attention to what's on the table.  Sure, every once in a while there's a tough decision as to what to discard, but usually you're just tossing down another black 3.  I can think of dozens of games we could play three times in a row in the time it'd take to play Canasta -- *and* we'd have more fun!

Rummy is one of my absolute favorite games of all time.  You might expect that I would enjoy Canasta as well.  While I have played many, many games of Canasta over the years, it is no longer a game that I would say I enjoy.  The games we played devolved into deck-locking marathons that were broken at random by the luck of the draw.  Not to mention occasional shafting when trying to make the initial meld.  While I will play on occasion, it is not a game I would ever suggest.  I would also probably play with some of the many variations that exist out there.

I've grown a distaste for Rummy games, but as a partnership game it adds more to the mix and actually makes for a quite pleasant experience.  It can have some big swings and can be a little nasty which is fun.  It is a little long and has quite a bit of luck, but when playing with a family that's into it, it can be fun.  

One of the few games I'll still play with a standard deck of cards, but only if there is nothing else around.

I can't think of a reason to recommend this set collection game. Essentially you draw a card, play any melds and then discard a card. If you make a meld using the top card of the discard pile then you pick up the whole pile. Too long, too much luck, silly scoring, limited decisions all combine into a game about waiting for that one mistake. 

If you like this sort of thing then Samba or Bolivia at least offer more interesting choices.

Lots of family plays for this one, but a good deal of year behind. Nowadays is basically forgotten, but it did make for some nice hours in several occasions, not only at home, as also in downtimes of vacations.

I would be definititely want to play again (not always, though). Still, it was surpassed by lots of better games that clock in around the same amount of time.

Still, Canasta has merits, tension, and the team play can make for some nice twists and smart plays.

However, for traditional card games, it loses to Hearts as my favorite.

I played this game a ridiculous amount between the ages of 12 and 15 or so, when I was absolutely in love with it.  I'm a bit more jaded now...  Most of the fun and strategy was in managing the discard pile--we had several (perhaps non-standard) rules about when you could and couldn't pick up the pile, involving black threes, wild cards, and distinctions between cards-in-hand and those already melded.  The most fun hands were when both players were actively trying for the discard pile, building tons of tension and culminating in huge game-changing scoring swings.

The thing that finally soured me on the game was a friend that realized that "conservative play wins the day".  And indeed it does.  And makes the game essentially random (if both players play conservatively) and a lot less fun.

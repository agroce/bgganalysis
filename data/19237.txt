It's not deep, it relies heavily on your sense of humour and you will grasp all the possibilities it has to offer in about five minutes, but, with the right crowd, this game can be a really fun filler.
It throws you right in the middle of an action movie, with dangerous criminals that are going to split the loot. Eight rounds to play: you can shoot three times and take at most 2 wounds (on the third one you're out). The fellow gangster that it's pointing his gun at you is really going to shoot or is just bluffing? Consider the amount of money that will be split among the survivors, the wounds that everyone has sustained so far and the look in the eyes of your "colleagues": take your risks or withdraw in shame.
Throw in Superpower cards and an undercover cop to make everything even more fun, with playing time that rarely goes over half an hour.
5-6 players seems to be the sweet spot for this game. With 4 it doesn't seem to have the same tension and don't even try to play it with less than that.

I made my own version, and I must say that customizing this game has been at least as much fun as playing it.

A great party game. Point fake guns at your friends and try to take the most money. What is cooler than that? This is a great game for gamers and non-gamers alike.

The game box includes rules for a couple of variants but we have not got to them yet.

Ca$h ‘n Gun$ is a hilarious bluffing game suitable for parties as well. What I like to most is that the game offers a lot of meaningful decisions for being such a light one. Especially the decision whether to chicken out of a round can be agonizing.

In the right group this game is great. However, I must warn that there is a chance that some players will take the game too personally (you are pointing a gun at them after all). Moreover, if one player gets targeted all the time thus being either denied from getting any loot or being eliminated, can the experience for that individual player be a really sour one. Getting eliminated means a bit of wait for that player since the game does not end immediately but it is still tolerable. And an early elimination is not very likely to occur. Best with more players.

RATING: 4.5
+ Just wild, silly good times can be had while holding up friends at gun-point.
- There really isn't much strategy to be had here; Everyone can just gang up on you every time and kill you no matter what you do if they so choose.


Why it's previously-owned:
Once the novelty of the foam guns wears off, most people were very ho-hum about the game.  After the first couple of "draws!" I was just waiting to get to the end of the game.
I traded this away in a large group for Dragon Valley and the Asara expansions.  We now have Libertalia for the quick, fun, game to pull out with our group.

Fun because you can play it so quickly (and work out any grudges from heavier games played before) but ultimately pointless and mostly devoid of strategy. The bits are nicely done though.

Gets much better with the cop variant though!

RATING: 7
I like this one!  A fun big-group game.  It's petty, vindictive and you get to point foam guns!  Game mechanics are *very* easy and gameplay is pretty fast.  For extra fun, add in the Yakuza expansion.  (Who brings a knife to a gunfight?  Honestly!)

6/11/08:  Rating lowered from 8 to 7.  While a fun party game and particularly suited to larger numbers of players (we once played a 10 or 12-player game with 2 copies of the base set), at heart it's a random game.  Fun, yes.  Controllable outcome, not so much.  The reason it rates as high as it does is because it's as fun as it is.  (Mmm... pointing orange foam guns at people...)

RATING: 6.8
A good game of bluffing & shooting.  Players in this game are all trying to get the same loot from a previous activity (bank robbing?).  Everyone puts a card down indicating whether they will shoot or bluff and then points their gun at another player.  If a player gets scared they can choose not to take their share of the loot, but they could risk it and see if the other player is bluffing.  Three hits and you are dead, so usually people will back down pretty often.  It plays very quick and the character abilities are pretty good, but this game gets old fairly quickly, I will most likely only play it in spurts.

Pros
- Pointing a gun at someone's face and seeing their reaction
- Bluffing, lying, and intimidation 
- Second guessing others

- Killing someone is hilarious 
- Special powers included for replayability in the future
- Accessible to non-gamers
- Brings out smiles and laughter 

Cons

Super fun, lightweight game that plays exceptionally well with non-gamers.  It only takes one round for new people to understand the simplicity of the rules and then it rapidly becomes a free-for-all or bluff and counter-bluff.

So glad to have found another go-to party/ filler type game to bring out to any crowd.  The rules are light enough to be taught and understood by non-gamers, and the psychological aspects of the game (of the did he really play a bang or not?) make it fun for regular gamers seeking lighter affair.  Plays fast and the idea of pointing guns at a lot of your friends and family always brings in the laughs.

Overall, like Incan Gold on steroids, Ca$h 'n Gun$ delivers a fun, over-the-top push your luck experience for everyone to enjoy.

Rating based on two plays.

I didn't like it quite as much as I expected and I wouldn't be surprised if this rating dropped.  

It probably depends on the group, but the pointing foam guns at each other and trash-talking didn't end up as fun as it sounded like it would.  

The game also seemed to end too quickly, and the actions of one round (who targeted who & whether the gun was loaded) didn't seem to influence enough the actions that occurred in later rounds.  In other words, it was really chaotic and I didn't feel like it was possible to make a crafty play.

Hmmm...certainly has a big fun factor (pointing the guns at each other, at least if the crowd is in the right mood). It was one of the games people were immediately interested in - spending a while just taking the guns and posing, or doing fake duels.
But somehow, the basic game grows old after a few plays. The "super powers" don't really improve things - but I'll have to see whether the advanced undercover agent rules will improve things.

Played this with dart guns, Water pistols, BB guns, monopoly money (in the RA bag) and poker chips (for the wounds and shame tokens). Got the spliting rules wrong but still had a .... blast... :)
Would like to get a copy but it's pretty expensive for what it is here in NZ

Update: Played the actual game at "Board Games by the Bay Auckland" we used the police variant and it was fantastic managing to win as the policeman!

Played a few times at Wellycon 2013 and won as the policeman again. Great fun!

Seems to be either massively good fun or a massive miss depending on the gaming group. Pretty silly and pointless until you have all the rules in, at which point it suddenly becomes more deep and meaningful that you ever expected!

This game is a lot of fun. It might not be very strategic, as you never know when all the other players will point their guns at you at the same time, but there is actually some good measure of "groupthink" to go with this chaotic nature.

Plus, firing a bullet at a friend was never this fun!

Quick, fun party game.  Cmon! You get to shoot people.  Onlookers want to join it because of the foam guns.  Very easy to teach as well and quick enough to play several games in a row.

Well, the game is certainly very light.  Really there is no strategy or any depth to it.  Just point guns to each other and shoot.  I guess you can try and bluff about it but since you don't know how many people are going to be pointing at who certainly just makes the game very chaotic.  The saving grace is that it is very quick.  The best things going for this game is the gun pointing and very quick rounds.  Also, the game gets even better if the players get in character.  Certainly, I had fun playing it but it will get old quick.  I wouldn't mind playing the game once in a while, more than that I will get very bored.  This game falls right in between 6 and 7.

A fun party game. You get to point your "gun" at your friends. What more could you ask? and it doesn't even require reading the manual! I would like a bit more suspense in the 5 banknotes, probably increased banknotes range (e.g. 5-50) in order to provide handlers for more predictable behaviour. Would like to try the expansion as well.

Similar to Hoity Toity in its mechanics, but is a bit weaker than that game because there's a bit more of a luck element in how the money is split or not split.  However, it's always great to play with the fake guns.  The undercover cop variant is the only interesting way to play the game.

Very light but fun and action packed game. If you think shooting your friends will create some bad feelings don't worry too much. The game is so quick that you just start over and hope for better luck next time. Esspecially good with some trash talking at the table. The variants add some additional ways too play the game but I like the pure game of chicken the best.

Just repetitive and not very enjoyable.  The special powers are helpful, but don't add much fun to the game.  It's too easy to gang up on people.  Overall it's just not the greatest game, but still a goofy time of pointing foam guns at each other is always going to make your group chuckle.  But once the chuckle wears off there isn't much game left.  There just aren't any interesting decisions to be made on each turn.

Everyone who plays Cash and Guns loves it: I wish I could as well but every time I try this game it annoys me even more than it did the last time. (September 2011)

[b]Update[/b] - Looks like the second edition’s more streamlined rules (and a very loud, light-hearted group) can make wonders with this game, turning it from the mess it used to be into the better game - or, as I should call it, long filler - it is now. It’s lots of fun now!

As I haven’t played it since then, my updated rating (an 8) is for the second edition only.

One of the best party games out there.  I break it out mostly with family and friends...not gamers.  Everyone I show it to becomes semi obsessed with it.  It's a simple bluffing game, but the gimmick of pointing foam guns at one another sends it over the top.  I like the extra variants and goodies you can add to make the game more or less complex.  I'll never part with my first edition because I adore the artwork.

Does exactly as advertised. Ultimately a game of bluffing and risk-management, with plenty of interactivity.

Still want to play with variable player powers a bit more to see if they add or subtract to the game.

Initial Thoughts: Good party game... some special powers seem more powerful, partially because of their ability to be used in more points in the game than others. I really dont know if this rating will go up or down after future plays, but I definitely want to play it some more, so that's a good thing. 

Updated Thoughts: This is more a gimmick game to me. No desire to play.

It is distrubring-ly fun to point foam guns at people.

I Love this game! And hope to get my hands on the expansion. Played this over the holidays and had a blast. However choosing your ammo cards to play was not as fun as drawing them at random. Made the game even more interesting and fun!

A silly free-for-all game that works very well. Only very rarely someone is eliminated early in the game (and even than the game doesn't take so long that it would be a big problem.) The winner is decided by a mix of luck and social skills, as in guessing when the other players play their bang or in intimidating a player to duck under the table. The special abilities also sometimes give the opportunities for clever plays.

Great game.  This is a funny and enjoyable game - player elimination isn't as important as in games like Bang! as the gameplay is fast and furious.  One of this games real strengths is in the fact that it plays quickly.

The concept is better than the execution of it I think.  I still think this one would be fun with the right crowd, although I'm not sure it's good to play this one with gamers.. unless they can just relax for a bit and go with the flow.  Definitely would shine in a party environment, and I really like the scaling of the rules, as well as the high quality components.

Finally got to play with the cop variant.  It makes the game even better.  Definitely want to play it that way whenever I can.

RATING: 6
Seemed a bit too random when we played with a full table. From reading rules and reviews I really expected folks to be a little more tactical in their target selection. But it pretty much came down to, "who would be the most fun to point a foam gun at" for most folks. That's unfortunate, because it really could be a lot more interesting. I'll give it another try sometime to see if it was just a fluke.

I will revisit my rating once I get some more plays under my belt. It's a good game. Pointing that foam gun across the table is a hoot. I've only played with the special power cards once and haven't gone beyond that. I'm sure this will be hitting the table when the right number of people are here (and the right crowd). I played with my regular gaming group who likes meaty games, and although we had fun, we decided to put it away after a single round.

I'm not a big fan of "take that!" games, and this one wasn't much of an exception.  The foam guns are a neat and novel idea, and a gimmick that draws a lot of attention to the game, but it just doesn't add enough to make me want to play it all that much.

If you can really get into the role-playing aspect and be totally sold on theme, you can probably really enjoy this one.  It just wasn't my kind of fun.

Fun party game that is light and focuses around the calling of your opponents bluff and judging their intentions.

The game is a fair bit random, but that doesn't lessen the enjoyment.  I would heavily recommend you start using the included Super Power cards after a couple plays as this varies the game up and adds substantial replayability. 

We haven't tried the Cop variant yet but are looking forward to it.

This is great fun whichever version you play. Whether you have special abilities and an Undercover Cop or either one. Point your gun at someone knowing if you have loaded your gun or not. Find the undercover cop before he rings for backup and eliminate him/her. 9 Plays.

Family and non-gamer friends love this game, I guess because they can point guns at each other and it be ok.  It starts off a little clunky and it seems once everyone gets the hang of the game it is over.  It has led to some funny moments and is best with as many people as possible.

A favorite of our group. How is getting to point guns at your friends NOT fun? This is a fun game to play at conventions, etc., as it always gets strangers to come join in.

This is absolutely one of those games that's just about getting into the spirit of the thing. There's not really a good way to guess whether or not someone is bluffing - you can pay attention to what cards they've played and deduce what they have left, but most of the choice on whether or not to back down comes from what you think your friends will do and whether or not you think the loot split is worth the risk. I can see why this doesn't appeal to some people, but it totally appeals to me. Fun for roleplay, etc.

Not really worth playing with 4, better with 5, best with 6.

The cop variant is too fiddly for such a light, silly game. Would have been better as a spinoff or something, but it just kind of feels half-assed here.

Includes Black Shotgun.

Update: 2nd ed streamlines this a great deal and ups the player count to 8. But I do really miss the Bang Bang Bangs from this one - the bluffing element is simply more fun in v1. I'm conflicted.

So much in fact that one neighbour called out to us the next day shouting "cojones" and waving...

This has been a big hit with both my family and my friends! Have only played it with at least 5 players and I don't think it works with a lower amount, but it's a joy when playing with 6 (and more if you have the Yakuzas expansion and use those rules or just use ordinary rules). I like how you can gradually increase the difficulty by introducing special powers and I also like that there is sort of an expansion included in the Police officer variant. 

My only gripe with this game is that I simply cannot win it as I'm always targeted because I win many other games so people don't want me to win. I've actually only won this game once... It doesn't really botter me though as it's a nice game with lots of laughs and backstabbing and trash talking during this great party game!

RATING: 6
After two plays, this is simply a blast. Who cares if you win when everyone is sitting around the table laughing. A few people gave this game a sideways glance until they actually sat down to play it. Then they "got it." 

Pointing foam guns at other people is just downright fun.

Update: downgraded to a "7," but I still think this is a good game for what it does. Guaranteed to cause chuckles and laughter, and that's definitely worth something. It's very random, but I appreciate it as a "warm up" game. It really is preferable with 5 to 6 people.

Downgraded it to a "6." Part of my initial enthusiasm was the sheer novelty of this game. I'm glad I own it. It's a blaring example that games are supposed to be fun. But, after a play or two, people move on to other stuff. I'll bust this out for new people (or possibly when inebriated!), but the glut of "super fillers" that I've recently picked up means this won't hit the table as often.

Update: Well, after still sitting on my shelf, I finally traded it away along with Wits n Wagers for Nuns on the Run. It's a good game, and I'm glad to have owned it, but at least for my group, there's not much longevity or game in it once you get past the first couple of plays.

This is a fun game that fills a vaguely similar niche to Bang!  It works well with different numbers of people, though, so I like them both.  It also moves faster than Bang! which is nice, but I find that it gets more repetitive quicker.  Still, pointing foam guns at people in "Resevoir Dogs" style showdowns is just fun.  A great game for the casual gamers among us.  Also probably fun for games days and the like.  Very simple rules, all the choices are just from bluffing - very little strategy, and it works better with groups that are less stuffy and can brandish guns with flourish.  Maybe a good game for before the D&D game starts.

Talking about this game and the rules explanation for this game were a lot more fun than actually playing turned out to be. I also have to be honest that the theme to this one is a little bit past some kind of line for me, where we're pointing cut-out guns at each other. I don't morally object, but I also find it just a little bit disturbing. Once the initial humor wears off, I wish it had a more innocuous theme.

I've played the vanilla version and I've played with special roles. The special roles are not well balanced, although theoretically over the course of the game the person with the better role would be targetted more often...so perhaps that's not such a big deal. 

The group I played with didn't do a whole lot of negotiation, which is probably important to the game and might raise it a bit in my rating...but probably tops out at 6. I liked it better without roles. I really dig the "shame" mechanic where you lose face (and the equivalent of money) for dropping out if you feel threatened. I like that you can get killed with 3 wounds, although getting eliminated early sucks. But if it happens, its kind of your own gamble for staying in when you knew you were targetted.

In execution (no pun), it just felt like the whole was less than the sum of its parts, somehow.

A HELL of a lot better, more interesting, and fun than Bang, Werewolf, Shadows Over Camelot or any of those other horribly overrated "group plus a traitor" games and it's a nice punch in the face to the cliched glad-handing "everybody can win" nonsense that Eurogames tend to feature.  This is a nasty game in the vein of Intrige so if you're not in for elimination, hurt feelings, having a foam gun pointed at your face, and torrential bad language then I'd advise you stay at the Elfenland table and move the l'il booties around with the magic clouds.  There's definitely a game here, particularly if you play with the superpower rules and the cop, which adds a secret role and a great suspicion/deduction element.  The game is very simple (taught in 5 minutes) and every game is filled with immediacy, drama, and lots of laughter.  The French-style comic art is a little silly but it's appropriate and the foam guns are, well, easily replaced by 1:1 replica Airsoft pistols for maximum impact.  Definitely the most FUN Euros I've played in a long while- it's not terribly original systematically, but the theme and concept are one-of-a-kind.   I will say though, that the experience suffers when you play with people who are too timid to drop the F-bomb or engage in torrential sh*t-talking- I've played with groups that giggle sheepishly every time the guns are pointed and it's a sad, sad sight.  One of my favorite games.

First release.  An absolute all time favorite party game.  If you like being noisy and have a blast, this takes the cake.  Make sure you have a group that enjoys bluffing and cross table trash talking because that's half the fun.  I prefer the artwork and the money setup more in the first edition.  Rather than fighting over cards everyone shares, having to leave money you can't divvy up on the table for an ever growing pot can drastically change the games' dynamic and make later heists all the more lucrative and tense!  Always requested at bigger game night get-togethers.  Best played with max players.

Just played 5 games... 4 players, all new to the game. This was the biggest out-of-the-box hit I've ever seen! A raucous, trash-talking, in-your-face ROCKIN' good time! I expect that this will see a LOT of table time in the future and my rating could easily climb to a 10.

UPDATE: This just doesn't hold up (as well as I expected it to) under repeated plays by the same group. It's still fun and entertaining, but now is more likely to be pulled out only when introducing new people (non-gamers) to the group. The regulars in the group (including myself) just aren't as enthusiastic about this as they once were.

Just love the moment when you have to point your gun at someone.  I never know who I should point at, but I always have fun.

As for the variants.  I like the superpowers, but some are more fun than others.  It really sucks having an uncool superpower and then have someone else pick the grenade or something else fun.

The police variant is super cool.  I had been reluctant to try it, as it seemed complicated, but now that I have it changes the whole game.  Now you have someone to try and gun down.  At least for me it was really fun and I will prefer to play with it from now on.

Acquired in Math trade June 2008.

Oh what a fun game this is!  Nothing is better than bluffing on whom to target and then turn on your buddies with a bang card.  The only thing that makes me hesitate on owning this one is the gun theme which doesn't make it very family/kid friendly.  

I picked it up in a Math trade to play with adults and for when my kids get older.  Had a blast playing this with various gaming groups and will always suggest it with a larger crowd.  However, the gun/gangster theme was a flop for the wife and was encourage to trade away.

a good quick filler - fun - but only a filler.

the game plays very quickly and you can probably only cope with two at a time.

there is more to the game than you would imagine. It is quite psychological and timing is crucial.

This is all about trash talking and "roleplaying" your character. I was amazed how well it went down with the ladies, who after the initial round to learn the rules quickly came to be the meanest and most ruthless of the lot. Light and whacky fun to start or finish a game night.

I had already played one game of Cash'n'Guns at a local Board Games Café and we had a blast. It's so simple but the fact you can goof around with the foam gun makes it extremely funny with the right people!

Fast, frenzied fun. Great light game for when you're waiting for other folks to show up. Keeps energy levels up. I'm curious to see how well adding players partway through plays; I suspect that it'll work adequately, despite not being strictly balanced. Have not yet played with police snitch or with powers; don't feel a strong need to use either, yet.

RATING: 8
Great Game, but only with 5 or 6 players using the undercover cop rules. At 4 players or less, I would rate the game closer to a "5".  There is just not enough exchange between players if not using the cop rules. Also, I highly recommend using the unique abilities.

RATING: 5
Components: The foam guns are easy to handle and point; all the tokens are functional; the character cards are humorous, though not my style of art.

Experience: The basic game is simple and fun. Players must make calculated moves, deciding whether they think others are bluffing, and whether the risk is even worth it, given what's in the pot at the time. I like the natural catch-the-leader aspect, which then allows someone else to slowly increase their wealth.

The advanced game with the cop (but without the special power cards) is entirely different. Money no longer seems to matter, but rather it is a desperate game of survival, deduction, and argument. It does seem rather akin to the movies wherein the criminals argue about who the informant is, but I think I prefer the deceptionless, everyone-for-themselves aspect of the basic game.

Excellent family game.  I read some reviews online and watched a couple videos of sample gameplay and knew I'd love this game.  It hasn't disappointed.  Takes less than 5 minutes to explain the basic game to new players.  Includes some fun advanced variations to keep things interesting for experienced players.  Seriously tempted to buy another copy so we can play the 12-player variation.

This rating may change drastically. I've played a few games and it exceeds my expectiations. There is a role in the advanced game that can make it more like Werewolf/Mafia, which is always a plus. Can't wait til weekend to show more friends. The orange guns are a big deal for some of us game nuts on this site, but others didn't mention them at all. When I mentioned it, one even mentioned the safety aspect. (Blame stupid American cops and lets spray-paint everything we may ever hold in our hands "safety orange".)

Better with a larger group.  One of a large class of "Don't pick on me!" games.  It's not one of my favorite classes of games.  It adds bluffing ("Is my gun loaded, or not?"), and how the money can be divided can help inform your choices.  A great game if you like pointing guns at your fellow players!

RATING: 7
Great light game that works for both gamers and non-gamers alike. The foam guns are brilliant fun. The back stabbing and trash talking really plays into the whole feel of the game. In a way, the game has a lot of similarities to Family Business in this respect. The re-released version, after going out of print for a while, now has orange guns, an unfortunate side effect our our litigious society. Booo...

Follow-up: Replay-ability really drops off quick. Plus game play is really dependent on players getting into the meta gaming side (laughing, joking, threatening, etc.) It really needs the party atmosphere to shine.

A whole lot of fun to be had with this game.... with the right group. There is actually very little "game" here but it's the interaction it creates between players that makes it great.

I'm really, really bad at deduction games. When I was a kid, my sister and I went to visit our friends Amy and Patricia way out in bumblefook, like 30 miles from any form of real civilization. I remember, to this day, a horrible game of [gameid=1294] we played with them one time. I really didn't grasp the rules at all and no one was really willing to explain them to me, but I played anyway. I can't remember the exact details, but someone else won and it turns out that I should have been able to win several turns earlier, but I was too stoopid realize it. They laughed at me for days and I probably never really got over it. I think this game and [gameid=915] have let healing begin and I hope that some day, I can muster the courage to play a game of [gameid=1294] again. Short of that, I guess I could just show up at their house and punch 'em in the neck.

A nice crazy fun game with good people to play it with.  I don't like the Cop rule though because games with a one vs all mechanic have bad mojo.  Either the single guy wins, and everybody is left annoyed that what they were doing didn't matter, or the single loses and feels like he wasn't even in the game that everyone had fun with.  The special powers are good though since they just change stuff up nicely to make a little asymmetry.

Fun, silly, "take that" game that's good for a few laughs. Nothing like pointing a foam gun at someone's head.  If you're looking for fun filler, this is a good choice. Don't think I'd want to play more than once (in an evening).

RATING: 8
Hilarious game where players are crooks just after a bank heist, about to divide up the loot.  Game is played over rounds, where each player plays a bullet card face down, then all simultaneously point a foam rubber pistol at one other player.  If a player has too many guns pointing at them they can fold out of the round, bullets are then revealed.  Live bullets wound players, knocking them out of the round.  All remaining players divide the pot for the round.  Additional rules for special powers, including a foam rubber shotgun that was being included at Essen.  The game is very amusing, and heavily influenced by Resevoir Dogs.

It's just fun to point the foam guns at your friends and family.  You have to know when to jump into the fight to try to make off with the money and when to duck for cover.

If you accept this game for what it is, braindead-late night-zero thought-hilarity, then it can be very fun. That being said, I will still only play this sparingly, and only if there is the right combination of people and personalities.

[b]1.11.10 Update:[/b] My rating goes down a tick since it is becoming more and more apparent just how small the right demographic of players is. Without the correct group of players (people not ashamed to point a gun at someone and trash talk till they cower or bust up in laughter), this game falls flat.

Fun game that rides on its gun props. I expect it would wear thin fast, since the game is essentially just chicken + multiple round scoring and some whack the leader.

Made mine from own materials, used the Reservoir dogs cards here, buy you own toy guns, money. Not as exciting as it sounds. 1st round really ramdon.  Variant : First 3 round each player draws 1 money each. hidden. : this gives more chance of 1 or 2 player not getting in on the kill the first few rounds.

RATING: 6
Played a few times. Quick filler. Can be very enjoyable with the right players. Chaotic.

3 lives each, try to get the loot each turn without going down or being hit with a bullet. Most money wins the game. 

Game is OK. Pointing at a random opponent is tedious. I mean one round you can have like 0 or 1 gun pointed at your direction, the next 3 or 4. So very little control.

Don't mind playing, but not something I would buy myself.

This is just plain FUN!  You can't take it too seriously, and it starts to get stale if you play it too many times in a row.  But for an occasional adrenalin boost during an evening full of strategy games, it's perfect!

Great fun, but you have to be willing to act out a little to get the most out of the game.  Trash talk, funny accents, gangster movie quotes, promises and backstabbing all add to the chaos.

2011-11-06 : Played a couple of times - the fun doesn't last
2014-11-03 : Played the second edition and like it even less than the original because you can get screwed time and again based on where you sit with regard to the godfather, not through any actions of your own. So 6 for the original edition, 4 for the new one. 
2016-11-27 : I was very pleased when the host who previously pushed the second edition on us said "you know, the first edition is much, much better - let's play that one" - it's still not a great game, but at least it's somewhat amusing.

just played this the first time on my brother's birthday - and yes it's even more fun than I thought it would be.In fact my mom became I huge fan of it within 5 minutes.I would love to know what the neighbours thought when they saw my mom with this little gun in hand ;)

I just didn't get this game at all. I mean, we played well by the rules, but I just didn't see the fun in it. Maybe I should see another group playing it and see what I missed in my play. I hoped I would like this one but it just didn't happen.
UPDATE:
Way better the second time I played.

RATING: 5
Not the highest rating but in this case, I think I only have myself to blame.  So far I've only tried the basic game which was kind of mediocre.  At the very least you do get the opportunity to point guns (albeit styrofoam) at your friends which has some merits.  I'm hoping after I try playing it with player powers and the secret role advanced game, I will enjoy it a lot more.  Until then, all I can say is that it's a decent game with potential.

RATING: 6
A quick filler with nice Reservoir dogs feel. Very enjoyable occasionally, but after all there isn't much of a game here so it will get boring quite quickly. And all the gun-pointing will offend some people.

Made a set for a friend as a birthday gift. We used bananas for guns. Great fun!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One has to be in the right mood to play this game - in a very silly gaming round this could rate much higher, as the guns score high on the "kid in us"-factor. Played seriously this is rather shallow, as all strategies basically fail if one of the other player just wants to kill you and points the gun at you every round. Surviving this game is not something you can achieve through skill, but mostly through luck, as will be the size of your money claim. Still, Kudos for original execution of a funny idea!

OK secret role game. Like many of these, the whose-whose role reveal part is muddied up with some side game. In this case it is collecting loot. Still, I'll take this over Resistance any day.

RATING: 5
This is a "blind-bidding on top of blind-bidding" game. You "blind bid" your bullet card, then you "blind bid" who you shoot. Sheer randomness with a major "whack the leader" component. The only good points? It is mercifully short and you get to point guns at people.

Chinese Version.

It's a shame that I had to go all the way to China to find a copy of this game that was affordable. It's a fun easy party/filler game that works best with 5-6 players. I'm not a huge fan of the imagery used for the female character (is that really needed?) but everything else is great. One problem with this game is that it can't really be played in   public settings due to the foam guns.

Luckily there is a new edition coming out soon and it will be pretty widely available then. It seem that the new producers have changed a lot of the core game though, so we'll see how it is later on.

The expanded rules with the "cop" is a must play.  Even with these expanded rules, the fun wears off after a couple of plays.

[1 play] Light fun game.  We played with the orange-guns edition.  I haven't seen the other one, but if the guns look real I don't think I would want to play.  An American viewpoint, no doubt; we're so conditioned (with good reason) to be wary of guns that it would creep me out to have what appeared to be a real gun pointed at me.

I thought the game would be funnier.  We played it with four people and it probably would play better with more.  I would give it another try with a different group.  Each round felt the same.  I think that including the different roles would improve the experience.

RATING: 7
Has been a huge hit every single time I've brought it out. People seem to love the "screw you" aspect; it lends itself well to holding grudges. Some of the special power cards are a bit unbalanced, but it's a minor flaw in a very fun game.

A few caveats, however: the game really shines with 5 or 6 players (not so much with 4), and the rowdier you get the more enjoyable it is. Copious quantities of alcohol also help.  This is not a game to play at the end of the evening when everyone is wiped; otherwise it will degenerate into a rote way of playing. Pick a card, count, point, count, duck, split, repeat. You want threats and negotiation and frustration being tossed around the table.

Also, I don't think I've ever won. There's a definite pattern of "pick on the owner," at least in my circles. 

[b]Update:[/b] Dropped from an 8 to a 7. Its fun is very dependent on the mood of the group. Also, I've found that Ca$h 'n Gun$ can suffer quite a bit from metagaming. I enjoy screw-you games as much as the next person, but it's difficult to play well when one or two people decide that even though you're in last place with no money, you're still the only threat on the table. That kind of play style is something that has always bugged me. Part of it is the players, but the game doesn't allow you to recover from a grudge match here; you're at the mercy of the whims of everyone else. My personal preference is to play a game to win; and barring that, to end up ranking as highly as I am able. Sacrificing position to enact revenge on players is a pet peeve of mine, and Ca$h 'n Gun$ (like Intrigue) isn't fun when you're on the receiving end of a concerted effort to make you lose.

However, everyone else seems to be just as enamored as the first time they played. I think my frustrations here stem from the fact that my playing style differs from several other people in my core gaming group. Take my rating with a grain of salt.

CnG was OK but not nearly as much fun as I'd expected. I'd been wanting to play this one for a long time but the novelty wore off quickly and the game petered out as it came down to one other player and myself. I'd rather play Pow Wow for a this type of player elimination game.

RATING: 5.5
Really enjoy this fun party game but it does require a large group to really shine.

It can also suffer from a run away leader problem as after a round or two players target those who targeted them rather than looking at play positions, but I really enjoy the psychological aspect of staring down the barrel of the gun pointed at your head as trying to figure out "did they load it? or are they bluffing?"

We have not tried the snitch variant yet but it looks interesting.

Humorous party game to start or end the evening.  I have no moral problem with it and don't think it is offensive.  Some people who initially expressed objections about pointing a gun at someone, asked to play again.  Played variations with the cards and the policeman, which added interest.  Good game to pull out once in a while for variety.

RATING: 7
Nice simultaneous game of hoodwinking thugs.  Grab what you can and dodge as many bullets as you need to.  Don`t get too rich too quickly if you can, because you tend to be a favored target.  The foam guns are overkill though; fingers would have worked just fine.

This is crazy fun and I have seen gamers get loud and excited during play, with all the gun-pointing actions. Can be compared to games such as BANG the dice game or even King of Tokyo. Playing with the cop/traitor advanced rule provides for a unique twist to an otherwise simple and fun game. Thus far, I actually like the 1st edition over the second, although I need to play the 2nd one a few more times to finally be able to provide a fair comparison.

Oozing with theme: people fall in love with it once sentence into the introduction. 

Like Bang!, but with simultaneous action selection, bluffing and ORANGE FOAM GUNS ftw! 

Tons of giggly fun and still interesting decisions - for a party game. 

The only drawback is people getting upset about constantly being targeted to be killed by everyone. So far though, playing with mostly newbies, everything just feels kind of random. 

Quote a roommate playing it for the first time: "Dangit, I didn't get enough buck for my bang!"

We all really 'get into' this game.  It really lets you get into character.  You can't really play it sitting down.  Every adopts their own gangster stance, and gangster mean face.  Lots of laughing... For the first couple plays, I was just pointing my gun randomly -- but there is some psycho-strategy involoved.  It almost has a similar push-your-luck feel as Incan Gold (Diamant).  It definitely has the same split-the-loot mechanic.  OH!  No matter how tempting it is, and how funny it's going to be, you're not allowed to duck behind another player and use her/him as a human shield!  Seriously.

Fun party-ish game where you are thugs who point toy guns at each other as you vie to split a pile of loot.

Entertaining.

Fun prop gun game (I can't believe I said that) which is just on the wrong side of filler in length.

There might not be anything particularly revolutionary about Cash 'n Guns, but as a social party game with a wicked theme, it is the brass tax! The level of bluffing and role-playing is so high that you can't help but enjoy this. Also, you will never get the kind of table talk in a negotiation/bluffing game as you will in C&G. The Power Cards add a hint of strategy that makes it stand beyond its "just a party game" category, and the inclusion of an undercover cop expansion makes the game feel complete.  And you can't help but not comment on the foam guns, albeit orange, that seal the deal.

A fun, light, bluffing game with foam guns.  Just seeing the guns for the first time coming out of the box was enough to convince me I would like the game, and as luck would have it I did.  The bluffing part was actually pretty light and I'm not sure anyone stayed in or dropped out of a gunfight based on what they thought another person was up to.  The roles played a small part in the game, but I'm not sure they're crucial.  In fact, only two that affected the game play were actually revealed.  While certainly not for everyone, its quick and the player elimination should typically occur only late in the game, so it's a solid filler or game to play with non-gamers.

A one trick pony (that trick being nice components).  There isn't much going on here, and unless you are of the rowdy, theatrical type there never will be.  Fun for the first round, repetitious and annoying after that.  It works, but it only truly works if you possess a specific personality.

I had some misgivings about this game (pointing guns at your friends in a town like Berkeley?), but they were blown away in that first Mexican standoff.  It's not a deep game by any means, but it's just plain fun.  The physical interaction involves you in the game more than moving bits around a board.  The roles add more depth to the game, but I don't think anyone was really playing to win as the most common reason for pointing at someone was "Because you shot me!"  People were more intent on having fun, and I think that says a lot about the game.

I had a blast playing this game.  Brings out the gangster in all of us.  Unfortunately, being the devious, crafty liar of the group, I had everyone aiming at me, but that's ok.  If you die, the game ends in 15 minutes, and all's good!

It's fun every once in a while, but definitely not a game I would play on a weekly basis.  Only on a monthly basis tops.  It gets a little too frantic and chaotic at times, which does result in a fun time, but doesn't encourage a serious gaming environment either.  This is a lighthearted beer and pretzels game with guns you can point at your friends.  If anything, that does make you want to try it at least once.

Beer and pretzel type of game which delivers what I expect it to deliver. What is good with this compared to e.g. Bang et al is that this is more fast paced and you will not get bored as fast with it. I fear that other players will want to play it more than I will though, since I cam see it will wear out. There isn’t that much to the game to have a real replayability and decisions seems to be quite arbitrary.

Four plays, once with the basic rules and three times including the undercover cop. There's not a whole lot of "game" in there, and I have to think it'll get old at some point, but still it's worth a few laughs if you're comfortable pointing a toy gun at the other people at the table (which I wasn't in every case, by the way).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Any time we get the chance for an especially long gaming session, this pops out at least once. It's really all about pointing the guns at eachother.

We recently devolved into a "Sudden-Death" variant where we removed the money, gave everybody a single hit point, and allowed stealing of guns upon death. The game somehow remained addictive enough to play over a dozen rounds like this.

While there aren't any real flaws (or if there are, we end up ignoring them because of how silly the game already is), but it gets stale upon repeat play, and since it only lasts about ten minutes, repeat play is all we have.

Pretty fun little party game that brings back the spirit of playing with toy guns and swords.  The yakuza expansion adds some different flavor and ninja star throwing!  Could easily be proxied with standard deck cards, toy guns (or just using fingers like a gun), play money, etc. once you know how to play.  

The USA versions with lame orange guns suck.  It's not Repos' fault, just stupid US nanny state dictating what color foam we can buy.

The racial caricatures are bound to offend some, especially those running about trying to be offended.  That's not to say any character is portrayed in a particularly flattering manner.  It doesn't bother me, but if you or people you'd play with might be, take a look at character art in the gallery before buying.

The basic game is still pretty lame, but having enthusiastic players makes it more fun. Adding the special power cards improved it as well.

More of a party game than a game of any real bluffing or strategy, it is still simple enough and quick enough to warrant playing. I have a lot of fun with this one, but I find it gets old quickly. I usually only want to play it one game at a time. The components are very nice looking (who doesn't want to play with a foam gun?) and it is very nice to have several different ways to play right out of the box. All in all, a good, brainless diverson, that lets you kill your friends without too many hard feelings.

The base game plays quickly as players chose one of their "ammo" cards (you start with 8, three of which are "loaded"), then simultaneously choose their target by pointing their guns, followed by the "Italian word" phase where players either decide to chicken out (lower then character card) or prononce the Italian word and stay up hoping anyone targetting him/her does not have a loaded gun.

After resolving the firing phase ("Bang, Bang, Bang" going first followed by the "Bang" cards), players still standing up divvy up the loot (only equal portions are taken, any remainder is left for the next round).  At the end of the 8th round, players add their loot, removing $5K per "Chicken" counter.

BTW, when someone gets shot 3 times he/she is out of the game, so sometimes it is best to duck and take the chicken counter.

The game is Ok to play, especially if players add in a bit of role playing.  Unfortunately, I find the price tag for this one to be way too high for a deck of cards, 6 rubber guns and a handful of counters.  Still a game I am willing to play if someone else has picked it up.

Playing with the first expansion adds a bit more spice, without complicating the game, nor slowing it.  Recommended.

This is a one hit wonder.. you play it, you point foam guns at each other & think, GREAT!
Then you realize there is no strategy.. none.. there's no way of knowing who will be pointing their gun at you & thus no way of choosing anyone over someone else as your victim.

Chances are, that if you're crazy about party games, like cards against humanity & munchkin, you'll probably enjoy this one.
Everyone else, better go for a walk in the early morning.

Great party game, as long as everyone knows how to swear like a nine-year-old FPS player and has a nutsack full of bile-spitting shrews.  You can't just point a foam rubber gun at someone and say "Tee-hee!  I will shoot you" and expect to get anything done.

You have to jam it in their eye and scream:

[o]"I will [i]fucking do you[/i], right here, right now—and then I'll do your [i]whole fucking family[/i], skin your kids and [i]whip your pets to death[/i] with their wet, knotted hides and then I'll do myself so we can all meet at my pleasure dome in the afterlife where [i]you are all my slaves[/i] and then I'll do you all again and so on forever unless you [i]drop.  The fucking.  Gun![/i]  Do it!  [i]Do it now![/i]"[/o]
My kids will never, ever see me play this game.

UPDATE:  Played with the kids (who are now all of age).  To my horror I find they are nasty, [i]nasty[/i] people.

Initial ranking 7.  We played 4p game and it was OK.  I think that Cash and Guns will work much better with 5/6, but this is the group that I had in mind while looking for this game.

We added power cards during our fourth game and it was a welcome addition.  So far, we have still played only 4p games and special powers gave made things more interesting.  I strongly believe though that the game needs 5-6 players.  

As expected, 5p game is much better than 4p.  We also like the variant with special powers.  Secret agent also helps to bring variety into this simple game.

Holy cow!  This game is just a blast when played with the right people (read: good friends, with adult beverages) and I always seem to do pretty well.  I haven't tried the "mole" variant with the telephone card passed under the table yet, but want to do so soon.
Edit:  I can't believe it took so long to play the "Cop in the Mafia" variant, but it's really fantastic and I think that's the way I'll mostly play anymore.  Not complicated at all, and adds a much needed "reason to shoot" to the game.

RATING: 6
1st played 2/7/08. Taught in <5min, played in ~30min. This has some strategy, however luck tips the scales. The object is to have the most $ after 9 rounds. Each player is given a "gun" & 9 cards. 6 cards have "click" on them & miss the opponent. 2 have "bang" on them & "wound" or "kill" the opponent. The last, has 3 "bangs" on them. The 3-bangs takes place before the opposing player if 2 are involved in shoot-out. First place 5 random cash cards ($5-20G) as loot for the round. Players secretly pick 1 card & then on the count of 3 pick someone to shoot. As you hold the guns each player "pointed at" is given the opportunity to back out of the round. If you back out, you get a "shame" token which is worth -$10G at the end of the game. Guns are lowered if pointed to players who backed out. After players back out (if any), players still pointing a gun turn over their cards & resolve cards. Click=miss, bang/3-bang=wound. Wounded players are also out of this round. The remaining players split up the money if it can be evenly split, otherwise it carries over to the next round. Once a player gets 3 wounds, he is killed & out of the game. Recommend gameplay as borrow, otherwise don't purchase(could probably "make" your own if desperate)

Print the rules, buy some toy guns, fake money, wound/shame markers, you have this game. Really under-rated party game, and will work with most groups. There is a bit of awkwardness at the beginning, this isn't a drinking game, but some alcohol along with Cash 'n Guns will take the edge off.

This game is too fun, way more than it has any right to be.  Sure it's gimmicky, but something about pointing foam guns at people and grimacing as you decide whether to back out or not when the bullets are about to fly is glorious. I really hope this game makes it to the states as it's a must own in my opinion.  The game is all fun in the playing and situational occurances, so if you're a die-hard control freak fixated on winning strategies - you'd do best to pass it up.

This is a game that is not meant to be serious...  It's basically a press your luck game in some regards...

And you can only take three bullets, so you have to guess properly or "die" trying...

An anti-speadsheet game.  This game is all about personal interaction.  Do you think your friends are bluffing?  What are the odds the three people pointing their guns at you will all misfire?  What about the one next to you with the shakey hands?

Even though my friends always gang up on me early in each game, I love playing this one.  It's a great game to start the evening because no matter if everyone is quiet and giggling softly because they are shooting their friends or if everyone is roleplaying their favorite Mexican standoffs, it gets people interacting and in a gaming mood.

Point your gun at people, bluffing, chaos, laughing, earn some mula and even some small decisions (on whether to "chicken out" or not and who to shoot and when).

Leg eerst gedekte kaart met losse flodder (klik), kogel (bang) of spervuur (bangbangbang). Tel tot drie en richt mousse pistool op willekeurige medespeler. Tel tot drie en vlucht eventueel.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (September 2010)

I have never liked the game very much; still I have to concede it is very fun with the right crowd.

The game components are stunning and add a lot to the fun. The rules are very easy and can be explained in less than two minutes. This is way better than Bang. The police variant is a must, otherwise the game loses a lot of fun. 

I’m generally the first player to get eliminated, but I don’t mind as the game plays so quickly. Still it is very random and has lots of uncontrollable luck. I feel the player whose is pointed the least (low profile) will win.  

Love the bluffing in the game, but there is no indication when a player is bluffing so it is very random too.

I won’t say no to a game of Cash and Guns, but it is not a game I would like to play often.

An OK game.  The novelty of pointing foam guns at other players wears off a bit on the third or fourth play, and the money divisions can feel very arbitrary.  It is short though, and usually good for a few laughs.  "Cop" variant recommended.

Downrating after hearing it suggested at a recent game night and recoiling.  Apparently I'm less enthused about the simultaneous action selection than even I thought.

My favorite party game. 

Edit: I raised the score because I've grown to enjoy it even more.

Edit 2: This time I've dropped the score a little because it is requested much less often, nowadays. It's still fun to play but I rarely play more than one or two games at a time. Originally, I could play several games at a time but it doesn't have the same hold, anymore.

A party game that would be better if it were played as a drinking game.  Take a wound... take a shot of your favourite alcoholic beverage.  It's probably the only way I'll ever play it game again.

This is a quick, interesting game of bluff. Foam pistols are a nice touch and using the special powers adds a twist to a basic game that's still fun.  Not a brain burner so people who enjoy a light game will get it.

Decent filler, not a game to be taken seriously.  If you can live with the non-seriousness and the random action of choosing who you point your gun at then you will have fun with this game.  NOT FOR THE SERIOUS GAMER.

Great party game or for when you don't want to be totally serious. Choose a firing option, aim at another player, have a chance to back out, and see who's left standing to collect the money left behind. Three shots you're dead, highest cash wins. Fast, quick — and very vindictive! :P

BIG PLUS: styrofoam guns to point at people (where else can you do that?)
MINUS: who are we kidding? it's gun-pointing time!

ESSENTIAL to all collections. This is the ultimate party game because it gets everyone involved with some laughs.

Quick social game where people point foam guns at other hoping to either scare them away or shoot them so that the surviving players get more loot. There isn't too much to the game really as guns are pointing and bullets and bodies are flying. 

The undercover cop variant adds a slight change to the game but is really not an easy task for the officer who must survive two rounds of guns firing and not getting himself shot or killed. With only 4 rounds in the game that's not easy to do.

I played one eight player game, and while I enjoyed it, I can see this getting old fast. Point your guns at people. Hope they don't point theirs at you. Hope that if they do, the gun isn't loaded.

You play a card at a time that either allows you to shoot another player or bluff. Then everone points their gun at another player. You can wimp out if too many are aiming at you. You then get a penalty and none of the pool of money. Three shots and you are out, so you to need to guess when people are bluffing or just get lucky to stay in sometimes and get more money. It is really just a silly fun game.

Este juego me encanta. Los jugadores son gangsters que quieren repartirse el botin de un atraco. Para "negociar" el juego viene con unas pistolas de goma espuma para amenazar a los rivales y hacer que renuncien al botín. ¿Será un farol o el arma estará cargada? ¿Quién será el policia infiltrado?

Quite fun, and there's more of a game in there than it appears by simply reading the rules.  The way the money needs to be split evenly can really make things interesting.

It's better than most party games I have played. For example, it is much faster and makes more sense to me than the somewhat similar Bang. You can play it a couple of times in an evening and you will be done in less than half an hour. The funnier and more outgoing the people at the table the better it will be. Just don't play it in a public place - the foam guns look silly close up but not from a distance.

Well, well, well.  This one hit my group just right.  Introduced to me by gaming partner, Homiefud, we had a blast with our first few games.  I introduced my copy to 2 other parties, played several more times and still...had a blast!
The rating could go down if not played with the right people...I mean, if you can't have fun, get rambuctious, curse and be cutthroat, this one isn't for you.  And I wouldn't want to play with you anyway ;)
With the "right" group, could be an 8.5...with the "wrong" group, could fall to a 5...
Luckily, I am in a great group!

The Good: Good theme - who can say no to a game where you are gangsters and point guns at each other ? Plays fairly short. Quite a bit of variants - superpowers and/or one cop in the basic game, and now a whole expansion !

The Bad: Talk about conflict - people are pointing guns at you, and you very well could end up out of the game due to said people. Those that hold grudges or take things a little too personal should steer clear. As mentioned, people can be "eliminated" from the game early. However, the game is short enough that it is not a real problem.

This game is fun but very basic.  It really does just boil down to who gets pointed at the most.  You can't win by bowing out if every gun is pointed at you every time.  Of course, winning is not the fun of this game.  It's really just about bluffing and trash talking, so you need a group that's happy to do that.

Everyone likes pointing a gun at each other. I added red smashed marbles as blood tokens to track players damage. The game doesn't come with a method of tracking damage.

How many games bring you the oportunity of aiming your friends' heads with foam pistols while menacing "Drop that or I blow your head off!!!"? Not many. Indeed, only this one!

Every player gets a foam pistol and a hand of cards, which act as bullets. If you play with optional rules, you also get a special power. Each turn a part of the loot is reveal, yet it will only be shared in between the standing players. Each player chooses a card, which will represent if they have loaded their gun or not. Then, someone counts to three and everybody aims their guns at the same time. At this point, you might retreat to avoid any incoming damage. If you decide to stay, bullets are revealed and anyone that gets shot (someone is pointing at him with a "bang" card) is also out of the share. Oh, and three shots during the course of the game and you are dead. Loot is then distributed among the brave players that are not coughing blood and another round begins. I will let you guess who wins the game once all the loot has been distributed. There is also a variant with a hidden cop, though I have found people have a love or hate relationship with it. Nevertheless, it is optional so its just a matter of trying and discovering how you prefer playing.

Ca$h'n Gun$ is the perfect game for Tarantino or gangster films fans, as well as for people that just want to have fun. As you should expect, this game is not deep nor serious; indeed, is the exact opposite. If you think that the foam pistols are cool and that it would be funny to play with them, then you will like this game. On the other side, if your opinion is that playing with foam pistols is an immature and childish behaviour you should not even consider getting close to it.

The mechanisms are simple, but there is an important dose of bluffing and guessing. And if you guess wrong you'll know what your punishment will be: a bullet in between the eyes!

Good party game, but I wouldn't recommend for less than 8 players. Entirely about bluffing and getting the best loot. You have to be willing to risk your health in order to win the game. Players who are very defensive won't have a good time.

Excellent group/party style game. Mark and Hilary told me aboout this at essen and I ran to get my copy as they were going fast. Everyone has a gun and at a count of 3 points it at another at the table. However, every player has a number of cards of which only 3 are bullets, the rest are blanks. each turn before the pointing you choose whether you fire a blank or not. Only live shots take effect. Survivors get an equal share of the loot on the table, this is added to each round. Specialty cards ad to the fun.
I have not had a bad game of this yet, but its best with 5 or 6 players.

RATING: 8
I like the idea, it's really fun to play. There is a lot of play options for many replay value and the game is really inovative. The only drawback so far is that there seems to be really few reasons to aim at somebody, especially at the beginning of the game when you have no doubt on who's who. It also did not happen in our game to have a lot of negociations, but it might depend on the group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A fun party-styled game in the theme of gangsters trying to outwit each another by staying alive to get as much of the cash loot as possible while surviving the hail of bullets or gun bluffing of others.  I liked this much, much better than Bang! and this festive party game should be hoot when played with the right crowd.

The ultimate game of triple-guessing. So he's thinking she's gonna point her gun at me, but she's thinking I'm thinking he's not gonna load his gun this turn and either way I have a grenade. In spite of that, plays fast and includes roaring laugter.

Just loads of fun. :-p
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a game where fun is the only reason you play it. My friends love it for the whole "gangster" feel of it, you know: The guns, the money, some kind of sick negotiation that is most of the times gonna end up in a shooting for the greater amount of money. It's amazing when you have 5-6 people, and it's a mazingly balanced. At the end it is likely that you win/lose for only a couple of bucks or because of a "chicken" counter. 

The rating is obvious, the game is about fun... I like fun, I mean "laughing histerically" fun. But after 2-3 games in a row of this, I find myself wanting for deeper, harder or more strategic games. I almost feel bad to tell my friends I want to play something like Citadels, Coloretto, Bohnanza instead of just playing around over and over again. I am not a "boardgame elitist" but sometimes I like a strategic option even more, when the pace is going up fastly into a chaotic mess...

[Mostly played with: 5-6]

The foam guns in this game are obviously awesome, they make this game so novel and make it a lot easier to get people to play. Not a fan of the artwork, but this is a decent bluffing game with some risk/reward evaluation based on how many people are shooting at you vs. the money available to be taken.

Just plain silly fun. There is a touch of strategy, but there is more to this game than just random gun weilding. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great light game to get a game weekend started.  Game is includes other additions that can make the game more fun than just the base game, such as "Cop" (Think Reservoir Dogs) and Super Powers such as after a person dies you get to use their gun.

The Cop version of the game is not very enjoyable because it is too difficult for the Cop to Win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
You will never see me in a game of this, and it always gives me the willies when I see people playing it.  Pointing a gun (real or not) at someones head is just fundamentally wrong.  I guess all those gun safety lessons from when I was a kid really stuck with me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's a bluffing game where you point fake guns at the other players!

The requirement to split cash evenly, without making change (because you just robbed the bank, so there's no bank to make change with) is what elevates the game. A particular pot might be absolutely worthless if four players stay in but preposterously lucrative if only two are left (or, of course, if only one). Is it important to spend resources to try to get the big split? To spend resources to try to deny the big split? To tank the turn and hope everybody else spends resources for no gain? There's a lot of room for doublethink in a simple, intuitive system.

I guess there's some debate as to whether this can be called a party game but whenever I bring it out it's usually paired w/ other party games and goes over very well.  A light, push-your-luck, bluffing game.  Plays quick.  Highly recommend.

RATING: 6
This is a great party game. There's not much thinking to be done, but plenty of hilarity - pointing foam guns at one another and quoting lines from Dirty Harry is a great way to spend 30 minutes. With a receptive crowd, this game is a sure fire hit.

That having been said, the fun in this game is clearly the novelty factor, as is evidenced by the positive reaction I get when mentioning that the expansion includes knives, shotguns, and ninja stars. I expect that with time, the novelty will wear off, so I'd recommend against trying to get this to the table every week.

As with any game, it comes down to who you pay with. But for me, this is one of my all time favorites and I have had many many laughs playing. For those who want to be, you can be extremely strategic. Theur is an art to this game that you either get or don't get.

[b]Not much game in it, mostly an exercise in bluffing and guessing what the others might do, plus there is a memory aspect (remembering what the others have already played). But it's so much fun to play with the foam guns and trash talk...[/b]

RATING: 7
Fast, fun, and silly. The basic game is a pleasure (I've never tried the advanced game). The guns make it impossible to NOT get into it, and the trash talk flows freely.

I like the limitations imposed by the breakdown of bullet cards, and the surprise factor of not knowing what someone's played if they bow out before cards are revealed.

Some of the powers seem better than others, but I suspect it's largely situational in some cases. A couple of them are always useful (like The Kid), while others might never be relevant.

Wonderful party game that almost anybody will enjoy, with a couple of nice variants in the form of random special abilities and an infiltrated policeman that can add extra replayability if you're burning out on the game.
The physical act of pointing guns at eachother while trashtalking is just pure fun in a box.

A fun and fast party game in the theme of the Reservoir Dogs standoff, with plenty of bluffing and strategising to take down one's opponents.

This one fell a little flat.  One of those that isn't a bad game but just didn't live up to the hype and feels lacking in the end.

RATING: 7
As a filler, this plays very well and quickly, and it's great at parties or for involving people who aren't really games players; however, last time we played people kept asking to play again and I got a bit sick of it by the end. I'd taken it with a bunch of other games in the hope of using it as a gateway. Unfortunately, it was so successful we played it all night and didn't get to any of the others. So, a success with my non-gamer friends, but I got a bit played-out after a while. It's a laugh to play, but I'd rather have more time between plays to give me time to forget the punchline.

Rating only valid for the right crowd, which is essential. (probably no fun & tension at all with the wrong group) 

But if you do play this with the right crowd, this game is a riot. Bring it on!

NL: Je bent een gangster en je komt met de andere gangsters terug naar de schuilplaats om de poet te verdelen. Maar je vangt natuurlijk meer als je die met minder mensen verdeelt, dus bedreig je elkaar tegelijk (met een schuimrubber pistool) in de hoop dat de ander zich terugtrekt. 

Na 3 kogels ben je dood, maar je hebt zelf ook maar 3 kogels om 8 rondes te overleven.

Voor de gevorderde speler zijn er individueel verschillende "superkrachten" die het de effectiviteit van je bedreigin danig kunnen beinvloeden.

Briljant hilarisch blufspel. Fantastisch met de juiste mensen.

RATING: 7
For me, this game perfectly fits the qualities of a fun casual game filled with tons of lighthearted attacking, constant second-guessing, and overall great fun by pointing foam guns at all your friends.  It's fun to play several times in a row, especially as a nice break between more serious games.  This game should most definitely not be taken seriously, but ends up being a blast to play.  It's a little on the expensive side for a rather simplistic game, but it's certainly worth it for the entertainment that it provides.

Hilarious!  Not very PC, with the pointing of guns at people and all, but a good, fun time. :-)  BANG! is more intricate, deep and satisfying, as this is a more slimmed down version of mano-a-mano pistol action.  Nevertheless, it has it's own unique place as an easy, fast and funny game.  I put the cards in card holders to save on tell-tale wear and tear.  It's probably a good idea, since you won't just play one round at a time.  It's also probably not a great game for people who are strangers, as the table talk is a large part of what makes this a fun time.  Super great with the "right" crowd.

RATING: 5.5
Game in a Nutshell: Players play as criminals splitting up a pile of loot from a recent bank heist and they do the best way they know how... with guns... in your face. So you gunna shoot, or what?

Played as: 6 player

Pros:  Probably the most bad-ass feeling game you can imagine playing. You could roll dice in another game to nuke a country off the map and it just feels dorky compared to holding a gun (foam or otherwise) in someone’s face for a small cut of money. Pretty simple premise that isn’t too hard for someone to jump right in and play.

Cons:  Borderline terrible artwork. I mean what’s with that dweeby cartoon kid that seems to be the poster child of the game? The game can be almost uncomfortably tense when you’re left with no time to think, only react.  Sure there’s that bluffing element, but chances are you may not have the time to analyze the bluff and you’re left just have to go from the gut-- and my gut is perhaps too cautious (see: Scared).  Basically, sometimes I just want a little more time to think or game-plan and this game works against that. Not as game-y as I’d like and I don’t want to use the word ‘gimmick’, but it’s a question I ask myself. I really wish the base game accommodated a few more players.

Other: Played just the most basic version of the game. I’ll need to play a bit more (and will happily do so) to really talk intelligently about the game so take everything here as first impressions. One thing that would be interesting (and possibly more appropriate thematically) is if you could decide what card to play (these say if you shoot or not) after guns have been pointed and threats made.

Best Use: Needs a group that will cut loose and embrace their inner thug.

RATING: 7.5
In this game players are gang members attempting to divide up loot in eight rounds; players get more loot by shooting their co-players with orange foam guns to prevent them from getting loot in any given round.  Each player only has three bullets, however, and thus shoots blanks for five rounds (which don't hurt players).  This game is highly interactive, and has a great push-your-luck style of play (as players first secretly decide whether they'll be shooting a "bullet" this round, then everyone simultaneously decides who they'll "shoot", and then each player can back down and not get any money if they're afraid they'll get shot).  The decisions are challenging to make, yet there's no risk of analysis paralsysis, and the gameplay is fun and interactive.  The players do have to be in the right mood, however, as this can easily end up with people ganging up on other players.        

I first played this game in the lobby of a hotel on the night before a friend's wedding.  Six bearded guys sitting around a table all suddenly pointing orange foam guns at each other must have been quite a sight to see for the rest of the guests.  In fact, it was enough of a sight to encourage a pair of drunk women to a) come and hit on the six of us, b) remind the six of us that there were single women outside in the bar, and c) finally declare that we obviously had no lives and should go find some.  [Note: Our first game included only the guns and bullets; the second game included the "super power cards" but nothing else]

Wonderful filler/party game. Players are a bunch of gangsters who've come back to the their hideout to split the proceeds of a heist. Each player has a gun to threaten/cajole the others into making sure they get their fair share. The game is split into 8 rounds. each round a number of banknotes are up for the split - each player loads their gun with either a bullet or blank. On the count of 3 everyone points a gun at someone else. Gangsters can dive under the table to avoid being shot - anyone that is shot takes a wound and is out of the round. Any gangster left standing (ie not shot or cowering) gets to split the money. The player still alive with the most money wins the game. This is a really fun, quick game, that everyone (including non-gamer) will enjoy.

RATING: 5
First play was a pretty fun experience. Quick and light. It's hard for people not to have fun when they're pointing orange foam guns at each other.

I was verbally assaulted for not bringing this game to the shop last week.

Other people seem to like this more than I do, though I do like it. I'm not a big fan of party games in general, but it's a nice filler.

The more I play this, the more I see that it isn't my kind of game.

Traded for A Touch of Evil.

Looks great, a big improvement from KillDog. The game is great fun, played with the right group in the right mood. Unfortunately, that's something that doesn't really exist where I play my games.

Indifferent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played with the right group, this is lots of laughs. However, after multiple plays, it's clear that there really isn't much GAME here. You point guns, you decide whether or not to back out, you reveal cards and you go again. That's it. Over and over again, and the experience never really changes - no matter if you are playing with grandma or your best friends. So for what it is - a fast filler, or something to play when everyone has had a few too many beers - it's decent. But don't come expecting to find a new favorite.

I've introduced this party game to two different groups of non-gamers and they've both loved it. They've even requested I bring it back.

RATING: 7
Feels a bit like glorified rock-paper-scissors for six players. Basically a guessing game but also a way to gang up on the least favorite player at the table. Might not be much fun to be that least favorite player. For some reason the designers felt the need to only half dress the Lotus character. Fortunately a black Sharpie fixed the problem.

Also player elimination for up to 50% of the game or longer if picked on- boo!

My rating is lower only because I see this as an occasional party game - not something to desperately get to play on game night - a good closer perhaps.

It really is good fun - having a foam gun pointed at you (or severl) feels weird! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Not really my thing.  Very random gameplay without the ability to mitigate the actions against you by your fellow players.  Don't want to get shot?  Fine, lie down and don't participate in the remainder of the round.  Lame.

You can be 'one shot' killed in the FIRST ROUND and taken out of the ENTIRE GAME.  Stupid. 

The variable player powers don't add enough to, what I find to be, a negative play experience.  Pass.

Ca$h'n Gun$ is a great filler game that really brings out the laughs.  It has some gut wrenching decisions and a great theme with lots of humor.  The advanced games with special powers and the undercover cop add some nice depth, but are more or less unnecessary.  What makes the game fun is the visceral feelings from pointing guns at each other.

The game is chaotic, and if things happen just so, a player can walk away with a huge amount of money and be very difficult to catch.  This is also not a game to play with people who might get upset when picked on.  In the beginning, when the players are all basically equal, you are going to end up shooting the person who won the last game, or the person who annoys you, or something like that.  This can unbalance the game, but it's a short experience and it shouldn't matter.  As a game its light on strategy, but it's fun and a good filler, with a cool theme and some nice humor.

Very simple yet it's a "laugh out loud" kind of game.  I have only played the vanilla, bare-bones version.  If that version was that much fun, I imagine advanced rules would make it more so.

Update:  I traded it because while it was fun to play, it was of course, super-lite.  And with the limited amount of playtime I have, I'd rather play something that taxes my wits.

Update 2:  Lo and behold, they've reworked the game from scratch.  Now I'm interested in playing it and see how much better it is.

Ca$h 'n Gun$' gimmicky foam guns are the game's primary draw. Basically it is just a bluffing game with the potential for player elimination.

Games with player elimination need to be short, so that eliminated players can get back playing faster, and CnC takes awhile. Even a single disinterested player will suck the life out of the game, making it feel way too long.

Do not attempt the Undercover Cop variant with less than 6 players. Even then it is not very good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A silly party game where on the count of 3 everyone points their guns at an opposing player.  After everyone figures out who is pointing their guns at them another count to 3 happens where people now have the choice to drop their guns and receive a 'coward' token that will be worth -5k at the end of the game, but they can carry on with 0 wounds.  Finally, people who are still in the round reveal the cards they played (click, bang, or bang x3).  This determines who scores the money chips that were put in the middle of the table and who takes wound tokens, three wounds and you are out.

The game is fun and silly, but it just felt really chaotic to me.  I would love to play again to determine if there is any method to the madness, or if this is just a chaotic mess like I originally thought.

Each turn there's a pot of money up for equal distribution, so you're trying to intimidate people into pulling out so they miss out on the money and you get a larger share. If someone is successfully whacked 3 times in the game, they're dead and dead means you can't win. On a turn you pull the gun on someone, but they don't know whether you're just bluffing (playing your click card) or whether you're really whacking them this time and they maybe should pull out. Then suddenly 4 guns are pointing at you. Do you risk staying in, or spend money to bail out and live to fight another day. It starts out being all meta-game on who you want to target, but if you can survive to the end-game without being hit three times ... then it's still about the meta-game on who's going to win. If that's ok, this can be fun.

Fantastic components, easy rules extreme interactivity! :) I'd say this is a mix of BANG! and Mall of Horror, both are on the list of all time favourites, so this one shouldn't be too far off!

It's great because the box bring components to play with alternative rules such as special powers ore infiltrated cop. Top notch really! Great Fun!

- Rules are easy to understand, game is quickly explained and the game is extremely easy to grasp by anyone!

RATING: 8
Un party game divertentissimo, con regole semplici, varianti interessanti (obbligatorie per giocatori più evoluti) e con una - si può chiamare così? - meccanica di gioco vincente. Puntare alla tempia della tua fidanzata un'arma di gommapiuma, mentre altre cinque persone fanno la stessa cosa, dà lo stesso infantile godimento di una partita a guardie e ladri di quando eravamo bambini (ti ricorda lo Stallo Messicano di Harvey Keitel in Reservoir Dogs). La semplicità delle regole non toglie niente alla profondità delle tattiche, al bluff e alla mediazione. Particolarmente azzeccato il metodo di spartizione del bottino.
L'unico difetto è che per un party game, il limite massimo a sei giocatori è davvero una limitazione: inoltre scala male, e il divertimento diminuisce esponenzialmente alla diminuzione dei giocatori (sotto le cinque persone, a mio parere non ha senso giocare).

This is a social/bluff game that plays very much along the lines of "Are you the traitor" or "Werewolf". People point guns at each other to try and get other people to drop out of the booty division. It is fun and simple, and it works on many levels, but I can see this being an issue for some people. The best way to enjoy this game is not to take it too seriously, but just fool around and play your character the best you can. There is some player elimination mechanics, but I have yet to see this happening, and since a whole game is so short, you would probably be playing several rounds so the elimination aspect is probably not a big deal.

Not being a party game fan, I'm not sure how I feel about this one. Although I adore the theme, I'm wary of games where (a) a player can be eliminated, having no further contribution to the game or (b) people have to point foam guns at each other. For some reason, these things bother me.

Really expected to play this more than once in 2008. It's got a violent undertone, so I don't want to play it with the Moms.  It's weird, I've always been told never to point a gun at anyone, ever, so it feels strange to do so - even if the gun is made of foam and is the same colour as a ShamWow.

RATING: 6
Thematic and fun game of simultaneously voting victims with guns at heads, with bluffing as to whether your gun is loaded or not; being shot means you don't get a share of money in that round. Roleplaying personalities will induce the belly laughs and to keep the rounds fresh, as the experience is alittle repetitive. Nicely packaged with variants worth exploring to get more mileage out of the simplistic play(playing the special powers makes some of the standoffs interesting). Fits the rare niche of being ideal for 6 players, with little downtime; my only gripe is the elimination (which is short lived) and the resolution of standoffs and money division is fiddly and hiccups the experience.

A light filler. The game revolves around bluffing and willing to accept a bluff. The foam guns to select the target look good but it is not a whole lot to carry the game.
Played with the special powers - added some interest, but didn't find it changed the game all that much.
The cop variant leads to some deduction, but again not a whole lot to the game.

Most fun as a party game where you want to "shoot" people.

Played with 4 players (basic rules) and somehow it didn't work out too well... Don't know if we were too tired or not drunk enough but it just didn't feel too exciting... Time will tell if the rating goes up. Probably more fun with 6 players and full rules... 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Yeah, I gave it a 9. Beat me in a fight.

This game perfectly accomplishes its purpose. No, there's no deep strategy; that's why you can play it with your non-gamer friends. The best thing about this game is that the rules are simple enough that people [i]get[/i] it. Also, it does player elimination in a good way; you can be eliminated, but only if you specifically choose to take that risk [plus the game's short enough that dying doesn't ruin your night]. The only thing keeping this game from a 10 is that there isn't a super-deep strategy to it, plus it brings out the immaturity in certain non-gamers. In the end, this is a game about knowing people, reading people, shooting people, and laughing while doing it.

I like games with an unique twist and pointing guns at other players can certainly be called as much. A good "social" game which does not really have an intriguing or game-shaping mechanics and I am yet to see players develop a "strategy" out of the mess and raucous. Anyhow, good for what it is and I am sure the advanced game will give it more flavour and edge.

EDIT: Yes, this is 'just' a bluffing game and a simple one for that but by measuring the amount of fun and laughter I experience when playing this game, this tops the ranks of my ratings, so there you go, 7.5 to 9.

RATING: 7.01
I played this the first time at GenCon 07.  I thought it was a lot of fun and would be a good game to play with my non-gamer friends.  Unfortunately, it was not as much fun as I thought it would be.  Do not get me wrong, it was enjoyable, but not a blast.  I think we may need to make a few house rules to enhance the gaming experience.  There should be a period of time perhaps where one can change who he or she is pointing at perhaps, or even when to drop or not.

Downgraded.  The regular game is not that good.  Needs the cop variant.  Problems arise when decided who to aim at.  People can wait too long and react.

 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Downgrade from 8 to 6. It is fun pointing a gun in someone's face, but the game itself isn't that interesting.

For what this game is: a filler for 6 players, it's perfect.

I'll take that back somewhat. If you replace the guns with an El Grande-style wheel, then this game will suck. There's something enthralling about pointing a gun at someone's face, and disconcerting about having one pointed at you. The bulk of my rating are for the guns alone.

I should try the gun mechanic for Lifeboats ...

Juego de gansters muy divertido y breve para aprovechar al máximo momentos de espera o el tiempo cuando no es suficiente para juegos más largos. Los repartos de dinero se convierten en disputas arma en mano. Apunta a quien debas y aprovecha bien tus balas. Mejora con los objetos gansters y el policía infiltrado.

Excellent party game: quick, fun easy to learn.
Not that much strategy, nor ways to win.
Comes with 1 handed weapons, so your other hand is free to hold the beer.

Some fun to be here with the right crowd. Another one of those game that depends on how much the group wants to play. I have enjoyed my plays, but it is very light.

Started playing this again with my game group. Having a fully participating group makes this game much more fun. While not a brain burner, there is some fun to be had here.

After even more plays I have upped my score on this to a 7. I have fun when I play. It's fast, fun and easy to play and continues to entertain after a dozen plays.

Definitely not a game for me. I don't find it funny or interesting. Pointing guns at people and threatening them is not my idea of a good time. Especially when playing with your significant others :-)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Always fun, though I wonder if the appeal of this lies mostly with the orange guns and pointing them at people, not in thoughtful play. Looking at Junta: Viva el Presidente to compete for the go-to nonstandard party game spot with this. Haven't tried the cop variant yet.

Interested in a second copy to expand this beyond six. Wasn't convinced by the Yakuza rules, so not interested in the expansion. Any color guns are fine.

My friends call this 'Pimps and Hoes." 
Not much 'game' here but it is fun to talk trash and wave guns around at each other. 

I now find I'm reluctant to suggest this one because as the "gamer" I quickly become the target for everyone else. And although this happens in many games, in Ca$h 'n Gun$ I can be eliminated, quickly.

Reservoir DOgs the game! How could I not love it. Got to play with the undercover cop variant, got to. Love the cartooniness but still somehow gritty feel--doesn't go overboard into cutseyness by using munchkin drawings--god, how do any of you play with the 2nd ed? I guess by making it less about theme and more about mechanics or something. Have you no shame?! (get it?)

A highly entertaining party game with a great theme. Anyone who's ever seen a gangster movie should have a good time with this one.

Somewhere in the USA there's a parent concerned about the girl gangster character having a low-cut cocktail dress, but otherwise quite happy for the kids to point guns at each other's faces.

RATING: 5
Ca$h 'N Gun$ is a super-casual game with a Reservoir Dogs theme where players have limited bullets to coerce and cajole the other players into relinquishing their share of the money. It's basically all about bluffing with limited card counting. The game's gimmick is the foam guns that you get to point at each other when deciding who to shoot, which makes for great fun when guns are pointed everywhere and multiple people get shot simultaneously as in Reservoir Dogs. There is almost zero strategy to the game and it exists purely for the fun of pointing foam guns at each other. This is a light game, full of laughter, but little else. There is a Gunsfather variant of the game with 9 or 12 players where players are divided into teams of 3, with one godfather and two henchmen. That seems more fun and appears to require more strategy than the standard Cash n guns game. Unfortuntely, this means shelling out more money for the same game as the original only allows for 6 players. The inbuilt variants of the hidden cop and super powers are fun, but are not enough to add to the strategy of the game. Get this is you are looking for fun and filler.

Mindless fun with up to six players pointing guns at each other and bluffing their way to the bigger spoils. There's not much to it, but it's over in about fifteen minutes and usually generates some good natured laughter. Certainly a decent way to start off an evening or while you're waiting for someone to arrive. Not a main course by any means though.

There's not much of a game here, but that's not to say it's not decent party fare.

It's way too random. And there's no way to tell if someone has a Bang or a Click on the table. Meh.

And the powers of the "advanced" game cards are out of whack.

RATING: 8.5
Quickly becoming a favorite of my gamegroup.  The whole bluffing/intimidation mechanic works perfectly.  Yes, the theme might be offputting if you haven't played the game.  I'll admit that I have no desire to ever use a real gun.  I even got my friend who is a minister to play the game(she was very reluctant).  She ended up really liking the game.

RATING: 8
This is just fun. I was really surprised by how INTENSE it is when you are pointing these silly orange foam pistols at each other. All the sudden, they're not silly anymore... sweat is pouring down your face... you're wondering, would Tim really find me threatening? Or is that foam barrel just a bluff to get a nice chunk of loot, because he really wants to place an imaginary hunk a lead into Mike next round. I can see a lot of fun games of this. Also, I'm looking forward to the different variants and the expansion. Team play sounds pretty cool.

Cool party game.  At times I felt as if I was in the middles of that scene from 'Reservoir Dogs'
-many people have said that the 'Cop in the Mafia' variant is too hard to learn, but don't let that hinder you from attempting to learn it; this variant breathes some needed strategy into the base game, and our group doesn't play without it (unless teaching the game to newcomers)

p.s. You can buy some great rubber training guns from karatemart.com at roughly $10 each.  I know that water guns and some airsoft guns are cheaper than that, but these rubber guns give one the sense of realism (they have some heft to them), and sense they're made of strong rubber, they will last the lifetime of the board

RATING: 6
An interesting game that to me falls into a kind of "take-that" style.  The game itself seems like it has some opportunity for good play but in actuality seems to play out in a pretty random fashion.  In a lot of ways, this seems like some sort of cool hybrid of the typical werewolf game.  Like werewolf, your actions early on tend to have no real point.  However, as the game progresses, you have more knowledge to inform your decisions, as well as reasonable objectives -- i.e. whack the leader.  The biggest problem is that if everyone starts to take it seriously, it really seems to lose some of its charm.  So, it can be a pleasant enough pastime with the right group of people (like Werewolf) but ultimately something I have tolerance for in limited quantities.  While I won't likely ever buy it for myself, I certainly would be willing to play from time to time. (6)

Played again with the right group and the rating is for playing with the right group. 

My previous problems: we played with Yakuzas AND a terrible explanation of rules (there was not one team of yakuzas, but they were spread out, the cards badly explained, the mid game break I think didn't happen). This time we started with base game and added stuff later. 

SO: rating just for base game (plus special cards, not tried cop variant). It's a neat light filler with a good theme - when played with relaxed bunch and a good soundtrack (fun lovin' criminals suited us well). Repeated play is recommended as psychology comes out - who usually chickens out, who will take the bullet. Special cards will help you develop your strategy and that's a good thing. 

[i]P.S.: I strongly dislike the second edition. It feels like eurofication of the original - instead of winning being linked to tension and bluffing, it's linked to geekish skills of collecting the right sets. Blah. Also art is bland. [/i]

#69 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

PEW PEW PEW!! You have foam guns in this game that you all raise up in the air and then lower at the same time, pointing at the person you want to shoot. You can only actually play a Bang card to injure someone a few rounds of the game though, the rest of the time you'll be shooting blanks. Nothing like lowering guns to find yourself looking down multiple barrels. This is goofy fun but with some actual game to it.

Fun fun party game. Take werewolf, a little bit of bang, dress it with a Reservoir Dogs theme (lots of guns, gangsters and loot) and you get Cash and Guns.

Players have 8 bullet cards (5 duds, 3 real bullets) and must point their gun at another player each round. If they are pointed at, they can choose to chicken out and take a shame marker (-$5000 at end of game). All others that stay must not be shot to take part in the splitting of the loot.

The game plays fast and is full of laughs, double guessing, a little deal making and all round good fun. There are special cards to spice up the game (must use them!) and even a version with a cop trying to bust the gangsters. It needs to be made in English.

Party, Simultaneous Action Selection, Bluffing. With the right group, this game is hilarious fun, while at the same time capable of causing anxiety - it's disconcerting having guns pointed at you, even though they are just black foam. Lots of laughs, plays fast, and player elimination isn't a problem because every game lasts exactly 8 rounds, unlike BANG.

Finally sold it off as "party" games just don't ever come out in my group.

A játékban rablóbanda osztozkodik a megszerzett csákmányon, méghozzá 8 körben osztják el a megszerzett pénzt. Minden körben egymásra fogjuk a fegyverünket, amivel a legtöbb esetben csak blöffölünk, de ha sok fegyver szegeződik ránk, jobb visszavonulni és kihagyni az adott kör zsákmányszerzését. Azok között, akik nem vonulnak vissza lövések dördülnek és aki állva marad osztozik a kör zsákámány egyenlő arányban. Mindenkinek 5 blöffje, 2 tölténye és egy gyorslövése van. A játékból 3 sebesülés után ki lehet esni, ettől féltem a szabály alapján, de a lejátszott 3 játékban 15 főből összesen 2-en estek ki, tehát odafigyelve nem vészes ez a rész. Természetesen sokat számít a szerencse és a bátorság és a többi emberre gondolataira ráérzés, de a játék fő mozgatója az fegyverszegezési élmény. A játékosok között feljött a vita, hogy vajon mennyit számít a kártyáink tudatos használata, vajon ha teljesen véletlenül választjuk őket mennyiben más a játék. Szerintem van jelentősége a kártyák helyes megválasztásának, de érdekes módon a többieknek sokkal jobban bejött, mint nekem. Nincs vele tulajdonképpen gond, gyorsan le is megy a játék, de én kevés ráhatást érzek a pontos végeredményre egy-egy játékos esetében.

[i]Not as Fun as it Looks[/i]

There is fun to be had here for sure with pointing the guns and predicting your opponents, but the actual game-stuff of splitting loot and dealing with trackable hidden information isn't that fun.

This really seemed like this would have been a fun game.  Silly, fast and light.  I like the concept of the mexican stand-off, but the execution just end up feeling entirely random.  There is just enough game here to justify its existance, but not enough to justify its price.  It really is just a decent idea, that doesn't feel fully realized.  Perhaps if you could move your gun twice a game or something.  

Regardless, if you get pointed at you either back down or call the bluff and get money or get shot.  If you don't get pointed at, you don't get shot.  Which means that the person that gets pointed at the least wins.

There is no real information to determine whether someone is bluffing, so this just makes it more random.  meh.

The art is fun though.

This is one of the best party games I've ever played. Sure, it could have deeper rules, but why? The moment when everyone points the foam pistols at each other is always hilarious... we all crack up every time. The rules are so easy to teach that just about anyone I've taught to play wanted to play another time. Good stuff!

I managed to get two plays in recently and despite my initial reservations this is an excellent party game.  When I first heard of it I have to admit that the "adult" side of me was very unimpressed and I thought that no one would ever want to play it after all it's too damn childish, right?  And it's true, it is childish and utterly silly to point guns at each other, surely we've all moved past such pranks? I mean it can't be that fun... right?  Well it is fun!  Now granted it takes the right group of people, and for that you'll need a group that is willing to let go of some of that adult seriousness.  But overall I have to admit that I (even owning the game) was extremely skeptical about who would participate and how fun it could actually be.   Well that is until I heard the first uproar of laughter as we pointed the guns at each other.  Good fun was had by all, this is  great party bluffing game.

Silly fun, and a psychological game of trying to outthink your opponents.  I think it would get old over time, and I think it can lead toward one person getting targeted quite a bit, but it's a fun lighter game.  I only have played the basic game; some of the advanced elements might help to make the choices more interesting.

Basic Game: You add 5 money tiles to the pool, then everyone loads their gun (cards: 2 Bang!s, 1 Bang Bang Bang! which shoots first, and 5 blanks; played face down). Then, count 1, 2, 3: everyone points their gun at a target. Count 1, 2, 3: people can drop their gun and run away (they take a coward token, worth -$5000 at the end, but no one shoots them). Bang Bang Bang cards resolve, giving a wound to the target and knocking them out of the round. Then Bangs resolve, doing the same thing. It takes 3 wounds to kill someone and knock them out of the rest of the game. Everyone left standing splits the money in the pool, but only if it's possible to split evenly (tiles are in denominations of $5K, $10K, and $20K). 

Option1: Secret Powers. 
You are randomly dealt another card that gives you another ability. For example, you may get the shotgun (can target 2 people, although you may miss), or you may have dragon hide (takes 4 wounds to kill you), etc. 

Option 2: Undercover Agent.
Rles you are dealt at the beginning. There is one policeman undercover, who can only win by calling the police 3 times (in the first 6 rounds) AND surviving till the end (and you can only run on 1 of the last 2 rounds). 

This is a silly game, but it's fun and relatively fast. They did a great job with the foam guns! I like the secret powers, and even the secret roles although it seems difficult for the cop. I doubt I'd buy the game, but I might trade something little for it (it's going to be released in the US with orange foam guns) and I would play it again.

A unique gaming experience that lasts just about the right amount of time for this type of game and is a "blast" to play.  One of the best games for a larger group.  Playing with the cop variant adds just the right amount of spice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The most basic game (without the undercover cop or the special powers) is just a little too simple for my tastes.

As a quick filler for up to 6 people though I think this game is fine if we at least add the special powers for some variance.  Pointing foam guns at each other and yelling threats is a lot of fun and the decisions on who to point at, what to play, and when to bail out can be somewhat interesting but I feel like it needs that little bit of variance to make it really shine.

RATING: 6
This game is best played as an ice-breaker to a party or board game night. The game moves through VERY quick and little strategy (if any depending on the group you play if) is involved. It easily gets the interaction between players started as the outcome of phase 3 (where you decide who to shoot) often stirs up funny remarks. The game does lose its "fun" factor very fast. This game would not be a good game to play after other board games if you're playing multiple board games in one night.

Bought this based on reviews, thinking my family would enjoy it. Unfortunately, they didn't - I couldn't even get them to give it a second try.

Mildly amusing bluffing game where each player chooses a card (either misfire or shoot) and simultaneously point their foam guns at another player. Those that choose not to run will shoot whomever they aimed at; those that remain divide the loot (if possible).

[Repos Production 2005 edition] {Party, mafia; bluffing, secret identity, player elimination; optimal 5-6p} {6.5 basic game, 7.0 advanced rules, 6.5 "cop in the mafia"} Except strategic games, I sometimes look for good party games so that I will have enjoyable time with my friends. I like party games that are thematic and involve loads of fun, plenty player interactions, mild competition, and bluffing. Ca$h'n Gun$ fells under my radar immediately.  I ordered it from German because it's not introduced by any HK shops. I decided to get it after reading the rules and looking at the pictures because it looks interesting and attractive though I struggled a while due to its price.

CG is a hilarious party game with plenty player interaction. It's very thematic and engaging. It has poker feel. It's chaotic and it's not easy to guess who'll be the winner :)

It's very funny to see friends pointing each other. Though players have to point the gun to their friends, it won't hurt the friendship. It's so funny to see players withdraw, gangsters cannot divide the loot, a gangster got killed in just one round, etc. There is a problem of player elimination but it's not a major problem because the game is fast-paced and funny enough that the eliminated player can still have fun (unlike Monopoly :( )

The rules are illustrative and easy to teach, except a summary card is needed for the special cards in advanced rules. It's worthwhile to try both variants. However, the cop variant is most effective when there is a round table. I recommend printing the additional shot-gun card; it's interesting to have a shot-gun in the play.

If I have to complain, it's just a bit expensive for such a simple party game with the foam gun (it'd be better if plastic guns are provided).

A silly stupid fun game in a party environment. The game is a tough sell to both the hard-core eurogamers for the lack of strategy and to your casual non-gamer for the violent theme (you point foam handguns at each other), and therefore it collects a lot of dust on my shelf.

After some initial rocky plays (the players can really make or break this game), this is pretty good.  Got a party game feel with a bit of depth...and you get get to point foam guns at each other!  I prefer it with 4 playters; its easier to force splits and more controlled.

Disappointing game. Heard so much of it and I was eager to play it when I finally acquired a copy. The game is aimless and there is really no reason most of the time for pointing the gun at one player versus another. There are too few bullets to threaten anyone and most people would want to reserve the bullets for the last few rounds because that is where it matters. The game is chaotic too and after a while feels repetitive and boring. 

Certainly a game that needs certain mood and mindset to enjoy.

RATING: 6
A silly party game (in a good sense). But you have to have the right people at the gaming table to get the most out of this one. The games LIVES with trash-talk. If you limit yourself to pointing the foam guns and ducking out or staying in, without adding some kind of acting, this game will probably be quite unsatisfying.
Wasn't really the right game for the people I played it with, so it didn't give us much - which is why I traded it away.

Wow.  I picked this up after seeing people play Ca$h 'n Gun$ Live at BGG.con, and figured this version might be fun.  Is it ever!  Random, tense, fun - and who can resist the foam guns you get to use to point at people with?  Not I, said the guy that gets killed almost every time.  Get this game.  It takes 15 minutes to play and is worth every one of them.

Revised July 2012 from 8 to 8.5.  It's weird to put this in this kind of category given the type of game this is.  But in the end, it's all about fun.  No, this isn't an 8.5 the same way strategy games can be 8+.  But for what it is, it deserves the rating.

This one is fun with the right group. Light and simple and (sadly) its fun to point your gun at your friends hoping to intimidate them in a game. Loads of fun when everyone picks the same target. Unfortunately, it means there can be a reverse king maker (a loser-maker) if you will, in that you can force one person into a losing position with no effort. My friend Mike pointed out that I only gave this a 6.5, yet I have had a riot playing this every time I've played. That's true, but I think that'll really depend on who you are sitting with. That and there just isn't much to this game. I'll continue to play it on occasion with my buddies, but its still not a regular rotation game.

Ca$h 'n Gun$ defines the genre of "spectacle filler."  The game itself is razor thin--anorexic even.  The components are brilliant, and all anybody really wants is an excuse to point foamy guns at each other. Its snappy setup and 10 minute playing time are huge perks.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The fun in this game comes from the trash talking, bluffing, and trying to talk everyone out of pointing at you and pointing at someone else. Although the strategy is very light and people can get ganged up on, this is a very fun game with the right group.

The same group that will like this will like Covert Action. Also, use the guns from here to play Covert Action.

This game rates a 10 just for being hilarious. This is the type of game that takes me all the way back to the beginning of the long gaming trail I've been on for so many years, & what got me interested in playing games in the first place. Pure Fun! We were all sitting around the kitchen table pointing guns at one another, & my son says "Do you realize what this would look like if someone looked in the window right now?" I have to laugh sometimes just thinking about playing this game.

RATING: 8
This game has a funny theme that would appeal to non-gamers.  Usually, that's a warning that it has broken (or at least uninteresting) gameplay.  However, this one actually lives up to it's promise!  For once, I can enjoy the fun theme without getting caught up in the poor game design.

It's a simultaneous-choice bluffing game that is simple, but still has room for strategy and interesting choices.  It can feel a little bit arbitrary at times, since it's easy for the players to gang up on someone, but it's hard to hold that against the game when everyone still enjoys it!  Extra cards for two variants are included -- neither of them replaces the basic game for me, but they are both fun, and the extra variety is nice considering how often everyone wants to play it.

This is one of the few games that I can enjoy with both non-gaming friends and serious gamers.

RATING: 7.5
Letter Grade: A.  Pure, simple, thematic.  

Great filler after a more tense game.  Don't underestimate the fun of pointing an orange foam pistol at someone.  High laugh-per-minute quotient.  Caveats: 1) Would think it would get stale if pulled out at every game night, so I'd hold it in reserve so as not to spoil it. 2) I think the retail price for the game is a little high.  Those misgivings aside I'd rate it at least 1 point higher.  

[05-08-09]: Old Rating: 6.5.  New rating: 7.5.  Above misgivings are aside: I got the game for cheap, and it's really perfect at what it does.  This is likely a final rating for this, though, as it remains a game that would be easily spoiled by regular play.

A party game from a few years back that I finally had a chance to try, but as I had suspected, it wasn't really my cup of tea. It could definitely be an enjoyable romp with the right game group, but depends very much on the people you play it with and what they bring to the table as far as spicing up the experience. The game itself gives you fairly little to work with as you simply try to outguess your opponents with very little actual information to go on.

There are some good things at work here, but I suspect that the majority of this game's popularity rests with the gimmicky foam guns.  That said my opinion on this game has slightly risen over the years, so maybe it's got a bit more to it than just taking delight in engineering a Mexican standoff every turn.

I had been wanting to play this one for a long time, and finally squeezed in a session a few weeks back.

This is a great casual game, and it could instantly be picked up by just about anyone.

The loot grab and character mechanics keep everything fresh, while the social element is pretty funny as people constantly figure out who they are going to gun for next.

I thought it was going to feel aggressive, but the goofy art style and simple gameplay keeps it light, so you could honestly play this with younger players and not feel bad.

Better than expected!

This is a great warmup or cooldown game. After a long game of Descent, it is great to finish off the night /w this short fun game. I think this game was designed for just that purpose.

This game will just get better with 5 and 6 players.

One play, not quite sure what to think of yet. I like the lightness of the game, very quick and pointing the game and chickening out sure is fun. Don't quite like how the loot is divided. It is tough to tell who dies and who lives and there is clearly a lull in between division of loot where bang cards are less likely to be used when the booty is divided the previous round.

Need more plays with different people to find out if I truly like the game.

090812: The key is to play with people you know and enjoy gaming with. This made a huge difference since you can appreciate knowing someone's gaming habits, personalities and quirks.  The basic game does get old quick and with super powers, it is better. The cops and gangsters variant is intriguing and the hidden traitor aspect makes all the players more paranoid but the rules in the rulebook remains a bit vague and unclear. We had played with the cop placing a single call to the cops as opposed to three time. In retrospect, careful reading of the rules, the cop probably has to call three time. This variant has a lot of potential.

Just picked this up as part of a mass order from Adam Spielt (thanks Joe) and got to play it twice yesterday.  I had seen it played before and am happy to say that it is as fun as it looks.  I think it has the fun of werewolf without the 30 minutes of discussion per turn.  It should be a great way to warm up, but even as much as I liked it, I wouldn't want to make a night of it.  A couple games should be good.

This is my favorite party game.  I love the way that it invokes the feeling of "Reservoir Dogs" with such simple rules.  We play this a lot when we have a lot of players or if we don't have whole lot of time.

RATING: 6
Getting past the weird feeling of how wrong it is to point a gun at another human being is the hardest part of the game for me. But, bracketing that odd hippie twitch I get, I'd say this is the most pointless and least gamey box of absolute pure fun I've ever bought. There really is no "game" here. But what emerges from the pretense of playing a game is a blast. For example, the bluffing is less bluff than bluster-- for a bluff to be meaningful I think, there needs to be a modicum of information (from a twitch of a muscle to a melodramitic asertion) that will be analyzed by the gamer. Here, usable information is smothered by both the speed of the game and the raucous lunancy of six guns pointed point blank at the heads' of the players. But the lack of "game" (or "decisions made by a player that affect the outcome") doesn't impinge on the fun. The very act of participating, even without making decisions that matter, is enough. I now, for the first time, understand in a visceral way the appeal of classic "ameritrash." I have always avoided those games thinking that without the tension presented by deeper tactical or strategic choices I'd be horribly bored. (My one enocunter with "Duel of Ages" confirmed this suspicion.) But Cash 'n Guns has taught me that a game that drips and oozes theme from every cardboard pore can really shine as bright as a good brain-melty euro as long as the play time is short enough (as it is here) to sustain the illusion.

Awesome. It's primarily thematically driven, but just holding a gun gets everyone into the spirit of the game. It almost always draws a crowd when I play it on campus, and most of the time the onlookers want to give it a try.

Worth it for the "hidden cop" variant alone.  Simple and cathartic.

RATING: 4
I thought this was going to be great, but it doesn't stay fresh enough not to overstay its welcome.  There's not enough tension in getting shot that you really feel the need to duck out as much as you should.  By the third or fourth time you point your guns, it's clear that this isn't much more than a barely structured adventure in chaos.  Drop out when you have lots of guns pointed at you, stay in otherwise.  I think the game is almost TOO pure, and it misses the human drama that makes the end of Reservoir Dogs so powerful.  I haven't played the advanced variant with the cop yet, which might be more interesting and up the game's replayability.

Cahs & Guns is a great game for what it is- it doesn't overstay its welcome, offers some interesting choices and most importantly it's just loads of fun pointing foam guns at people. I could see myself buying this- certainly wouldn't ever refuse to play.

Love it with the variant with an undercover cop :) the best traitor motive I know. But even the basic game is great, so psychological and fun! However, you shouldn't sit to this with any personal matters. Most of the times I'm killed very quickly because the rest is usually angry with me...

Good commercial upgrade of "Killdog". I liked the new rules (e.g. Shame) and the super-powers, didn't like the "Cop in the Mafia" alternate rules.
The foam guns are so not cool, I just substituted the plastic guns I had bought for "Killdog".

Μόλις κλέψαμε την Εθνική τράπεζα.Ήρθε η ώρα να μοιραστούμε τα λέφτα λοιπόν.Σαν gangster όμως η απληστία είναι μεγάλη.Ποιός θα μείνει ζωντανός ώστε να πάρει μερίδιο και ποιός δεν θα φοβηθεί τις κάνες που τον σημαδεύουν.
Προσοχή στον μυστικό αστυνομικό αναμεσά σας γιατί αν μείνει ζωντανός και φέρει ενυσχήσεις,τότε θα γίνεται όλοι συγκάτικοι στο ίδιο κέλι...
Παιχνίδι για 4-6 παίχτες με αρκετό χαβαλέ.

In an abandoned warehouse, a band of gangsters is splitting their latest haul, but they can't come to an agreement on the split. It's time to let the guns do the talking, and soon everyone is aiming at everyone... All you have to do is stay alive and have the most money at the end of the game!

This game sucks. I don't mind *too* much that the game is nearly strategy free. What I do mind is that playing to win results in awful "gang-up on the leader" scenarios. I guess the game is supposed to be about bluffing, but optimal strategy seems to be to just save all your actual shots for the end. After you have used all your blanks, you assassinate the leader over and over until hopefully *you* are the leader. Not fun.

I don't think I would ever go out of my way to play this, but it's not bad for what it is. In some ways, it's a better toy than game, because the gun gimmick is much more fun than the actual gameplay. Still, it does seem better balanced than most party-type games, and with the right group, it's enjoyable. However, I can't fully endorse any game in which you have as much chance of winning without ever looking at the card you play; if Apples to Apples had foam guns, I'd probably like that a little more as well.

Party bluffing card game with plenty of negotiation thrown in. I've only played second edition so I'm "assuming" this is the same. Everyone plays from a hand of eight cards amounting to five blanks and three bangs. Put down a card, and on the count of three everyone points their foam gun at someone. Are they bluffing? Are you bluffing? Those that don't fold or get shot surive to divy out the loot. Get the most of a set for extra cash. Not bad. Plays quick. Simple yet there is enough going on to hold your interest.

You hold a foam gun in your hand ... you point it at other people tring to either scare them off or wound their character. The way in which money is split really forces you to try to reduce the number of people eligible for the split down as much as possible. It is so much fun. The only thing against it that is really awesome only when players get in the "gangster mood" (quoting movies, acting mean and bad, shouting war cries etc.).

A very fun, fast-paced "Resevoir Dogs" style filler/bluffing/intimidation game. Just the right length (8 rounds) that even if you're eliminated, you're not out of the game long.

Lots of laughs and good fun in a party game with teeth (or is it bullets? :D)

It is a smash hit for my nongamer friends and just a lot of fun to play.

As far as party games go you could do far worse than Ca$h 'n Gun$.  The variable player powers actually adds a little more into the decision making process than simply pointing your weapon at someone.  Not something I'd see myself play very often, but at least it's quick.

A good game. It has some flaws but I really didn't noticed them until I played the new version.

I'll suggest this when I feel like having some dumb fun.  Just don't expect me to be Mr. Pink...

I had alot of fun playing this game and would like to play again using the optional rules.  Played once.

A great party game. The components really make it. I always have a lot of fun playing this game, but I really wish that the art could be a bit better and that the special power cards could be clearer- everyone in the group is always checking the rules to see what their card means, when text would remove the ambiguity.

Great party game! Cash, foam guns and sometimes a bit of role play that my friends bring into this game = best party game!

Meh. Like with BANG!, perhaps I'm just not into this type of game. But I do like Resistance, so maybe it's just the mechanics I'm not fond of? Again, I can see this dropping as the only thing holding it at 6 are the guys in the group who love this.

What's more to say about it than this game has both Cash AND Guns.  Really, really luck dependent though.

what's not to love about pointing an orange foam gun at your best friend while you try to steal his money?

After 2+ Plays: This feels like the players are really just picking a winner.  But hey, it is fun in the process.  This seems like it would make a great drinking and/or staying up until 5 in the morning game.

One of those amazing games that score tops for me but don't really make it to "legendary" (what I consider a 10). A fantastic and fun filler that isnä't just a filler - you can keep on playing for ages.
Players are bankrobbers dividing up the money. Everybody's got a gun to "persuade" someone else to back off the loot. First play a card "shott" or "click" and on one-two-three everybody points his/her gun at someone. If you feel scared, drop out and you don't get any loot. If you feel like playing hard-ball, stay in and everyone turns up their cards. If you're shot you're out, and three shots and you're out of the game.
Of course there are a lot of special powers and stuff to vary it, but it's fantastic.

not played. 

Bought it to play with neighbours and friends as its more of a party game than the slightly more serious ones that I'm into. But since then we've not had a games night and interest has dropped off. So its still shrink wrapped.

Sold

Fun game but defenitely depends on the round if you can really enjoy it. Roleplaying is a must!

RATING: N/A
A bluffing game whose theme is fun (what's better than being a bad guy?), but relies too much on gimmicky foam guns to give it any lasting appeal. So how do you win? Simply hope that nobody points their gun at you so you can grab the biggest chunk of the loot each round. I won't turn it down if it's brought to the table, but all in all it's simply not worth buying. (6 after one play)

RATING: 5
A simple game but too chaotic for my tastes. Not really a game, more like 'socializing'.

RATING: 7
A very fun party game that everyone gets into and enjoys, thought I almost wish it played 1 or 2 more players - without what seems to be a gimmicky expansion. The included special powers (used in a variant) are great as well, though a couple of them could be a little clearer.

Own the Yakuza expansion.

Very light board game.  Gameplay focuses on interaction, and replayability is helped by numerous optional abilities.  Needs a non-serious group.

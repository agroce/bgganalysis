I like this.  The last part of the game starts slowing down due to the approaching end and the limited options, but it's been well-received by both groups of 4 that played it.  

Just played 2-player, and the luck of the draw plays a much bigger factor than with the 4-player game.  Still a very interesting game and I'd play again as 2-player, but I think it works better with all 4.

Ended up trading this one on, as it could be very mean with two players.   Also, it wasn't as exciting as other games to my playgroups, so it didn't get played as much as I would like.

For an abstract, the rating I'm giving this is a good one.  I like the idea of abstracts, but I never take them off the shelf.  But this one sees more table time that others.  I like the flow and the casual conflict between players.  Also, it's good that it can have more than 2 play, but seriously, asking me to get this out when there are 3 or 4 people wanting to play game is a hard ask.

RATING: 7
My game group made the comment that you should replace the GL in the name of this game with an F.  That's because it's what you think / say the whole time as you realize you didn't see another player moving in on your disc, or you count wrong and miss out on an epic move.  Total opportunity for "take that" at every turn.  This game may very well cause a divorce in my house. :)  Four player is a bit more chaotic, but I kind of like that over the strategic standoff in the 2 player version.  I need some more plays to see if it's more enjoyable or just a delayed standoff.

Played at Essen 2016.

Fun and simple abstract. You draw a coin shaped piece from your bag. The pieces show dice like pips on both sides with a sum of seven. Just like dice. You can play either side. You can only place a piece in a straight line from one of your own pieces and it must be exactly as far away as the pips on the already placed piece indicate. There can be no pieces in between. You can stack exactly one piece onto another piece no matter if it is your own or an opponents.

Scoring is by majority of pips in the highlighted room like areas on the board.

Interesting mechanism, quick to play. The clean art style drew me to the game originally. It looks a bit bland at first but makes perfect sense once the board is more crowded.

Unique game, liked it.

I wasn't expecting too much, but was pleasantly surprised - this is a lovely abstract, where you're sort of carving channels along which you can place more of your pieces, and some squares are part of areas with a form of majority + 2nd-majority scoring. There's threats and counters and opportunity for sneaky / clever plays, exploitation of tempo, and it looks like there's just enough uncertainty about the bag draws to keep AP from spiraling out of control.

Abstracts are not a genre I like much but this one was fun.  It's a very clean design that is easy to teach.  Any abstract that fails on that account completely fails on every account for me.  Glux does a good job of restricting your ability to "attack" another player, which is essential for a good "Dudes on a Map" design (and yes, this is a slightly disguised Dudes on a Map game).  I'd play again as long as it was not with people prone to taking a long time on their turn to think over every option.

RATING: 6
Each player has a bag of chips of three kinds, each with d6 opposite-face combos (so there are 1/6, 2/5 and 3/4 chips respectively). On your turn you place a chip, either side up, a number of pips distant from a chip that is already on the board. So if you are placing a 1/6 chip off of a "3" chip you had previously placed, you can place it three spaces away orthogonally, with either the 1 or the 6 side up. Any piece between your originating piece and the destination space blocks the placement, including your own pieces. You can also place over each piece once and only once - then the number and owner of that space is locked. At the end of your turn, you draw your piece for your next turn. The object is to have the most or second most pips in each of the designated areas on the board. Points are only counted at the games' end. A majority in the middle area breaks ties.

The game is definitely a brain-burner in a good way. However, there is lots of blocking and it can be frustrating to not draw the numbers you really want. It is not a game to be taken too seriously, but it can cause some serious AP as you go piece to piece sussing out your best moves. I didn't hate it and I'd definitely play it again, but for that I'm just as fine (even more so) playing Blokus for a quick-playing four-player abstract.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I was pleasantly surprised and will be holding onto this abstract game for the time being. It is quite an interesting and potentially nasty game in blocking opponents from access to the rooms where points are scored at the end of the game based on sum of the pips. Pips determine where you can place a future disc and also add up towards the majority bonus if located in a room on the board. There is a bit of randomness in that you draw your chits from a bag one at a time to use (3/4, 5/2, 1/6). There is often a bit of a decision point on the 6/1 chit on whether to use it as a 6 to help dominate a room or as a 1 for flexibility to move around in the room and potentially score more. You can NEVER jump over another chit on the board although you may play a disc on top of another disc whether it be yours or someone else's and that second disc locks that spot for you.

RATING: 6.5
Good abstract. I like the grid movement and area control based upon the light tokens you pull from your bag. Those 1/6 tokens are very useful once you gain a foot in a particular area. Pretty use of color makes this abstract more visually appealing.

Abstract game where you place tiles with a 1-6, 2-5, or 3-4 on either side.   You can place new tiles orthogonal from a tile exactly that number of spaces away in any direction as long as you do not go off the board.  If you cover your own or an opponents tile, that tile is safe and cannot be covered again.  The game is good for 2 or 4 players.  It does not seem to work for three as it is not balanced.  It is a simple abstract but has depth.  Ap prone players may want to stay away.

RATING: 7.5
First impression: Looks like this will offer a lot of opportunities for clever play.  Very tactical game play and high interaction among players.  

Every play has been enjoyable, but can be a tad bit of a brain burner.  You have to consider where to place your new tile, the new areas this placement will allow you to get to on future turns, how likely your token will be covered up, how does this placement help your area majority, how many of a particular # do you have left.

It is also a fairly confrontational game.  You have to actively watch where your opponents are going and which of your tokens they will be able to cover up.  There's a lot of jockeying for position in the game and trying to keep the upper hand.

(1/17) 7. A deceptively cut throat interesting little abstract with little being a pretty key word in my opinion.  If it were much longer my rating would probably drop, but at its length, it thankfully doesn't outstay its welcome.  Offers plenty of interesting, tough decisions.

(9/17) Drop to 6. Still a great game, but perhaps a bit too dry or abstract so hardish to get on the table.

[b]Length: 5/5[/b]

[b]Strategy: 4/5[/b]

[b]Theme: 4/5[/b]: Though not expressed [i]that[/i] deeply in the game, the theme is unique and kinda cute.

[b]Accessibility: 5/5[/b]

[b]Luck: 4/5[/b]: Luck doesn't actually determine a great amount despite the fact that pieces are pulled randomly from a bag and then determine your possible moves. Since you can flip the tile to the other side if it best suits you, you have a 1/3 chance of getting a tile you need. Occasionally, you may run into situations that screw you over because a tile you needed didn't come out, but you'll generally be fine. Besides, if you get your panties in a twist over pulling an inopportune tile in a game as quick and simple as Glux, there may be some problems you need to address.

[b]Replay value: 3/5[/b] Hate the end this on a down note, but the game's replay value seems somewhat limited. It'd probably be the kind of game that will last a long time on your shelf in the event that you play it only every so often. You can't run this game into the ground like you can stuff like Agricola or Troyes. It needs pacing, or else every game will feel the same despite what happens in the game.

[b]Glux[/b] was part of a trade for Kingsaburg and Kingsburg: To Forge a Realm.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]While I usually don't go out of my way to play/buy abstract games, Glux drew me in because of the area control element. The unique aspect of Glux are the double sided tokens you draw, each side having the pip values from opposite sides of a die (1/6, 2/5 and 3/4). You place a token by counting the value of a token already on the board and placing the new token that number spaces away. There areas of the board [i](which is a giant grid)[/i] which are light; those are the areas you will score based on majority. Majorities are determined by adding the pip values of all the tokens in each lit area. The game revolves around messing with your opponents plans by  covering up your opponent's disc(s) with your own, careful planning is a must. 

Typical of Queen Games, Glux is another well produced (albeit simple components) family game. Games are quick making it easy to play a few games in quick succession. While the rules are simple, there is a lot to think about, especially as the board begins to fill up with tokens. I'm glad I ended up taking a flier on Glux, it offers a quick, family weight area control game that plays well with two.[/i]

RATING: 10
I cannot sing this game's praises enough! Glux definitely falls more into the abstract category like Go or Checkers. And those aren't typically my games because, while I desire a focus on mechanics over theme, I need a sprinkling or some effort in the way of story or narrative. And Glux is pure tactics; while your turn starts randomly (a pull from a bag), your success in the game largely rests on outsmarting your opponents and pre-empting them. Turns are fast and simple, although it can be confusing as to who's turn it is. I love using this as an appetizer to the day's games. It's fast, strategic but not taxing, and fun to play! Such a simple concept but wonderfully executed. Would love to see some modular boards released for some variety.

Excellent game ...very simple rules but as with most abstracts the play gets more challenging the further into play one gets ...very well produced ...although I would have paid extra for resin/ plastic discs instead of cardboard ones which will certainly wear and tear over time especially as rules state one should keep the drawn disc in ones  hands ...oil/ grease / sweat etc will do their utmost to attack the innocent cardboard ...

A few plays in and it seems to be an alright abstract game. I'm not quite as enamored with it as I had hoped, but I also got this for like $15. Don't think there is a whole lot to explore and I'm unsure of whether I like this with more or less players. Haven't tried 4 yet, but I feel that might be a tad much.

The game is fine, but not exactly exciting. I'd rather play Blokus with 4 or any of the Gipf games with 2.

I like every game from Queen Games but I this could be the best one they have now. 

The aesthetic of the board, the colours, the mechanics, the simplicity of the rules, I love everything.

Despite of the simple rules the game has a deepy strategy and every person (experts or not) could enjoy it. 

I've just played for 2 and 4 players (not sure if for 3 players works, looks like is not balance for the positions of the inicial chips).

My family adore it and I think my friends will enjoy it too. 

I'm not sure how this board game couldn't fight for the Spiel Des Jahres, is awesome.

One of the best area control games I've ever played. You're not just trying to control certain areas, you're solving a puzzle of how to get your pieces into those areas, how to block your opponent from being able to move into those areas, how to sneak into an opponent's area without them noticing or being able to do anything about it until it's too late, etc. It feels a little like Blokus in that respect, as you're trying to maneuver around your opponent's spots and sneak in without your opponent realizing what you're doing, but it plays in a different way.

Highly recommend it, don't judge it by it's rather nondescript appearance. It's a shame more people aren't familiar with this game.

A lovely abstract strategy game with a great balance between luck and strategy. Playable even with AP prone players as it forces them to play with the one piece they've drawn. Wish the components were a bit nicer, but that's the only drawback to this surprisingly great abstract.

This is a relatively quick-playing abstract game. I don't really love dry pure abstracts, but this has enough randomness and speed of play to make this kind of fun!

Each player has a bag of tokens with pips on both sides (sum to 7, like a d6). You start with a token on your start space (position varies by player count, basically equidistant from other player start markers). On your turn, draw a token and place it on the board with either side up. It must be placed in an orthogonal line from another of your pieces (n=pips showing on that piece), exactly n spaces away, with an unobstructed path. You are allowed to land on another token, but only if it is in the space alone. The game ends when everyone has played all their tokens, or run out of legal moves. Then, score each of the marked areas: 1st/2nd place, by sum of pips showing, score 4/2 VP (friendly ties). Most VP wins!

Fun game!

tl;dr: run of the mill family friendly abstract

[thing=9674][/thing] and [thing=25669][/thing] have shown that family friendly abstract strategy games can be fun and enjoyable for eurosnoot like me. So I'm always looking for games that fit that same niche.
This game tries to do that, and doesn't fail, but it doesn't stand out either.
It's also mostly tactical, not all that strategic.
It was OK, but nothing special

Initial rating: 6.2/10
BGG scale: 6/10

Really nice interactive area control abstract game.  Nice depth for such a small set of rules.  Attractive play time too.

This game is a bit too abstract and pattern-cognizant for my liking.

Simple and fun area majority game. More fun than it looks.

Really good multi-player abstract. The first few turns are a little slow, but by the end you're scrambling to overtake your opponents' pieces wherever possible, while trying to protect your own.

Because of its simplicity I could see this becoming a modern gateway game.

Quick abstract, gets a bit tedious toward the end.

Sheena doesn't like this abstract game, but I loved it.  Possibly because I won every time we played...

Clever abstract... I just really wish it came in a more compact and/or pretty package.

better than it seems at the beginning. it's simple and it requires some clever tactics. unfortunately, been a Queen game, it requires luck, and I hate luck in abstract games like this. hence 0.2 points less

A lot "thinkier" than you would first imagine.  Knowing when to use the higher value pips as opposed to the lower, where to go and when, when to stack.  More decisions making this a quick fun game!

I really like this game, but the theme is so pasted on it really is embarrassing.  This is an abstract game.

Good game. Abstract. Blocking and screw your buddy as well. Easy to learn. Much replayability. Good thinking game and family game.

You must think about area control and how to project your self into "lights" while making sure your opponent does not out maneuver or block you since you cannot jump over tiles (yours as well as your opponents). Thus the number you play is important to what your objective may be.

A simple, elegant abstract game for 2-4 players. I think 2-players is the sweet spot. Overall, it's an excellent, area-control puzzle. See my more detailed review for pics and additional thoughts.

Would like to own, probably good for non-gaming in-laws. Abstract. Board is different for 2 vs 3 or 4 players.

Really solid game. Easy to learn, takes some time to think of which place to put the token.

Clever abstract game with deep strategic decisions and high player interaction from start to finish. Plays well from 2-4 players. Biggest flaw seems to be imbalance around turn order, BUT... it is very amenable to "house rules" to change the levels of randomness and balance (i.e., having all chips out in the open and never playing the same one more than 2 times in a row; giving a # of players - 1 point for going first, -2 for going 2nd, , etc.)

RANK: 4455

RATING: 6
Rating specifically for Slovenian Tarock. I like the three player version but it's very predictable and samey. The four player version is great, especially the hidden partnerships. My go-to trick taker for four when people know the rules (nobody in the US knows the rules).

I use a Tarocco Piemontese. Shh, don't tell anyone.

I know I've played this more times than I've logged. Interesting trick-taking game with extremely short suits and an extremely long trump suit (the entire major arcana!).

Klasszikus kártyajáték. Elsőre nekem jobban bejött, mint az Ulti, de úgy érzem még rengeteget játszani kellene vele, hogy az árnyalatokat érezzem. Jó benne, hogy változó párok vannak. (Ezt schnapszerben is szeretem...)

Besides Tichu, my favorite traditional partnership card game.

Whereas in Zwanzigerrufer (and Bauernschnapsen) there are many hands where you cannot announce anything, and many hands that are obvious how to play best, in Königrufen you have more options and more difficult decisions.

A big step up from Bauernschnapsen, Zwanzigerrufen is a great Wirtshausgame. After some time it gets repetitive though, then it's time to learn to play Königrufen instead.

Far too many rules for what is in essence a simple card game, as if trying artificially to install some depth into the play.  Inexplicably popular around these parts, since there exist so many better and more elegant card games.

Strohmandeln Tarock was not as fun as advertised.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.33
The fascination of Tarock games lies in the long trump suit and the near-impossibility of drawing trumps (in some games over half the cards in the deck are trumps), together with the in-game sub-goals that can be worth more than making contract.
In North European trick takers, declarer bids a contract then simply has to reach it, the usual strategy being to draw trumps, then play high cards, with a long suit allowing even modest cards to win a trick. Tarock games are much more subtle. Trumping is compulsory, so low cards can be used to draw trumps, but then other players can draw yours!

Hungarian: (4 player)
Tarock games always have sub-goals to provide interest beyond making or defeating contract, but here the scoring is so distorted that the game revolves around the XXI-catch rather than winning the majority of card points.

Slovenian: (3/4 player)
For me, the best of the Tarock games I've experienced as the default 'Klop' contract that results from no-one bidding punishes those with half-decent hands and encourages risk taking. Works well for both 3 and 4, but probably best for 3 as there are no lucky/unlucky partnership calls and radli are not needed to encourage timid bidders. Rating: 9 (3 Player), 8 (4 Player)

Strawman: (2 player)
This plays rather like 2 player Euchre, except that here there are 27 tricks instead of 12. I tend to shorten the deck by removing the 987/234 of side suits and Tarocks IV-IX, leaving 36 cards, score in groups of two, 36 card points to win the hand. It's a deceptively simple game with card counting and good memory essential to coming out ahead. It never hurts to be dealt good cards, especially if you get both The Fool and the XXI, but hand management is a bigger factor overall. Rating: 8

RATING: 8.5
One of the first trad card games to have Trump and I think I prefer this to French Tarot. (edit- yes & by a LARGE margin)

I played Slovenian Tarock and here you have a possible variable partner which I think keeps things more interesting overall though I am still iffy on the forced trump play and having an unknown partner adds a luck element but it is a cool aspect overall and a neccessary contract option (like in Schafkopf).  The counting is unneccessarily cumbersome (counting in groups) but it works. 

I love the bidding options of how there are many different game variations (contracts) all built into the game and winning bidder decides and they are incrementally more difficult, best part of the game. I love how you can call a partner or go alone as well, clearly inspired Schafkopf which adopted this but here there are many more variations or levels here but they also share "Klop" which is a leaster round and this is a great option. I also really like the bonuses and how you can announce then to make them more difficult but also score more (lose more) points, good stuff. 

I need to play this a few more times to finalize a rating as I only got to play once, could be an 8 with right rules (possible tweak) and more play. I definitely wonder if the deck is too slim here and maybe a couple more non-trump cards in each suit would improve it (for me anyway). 

[u]Update[/u] 7 => 8 Whoah yeah, played this a bunch more, excellent game here indeed.  Still not totally sure about the scoring but I love some of things I've already mentioned about the game and further playings confirmed. Looking forward to playing with a different group hopefully just to see how things will differ.  This is likely going to be a fav with Schafkopf and my rating could go up more, at least 8.5 is scoring is deemed to be in line.  

[u]Update[/u] 8 => 8.75 Yeah, this is the game I have been looking for. I was going to design something fairly close to this, it basically has ALL the best aspects of good trick games all in one package. Great tiered betting system, Kontras, bonuses, silent partners, ability to go alone, Klops(leasters), beggar option, great scoring system and a few other nuances like special rules for the Pagat and Mond and more.  

Easily on par and possibly better than some of my favs like Bridge, Spades, Schafkopf and Doppelkopf all of which can trace their roots back to this game of course with Doppelkopf being the closest in play (tons of options in both games) 

I could be tempted to make a few tweaks mostly to scoring (Kontras can get crazy) but the game is great just how it is.  So many trump games have come out over the years after this and MOST (I’ve played pretty much every good one and tons of bad, about 50 at least) are just not as good as this game.   

[u]Update[/u] =>9 Giving it the full 9, Radli and partner game can be disappointing, but overall I love this trick-taker. Partner game you can get picked by bad partner, and other partners can get huge points just by being picked, its very random that way, however card distribution might be better this way, there is a couple extra bidding options (and 1 or two are more viable) and its still fun. Klop penalties are a little high, but then not sure if that is just the website where I play. Trouble is with these things that award big points or penalties is someone can runaway, and its no fun playing the last half of a game when the winning order has already been determined. Talon can be very random, and in Klop the cards being placed from the talon also very random.  Of course the deal can be cruel too, I played 6 games in a row once with all crappy hands, wasn't fun but it is not the norm for sure, the luck does keep my rating from going above 9 anyway. Counting cards is a HUGE help if you can do it, and there are not that many here (but 22 trump can be hard to track vs 14 in Sheep), sadly for me I am not that great at counting.   

[u]Update[/u] Have now played well over 100 games of this, addicting game for sure, and has some depth as its not easy to play well can take many many games to really learn the “tricks” here, punn intended *-). I kind of got used to the Radli, still think doubling is kind of high, but then so are Kontras and counter Kontras etc.  The forced trump play when you don’t have a suit sure takes some getting used to, and it makes playing against a bidder harder as you can’t throw off while you still have trump, but it does work and you adjust (I do think I prefer the conventional way like in Sheepshead, Spades etc, especially when playing partners).  

I wish there was 2 levels of Beggar, there is a game that does this (cant remember which) where you can call all but 1 trick or no tricks where none is a higher bid worth more points. Basically with 22 trump getting a beggar hand in 3 player especially and being able to bid with it and succeed is VERY rare since you need all tricks, I would like to see it come up more often like 1 in 30 games(all but 1 trick) instead of 1 in 60/80(all tricks).  Same goes for the Valats, as rules are written you need ALL tricks and that is just very tough to pull off and rarely ever gets bid. Would love to see a no trump option where you can bid take all but 1 trick OR 0 no trump (take all tricks) which is a higher bid.  

Anyway this is an excellent game for 3 (good for 4 too but less control over your fate) and a huge favourite with Sheepshead and Doppel. If luck was lower this would be my perfect card game, shame, it can be frustrating, something I will attempt to tweak maybe. Go play it here its a great way to learn and play: http://igrajmo.se/

[u]Update[/u] 9 => 8.5 Likely a final update, the luck is just starting to bother me too much, and Radli can exasperate it. Still one of the all time great trick takers imho, but I wish luck were lower, and I hope to tweak it one way or another here or in my own design

A classic trick-taking card game which is extremely popular in my home country (Slovenia). Tournaments are organised regularly and the game is taken very seriously. We've played countless games of Tarock during high school. Best played on three players but much more fun to play with four players.

Slovenian Tarok is an excellent trick-taking game for three or four players. The four-player game is perhaps a bit more interesting, thanks to the variable partnerships. It's my favourite four-player card game.

Hungarian Tarokk is a beautiful game, with some very interesting methods of information delivery and partnership formation. I enjoy the basic version and look forward to trying the Illustrated version, which seems to me to be the pinnacle of Tarot games. However, it does require experienced players to shine.

Cego is a very curious game: first round of bidding is for solo, on the other rounds you bid for games where you switch most of your hand to the widow you haven't seen - you only get to keep one or two cards. That's odd, and it's a really odd game. Worth trying, and while not my favourite Tarot game, I'll probably want to play it for the colour every now and then.

Strohmandel is an excellent game for two players, one of my definite two-player favourites. Players have 15 cards in hand and 12 cards in three piles. Top card of the pile is visible and part of your hand. Simple but fun.

I own several packs: many different Austrian Tarock packs (French suits, 54 cards, very pretty and high usability) and a Cego pack with animal tarocks (French suits, 54 cards).

Enthusiastic. Classic.

This is a game that I've been playing with my family for years, and is probably one of the chief reasons I became such an avid gamer.  It was a rite of passage to learn the Slovenian names for everything, and thus being able to play with my grandfather.  What I prefer about Tarock over other trick taking games is the permanent trump suit and the ample point scoring opportunities.  The fact that almost half the deck, 22 of 54 cards, are trump, really allows you to do more with a bad hand than other trump games.  And being able to call out different scoring sets before the hand adds a lot of tension.

There isn't a whole lot that distinguishes Tarock from other trick taking games, and certainly much of my love for it is because I've been playing with my family for years, but it is quite a good game.  Probably not worth seeking out unless you are a trick taking fanatic, as it is similar to Bridge and others, but I'll always play it with my family.

3-5 player card game. One of the better, more complex traditional card games played in Central Europe. It is Slovenia's most popular card game. Most locals will know the rules, don't be afraid to ask them if you'd like to learn the game, most would be delighted to teach it.

It's a cross between 500 and Beutelschneider. Standard trick taking game, 4 suits of 8 cards, the top 4 cards are scorers. There's a trump suit of 22 cards which override each of the standard suits, the top 2 and the bottom trump are scorers. You must follow suit, otherwise you must trump, *kind* of making each suit 30 cards long. Bidding at the start is up a range of set contracts ... with a partner (call for a king) plus kitty (you have a choice of 2 three card kitties), just a partner, just the kitty, no partner / no kitty, win 1 trick, win no tricks, etc, all worth various point scores. For non-misere contracts, the aim is to win over half the points available BUT a score card only scores its full value if you can match it with 2 non-scorer cards from the tricks you’ve won. 

It took a while to get to grips with how to judge the quality of a hand vis a vis the contracts, but after an hour of seeing how hands played out, we were bidding with some confidence, although not always getting the expected result. Good hand evaluation, card counting and hand figuring - I'd happily play this more.

Fantastic game - there's just the right amount of variety without the rules being too complex. Best features are the low number of hands that are completely useless, the hidden teams, and variety of possible goals.

This comment is for [url=http://www.pagat.com/tarot/koenig.html]Königrufen[/url].

I've already played [thing=4505]French Tarot[/thing] and [thing=101723]Hungarian Tarokk[/thing]. I was hoping that Königrufen would be a good balance of the deductive card play of Tarot (as Königrufen's side suits are eight cards long while Hungarian Tarokk's are only 5) and Hungarian Tarokk's crazy contracts and bonuses.

And Königrufen does mix these two features (deductive card play and crazy tasks), but neither of them are as exciting. The long side suits in French Tarot allow for subtle sacrificial play, which players can't really afford to do in Königrufen, while Hungarian Tarokk has so many trump cards that the goal is to make these crazy tasks (like winning the last trick with the lowest trump or capturing the second highest trump card from your opponents) more possible, and thus more lucrative, than the base game of taking half the card points in tricks.

Rating for Slovenian Tarock 4 player version (I don't bother with 3 player version which has less luck, less options and is therefore less fun for me, though many disagree). 
Rules: [url]http://www.pagat.com/tarot/sltarok.html[/url] 

So what is it and why I think it's that good? Like Bridge it's a trick taking game with bidding that is played with partnerships. Unlike bridge you have permanent trumps (tarocks), hidden partnerships, ability to play alone, ability to play with a bad hand, ability to announce certain "combos". In short: it's a traditional card game with a lot of variety and options, hence the learning curve is a bit steep. With 4 players I also love the level of double guessing and chaos.

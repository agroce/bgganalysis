Solid light wargame.  Low counter density is a big plus.  Rules are intuitive.  I really like the morale system that reminds me of that use in the [family=54][/family] series.  Event cards keep the games fresh.

Don't have enough experience to know what I think about it yet.  Seems simple enough, but there's definitely a lot of good decision making to make for an entertaining game.  

Random events don't seem to ever matter a whole lot, but could potentially be huge, I suppose.  Combat is very simple (the rules overall are easy).

I will say that more playings will most likely increase my rating however.

Milsims 3/2010 with C3i#23.

 Solitaire tryout resulted in Prussian win despite French having the upper hand due to 'Orderly withdrawal' card and sudden death die roll, which provides some balance.

Visually a nice package but can't see this getting too many plays. A good intro game though, although still 6 pages of core rules for such a small game?

C3i Edition.  

There is a lot more to the Napoleon 20 system than I initially expected for a game that only utilizes 20 counters per side.

Winning and losing the game based on the morale chart is an interesting way to determine victory that I will need to play a few more times to fully wrap my head around.

Nice game- unit counter designations very hard to read for middle aged eyes. Color background and small font size the culprit. Fading Glory hopefully will have a bigger font and maybe a setup card.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Tried out the GMT version.  I held a guarded opinion due to the severely low unit counts; I suspect I'd love a "Nap 40" system, even though this might be akin to the old Nap at Waterloo Zucker system. 

But after my two most recent playes, of a half dozen in three years, I have been convinced this has its own niche.  I can play a game in 30-60 minutes, it's almost a no brainer after a rules review, and the tendency for wild swings of fortune due to low unit/combat counts and morale effects, which might bother me in an 8 hour game, are refreshing and amusing here.  

These become a light Nap snack in between heavier games, and it is a delight to pop in for 5 minutes and bang off two turns between chores during the day. 

Jena 20 yields a generous share of Prussian wins due to the tides of fortune; early French EX results cripple the Fr advance, and allow the Prus to better mass to defend.  And of course, the Rout dice can have a huge effect; roll 1s and 2s and they're trivial; get a string of 3+ and that army can be hanging by its fingernails on a cliff in the course of one turn.  But given that's 3-4 hours, it can actually be viewed as realistic -- a kudo to the system.

Just received from VP Games, looking forward to trying it out

EDIT  Have now played first (solo) session. I really enjoyed the game which ended on the 2nd day with a French victory. I found the random events added a degree of uncertainty which I appreciate for solo games. Day turns play very smoothly and the rules for night turns add spice in terms of whether or not your broken troops will return to the fray or not.
As a game working at the operational level I felt it portrayed the movements of large bodies of men very well. 
A nice system that I look forward to playing lots more in the future.

Really nice to have a wargame that fits in an hour of playtime. After 2 plays it feels reasonably replayable. Low counter density increases the "luck factor".
Couple more plays in: Fun!

Played several solo games of this. The low counter density turns the game into one of maneuver so I always felt like I was trying out think myself.

A pretty good game and easy rules but has a rich flavor to it. I would be interested in finding out more about the history to compare the historical vs the actual objectives of the game. Since the game is pretty balanced it just doesnt seem to be historically accurate but Im not sure. I like the game but its expensive for just one scenario.

This copy is from C3i Issue #23.  A very interesting rules read.  Simple.  Could be very fun.  Will try this out solo, and if I enjoy it, I'll try to get my local grog to play a couple games with me.

UPDATE 01/09/10: Tried this game today solo, and it appears to be a nice little gem.  The solo game ended in a draw.  Simple, fast mechanics that provide a modicum of detail.  I sat down, cut the counters, cut the cards, read the rules, and played a complete game from start to finish in about 3.5 hours.  A second play would go much, much faster, I am sure.  Will continue to explore this game.

I'm down. Very simple and needs more chrome, but the rules are slick, and the tension is high. Other than different deployment options, there's but one "scenario", so I imagine I wouldn't play Jena 20 over and over. However, Napoleonic 20 in general offers tons of battles to play. And fog of war is an optional rule that could keep me guessing - even a bit during solo games. 

No artillery units in this one. Wild!!!

RATING: 5
Version C3i.
Une jolie carte mais des pions trop petits.
Certainement l'une des campagnes la plus simple à jouer pour découvrir le système (2 pions de cavalerie uniquement et pas d'artillerie).
Le système tourne bien et est parfaitement stabilisé avec le grand nombre de parties jouées.
Le problème du jeu vient du manque de puissance des Prussiens qui auront bien du mal à faire autre chose que de la figuration s'ils sont amenés à défier les Français sur le champ de bataille. Après plusieurs parties la seule solution valable semble de tirer la carte "retraite en ordre".
Le Français lui ne doit pas avoir peur de venir au contact de ses ennemis.
Un module un peu décevant.

Played once so far, but would definitely play again. Interesting that for such a light, quick game it only comes with a single battle/scenario. But, the event cards will help with replayability. Very good to introduce simple eZoC, maneuver, and morale to gamers. Not sure I'd be interested in the fog of war variant, but other optional rules were fun.

Rating increased from 7.5 to 8.5 to 9 after a few more FTF and solo plays.

This game is so amazing for what it packs into a small package - just the right amount of agonizing decisions, replayable (no two games are the same) and fast (an hour or less). With scenarios and the event cards it seems like you play a different game every time.

I look on this game as a GAME. If I get one ugly roll which ends up losing me the game, well so what? If I had fun playing - I'll just play again!

Highly recommended for grognards to beginners.

The older VPG production values are not the best but this is a sound design. I like the nappy 20 system and this is a decent entry, the Prussians have more units and get a tougher deal from the events and victory conditions. The French have limited units and they take time to arrive on the board. Nappy 20 have a fair amount of luck in them, but luck is not the binary of skill there are plenty of tactical and strategic level decisions that really count. It feels historical enough for me but i do wonder if the CRT is a bit too bloody for the sizes of the units (corps).

A decent experience, for a magazine game. 

The unit designations on the counters are very difficult to read, and I couldn't even see them at first. My only serious problem with the game was the card that forced you to lose a morale point, for no apparent reason. For a game where you spend morale like currency, a card like that is quite deadly!

Overall, we enjoyed our first play, which ran about 90 minutes. We'll play this title again! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A nice compact little battle that swings significantly on the luck of the cards and dice.  It's one of those games that you just have to roll with the punches.  The multiple levels of asymmetry in this one makes for a decent game where a lot of hex and counter dice rollers are just very dry.

I didn't care for this game simply because it is too small.  But, for a small game the rules aren't that simple, which is another strike against it, in my opinion.  I received the game from GMT which was enclosed in a larger game that I had purchased.  Because it was from GMT I gave it a try but I just couldn't get interested in it.  It was probably due to the fact that I wasn't patient enough because I wanted to play the larger game.  The rating that I gave it was from just from one playing.  It's probably a lot better than that rating.

RATING: 7
Good game, with lots of options for the Prussians, who actually can dictate the course of the fighting because they have more units at start. However, it has two problems, the first being that if orderly withdrawal is drawn early on, the French are in trouble. Second, it might be impossible to really replicate the Prussian situation, because even with fog of war, they will know just enough to avoid the historical result. In Zucker and Simmons' Napoleonic wargames this is not the case, and those rules allow for either player to win a crushing victory.

Also, this has too many rules to be an effective introductory wargame, but it is a good step for players used to lighter fare and wanting something more.

Played the C3i version several times. Not sure about the balance of this game (French have been crushed in major Prussian victories in all three battles we've played so far.....which seems to be the exact opposite experience of most other players!) but the system itself shows promise and I'm keen to explore it further. I may invest in another VPG title in the series while waiting for GMT's Fading Glory pack.

There's nothing particularly "Napoleonic" about this that I can see. I don't really know what that might be -- my only experience with the genre is Napoleon's Triumph and Command & Colours: Napoleonics -- but I don't get it from this.

On the positive side: the rules are pretty straight-forward and it is certainly easy to set up and get into playing quickly.

After three plays, the Prussians beat the French each time -- often soundly -- no matter who played which side. Funny that others on the forums think this is unwinnable for the Prussians.

I think I would rather just play Manoeuvre, to be honest.

This game really surprised me, in that it was actually an ok game. I have to admit, before I played this game and after having listened to an interview with Alam Emrich, I was ready for a real stinker, thankfully I guess Alan isn't the designer and the game itself is pretty good. It isn't a masterpiece, but it is simple fun and offers some interesting decisions. There is quite a bit of risk management. So let this be a lesson, don't judge a game till you played it, I was happily proven wrong and look forward to playing more VPG games.

RATING: 7
GMT professional edition in C3i magazine.  It is a bonus game to an already rich content materials.  A good concept to introduce new players into the hobby.

There are only 20 counters on the entire OOB.  Certainly it is a very high level scale on an otherwise operational campaign.  Units are therefore rated almost the same no matter French or Prussian.  I think the designer wants to encourage the players focus on the manouver and outflanking movements of the armies on the board.  The basic system is simple I-go-U-go with many nice little rules on night, rout and retreat after combat (e.g. harzardous retreat across river), cavalry reaction etc.  It is a game that certainly calls for punching the counters and immediate play right out of the plastic bag.

The system is easy to teach in minutes and quick to grasp the basic system, especially in Jean there was no cavalry units for reaction movements. The French was sucked in the game with Jena being lost to the Prussians on turn 2. I rolled many times a dieroll of 1 for the French...not good at all for the French. We found some "typo" to the C3i edition. There was some typo in the C3i edition Player Aid (the Morale Chart where the morale effects for 'Rout' are shown. The chart gives a '-1' effect on Friendly units for an Enemy Rout when in actuality there would be no effect on Friendly units in that case). 

I found that the exclusive rule in the C3i edition regarding the arrival of the Bernadotte's I Corps was with a dieroll of 6 instead of the normal 1 on those coming in with the event card. Randall confirmed me that the VP edition was a dieroll of 1 as usual. Anyway, we had great fun in the game and the system is surely meaty enough but simple to play for any wargamer taste. It looks like a winner and that's why GMT is going to issue them in quad.

Another thing about the C3i rule: the loss of morale due to unit routing. A unit looses 1 morale point if it is routed from combat and has to retreat a number of hexes equal to a dieroll. This "rule" is only stated not in the body of rules but as an example to the rule 9.9.8 Exhaustion. In the Player Aid Morale Chart, it is stated. However, I think it should be stated properly as a rule formally. GMT might want to correct that when they issue the quad game.

On the VASSAL module, the Prussian begin to roll a die on turn 10 to end the game with sudden death.  The die shows a 2 on the turn track.  I check back the C3i edition.  On turn 10, it shows a die of 1 only.  There must be either an error in the C3i edition or someone changes the dieroll on sudden death. It could have had a great impact on the whole game. In one game, my French needed time of an extra turn for come back.  It is the kind of errata that deduct the score on my book and so I only give it a 7.  Otherwise, it would have gone into 8.  

By the way, it is quite amazing with today's technology. VASSAL + Skype and they bring the wargamers all over the world closer. Thanks for all these which help!! Kudos to all the wargamers who spend their time to prepare the VASSAL module and GMT to release them. It is a worldly wargaming now!

A great introductory wargame with plenty of good decision points. This game comes in a small package but packs a lot of fun and depth into it. Play time is relatively short (for a wargame) so it can be played multiple times in a night to explore different strategies. The ruleset has enough depth to make it feel like more than a Euro-style game with a war theme. Highly recommended for wargamers of all sorts.

It offers more ways for Prussian to conterattack to French than that's in Prussian 20.  The French Player should wait for the reinforcements and push forward slowly as the number of Prussian takes the lead at the begining of the game.  Because it's a short turn game (2 night turns), Prussian could give up a obejecive hex and group more crops to attack the French III Corps.

Hex based wargame with limited number of counters. Very simple, yet effective rules with a core mechanic based on managing your morale level. Morale fluctuates based on various factors (routing, breaking, resting, capturing objectives,committing Guards units etc)If you are reduced to zero morale you lose. The game plays in approx 1 hour and is remarkably engaging bearing in mind there are so few units. Could be used as a filler, but is actually much more than that.

Early turns are very quick, because so few pieces are on the board. (3 French, 6 Prussian) The game really gets interesting around turn 6, if both sides are doing well there should be a nice mass of units near Jena.


Rating is after four solo plays, without any optional rules. I think hidden movement in this game could be a lot of fun. But haven't tried it.

I have the GMT/C3I edition.  Components are surprisingly average to flimsy.  Game is OK, although really dicey with so few units.  The first player to roll an extra 6 or an extra 1 will decide things.

I had never played one of these N20 games and thought I had better..., since I pre-ordered "Fading Glory". Very sorry I waited. Once again, VPG has crammed a large amount of game into a very small package.
---------
I've probably played this a dozen times in the last couple of weeks and I would gladly go again right now. No two games have played out the same and yet all the outcomes felt plausible. This game is (for me) as close to a 10 as anything I've played in years. Everything (game length, complexity, component quality, random events vs. control, replayability) seems to be in a very sweet spot that I find immensely appealing. Outstanding!
---------
I've since picked up Danube 20, Austerlitz 20, and Bussaco 20. I think I'm in trouble and VPG is to blame ;-)

Nifty little game that breathes some life into the hex and counter format. Event cards mitigate against perfect plans (a concern with low unit games of this sort), while the morale system boosts the tactical situation with real decision-making oomph. Played both sides back-to-back, and there was enough variation and depth to warrant repeated plays. Makes for an easy decision to P500 Fading Glory.

Nice little "beer and bretzel" wargame.
Options and random events give it a nice replayablity.
Rules could be more clearly set : more friendly on the graphical side - more crossreferencing (e.g. include a note about the possibilty of forced march in the movement rule section).

RATING: 6
A fine addition to the "Napoleonic 20" series of games. Colorful, low-complexity and low counter density, great solitaire play capability, with a surprising number of decisions for the player to make considering such a simple and small scope wargame. Plenty of historical twists due to the nice mechanics and Event Cards feature. Plays in less than an hour from set up to finish. And along with "Waterloo 20" it is very tense with close finishes most of the time.  The outcome of the battle hangs in doubt to the last move, and can turn on the roll of the die, or the selection of an event card, as well as tactical or strategic decision of the player.  Although that may seem like a minus for the game it actually allows for many repeated replays with each game developing along many different courses. The various random events can dictate the course of the battle to the point that the player must be very flexible and willing to change tactics as events change in order to have a chance to succeed.

Bland with an occasional dash of spice or bitters, relatively inoffensive, easy to get into. But I'd probably prefer the old quads to this, although those bloodless CRTs are sad.

Free insert to C3i #23.

Awesome fun in a little package.  The Waterloo 20 system seems like the perfect consim for those looking for a tight, smaller footprint of a game.  Jena 20 was a great way to advertise the other games in the system.

I've used it a few times to introduce wargames to non-wargamers to great success.

[playtester] Joe strikes again.  As simple as Napoleon's Last Battles and it's ilk, but with a different focus.  Setting at corps level means attention is drawn to army-level concerns, such as morale and gross maneuver.  Differential CRT means every strength point counts.  The variability of the random events and rout and rally rolls keeps the game fresh.  More a pastiche than a model of history, it still provides some limited insight with a good amount of tension.  The fog of war rules, while simple, provide the occasional gut check.  All in all, a good package for your money.

After two plays:
Not impressed so far. But it seems that there is something in its simplicity that it's calling me for another try. Or I eventually find joy with this title or I will not have any reason to try another game in the series.

Never played, just read the rule, then sold.
I was expecting something easier and faster. If I have to read a rule book more the 4 pages long, there are a lot of better light wargames out there

This shows you what 30 years of game design has done. The system reminds me of the old SPI Napoleonic quads. However, there is a lot more going on with 20 series. The cards add more replayability for it. My only complaint is the Prussian unit IDs were almost impossible for me to read even with a magnafiying glass. I would have been in favor to put the turn a unit arrived or the set up hex on the counters. It's simple, fun, quick playing and has some depth to it. I have had more enjoyment out of this game. Sometimes I guess less is better.

A light Napoleonic war game that has a surprising amount of hidden depth.  I have the C3i version.  I've only played it solo, and I've enjoyed each game.  The system is quite smart and despite it's low counter density it does give the feel of the historical events.  It's very portable and is a great little travel companion for grognards.

Add me to the list that was initially skeptical about a wargame this small being fun. Before it showed up in C3i magazine I had never heard of Victory Point games or the Napoleon 20 series. I really enjoyed Jena and have pre-ordered Fading Glory.

I like the Nap 20 system, and Jena seems a bit more fun than Waterloo.  Its a great operational level game and seems well balanced.

I also feel like the cards are a little less 'vanilla' than in W-20, so gave this game a slight boost rating.

With replays, the game continues to be good.  The situation is just fluid enough to allow a few lines of possible strategy.

Simple, quick game. Limited replay value, of course, as there's only one scenario, and not many counters. But good enough and quick enough to make it worth considering as a time filler.

Light wargame. Presents the situation remarkably well. There's only room for a limited amount of strategies so re-playability is not so high.

I didn't like this one at all and have heard other say this is one of the weaker entries in this system.  I may play from time to time but I'd like to try another game in the Napoleonic 20 series before I make up my mind.

RATING: N/A
Compared with Falling Sky (the only other COIN I've played) I prefer this slightly due to the more pronounced arc, slightly increased asymmetry and (as far as I can tell) shorter playtime. As seems typical for COIN games, an excellent tug-o-war between the factions with great variability purely due to the order of event cards - another solid entry in the series.

Después de jugar a este y al A Distant Plain, tengo que decir que Cuba Libre es el COIN perfecto para no complicarte mucho la vida. Es un juego duro estratégicamente, pero el tamaño reducido del mapa hace que haya menos AP (que lo hay). Ha sido un acierto hacer una versión reducida de este tipo de juegos. Un MUY buen juego euro/wargame.

It seemed o.k. at first but after playing another COIN game I came to a conclusion: I don't like COIN.
It's not a wargame.  In no universe does a wargame goal consist of opening casinos and making money.  That 4th faction shouldn't even be there.  It's almost insulting.  It's a 3 player game pretending to be a 4-player game.
Even then, I don't like the core mechanics: only 2 players can act on a card.  Depending on what player 1 does decides what player 2 can do.  Why?
Then you do something, which involves adding cubes, removing cubes, or flipping cylinders.  If I have 10 green pieces and you have 9 blue pieces (or what have you), then I control the area.  10 girl scouts selling cookies trumps 9 Navy Seals in the COIN world.  Yeah, I know it represents force more than bodies, but it's just a silly system.
You count cubes for control, spend something that looks like Eurodollars to change "support" in an area, so you can add EuroVPs to your total and everybody plays King of the Hill.  :snore:
Just because the name "GMT" is on a box does not make it a wargame, just like [thing=5][/thing] is not a wargame, despite the Avalon Hill name.  It feels like a Eurogame with a pasted on theme, hiding behind "politics" as a "get out of jail free" card to answer any accusations that it's a Eurogame.
Take the mechanic and paste on any theme you want: Afghanistan, Vietnam, Federation vs. Klingons -- it all works, because the mechanics are just so elegant...

Cuba Libre was my first encounter with the COIN series.  I was surprised how much it resembled a eurogame.  El Grande is in the DNA of what's fundamentally an area control game in which, a lot of the time, you are seeking to put more pieces into areas.  The propaganda cards scattered through the deck that prompt a victory check reminded me of the Wertung cards in Alan Moon's Airlines.  

Admittedly, the factions in El Grande were all vanilla, whereas in Cuba Libre they are strongly differentiated in terms of victory conditions, available actions and resources.  A deck that presents the same options of events or operations as Twilight Struggle in fact drives the game in a very novel way.  It sets a pace of (mostly) doing something every two turns, which can feel tortuously slow as you set up an action on one turn only to find that the situation has changed by your next.

So, Cuba Libre builds on some grand old designs and has some interesting new tricks of its own.  The reason I don't rate it higher is a hoary old problem of multi-player conflict games that it actually seems to make worse - leader bashing.  At various points in the game I played, three of the factions met their victory conditions and were bashed back down before a propaganda card turned up to prompt a victory check.  A player won because their ascendancy coincided with the random appearance of one of those cards.  It feels to me as though leader bashing is more palatable when, despite all having the opportunity to bash, a player wins by crossing a line.

Production quality is good, with a mounted board, wooden bits and a sturdy box.  The artwork is mostly pleasing, except for the box lid which is an ugly mess.  The rules make a difficult time of explaining a pretty straightforward game.

RATING: 8.5
The first game that I played (solo, all four factions, no bots) was a bit flat for me through most of it, but it improved towards the end.

Still, I liked it enough to set up and play again, the second time was a lot more enjoyable, and I feel I'll want to play it again.

It's abstract and mechanics-focused, but in this case and the case of Andean Abyss, that works for me and there's a sort of emergent story. I don't think I liked it quite as well as Andean Abyss, because it is a bit smaller and it's not as ground-breaking, but I think the game does strike the right balance of "similar to Andean Abyss but different enough to keep things interesting". I was skeptical of the factions at first but they actually operate rather distinctly from their rough analogues in Andean Abyss, and the small, tight, map worked very well, much better than I expected.

I'm weird, I suppose, in that this wasn't my intro to COIN: Fire in the Lake was. Relative to that, I think this game features fewer unnecessary complications, and was overall enjoyable. Wish the card text was more clear. Expect for the winner to be decided at the end of the game, not before! And if you're looking for a COIN intro, it's this if you have 3P-4P, and Colonial Twilight if you have 2P.

Smaller map and fewer cubes means this is a quicker playing game than Andean Abyss. Despite having the same mechanics it has enough differences from AA to give a different feel and strategies. You can run out of cash more readily in this game than in AA, which tends to then limit options.

After experiencing a couple of COIN games I have to stay this one gets rated slightly lower due to the more abstracted combat. Fantastic theme and still a good game, just looking for more charts I suppose. 

My only complaint with the coin games I've played is how much importance is placed on the support/opposition track (well no duh). I tend to like combat heavier games and just find myself frustrated with changing the influence in different regions.

A very thematic simulation. I prefer not having to manage my hand and I very much liked the pass option and the asymmetry. 2 negative points that I did not prefer were the chaos of the situation, and the bad player aid. Another observation is that I did not feel like playing a whole new genre of game (COIN) in comparison to other GMT card driven games. It still is about choosing when to act and where to invest your powers on the map.

RATING: 8
Game #2 in the COIN series, Cuba Libre is the easier of the three already published (the other two being Andean Abyss and A Distant Plain): smaller map and relatively more straightforward interaction among the factions.

In Cuba Libre the four faction are Government (COIN faction), Movement 26 July (Castro's insurgents), Directorio (centrist insurgents) and Syndicate (mafia).
Each faction has its particular goal and uses its peculiar actions to pursue it.

Cuba Libre, and games in the COIN series in general, are not proper wargames, they're more akin to El Grande or Dominant Species: area majority games with a high level of interaction a screwage. They're also at the same time less elegant (because they're trying to simulate historical events, so there are all kinds of special cases and faction specific rules) and extremely elegant (because the central engine based on a deck of cards is so clever and simple).

The only cons I have regard playtime (3-4 hours, and Cuba Libre is the lightest and quickest in the series) and the apparent difficulty to win before game end (the factions are so interlocked, and it seems one can achieve its goals only if someone else offer him victory through sub optimal play).

Anyway, I am constantly thinking about the game and wanting to play it...

Initial Impression: Although it may look like a euro, this COIN game is definitely a conflict game. All 4 players have symmetrical abilities and goals in order to win the game. More than the other COINs, the board feels uncomfortably small and each player must nudge the others around for elbow room. Surprisingly, the alliances don't feel so scripted in this game.

Well I'm not a fan of the COIN series but I did enjoy this one for three reasons: simpler, shorter playing time, and a personally favorite topic- Cuban history. If you dislike COIN because of the whack a mole randomness that goes on too long you still give this one a try as all of the negatives are decreased.

Played one 2 player game and very much enjoyed it whilst feeling at that count (controlling 2 factions each) it was not quite reaching the potential that would be fulfilled with 4.  It is a game where  it takes a bit to get around how everything fits together and why you would do an action and for what purpose.  I think its a great "learning" COIN game and could see me enjoying many plays.  Would like to try 2 player with 1 faction each and bots too

I didn't like it at all, but I'm not sure why. I think the game was explained to me badly and I had a bad start, because of that. This made me upset and worsened the experience for me.

I played the government and later in the game I almost completely destroyed 1 player (yellow), which I just could, because he tried to take advantage of me because of my bad start. This was half-tactical, half-diplomatic decision, because I wanted to make clear I don't tolerate too much offense as the government. I could just do that and, well, that's problematic in my book, because I could have even done it, if the player played nicely towards me.

As a consequence I felt the game was too extreme in its asymetry.

Once I was made to skip two turns in a row and had to wait for maybe half an hour to be allowed to do something again. This is just bad design.

This game may be better than I rated it, because the experience in the play group wasn't comfortable.

If starting in COIN series, would recommend this one. Fun game, fairly easy to learn, not so many complexities with small map. Can be played fairly quickly. Have not played it with 4 people, just 2v2 and not huge fan of bots compared to real people. Expect if with 4 people would be much better

Been waiting for a game like this . Cuban Revolution, CDG, interesting mechanics, COIN system, GMT games, Volko Ruhnke, you can't go wrong. Ok, had a play through, and going to play again. Really like the player factions and the cards that are used in the game. the Directorio is an interesting faction to play. Very unique historical interpretation in this game.

Has taken me a while to wrap my head around the mechanics and actions. But with additional play will be able to work out the strategies that this system offers. May reduce to 9 but love the history of this period and looking forward to the next design in the series.

BASED ON LIMITED EXPERIENCE:

Scaled down entry in the COIN series. Smaller map, fewer provinces/city/resources, smaller deck and fewer pieces than Andean Abyss and ADP. Which means it can be played quicker than its siblings.

Like the other games in the series, it is fun and challenging. You feel engaged at all times during player activations since you can easily be the current target. Might be difficult on the Government player, but more experience needed to confirm.

The old wargamer in me hesitates slightly what with some of the seemingly omnipotent offensive play (by which I mean actions which are difficult if not impossible to prevent). I think though that that is due more to my outlook in that I am not adjusting my play to those powerful actions. They exist and so I must learn to mitigate them.

The COIN series are my current multi player option of choice. Recommended.

LATER UPDATE: Further play has me enjoying this more and more. I now think that J26 are the toughest side to play too.

Having moderately enjoyed A Distant Plain, I was curious to give this one a try. Sadly, it badly misses the mark. From a purely game perspective, all the different faction victory conditions are simply too hard to achieve given even minimally competent opposition, leaving everyone flailing, bashing the leader, and nobody even remotely capable of winning. The DR and 26July victory require controlling most of the island in the face of 3 other players who can all fairly easily hose you, which is essentially impossible. Meanwhile the Government actually does have some chance to win quickly if the other players are negligent, but they so rapidly enter a (historical but completely un-fun) death spiral of knee-capped capabilities that if they don't win more or less immediately, they find themselves bored out of their skulls as winning becomes impossible and they simply lack any interesting options. At best they get to decide who else wins. The Cartels have a shot at least - their victory conditions are at least theoretically achievable even without  outrageous luck or incompetent opponents - but with only 4 guerrillas available to garrison their casinos it's still fairly easy for anyone to knock them back.

Despite being so much more compact and apparently more manageable than the other COIN games, it's still borderline unplayable for your first several games. The Government still has their complicated process of building up support which is really hard to understand, the factions all have complex interactions, and most of everyone's operations are going to be relatively futile. So until you get significant experience with the COIN system, it's still just going to take too goddamn long to play and be way too much of a grind - 4-ish hours which, while not terrible by the scale of the appalling length of Andean Abyss (or anything other than the short game of A Distant Plain), is still way too long for what the game is.

And to cap it all off, the rules and cards are written in a perverse linguistic style that makes them almost incomprehensible without close parsing. It's not just that they are overly legalistic or technical; in fact they are often shockingly imprecise, and force you to go with the interpretation that doesn't obviously break the game. They need to put a qualified writer onto these card texts.

From a game perspective, this is really a mess and only fun for about half of the playtime. As a history, all of the COIN games are a bit of a joke, but this one moreso than most: the DR is pretty much created from whole cloth to have an analog to the AUC, the Syndicate likewise is just the Cartels with a coat of paint and not much relation to the actual Cuban business interests, and this whole conflict was really just one of a corrupt and incompetent government toppling more or less of its own accord with Castro providing the shove. All these weird factional interactions just don't bear much resemblance to the actual event, or at least are wildly out of proportion to any real historical relevance. It was just a case of we have this COIN system, let's cram Castro's revolution onto it.

Looks promising, actually. The Deception rule seems like the most brainless ever fog-of-war rule, though. Really? You couldn't come up with anything better than that? Just play the game and accept it for what it is rather than use that hack.

The COIN System is brilliant- the decisions of whether to take an action now, or wait till the next turn, or even whether it's worth sacrificing your own actions so you can prevent anyone else from using the event, make for agonizing and brilliant strategic play. It seems quite balanced, as all 4 factions in every game I have played, have at one point or another, been close to victory. Can't wait to acquire more games in the COIN System.

This is how event driven CDGs should be done. The players decide if they want to try and spin the event that happens in their favour or not. Now you feel like you are in charge and not just watching the events on the telly.

:tobacco: :) :) :what: :D

After a second game (this time with the ideal count of four players), some scattered notes on Cuba Libre, evaluated primarily in the light of Andean Abyss:

* The compact and linear map is a small net minus; it makes the game (as has been noted by others) a very intimate affair with everyone pretty much up in everyone else's grill at all times. This seems to ratchet up the potential for bash-the-leader play, which is less than ideal.

* That said, bashing the leader is not necessarily the best play. Focusing on the long game pays dividends, and I suspect that good COIN series players are those who manipulate the board (to the extent that this is possible) to ensure that some other poor sucker makes the necessary tactical play to drag the leading faction back to the pack.

* Another consequence of the compact map is a more limited scope for a single, devastating coup of a move, which is disappointing as it seems to make the game more dependent on good events for your faction coming up at the right time.

* As inscrutable as the rules for Andean Abyss's Lines of Communication really are, I miss them in this game -- killing the ECs seems like a more obvious (and less difficult) play for the insurgents in Cuba Libre.

* CL's rep as the "short/introductory" COIN game is true but a bit overstated; we played to the fourth prop card in three hours and change, which is decent time, especially with 50% newbies, but not that much quicker than Andean Abyss with three prop cards.

* The Government has an uphill battle in CL, more so (I think) than in Andean Abyss, and I would have been completely hosed but for an event that pushed Aid up to a tiny trickle from nothing. As it was, I was still competitive at the end of the game.

* Diplomacy was a bit stunted this go around, but that was a function of novelty, I reckon. (No one really knew what the deck had to offer, nor did they have much of a sense of when to betray their natural ally. The game does nicely encourage a certain degree of symbiosis between M27 and DR, and likewise between Government and Syndicate.

* Very little actual fighting took place, in large part because I as the Government faction went flat broke in midgame after overspending in an (almost successful) bid to win on the second prop card. Sweeping and assaulting seem to play a stronger role in Andean Abyss -- but, again, this is a first impression.

* Money is very very tight for all factions save the Syndicate -- assuming the Syndicate is able to pursue, unmolested, a produce-consume cycle, which they probably shouldn't be, in an ideal world, but there's always bigger moles to whack. This tightness left me without much to do midgame and ended up hitting M27 arguably even harder, as they ended up being the only faction more than a whisker away from a win at the end.

* The M27 player, in particular, was vexed by their inability to perform Terror actions in well-defended government-controlled spaces with Support; a march into the space activates their guerrillas, a terror op requires an underground guerrilla, and rallies are impossible in spaces with support. He had no idea how to square this circle and I, in retrospect, have no idea either, apart from helpful events turning up. My possession of three well defended cities (6 x 2 + 1 x 2 + 1 x 2) plus the central mountainous province (2 x 2) was enough support for the win if I was able to hold the line. Andean Abyss does more to force the Government to move out of the cities and gain a solid foothold in the boonies.

Net net: a good solid game, one that has a place in my collection thanks to relative brevity and small footprint, but I would not make this the one COIN series game you own if you're only going to have one.

I think I prefer this to Andean Abyss; it's a tough call though.  Andean feels more visceral and a little more open, but I think Cuba Libre's shorter length and smaller map provides more room for negotiation.  I still have some minor worries about the events being too powerful and the game becoming somewhat scripted by them.  If it holds up, it could settle in the mid 8s and maybe go a little higher.

RATING: 8
In regards to COIN, it has its idiosyncrasies and subtleties, it is a quite chaotic (in a Phil Eklund way) and luck prone system, so if you like to control everything, keep away. Similarly, don't bother to play multiplayer if you dislike confrontation and negotiation, and cannot tread the thin line between threatening to kingmake and kingmaking itself. A lot of people dislike this fragility of the system, but the truth of the matter is, if kingmaking happens, you are playing with the wrong players. If people cannot understand that making enemies during negotiations, or even worse, throwing the game if things are not going their way, is a losing strategy, then you need to play with other players that do. Throughout history, countries and factions mostly tried to keep their diplomacy open even during war, and strike when the enemy is weak and unsuspecting. This is exactly what happens in COIN, and it is a praise for the system, not a critique. COIN games are long, but have very limited downtime and extremely engaging play, so they are worth the system admission price. A great series.

In regards to Cuba Libre, it is simply the best introduction to the COIN system, since it is fairly vanilla, short (3h) and has a small footprint, but it is also a very tense and entertaining game. The syndicate appears to have limited ability to disrupt and low fun factor, but even so it is a sly enemy and one that can help the government all the way, but snatch victory at the last moment. The government faction is a hard act to perform, and needs mastery of tempo and negotiations. And DR and M26 are simply a pain in the neck for each other and for the rest of the factions. All in all, a wonderful mess. Lovely game, and well worth it.

+ Well balanced, resource tight and tense
+ Short and fairly easy to digest, as far as COIN goes
+ Each faction plays differently, and has a real flavor to its game
+ The game opens a wonderful continuous space for negotiations, subtle or brutal
+ The components are stellar, and the rules fairly well written

= COIN games have a learning curve of at least 2-3 games, so be prepared
= COIN games have a lot of intricacies in the ruleset, so be prepared to hunt down answers
= COIN games are about controlling chaos, and about negotiation, so be aware

- The bot flowcharts are mediocre, compared to other later COINs. You are mostly going to lose due to bad luck

Following up on GMT Games’ Andean Abyss about insurgency in modern Colombia, the next volume in the COIN Series, Cuba Libre, takes 1 to 4 players into the Cuban Revolution. Castro’s “26 July Movement” must expand from its bases in the Sierra Maestra mountains to fight its way to Havana. Meanwhile, anti-communist student groups, urban guerrillas, and expatriates try to de-stabilize the Batista regime from inside and out, while trying not to pave the way for a new dictatorship under Castro. Batista’s Government must maintain steam to counter the twin insurgency, while managing two benefactors: its fragile US Alliance and its corrupting Syndicate skim. And in the midst of the turmoil, Meyer Lansky and his Syndicate bosses will jockey to keep their Cuban gangster paradise alive. There are four factions in the game, and each one has their own goal.

Supposedly the lighter of the COIN series. CL introduces the COIN feel without the details and length of its siblings. Even so, it is heavy, as it will take several plays to fully understand each faction's actions and the effects of these on gameplay. I like the smaller footprint of CL. 

I'm not entirely sold on the end-game, as there is a lot of bash the (supposed) leader, with the winner likely determined by just one or two final actions at the end. Still, it's a great experience, and one I hope to play more often.

A lighter (?), faster COIN, this one is still very interesting, keeping most of what makes a COIN game, but drastically reduces the amount of cards, pieces and size of the board.

If there were no other games in the COIN series - including its predecessor - Cuba Libre would likely be lauded as a fantastic asymmetrical weuro.  However, as a member of the venerated COIN series and the second outing for Ruhnke & friends, I definitely feel like they hadn't quite wrapped their heads around what they wanted this to become just yet.

On its own, Cuba Libre is the entry-level title in the COIN series (hopefully the upcoming expansion will improve on it) which makes it very appealing to newcomers and teachers who want to get other people roped into it.  The trade-off, however, is that because of its simplification of the system (only in terms of goals and actions; the system itself remains solid), it proves to be the least engaging of all of them.

Even with a vested interest in the history due to my girlfriend's Cuban background, I found CL to be somewhat robotic.  In comparison to Fire in the Lake's constant back-and-forth, mutual back-scratching interaction between players, for example, CL distills the experience into a single-mindedness that didn't quite capture the imagination.

All that said, it's still a great game and definitely informative of the era and its history.  While it's missing some of the more subtle interactions between players, the smaller board (half the size of other COIN games) and limited amount of spaces means players are dropping into controlled chaos right away.  While I feel there are balance issues (seriously, good luck winning as the government in this one) with some of the cards and the overall "moveset" of each faction, the game still plays smoothly and offers players a lot of decisions to make.

I think the only thing that really hampers it is that its design really takes this out of the competitive realm and more of the informative/historical realm.

If you are looking to play a proper COIN game, I'd suggest you look at other titles in the series, even if you are just looking to 'dabble' - I'd say this one is more for completionists and doesn't provide a very good intro to the system (all or nothing is the best way to enjoy this series).

The theme and player dynamics between the 3 (other, than the Syndicate) are interesting. But, that's where the game goes off the rails. The game being mostly luck and driven by random events. Due to the cards and an individual players actions scripting every decision. Coupled with unbelievably no fog of war. The player decisions overall seem forced and contrived. Game map is too small would be better to have had more regions and cities/towns, so there was less clutter. And, to give the players more to do and more room to maneuver. It also seems like the Syndicate player was an after thought to make it 4 players. 7+ open Casino's and 30 resources and they have a win. LOL....this is a wargame? The rules and charts are fiddly are full of small rules and exceptions for various players. It is just too much work to be a game.

A tense game of hostile relations on a tiny map. There's a lot of analysis to take in when determining which faction might be in the lead and needs attention.

My introduction to the COIN franchise and very fun to play.  Perhaps being so new, I don't know the optimal strategies and therefore am not sure on play balance.  I think some factions are more interesting than others, but COIN really requires player interaction and dealmaking, else it would be trying to play Diplomacy without a negotiation phase.  Very thematic game and very tough for all players so it comes down to the wire. It's not a wargame, so rarely will anyone be obliterated and there is some dice luck, but it should balance out.  The map limits possible avenues to proceeds, but does force player interaction and this is the heart of the game - the Mafia, Gobierno and even Castro's 26 Julia all require funding.  I have found it easier to win with the Mafia, provided Batista's troops lay off.  Initially I felt Mafia were a false, shoe-horned in faction, but can be fun with the right player.  The final scoring is always tight and of course seeding the scoring cards relatively evenly through the deck is essential (something to try for Twilight Struggle?).  High marks for the COIN series in general and this one specifically (with factions having cool abilities - I love the air strikes), however I'd like to try one deeper with a larger map with more areas next.

I’ve only played one 2P game of Cuba Libre, though I have played Andean Abyss. I’m torn on the COIN system; part of me appreciates the uniqueness and brilliance of the card play mechanism and interdependencies of the factions while another part of me wonders if players are so interdependent that somebody is going to have lift another player to victory at some point, i.e., kingmake. I’ll gladly play this with 4P someday, but I can’t say I’m motivated to purchase the game to make that happen.

Vol 2 in the COIN (counter-insurgency) series is Castro's insurgency against Batista with two other factions, the Mafia (Syndicate) and student revolutionaries (Directorio).   Asymmetrical starting positions, tactical abilities and win conditions.   Plays from 1-4, solo can be played by Government or Castro where flowcharts control the other factions.  It's a card driven game, but with no hand management as the cards are turned sequentially and only two factions can act on any given card with priorities given at the top of each card.  The first faction's action can place limits on the 2nd faction choices.

RATING: 6
This was my first foray into the COIN series of games.  Definitely some interesting history here, but for first-time players it can be a bit much to wrap your head around the asymmetrical actions, different objectives, and flavour of each faction.  Really, you need to understand all the factions so that you can limit their incursions while maximizing your own.  This would be an interesting game after multiple plays. But to get at that point, you would need to really be into the mechanics and theme, which I'm not totally 100% into.  Regardless of that, there is still lots going on here and the game is well-designed and clearly a lot of love went into it.  I do find the downtime a bit inexcusable.  You can only 7 turns before you get your next turn, and each player needs a good amount of time to figure out their turn. It's difficult to plan when you are waiting as you really need to gauge the board as it looks on your turn as many key things can change. So all in all, an interesting game that keeps me open to the idea of trying a different COIN game at some point. I'm not really motivated to play Cuba Libre again, even though there were things in it that I found intriguing.

Multiplayer sentiments below: (Don't own it so have not played solo)

Overlong for what it is.  Would not play it again. Don't feel compelled to "explore" it any more as there's not much to explore. You're largely at the mercy of the cards. Game controls you more than you control it. Decisions not agonizing."Clever" play will only net you a win if your opponents are asleep or if the random card draws go your way immediately following the clever play.

Who would like this.

1) People who are interested in Cuban Revolution
2) CDG addicts
3) Solo Wargamers

Who would not like this.

1) People who don't like bash the leader games
2) People who don't like somewhat chaotic ebbs and flows.
3) People who don't like slow progress.
4) People who don't like long games.
5) People who don't like wins based on random appearance of victory check cards.

Just played a couple of games of Cuba Libre, first as a solo play against myself then as a solo using their solo system. Very enjoyable system. The asymmetry between the factions is very interesting, in the first game I had all but given up hope for the Syndicate as through out much of the game they had no money and had to pass on many of their turns. What a sleeping monster, the others left him alone fighting against each other and he stocked up, got the money engine going and build a ton of casino to win the game. The others near the end had to gang up to close a whole lot of casinos to reign him in. In the end, the last propaganda card came one or two cards too soon and the Syndicate won. There was quite a bit of push your luck with when the propaganda card came up. Scores where Syndicate -1, Government -2, Anti-Com -3, Fidel -8, looks like the crime cartel got legit!

After playing, I did have an overwhelming feeling that I had just played a very elaborate Euro, there were "card management", "push-your-luck", "area-control", "variable victory conditions", "asymmetry", "cube pushing", "individual player powers", "turn-order importance". It even had a relatively short rule book at 11 pages! Don't get me wrong, I had a great time and will be playing this one again (and again). The game had a good game play narrative, the only thing missing was a turn track (which is what the stack of card represents) so it was difficult to tell what month/year it was to tell a story. The depth is there and there are multiple paths to victory.

The rulebook is SUPER simple! no excuses here! There is a little chrome to remember but quiet manageable. After my game I read the playthroughs in the playbook and that clarified a couple little things I missed. Easy to learn and I dare say easy to teach. The player guides are adequate, not perfect, I though some of the lingo used in the guides to be a little too cryptic, for example: For the propaganda phase, I still prefer the rulebook as it was easier to understand and reasonably short and certainly easy to find. I love the visual on the board, all the wooden bits and super heavy board fantasy flight would be proud off, the only let down I think to really bring this to the mainstream is the crappy (lack of) box inserts, the baggies are standard wargaming fare but still it would've been nice for GMT to breakout of the norm for this very light on counter game.

It was easy to play against one self solo as all the roles were so different. But that did mean it took me awhile before I "got" it... for the Commies I didn't "get" it till it was way too late, but I manage to pick up "a" syndicate strategy (building all the casinos quick smart) and they won despite me forgetting that they get income if they set guerrillas to economic centers! I got income from a few great events and even though I thought the government weak, I manage to hole my self up in the cities with overwhelming force knowing no-one was going to auto victory for a 2nd place. The Directorate was interesting to play and I think I enjoy playing them the most, they need to be subtle then bludgeon the others when the opportunity arises, I think one way for them to win quick is to take over Havana City, which is easier said than done. The commies were the true terrorists in the game and it was important to infiltrate units and use terror and agitation to get opposition and use kidnap to make money, whilst at the same time look out for opportunities to sabotage the others.

In the end I don't think this is a "wargame" (whatever that means), it's more in the nebulous category of Twilight Struggle but still a bloody awesome game.

As for the solo-system version, the verdict is still out, the algorithm is interesting and you can see it was worked into the game not as an afterthought, but it does slow the game down and you're prone to miss things, not sure if its worthwhile when you can just play against yourself (or better with others!). But with practice I guess you can be a lot fluent with the system, so only time will tell. I will keep at it and see.

As a solo game, I have finally come around to where I think this is up there with the better COIN games. I've been spoiled by the later bots, and having only two solo-playable factions is a downer. But the game as a whole is so quick and streamlined, it's makes the whole thing so fun to play. The bots are simple, the rules are shorter, the board has less spaces, all combining to make for a lighter experience.

PROS
-Asymmetric abilities and win conditions are fascinating and incredibly thematic.
-Likewise, the way factions in the game have a somewhat parasitic relationship with one another makes for interesting dynamics.
-Board, components, and cards are gorgeous.
-The COIN action selection system makes for tough decisions.

CONS
-The amount of small rules and the need for flowcharts and tables to guide you through gameplay are a real deterrent to getting further into the game.
-It can be upwards of a five-hour game but fortunes can be overturned with a single event card. And, if you've taken an action before a Propoganda card, there is no way to make one last optimal move. In the end, the game feels too random/luck-driven.

It is a rare thing when a game gives me a "feeling" of anything. In the game I played this evening, as the Batista Government, I suddenly realized that the island, my country's people were shifting against me, I was losing favor to forces I was partially able to contain. 

The dwindling ambiguity of the US government hurt me badly even if I had so many resources and the cities were still mine. The provinces were held tightly by the guerrillas who didn't realize that they had to kill each other off, fighting over the rotting corpse of my legacy... 

I'd like to play again, somewhere soon, I'm sure we did something bad somehow. :)

Some ambiguity in the cards (but mostly in the Non-Player  AI cards kill a bit the game, but not that much. A detailed version of each card text as well as some clarification plus a more thorough explanation of non-players in the rulebook to fill in the the few gaps there are.

Aside from these minor details, it's an excellent game... and 180 min playing time is really the maximum with slow players. We played the full game to the last propaganda card in 2 hours.

I would say from 60-90 mins (for a short game) to 3 hours with slow players. hehe!

The only downsides are that the play book does not explain thoroughly the cards, it's just a copy-paste. I hope they will fix that in a future reprint. And there is the ambiguity with the Non-players when you are missing a player, you often question yourself if what you did is what was intended to be so unclear the instructions are sometimes.

The game is the perfect one to initiate people to the COIN series.

For those who do not know the series, it is a series of games at the medium scale (one country or a few small ones) where you have the feeling of a huge war game but simple rules... Hell! It's simpler than Agricola, Arkham Horror or Mage Knight!

Really fine, tighter rendition of Volko's COIN system.  You have much more constrained space to do your thing in, and with everyone bumping into each other, it makes for more intense, interactive gameplay, well-described at by someone as "a knife fight in a phone booth."  Government has a uniquely tougher time than the predecessor, Andean Abyss, since increasing costs of actions (depressing operational tempo) is pretty much preprogrammed into the timeline.  Great game.

RATING: 10
Upgraded score to ten after multiple plays, both with full player count and with the bots. 

Just an amazing game in so many ways; the rules are elegant, the components are great without being overdone, the asymmetrical nature of the historical conflict ties in with every decision you make, and your strategies will be constantly evolving due to the ever-changing power balance and the dynamic interactions with the other players. 

The game is also the most accessible COIN game and presents the system in a clean, straightforward way. And with the bots it works fine both solo and with 2 or 3 players. 

What's not to love? If you're interested in COIN or asymmetric warfare in general, go out and get it.

Compresses Andean Abyss' glorious but incapacitating migraine into a manageable evening of headache. The interactions between factions aren't as interesting as they are in Andean Abyss, the government and Syndicate feel too closely aligned in a way sides weren't in AA. The small map is much, much more parsable, and it is way easier to work out what the effects of your actions will be. But it can feel like a lot of playtime doesnt cause much change on the map because it is so small. Still, a lot of meaty conflict and area control crammed into this game.

Cancelled my pre-order. As Andean abyss was quite the turn off.

Maybe I should trade AA for this, as the theme at least is far closer to my hart then Colombia, and since the map is smaller, it is said to play quicker (and that is a per-requisite if I want to try another COIN game)

Cuba Libre is a volatile 4-way tug-of-war that just plain ol' works. As a highly asymmetrical CDG that pushes and pulls in all directions -- no role is ever full clear as to *who* it should oppose, despite a few larger trends. The map is incredibly tight such that even conditions of adjacency allow players to roam large parts of the board, quickly, to devastating effect.

A brilliant mashup of differing design tendencies (e.g., area majority, and economic-political-military) make this a real gem of a game.

RATING: 3
Cuba Libre is basically a euro with a rather strong war theme on top.
I'm a wargamer, but if a euro comes in the shape of a wargame i'd be much more eager to play it, than a regular euro.
The strength of the game is:

- the four asymetrical factions, play very differently from each other.
- it's pretty invocative..

as Castro you really wanna get into the cities but you're much safer in the jungle. As the mob you wanna cash in that juicy gambling money & constantly bribe police to secure your holdings, but if the goverment seems too strong you'll assassinate some troops and so on.
One thing i found made no sense was the terror action, you blow up some bombs & suddenly the people love & support you..

The biggest weakness:
- the inherent kingmaker problematic

At every point in the game you see how far everyone is from victory. Meaning if you're doing too well, everyone will turn against you. There won't be a runaway leader and the game will be decided mostly in the last 1-2 rounds. And then it's often just luck at what point in the game the game ends.
Granted there are optional chits that induce a little bit of hidden information, that might lessen that.

[b]First impressions after only solo plays[/b]

To reduce the bot-playtime I found playing a team (Gov+Syn or M26+DR) vs. the remaining two factions unteamed the best variant.

It's hard though. And quite some rules learning involved. All rules make sense and there aren't too many, but you really have to look for the wording ("troops" vs. "cubes" etc.) and pay attention to detail.

The two main competing factions (Government and July 26) seem to be the hardest. The only factions I've seen win so far where Syndicate/Mafia (usually big on resources) and Directorio/Students (they run under the government radar and have the most straight-forward winning conditions).

I think I love it, but really looking forward to multi-player sessions.

[b]Update 10/2014[/b]

After my first 4-player session: this is very solid. Plays more quickly and interesting with real players, of course. Even some negotiation was involved. Great game for a longer evening :)  Keeping it at 8.

RATING: 7.75
Cuba Libre was my introduction to the COIN system, and I have to to say it's a tight-working, card driven war/eurogame system, that offers a lot of tough choices, planning and great game play.

This is a four-player, asymmetrical replay of the key years in the Cuban Revolution, balancing Castro and Batista's roles against the Mob and the Directorio revolutionaries, and managing to keep the agendas balanced, separate and life-like.

Units are abstracted to wooden bits of 3 types, many with an embossed end to indicate if the unit is underground, or working openly.

The basic choice on a turn is: do I want to act on the card, or the next one, because taking an action generally leaves a player ineligible to act on the next card. Because the different card events balance the play order, this makes for a lot of Planning, Watching your opponents' actions, and sometimes requires Quick Reactions.

I found picking up the workflow mechanics of the game to be bit difficult at first, but that the terrific play aids certainly help a lot, and that the designers have done as much as they could to make this an easy journey for players new to the game systems as well as veterans; the rules are really as simple as they can be.

The artwork is lovely and colorful, and the game will play through in one night, even for a noob; it offers a lot of play in that time, and the historical cards seem well-chosen and nicely laid out, on great card stock.

This is a terrific game, and I can certainly see why the series has been well-received.  It takes the abstraction of a Twilight Struggle, boils it down to an island engagement with tight geography, adding only a little unit detail, and two additional players, all to great effect.

I'm starting this at a 7.75, and I expect as the system becomes more natural to me that this may rise more. Volko Ruhnke has improved upon the setting of his Wilderness War and created a different flavor of CDG that should appeal to cross-genre gamers and wargamers alike with his COIN games, and this is a great, tight campaign setting with lots of appeal.

A great "entry-level" COIN system game.  Smaller than some of its bigger brothers, this is a distinct plus when faced with shorter playing time.  Cuba Libre delivers exceptionally well on portraying the asymmetrical warfare in the forests, mountains and cities of Cuba.  This was my first foray into COIN and I really enjoyed this innovative multi-player system.  With its event card-driven mechanics, this game also provides a great historical flavor and a unique window into this interesting conflict.

Really this is exactly the same game as Andean Abyss, just with different cards, a different map and slightly different faction goals. It's just as frustrating as AA, each faction falls just short of a winning position (anyone who crosses the line will be promptly whacked by the others), until someone wins by chance or by having an action immediately before the propaganda card. The Syndicate has the toughest job, needing 30+ resources to win is VERY unlikely unless two propaganda cards come out in quick succession. When announced, I had high hopes for the COIN series, but I already feel I've seen as much as I need, I can't imagine the rest of the series being a substantial improvement.

The games in the COIN series are the most asymeterical that I have ever played. All the factions play so differently it's almost like playing different games altogether.  The theme comes across very well for each player and keeps everybody 100% invested in what's going on.  These games are highly regarded for the solitaire experience that they provide, but I prefer to play them at max player count-the games shines when there is a lot of player interaction. While the rules and mechanics themselves are fairly straightforward, the true challenge is to understand all the complexities for the faction that you are playing-and the strategies are complex. Multiple plays are required to really see all the options and how they interact with each other. 
  Of the one's that I have played, Cuba Libre is the least complex due to it's limited scope(comparatively) and I recommend it as the introductory game for players new to the system. I personally feel somewhat disconnected from the theme and prefer FITL, but that is more my flavor preference than a mark against the game.

RATING: 8
First: this is one of the most engaging and fun multiplayer games I've ever played, and for that I applaud it. I've played it plenty of times, and enjoyed it each time: every game has something new to offer, and they rarely come out the same way because of the narrative offered by the cards.
However, this is also the root of my problems with the game as a game, of which the most egregious is that given a basic level of competence it often feels as if the game is playing the players, rather than the other way round. There's a limit to the amount of variation in strategy except as determined by the cards, without anything like as much player agency even as in a normal CDG. The cards impose so much chaos on the game that it's hard to put plans into practice. Most susceptible to this is the Propaganda cards - the randomness of their location in the deck is a good thing, but it gives a large advantage to whoever has first activation on the card before they turn up. This frequently has a major impact on the result of the game.
One possibility to fix this would be to mark the back of the Prop card, so that it can be seen not just one card in advance but actually two cards in advance (there are always two cards face up, the current one and the next up - this change would let you know when the Prop card was the one after the upcoming one). This might help to mitigate the luck of acting immediately before the Prop card a little bit (I have not tested this).
A second problem is the sense in which the scaling of the rewards in the game seems a bit off. In most multiplayer games, as you gain ground and make progress your position will improve such that you have increased capacity to defend it. In Virgin Queen, for example, the more key spaces you have the more cards you get. In Sword of Rome, taking VP locations rewards you with more reinforcements. In COIN, it's the opposite. The closer you are to your goals, the more you get hammered by the other players without any corresponding increase in your capacity to defend yourself.
The combination of these two factors mean that games are frequently won by a single, decisive and well-timed jump from mid-table obscurity to snatch a win (particularly the case with the 26J and Government, who can turn a position which looks a long way from a win into a victory with a single terror/civic action spree and a quick end to the game before anyone can respond).
The game, then, works best when taken as a kind of tactical rollercoaster ride, trying to hold on through whatever twists and turns the cards throw up, and play the other factions off against each other to further your own cause. In that light, it's brilliant (although 15 games in I'm now not too keen to play much more of it for the foreseeable future).

PbeM suitability: no hidden information and few die rolls makes this very high.

I really liked Andean Abyss. Cuba Libre is more of the same, maintaining the good COIN system and quality components, but in a different setting. The game is smaller than its predecessor (less cards, smaller board), making it a better candidate for learning the COIN system. However I felt the factions were not as balanced as in Andean Abyss. Specially the Government faction, which seem to have a chance at the beginning but in the late game it seems really tough for them. More plays will tell...

After working through the tutorial and playing a solo game (without bots, just playing each turn as I thought best for that faction), I played my first face to face game this afternoon, and am pretty impressed.

I bought it on spec after reading the positive review on BGG (got to stop doing that, it is costing me a fortune) and it feels like a cross between Twilight Struggle (or maybe more, Labyrinth) and Dominant Species, but with a card driven turn sequence engine from the COIN series that gives it a flavour of its own.

I like the asymmetric sides with their different strengths and weaknesses, and their different win conditions. The tight map means every space and every turn counts, and players have to keep an eye on each other and balance developing their own position against pulling the others back.

Some have said this is an 'intro' COIN game, but the length/complexity balance feels just about right for me, so I don't see myself picking up Andean Abyss or A Distant Plain as either the subject's a bit obscure for a Brit, or a little too close to home (given we're still in Afghanistan).

However, I could be tempted by the Vietnam game when it comes out, based on the subject (I'm a child of the 60s/70s), and that I can see that a larger canvas would offer broader scope than Cuba Libre which at times can be very tit-for-tat. (You often need two turns in a row to do something effective, generally move/rally/sweep then something else, which can be a challenge).

Is not even obvious in many cases how to align a faction's abilities to its victory conditions.  Subtle and fun once you get it, but requires a special gaming group to see through.

RATING: 7
The COIN system is a brilliant way of engaging players in the internal political strife of a given country. Most war games concern themselves with boots on the ground and subsequent tactics; the COIN series dares to ask the socio-economic, religious, ideological, and political questions driving the conflict. The nuts and bolts of these designs are equally incredible: an ingenious method of card-assisted play and turn order, menus of asymmetrical actions and goals, and a level of player interdependence rarely seen in games.

Cuba Libre was the series' second installment. A smaller map, EZs instead of LoCs, and smaller deck make Cuba Libre an ideal entry point (though I still prefer Andean Abyss). Factional actions and goals are most similar to AA but there are enough nuances here to make it a unique experience all its own. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Cuba Libre is not as annoying as I feared but not as good as I hoped for. The cardplay mechanism of COIN is unique and engaging. Do I play the event or even only a minor action or do I wait for the next better card? Will the next card be the decisive propaganda card leaving me without a chance to act? The factions each play differently. The government has lots of resources in the beginning but will be forced into the defense. The left-wing guerilla movement builds up forces slowly and has to shift political support. The Directorio doesn't engage in the support game, going for control of areas instead while the syndicate wants to use the turmoil to build casinos and make a profit.

The good part is that any faction can reach its goal without destroying another factions chances. Even the guerillas and the government who both fight for support can both reach their goal as there's enough support for both. It's important to form a strategy and to close deals with other factions while not becoming the target for others. This is where Cuba Libre suffers from the same weakness as many other multiplayer conflict games. The board is so open that there's no real way to protect against attacks in various forms longer than an action. Getting the timing right to have the decisive last turn and reach the goal just when the propaganda card comes up is the way to victory. Otherwise, bash-the-leader is the name of the game with the potential for an unwanted kingmaker decision at the end.

The card play and diversity of factions are enjoyable enough to let me come back to this game even though not all factions promise to be fun.

Asymmetric area majority-style game... with partially card-based action drafting... and an operation-level war theme... sort of? Our first game took over six hours with rules explanation, and even if you could shave off three, it's still a bit much for what came down to a four-way bash-the-current-leader-until-arbitrary-end-point exercise where progress was constantly being undone. Each of us could, at some point, have won if an end-of-era card had turned up. We played one thing wrong/differently: we didn't have the next event card showing. On the one hand, a card preview would have made the game seem less chaotic and at least partially addressed the issue of passing 2-4 turns in a row in the betrayed hope of getting to do more than a limited action. On the other hand, it would easily have added two more hours and made the second-to-last turn a nightmare of going through every possible permutation of player actions to lay out the tree of kingmaking possibilities.

My 5 cents.
Components: High Level

Graphics: Clear, good looking, a little to abstract.

Rules: As with all new concepts, you have a lot of new  
rules, not seen anywere before, which is a bit tougher tha normal. 

Play aids: Excellent, once you have read the rules, you only need the play aids for playing the game, no further looking for the game details in the rule. They help a lot.

Conclusion: I want to like the System. I played Andean Abyss twice and get no feeling of the situation portrayed and thought it was the lack of knowledge about the situation and played Cuba libre, a setting I know much better.  The same. So you get a good working mecanism with very good component, that is near bloodless, no feeling for the time portrayed

Well, it has Che in it, hasn't it?  Hmm...finally the COIN series hooks me (as well as Fire in the Lake in the next installment).

Physical components of the game are the usual high quality from GMT, to a standard that one would say that the components as contained in deluxe edition. Sturdy box, thick for usage in a long time to come and colorful cubes representing forces of the four factions. 4 player aids summarizes all the factions' available actions (COIN operations and special activities and how to perform them), the victory conditions. They facilitates the game a lot easier as the players can look at a glance what the players can do and what they cannot. There are also two identical player aids for solitaire AI routines in flowcharts. Another player aid summarizes dieroll results, randomizing the determination of spaces on the map for the event or AI decisions to call for. The mapboard is mounted, something you don't usually see nowadays for wargame.

The rulebook is a very nice colorful presentation. It's absorbingly detailed but flows with the go on the sequence of play, though on some occasions some terms and concepts might not have been explained well enough. But they are easily overcome as the rules are not that long, with standard magazine game rules of 16 pages only. The index at the back of the rulebook certainly helps. A set-up table is also included at the last page for quick set-up and play. A very big plus is that there is a playbook inside the game, giving you further insights into the game with tutorial gameplay in conversational s(AH) style, the rise of revolution in Cuba and why it succeeds in an article, design notes and background to the card events. As rare as gaming revolution that not many games have done before, these additional materials adds to the package much more value. Cuba Libre is not a difficult game at all to learn.

Historicity is very high, though doubtful to the extent of authenticity as a game, as each faction plays to its unique abilities and different paths to victory according to the historical context. The Syndicate are gangsters operating casinos on the island, looking for opening as many casinos and as much money (resources) as possible. They are short on men and so their cash can be taken away by Government skimming and rebels' attacks. They look vulnerable like bystanders but all that matter to them is business. The Government is always busy fighting and controlling the growth of the rebel forces and there are two factions, Directorio and July 26 on the opposite side. US support to the Government is gone very soon in the beginning of the game and so the Government has to turn to the Syndicate for resources and funding. It has to garner support from the population but the event cards at times topple the Bastista government. The government has manpower more than any other but there is a whole lot of pressing issues on the Government. The Directorio is interested in competing with the Government by expanding the control over the population on the one hand and with the July 26 by expanding its bases into different spaces and regions. Directorio has to strike a fine balance between the two factions by tactful manipulations, subversion (adding resources and neutralize the population support level) and ruthless assassinations (eliminate other units without the need of dieroll). July 26 has almost the exact same operations and special abilities of the Directorio, except that its manner is more restraint with no assassination but kidnap to take money from either Directorio (closing the casino) or Government (the Government has to pay for civilian hostage, right?). The amount of money taken from kidnap could be quite random from time to time with result of a dieroll. July 26 starts from the southern part of the Cuba island and has to, step by step, infiltrate north and expand its influence. It takes time to grow strong enough and to reach Havana, the capital in the northern part of the island, and hence it has to survive the game long enough by the test of the propaganda cards (four in the deck).

Playability level is extremely high. Not only that you can play different faction each time but also the one-player solitaire version. It almost guarantee you a lifetime choices to make and enjoyment to indulge in. The game looks like a Eurogame on the surface with the cubes moving on and off the board like worker-tile placement game. There are some dice rolling to resolve conflicts but nothing major. Players have to focus on their general strategy on the board while reacting to the changing circumstances and happenings out of the events. The sequence of the players taking turn is determined by the random draw of the event cards, knowing it how does it go one turn in advance. To the more serious wargamer in the traditional sense, it is not a military game but a light, fun "political" game that can be completed in three to four hours. Many times I saw the Syndicate won and July 26 the harder side to win - none that I saw. This seemingly unbalance in the factions likelihood to win and the fact that the game can be heavily influenced by the sequence of the card play are two points to deduct from my rating.  No matter what, Cuba Libre will give you a broad-brush picture of what actually happened more than 50 years ago.

Definitely the go-to for beginner COIN.  The two insurgent factions play well and create a headache for the Govt player.  The Govt player watches as their capabilities diminish and their actions become more desperate.  The only downside I have is the Syndicate.  They aren't the most interesting faction, and so often are relegated to flowchart, which makes them even less interesting.  This one COIN game relies on table-talk and diplomacy more than the others with the syndicate player in use.

As the great LCD Soundsystem once kinda sang; 

"Cuba Libre, I Love You
But you're bringing me down

Like a death of the heart
Jesus, where do I start?

But you're still the one game
Where I'd happily drown"

I love this game. It is my favourite coin game and the only one I have played. I do have Fire in the Lake but have yet to convince myself I have the time to set it all up and learn the differences from Cuba Libre and have a go.

Cuba Libre for me is the right length of coin game and I know this without playing any of the others as I don't think I could take anything more. Saying that I will be umming and ahhing over getting pendragon when it comes out. That does look good.

This game is excellent, thematic, difficult, easy ... it's everything at once. I love the theme and my initial impression that it's hard to move about and influence things was wrong. I just didn't realise the depth of the game, the seemingly minor ways in which factions can impede each other. It can be quick, it can be long, every game is it's own thing, its own history in a parallel universe. It's a tesseract of a euro war game. Sometimes its frustrating but I always will come back to it.

Play it now whilst there is not a Starbucks in sight.

Keeper. Fantastic game.

UPDATE

Great game covering a really interesting piece of history in an area of the world I love. Visiting Cuba quite a few years ago was a wonderful experience.

After playing Fire In The Lake and Liberty Or Death quite a few times is was joyous (well it made me smile) to play on such a small board with all the limitations that it brings. Decisions were much easier as your focus was drawn to what you should be doing just by the fact there are only 10 spaces on the board. That also means a lot less adding up everytime the political support of control changed in the game. 

The play was a breeze and extremely enjoyable, coming back to it after the larger more complicated coin games was definitely a good move and it gave me a new perspective on possible strategies and tactics in the game. 

If you like coin games and haven't tried Cuba Libre yet, jump on the new printing you won't regret it ... and if you are too cult of the new for that jump on the new Roman coin game coming out, Falling Sky, this has the same sized board as Cuba Libre but I believe it is slightly more complicated in terms of play and individual player boards have been included to move the piece holding spots off of the main board to accommodate a larger map.

... and in another completely unrelated link, here is a music recommendation to listen to whilst playing Cube Libra, "Afrocubism" on World Circuit Records. A great album made by a mixture of Cuban and Malian musicians ... absolutely brilliant. Mojito recommended whilst listening/playing!

RATING: 9
(3/17) 8. A brilliant war game with the depth, weight and card driven action reminiscent of Twilight Struggle...but maybe done in a more interesting way?  I don't know. I haven't played either enough to make that call, but I really do love the completely asymmetrical factions offered by this game with wildly differing abilities and win conditions.  I also think I like the heart of this game, the cards and the way they drive the game forward, more than I like it in TS, though part of me feels that's mainly due to this game supporting more than just 2 players, which I prefer in games in general.  This is a rating I can see definitely rising with more plays.

(10/17) Raise to 9.  I'm in love with deeply strategic and deeply thematic historical games.  My #7 game of all time.

I like this game but I'll let it go. If I am going to play a COIN game, it will be the astonishingly good Fire in the Lake (or the coming Falling Sky)? The Cuban revolution with mafiosi and the Directiv etc is great and the game elegant but given constrained resources (time), it's not going to see much play.

RATING: 9
Edit: I have really grown to enjoy this one. Against my expectations, it really seems to get the 'feel' of the subject. It has me wishing that I had a regular 4 person group to play this.

Edit: Still not sure I buy some of the elements here (in particular, selecting a couple of factions to be represented out of a stew of factions in Cuba at this time), but I will say after two solitaire games played out, I have really enjoyed the game. I'd like to get a 4 player game, but that's not happening anytime soon. 26th July seems kind of tough to play, but I am in no way a great player of this system. Directorio and Syndicate seemed the easiest to play in my limited time with the game so far.

Just recently got this to refresh myself on the system for Fire in the Lake. (I have played Andean Abyss once, I think, but don't own it) Whatever one may think of the game system, I have to commend GMT for the physical quality of these games, from the boards, to the player aids, to the playbooks to the various playing pieces. Having said that, WAY too much errata, especially in the playbook. Not such a big deal, but really could have used much better proofreading.

I have conflicting thoughts on the games themselves (have not played A Distant Plain at all)...sometimes it seems like the designs shoehorn 4 factions because it fits the system (that really strikes me in this one), and it can seem like the entire game is just bash the leader. (This bash the leader aspect seems so annoying that I'd be interested in seeing this game as a two player, two faction, game, with the other factions being abstracted into the card deck) Definitely some interesting mechanics, just not sure how much I like the system.

RATING: 8
Only one play (2 players, I was Castro, opponent was Government and we used automated rules for other 2) and first play in the COIN series. Found myself hating and loving this game in equal measure while playing. The idea of an even slightly larger map is beyond me but I'm looking forward to future plays and getting to understand the mechanisms and game arc a bit better. I was honestly just so lost in the soup of all of the elements working around me and can't imagine understanding the engine enough to make optimal choices until maybe play 15-20. That said, I was having fun more or less the entire time. There seemed to be too many rules exceptions in terms of how the different factions interact with the cards, which felt frustrating as well.

Basically, as someone who has historically spent a lot of time playing efficiency-oriented Euros, heavy or otherwise, it was a very different gaming experience to wrap my head around, though one which I enjoyed and would be interested in trying again.

Rating could go up.

*Update* Have played a few times now.  This is a good, tight COIN.  Is best in my opinion for how quickly it plays.  Some seem to prefer the tight quarters.  Personally, outside of time constraints, I'd chose Falling Sky, A Distant Plain or Liberty or Death over it.

RATING: 7.75
First of the COIN series I have tried.  The game ran six hours for the two players, but I was riveted the whole game.  Really like the asymmetry of the sides, the action selection order and two card available mechanism, really makes you not only consider your move, but potential moves of your opponent, and how you need to set up for your following move.  Tense, and pretty equally balanced, although the Syndicate appeared a bit less interesting to play.  Would be very excited to play again, and I will definitely look into other games of the series.

Rating based on only one play which was more of a learning game... not sure about this one.  Game feels abstract, like a complicated area control eurogame.  

Not that this is a bad thing, but I expected the game to have more wargame like elements and a stronger "feel" for counterinsurgency operations.

Game play is nicely asymmetrical and the game system is flexible, and relatively streamlined, but I don't have a strong sense of the historic situation.  Willing to play again.  Maybe.

This is a monster of a game. I dig the asymmetry. The tension of when to play and when to hold is very nice, though often you find yourself in a no-win situation. What bothers me though is the hot potato aspect. Holding your win condition until the random propaganda card draw is incredibly difficult and piling on the leader has an almost Munchkin quality to it. I can see why fans of the genre would enjoy this one but it's not for me.

Only played once so far, would love to play again. (UPDATE) So now I've played a few times which makes me a salty veteran I suppose and all I can say is that I love this game. I can't compare it to the more in depth COIN games as I have yet to play them, but this game is filled with interesting interactions, drama, and narrative. It definitely favors Castro given the right card mix, but there are lots of interesting things to be done as the other factions. This game has really opened my eyes to the history of the Cuban Revolution and the simplicity of the game makes it so appealing to new players. This just gets top marks in my book. Excellent game.

RATING: 2
Only one play, but this was not my cup of tea.

If I had to describe it quickly, it would be as Twilight Struggle with four players. The basic framework is the same - use events or ops to establish area control. It's much more chaotic than TS though. The chaos comes from having four factions with different victory conditions, different available ops and variable turn order - it becomes difficult to plan ahead. The board might look very different the next time you're up. TS shines in that players can plan ahead to get the upper hand in the tug-of-war for areas. With four players, the tug-of-war becomes a free-for-all, where it's more about optimizing your play this turn than planning ahead. Less interesting.

This also suffers from the kingmaking issue found in most multiplayer conflict games (it's not a wargame). I don't mind kingmaking when it comes as an appropriate conclusion to an epic struggle between alliances. Here there's mostly chaos and then someone wins, possibly because another player picked them. Not as fun.

1-4 players

GMT´s COIN Series Game #2, designed by [person=772][/person] (a CIA national security analyst) and Jeff Grossman, covers the Cuban/Castro's Revolution.

At the moment (Sept 2014), the only COIN game that I own. 

The big question that I have regarding this hugely successful COIN series: Are the COIN games too scripted for me to enjoy? Shall my strategies have to follow a particular script to be successful?

If you're trying to get into the COIN series, you should probably start with Cuba Libre.  Tough decisions but with more muted consequences than with other titles make this a good "safe" place to start for new players.

As with most/all COIN games, the thematic tie-in is quite good, and this results in a historical flavour that is hard to beat.   Also a hallmark of COIN series games, the "fun-to-time investment ratio" is quite favourable.

Rating based on two plays. So far, it's one of the most interesting games I have tried for the last 2 years or so. Entertaining asymmetrical multiplayer game with impressively changing dynamics and very very thematic. All players are usually close to their victory conditions, temporary alliances are a necessity and bring immense fun without being too backstabby. Short play time (about 4 hours?), close finish, tactically demanding, sufficient amount of randomness. The overall feeling has a touch of Twilight Struggle and Chaos in the Old World. Worth of playing regularly, the tactical options are immense.

The rules are actually not difficult, yet it's hard to keep the overview of what can be done a) by yourself and b) the other players. It took me about 10 moves until the fog started to clear before my eyes. Still not completely sure about my opponents' available options.

UPDATE 2016: It takes about 3 plays to get into the flow.

The best part of the COIN system is the 'metagame' - the negotiation, bribery and banter that happen around the playing out of ops, special activities and events.
However, I have one doubt about this system, which arises from the deterministic way the ops and SAs generally work - a competent group can generally pull any leader back from a winning position, and most of, if not necessarily all of the four factions, will generally remain in spitting distance of each other throughout the game. This means the eventual winner is often determined by the last event card of the game, and who gets to act on that card.
Cuba Libre is no exception to this, but the small footprint and potentially shorter playtime make it a good testbed to find out if this system is for you.

I bought this through GMT as part of the P500 and was really excited to get hold of it. However, I just haven’t been able to get it to the table. I’ve played a number of times solo and once with two others, but that one time it fell flat (mainly due to me mis-judging one of the player’s capacity to understand and enjoy this type of game).

I am determined to get this one out to play with a group sometime soon as I really like the idea of the game and the mechanics too. Luckily it is still fun to solo thanks to the awesome bots that come with the game.

The smallest of teh COIN series amd probably the best to kick off with for this reason. Described by one reviewer as a knife-fight in a phone box there are few areas and little time, so it is a free for all from the word go.

RATING: 8
So while I still have yet to play this, I've finally sat down and read the rules. It's not as complex as I remember it being, but it might be due to the fact that I've now read the rules like 3-4 times over the course of several years. It really boils down to 1 of the 4 factions takes an action, does the event or passes. If you didn't pass or did an action last turn, you'll be eligible for an action next turn. Then potentially 1 more faction gets to take a (partial) action. Each side has it's own victory conditions as well as a slightly different set of actions they can do.

I think the hardest parts of the rules/game for me have been trying to figure out what the hell I should be doing with any side as well as what exactly each side represents and how that works historically. Since I'm not familiar with the history of Cuba, it adds just that much more to the learning of the game. I believe it to be that the government is the stability of Cuba and you have 3 separate insurgents trying to gain control or over throw the government. None of the sides are really "good" although the blue government player does have support of the US. The green player is less against the government and just wants to run casinos while the red actively wishes to destroy it and get a rally going with opposition. Yellow seems like it just wants to control as much of Cuba as it can.

I think this is probably best a 4 player game, but it does play all counts. I don't know how I feel about the bot factions, but I haven't really sat down with them to see.

Rules are badly structured, though tutorials help quite a lot. The engine is impressive, possibly though without 'bots. For, admittedly, flow charts for 'bots are most of the times quite sybilline, unless one already has a firm grip on the rules; unfortunately, the latter feat faces recursive failure in case one is altogether striving for having a firm grip on the very rules... Recursive matters at work...

the title is so amusing that it nonetheless ranks top-notch...

Just getting a handle on the COIN series. First game took way, way too long with very difficult winning conditions and a tit-for-tat repetativeness that left me rather drained. I was hoping for multi-player Labyrinth and missed the dice rolls for successful operations. Game looks great and not overly complex - other three players, having played the game once before, seemed to enjoy the banter and decision making. 

UPDATE: Two player (re)learning game and a solo game playing all four factions. Really enjoyed it. Made a lot more sense and we did get through moves quickly. Now need to play once more with four to see if Cuba Libre is for me. Still a bit worried about the length - when will a COIN title be released for two players exclusively?

It really is El Grande pumped up with wargame chrome and process. Or license for wargamers to enjoy a euro game. Still, it is very clever. The eligibility grid is genius. The asymmetry in goals and capabilities really works well. And the variability of the cardplay and turn order gives a lot of variability to what could otherwise by an overly airless and computational contest. 

Like most of these kind of games, it wants repeated play to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the factions, who's a threat at any given moment. If you can't tolerate bash the leader, whining, and kingmaking, steer clear.

Second installment of the COIN series, and probably my least favorite. I like the much bigger games and narratives provided by the other titles. Some say this is a good intro to the COIN system, but I'd suggest that AA is the better starting point. There are no LoC's comparable to the other games, and understanding how to use those (and cut them off) is a big part of playing the other games. I think AA does a better job of hitting all the basics.

After the play of "Cuba Libre" we had a similar feeling as we had with other GMT games: we love them and we hate them. Of course we love them because of their immense historical depth, the components (especially the cards with themeful original pictures) and the mechanics (here: COIN). But we hate them as well ... during our play of "Cuba Libre" (1st edition) we had to read the rulebook again and again which was totally annoying and quite frustrating. In addition to that player aids told different things than the rulebook or even errata found on BGG.
I enjoyed playing with the "Mob" and all the money and casinos. But I'm also glad that I swapped this game into "Blood Rage" which for sure will hit the table much more often.

I've only played once, with Syndicate as bot which slowed the game down beyond it being our first play. So, I've not experienced the "quicker play than Andean Abyss" yet, but I see the potential. 

The waiting to swoop in for the win at the last minute, bash the leader criticisms are valid and felt. If people play quickly, I don't mind this so much. The cards make it quite interesting; the main operations become quite repetitive and tying the actions invariably with the special activities doesn't help matters any.

Still listening, but unlikely to be convinced. Curious to play this again and possibly the forthcoming Angola volume. Something further back in history would considerably up the appeal for me.

This is my first COIN game and although I was not sold on the setting, I really do like the way it plays.  The COIN mechanics are not really difficult, just different which is a nice challenge.  This would be my choice for entrance into the system due to its size and play time.

There is a lot of depth to this system, one play can give you the essence of the mechanics but not the depth of strategies needed to win consistently.  All 4 factions play differently which is something I really enjoy in a multi-player game.

My only concern is playing the govt.  If you don't win early then it's a difficult path to victory and there is one very strong event that can really hurt when played.

Szabályolvasás után nem vállalkoztam a játék elmondására, szerencsére adódott alkalom tapasztalt játékossal való játékra, de még így is nehéz a szabályt, főleg a frakciók egyes akcióit még tapasztalt játékosoknak is elsőre befogadni. Emiatt az első játék mindenképp tanulójáték, de megkockáztatom még a második is. Nekünk 6 óra volt szabállyal elsőre, ami nem kevés és sajnos nem is nyújtott akkora élvezetet, mint az ilyen játékidejű más játék, mondjuk a Dominant Species, vagy a Twilight Struggle. A szerző folyamatosan ontja magából a COIN játékait, amelyekben mindig 4 frakció feszül egymásnak valamilyen történelmi esemény alapján. A Cuba Libre a kubai forradalmat dolgozza föl, ahol a kormányt próbálják a kommunista és antikommunista felkelők megdönteni, közben az alvilág a jelenlegi hatalom maradását próbálja segíteni. Mindenképp érdekes a két lázadó és a két másik fél kapcsolata a játékban, mert sokszor egymás segítségére vannak utalva. Fantasztikus az alapmechanizmus, amelyben a 4 frakció közül maximum 2 tevékenykedik egy körben és aszerint, hogy mit választ az első a második akciófajtája fixálódik. A sorrendet a véletlenszerűen felforduló eseménylapok adják. A TS-hez hasonlóan általában az események a kártyákon erősebbek, mint egy-egy saját akció, amik viszont bonyolultak és nem könnyű átlátni mikor melyiket érdemes bevetni, főleg, hogy egyes akciókhoz speciális plusz akciók is társulhatnak. A játék pozitívuma még a kiegyenlítettség, a játék végén mindegyik fél nyerhetett volna, nagyon tematikusan a kormány dolga egyre nehezebb az amerikai támogatás csökkenése és a forradalmárok számának növekedése miatt. A játék negatívuma viszont a holtidő, mert egyes lépések végiggondolása nem könnyű dolog, bár az is igaz, hogy a következő eseménylap is látszik így van némi esély az előre tervezésre. A játék jól működik, látszik, hogy nem kevés időt feccöltek bele, lehet az első játék nyögvenyelősége miatt nem volt olyan az élmény. Muszáj vele még játszani.

1 play, 4er

This is a pretty neat game system! I'm not sure if I'm a big fan yet, but I think I could be. Unlike other CDGs I've played, you don't get a hand of cards. Instead, you just work your way through the deck: you see the card for this turn and the next. Each card has a row of faction icons at the top. No more than 2 of the 4 factions will be able to act each turn, with priority going from left to right (skipping players not eligible this turn, since they acted last turn). The cards have an event (which may be chosen by one of the eligible players), or a faction may conduct operations -- each has a unique set of available actions, although there are many common actions as well (e.g., rally to place guerrillas, march to move). Scoring cards (4) are shuffled into each quarter of the deck. When they come up, if no one has won (each faction has very different win conditions) then each faction earns resources (again, in a very different way).

So, overall it seems pretty cool; but hard to learn, since the factions are so different!

Very good entry in the COIN system.  Very accessible in terms of game size, setup, and playtime.  The game offers an excellent solo experience playing either the Govt or 26July.  The beauty about the system is that having learned one game, the others are just that much easier to get into.  I really appreciate the diverse nature of the subject matter for the series and Cuba Libre offers a very interesting setting.  As a bonus one gets to learn a little about the history of the country.  This game feels tighter than Andean Abyss and I feel like I have more control with less interference.  In other words my plans seem more likely to succeed than say in AA.  I prefer this to AA at the moment due to the fact that it is easier to set up an play than AA and the control factor.  As usual absolutely top notch components.  [b]This is an excellent solo game.[/b]

All of our group (many of them hard-core, brain burning, engine building, highly analytical,happy-to-stay-up-til-way-late heavy gamers) tried several times to like this game, but all just found it unenjoyable, hard work. Maybe, when we're retired and have time to play it several times until it becomes intuitive, it will start to be fun. But at the moment my abiding memory of every game is the Mafia player saying, 'So, I just need to found casinos, right? For three hours? Oh, OK...'

This game just rubs me the wrong way. I then found out that cfarrel already has put into words how I feel about the game, so I will simply copy (parts of) his comment:
______________________________________________________

... From a purely game perspective, all the different faction victory conditions are simply too hard to achieve given even minimally competent opposition, leaving everyone flailing, bashing the leader, and nobody even remotely capable of winning. The DR and 26July victory require controlling most of the island in the face of 3 other players who can all fairly easily hose you, which is essentially impossible. Meanwhile the Government actually does have some chance to win quickly if the other players are negligent, but they so rapidly enter a (historical but completely un-fun) death spiral of knee-capped capabilities that if they don't win more or less immediately, they find themselves bored out of their skulls as winning becomes impossible and they simply lack any interesting options. At best they get to decide who else wins. The Cartels have a shot at least - their victory conditions are at least theoretically achievable even without outrageous luck or incompetent opponents - but with only 4 guerrillas available to garrison their casinos it's still fairly easy for anyone to knock them back.

Despite being so much more compact and apparently more manageable than the other COIN games, it's still borderline unplayable for your first several games. The Government still has their complicated process of building up support which is really hard to understand, the factions all have complex interactions, and most of everyone's operations are going to be relatively futile. So until you get significant experience with the COIN system, it's still just going to take too goddamn long to play and be way too much of a grind - 4-ish hours which, while not terrible by the scale of the appalling length of Andean Abyss (or anything other than the short game of A Distant Plain), is still way too long for what the game is...

...From a game perspective, this is really a mess and only fun for about half of the playtime. As a history, all of the COIN games are a bit of a joke, but this one moreso than most: the DR is pretty much created from whole cloth to have an analog to the AUC, the Syndicate likewise is just the Cartels with a coat of paint and not much relation to the actual Cuban business interests, and this whole conflict was really just one of a corrupt and incompetent government toppling more or less of its own accord with Castro providing the shove. All these weird factional interactions just don't bear much resemblance to the actual event, or at least are wildly out of proportion to any real historical relevance. It was just a case of we have this COIN system, let's cram Castro's revolution onto it...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Card-driven asymmetrical game set during the Cuban Revolution. Like other games in the ‘COIN’ series there are four different factions each vying to achieve very different victory goals and the game is driven by cards determining turn order and the option of triggering an event. Players then use available resources to perform certain actions depending on the faction they control e.g. recruit, move, attack etc. The brilliance of this game, like others in the series, is the balance players have to strike in aiming for their own victory conditions whilst preventing opponents from achieving theirs, which can be difficult due to their asymmetry. Due to the smaller map it plays quite differently from the series’ previous effort ‘Andean Abyss’ and this leads to far more direct competition within specific areas, resulting in ‘CL’ being an absorbing and tense game requiring sophisticated strategies for success.

My rating would likely be a little or a lot higher if I played Cuba Libre as a multiplayer game, but as a solitaire game, this thing was a chore to learn and play. 95% of the time I spent interpreting the instructions for the 3 different opposing factions and tallying points rather than playing. The fact that every single solitaire video I watched had the players get something wrong during almost every turn shows the many ambiguities and untidy clerical duties that are required by Cuba Libre's solitaire "programing". (And I play ASLSK, Mage Knight, D-Day at Omaha Beach, Cave Evil, Perdition's Mouth, and many other games that are considered far heavier.)

There are some clever ideas aqui en Cuba (eg. the guerillas going underground, the base building, the casino skims), and the components are very well made, but it was advertised as having a solitaire design, which for me did not work out. "Play" required so many different (and unclear) flow charts for the 3 AIs that the solo mode seemed like an abstruse add-on to what is likely a pretty good 4 player game design.

So I'll put an asterisk next to my critical review, which was from the perspective of somebody who was looking for a rich solitaire  wargame (favorites include: D-Day at Omaha Beach, Thunderbolt Apache Leader, Ambush!, Warfighter WWII, and Zulus on the Ramparts!, etc.), but found an unclear, patchwork AI system that was all work and no play.

My first stab at a COIN (COunter-INsurgency) game.  Probably a good one to start with, too, because the small map naturally limits the choices one needs to consider.  In short, I liked it, and would like to try others in the series.  

Mechanically, it's a relatively complex area control game (not really a war game, I don't think) with highly differentiated factions.  I'm not sure if the factions are well balanced, which might be an issue.

Thematically, the history as it is portrayed is interesting, but I don't know anything about it so can't comment on how accurate it is.

I do think the player aides are poorly written, making the game more difficult to learn than it needs to be.

Notes after one play as Directorio: I won't rate because it would probably be unduly harsh. Found this to be a very dry experience with almost every move I made obvious; I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what I was missing but, no, the best move was always obvious and I came within a hair of winning twice.  While I know it's rooted in theme, it felt very abstract to me and was not exciting or tense at any time.  The COIN system is obviously very innovative but I don't know if this is a great use of it; maybe it'll get developed into something more interesting to me.

Hunted down this one because it's the quickest and smallest COIN so far. And it adds to my collection of games with a "revolution" theme. My first play was already great - yes, the game is deep, but not too complex or fiddly. A few events gave me questions and sometimes the bot was not overly clear, but nothing really play-breaking. Fantastic system, looking forward to more plays.

RATING: 7
[thing=111799][/thing] is a game that recreates (somewhat) the events in Cuba in the years of 1956-57. [thing=111799][/thing] is part of the COIN (Counter Insurgencies) series. In this game players take the role of one of four different factions:
- 26 July (Fidel and his buddies);
- Sybdicate (the mafia);
- Government (allies of the US);
- Directory (the students).

All of these factions has unique objectives in the game, and also has different actions (though they are similar). The core of the game is: every turn the Event card will show which will be the order of action in the turn. At first, every faction are available to take action, but only the first two will be able to do something. However, once these two take their actions, they won't be eligible for the next turn - thus they won't to anything. This makes the decision for [u]when[/u] to do something as important as to what to do, because the factions will usually only take one action for every two turns.

Also, the first player to choose an action defines what the next one will be able to do. The table works as follows:
- Faction OP only (do a full normal action) ---> Faction limited OP (a normal action, but limited to only one region);
- Faction OP with special activity (a full normal action plus a special action) ---> Faction limited OP or Event (use the event card);
- Event ---> Faction OP with special activity.

So, if you want that the next faction, no matter which, do only a limited action, you can choose to do only a normal (full) action, it is worst than do the OP with the special activity, but this would open the Event for the next faction to act on it. Therefore, not only is necessary for the first player of the turn to choose which action to take (considering that he won't be able to do anything in the next turn) while also pondering about what he will allow the next player to do.

All the factions play differently - the 26 July and the Directory have almost the same actions, but the Events of them, and the objectives set them well apart - which gives a great feel for the game, and makes the replay value higher.

One thing that must be said is that [thing=111799][/thing], though a great game, [b]isn't a wargame[/b] - from what I take as wargames. [thing=111799][/thing] has more things in common with [thing=93][/thing] and [thing=62219][/thing] than with [thing=21050][/thing] or [thing=243][/thing]. For me it is a area control / area majority with goals and high level of "in your face" actions. Again, this isn't a negative point, it is just a point of warning to avoid frustrations.

A very wide field of play. [b]Twilight Struggle[/b] remains the closest analog I can think of, with [b]Cuba[/b] being more freestylin' but less enigmatic. Hmmmmm...  on second thought maybe [b]Dominant Species[/b] is the best comparison... so, OK, [b]Cuba[/b] is the bastard love child of TS and DS.

This is a fierce, combustible multiplayer wargame that extends the idea of "card driven" with a delicious deck driven mechanic that is truly an innovation in gaming. The extremity of the asynchronous factions - both in set up & allowable actions/resources - is an exquisite, tentacled thing that provides some brutal moments.

With the same complexity of [b]Andean Abyss[/b], yet a tighter field of play (the board is half the size) and quicker playtime (the card deck is smaller but carries the same 4 propaganda cards that control game tempo), this reduced package hasn't lost any of the juice that made the COIN series a powerful new idea in historical gaming. And in gaming period. My comments on Andean Abyss apply in general terms.

Volko Ruenke's evolving ideas are beautifully distilled into a tighter frame & recast historicity by Jeff Grossman. And GMT delivers on the same high quality of components & player aides, including examples of play & enough historical context to comprehend why factional mechanics & goals dovetail into game choices.

It seems doable to play this in 3 hours with an experienced table.

The COIN style of games just don't capture my imagination.  The effort to learn the game is high and the abstraction doesn't grab my attention.  I have only played it solo.  I'm sure it would be more interesting with four players.

Mor than any other game I know, a knife fight in a phone booth.  Great for calculating, experienced gamers who enjoy making plans and having them thwarted.  Tenuous allegiances that can't possibly last (but are sometimes enforced against your will) only make it better.  I expect this one to become a Gents' Group staple for years to come.

Praise upon praise for this game. It is my first COIN game and is my favorite so far (Fire in the Lake just got here). The theme really gets me. Yes, it's a bit more euro instead of wargameish, but man, it's intense. I finally have the bot system down too so I can enjoy a good solo play.

El Directorio is easily my favorite faction.

I really like the COIN system.  This one is smaller than A Distant Plain, so it's easier to manage the pieces, and it is also a bit easier to keep all of the faction goals and actions in mind.

This is it. Same mechanics as "Andean Abyss", but just better in every respect. Smaller map means less play time, but more agonizing decisions since every move makes you rub shoulders with everyone else in the game. And the period of time covered is just more interesting. A solid improvement in the COIN series.

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#000000]1P[/BGCOLOR][/COLOR] My first delve into the COIN series. A card-driven asymmetrical game set during the Cuban Revolution. It's more of a political area control game than a wargame. It takes a couple of plays to fully understand and be able to strategize using each faction's actions, but once you know your stuff the game really shines. A huge plus is that the game is playable solo against bots. The bots are a bit easier to manage than in the other COIN games. Cuba Libre is considered to be the best entry level COIN game, and is often referred to as a "knife fight in a phone booth" due to it's smaller map size compared to the other games in the series.

This is by far the easiest game in the COIN system to sink your teeth into. What you'll find is a system that is both frustrating and fascinating all at once. The entire game is in a constant state of gridlock, with everyone seemingly one point from winning, but never able to quite reach the last point without the other three sides working together to block it. The game state seems to change every single turn, but the end result is always someone falling just short of winning.

On the off chance that someone does win, it usually feels like a lucky break. Usually it means they over extended into a position that was impossible to maintain and then they got lucky when a propaganda card flipped and awarded them the win, for being in the right place at the right time.

Well, that makes the game seem like a terrible waste of time. But really, what better way to simulate a war in the era of 24 hour media coverage? It doesn't matter who has the best position or who has the logistical advantage. It only matters who looks best when the cameras show up on the scene to report the status of the war.

And usually, 5 minutes after the cameras leave...the whole thing collapses and it all starts again.

You will end most games a step or two past where you started, making you wonder if the time investment was even worth it. I don't know, but I have to say, it seems to be a thematically appropriate question.

RATING: 9
The polarizing nature of counter intelligence operations has kept me kinda cool to the idea of a COIN game designed by someone inside The Beltway.  What I discovered with Cuba Libre was a very original and smooth (although there is a fair amount of fine detail) game where my fears of aversion to the political presentation were not borne out.  Jeff Grossman's Designer Notes recap the history with remarkable evenhandedness and it is reflected in the game.  What I find original is the four players' worth of balanced asymmetry and the positioning for Sequence of Play.  The Sequence of Play mechanism coupled with the event cards makes for more than a modicum of brain burnin'.  Advantages in the game are very tenuous and frequently elusive.  Be prepared to tread water.  Feels like a Euro because of its abstraction and reduced chaos.  Feels like a wargame because of its political nature and conflict.  A great innovative design and a very pleasant surprise.  Just plain fun to play.  I look forward to many more plays.

Coin series solitaire war game reenacting Castro's revolution in Cuba.  Propaganda, momentum, rally if there is no support, events, subvert, casinos, get resources equal to  population, guerrillas, area control. Interactions of several factions; Govt, directorio, syndicates, and US alliance. Flowcharts determine the non-player controlled faction.

If you hollowed out a wargamer's body and a eurogamer crawled inside, this is what you would get.  The eyes would slide around uncomfortably under the loose sockets, and the teeth wouldn't line up properly with the mouth, but it would still be your same old eurobuddy underneath - only with casinos, assaults, terror, and historically interesting events to add a sense of danger and veracity.

I like the two-players-per turn system, since it cuts playtime in half and makes for some interesting ops/events/passing decisions.  But even at half-time the game is too long. I would never play with a complete deck, for instance.* I'll always remove 6-8 cards to make the game shorter.

Random play order can really hurt, though.  In our first game my faction (government) was listed as 3rd or 4th in turn order for 10 straight turns, and I suffered as a result.  Getting to play an event once in a while must be nice.

Up next: [i]Fire in the Lake[/i] to see how the games compare.

Another winner in the COIN series.  This one has a different feel from Andean Abyss and a Distant Plain.  There are fewer provinces and pieces so you tend to have several factions in each province which dramatically increases the player interaction.  The one downside is that late in the game, you might find yourself fighting with the same player over the same thing and neither of you have any viable alternatives so you can churn quite a bit making an action and then having your opponent reverse it only to have you redo it again.  I found the game to be balanced between the factions, but this also made it a bit harder for someone to complete their victory condition.  This is why I'm giving this a slightly lower rating than the other COIN titles.

The core theme of a socialist insurgency could make me sick, but fortunately the opposition is much more interesting. Mob gangsters, anti socialist students and ruthless dictatorship are there to win my heart.

Gameplay creates a unique story, an alternative history of stuff that actually went down. Before seeing it in action, I hated the idea of missing Hand Management, but the Card Drafting mechanic of COIN is simply brilliant. COIN is the best effort of multiplayer wargame with Variable Player Powers and unique victory conditions I have seen. Some factions are natural allies, some not so much, but their goals aren't necessarily diametrically opposite. Every decision in the chaotic insurgency/counterinsurgency situation takes all the brainpower a player has in this easy to learn but difficult to win epic system.

Great game. I will explain why this is better than AA (which I also like). Its quicker( a one session game), its more intense and most importantly all factions are in it from the start...(AUC is a rather tag along faction in AA IMO). M26 is hardest to win with and novices may want to give them a capability from the start to get them competitive. Avoid the Deception counters that are there for jaded Veteran players. Great game moving to the top of the COIN pantheon  in my book (AA has been relegated to a good 3 player game). NB I have no experience with ADP.

Nice system. But:
-Luck which cards appears before the Victory check cards and can decide who wins. 
-The game will be decided mostly in the last 1-2 rounds.
-Bash the leader 
-Less strategy but much tactic playing.

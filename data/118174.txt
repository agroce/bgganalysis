I'm hoping that the rating can go up after a few more plays.  Having played only 3+4 player games I've noticed a run-away leader problem but hopefully we can resolve this with a simple variant and maybe after people get more familiar with the game.

This is basically a trading game. However when we played it there was very little trading. There didn't seem to be enough incentive to trade. Compared to a trading game like Bohnanza there are much fewer types of items and so it is easy to get what you want without trading. Fires can brake out which I guess are designed to make it feel like a race to complete sets, however they weren't particularly threatening in the game we played. I'm not sure if the game can be fixed by rule modifications. I think a redesign were the number of elements was increased and fires broke out more easily could be a lot more fun.
The game has great theme and had lots of potential

Yet another game that is for 3+ players, although they modify the rules to get more couples to buy it. 'Chemistry Textbook' (Rule book) has errors and really does not explain itself that great. They thank playtesters, so I guess I should thank them for this mess!! 

Please, People of Earth, This is NOT for 2 players. This is a 3+ player game.

Please tell me again how this is a FUN 2-player game? Oh, you can't!

You can tell how bad a game is by the number of intelligent people who are confused by the rules that were supposedly reviewed by dozens of experts.....

I also feel like I am some sort of tard for backing a java sort of project these ponzi's have schemed as I am now locked in to receive the next batch of beta games in their collection. 

When will I learn?

Unique mechanics, from my perspective. You do not need to know chemistry to play, but if you do the theme is that much more appealing as close attention was paid to details such as ionic vs covalent nature of bonds in the pictures. If you don’t know chemistry, the game is still very fun as my son enjoyed playing this at age 7.

Bought this for my chemistry loving son. The game can be fun. Basically, you're drawing colored elements from a bag and claiming compounds on the board. You score for each compound you complete and advance your research capabilities in the lab. The scoreboard is a periodic table, which is pretty cool. It's not super educational, but it's a unique theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun thematic game that does not drag out longer than it should. It needs more types of compounds (however, I am no chemist and not sure what could be added), it's possible to win by simply getting the easiest compounds. The Lab fires are not as terrifying as they sound and have rarely effected the outcome of the game. Overall it is enjoyable play and not too difficult to learn.

A set collection game that fell flat with us.  There is a decent amount of blocking/screwage and too much luck and chaos.  Flammable compounds blow up too quickly, and there seems to be a rich-get-richer problem (i.e., players who are lucky enough to improve the right abilities can easily continue improving them while others lag behind).

A nice chemistry game where you are pulling elements from a bag to try and complete compounds to be able to score them.  I liked this more than tower because there was a lot more you can do with the elements then just a couple cards.  Also the addition of the lab equipment added elements to keep the experience varied.  I need to play this with more people because with two it seemed to lack competition.  But I would gladly play this game again.

This isn't a bad game... Then again I'm not sure I'd ever just bring it to the table. Most of the components are really nice and the gameplay is themeatic, but it just doesn't hold my attention. I had a really hard time getting engaged and careing about what I was doing. I can't really name something in the game that I specifically didn't like, but the game as a whole just wasn't that interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very light, easy game with mechanics that are thankfully totally unrelated to studying chemistry. The game is kind of like Ticket to Ride: collect colors to fulfill card requirements before other players. The difference is that there is a little tech tree to increase your draw count and hand size as well as allow you to claim more cards on the board. Fun and lighthearted, though bad draws from the bag can be really frustrating (especially if all you need is one yellow, which for some reason I always call "Selenium").

Components (1.2/2.0) Player boards are good.  I'm not overly in love with the game board as I feel it's a bit too big once you set up the playing field (I do like the attempt with the periodic table).  I DID NOT like the stickers that had to added to the game pieces.  Cards are good quality and while I sleeved them, it doesn't feel necessary.  The gems are nice to work with.  

Structure (1.4/2.0)The theme is good and is carried out fairly well.  Your working in a chemistry lab trying to make compounds.  The chemistry is wonky but I'm biased(:)).  The mechanics of the turn rounds can feel a bit clunky and sometimes slow the game down.  The instructions were clearly written but I still like I have to go back and review the rules in each game.  Teaching is ok (20minutes) but feels a bit much for how long the game should take.  

  

Experience (0.5/1.0)  Not one you are going to come back to over and over again but is ok for on occasion playing.  

Enjoyment (3.0/5.0)  The game wears out it welcome as it can take 2 hours to play.  I cannot suggest a fix unless you cut into the number of points required to end the game.  The game phase mechanics while I think are fine, seem clunky and just drags out the game.  The mechanics of trading and dealing with others (See Catan) can turn off players as this game can get nasty.  I'm ok with the nastiness.  However when everybody is playing kind to each other, the game just drags out and can be boring.  

Replayablility (0.4/1.0)  It will be tough to bring this game out to groups for replays.  Just doesn't bring what is needed to allow for it.  Will hang on to the game for theme but eh.....

Overall (6.5/10.0) This game has potential but issues.  It overstays its welcome and unless the group wants to be mean to each other, it just feels a bit dull.  The game has had moments of good fun though thus I'm not giving up on this one.

Heard about this from a friend who got it on Kickstarter.

Do NOT be intimidated by the science theme.  When I was learning the rules I thought this was going to be primarily an educational game.  Yes, the compounds on the card are legit, and some of the things you acquire I haven't thought about since college chemistry class (burners, beakers, carbon, etc.).  However, it's just the backdrop for a fun game.  The periodic table is the score board.  I thought it would be some complex reference sheet for the elements--it's not.  

Cool gems, varying mechanics.  You are building points by building compounds.  You need to build up capabilities to exponentially grow.  Watch out for lab fires as they reset the board if you're not careful.

I really liked this one--not obsessively, but really good.  I plan to break it out a few more times to master it a little better.

Compounded's upgrade system causes a runaway leader problem. When you realise, about a third of the way through, that there's no way you're going to catch up, it really sucks the joy out of the game.

RATING: 5
A solid attempt to make chemistry into an interesting euro-style game, and it has a creative scoreboard, but it just doesn't quite work due to the coarse scoring and the lack of any real ability to catch the leader. A bad set of elements early in the game could set you back and, unless someone gets really unlucky with the lab fires, there's not much you can do.

Another issue was the fire extinguisher. I think the original idea was that players with high research would be forced to dump their elements on unclaimed research, thus leaving them open for other players to claim. Unfortunately, the fire extinguisher provides a sort of safety valve where you can dump that black or red chemical, instead of placing it on the board. The end result was that there was no real research stealing. If I ever play again, I would just start the fire extinguisher on its built side, and make it a one-shot that's removed from the game afterwards.

So, a nice family and/or educational game that teachers could play with their students, but for me the gameplay was just too flat.

Players are chemists, working in a laboratory, collecting elements and forming them into compounds for points and technology advances.  A fairly by the numbers set collecting game, wrapped up in some good theme, uneven production, and uncertain mechanics.  A trading mechanism, similar to Settlers of Catan, is inserted to prevent runaway leader problems.  A great score track (a periodic table) is one of the game's highlights.  Very tiny fonts on the player boards we all found a real hindrance.  A typical Kickstarter game - good idea that needed professional development to go that extra yard.

RATING: 7.5
Rated after 2 plays. This game works for our family because we enjoy chemistry and negotiation. Very simple to learn and teach. Lab fires can be a bit brutal, no one seems the least bit interested in making their fire extinguisher as it’s only good for one use. Game seems balanced with the ratio of gems needed and the card requirements. Rarer elements can cause some negotiation to commence, if you play carefully and focus on increasing one piece of your lab at a time, you can use those elements when drawn to your advantage. I would get this out with the right crowd and our teenage kids really enjoyed playing.

This game had some really cool things going on, not the least of which was its clever application of theme.  Unfortunately, when played, it turned out to be nothing but a luck-fest.  Everything depended upon getting lucky when drawing your elements from the bag....

[b][FirstImpression/PlayOn26thMARCH2014][/b] This game reminds me of Vivajava: The Coffee Game by the same publisher. The part where the interaction lies reminds me of the it.

Claiming a compound feels like when you claim/brew the coffee in Vivajava. Your personal board where you improve and unlock certain abilities also reminded me of the one in Vivajava. The drawing random elements from the bag also reminisce me of Vivajava.

Overall, I find the game to be okay. A pretty simple game about fulfilling orders to get points - if you can put it that way.

I played a 5 players game, and it didn't drag. It took us probably 60 mins to get it finished.

A game for people who are able to keep a million things running in their heads at once. Ultra-fiddly, ultra-game-management-oriented, and brain-numbing. Looks like a lighter game but plays almost medium-heavy because there is so much to keep track of PLUS it adds in negotiation, which is a mechanic best served by simpler games. "Which phase are we in?" was constant. Forgetting to do this or that was rampant. I do not like this trend of games made for accountants. They aren't all that fun. Was on my wishlist, but now scratched. Great concept that needed more elegant gameplay that flowed better. This was in testing for four years? Really??? And the tiny text and minuscule pieces were disappointing.

An interesting strategy game with satisfying physical quality and good theme integration.

This is a recipe game a la Fresco or Rococo with a chemistry theme. I found it reasonably OK with nothing to hate or love about it. There’s a fair bit of luck in pulls and I found the 3:1 trading a bit brutal b/c the 3 have to be the same type. So you have to be lucky in getting what you want or getting 3 of a kind of what you don't want so you can trade? Relax that and I’d like the game a lot more.

Played a two-player game to get a feel for it. Seems interesting, but overall played poorly with two. The Nobel dummy player was useless and trading with your opponent just doesn't happen.

Initial setup takes a little while due to all the tokens and bits. Running through the rule book the first time can be a bit daunting as well; lots of terms and can feel complex. I highly suggest setting it up, reading the rule book once or twice, and running through some turns by yourself before trying to teach a group. Once you make it a few turns everyone starts to get the gist of it. Fun game, lab fires can certainly be a surprise and the cause of much dismay. I feel it's best with the maximum of five people due to the trading phase.

RATING: 5.5
The theme really shines here and it was fun to play, although it did feel a little bit short, but then the turns felt quite repetitive. It a strange one. I wanted to play more but I was also a longing for more to do as turns were very very similar.  The lab equipment upgrades are nice and quite thematic but it is a shame the damn tokens are so small, and don't even get me started on the fire token!

:thumbsdown: to the tiny [size=7]tiny[/size] [size=5]tiny[/size] tokens.

Overall I think this will warrant a few more plays, to explore both the expansion elements and the lab partners variant.

Sold with expansion in 2016.

Really nice that the board is the Periodic table and the compounds are accurate, etc.  The cardboard chits are too small, the fire ones especially.  The elements are great. The bag(in the 2nd edition) is too small.

Game play is straight forward and your player board is also your player aid, which is nice. Fun to upgrade your abilities and have your selection of claims be affected by what upgrades you need.  There is some competition, to claim compounds and finish unclaimed compounds.

Enjoyable, but seems like it could be more.  More plays may clarify this.

Another Christmas 2015 gift.  This game was intriguing, but I'm afraid it's faux-complixity for the masses.  It is an interesting game and I like the bag draw mechanic, but we just don't get it to the table much.  I think I lean more towards Sierra Madre games if we're looking for a science theme.

A game that is probably best that want a science (specifically chemistry) theme to a game.  It is short, and fairly thematic with some amount of planning and choices.  The random draws of elements and compound cards push this game towards the luck heavy side but their is still enough skill in the game that the more skillfull player will win more games than the less skillfull player.  It was also had a short enough play time to keep it from dragging.  The end of game condition (any time someone gets to 51VPs) was an article of dissatisfaction with many of the players in my group.

One play with two players, two with three, one with four and two with five. Nice components and some neat ideas, but I feel like there are rough edges. If one player gets traction early he can be hard (impossible?) to catch, and having one of your compounds blow up on you is likely to knock you out of the running (which makes the use of the bunsen burner particularly nasty). It's not bad, really, but there are plenty of games that do something similar more cleanly.

Compounded is a very interesting take on chemistry, which is definitely underused as a theme. Building compounds and getting bonuses is a very neat idea. I've added the Geiger expansion, as well, which adds extra, juicy concepts to the game like asymmetric player powers and a radioactive doomsday timer.

With both put together, I find Compounded a lot of fun, as long as I'm not playing with someone who has serious analysis paralysis. There is a lot of fiddling with pieces and cards, and cleanup is not exactly a breeze.

Compounded stays in my collection, offering some very interesting mechanics, but it does not get taken to game day every single week.

I'm now 0 for 3 on Dice Hate Me Games - I guess they're just not to my taste.  Being a chemist I guess this game should appeal to me on theme alone, and I suppose it's implemented about as well as can be hoped for, but I just found this game really dull.  Strip all the chrome away and you're basically drawing stuff from a bag and putting it on the board in the most efficient way possible, while trying to upgrade your ability to draw more random stuff and place more stuff on the board.  Theoretically the trading should add that missing something, but in our game there was very little trading to be had since any trade basically gives your opponent just as many points as you would get (the low point spread on the cards pretty much guarantees it).  Perhaps the trading would improve with more players (we played with 3) but I don't think that would change the fundamental problems I have with this game.  I don't dislike the game, but I don't really like it either, hence the 5.

If there is one catch, it's that the really interesting things in this game happen (or should happen) during trading in the 'Discovery' phase.  If you have folks that embrace this aspect and are fairly creative, this game will shine.  If you have a more conservative bunch and/or the elements drawn don't lend themselves to trading opportunities, the game is just OK.

Quite fun! The theme makes it seem more complicated than it really is, so I may have a harder time convincing lighter players they actually do want to play it.

Some of the bits are excessively fiddly. The fire bits are quite small, and I feel like the table mat could've combined the Lab Cylinder with the Element Storage Area, eliminating the superfluous Storage Marker chits, which coincidentally are nearly the same color as the purple player's bits!

Otherwise, fairly fun little gem I'll definitely trot out later.

Amazing game for the following reasons:

Physical appearance: The weight and colors of this game are better than any I've seen. At first, the amount of setup and pieces seemed cumbersome and Intimidating, but after one game all pieces make sense and the game is helped and not hindered by the pieces and setup.

Gameplay: Again, at first the rules and phase style were intimidating, but within the first game, the gameplay becomes smooth and engaging. It manages to have a complex strategy while keeping a fast pace. 

Replayability: I feel like there are different layers of complexity to this game which will provide for a ton of replays while still learning the deeper strategies. During the first game, everyone was just trying to complete compounds quickly based on what elements they had at that time. I can tell that as we play the game more, we will have to build a strategy based on what experiments to level first, how to pick the best compounds based on what tools they give or if someone else really wants it and to use it as leverage for trading.

RATING: 5
Compounded has an interesting theme, clean art, and some clever mechanics, but it runs a bit too long for what it is. Like Catan (a game from which it steals an idea or two), the randomness of resource production can make or break a player. Strengthening abilities through research should be fun, but it often feels like one doesn't get much choice in how to research since that is determined by which compounds are completed - a decision mostly influenced by which elements one randomly draws.

Compounded also never really feels tense until the end of the game and there aren't a ton of interesting decisions to make to get there. That's why it might have been a solid 30-minute filler game, but it comes up much shorter than other games that run for 90 minutes.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (August 2015)

Sadly, there were a lot of rules issues when I played Compounded. I really hate when this happens because my boardgame time is limited and I hate to waste it playing games the wrong way. Due to this it took almost 3 hours to play it.

Having saying that, I really enjoyed Compounded. From the fresh theme to the clever mechanism it is a good design.

The game components are very good and the art is ok. The central board (Periodic table) is great. 

The rules (seem) very easy to learn and the gameplay can be very quick, only the trading can slow the game a bit. There is some luck when you acquire elements from the bag, but you know the probabilities. That, the trading and some powers you can acquire can mitigate the luck factor a lot, so in general terms, the luck factor doesn’t bothers me.

I’m not sure if players will try to get the flammable elements, they are very risky.

Bottom line, I think I will buy Compounded. It is a good game with a fresh theme and perhaps it will get an improved rating from me with more plays. It exceeded my expectations (but I will read the rules soon).

Current Rating: 6.5

I finally played Compounded again. It´s been almost 3 years since I last did so and I have changed a bit in this time.  I still think it is a good design and I would have rated it higher in the past.

The decisions needed to play the game aren’t very hard, but they aren’t obvious either. It seems it is hard to catch a runaway leader but I need more plays to verify this point. Players do take a lot of flammable compounds so I was wrong before. 

The game is very thematic, I have seen chemistry teachers really liking the game. The components are very well done, from the periodic table to the player´s boards.

Compounded comes with a variant I didn’t try, it has cooperative compounds (like Brew Crafters)  but I don’t really know how they work.

Bottom line, I will sell my copy of the game as I crave heavier games and my desire to play Compounded again is low, but I would play again if requested. I also had all its expansions but I will sell those too. Compounded is an ok game for me, but it doesn’t have much tension. It can be a good game for the family.

Since I have a B.S. in Chemistry, the theme of this game appealed to me right off. It is a fun middle-weight game that is pretty easy to teach and play.

Although the designer and publisher don't make any claims that this is a game to teach chemistry, I have heard people wanting to make the association or at least hoping there is one. Although, the structure and flammable properties of the chemical compounds in the game are accurately depicted, there really is no chemistry in the game beyond an interesting subtext. Buy this one for your after-school game group, not your chemistry class.

Seemed OK on the surface, and blended chemistry stuff with common board game mechanics well, but then the runaway leader issue emerged. The amount of trading was really minuscule, to the point of it feeling like an unnecessary mechanic. Perhaps it happens more with more players, but that implies a number of players problem. The theme can work but I don't think game development went as far as it needed to.

It's not heavy at all, but it's fun to trade elements, make deals, and then turn around and blow up each other's hard work with a bunsen burner.

The game plays you. The gems you draw from the communal bag and experiments available,  determine your decisions and hence you can't have any real strategy. I. E. You may want to focus on improving a particular skill but with the wrong gems/experiments you can't pick the experiments you want to go for. 

Once you get the hang of the game the mechanics are fairly simple.  For most of the game you'll have up to 2 cases to work on and with a limited draw of chemicals, it's easy to get stuck waiting for the right combination. A few bad draws could put you on the back foot and with no catch up mechanism can put you out of the game.

This game seems pretty easy to pick up (I got a bunch of my non-gamer chemist friends to play it because of the theme). However I feel like which elements you randomly draw out of the bag on your first few turns has too large of an impact on how well you perform in the game, as completing compounds early give you bonuses that cause a runaway leader syndrome. Yes you can negotiate to trade elements, but there are a couple elements that seem to show up way more often than they are needed (carbon, sulfur at least in the early game barring calcium sulfide upon setup), and so if you have these less desirable elements your trade options are limited, and doing a 3:1 trade to the bank is inefficient. The compounds themselves seem a bit imbalanced. I still quite enjoy this game, it just didn't live up to my initial hype for it. Really nice components for the elements. Note that while it is listed as 90 minute playing time here, on the box it is "30-90", and I have finished 3 player games in about 40 minutes before.

Nice game, just a feeling that the lab fire/volatile compound mechanic timing doesn't live up to the havoc one would expect as a strategic mean to foil other people's plans.
Also the trading thing seems a rule that has not such that use.

A chemical lab with the worst safety practices possible. If you even get your hands on some safety goggles you end up tossing them aside. Use a bunsen burner to overheat your fellow scientists experiments on a lark. The facility has fire extinguishers but they are empty, and if you want to use one you have to fill them yourself. Not really your typical lab, but quite funny.

The trading aspect can be a lot of fun but overall the whole game seems just really deterministic and boring. What random bag draws decently match the random card flips is the majority of the game. The parts I like are easily found as part or whole of far better games. It is a really good looking production though, big ups to the entire theming integration. Too bad the game itself isn't better.

Spectacular light-medium weight game.  I adore the theme.  Turns are quick with little down time but more than enough strategy to get you thinking.  It's not a brain burner by any stretch but it's no cakewalk either.  I'll be playing this one a lot. 

Also a little irritation here.  People who complain a game is too light.  If you like heavy games that's fine, but don't fault a light game for being what it is.  That's like saying "I didn't like this cheeseburger because I like chicken sandwiches".  That doesn't tell us anything about this item in front of us other than than the fact that you think you're special because you like 5 hour brainburners.

Game is fun, benefits from a novel and interesting theme and is nice to look at, but the components are too small, game play is fiddly, and a good start dependent on player order and resource draws is essential to do well. 

The game takes far too long for this kind of repetition. The three games I've played had no story arc. A couple players get out in front and their experiment levels allow them to complete more and more compounds. If the game was an hour long, that would be okay, but it's not.

I kind of hate rating the game like this because it looks good and I can appreciate the theme and effort, and it strikes pretty close to home.  But there are several things that bother me, including the frequent fires in the lab, the fact we are collecting atoms to build things like water, and the extreme luck of everything: the card draw, the element draw, advancement on charts... Pretty much you get funneled into a basic strategy of scoring as much and as often as you can.  It does not seem a good idea sitting about trying to build up specific proficiencies.  Also, it really bugs me we have to build our own fire extinguisher!  Also, it lasted way longer thank game with this randomness should.

2 player variant is not bad. It seems like one player can get a massive lead on the other if their skill levels are different.  Typically though, matches are very close with only a few points difference between players.

Random starting setup + strong runaway leader positive feedback cycle means whoever draws a winning recipe at startup time will get early powerups which will probably eventually win them the game. I was surprised by the positive comments, as the game was a dull slog of slowly watching the person with the luckiest setup win.

Some house-ruling might save it, because there's some goodness in here. Just needed more development before final release.

The production quality is nice, and the rewards for completing tasks are satisfying. Unfortunately, it's subject to a lot of randomness with the element draw bag, and the card flips that make up the "board" of available experiments. It also seems to have a bit of a snowballing problem for the point leader, who (by virtue of behind ahead) can complete experiments more effectively than others.

Game felt too long for what it was. The game hints at deeper interaction, but making non-binding deals seems like a high risk strategy whilst perfect information made trading too easily analysed. The only time you might consider co-operating on completing compounds would be to create explosions, but generally the cost in resources and moves isn't worth the potential pay-back (unless someone stands to score big and the explosion would scupper their plans).

Standard Euro fare attempted to be saved by the cool theme. With a special shoutout for including the periodic table as a score track - which automatically declares that you shouldn't be playing if you're not geek enough to be able to follow the numbers correctly when scoring. But when you get past the theme, what you have left is a standard collect resources / trade / build buildings before others can build them to earn VPs and increase your tech levels. All been done before. Increasing your tech levels gets you more cubes each turn, claim more buildings, put out more cubes to build buildings faster, and keep more cubes. Also all been done before. Those who are lucky to get the right cubes at the start to build buildings get a jump on the other players - their tech increases, allowing them to be continually a turn or two or three ahead of the other players, and there's precious little hit the leader. So, the rich get richer. With every turn being extremely tactical (go for buildings you get cubes for, don't trade unless you have to) there's a fair slice of luck in the game. Trading is good in theory, but that also requires luck - that you both have a cube spare which is exactly what the other needs. There's little point trading otherwise as there's no strategic long term play here. Combined with the lack of inspired gameplay, the rich get richer element lends the game an average rating.

Compounded is an order-fulfillment game with common contracts, using claim tokens to avoid the sniping issues often present in such games. Players draw random elements from a bag, and place them on the board to complete compounds to gain points and advance on your tech tracks. The tracks allow you to draw more elements, claim more compounds, place more elements, and store more elements from turn to turn. There was a fair amount of take-that, as players could gain tokens or complete compounds to set some unfinished compounds on fire, which hurt specific players with vulnerable compounds. I still enjoyed it though, as working on the tracks and managing the element resources was a lot of fun.

As a civil engineer in chemistry, I like the fact that there is a game with a Chemistry-theme. 

The exploding of compounds is also a nice twist, but for the rest I'm afraid we've seen it all before: evolve to take more elements, store more elements, put more elements on cards or being able to claim more cards and even the upgrades are classic as a pipet who gives you a better trade ratio or a book that gives you the ability to take 1 element back when you finish a compound. 

It's also a bit long, as it becomes somehow repetitive near the end, for what it is, but with experienced players you can probably bring playing time down somewhat. 

Plus is that it's easy to explain and all mechanics are logic.

I chanced upon this game last night when a friend of a friend brought it to a birthday party. I had been eying it for a while, but now I think I might have been convinced to get it. The game involves scientists working in a lab to create compounds (molecules) from elements that they have collected either through a random draw or through trade. For completing a molecule, they are rewarded with additional capabilities in the lab, items to use for special chemical preparations (bunsen burner, woo!), and victory points, the path to success. The competition in this game is fierce, with everyone vying to claim the most valuable compounds and driving hard trade bargains for the elements needed to complete molecules. The added pseudo-random addition of lab fires that can destroy compounds that players have been working so hard to complete adds another layer of tension to the gameplay. This was a surprisingly fun and interesting discovery and I look forward to additional plays!

Several games with 3, 4 and 5-players. Very good worker placement game that doesn't feel like the dreary multitude where oftentimes it feels futile in getting what you want although poor luck in early element draws can easily be fatal. The kickstarter components are more than adequate. Play is simple overall with the trading minimal and not too many opportunities for (excessive) screwage.

I allow all players to have access to the Lab Bench earned tokens, not the # players - 1 in the rules.

RATING: 7
A light game, that doesn't require knowledge of chemistry to play. You collect sets of components (elements) to complete compounds which provide victory points and a progressive growth in getting elements, reserving builds or retaining elements over turns. 
It is nicely chaotic since you can only reserve a limited compounds, lab fires can destroy what you are working, you may not get what you want. 
The meat of the game is its trading element. It mitigates the draw element and lab fires. You can trade most anything: elements, tools and especially promises to place an element for another player. Items especially useful for trades are thinks you can't take advantage - an element that will be discarded, a placement you can use 

I found using the periodic table as the scoreboard to be a nice touch. 

Overall a interesting little game that I would like to get table a few more times. One I'm glad I Kickstarted

This could have been a very dry and boring game, but a few excellent design decisions inject a ton of fun. At first glance, it seems like 90% of what you'll be doing is drawing tokens from a bag and taking turns placing them onto a board. When you start gaining lab tools and lab fires start spreading you soon realize how much more involved everything is, and how beautifully chaotic it can be.

It helps if you have a group of players who can get into the negotiation aspect of the game. We had a lot of trading and promises of future favors going around the table. As the game neared the end, players grew a bit more nasty, which actually brings me to my one complaints about the game- the bunsen burner. I feel like it's a bit too confrontational and overpowered, but I would never take it out of the game because it serves two very important purposes- keeping the lead player in check and keeping people afraid of flammable components.

Overall: Compounded is a game I can highly recommend, and with a handful of variants included in the rulebook it's easy to tweak it to each group's liking. A very nice surprise.

I really like the theme of this game: creating real compounds with the different elements, flammable compounds that can catch fire, periodic table for a score board.

I think theme was actually chosen over game-play or ease-of-use at times (it's actually a little confusing using a periodic table for scoring!)

Decent game with a slight run-away leader issue, but I just can't help but loving it.

This was alright. It really seems like the journal is key, as completing a compound with 2-3 elements including at least 1 rare element every round seems to be the key to winning. The difference in time spent to complete a compound should be more reflected in the points.

Love the theme. Fairly quick and light game. You're trying to complete compounds with the elements you randomly grab from a bag at the start of every round. Compounds will give you points and boosts to help you get even more through out the game (depending on the type of compound)

Just a few plays in so my rating may change after a few more games are under my belt? For starters, I hated Chemistry in school (except for the experiments) but this might be my "game of redemption". I think the theme works really well and I like the mechanic where the compounds can explode, scattering elements to adjacent compounds. I think the theme might scare some away from trying it, but I'm pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoy it.

A nice production, but there isn't a game here. I'm honestly not sure what is supposed to be accomplished as all you do is draw random elements out of a bag and then put them onto cards and score points. I suppose the trading is intended to mitigate the randomness, but it doesn't work. Everyone can see what you are going for and you're limited by how many you can place out so that gives your opponents no incentive to trade to help you out. I feel that there could be something here if more time was spent developing the game, but as is usually the case with these Kickstarter companies, a half-baked idea is enough for publication.

This game came as a complete and pleasant surprise when I tried a prototype version at Origins 2012. Great theme, great design, and the coolest score track I've seen.

There are lab fires, explosions, equipment with special powers, and frenetic trading periods that leave very little downtime. Kickstarted immediately.

A mix of area control, resource management and tech tree development.  The mechanisms are only loosely related to the chemistry theme of the game.  Have only played 2 players and would be interested to try with more, although I suspect that the research field would be very volatile.

A fun chemistry game.  I am a fan of chemistry so this easily scores an 8 for me, the theme is also totally under used so it gets further points for that.  The gameplay is also fun, and I particularly like how you can team up temporarily and the backstab players, it creates for a very interesting game environment.  

The goal of the game is to make molecules and score points for those molecules.  More complex ones are harder to make and therefore score more points.

With some more plays I might even score this game a 9, but the one thing that does bother me a little bit is having to worry about base stats that determine how you can play the game as in how many resources you get and can store.  These are difficult decisions to make and give a large advantage to experienced and good players.

I really like this game.  I do not like the trading.  It can be very easy for someone to play Kingmaker or to make trades benefiting a single player.  This is an issue I often find with games that allow trading, especially "open" trading, that they allow for pre-established relationships to overrun the game.

I am considering trying this game without trading at all, to see how that affects things.

I'm not sure how to feel about Compounded. I've enjoyed every game played so far, but I'm not in love with the game. We play primarily with two and the variant is fine, but I'm still not sure. It's not a game that will be leaving my collection anytime soon, but I'm going to be trying a few of the advanced variants to see if it spices the gameplay up any.

This is an interesting idea with a decently streamlined play. Play mechanics are simple to move through and have enough randomness to be a bit exciting. I do like the sense of progress towards building a compound.

I have a major disappointment with the physical design of the game: the text, counters, and icons are TINY. Big oversight here and it really slowed down the gameplay and learning our first time, needlessly. It's too bad, because the play itself is natural and smooth, but constantly pausing to fetch and fumble with tiny tokens or read reminder text in seven point font or smaller was frustrating for all. If this makes it to a second edition I'm sure it will be larger.

Also, the periodic table as a scoreboard--but only up to 50 and with no other bearing on the game--was underutilized, a disappointment.

Backed on kickstarter. 

Not wholly impressed, for various reasons. It takes far longer than it feels like it should for the weight of gameplay it offers. Not worth playing without the Lab Partners variant, even then I'm not sure. Probably going on the trade pile, need another play to be sure.

OK, here it all is - 

- The trading / negotiation aspect fell utterly flat for my group. Probably just a metagame issue here.


- Some of the lab tools do not feel balanced whatsoever (Pipette gives you a 2-1 trading ratio instead of 3-1 and if gotten early will swing games)


- What compound you're going for is pretty much determined by what you draw out of the bag... if what you draw matches what's out there to be completed, you've got it made. Wanna trade? Uh, nope.


- Component shortcomings - The text on player boards and some cards is TINY, and the flame tokens are MINUSCULE (Unlike the image on the kickstarter page, they are NOT wooden cubes, but tiny cardboard punches). Would it have been so hard to make them a reasonable size?


- The flammable compounds are RARELY worth it, unless you luck out and draw that exact combination of elements so you can complete it in one turn.


- Overall it just felt very dry, lacked tension, and it seemed to take twice as long as it should based on the overall weight of gameplay. For a game that supposedly has a lot of trading and negotiation, it's ultimately very solitary. People just don't trade... trade future favors? Trade tools? Come on, were we born yesterday? It just doesn't work.

This one didn't live up to the elevator pitch. Build chemical compounds out of elemental units, with some of them exploding violently if the players don't finish them fast enough? Sign me up!

Well, in practice it is more like Bingo. Draw some elements out of a bag, match them to a compound and score a few points. There is a little bit of a level-up system to make things more interesting, but even that is a little flat as it is pretty easy to switch stats back and forth as needed, removing any weight from choosing which path to build in the first place.

Also, the scoring seems more arbitrarily assigned than mathematically calculated. The elements you pull from the bag have a weighted rarity, so presumably if a compound contains rarer elements, it should be worth more points. It's not. The compounds score from 6-8 points, regardless of how difficult they are to complete. That point spread is simply not wide enough to account for the range of difficulty found in the compounds. It creates scores that are always artificially close and worse, there is no tie breaker in the rules. In other words, you get 45 minutes of a Bingo and a three-way tie score for your trouble. Yuck.

Oh dear, not for me. It just seems to be a game where you randomly gain elements to fulfil randomly drawn compounds, so inevitably it all ends up quiet close due to the law of averages.

Played at BGG Con 2015. Game was ok but not overly interesting. Which elements you draw is fairly random and the "trade among yourselves" mechanic always feels like something thrown in to make up for a random mechanic the designer couldn't quite figure out. You are fairly limited in your options and there didn't seem to be much of a way for players to differentiate their strategies so everyone had almost the same amount of points.

Very luck dependet, what you draw and finish in the beginning can highly influence the rest of the game. Too lucky for my taste, not a lot of decisions, the trading part wasn't game-changing since there aren't a lot of deals struck...

RATING: 7
I enjoy this game. The idea of a chemistry game scares some people off, but while the theme fits, you don't really need to know anything about chemistry to understand or enjoy the game. Players take turns playing out gems (elements) to complete compounds for varying amount of points and other bonuses. The game is a little confusing to explain, but it is easy to catch on during the game. 3/1/16

I've been looking for a trading game a bit less mathy than Chinatown and a bit more meaty than Bohnanza... Genoa didn't quite work out... and I'm not sure Compounded will either.  I like the flow of gaining resources, trading them, claiming goal cards and completing them. I also liked the ability improving experiments.  But I found the game broke down for me a bit with the fiddly seeming chemical reactions, equipment and particularly the lab fires.  I don't know what it is about those more rarely used parts of the rules but I kept not quite wrapping my head around them to the detriment of the group playing the game.  So... a solid trading game core here, but I'm sure about those extra elements.

This game was made by someone who clearly loves chemistry.  The problem with that is, their love of chemistry gets in the way of the game here.  They needed to abandon their quest for perfect chemical accuracy in pursuit of perfect game mechanics.

A loser, but if you want to teach a preteen or teen about some chemistry concepts, might be worth a look.  Of course, you could buy a couple of books about chemistry for the same price and they'd likely be more informative.

The Good: It's a really thinky game; getting the mancala to do what you want, budgeting appropriate time levels, figuring out how to milk each area to your advantage. The Bad: It's a bunch of mini-games bolted onto the core mancala action selection mechanism. Not a lot of theme connections in that regard. The Ugly: There is almost zero player interaction, if someone runs away with the game, you have to hope they screw up because coming back is woefully hard once that player figures out how the milk the mancala for what it's worth. Plays best at 4p as time management becomes more critical and the rest of the mini-games become more contested. I found I liked the game until I figured out what made it tick, then the shine wore off.

I love ancient Rome, and yes this game doesn't really have anything to do with ancient Rome thematically, but it's still amazing. The mancala mechanism is brilliant and really makes me think long and hard about every decision. It really forces you to think multiple turns ahead so you don't screw yourself. Every round and every game of this will have you deciding which part of the board you should focus on. They all generate points, but to find which combination at what time is the crux of the game.

One of Stefan Feld's best. It has typical Feldsy scoring at the end (VP potpourri) and the rotating cube mechanic is quite unique.

RATING: 8.5
If you are looking for a game which offers multiple ways to win and so many ways to score points so that you can apply different strategies, this is the game for you. It is a game that looks heavy but it is not (I am assuming you are a gamer and not a newbie). Wow. I would play over and over and every single game will always be different.

RATING: 9
Amazing, amazing, amazing. Almost sandboxy in the freedom of routes you can take but there's a gently mounting tension throughout due to the jostling for the particular spots / tiles you want, the fickle demands of the people and the constant march of time. You'll have one or two primary focus points yet you'll want to respond to the changing board position. And all this has to be filtered through the delicious Mancala action selection. Fast became my favourite Feld - not as breezy as Castles of Burgundy, but ultimately more satisfying.

RATING: 8
We got this because my wife and I, absolutely love The Castles of Burgundy. We were a bit overwhelmed the first time we played it, but already the second time we had it hit the table, most of the things just "clicked". We played  a full game in about 1½ hour, and that is just the right time for a game like this.

A bit heavier and meatier than Burgundy, but it has not yet surpassed it. Atleast not for me, but I think my wife like this more.

Played our 5th game with more than two, for the first time. We were 4. The two newcomers had not played it before. The game lenght was fine, and we had a good time, but I do enjoy it with two players more. For 4 players, it will only get a 7/10 by me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A victory points (VP) grabfest with a thin but pleasant enough Roman theme.

The game consists of 4 years, with each year consisting of 4 rounds, with a nice twist in that the length of a round is variable depending on the actions that players choose.  The core mechanic is unique (at least to me) in that you move clockwise and stepwise, action markers around a "rondel" of sorts and choose the action where you placed last with your action marker.  There are 6 different actions to choose from, and all of them are generally good although some are significantly better than others depending on the situation/your setup/end of game bonus cards etc.

After movement of action markers, you can potentially complete a bonus trajan tile (which awards points and a one-time ability bonus) if you've set yourself up/planned appropriately, then you get the one action you landed on.  Actions are: 1)military conquests, which have multiple options, but which can score points, 2) construction, which scores one-time points and either allows for big end game points or one-time immediate second action, 3) trajan tile selection, which can be used to replenish your "rondel" and thus score you more points and get you more benefits, 4) shipping, which is an opportunity to score big points by playing goods cards in one of 3 different possible combinations, 5) senate action, which scores points, and positions you for first choice at end of round bonus tiles, which can score big points at game end, and 6) forum, which is where you grab tiles such as votes for senate, requirements for the people, extra action bonuses.

At the end of a year, you need to satisfy the needs of the people or lose negative points (kind of like feeding your family in Agricola but not as punitive, and not as punitive as some other Feld games).  Again at end game, points are scored in addition to the points accumulated in game (the in-game points are very significant as well as the end-game ones).  Seems to scale very well (2-4 players), solid components, smooth and easy to play, but alot of options and difficult to determine which is the best one.  Definitely a solid euro gamers game.

[I]tl;dr - Have fun playing 12 mini games and adding up your points at the end.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Trajan is a brain-burning Feld game that's more boring than being at work. If you want a game where you're struggling against the design for the entire game, and all of the disparate elements feel totally disconnected, this is the game for you. Though I pursued a strong military strategy, I was destroyed in the Forum and finished almost forty points behind my father-in-law.

Ultimately, I felt like I was playing 12 different mini-games rather than a single cohesive whole. If you want to keep balanced in your head the relative strengths of each little mini-game and relatively how much of each you should pursue based on what your opponents are doing, Trajan may be the game for you. 

One piece of praise: the rondel element was extremely thought-provoking, but one of the best parts of the game -- I'd love to see that rondel mechanic spun off into its own game. I'm not sure what that would look like, but the actual action-selection in Trajan was quite interesting. 

Recommended if point salad is your thing, I guess. Can I damn with faint praise? I don't think Trajan is a good game.

Potential future 10 if I like it on replays. Am I good at this game? No, not yet. However, it's by far my favorite Feld (comparing to Bora Bora & Amerigo). For all the complexity of this game having so many actions, all the actions have logical, easy-to-remember rules. It's definitely a heavy, complex game that rewards a mix of strategy & tactics. You have to consider long term strategies but also seize opportunities. In my opinion, this is the most thematic Feld I've played. You are a top-ranking politician in an empire and there's always so much you want to do and always either no time to do it (those round tracks flow by so quickly!) or no opportunity to do it (if you haven't counted out the mancala properly by planning in advance). There are so many objectives and completing one often means sacrificing the other. Do you meet the people's demands? Well, that'll cost a turn, and you could use that turn to ship goods. Or you could use that turn to place your legions and gain power over an area. Or you might build, and if you don't build now, another politician may occupy that area before you get to it. But wait - who is trying to win leadership in the senate? Oh if only you could get that forum tile to buy some votes, you could get that valuable end-game scoring tile... and so on. Trajan is a game of scarcity. You want to do a great deal, you have to do multiple things to survive, but you also can't run around doing everything and accomplishing nothing. You would think it would cause AP, but due to the limiting nature of the mancala, decisions are actually quite easy to make. Normally, by the time your turn comes around, you're ready to go. For a game that takes 2+ hours for 4 players, it actually moves quite swiftly. It is a hard game to teach because of the large amount of actions and the mancala mechanic (I'd recommend Five Tribes as a simpler precursor to teach players that mechanic first),  but it is definitely worth the effort. A fair warning that the rulebook is painfully dry and exhausting to read, but once you get past that, there is an excellent game here.

6/7/2017 - played again, updating to a 10. Originally, we made several rule mistakes and getting those rules right has made the game even better (the three rules was taking a bonus action when taking the first construction tile of a type, that trajan tiles go under the arch, and that playing to the display allows you to redraw cards). The systems are designed to work together in perfect, brutal harmony. A masterpiece of a game that is rich in depth and yet by some miracle completely enjoyable by absolutely new players (because everything is designed to avoid causing AP). Given how much better the game is with those rules played right (especially the construction action allowing for mandala mitigation), I just have to raise my rating to 10. Absolutely love this game.

6/21/17 - Played again. Yes, definitely a 10.

I found this another bulky design by Feld. This is set-collection in a variety of different forms with no thematic integration. It looks lovely, works well, and is nicely strategic, but sometimes less is more. This game is not as unwieldy as Bora Bora, but it is not as streamlined as Notre Dame, In the Year of the Dragon, Castles of Burgundy, or Rialto. The Mancala mechanic is fabulous - why Feld feels the need to throw so many eggs into one basket is beyond me though - a simpler use of the Mancala/Rondel system would have kept me much happier. Luna is still number-one Feld for me, which is kind of a shame because it's the least obviously "Feldian". Still, if you enjoy his other games, Trajan is a sure-fire hit.

In term of excitedness level between the 3 Felds, I would be more excited to play Trajan because during the endgame, you feel like you've achieved something, seeing your meeples on the mainboard & planning for the next game, maybe expanding military territory, or building more civil structures, or shipping more goods besides getting favors from the citizens and collecting Trajan or forum tiles. Second would be Bora Bora because lots of stuff to do and the visual is amazing including the player reference. And third is Burgundy with its simple gameplay and enough decision making to do.

LIKE: Great mancala use, managing the limited colors and thinking ahead to the next action or two, AND managing bonus actions. I really enjoyed how the different strategies evolved over the course of the game, and how players have opportunities to interfere with one another.

DISLIKE: The different areas on the board are a little disparate and don't merge together intuitively. In my opinion, this accentuates the point salad element in a negative way. Also, the shipping cards are very random and it doesn't seem that the game moves through the deck quickly enough to mitigate its randomness.

OVERALL: A very good game, lots to enjoy. Some mild similarities to Oracle of Delphi. The manacala is a brain burner, delightfully so, but not sure how often I would play this.

RATING: 9
Probably my favourite Feld at the moment.  It gets a slight nod over Castles of Burgundy since I think it has a bit more replayability.

I find each of the six mini-games uninteresting on their own, but somehow them + the mancala mechanic makes for a very fun game.

RATING: 6.5
Trajan isn't a great game. At least, that's my first impression. I do like it well enough - and I want to play it more. But my take away is the Mancala mechanism is surprisingly complicated for little result. It turns out there's only one purpose for the colors and that's to get the bonus Trajan tiles (appropriately the name of the game). Yes, those are great and they add a different angle on the game. But it seems overly complex to have that result of what is nearly just a free turn. So there's a frustration to this central mechanic that overshadows the fun for me. Then around this mechanic are what many now call victory point salad. That's alright for me - it keeps you thinking and always puts out a reward. But over all, Trajan just isn't blowing me away. I am glad that is plays at all given that I'm color-blind!

More is not always better, I could say. In the heart of Trajan is an action selection rondel mechanic, which is a neat solution for everyone who like to plan ahead and phase their actions. So this should be a game for me since I like phasing. 

However, in Trajan things have been taken a step or two too far. You're not only setting up for your next couple of actions but almost the whole game. You are not creating combos but piping your actions into certain order. I reckon, this is mainly because the situation on the board via player interaction changes too slowly to keep the planning horizon from stretching 6-7 rounds to the future. Personally, I think this is just too much. Oh, I do adore games that leave room for long term strategies but it is not the same thing as planning all your moves beforehand.

This pre-planning creates a problem: You definitely do not want to mess your carefully planned sequence of actions but sometimes the tactical situation might require something else. Often a single miscalculated step puts you off the track and you will spend several turns to get back on it. In a brutal game like Trajan, this usually equals to giving up the fight for the win. So what happens is that everyone will just concentrate on their own rondel and player interaction will become even less. Solitairish games are usually not a problem but Trajan is all about being first in whatever you do.

There are a lot of good qualities to this game and I can see why it is highly rated. It just did not hit the sweetspot for me who likes pondering the subtler consequences of my actions instead of leaping from one cliff to another with no margin for error. But at least you have meaningful decisions to make throughout the whole game.

One more good thing is how you get points from almost everything you do. Some people criticize Feld games for this, i.e., being VP salads but I quite fancy it. Those single VPs you get from myriad of things do not win you the game. They are just consolidation prizes giving you a feeling that you achieved something. You do not need to perform a ten move sequence to score points but managing nine moves is already rewarding.

Another game that is very deceiving in appearance.  Looks very complex, but in reality every bit is manageable and fairly simple.  It's like a game made up of several playable mini games.  Far more fun than any of us expected, and far easier to learn than we imagined.

A good game, but fails to reach greatness in my mind.  The mancala mechanic is interesting, but most of the time the color of the markers in the mancala doesn't matter.  The goal tiles aren't that interesting or varied.  The restriction on where you can place the Trajan tiles on your board feels overly restrictive.

I enjoy the game, but wouldn't rank it as one of Feld's best.

A really good Stefan Feld my wife will play. It is a solid euro and true to many of Feld's games it is a points salad with a collection of many complimentary and interesting mechanisms some of which stand out as unique or at least uncommon with a novel twist. The strength of the play experience outweighs artistic and thematic deficiencies. Definitely worth owning and always worth a play.

Stefan Feld master piece. A unique game like no other.  A mancala type mechanism to determine actions and collect bonuses + worker placement to collect tiles, tiles sets, bonuses and victory points + a card hand management sub-system(seaport action) to meld commodities and collect victory points... this game simply has every single thing a gamer would desire in a game. Sounds complex, but it's really not.

Smooth, fun, a bit thinky but not too much - yes, point salad, but there is a lot of tactic and a bit of strategy. I haven't played too much Feld, but this is fine. Still, it's not the sort of game I would want to play every week, so, I assume I could just keep playing this rather than chase down other Feld games. 
Oh, and I feel the Mancala mechanism totally breaks the Roman theme. But hey.

RATING: 8.95
Abstract:
A heavy euro optimization game by Stefan Feld where each player has his own game board with a Mancala (rondel wheel) to activate one of six sub-systems and potential bonus actions (Trajan tiles).

Possible actions:
a) Forum: select a forum tile (get an update tile to increase the number of actions)
b) Senate: gain senate vote (get victory points, choose end game bonus tile on majority)
c) Construction: construct buildings (set-collection + cut-off other players "snake"-like)
d) Military: conquer a province (area control, collect bonus tiles)
e) Shipping: gain good card or ship resources (set-collection, race-game)
f) Trajan: gain a Trajan tile (placed on the Mancala to trigger additional actions)

Pros:
+ Innovative use of Mancala which is all about efficiency and planning 
+ Player interaction is indirect and depends on the particular sub-game: area-control, race for collecting tiles first, snatching away good tiles to avoid penalties caused by demands
+ Wide variety of options that feel different (high replayability)
+ Rules are good (could be more explicit: Trajan tiles satisfy demands only after being activated, player order never changes, and time tracker is not reset after a round)
+ Length of a round is determined how players use their Mancala
+ Good mix between tactical and strategical decision-making, however, strategical players will be higher rewarded
+ Plays well with all player counts (2-player is less competitive, because their is more space/tiles available)

Neutrals:
# Nearly no luck: demand tiles are randomly revealed and players can choose different ways how to draw new good cards
# Good cards and forum tiles are revealed in different order but there are no different elements or abilities per game
# No hidden information
# Scoring happens during the round, between rounds, and at the end of the game

Cons:
- Overwhelming on first play: many options and mechanics is not for everyone
- Fiddly: lots of tiles
- Long set-up due to lot of tiles (Trajan tiles need to be sorted)
- Can be solitaire - if you consider what others do, it will get complex (analysis paralysis)
- Theme is okay, but dry and not very strong
- Hard to teach: a lot of different systems
- No player aid

Thoughts:
Trajan is about planing and puzzling to be most efficient and sometimes being ahead of someone else. I like the intertwined sub-games most. The Mancala drives the game and makes it unique. So far, the Mancala intimidates me into planing at least five or more turns ahead.

Similar games: 
* Bora Bora (complexity-wise, similar number of mechanics and tiles)

Player: 2-4 (best: 3-4) | Time: 60-120m

A strong game by Stefen Feld, who is excellent at making games that I really love for about 5-10 plays.  The Mancala-like action mechanic is very interesting and mind blowing for a few plays.

A never ending game of mankala with columns of differing colors. Worse part of it is playing it solo. No one really cared what each other was doing. Maybe some part of the game we would be concentrating on 'getting there first.'

But as it dragged on, no one bothers, as even if you did, you will just be slowing down the leader to let the others catch up. In which, you will go further down.

Move to A to get B for VP type of game again. Worst, is that never ending cycle to want to go A,but you need to go 2 rounds before you come back to A. Thus the game drops down to moving only 1-2 peg, just to repeat what we need to do. A more frustrated version of worker placement game, except, that you can't really place it. Rodel in a different format. Afraid nothing really genius about it.

Dry as saltines, like most Field games. Definitely better than some of his others for me. Planning for combos on the mancala player board is interesting enough. But I'm trying to figure out if there are enough competitive routes to victory. 

My experience was grossly weighted towards senate / shipping combos and collecting sets of the builder (right term?) tokens. Can military or trade heavy strategies compete? Or is that it?

Like any Feld game, the actions themselves have little depth. It's take a step, claim a tile, or move a token on a track. Woohoo. If the game was abstracted to 4 tracks with status markers moving up W/the mancala combos and cards on top, it would be virtually the exact same game.

Very mature title, perhaps the most mature (i.e. robust, meaty) I've played from Feld. 

Ironically, most of the game is relatively simplistic to unremarkable, but the mancala helps elevate Trajan beyond merely being the sum of its parts. No, there is a special kind of magic as you navigate the wealth of options available to you every round. 

Update (11/21/14): Raised this to a 9 after several more plays. This game is soooo damn good; the balance between short and long term achievements is fairly remarkable. Wheels within wheels -- this game is a strategically fractal. :)

It might be a bit much, actually, but I still enjoyed it. There are a lot of things going on, and they each have a different way in which they operate and give you points. It's a very Feld-ian mishmash of mechanisms, and there are so many ways to score points. Still, managing the rondel is an interesting exercise.

My favorite game. Ingenious mechanism for making moves. Lots of options for actions with several good victory strategies. Very replayable. 2 minor negatives are that: 1. I don't think it works as well for 4 players - too slow, too long and there are less options for moves due to the board getting congested and potentially running out of some trajan tiles, and 2. there can be too much first player advantage if a player gets a doubler with a forum bonus. Excellent to play online at boiteajeux.net.

Great game. Mr Feld has done it again. Its a medium-weight eurogame with a lot of ways to score victory points. You can make short-term as well as long-term plans. The mancala mechanic is awesome. A lot of things going on, so many options. Nice high quality components. The game takes 2-2,5 hours for 4 players but it is not as brain-burning as it seems. kinda like Castles of Burgundy in this aspect. The theme is pasted-on, it's just a cover for this fascinating game engine.

RATING: 8.5
Very nice game, feels similar to Castles of Burgundy (my first game by this designer) in that you're collecting a bunch of nuggets. This game is a bit meaner in that you can lose points in a number of ways and there are several sections where a player can be completely locked out. The Mancala thing is incredibly incredibly intricate, but with so much future-decision-making involved that it's hard to really take it into account a lot of the time. I think I like CoB better because it's slightly less fiddly, but both games are excellent (if practically themeless).

EDIT: I lied, I like this more.

Nice mechanisms, especially the mancala action selection. On my first play, it felt pretty long and I knew I was out of contention pretty early on, which meant it dragged a little. But Id certainly play again and hope to do better, investing in +2s and more Trajan tiles to make my actions more efficient.

This is the most glorious and well-designed point salad I've ever played. Some Feld games have been "meh" for me, but Trajan is stupendous! Negative points come from your failure as a Roman aristocrat and governor to meet the demands of the populace. The mancala wheel already demonstrates the difficulty of any leader to keep a handle on bureaucracy, and the fact that your personal goals and ambitions may clash with or ignore the very people for whom your democratic republic is founded is quite interesting.

Probably Feld's most interesting point salad, with a little more theme than his other games too (although much of it is created in the theater of the mind).  Great integration of various mechanics, and really rewards a well thought out strategy.  I would say this is the heaviest euro on my shelf and sometimes I feel like tossing it in the air mid-game, which is the mark of a truly top tier experience in my opinion!

I am beginning to see a pattern here with Feld games:  lots of quirky and interesting mechanics very capably put together, with lots of different paths to victory to explore on multiple plays, and...virtually no real theme, or sense of thematic play, very little direct player interaction, and very rudimentary, ho-hum spatial elements and challenges.  

Trajan may very well be the pinnacle of this Feld style, but for me, curiously, after really admiring Macao and Castles for this Feld style, with Trajan, it feels like it is beginning to wear thin and appear inadequate from a game design perspective.  Where is the player interaction in this game?  Where is an actual theme?  Is it asking too much to play a game where you feel like you are thematically doing something other than trying to cleverly produce victory points using clever mechanics?  (For what it's worth, I think Feld's Luna fares better on theme, player interaction, and interesting spatial aspects.) 

And as much as I admire Feld's use of a circular mancala mechanic here in Trajan, for me, it really continually underscored that this is a game, devoid of theme, where 75% of your playing time is spent trying to manage your game of solitaire, going around in circles all game.  In truth, I guess I don't care for games where the dynamo, the driver of the game, is a process of going around in circles (eg rondelles).  Why am I staring at a small "solitaire defined" circle for 2 hours?  

So Trajan is definitely a challenging and interesting game.  Fun for dedicated gamers for sure.  But ultimately, Trajan was so thin thematically, it felt to me like much ado about nothing, absolutely nothing.  Giving it a 7.  April 2012.

No desire to play this again, so giving it a 6.  October 2014.

I tend to think of "point salad" as a disparaging term, and Trajan is as point-salady as they come. It's essentially a set of 6 areas (mini-games) tied together by a mancala that controls which of the areas you can take actions in. But Feld knows how to make a truly compelling game out of it. Key to what makes the game interesting is the variable set-up and the variable set of demands and bonus tiles that come out each turn. These, combined with what your opponents are doing and the disposition of cubes on the mancala, dictate your strategy which can be quite different from game to game. While the game doesn't exactly drip theme, each of the areas makes sense thematically.

Mancala on steroids.

Great game and I love the integration of getting "trajans" with tactical use of "mancala" tokens.  The mechanism to control the pace of the game via the mancala tokens used is pure genius.

Although the game seems to flow nicely together, some of the thematic element seem tacked on such as the forum and military conquering.

After thinking about it a bit, I decided that the Mancala mechanic - in terms of control, as opposed to the tile-buying bits which I found pretty cool - is just a crappy version of a Rondel.  It is possible to pre-plan, and I found it reasonably satisfying to have 3-turn executions go off, but overall I had a lot of "ugh...I have 4 ways to ship?" type decisions.  I also feel like the game is almost like a minigame mediator: little wargame up top, little set collection game on the left, etc.  Not that I feel the "minigames" are independently fun, but I think the variety of actions is decent.  Overall, it just didn't grip me, and I mostly blame what I presume to be the game's major point: the action selection mechanic.

RATING: 8.5
Trajan plays like a well developed Feld game.  Feld has acquired quite a talent in putting together games that comprise mini-games in which several actions interact with each other.  This leads some to see the game as more complex - and it does suffer from a long time to explain the game - that in the end is rarely seen in actual game play.  The choices on a given turn are limited and aid the pace of the game.  The game's overall length is meaty without over staying its welcome.  If games that require players to dabble in multiple areas simultaneously appeal, then this game is a definite to try.  Solid Feld design and easily ranks with his other top-rated games.

A staggering game, really, it seems quite heavy at first but it's really just the overwhelming amount of options you have, means of acquiring victory points (in Feldian fashion). Conquest, construction, Senate votes, shipping commodities, he's thought of just about everything it takes to control and Empire. The design is meticulous and what I love about this is that I constantly feel as if I'm actively thinking about what course to take out on the main board, while controlling my mancala and tile placement. The game may look dry, but it's anything but. One of the best Euros in my collection. Loaded.

Probably my least favorite Feld. I get why people think it is awesome, but I really didn't enjoy the mancala mechanism. I think it is as simple as that. I appreciate the design and would be more than willing to play it again if the group wanted to, but I am not excited about the prospect.

A really great game with a ton of routes to victory. What I like best is you are definitely encouraged to do what others are not and take what you're left, and that's my type of game.

However, I'll probably never own it because the random elements are a little higher than what I typically like. With random cards and randomly assigned tiles if you want to invest in, say, shipping you're going to need to get a lot of luck.

RATING: 7
This is a Stephan Feld point-salad euro. If you have played any of his previous titles, you probably have a general idea about how this game plays. But honestly, this may be his strongest point-salad. First, you have this mancala mechanism that creates some intensely brain-burning decisions, especially as players attempt to not only do specific actions but to activate Trajan/Bonus tiles at the same time. Combined that with 6-different actions, which are mini-games in themselves, and tons of concrete information, the decisions/possibilities seem endless. And if you somehow manage to comprehend the mancala mechanism quickly, you can recognize what other players are doing and potentially manipulate the speed of the game to hinder their progress. And finally, the game manages to support a wide range of tactical and strategic decisions. 

Ultimately, this is a point-salad game on crack. If you like Feld's designs, this is the one you should work up to.

I finally got this to the table, and I must say it's a great game. It has all the elements of a good Feld game: tension, rather short turns, and that great quality of having just a handful of possible actions, but having a hard time making the choice.

The minigames it's composed of are very fun, and the Mancala mechanic feels really fresh and innovative, as well.

I might even raise its rating in the future, after further plays.

UPDATE: It's starting to feel a bit less interesting now that I've played several times at Boiteajeux. I still need to bring it back to the table, but for now, it's down to an 8.

In Trajan players are attempting to earn glory by helping to expand Rome's power and influence.  Despite frequent criticisms to the contrary, I quite like the way this game handles its theme.  While I wouldn't call it a "thematic game" like Descent or Spartacus, I would say it's on par with something like Tigris and Euphrates (which I also think is thematically strong).

Players must influence the powerful factions and families in rome (represented buy colored wood on their mancala) to create coalitions that result in some sort of action - trading, influence in the senate, rebuilding roman neighborhoods, or conquests in the frontier.

Like many games of this era (particularly Feld's games) you get points in lots of different ways.  Each turn feels productive and gives the player a lot of choice in how to proceed. 

Manipulating the mancala is very clever and very interesting, and the beating heart of this game.  

Note: all my plays of this are 2 player -- my wife and I love it!

Jelenleg úgy tűnik, hogy ez a játék lesz (lett) a 2011-es esseni felhozatalból a 2. legnagyobb durranás, ehhez képest nekem kicsit csalódás. Talán túl sokat vártam az értékelések miatt, meg Feld miatt, de annak ellenére nem éreztem elég ütősnek, hogy sok minden tetszik benne. El tudom képzelni, hogy másodjára nagyon bejön majd, de elsőre elmaradt a katarzis...

A játék Feld többi játékához képest bonyolult, sokkal több tényezős, nehezebben tervezhető, a rengeteg lehetőség közt szinte el lehet veszni, de eredeti ötletben számomra a Macao vagy a Notre Dame többet adott. Persze pozitívumnak is felfogható a rengeteg lehetőség (számtalan győzelmi út kínálkozik, nem érzem, hogy lenne egy tuti), de talán az illik erre a játékra, hogy "a kevesebb néha több". Már a szabály olvasásánál is felmerült bennem, hogy jóég mennyi lapka, van a bónusz, meg a bónusznak a bónusza... Játék közben ez nem tűnik ijesztőnek, mégis túl sok kicsit. A mancala-rondella nem rossz, bár az is felfogható egy külön játéknak szinte, főleg hogy a kör végére és bizonyos lapkákra is figyelni kell. Egyébként a Burgundhoz hasonlóan általában a jó és a még jobb közül lehet választani, tehát ha valaki ész nélkül hajtja végre az akciókat, annak is lesz sikerélménye, de egy kis fifikával egész durva kombók is szerezhetők (pl. a +2 akció nagyon sokat tud tejelni).
A körszámláló tetszik, és a játékosok külön tábláin nagyon jó az elrendezés, és általában véve is szép a játék!
Összességében jó, de mégis kicsit többet vártam a szerző legbonyolultabb játékától, kicsit öncélúnak érzem a sok-sok lehetőség felhalmozását, a kreativitás helyett  optimalizálási magasiskolát kaptunk...
A Burgund-dal egy szintre tettem pontszámban, a Notre Dame és a Macao mögé... A Dragonosnál viszont szerintem jobb, annak ellenére, hogy az sokkal egyedibb.
Hossza: a játékosonként fél óra nekünk nem jött be, 2 fős játék volt másfél óra, de még új volt a játék...
---
Na megvolt egy 3 fős is, kb. ugyanazt adta játékélményben, mint a 2 fős, csak kicsit hosszabban. Néhány dolgon azért jobban érződik így a szűkösség (pl. építés). Most már körvonalazódnak azok a részek, amikre mindenképp érdemes áldozni (+2 lapkák, építkezés), de még mindig úgy érzem, hogy nagyon sok módon lehet nyerni.
---
3 parti alapján úgy érzem, hogy az építés túl erős akció. A kártyás részhez kapcsolódó bónuszok pedig gyengék (kevés a 3 pont/lap). Tisztán a harci rész se túl erős. A politikai résszel talán lehet kezdeni valamit, de még nem próbáltuk ki, tisztán mennyit hozna (2+3+4+5+... azért ez elég biztató sor).
---
Számolgattam kicsit, ezek alapján az jött ki, hogy ha tisztán egy akciótípusra rámegy valaki, akkor egyértelműen a politikai akció a legerősebb (a legtöbb pontot adja, és más nem tud benne megakadályozni!!). A következő legjobb az építés, utána a trajan lapkák, majd a hajó, végül a leggyengébb a tisztán katonai akció. Önmagában a fórum akció nem jó semmire, csak töltelék akciónak jó. Mit értek tiszta stratégián? Kb. az akciók 2/3-a lehet egyféle akció, ügyes mancalázással. Egy játékban  átlagosan 28-29 akciónk van alapból (a plusz akciók ezen felül jönnek), tehát 20 azonos típusú akcióval nyugodtan lehet számolni, ha valaki egy típusra megy rá.
A játékban egyébként nagyon eltérő lehet a körök száma, nagyjából 20 a minimum és 50 a maximum körszám, játékosszámtól függően +-1.
---
Na leteszteltem élesben a szenátusi akciót, úgy, hogy az ellenfelekkel közöltem előre, hogy azt fogom csinálni: 124 pontot szereztem csak ezzel (a max. lehetséges 140-ből)... Szerintem egyértelmű, hogy ez a nyerő, sajnos ez meg is öli a játékot. Ha az ellenfelek összebeszélnek és csak arra mennek, hogy elszedjék a szenátusi akció duplázó lapkákat (azt hiszem, 3 van alapból + 2 jóker), akkor is 1-2-t szinte biztosan megszerzek, így a 100 pont elérése 99%, és ez csak a szenátusi akcióból. Ezen kívül 30-40 pont simán összekaparható, azokkal az akciókkal, amik szükség szerűen nem lehetnek szenátus akciók (kb. az akciók 1/3-a). Ráadásul a szenátusban bónuszlapkák is szerezhetők, amik szintén adnak pontokat... Mivel a többi akciótípusban a pontszerzésünk mástól is függ, ezért szerintem ha valaki nem a szerencsére és mások jóindulatára akarja bízni az eredményt, akkor a politikai akcióra megy rá, így a vége az lesz, hogy mindenki arra megy, és a legügyesebb mancalás nyer. Ha valaki nem a politikaira megy, azt a többiek simán meg tudják akadályozni az 1/3 maradék akciójukkal abban, hogy magas pontja legyen.

Még egy hiba: a térképen eddig minden játékban megszívta valaki a jobb oldali 2 tartomány közti átjárhatóság hiányát: ez elég illúzióromboló megoldás.
---
Jelenleg 4 Feld játék azonos pontszámon áll nálam, nem tudok dönteni közülük:)
---
Lepontoztam a Bora bora pontszámára, mert kb. azonos élményt adtak, és a régebbi Feldek azért kicsit jobban tetszenek. 
Átpontoztam a Feldeket, csak 3 db 8 pontost hagytam: Burgund, Dragon, Notre Dame. A Burgundba nem nagyon tudok belekötni, de a másik kettő az, amivel legszívesebben játszom.

A collection of mini games very well tied together. An abstract mechanic defines the balance between your actions. There are many ways to score and there are some ways to produce more actions, a bit like Burgen. It is a good game, I was fascinated at first but then I wished for a more immediate way of choosing my actions rather than the abstract rondel. The game's strategy is mainly choosing which action benefits you most at the time, but there are also some long term benefits that you can tie in to your style of play. I was only frustrated by the rondel and just a bit. The game itself is great.

Stefan Feld is the genius of the unusual mechanics, and I am always fascinated by his designs.
The mancala-like action selection mechanic is at the same time brilliant, frustrating, absolutely theme-unrelated (although Trajan has some theme) and mind-boggling!
If I'd have to define it using a figure of speech, I'd say it feels like a spider's web: everytime you touch a thread somewhere, everything else will move accordingly...
I love it.
Of course, when you play Trajan you feel you're playing against the game more than versus the opponents: the sheer quantity of different permutations is too much to handle (of course after some plays this feeling vanishes, but I am not so sure...), so the game seems more a solitaire puzzle with the occasional getting in the way of another player. I absolutely need more plays to see if it cand stand multiple plays, and if the player interaction increases when the intricacies of the game become a second nature and players can better read what the opponents might do.

06/12 - Masterpiece. The mancala/rondel mechanic is outstanding, and this game screams Feld! I appreciate the implemintation of theme, but not everyone will. Currently my favorite game.

10/12 - after 24 plays of this game, it has not gotten old at all! I had 'figured out' the game pretty early on (play one or two) but I really feel like an expert when playing now. Myself and my main Trajan partner, David, usually get a minimum of 30 end of the game scoring points and as of the past three to four 2 player games, have been scoring more than 150 a game. 

7/14 - At this point, I've played 40 times. Oh my goodness does this game continue to offer amazing gameplay or what?! It's our go-to game with 2-3, and as we play 2 player games of Trajan in 35 minutes, we can play it whenever!

The Mancala system is interesting.  However, I fear that the commodities break the game in a similar fashion to the Expedition cards in Goa.  Keep in mind that I've only played it once.

Update:  As I suspected the commodities can really break the game.  During my 2nd time playing I randomly drew 3 of the same commodity type during the starting setup!  There are 12 different types and 5 cards per type.  I realize the odds of this happening is crazy, but it did happen.  I still enjoy the game.

Favorite Feld game thus far.  Played just once, but the impression was good enough to impel me to buy it off of Thor at gamesurplus.com - and I even ordered a second copy for a friend who also wanted it.  All the pretty bits and pieces, plus the mancala mechanism come together to make a fun game with a bunch of choices.  We did play the trajan tile completion thing wrong, but oh well.  Learning game.  

*UPDATE* Still likes it a lot - my pwecioussssss.  Bwahah.  Also traded a backup copy for Lancaster w/ The New Laws (thanks, chaddyboy!)

Like many Feld games there is a central mechanism and several mini games and I really do like the mancala as a mechanism although not sure the way it is explored here is mega interesting, just a nice flavoring.  Still making sense of some of the mini games but none of them seem that interesting in of themselves but they do blend together nicely.  I quite like the unpredictableness that comes with Amerigo and Castles that comes from the luck which is missing here.  Still a very fun game and I think it will be one I like more with each extra play.

A deep game that has a real learning curve. To win the game, you will have to hold your strategy and to be opportunistic to recover bonus tiles that everyone covets.

The action system, created from the awalé is original and not easy to master. It can even be frustrating to see that in a round our choice of action will be limited to a single choice.

The 30 min games by players announced are respected and we do not see the time passing.

The only negative point is that the interaction is limited to taking a tile faster than the opponents.

Essen 2011: First Play: I had digested the rules but still needed to be methodical to explain as we were all first timers. The game is a head -f**k. So many prefered options but unable to do most, the first quarter of the game is spent plodding through the actions. Slowly the penny drops and this is a beast of a game. So inovative and so clever. We all wanted to play again.

Second play. The options are clearer but still a real puzzle to line your preferences up. A classic.

One of the top games of 2011 for me.

This one's an 8 but only because I don't believe in half-ratings and it's not quite a 7. The mancala mechanic here is phenomenal, but almost *too* controlling, I find? It otherwise unifies six decent distinct mini-games into one bigger game, though with the theme I would have liked to see more player conflict.

RATING: 7.5
I've currently only played this using a solo variant that mimics a 2p game but it works well. After multiple plays with it, I so far really enjoy Trajan. The big selling point is the mancala mechanic that determines what actions you can take and if you get any Trajan bonuses. Trying to take actions while also setting yourself up for future actions is a great puzzle. The "mini games" on the board that correspond to every action I find work pretty well and really cause to me think about what to focus on each game. After only playing CoB and Trajan from Mr. Feld, this is my favorite between those two. They both are point-salad puzzly games but this one is a bit heavier which I prefer. It's also longer to play so playing with 3 or 4 players may change how I feel for better or for worse.

Except for the novel mancala action selection system this game has nothing new to offer. It's just take an action to get points repeated ad infinitum. We've seen this before. And when the only novel thing in a game is interesting but not necessarily good the game seems a lost cause. The mancala wheel just adds a lot of AP to the game and really bogs it down. For me this is far more important than the interesting decisions it offers. So nice try but no cigar.

The innovative Mancala mechanic, the plethora of paths for victory points, the speed of the game based on how far you move on the mancala and the immense replayability with the different tiles makes this a must have for any Feld fan. A little weak on theme, but it's what we've been accustomed to with this designer. Good stuff!

RATING: 7
Feels like Feld's best and most complete design.  There are many aspects to balance.  I played it with two, but would really like to try it with 3 or 4 to see how it goes.  Overall, other than conflict with the military and construction parts of the board, it feels like the game would pretty much play the same.  A lot of danger for AP and, if players play too fast, getting stuck with colored pieces in the wrong places on your board.

Tried this again with 3 players this time and that felt like a sweet spot for the game.  All of us played quickly and the game was a lot of fun.  It had been 9 months since my first play, but I was much more competent in putting together a strategy this time.  It's a quality, pretty themeless (it is Feld) game.

Played again with 4 players and it was good, but not great.  I'm definitely losing interest in the point salads from Feld.  They are still okay, but not great.  The mancala mechanic in this game is neat, but the point for everything in this game is a bit over the top... even for Feld.

A fantastic game. Offers a great push and pull on your actions with the mancala mechanism as you attempt to persue a coherent strategy, all the time evaluating and re-evaluating how you hope to achieve your goals. I wouldn't call it themeless, although the theme is unimportant to it's design and it doesn't really give flavourful feedback. Really hits the sweet spot between tactics and strategy, at least for myself.

Pro's.

1) The mancala and how it combines with your actions is very compelling, using it to then maximize your board actions feels great when you achieve your goals.
2) Variety of choice and how to maximize your points gain. It is often difficult to decide what is the best option yet your choice never feels invalid.
3) There is really something special about getting that 3 - 4 times action repeat combo. Managing to acquire and ship goods for many points or completing those Trajan tiles or sending out your military on campaign.
4) Very well balanced for multiple player counts.

Con's:

1) The game is not thematic, but at the same time, I'm very thankful for the little theme that is actually there.
2) Sometimes it seems like it is better to get easy points then to plan for a grand combo. Particularly if you have to prevent the negative points for not fulfilling the people's demands. This can then derail your entire super combo plan as it destroys the mancala you may have been planning for.

the rules not convinced me from the beginning, but I wanted to give a chance to this game since the author .. but I must say that although it is thought well, it's so boring! each playing his game trying to do anything that makes accumulating points, the actions have no meaning and are not related to the game itself. I do not understand how he can get the votes so high. I was really disappointed

Rating after one play with two players. I liked it, but had very hopes for the game and it didn't meet my expectations. This can in part be due to that the game is better with more players.

Looking forward to more plays, definitely, and I just hope that the game will improve.

Looked like a big, heavy game but actually ended up feeling like a much more tactical, opportunistic game - even with a slight element of chaos.

The Mancala mechanism is nice in that it rewards good planning and provides a limit on the actions you can perform, meaning you have some idea of what your opponents can and cant do.

Certainly looking forward to playing again.

Got to play this one.  Very Feldian.  Lots of ways to score points and with the Manacala mechanic (which is awesome by the way) it makes it feel different.  I also enjoy the fact that the players can push the tempo.  Lots of moving parts in this one (and all seem fairly balanced).  Rules wise, once you get through them, it's pretty simple.  There is also some future planning in this and the room to be creative.  

Need to play more and I'm sure my rating will go up as I am a Feld fan and can tell I'm going to enjoy this one. Where it goes up to?  I don't know.  That remains to be seen. 

Oh yeah, theme?  Naaah.  Really not here but that doesn't bother me.  The little bit it has along with the game play is perfect.  I probably lean more towards abstracts, anyways.

It's Macao redux and I mean that in the worst possible way.  Another game where Feld restricts your actions with some kind of gimmicky, arcane wheel combined with a bunch of non-interacting disparate game systems.  And of course there is a penalty for not doing something.  His games are so trite and predictable at this point.

I really must stress that the entire game is manipulating the stupid action wheel.  Everyone's heads are down all the time studying their wheel and trying to get it to do what they want.  Player interaction is minimal and since the actions don't really affect each other, there is not much strategy.

Don't buy the hype, there are better dry mechanical Euros like the recently released Tzolkin that provide a more interesting puzzle.

An interesting game, lots going on, lots of ways to score points (typical Stefan Feld)... if you don't mind moderately complex games, it offers many choices and a lot to think about on any given turn, but gradually you develop a clear path to maximizing your own victory points.

I've enjoyed this game each time I've played, and the more I play the better it becomes as the strategies start to emerge a bit more clearly. Players need to balance their influence across a number of spheres, and time their actions to get the most benefit. The 'mancala' style action selection mechanism is clever and more than just a gimmick - more forgiving and more flexible than a rondel, but can still leave you unable to do the action you need most unless you sequence your actions quite carefully. This makes for quite a tense game. Good solid euro, not outstanding but happy to play this one.

Only one play so far...

Trajan suffers from one major drawback that makes me not necessarily want to play it again - a lack of connection between the gameplay and the theme.  The gameplay itself has multiple mechanisms being crammed together for almost no reason whatsoever except to make the game strategic.  That works in abstract games for me, but not so much in non-abstracts.

However, the actual game strategies are there and it wins points for that.  I just miss the mechanics to theme connection.

Best game of the games i played during and after the game fair in 2011. The move mechanism is a dream and sometimes creates a lot of work for your brain. Chess players must here be better, because they can think 3,4 or 5 turns forward. A tiny chance of luck when drawing the goods cards from the deck, and you already got the fitting Senat bonus chit in front of you.

RATING: 10
Long rules explanation and setup time, but once you start playing the game flows beautifully.  Fast turns and the game plays more quickly than you would think.  The mancala and Trajan tiles mechanic is awesome and keeps the game from feeling like an optimization problem.  Lots of ways to get points and all are fun and seem to be pretty balanced so you feel like you have a lot of options and that you are making some progress.  Criticizing this for lack of theme is silly, it's comparable theme-wise to most euros- it vaguely feels like you're managing a very abstract Roman empire.  Anyway, the game is great and extremely fun.

Juego de puntuar por todo, en el que lo más novedoso es la utilización del mancala para escoger las acciones. Me encantó ese detalle. Uno de los mejores de Feld, según dicen. A mí,desde luego, me parece excelente. 

A los pocos días me lo compré. Ahora mismo estoy esperando que llegen. Comprado a Zellfhirot, en Mayo de 2014 por 29€, y libre de gastos de envío. (fueron 58 por ese y un JdT, con gastos de envio incluidos).

A Great game.
So many ways to score and you need to be on your toes to see what way you need to take to score points.
The manacala action is a nice touch to the game.
Only played with two players, but think this could be even tighter with four players.

Trajan has one of the most interesting action mechanics I've ever seen in a game. That being said, it takes some adjustment to get used to. You also have a relatively small amount of actions throughout the game, so there is a need to make them count! One slip-up can really cost you! This is a game where you SHOULD get better with each play. There seems to be a variety of winning strategies and lots of replay value. It's a very solid euro!

Fun Euro-esque game. Definitely a "point salad", and multiple plays will reward a better understanding of the pros and cons of various strategies. Theme is close to non-existent, and only a few hours removed it's already starting to blur with other similar Euros. Still, it was enjoyable enough and I would play again.

One play. It took me an entire 1/4 of the game to fully comprehend all the placement meanings. A lot of different scoring possibilities which favors the experienced player. Heavy gameplay which could lead to e xcessive analysis with the cube distribution especially, though this is the most interesting element of the game. Need another play to firm up this rating, either up or down.

Trajan is probably one of the most intriguing designs of Feld thanks to the mancala mechanism at its core. I fear, however, that you cannot have enough control over the mancala to interfere with your opponents' moves at the same time you are pursuing your own agenda. Other than that, Trajan is a typical Feld's design: a race in which you can score points in dozens of different ways. This time there are no rats or enemies: the difficulty lies in the restrictions imposed by the mancala. More plays needed before giving it a final rating.

Wow! A lot going on in this game! I definately enjoyed my first play but until I can get my head around this game I won't be able to give it a concrete rating. I can't see it being lower than an 8 though so that shall be its rating until further plays reveal how much higher it goes.

I didn't have the first game let down that I did with Castles of Burgundy though. However, I also didn't have the first game euphoria of "I love this game!" like I had with Macao either. Curious to see how my perception of this game will change over time.

First play, initial feeling is favorable.  While it suffers a bit from "you can do almost anything and get okay points", it does seem that working towards larger bonuses through different approaches is important.

Interesting, but frustrating game.  I can figure out what I want to do, but I can't for the life of me figure out how to accomplish it.  Or rather, I cleverly manage to accomplish Task A, only to realize I've painted myself into a corner, and have no access to anything else I need -- AND IT'S ENTIRELY MY FAULT!  (At least if all the Mancala bits were combined, I could blame my opponents.)

I'm fascinated by the game, but I haven't decided if I really like it.  I just need to have Advil (or alcohol) handy when playing.

Trajan my second Feld title, and definitely a little bit heavier than Castles of Burgundy. My wife doesn't much care for it, complaining that it felt grindy and aimless.

A masala of game mechanics.  The mancala, linked with the actions you can take, is brilliant.   Other elements, less so, but taken as a whole, a satisfying game with constant scoring and numerous opportunities to confound your opponents.  A first timer will probably get clobbered.

RATING: 10
Wow, mind blown. I literally had mancala dreams the night after playing this for the first time. We also had a good hour-long discussion afterwards, which usually means a game is good (though not everyone at the table agreed).

Mechanically, it's wonderful. Like Macao, this is one of the only games in which I can actually plan four or five turns in advance, the mancala (like the wind rose) serving only as a mnemonic aid to help visualize my strategy. It's such a simple idea, and actually makes the game more accessible IMO (as opposed to games like Chess in which planning multiple moves in advance often requires years of practice). Yes, the theme is nonexistent: like the mancala, the Roman setting is there to help players visualize and remember the different scoring mechanisms, which are engaging and fascinating by themselves. 

If I had one complaint, it would be that being unable to fulfill Rome's demands doesn't seem to be punishing enough: it is perfectly possible to win the game by largely ignoring the demands (or most of them). On the other hand, consistently fulfilling them might give you enough of a lead that you could win this way as well. There are so many ways to earn points that you could try a dozen different strategies, all of which seem equally valid. If this is a "point salad," then please, give me seconds!

Initial rating after 1 play.  This is my first experience with a mancala mechanism in a game, and it was impressive.  I can see why this game is rated what it is and look forward to bringing this to the table frequently. Although I had some AP moments towards the end,  I'm pretty sure that this rating will go up.

3/24/15: I'm very impressed by how good this game is and how well it plays.  New players seem to struggle somewhat with planning long term moves on the mancala(myself included),  but the choice of actions and being mindful of the time track make this a compelling 
play. (9.0)

Somewhat surprisingly, a fairly conventional VP scoring system (position in the senate, buildings, territory etc) combined with a central play mechanic that really f**ks with your ability to accomplish any scoring makes for an enjoyable challenge!

Really neat action planning game where, due to the mancala-like system, you often have to choose between what action you need now, and what actions you may want access to in the near future.

Other than the novelty and coolness of the action system, it's the fairly typical Feld point salad game, where a billion things score you points in various ways, and you're trying to most efficiently capitalize on those various point scoring methods.  There are definitely ways to focus on certain point systems, but you'll likely end up using all of them at some time or another throughout the game.

Despite all of the rules surrounding all of the point structures, the game actually ends up being quite a simple in terms of what you do on a turn.  The main heaviness comes from trying to decide what to do from the many options presented.  For this reason, definitely avoid this game with AP-prone players, as it would likely turn the game into a nightmare.  However, with a reasonably quick group, this game is a fun one.

RATING: 9
 trajan is such a neat puzzle of a game even if the theme feels a little bland.  i've noticed the advantage of going first in this game especially if you take a double trajan action tile early on.  If a player starts collecting multiple 9 pt trajan tiles, it is hard to counter this later on.  But there are numerous ways to score in this game and good players can stifle this winning strategy.

RATING: 8
Another great point-salad game by Feld. The artwork is a bit drab and may not attract new gamers, but the gameplay is fantastic. Once the player figures out how to plan ahead with the mandala, there is a possibility for some very rewarding scoring combos. I feel this game will only get better with more plays.

Goodness gracious! What a brain burner. I never struggle with AP, but there were periods of this game that I felt like I could have done with a whole hour to figure out my turns.

Trajan does just about everything that I hate in a boardgame. It is totally unthematic (even when compared to classic-era euros, which I'd much rather play),  it has a tedious setup, it smooshes together a bunch of uninteresting little subsystems into one big uninteresting system, it is wearingly dry, and senselessly overwrought.

And it isn't like I'm a Feld hater either. Bruges and Castles of Burgundy are both pretty good. They aren't exactly my thing, but I've enjoyed playing both of them. Trajan, unlike those two, is cold and calculating and heartless. 

I will never play it again. Never. And I will be really happy when this style of Eurogame goes out of fashion -  which the nature of the hobby being what it is, shouldn't be more than a few years away - and we get a return of the more straightforward and thematic Euros of a couple of decades ago.

Not sure why this game is the 2nd highest rated Feld game. It's a good game but I feel some of his other games deserve more credit.

Nothing links them together.

The mancala mechanic is just genius. It's a pretty standard Feldian point salad game, but where it shines is the personal player board. It would be an OK game without it. With it, it becomes one of my personal favorites. Lots of paths to victory, lots of choices to make. There's a lot to learn still, but I am always willing to go again.

I like some of Feld's games, but this has even more of the 'throw a lot of crap at the wall and hope some sticks' vibe. Planning on the mancala wheel is not fun for me. I prefer the wind rose in Macao, which is somewhat similar, because that feels more like managing chaos and is impossible to plan perfectly.

Feld has been able to make his mechanistic games work for me because those mechanics were so insanely clever. When thats not the case, it's a pretty spectacular failure.

Wow... my head hurts.

Trajan, along with Ora et Labora, is a game that really gets my gears turning. There's so much going on that every turn presents a number of different decisions to make. 

The heart of the game is that mancala mechanic, and it's a fascinating "engine" for the game. It's complex to manage, but yet surprisingly easy to pick up. I expected to struggle with it more than I did. The game also went by more quickly than I expected.

This is definitely Feld, so if you're a fan of his stuff, you'll like this, and if you're not, you won't. The "meeting demand" phase adds a bit of hardship, but we're not talking In the Year of the Dragon or even Notre Dame brutality here. And if I look hard enough, I even see a little bit of a theme peeking through!

I'll be playing this more for sure, as other fellow gamers appear to like this as well.

Update: 2nd play online, and I'm loving this. More than any other Euro game, this is the one I want to play at least 5+ times to uncover its depths. What I love about this game is that I find myself looking ahead 2, 3, or even four turns. That's a different feel than some of the more highly tactical games I've played that prevent planning ahead. Trajan allows you to set out to try and do something, and then figure out the right path. It's a blast so far and I'm really amped about this game.

Update: ...and so, I've played the game 10+ times now, and I can safely trade away my copy. Only two of those plays were of my actual copy, and the physical game simply won't see much play in my circles.

After 10+ plays, I still freakin' love that mancala action selection, but the rest of the game is bone dry regarding theme. Castles of Burgundy has more theme (weee!!). The other annoyance I have with the game is the distribution of those extra action tiles. My group has learned to abuse the X2 and the forum to quickly strip away any action tiles for others. With less than four players, it's even worse if you commit to a strategy but then never see the extra action tiles for that strategic path. 

I'll play it but I don't need to own it.

The mechanism is good but the theme is something like pasting on it.  Too many victory paths for which it makes players easily to get lost and become out of focus.  The way you plan, you dig into it may turn out to be blocked by other players and suffer a big loss.  Actually, there is no way to figure out whether it is a good move or not.  This game can only be good to play with experience gamers who know the rules well.   I like playing it but not as much as Burgundy and Tzolk'in.  It is a good game and I'll try its solitaire variant.  I will get this game in one of the days.  Maybe I'll wait for the big sales in our retail game stores.  In the meantime, I can only play it with using my PnP version which has been finished on Sept 4, 2013.

A really nice Eurogame where you have lots of options on how to accumulate enough points to come out as the winner, but despite all the decision making - it never really brings the game to a halt.

Quite possibly the best point salad game out there. The usual Feldian interleaved mechanisms are masterfully intertwined, and there surprisingly exists a sense of theme. But what endly elevates the game above all other of each kind is the unique Mancala mechanism. Highly recommended.

I have mixed feeling about this game. It is a euro which I would put at the upper end of midweight. There is a lot going on. Everything you do will score you points, but you can't get everything done that you would like. My main criticism of this game is that it is very difficult to tell who is actually winning (or more accurately who is in a better position to win at the end). Like many euros there is limited ability to peg back the leader (or who you think is the leader). I would play again, but not really my preference.

I found the game uninteresting because there are so many ways to get points, and all those ways are so well-balanced, that the player's choice of how to acquire those points doesn't much matter.

Fascinating combination of mostly disparate systems. If ever there were a VP soup game, this is it. While I don't personally have a problem with such games, it's doubtful this will rise above an 8 for me for one very clear reason: it's nearly impossible to pay attention to what everyone else is doing. It takes significant processing looking at players' individual player mats in front of them to even figure out what their options are. In practice, for the folks I play with at least, it's intractable. So what other players will do becomes a large random element. At least in the short-term. I still think it's interesting enough to be "great".

My first response to Trajan when it came out was 'Feld, skip'. Feld is about constructing clever mechanisms and exploiting them. He's made a number of games which are about creating point snowball engines and exploiting them: that is rarely my style of game. But in Die Burgen von Burgund he has shown to be capable of creating good puzzle games, and after having played Trajan in a more relaxed setting at the request of my partner (who harbours less prejudice against designers), I find myself liking this design too. Trajan is rather like Burgen in the sense that the players are solving a point puzzle rather than creating an engine and milking it for all it's worth; but the Mancala-style rondel adds an interesting twist to the story in that what the players can do is bereft of randomness whatsoever apart from the initial distribution of tokens in the cups. Also, Trajan plays a lot quicker than Burgen, also at greater player numbers, and that adds to its fluidity. Finally, the physical appearance of Trajan is better than Burgen with its washed-out colours and thin alea-cardboard. 

I mentioned 'puzzle game' above, and that is really all you need to know. In my collection and its peripheries you can find titles like Shipyard, Cities, 20th Century and of course Die Burgen von Burgund (and perhaps, a smidgen of Dungeon Lords too)—if you like these titles, you can safely assume that you'll like Trajan too. If not, then you'd probably want skip this title. So, what is not to like? Well, that is [i]is[/i] a puzzle game, as paradoxically as that may sound. In Trajan there is little in the way of interacting with other players. Oh, there can be quite a few little pinpricks where player A takes a desirable resource just before player B can, but that is all there is to it. There is no feeling of being clever in this regard, no need to come up with a tricky and inescapable tactical combination of sorts. Also the central timing rondel is a little cumbersome, but with some experience it works nicely.

But the fact that it is an unashamed puzzle game makes me hesitant to increase the rate beyond 7, although I really like Trajan, and cannot, for the time being, envisage it leaving my collection. I expect more of the [i]game[/i] of a title when it is awarded an 8 or higher. I need to mull on this for a while while playing seamlessly at all player numbers.

RATING: 5.5
Dull. Soulless. You could replace the Roman "theme" with anything, say an Intergalactic Empire, and the game will feel the same as it is essentially a heavy Euro number cruncher. The game should be renamed to 'Generic Point Salad Hunter'. Never did I feel like I was expanding my Roman power through trade, politics and invasion. I was just figuring out how to hunt the most points with each turn. To be fair, there is nothing wrong with the mechanics, it's solid. People whom love heavy Euro point hunting salads will love this game and I get that. Those whom love the crunch of theme, story and adventure will find none here and I'd suggest Lords of Waterdeep instead.

RATING: 8.5
This game makes your mind creak from internal tension in a way that few other games achieve. The mancala mechanic is the game, not just a gimmick. As others have commented, this does a tremendous job of rendering the bureaucracy of the Roman Empire. There is constant tension between long and short term decision making, a constant need to consider whether you should reprioritise or march on ahead, and it is so hard to know what's best to do. And in amongst all this, you have to try and handle your internal administration, which requires planning out c. 4 moves in advance, where each move could damage the next one, and the colours and number of pieces you move can have dramatic implications. Incredible, but so taxing.

Didn't wow me on the first play. Mancala mechanism requires tons of planning ahead, but then there is also a lot of randomness in what tiles show up, what needs of the Romans show up, and what cards you draw. Maybe my lack of experience with mancala is the problem but this game made my head hurt in a bad way.

Would play again. The puzzleyness seems like something I would like, I just need to try a different strategy without quite as much randomness as the card drawing.

Neat euro style multi-player game.  Trajan uses a cool game mechanic for determining one's action on their turn.  This game mechanic forces players to do their allocation and plan a turn or two in advance.  The game is a constant tug of war for trying to gain victory points, avoid the pitfalls of coming up short at certain points of the game lest you take negative victory points and work towards collecting certain tiles and taking control of certain geographical areas of the Roman Empire, all while attempting to avoid other player's attempts to thwart you.

What a terrific game. I love the way the mancala mechanism forces you to diversify your strategy and work really hard for the epic combos. I feel like the theme is really strong too: you are a Roman emperor tasked with balancing the demands of the people with strengthening your empire via trade, military, senate, construction, and others. The "detached mini-games" complaint didn't hold water for me. A solid game that is superbly designed and fun to play.

Much like [gameid=55670], Trajan has a complex action-selection mechanism (which is immune to interference from other players) driving play on a board full of medium-simple interlocking mechanisms (where all the player interaction occurs). The similarity ends there, but gives enough of a common feel that if you like one, you'll [i]probably[/i] like the other.

[Though... after 4-5 plays, I find my interest waning. The board interaction isn't interesting enough, perhaps? Or maybe because it lacks [gameid=55670]'s chance / risk management. It's a decent game, but it's lost its lustre a lot faster than I expected. Traded.]

Trajan has Many Moving Parts (many mechanisms).  Much is going on, here.

However, none of it evokes its supposed theme - Rome. It could just has easily been a complete abstract.

RATING: 6
I can see why people like this: manipulating the mancala to set up bonuses as well as the actions you want is a fun puzzle. It just didn't do anything special for me. At least, nothing that Castles and Aquasphere didn't already do. 

Trajan just has too much going on - too many chits, too many options, and everything really just gets you a handful of points no matter what.  You end up spending a lot of time setting up and maintaining pieces of the board that you'll never get to (very similar to Great Western Trail, which we also disliked).

Castles does the "bonus action" thing in a simpler and more satisfying manner - and you build something too!  Aquasphere does the pre-planning thing in a much more transparent manner, and is far more interactive (Trajan is just a race, while Aquasphere has competition for things on the board, as well as a more significant area control aspect)

I don't think that I've ever encountered a euro with less theme, especially given its audacious linking of a mancala-based action selection mechanism with the Roman Empire.

But it works as a euro, and, at least for on-line play, it keeps me somewhat engaged because every action gives you points and the mancala selector has you thinking several steps ahead.  Nonetheless, I will say that it is terribly overrated.

That's a good game, but the players order is definitely an issue. With players at the same level, winning when you're the 4th to start is nearly impossible (less bonuses, very probably 1 less move than the others). I don't understand why nothing in the rules correct this problem. Because this is a problem. Definitely. 
I move down my note from 8 to 7 after a lot of games because of that. Starting a game when you know you'll lose it because you're the last to play is unfair and less interesting.

The Feld of all Felds. A showcase for what I dislike about his games: several sub games combined, all using unconnected mechanisms, constant scoring by everyone no matter what they do, and at the end of the game someone wins but couldn't tell you why. And no connection whatsoever to the theme they've hung on it. I can't imagine that the person who designed the box cover had ever played the game. 

It's not like I don't enjoy playing his games--they aren't *bad* games. They just all have the same feel to me: clever, soulless machines. You play one a few times until you've figured out how the mechanisms fit together, and then the next one comes along.

Update: I really disliked this the first time I played for all the reasons above, but recently played again and...rather enjoyed it. The mandala mechanism is actually pretty fun. But everything I said stands.

RATING: 8.6
As in all the others best known Stephan Feld´s games, the theme is almost absent, there are lots of ways to gain points and there is (almost) always something useful to do when reaching each one´s turn.
The basic mechanic of the game is a kind of "round mancala" that puts your brain to work a lot but it´s also one of the assets of the game.
The set up requires a little work and time, as some knowledge of the game rules is required to make the game a little more swift, but the strategic experience is well worthwhile, as in others games by Feld.
The game can however deliver some punishment, if a player doesn´t manage to make the right action at the right time or if the (random) people´s demands don´t match the tiles we invested before...

The mancala part was not as difficult as I thought, but I didn't put a whole lot of thought into making the most effective plays. Playing this game with players who take a long time to make the most opportune turn would drive me mad.

It seems like an oversight to not allow each player an equal number of turns, especially as there is no balancing mechanism for turn order.

Trajan is much more streamlined that it appears at first. The mechanics flow together smoothly and there are many, many possible paths to pursue.

However, the theme is only OK. Mostly, you're simply trying to cobble together a series of tokens, cards, tiles and moves which will combine for maximum points. There's much more of a solving-a-puzzle feel than a ruling-an-empire feel.

(Don't get me wrong, the puzzle aspect of this game--including the mancala-like action board--is actually pretty good... it's just a bit dry.)

If you don't already have Macao (also by Stefan Feld), absolutely get Macao instead. If you have Macao and love it, you'll probably find Trajan worth getting, too. They're not really all that similar, but Feld's designs do have a distinctive character to them.

Can't swing a dead cat in this game without scoring points, but to win you gotta swing consistently, in the right directions. Learning to play the mancala action wheel is crucial to victory. There are action combo chains to be had which multiply your scoring and definite benefits to concentrating your actions within a few of the 6 available. My two games (one learning, one teaching) have been around 2.5 hrs, but they're not painful.

Lots of layers of interactiveness here and the mancala mechanism sets the game up for lots of analysis and preplanning. Having said that, you will therefore like it if you like long dull periods of analysis. Luckily the interactivity is low so you can plan your own turn effectively during other player's turns.
OTOH, if you hate slow analysis games, you'll find this overcomplicated and fiddly with a bit too much to track. This could probably be pulled apart and into 3 or more excellent games but has a bit much "kitchen-sink-itis" for me given zero linkage to the theme.

Each winner so far has employed a different strategy from the other winners, and it wasn't necessarily the strategy the winner wanted to employ. The mancala board limits your available actions, so you have to adjust your strategy accordingly. Trying to integrate your movement around the mancala wheel with the rest of your game can induce modest AP, but what great fun.

[2015-03-02 First Impression]
To put it short: Trajan blew me away. It's been some time since a game this heavy impressed me that much and made me want to play it again immediately. Complexity is the name of the game, everything seems to be connected with everything else and it's easy to get distracted by all the shiny bits. On top of it all, you have the mancala that controls your actions and currently I'm really bad at managing it. 

But I guess, Trajan will only get better once you figure out the mancala . While your first game will see you struggling for the action you want to do, I guess further games will reveal a lot more strategic layers. How do I set up my mancala initially? Which free actions will I hunt after? What are my opponents up to and how can they interfere with my plans? How can I manage my mancala so that I'll be the start player in the next quarter so that I'll get first dips on the new shiny tiles? So much to think about and I'm not even remotely close to reaching this level of play.

I was thinking about Trajan for some days after I played it and I'm really looking forward to get it to the table again as soon as possible. But this might prove to be a problem as I think that this game won't work well with my regular gaming group and this has something to do with the kind of game Trajan is. Like most Feld games, I think Trajan will be enjoyed most if you value mechanics more than theme.

A steaming pile of poop. There is no theme at all. Nothing sticks to these mechanics. It's veritable thematic teflon: I can't possibly think of anything that would unify all these disparate little micro-games into something in any way fun.

Sad to note that one of the "Good Emperors"' names has been taken to make this excel spreadsheet-driven game.

Trajan is a very well constructed Euro.  It is not particularly thematic, but it is very clean and well thought out, making it easy to learn and (mostly) easy to play.

RATING: 5.5
The Mancala mechanism for action selection is extremely clever, if somewhat brain melting, although it does nothing really to connect the game to it's theme, something which applies to nearly all of the rest of the game - only the military campaigning aspect has any engagement with the subject matter. 

For some the paper-thin theme won't matter, they just crave clever ways to get VP's, but personally I like a bit more narrative to a game and this just doesn't quite do it enough. However, the Mancala mechanic and the military campaigning component to the game do add enough interest to this to lift it slightly above the other cube pushers and I would play it again and might pick up a copy if they were giving it away.

I subsequently read the following comment by Paul Lister (MR Boardgameguru) and it perfect;ly sums up my feeling on the game [i]"...game felt ...  solitaire ...with (only) a little competition for the military spaces, otherwise, players focused on own rondel. Too many point scoring routes for competition to be very meaningful. Moreover, the linked actions feel like a math exercise. Admirable, but tedious."[/i]

After 1 play, starting this out at an 8.  This is a high ranking for me for a Euro after 1 play.   I really enjoyed the decisions.  Moving the barrels mancala-style was cool mechanic, but it was a little cludgey.  "I need this color barrel here for this Trajan tile.  And I need one over here.  Wait, where have I put my barrels?  Oh and I'm going to get another tile soon.  It will go here, so I need to redo this...I can't remember what I've put down already!"
I like the variety the game offers, but I'm wondering if after repeated plays if there are some overpowered combos.  If so, that could make being first at the beginning of each quarter important.  And that is not something which can be manipulated easily in a strategic sense.

Updated: from 8 to 9 after 6 plays.  Really enjoying it.  Yeah the theme is weak, but it gives you some really tough choices and is fun.

Lowered back to a an 8 after 14 plays.  It's a great game, but I'm not finding myself wanting to request it all the time any longer.  Maybe the strategy is played out for me.

Players are Roman nobles in the time of Trajan, taking various actions and claiming victory points.  Busy game where players each run their own mancala board, with six pits and twelve stones.  They empty a pit and seed the stones, and take the action associated with their destination pit.  Actions include senate influence, shipping goods, construction, military campaigning, and so on.  These actions are interwoven, give you points, and can potentially kick off a chain of bonus actions.  Trajan tiles are also bonuses that ring your pits, and trigger if you can get the correct coloured stones in the target pit.  Busy game, takes a while to explain and get your head around the mancala mechanism, but plays surprisingly quickly once you're up and running.  As with many Feld games, a weird mechanic drives the action, and tons of victory points are out there to be had, as well as penalties for the unwary.  Thematically questionable, but nice and meaty without overdoing it.

RATING: 7
Very interesting, brainburning game of resource management with a mancalla rondel action thingy...
Game as a lot of potential since there are many, many ways of making points. Lots of different actions and things to watch for, but not too hard to grok completely. Can be overwhelming at first but i'm sure that with time, you can plot a reasonable strategy at first and adjust as the game progress. the amount of player interaction is medium to low, with the players unable to directly affect each other, but rather interact by taking away resources that they wanted.
My main beef with the game is the rules, with many little holes that need to be clarified (ie, when shipping goods, do the cards go away? if not, then what stops me from shipping them multiple times?)
Rating will likely go up with more play and more rule clarifications (keep in mind that we did play with 2nd ed rules and we felt that there were still holes to be patched)

good game - not much to say other than that. it does its job well, nothing too exciting, pretty standard feld. only problem is that since it's standard feld, it's way too point salad-y, which reduces the meaning and value from so many actions.

RATING: 8
I am not typically a fan of games with this many different, disjointed ways to score.  You've got at least three independent set collections going on, with a area majority contest in the senate to boot.  Yowza.

However, it all manages to hang together really well, and is very satisfying to play.  The various scoring methods are very well balanced, so you do have a lot of choices as to how you want to play.  Specializing or spreading around also seems equally viable, depending on what your opponents are doing.  This plays well with 2, but I'd like to try it with 4, because I think this will make things even more dynamic, and give the Senate more importance.

This is largely a heads-down game as players study their mancala, but you do need to pay attention to your opponents because there is competition for everything on the board.  

The game is beautifully produced, and is another game that makes me mad at the crappy production Alea gave to the otherwise excellent Castles of Burgundy.

A busy and complex Feld design which is essentially a collection of mini-games, all of which net you roughly the same amount of points.   It's driven by a mancala mechanism, which sounds inspired on paper, but is a little more thinky than it is fun in practice.   Production is a bit bland.  In the end, I feel like this is a bit overrated, probably because people are enamored with the mancala engine driving your choices.

There's nothing really wrong with Trajan, but not much has me clamoring to play it again, either.  It really feels like I'm playing 8 different, largely unconnected minigames, with this arbitrary mancala minigame controlling it all.  Puzzling over which colored cylinders to move from A to B, and all the different permutations of those moves just wears me out.  It's not the most color-blind friendly, either.

Stefen Feld is a genius. Bravo for making so many fun games.

Beautifully designed game. So much fun and so much that can be done depending on how you planned to move your Mancala type of wheel.

So much you want to do and sometimes it feels like in so little time before the season ends (4 rounds). There are so many ways to victory that all can have access to. I love that. And in the end although you may concentrate in a few areas you can still score points in all areas. Makes for a much more dramatic ending trying to figure out if all your hard work had paid off.

So much fun. Play this, you won't regret it.

elvarázsolt.
Kicsit a Caylus élmény jött vissza: anno mikor megjelent és megismertem ott éreztem hasonlót: sok út, választhatok, áttervezhetek, ha keresztbe tesznek, ha netán picit hibázom helyrehozhatom.
Nekünk hosszú volt, de azért mert közben volt gofri sütés, és apró-cseprő gyermekek pesztrálása az első óra után. (4 kölök, 3,5 évesnél kisebbek)
De így is mindenki élvezte.
Normál körülmények közt valszeg belefér 1,5-2 órába a játék.
(Kivéve a sokat gondolkodókkal :-))
Ugyanakkor szabály magyarázat kb 15 perc volt, és igazából az első 2-3 forduló után már mindenki átlátta, és elkezdtünk komolyabban előre tervezni. /Amit persze időnként borít 1-1 jó lehetőség/
A 4 negyedév sem feltétlen egyforma hosszú: egy idő után felhalmozódik a "bab" a tálban, és akkor gyorsan lepörög egy-egy forduló.
Szóval nekem a nagy kedvenc kategóriába sorolódott.
Csak azért nem 10-es, mert kíváncsi vagyok, h tényleg egyforma sok út van-e: első ránézésre úgy tűnik igen, de ehhez több játék kell, h tényleg így van-e
Na meg nagy bánatom, h csak max 4 személyes :-(
De mindent összevetve: végig lekötő, szinte holtidő mentes, előretervezhető, de hirtelen lehetőség lecsapási lehetőség, koncentrálós, figyelős, izgalmas
Ja és ami még fontos: szép, és jól átlátható a tábla, és a játékosok táblája is.
Update: második játék ugyanazzal a csapattal, Továbbra is izgalmas érdekes: és most teljesen más úton nyertem meg :-9.
Nagyon jó kis kombókat lehet csinálni benne -és ez több féle:
pl. munkásos trajanus lapka, munkás akció duplázó, és +2-es hozzá: így nagyon jól lehet akár 2-3 épületet is egyszerre felhúzni az építési területen. Ugyanez megvan a katonai megoldásra is, a kikötőre is -ezt még nem próbáltam, azt hiszem legközelebb erre megyek rá :-)-

I had read about Trajan long before I got it so I had high expectations.  It was well worth the wait and is a great example of well balanced Euro design, courtesy of Stefan Feld, who has never failed to impress me.  The Mancala mechanism is intuitive, fun and sometimes quite challenging.  There are lots of choices, lots of points and seemingly many paths to victory.  Good game.

One of the heaviest Feld games. Players manage a personal mancala wheel that is tied to the actions they can take and tiles they can score for points. Basically everything is worth points, it's just up to each player to squeeze as many as they can out of the game before it ends. Works well but is a bit tough to setup and explain. Looking forward to more plays.

90-120m, best with 2-4 players. < 5 plays.

Interesting Feld title, the Mancala mechanism is fun and adds a temporal layer to strategic planning.  Beyond thinking a round or two ahead, it's arranging and executing combinations.

I don't really know what can be said about Trajan that hasn't already been said: various Feldian subsystems that results in a point salad style game with a Mancala action selection method.  I didn't think I would like this game since at the end of a round (which consist of multiple player turns), you need to meet the objectives of the people or suffer negative consequences.  This is one of my least favorite aspects of Agricola and Le Havre.  Surprisingly, the point salad-style of gameplay makes it much easier for me to compare actions that help provide needs (avoid negative points) versus other scoring methods (giving positive points).  The combination of puzzling the Mancala action selection system with Trajan tiles is really the main thing that makes the game enjoyable for me. I really like the cover, but find the rest of the graphic design to be functional, but mediocre.

Decidedly tricky and complex little Feld game. I'm not really sure how "good" this is. I give this a very tentative "8/10". After four plays at this time, I need to play it with more equally savvy players to see if it's a "9" or a "7". There are definite moments of brilliance... and it's fun damnit. 

-edit-

Up to 20 plays. This game is the fucking business.

Trajan has a fairly unique action scheme, but it does feel like they gave up a little on it. The number of actions seems pretty random, since most players will prefer to make a good move then worry about how that affects their portion of ending the turn. The game also seems to be broken up into several subgames, in which you can ahive points. There is politics for point bonus cards, the city for monopoly bonuses and military for area control bonuses and discovery perks. 

Overall the game is decent, just a hair to long and the only major complaint is the general lack of theme at all.

RATING: 7
Another Feld game of limiting choices through novel mechanics. This time it's mancala. This is the first Feld game in a long time (maybe ever) that I've been satisfied with the components - both size and artwork. Another thing that I really like about the Feld designs is the high point count. High points help with differentiation and selection between two actions and there's also that 'short chapters in a book' feeling of accomplishment when you round the 100 point line. More thematic than most Feld games, but that really isn't saying too much. 

Thinking more about this game, I would say its closest relative is Die Burgen von Burgund. Instead of dice limiting your actions, you are limited by your choices on the mancala wheel. There is an increased game complication and an obvious increase in length. There may or may not be an increase in game control in Trajan since you can modify your dice rolls in dBvB with workers and acquired technology tiles. Pretty much every system in Trajan is more complicated when compared to its closest system in dBvB, an obvious exception is the combos created by castle and building tiles in dBvB. 

My first impression as a Feld fan is that both of these games are worth owning. However, if you are not as diehard a Feld fan, you may want to consider one over the other. Your preference of game length, complication, and presence or absence of dice should guide your decision. If theme is an absolute dealbreaker for you I would suggest Trajan.

While Terra mystica helped me to realize that I am more of a ludologist than I realized, this game caused me to realize that I can also be very shallow and superficial. Because quite frankly, I love the games mechanics (which are fascinating, deep, complicated, rich and rewardin) the board is so ugly!  I mean, Stefan Feld is a prolific designer, why not get an equally great graphic designer???  The box art looks fantastic, and when I think of Rome I think of amazing bold beautiful colors. Amazing architecture with crimson buttresses  set against a backdrop of one of the worlds most gorgeous landscapes... And then I open the box and it looks like... Well, this is bgg- check out the unfiltered images.  It would be great if you just stared at the box the whole time but your focus is on one of two equally ugly boards that do not look like room. The game doesn't even feel like Rome (which isn't that big of a deal). but if I'm going to be sitting staring at a board and thinking heavily about it for a couple hours I want something better to look at.  It felt like winning a dream vacation to Italy's capital and then spending the entire time working in an active leper colony.game design a 9, components and appearance a 3.

This Mancala strapped to a boardgame felt like a gimmick to me, and one that I’m not particularly interested.

Three-eighths of the way through this game I just couldn't make myself care any more, so I played the rest of the game on autopilot.  There's nothing about this game that makes me want to play it.  I'd rather browse BGG aimlessly than play Trajan.

Great Medium-Heavy Euro.  The mancala mechanic is cool and forces some planning ahead.  My favorite moments is when I figure out my next 3-4 turns such that I can pull off an action combo and at the same time complete a Trajan tile on just about each of those turns.  The variable round length also keeps things interesting and gives players control over game speed, which can lead to more interesting mancala decisions.

What happened to Feld?  He seems to keep deteriorating.  I enjoyed his early games like In the Year of the Dragon, but stuff like Macau was really dry and boring.  Trajan is easily the worst however.  Players just spend an inordinate amount of time staring at their little cube wheel to pick up dry themeless tokens from various parts of the board that score in slightly different ways.  Feld reminds me of a caricature of the criticism against Knizia, but in this case it really is soulless, themeless and mathematical.

Turned out to not be my sort of game.  Lots going on, and rather clever (especially the Mancala style movement) but all comes across as rather dry and abstract - felt like lots of mechanics put together to produce a game, and was the theme added afterwards?  I don't know about the theme/setting being added later but this is one that failed to engage with me. Nice bits, clear graphics, small amount of luck in the game.

RATING: 9.5
This game is amazing.  It ranks among his finest works (Year of the Dragon, Macao, Bora Bora, & Castles of Burgundy).  Length of time takes around 2.5 hours w/4 players, but is so gripping the time flies by very quickly.  I love the Mancala action circle system.

A few small caveats prevent this game from reaching a perfect 10 for me though:

1) I'm not overly fond of the era-end mechanic.  It seems odd, and while it may be balanced it doesn't feel that way.

2) I would have preferred less commodities. Having less, but worth more points for the senator tiles (and maybe only 1 face up draw pile) may have created a better system.  I suppose the varying amounts is important for the balance of pairs vs. different cards.  This aspect of the game does not match the greatness of the other mechanisms (i.e., the building sector and the Trajan tiles).

3) Finally, the military path seems to be slightly weaker than the other options for scoring VP's and collecting tiles.

But in the end, this game's a keeper and Stefan Feld surely did it again - another masterpiece!  Grade: A

I wasn't totally blown away by my one play - it felt slightly clunky with SO many victory-point salad things going on.  That said, I'm still thinking about the game quite a bit and am quite taken with the mancala-rondel.  I think this has potential to go either way at this point.

This was my favorite new Essen game from BGG.CON 2011. So many paths to victory, and so many points available to grab. The action selection "mancala" mechanic is so cool and accounts for so many deep and agonizing decisions. This mechanic is reminiscent of Finca, but the game is very heavy compared to that family game. There are several people I would never want to play this game with because there is plenty of opportunity for analysis paralysis. Rules will probably take a half-hour to explain, but each turn is a small enough, bite-sized piece of action that it is not overwhelming. I can hardly wait for a North American publisher to pick this gem up!

The orange and green bits are basically indistinguishable.  The pink and blue bits are different, but just barely.  Would require significant conversion to be colorblind-friendly.

I will probably never play this game again because of the color issues.

The game itself was marvelous.  Given that there are two criteria for the BGG rating system ('want-to-play rating'  and 'good/bad' rating), I averaged the two (8 for gameplay, 3 for the fact that it'd take serious convincing to get me to play again).

If I manage to find or buy a converted copy, or a new edition is colorblind-friendly, then I will update this rating.

Excellent use of Awele in a boardgame. The two depths of the Awele mechanism (get to the action, and match colors to get the Trajan tile) are pure genius. The only drawbacks are the easily forgotten time keeping mechanism, the relatively long play time, and the lack of long-term strategy. I still want to play it again very much, and this game could go up to a 9.

2012 birthday gift! I'm getting more and more satisfied with Stefan Feld's designs... I still don't try tis one but I'm pretty sure it'll gonna be one of my favourite games. After give it a try I'll post here my opinions and rating.

2012/11/12 UPDATE: Feld is becoming one of my favourite game designers of all time and Trajan is, IMHO, the best Feld game so far! The use of mancala system is outstanding. The game is fast paced (as with other Feld's designs), but is very deep (deeper, in fact, than Castles of Burgundy). Trajan is a tactical and strategic game (I'd say 50% of each). There's a lot of posibilities on this game to choose from, but it's game system makes feel it lighter and easier than it really is (wich is something I love on Feld's games: that feeling of "easy to learn but hard to master"). For now my rating is a solid 10. Let's see if in the future this changes or not, even though, I don't see it very probably to happen.

Nagyon érdekes a körberakosgatós ahogy mechanizmus összekapcsolja az építkezést és az akcióválasztás. Ez önmagában 10 pontos ötlet. Kicsit bánom, hogy szerintem túlzásba vitték a köré épített halmot. Nomeg egy ilyen komoly játékhoz képest szerintem méltatlan a kártyák által generált igen nagy szerencsefaktor. Azért bőven van mit kiismerni benne, szóval szívesen játszom még vele.

Played once and that will probably be the only time. 
The rondel mechanism is fun; pick up the cubes in one cup put one in each following cube perform action of the cup in which you put the last one. Possibly score a bonus action if 2 cubes in that cup match the bonus action tile.
However the actions you can perform are, move a pawn here score point, put a cube on that grid score points etc. It does not feel like it mathers very much what you do.
It takes 90 minutes and gets really dull after 30 minutes

RATING: 5
Trajan shares a lot with Castles of Burgundy. So much, in fact, that I'm going to claim it's pretty much the same game with just the action selection mechanism exchanged for the mancala-style rondel. There are a few other minor differences (CoB has a stronger spatial aspect, for example) but in both games the focus is essentially on solving a micro-optimization puzzle. Perhaps not surprisingly it feels rather similar to Macao in many respects, too, again with another way to select actions.

Macao at least has a bit of uncertainty and some sort of risk/reward or short/long-term tradeoffs whereas Trajan is just straight point-mongering from start to finish. I have no idea why people get excited by playing solo mancala in order to compete in various mini games, but apparently they do.

Der Ludo Centurio Stephanus Feldus verbaut sein Talent für geschmierte Verzahn-Denk-Puzzles im guten alten römischen Spielethema. Im Zentrum der Macht steht in TRAJAN ein schöner Mancala-Mechanismus, der sechs Aktionen umfasst, die sich dann in diversen zusätzlichen auslösbaren Boni-Aktioni wiederfinden. Hier! Da! Dort! Überall lassen sich Züge optimieren, Siegpunkte sammeln und wieder abziehen, falls man die Bedürfnisse des dekadenten Volkes nach Brot und Spielen nicht erfüllt. Die Kritiker von Feld werden in TRAJAN problemlos fündig: viele Stellschrauben am Streitwagen und Siegpunktgesammel an vielen Stellen lassen den Spieler zum Eichhörnchen werden. Und seine Fans werden glücklich sein: TRAJAN ist ein funktionierende römische Einheit, Schönheit für das Auge, haptisch in seiner Plättchenflut, üppig im klemmigen Handeln. Der Autorus dieser Zeilus reiht sich ein in die Legionen der Zufriedenen.

Prototypical Feld game. Lots of colored cubes, a myriad of possible actions, most of which are pretty meaningless as there are only a few really good ones, you get points for every fart that you blow out, there are a sh!tload of endgame points to earn for numerous tiny things, there is very little that ties the dozens or so mechanisms in the game together, and theme is pasted on. It's probably not the worst Feld game, but that isn't saying much.

Interesting mechanics for (i) the choice of the action with the mancala system (ii) variable round length.
Solid gameplay with different choices but not enough time to do everything that you want (in other words you have think about your moves wisely).
Low incidence of luck (basically the draft of cards).
The interaction, while indirect, can be very cruel if players start putting obstacles on each other's way.

So only one play, meaning its a bit inappropriate to make a decision, and I appreciate the game design and mini-games within, and would play if asked, but for me its the annoying time delay between looking at your mancala player board and work out the next 2-3 turns, and then the wait for these turns to take place that stops me saying lets play it again.  But, why listen to me, when the  Shutup Sitdown review explains it all much better than me (provided you watch all of it!). (Rating 6.803, Feb 18))

Here's another Stefan Feld game that feels like a signature game if only because it has his style all over it! The rondel/mancala mechanic is very clever and I did feel like I was analyzing it constantly to try to make the best moves. And it was interesting to think about it and plan to use it optimally. The actions that are activated through the rondel are less interesting and frankly feel very disconnected. I think Feld is at his most brilliant when he can take very smart ideas and still tie them together in a seemingly abstract/Euro game. I don't get sucked into Trajan the way I do with Luna, nor do I feel everything comes together like CoB or ITYotD.  It's a much more impressive game than Macao, but I still walk away with the feeling that the parts just didn't come together as a whole the way I wanted them do. A good game (and fascinating design as always) but slightly underwhelmed by the experience.

That mancala system to choose actions is sooooo cool, like every one says, but another truth is that it makes reading the other players strategies a real pain.

Actions are selected using a mancala roundel system which is the central mechanic of the game, onto which are bolted six very simple mini scoring games plus end game scoring possibilities - the options are many and the mancala mechanic is very interesting - an excellent resource collection/VP conversion fest.

All the bits are excellent. Very good resource/vp conversion puzzle game.

Great Game. Lots of ways to score victory points, yet have to be aware of things that can take away points. Love the use of mancala in this game.  Can mess with other players objectives, but not in your face. The only thing stopping this from being a perfect 10 is the theme (Roman growth).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I love that mancala aspect to this. Some very deep thinking required, especially if you're planning on a turn or two in advance hoping you can manage to get the actions you need. This does lead to some AP, but I like the brain burn. Hopefully your players are tolerant of this. The Roman theme doesn't come off very strongly here though, which is a shame because this is one of those games I bought because the box art compelled me. The tiles and things you are doing seem very abstract, and it is indeed a points maximizer. Impressive design. Fun, but purely mechanical. ie: Feldian.

Top 100 material, after Burgundy, Macao, Notre Dame and In the year of the Dragon this game proves that Stefan Feld is the designer of the moment. A mancala system, many mini games that alltogether forms a puzzle that works flawlessly and deserves a very high position in the rankings. Eurogame at its best, a kind of rondel-mancala game that offers many different paths to victory. Trajan is one of the best games of 2011. Sure it lacks theme like most Feld´s games, but the mechanics are really good and though not very innovative, they havent been used in many eurogames.

I can't think of a single thing about this game which could be better. The game is full of choices and contains so many variables that it appears to have almost infinite re-playability. It also appears to be a game that will reward repeated plays. There is a curve that I sense here that will make me better the more I play, but I also strongly suspect this game cannot be "solved" because of the random nature of the tile distributions in the game. The game is awesome!

I'm a huge fan of Stefan Feld, have about all of his games, with Burgundy and Macao being the favorites. I had of course the highest expectations for Trajan while patiently waiting for it for almost half a year. It is finally here and so far i only played one game. Here are some early impressions.. Well, to sum it up, I'm slightly underwhelmed. Here is why:

- It is indeed his most complex game, a bit too complex for my taste. Also a bit too long. I do feel however that it will get easier/faster after repeated plays.. if I can get it to the table!
- The mancala felt a bit too uncontrollable and frustrating during this 1st game. I hope it will get better!
- Replayability may not be as good as some of Stefan's other games, because the same materials are used in every game and setup is pretty much fixed.
- The game is too mechanical and disconnected from theme, even for Feld. It probably doesn't help that I don't care for the Roman theme, to put it mildly. In fact I'm sick and tired of all the forums, senates and laurels, to put it less mildly.

Even despite of these flaws, you can see I can't help but rate Trajan a 9. I still enjoyed it more than %90 of mediocre stuff I played this year. I think it will only get better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Early impressions are that this is Stefan Feld's best game. The mancala-like action wheel does a great job of creating interesting multi-dimensional decisions for the players. Those who, like me, enjoy puzzle-like qualities in games will appreciate this new mechanism. Matching the colors of the beads in order to earn Trajan tiles adds that delicious extra layer that makes the game so challenging.

The rest of the game is less important, but seems to provide the necessary level of balance and variety, and perhaps just enough interconnectedness to keep Trajan from feeling hodgepodge. As with several of Feld's games (especially Rum & Pirates) Trajan feels like walking through a carnival moving from one mini-game to another. Each mini-game has a little bit of urgency attached to it at different times in the game, such that the specific sequence of performing the actions is important. Setting up these efficient sequences on the mancala wheel is nerdy fun.

I do wonder about the game's staying power, since it displays all of the features that typically keep me from loving Feld's games: disjointed, overly mechanical, and not interactive enough. But two plays in, I'm loving it.

We borrowed and tried it. We are really enthusiastic of the Mancala system, which is not so brain-burn as thought, one can manage 3 turns at least. The problem is that the rest of the game consists of disconnected little games. The components are good. The theme is not felt, but that it is not a drama.
We were not completely convinced from Trajan, thus we ordered Concordia.

This might be your regular euro game. You have to put workers or select actions in order to get points, the player with the most points wins. But there is an excellent twist and that is the way you select your actions. The system is entertaining and it keeps you thinking your next move. A great game for experience and newbie players, not so hard to learn. The art is good and the theme is more or less, you don't feel the theme a lot but just enough to justify the roman period. Love it!

This was an interesting puzzle, but the first game felt like learning a system rather than playing a game. (We also got a pretty crucial rule wrong.) I think I'll like future plays of this in direct proportion to how often I get to play.


Edit: played again and felt much more in control. I really like this one.

Of Feld's "point salad" games, this might be the one that I like the least. There is a lot going on. Finding a way to maximize the value of actions taken in the different minigames and your movement around the mancala is tricky.  But this is one where I just fell like I'm moving tiles and cubes around to earn buckets of points.  I feel no connection to the game as I play it, and the minigames (aside from the main mancala mechanism) are not very interesting.

Trajan is a very good game by Stefan Feld, the winner is the player with the most victory point.  There is a lot of ways to score VP in this game!

On is turn, a player most choose one of his plate and take all the action marker in it and drop one of them in clockwise order in each of the next plate ("Awale" style).  The colors of the marker matter because you need a combinaison of 2 colors to activate a Trajan bonus tile.
The tray where you put your last marker is the target tray and you will be able to do the action specific to this tray.  The actions are :
- Seaport (take cards or discard them to gain VP)
- Forum (take a tile in the forum section of the board)
- Military (move your leader or legionnaires in different provinces for tile or VP)
- Trajan (take a Trajan tile)
- Senate (gain VP and maybe a bonus card if you're the most advance at the senate)
- Construction (move worker to take construction tile that give VP)

At the end of a quarter year, each player have to meet the people's demands or they will lose VP.  Also, the leader at the senate choose a card that will give him bonus VP at the end of the game, the player that is second take the remaining card and flip it (the bonus will be less for him).
The game end after 4 quarter, the winner is the player with the most VP after the final scoring.

The "Awale" system for choosing action is something I haven't seen before.  It takes some time to get use to it and be able to do the action you really want.  The bonus for having the right colors in the right cup is really nice, it need some calculation to get!

Medium to heavy euro game with probably pasted on theme. Critics may even claim that it is point salad.  But game mechanics wise,  I really enjoy the challenge to optimize my moves with the colored cubes in the  mancala bowls to get the most synergies (= resulting in victory points) of it.   The design is rather functional that being a beauty .

Not as varied as Macao, and I wish it were-- because the mancala action selection is probably my favorite hook among the Feld games I've played.

Fantastic game, possibly one of the best I own. The central mechanic uses a rondel that requires you to continuously re-distribute actions around the circle. This rondel is hard to wrap your head around and provides some very meaty and delicious decision making. All the mechanics blend together beautifully and make sense thematically. Like the best Euro games out there, it's an uphill battle from start to finish, and a bit of a head scratcher. Highly recommended!

I really enjoyed this game. There is a lot of ways to earn victorypoints (typical for Stefan Feld games), which makes it hard to guess who is ahead during the game and keeps the game interesting. 

The main mechanism is to move tokens of different colors in 6 bowls, dropping one in every subsequent bowl and doing the action at the last bowl a token is dropped. This system kind of reminds of the rondel, but with the added touch of the tiles you try to complete with these moves. 

The crux of the game is to have as many turns as possible where you can do multiple things, using the double tokens, the trajan tiles and the tools. 
All six options seem quite balanced and equally viable in gaining points or preparing for a better move.

I hear a lot of criticism abot the theme in this game, and I have to say it is nowhere near that bad, sure, it is a point salad, but most of the actions do make some sense, thematically and be honest, you don't go after big euros for theme. There is also much more interaction than seen at first glance.
Very solid game, plays well with all player counts, although I do prefer it with 4 players.

Preliminary rating after 1 game.  One of the heavier Stefan Feld games (which I really love, especially Burgen von Burgund and Luna).  The Mancala action point mechanism is quite innovative and as usual with Stefans games there are multiple paths to victory and you literally get points for almost everything while playing.  My initial impressions are however mixed.  The feeling while playing is not as positive as with Burgen von Burgund.  There is so much going on and you cannot do everything at once which leads to a quite unsatisfactory feeling (was this really a good move?  Did I overlook something?  Maybe the other option was better?!)  Need to play this one a few more times to come to a final verdict.

I'm hesitant to rate this after 2 plays because I want to like it.  The mancala action selection mechanic is ingenious.

From a design standpoint I'm not sure there is anything really wrong with the game.  It just hasn't resonated with me.

I was a little leery at first about trying this game as it seemed like it had so much going on, but I must say that it didn't take long to pick up after a little while of playing. Of course the game's owner explained the game extremely well, so that really helped. 

There are so many paths you can take, and trying to set things up with the pieces you move from bowl to bowl is half the fun of it. You have to plan ahead to get to where you want to go and also have the stuff your people demand at the end of each year, or you will pay for it in lost VP's. 

There are lots of ways to get VP's and boosts for VP's, so the options are many for choosing your path to victory.

Edit: Bumped up my rating with another play, fantastic game!

This is a very 'thinky' eurogame which focuses entirely on optimising your actions/decisions at the right time. Like many of Stefan Feld's games, you'll also be punished if you don't do things effectively (in this case, losing victory points for not meeting the demands of the people).

Overall, it's a strong gamers game, but it does significantly lack theme/flavour. This is certainly true for many euro games, but this is probably the prime example for me. Still, it's tactical / strategic challenges will certainly appeal to many, as it does for me.

Really fantastic, awesome game.  I am kind of surprised that there is no impending doom like a volcano ready to turn your senators to crisp bacon or like hordes of barbarians ready to sack Rome, it's a Feld game after all.
I might downgrade this to a measly 8.5 if after a few plays I find the theme too thin; another potential problem is AP players who will become obstipative with the mancala-like action selection mechanism.
If you have the slightest interest in games featuring inventive, original and precisely crafted rules, then you must own this.

RATING: 7.5
A mix of several worker placement mechanics, plus set building.  The "bowl" can be a brain burner, as it forces you to plan a few (3) turns ahead.

Possibility of action combos with Trajan and Building Tiles.  Will you be going for the bonus action, or pick up that Building tile which will hopefully allow you to have a set of 3 or 4 at the end of the game (and score a bonus 10 or 20 points)?

Some interesting decisions, and you can't really be blocked, although other players can pick up a title you were looking to get.

The "people's demand" is a nice clean mechanic which forces you to allocate a few actions in order to secure the needed tiles (forum or military) or Trajan permanent tiles (which are only worth 1 VP but will end up saving you time/actions).

The "time clock" allows for 2, 3 or 4 player configurations.

In the end, it's all about scoring points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great eurogame. Heavy game with lots and lots of options. A few plays are not enough to get a taste for all the possibilities. The bonus tiles give you some interesting objectives to shoot for but certainly don't dictate the course you have to take. The game plays well with two, three or four players.

RATING: 5
The latest example in the ultra-complicated Euro trend. Euros used to do one or two things really well, now they try to do ten or a dozen things not so well. The Mancala bit is so good, but everything else about this game kind of rubs me the wrong way. There's no elegance here, just a big pile of scoring mechanisms that all work in their own unnecessarily convoluted ways. Most of them bear no relationship to each other, and it seems like you can just pick a couple scoring possibilities and ignore the others. The timing mechanism is a little too fiddly, and since it's not particularly interesting there's a good chance it will be forgotten from time to time. There is some true depth, though, in the board movement, wherein you can do some real planning. I would love to see this in a stripped down game (though not stripped all the way down to Mancala) with fewer actions and special scoring things to remember.

Please, game designers! Edit! Cut out the chaff and just give me the wheat.

Wow! After one play, perhaps my favorite Feld game.

The mancala driven actions ARE (as advertised) a lot to think about, but the play seems to drive along fairly quickly despite that, especially once the bins start to collect larger numbers of color tokens.  I very much liked that way that player bin selection could drive the game at a faster or a slower pace- the element of some control definitely added some appeal for me.

The art and production values are stellar, nearly perfect, and hide the fact that this is not a particularly Roman mechanism and that the theme is a mask for a fascinating game engine.  If you don't like mancala, this may not be for you, but it's not as ridiculously brain-bending as advertised (e.g., certainly less painful for me than Agricola.)

In some ways this is also a less-painful Feld design; while there are quarterly demand rounds which can deliver a large pain in the VP, there are also plentiful ways to acheive VP, and to collect needed resources, so the game doesn't feel as tight as say, In the Year of the Dragon.

But I can easily see this as a top-50, or even a top-25 game.  It reminded me of Goa in that there are many ways to succeed, but a mix of careful planning and opportunistic acquisition is needed to finish first.

Based on a 1st solo 3-player game, I am starting this at an 8.25, with definite room to go higher.

So far, everything about this game appeals to me; and what more do we truly ask a of good/great game?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.25
Definitely a point salad style game, but that's Feld's style.  

There is so much going on in this game and I love it.  The main driving force of the game is a mancala style portion of your player board.  There are 6 actions and you can get points via all the actions.  On top of that you can get bonus actions/points if you match up certain colors on your mancala wheel with bonus tiles you have assigned on it.  

It sounds and looks like a confusing game but once you play a round of it you'll understand how everything fits together.  

This is a great mid-heavy weight Euro game.

(03/21/2014) Comment based on one play.

This is by far Stephen Feld's best of the various "point salad" games I've played--[thing=25554][/thing], [thing=70512][/thing], and [thing=84876][/thing]. It is a clever blending of familiar mechanisms from other games, along with a brilliant implementation of the mancala mechanism, seen in [thing=1970][/thing].

This game is a step towards a more deterministic point salad game, rather then the stochastic CoB, where the action choices were randomly generated by dice. Instead, the mancala acts as sort of a "rondel" (as found in [thing=19600][/thing]) hybrid, both allowing a selection of one of six actions--the last pebble sowed selects the action--and pick of a "Trajan" tile, if the conditions are met. Although the mancala seems chaotic and random, there is no luck--the player has complete control over the set of possible future actions, as well as the sequencing of them. Further, the number of "pebbles" sowed serves as the game clock, moving the game along the four sub-quarters of a quarter of a year, for a full year. A number of smaller moves can result in more turns per sub-quarter, but there will eventually be an acceleration in the game, when a player eventually has all or most of their pebbles clustered in a bowl or two.

As with his other point salad games, it seems that almost every action will result in a gaining of VP. The challenge and appeal of the game is in the search of maximizing VP per action or trading off less VP for a more lucrative payoff later in a combination of actions.

The VP landscape for two of the six action types is randomly generated at the beginning of the game, but is held relatively fixed for the rest of the game. The map of Europe has regions with known VP values, but has randomly assigned bonus tiles in each space. A sequence of military actions can first get the bonus tile through movement of the leader, followed by placement of a legion to secure the VP for that space. There is also a 4x5 grid of Rome, with randomly assigned building tiles, each with a VP value. A sequence of build actions can result in placement of workers to claim a building tile and associated VP value, as well as triggering an extra action for first-time builds for each of the six building types. Interestingly, subsequent workers must be placed orthogonally, much like the placement of tokens in the districts in [thing=531][/thing]; as such there is area control and blocking.

Each season, a "Voice of the People" tile is revealed, much like the "Voice of the People" in [thing=554][/thing], where the players must collect specific bonus tiles (from the forum or from military actions) to offer as tribute to placate the people--in terms of "bread" and "circuses" or piety--lest they lose VP. This punitive feature is similar to the "rat track" in Notre Dame, but as with ND, there usually is enough time to prepare. The main focus in satisfying this demand is either through military action by moving a leader into a space with a bonus tile, or initiating the forum action, where there is a random assortment of bonus tiles and bonus action tiles. With other Feld titles, VPs and other incentives are offered to the players briefly, before being removed from the game. The same holds true for the forum tiles.

The senate action has a two-fold function, both determining the seniority order for the next year and correspondingly increasing VP for every subsequent action, but also for determining who will be "consul" and selecting one of two end-of-game bonus conditions. A "vote" is taken at the end of every year, with the tally being the sum of the senator's standing, plus any "vote" bonus tiles they've picked up from forum and military actions. These are similar to the civilization cards in [thing=34635][/thing], since they give more VP for collecting specific commodity cards, or other lucrative VP bonuses.

The shipping action allows players to draw commodity cards randomly, where they try to form unique sets, and them playing them out on their play area. The commodity symbols behave much like the symbols in [thing=9216][/thing], where huge VP counts can be gained for such as 2/3/4 unique commodities, 2/3/4 of of the same, or pairs of commodities. The selected bonus conditions could give additional VP for playing specific commodities.

The last of the six actions is selecting a "Trajan" tile. Surrounding the mancala are six slots, where the Trajan tiles are placed. The last pebble sowed triggers both the action and possible selection of the trajan tile associated with that action. Each Trajan tile has two pebble colors; if the bowl contains the two pebble colors that correspond to that tile, the VP on the tile are awarded, along with an extra build placement, military placement, bread/circus/piety capability, +2 extra action tile, etc. 

As can be seen with this long-winded comment, this seems to be an extremely complex game, with many, many intertwining mechanisms, but each of the six "mini games" is not that difficult. Still, rules explanation took approximately 45 minutes, but familiarity with CoB and other Feld games was helpful in shortening that time. Thus, this is not a game one could conceivably take to a board game meetup, since it would take too much time to set up and explain. The game has strong random elements in how the VP landscape and in how the "Voice of the People" are formed, how the forum bonus tiles fall out, end-of-game bonus conditions, as well as how the Trajan tiles come out. Beyond that, the mancala gives the players complete control over their destinies. So, this is more in line with traditional VP layout games. Still, the players are overwhelmed by the assortment of VP paths available. AP with the mancala is a strong possibility, and with three or four player, downtime could suffer. Despite this, the mancala mechanism alone is a fascinating game mechanism to explore; however, it's internal workings seem to have no corresponding meaning to reality! While the selected actions are meaningful within the context of the theme of ancient Rome, I cannot rationalize [i]why[/i] or [i]how[/i] that action was generated--yeah, the last "pebble" was thrown into the "forum" action bowl, and the colors of two of the pebbles in that bowl happen to match the Trajan tile that is associated with that bowl. What does that mean? Why do I care?  What does fulfilling a Trajan tile really mean? Perhaps that is why some call the theme pasted-on. If one is willing to look past this inherent "weakness" or "disconnect", this is a great game--this may be Feld's best game, but that remains to be seen. Initial rating: "9", with potential to move up.

最近のフェルトと比べると各得点獲得トラックにおけるインタラクションがある程度は保証されていて、ドイツゲームの香りを残してるかと思いきやアクション行う手段がマンカラのため必要な時に必要なアクションがとれず、実際人と絡めるかどうかは手番の綾でありマンカラの綾である。もちろんマンカラに習熟すれば自分や相手ができるであろう行動を読めるようになってくるはずであるが、そこまでやりこみたいと思えなかった。最近のフェルト同様数ある選択肢の中から点数の高くなる最適解を検討するというゲームであり、それが面白いとは思えないのです。

New players will always lose to a veteran, you need to have at least 3 games played before you can create a decent strategy. But it is a fun game.

Recently got as a gift from my pal Kaizen Zanshin, for Christmas. I'd been eyeing it for some time, and he was looking to trade it...so it was a welcome addition.

RATING: 6
The action selection part of the game made it difficult to adjust your game to suit what was happening with other players.  This made the game fairly solitary in practice, with players making the choice you were going to make more sucky when it came time to do it.  Since you couldn't adjust and take a more interesting action to stall or change easily it made me fight the system more than I'd like.

Lots of choice, and potentially you have to think many moves ahead.  But in fact I have done well without thinking too far ahead or even having a strategy. Hmmm....

Loved all the different paths to victory. Everyone who played our first game felt that it was a bit disconnected. Almost like we were playing a bunch of mini-games. The reason why we enjoy Feld's games so much is because of how integrated all of the mechanisms are. This was wasn't as smooth as some of the others.

Definitely a good game and I will definitely play it a lot more!

Stefan Feld was never going to be my favourite designer, but this is the first Euro that I've actually loathed. An over-complicated, point mongering exercise based around a rondel-type mechanism that would need buckets of AP to get the best out of. I simply can't see any possible strategy at all, never mind competing strategies or strategies that might win. Playing this is like opening the back of one of those gold pocket watches, it's intriguing to see the mechanism at work, but you can't usefully influence what it does.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There's definitely a lot going on here, and the game is pretty abstract, so it's a little difficult to piece it all together.  The mancala thing is very interesting, especially since it feels as if it were possible to plan several moves in advance, if only one could conceptualize it properly. I'm not there yet. That isn't the only thing going on in the game; there are several possible ways to specialize and it seems like a lot of the game has to do with choosing one and somehow making it work, with the mancala serving a rondel-like function.  Interesting. Must play again (difficult, as nobody seems to have a copy of the game!) (1 play)

This game has a lot going for it. Great theme, fascinating point structure, and it all centers around a mancala-like bowl in which you determine your order of actions as well as earn bonus abilities. 

There are several separate play areas on the board, and like Shadows Over Camelot this creates heavy pressure of having to do several things in several areas while limited to only one move per turn unless you manage to chain actions. I thought the Mancala like mat that every player gets was a highly fascinating mechanism, which I would try to plan several turns in advance on. The time-lapse device was also pretty ingenious. In the end though, Trajan felt kind of mechanical. While the game was a mildly fun variant on the worker placement genre, none of the separate areas really felt compellingly immersive. Nothing about the game really enthralled me or caused me to want to play again. That said, I can understand why it might be appealing to some as a strategy game with low player interaction or conflict.

Un juego poco convencional gracias a que el nucleo de tensión reside en el Mancala y es su mecánica principal. Con ella, hay que lograr hacer la acción que nos interese y combinar colores para hacer la acción extra. Además me gusta la lucha que hay por las mercancías y la tensión que se genera gracias al registro de turnos, lo que hace importante el ritmo y secuencia de tus acciones. PROS: Se puntúa por todo, aunque hay que distinguir las acciones que dan más puntos de las que no dan tanto (y el riesgo que corres eligiendo las de una clase u otra). La habilidad de Feld para mezclar (una vez más) las decisiones a largo/corto plazo con un mecanismo penalizador (las demandas del pueblo). CONS: rezuma A/P. Sensación de estar jugando a minijuegos (no tan apreciable como en Vinhos). Tema pegadísimo. Auténica experiencia en solitario con escasísima interacción entre jugadores.

Other that being a big point-salad with a paste-on theme, Trajan has no marks against it from me.

The mancala mechanism for taking actions is quite unique and enjoyable to puzzle-out as well.

Exceptional Euro style game. Trajan has several legitimate paths to victory.  Each turn is short as each player only makes one brief action.  This game has a relatively mild degree of player interaction, however opponents will frequently take tiles from the board or perform actions that foil well laid plans.  You can make things more difficult for your opponents but you can't totally destroy them.  The mancala mechanic implementation as a means to choose your action totally rocks.  I feel like this is the perfect game.  You must plan a few moves ahead in advance and it is very stimulating to analyze the game in progress and plotting how to maximize the victory point yield of your actions.  This game shares a trait with Castles of Burgandy, to wit: clever combo actions can be carried out, with proper planning, that are super productive.  Successful completion of a big combo move is a compelling rush.  Play Trajan; it rocks!

Was still enjoyable, but seemed to really stretch the "Point Salad" to the breaking point.

High point: the Mancala device was a lot of fun.

Low Point: Tracking the damn mancala points used each turn.  Fiddliness of the board.  Lack of any sort of theme (I don't need much).  Very weak spatial reasoning aspects.

Mancala mechanism has smoothly merged with other boardgame mechanics, such as set collection, hand management and area movement. The so-called Mancala movement provides various fun and possibilities of the game. The theme is also in good harmony with the game. In order to fully understand the game background, I've even studied the age of Five Good Emperors in Roman Empire. Trajan guarantees lots of fun and high replayability. The rediscovery of Roman Emprie history is an additional exciting and attractiveness.

RATING: 3
I don't like most Stefan Feld games. Trajan, as with Castles of Burgundy, has several different mini-games intertwined, with multiple paths to victory that translate in practice to (1) the need to specialize and (2) relatively little player interaction, and it's pretty easy for oversights to occur in terms of keeping track of everything on the board and all the different scorings that happen. I didn't care the for the mancala element; I'm not crazy about mancala in the first place, and here it just felt like a rondel on which you play a separate mini-game.

------------------------

Alternative version for those who prefer more snark: 
--In Trajan you are playing mancala . . . and a few other similarly abstract games at the same time. 
--Well, why don't we just break out the GIPF series and do that thing with the potentials where you can play the games all together? 
--Because it would be really thinky and we don't like abstracts that much. But now that I think of it, Trajan is pretty abstract and thinky, plus the rules are way more fiddly, such that the rules explanation will take much longer and during the game we're really likely to make some small error that will end up deciding the winner -- but it's got a pasted on Roman theme!
--Oh. Yay?

Se trata de un juego en la línea de su autor Stefan Feld. Euro con el tema totalmente pegado pero que es agradable de jugar. Un tablero central donde vamos haciendo diferentes acciones que simbolizan la conquista de un territorio, la construcción de una ciudad, el mercadeo con productos de la época, entre otros, 

Como otros juegos de este hombre hay una mecánica central, "idea feliz", que en este caso es el uso de una especie de Mancala para la selección de la acción a realizar por el jugador. Cada jugador tiene un tablerito personal con seis cuencos que tienen unos cilindros de colorines. Cuando le toca jugar elige un cuenco, coge los cilindros del mismo y va colocando en sentido horario uno de esos cilindros en el resto de cuencos. Hará la acción asociada al cuenco donde coloque el último cilindro. Además, los cilindros tienen colorines porque asociados a los cuencos podemos tener unas losetas con beneficios que se activan si tenemos los cilindros de colores adecuados en el cuenco activado. Vamos que puede resultar un poco propenso al AP si hay alguien que se dedica a pensar en un plazo muy largo.

Si no hay nadie muy tontorrón con el tema de planificar se puede jugar en un par de horitas como parte de una sesión de tarde

In Trajan, players are Roman nobility during the pinnacle of the Roman Empire seeking to further develop Rome and extend its reach through constructing public works, military deployment, political influence and mercantilism.   The player who best navigates the intricacies of the central game mechanic – the mancala – by timely stringing together actions to earn the most victory points wins the game.  

Thus far, this is my favorite design from Stefan Feld.  The innovative mancala mechanism creates tremendous opportunity for tactical and strategic planning.

RATING: 9.5
Really great game. It seems all Feld games are some twist on actin selection, usually with some sort of restriction to which actions you can select. In this one the restriction is a personal mancala mechanism, so proper planning means you're never locked out of the actions you want. The game itself is made up of a bunch of minigames, but the genius of the game is how interconnected they all end up being, so the game does feel like a cohesive whole. And the way the Trajan tiles work is amazing as well, they force you to work harder planing your mancala more precisely in exchange for some really powerful bonuses.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (October 2012)

I’m now officially a Feld fan. This game is very interesting, from the Mancala mechanic to (try to) plan ahead your moves as best as you can, to the demands at the end of each year. Particularly the demand mechanic is great as it creates a tense game (a la Notre Dame). I found the game to have a lot of interesting decisions, it is not a heavy game, but planning in advance of two turns can be very challenging. 

On the bad side, the theme is (sadly) paper thin, I didn’t felt it at all in my plays. Also, I’m worried about the replayability factor, perhaps it is best to play this from time to time as each game plays very similar. The Mancala mechanic (although great) can be very repetitive. 

I’m downgrading it to a 7.0 because I no longer want to play this every time. Still I consider it to be a good game that I would like to play from time to time. When I first played Trajan, I thought it was the best Feld game, however, nowadays, I’m longing to play more Castles of Burgundy. 

Current Rating 7.0

As I´m writing this, I have logged 13 plays. My initial fear became true. For me, the game sorely lacks in the replayability department. Nowadays, I almost always oppose a game of Trajan, the game plays too samey for me each time. I recognize it is a novel design but Trajan has fall out of favor. Now it is one of my least favorite Felds. I´m glad I sold my copy.

Heavy shit. You have your own player board where the game happens. This decides with game you play on the game board of the 6 possibilities. They are even interrelated to make it even more difficult.  Each of these games has 4 turn options. It's neither easily explained, nor easily played. We enjoyed it, but I wouldn't recommend it in general. 

Side note: Trajan relies very much on trust - or make sure everyone shows the actions on his own player board clearly. It's like the game wants you to cheat. (I do trust my friends, but still)

Set in ancient Rome, Trajan is a development game in which players try to increase their influence and power in various areas of Roman life such as political influence, trading, military dominion and other important parts of Roman culture. The central mechanism of the game uses a system similar to that in Mancala or pit-and-pebbles games. In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau. This is a Euro-style strategy game and playing time is 30 minutes per player.

Couldn't get into this Feld. The mancala wheel kills it for me-too easy to get "stuck" while someone else runs away with the victory.  No alternative paths to victory to explore and at the same time no one single strategy-just spread yourself thin wherever the points can be grabbed and make sure you're always the winner each round or you'll never catch up.  Possibly better with more but did not enjoy as a 2p.

RATING: 7.5
I've only played this game one time, so I have to say I've only barely scratched the surface but I think I really like it. The mancala is a brain burner of a core mechanism, and the different areas appear to leave the game very open to different strategies (assuming you can make the mancala work for you). I definitely want to play this more.

Update: I've played Trajan about a half a dozen times now, and I still really like it. It's a brain burner of a puzzle, and I really, really like it.

Trajan is an innovative game, mainly due to the use of the mancala mechanic. There is a lot going on here--perhaps too much. A game of this depth is prone to AP, but it can move quickly with the right group. I'm not usually a fan of point salad games and the theme dangles by a thread, but my overall assessment of this one is positive.

Initial play was pretty awesome. The mancala worked my mind over more than I expected (and I loved it - brain burn is a good thing). Looking forward to playing again soon!

My second play left me just as excited to play again. I think it is a great 2-player game, but the Senate race would be a good bit more interesting with 3 or 4 players. This definitely has potential to be a top 10 game.

RATING: 8
I will say I have yet to play a badly designed Feld game, but neither have any of his games been home runs or personal favorites. For me, his games run the spectrum of meh to really enjoyable and Trajan is definitely in the latter camp.

The core of Trajan is pure mancala-inspired action mechanic where a player picks up a pile of colored action stones from one bowl and distributes them, one at a time, to other bowls in a clockwise direction. The last bowl to get an action stone is the action that the player performs. There are lot of tiles to collect, people you can turn into workers or legionnaires, senate voting for end game points, people's demands to satisfy, bonus actions to gain,... and more! Most of these choices generate points (or prevent from losing them), hence the "point salad" label. Despite the amount of small point increments players can constantly gain, there are specific paths that generate larger point totals over a few turns and players who plan best balancing short and longer-term opportunities will come out ahead. I very much enjoyed manipulating the mancala stones to get the actions and bonus actions I was shooting for and figuring out where to most effectively expend my energy. Really good stuff!

Yes, the game works and people who like this sort of thing will like Trajan.  It does its thing well but I really don't care for what it does.  Themeless, min-maxing VP, set collection, 'agonising decisions' blah blah blah.  Someone with AP could make this game really tedious - the rondel needs to be calculated and its not trivial.  I really dislike the rondel.  Feld is the antichrist and Macao, Notre Dame and Trajan are the unholy trinity.

There's so many different things going on in this game, and it's a testament to the design that things still go along snappily and I never had to really sit and think and calculate as I have to do in other games that have a similar level of complexity (e.g. Confucius, Dominant Species or Power Grid).  It feels almost like a "euro olympics" because there are kind of 6 minigames going on at the same time, and, while they are inter-related, and while the Mancala is the "gear-wheel" for all of them, it still doesn't feel as cohesive as Feld's other games.  Not that that's a bad thing, just an observation.  Now that I think about it, this aspect of Trajan is actually nicely thematically appropriate given the "epic" scope of the subject matter, vs. the more intimate Luna or Strasbourg for example. (And, yes, I am one who enjoys the themes of euros rather than ignoring them :D) The Mancala elevates the game to a very unusual and interesting experience.

After 4 plays, upgraded from 8.5 to 9.2.  One of Felds' best.

At first the Mancala mechanism to select actions can be a bit of a brain burner puzzle. It is necessary to get good at the puzzle to take one of the six actions that you want. Sometimes you may not be able to get the action that you really want, so you need to decide what is best of the actions available. By the end of my first game I was loving that puzzle element. I also liked the variety of options that scored victory points.

The weakness of the game is that its' kinda 6 little games, barely interacting, bound together by its very clever mancala mechanism.  The mancala controls which game you get to take an action in, which is a fascinating change.  However, I prefer games that are more of an integrated whole.

Trajan was the heavy Euro game that interested me the most at Spiel 2011. Trajan didn't disappoint. Lots of options, an innovative central mechanism inspired by Mancala and potentially many ways to winning. My only concern is that there won't be much differentiation among equally experienced players as any selected strategy will yield a comparable amount of VP's and small efficiency advantages which won't even be noticed at the time could decide the game. Nonetheless, I almost bought the game. I only decided otherwise, because I found Feld's last year release Luna for half of the money they were asking for Trajan which shares the same characteristic of many ways to generate VPs.

I will not deny that Stefan Feld's designs are soulless cubepushers with only a thin veneer of theme, and very tired and overused themes at that.

But the inventiveness of the systems he comes up with are intriguing enough to make me want to play each one at least a few times. The mancala mechanism is a little more enjoyable to me than the windrose in Macao, very inventive and unique.

I'd definitely like to play this one some more.

My biggest gripe with this game is that the mancala system CAN be planned multiple turns ahead of time to land the cool combos, but my brain simply does not work that way. I'd be fine with a mancala that other players interact with, making the planning impossible, but the fact that I can't just makes me feel frustrated during the game.

I like this one less and less the more I play it (online). It's eight subgames or so, none of which are fun on their own. The mancala thing is brilliant but since you're only playing that particular subgame on your own board, it's considerably less interesting than it might otherwise be.

I'm not sure the best move isn't just to take the 9VP tile over and over and over and just try to keep Rome satisfied, picking up the odd VP here and there as possible. 

Play it a few times and see if the shine doesn't come off for you, too.

2014.04.25 Wow. There is so much to do in this game. It's a wonderland of options. It's heavy as Agricola but far more fun. There are so many ways to win: you can focus on shipping, on set collecting, on conquering, on getting straight victory point tiles. The mancala/Finca windmill thing is a fun mechanic, and the bright colors of the markers on are a nice visual contrast to the grays and beiges and browns of the rest of the tiles. Just a freaking great game.

The mancala mechanic in this necessitates you plan many turns ahead in order to best maximize your actions per turn. I really enjoy the game at all player counts and even at 2 players I still find it very competitive in all the different parts of the board. My preferred player count is three for this game, lots of options for points but it is imperative that you watch what your opponents are doing and react tactically.

A delightful puzzle. Which, yeah, describes all of Feld's games. At a glance, it seems like player interaction is nil. Not true in practice, as everyone is all up in everyone else's business pretty much immediately. Your strategy is always dictated by the actions of other players. 

Want to go all out military? Well, back home a rival is gaining traction in the senate. Better hope you can plan far enough ahead to be able to balance the two. It's about knowing what you have to do, and manipulating your player board to be able to do it.

RATING: 7
Trajan is a solid Euro worker placement game with a mancala-style action selection mechanism. The use of the pieces in the wheel limits your choices, but does so in a way that really forces you to plan ahead. You can set yourself up for huge combos if you plan well, as it's possible to place multiple meeples and take multiple actions in a single turn. The theme, well... it's pretty much irrelevant. But the board, pieces and rulebook are all top-notch. This one definitely suffers from analysis paralysis, but there is also no downtime, as you are constantly analyzing your own possibilities. Suffers from the problem that it is a game of calculation, so if you don't feel like calculating constantly-shifting possibilities you won't feel like playing it.

[b]Trajan[/b] is typical Feld's point salad game. Its like 5-6 little games put into one package, that are not tightly interconnected (if at all). 
Theme is pasted on completely, but this one somehow fits perfectly. 
Main mechanic (which is typical for Feld to have one central thing in his games) is Mancala, while there is also set collection, area movement, hand management,etc. 
Whole game you'll feel like trying to solve different puzzles and as game is really good optimized, you'll never feel left behind with nothing to do. It's always some other option. It's hard to describe it as it is abstract in nature (with pasted-on theme).

Cada elemento do jogo é maravilhoso! As 6 Ações funcionam de forma muito bela! Adoro o senado, os navios de comércio, as capanhas militares (apesar de as ter usado pouco no meu 1º jogo)... Elas parecem mini jogos num jogo maior. Mas o mecanismo usado para se executar as ações é cruel. Ser capaz de controlar a sua mancala sabendo quais serão suas próximas ações é crucial, pelo menos senti isso. Pessoalmente o acho estressante - mas não tanto.

I didn't like it the first time I played it. But then you started to discover how much stategy The game actually has and now I think it's a pretty good game. The mechanics are also fantastic, even if I think the seaport action is underpowered and the construction action is overpowered.

I would rate it even higher if it had a stronger theme. So, if you don't really care about theme, you should check this one out.

Another keeper from Feld who is quickly becoming one of my favorite designers - his sheer ability to blend different gaming elements and mechanics into something that is enjoyable is quite impressive.  Complete lack of theme integration is not a big deal for me (which this game significantly suffers from). For the most part, the game is a fairly solitaire experience but does have a few actions that do benefit the players who do them earlier so there is a bit of a race element. Using the Mancala mechanic in an effective way to set up future desired actions takes some getting used to if you are not familiar with it. In terms of scoring options, there are 6 primary actions, some of which have several sub options and can also trigger the Trajan tiles – all of which reminded me of Feld’s Castle of Burgundy (in terms of ways to score points). The variable numbers of turns each round did not seem to be a big factor in our games so far, but I could see players using that more effectively to end a round prematurely if the situation presents itself. Getting the 2X markers and the permanent demand tiles early in the game can free up a lot of other actions as well as create some nice combos later in the game. Game length for 4 new players was around 2.5 hours, but I can see that dropping to 30m/player after a few games which is similar to Luna and Burgundy. So far, 4 players appears to be the best player count due do the increased competition for the different areas.

Good tactical game with a typical Stefan Feld design. So, essentially an optimisation exercise of the many different ways to collect points. The innovative use of the mancala mechanism for the action selection is what the game is all about.

Halfway there: the mancala action selection mechanism is really clever as are some other parts of the game. However there is also a lot of stuff which adds complexity without really adding any depth (or fun) to the game + the game is a bit long as turns can drag when players think about what to do (while the mancala system is clever, it's also very AP prone).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
Finely crafted but exceedingly dense german euro. Definitely a poster child for "point salad" type board games. Will need a hardcore gamer to appreciate and not be simply obsessed with trying to make the mancala work for them. Will need additional plays to appreciate its depth, I expect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very clever, but the mancala mechanism leaves me feeling like I'm spending more time on thinking how to effectively move hexagonal wood pieces around to achieve the actions that I want to do than trying to earn fortune and glory in ancient Rome. Lots of moving parts in the system, perhaps a few more than I am inclined to want to coordinate in a game.

Second play leaves me feeling same as the first. I appreciate that this is a well-designed game, but it's not for me. One more play to confirm.

After 10 plays, I'm pretty sold on Trajan.  Once you play it enough you really start seeing ways to strategize, interact with others, make the luck of the draw work to your advantage, etc.  All these elements are said to be missing by negative reviewers.  If they just don't like the mancala mechanic and general play, I'll let them hold their own opinions.  haha  But saying there's no player interaction for instance is just plain wrong once you know what you're doing.  It can be extremely cut-throat.  Or, if you're playing it with less advanced players, it's easy enough to dial it back and just let a fun game experience unfold for all players.  As to complexity?  I taught this game to a somewhat disinterested 12 year old in about 20 minutes that now can't wait to play again.

Manipulating the action wheel - mancala - is a big part of the game. Other than that, it is a typical Feld: intricately designed, plenty ways to get victory points, rather dry, and very thin on theme. Overall, this is one of Feld's better games. I definitely prefer this to Bora Bora or Macao.

I love the challenge you face in selecting your action through the "mancala solitaire" and the time track improves it also, otherwise it's a quite basic worker placement and "convert this, that and then some stuff to points". The different actions and options are executed pretty nicely too, but the game as a whole could be a bit less of a spreadsheet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Its a point salad! I really like the different actions you can take and I think they come together well. I sometimes find the mancala to be a bit annoying, but it's a unique way to prevent players from taking the same actions over and over.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A "huge" point-salad-game. The basic mechanism is mancala/kalaha style which is interesting, but a bit dangerous as well: you make easily mistakes in long-time strategy and mancala system means also danger of AP. All this means, that Trajan takes quite a much time which why it's best with 3 fast players - still it takes 100 minutes to play.
So this is quite heavy and lengthy game from Feld and compared to other similar games from the same designer, this goes in the same game category with Bora Bora, Castle of Burgundy & Macao. For my taste Macao is the most interesting one and all the rest are more or less in the same line. So yes, nothing terrible wrong in Trajan, but nothing spectacular fantastic either. I just don't get it, why this is such a high in ranking?

Lots going on, although it lacks theme. A very well made Euro game. Point salad type of game, where the areas of the board are very inter connected, with in direct player interaction.

RATING: N/A
A very deep complex victory-point salad. The thing that sets this one apart is the "mancala" mechanics during action assignment, which means something as simple as choosing an action is never simple, always requiring you to set up future moves and/or settle for something less. It's a brain burner, not for everyone, but I like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Felds gone hardcore.  His signature is there, with population needs that have to be fulfilled every quarter to avoid penalty.  The core mechanic is Mancala, the ancestral African game plundered very effectively.  Around this, multiple independent minigames allow the player to rack up points based on the output of the Mancala mechanic.  Trajan is a very dense and rich game with a an exceptional number of paths to victory that involves a high amount of thinking.  The theme is there but not particularly strong.  Medium player interaction, mostly competitive, but very controlled and little/no ensuing chaos/randomness.  The Felds game of choice for the cerebral crowd.

A very good Euro with lots of moving parts.  Multiple paths to scoring, mixing interim Victory Points and End Game VPs.  Some planning is required and that's why I think 3 players is best so the downtime is limited.

RATING: 8
Feld did a nice job using mancala as the central mechanism to fuel a game.  As usual with Feld, the theme was totally tacked on and could have been anything.  I found impressive how other people chained together actions and were able to manipulate their mancala board so well.  This proved more challenging for me, but I look forward to developing my skills on this one.  Lots of chits.  AP prone players could end up taking a while if they try to think too far ahead and forget how mancala works...;-)  There appears to be several viable main paths for VPs as well as a couple choices for secondary paths.

Perhaps the rating could go up after more plays.

The mancala mechanism is really interesting, though, so if I had a chance to play this or Bora Bora again I would probably choose this one.

Played at Unity Games XVIII. This one was white-hot at Unity and was on my list to try out, even though I haven't been that crazy about Stefan Feld's games. Feld tends to come up with one interesting mechanic and then sticks it into a bland, by-the-numbers exercise. Trajan has the requisite weirdo bit (a mancala board to determine actions) and then throws just about everything else into the mix. It's hard to NOT get some points on every turn -- hell, at one point I sneezed and got four points for it. It was a good enough time, and I'd play again, but it did kind of feel like someone took the "lost bits" box from last year's Unity and made a game with them. (To be fair, I did terrible, and the guy who played before did well, so there is a thing going on here.)

This game is great.  It can be as random or strategic as you make it based on how you manipulate your own board.  Once you've got that down, you need to contend with other players getting in your way going after points.  It does a great job of balancing points you collect along the way with end game points.  Also, it's nearly impossible to win by dominating one area of the board, you need to diversify (among the senate, military, shipping, and workers) during the game which makes it very challenging and very fun.

A good Feld game.  Very mechanical with all the different systems.  The theme is pasted on and at no point during the game did I really feel like I was doing anything Roman.

I'd definitely play again but don't necessarily need this in my collection.

Trajan is Stefan Feld's masterpiece.  It is an excellent game with many different paths to victory.  The main mechanic is a mancala mechanic.  The theme is very light but the game has so many clever mechanics and ways of collecting victory points.  The temporal element of the game is pretty ingenious where you have more or fewer turns based on far you move your pieces on the mancala board.

After five plays of [b][thing=102680][/thing][/b], it appeared to be holding its own as a two-player game to play against my wife.  She enjoyed the mancala puzzle and so did I.  But after a few more plays, we both kind of got bored of even the mancala and the accompanying smorgasbord of VP-generating actions.  In spite of the smorgasbord, it appears that concentration in the Construction area is key to winning the two-player game.  In all five games we've played, whomever has had the most points generated from this area has won the game.  I hope that at some point I might be proven wrong on this hypothesis.  The biggest criticism I have of the game in the awkward turn mechanic.  As simple as it is (advance X on the mancala, advance X on the turn track), it's not intuitive to actually move the turn marker.  I'm positive our games have run longer due to one of us being so involved in our move and the subsequent actions, that we've forgotten to advance the turn marker.

I love Stefan Feld designs, and this game is no exception. The main game mechanism, the mancala, is a great puzzle. Player interaction is fairly indirect, although since it's often obvious what others are planning for, there is quite a bit of effort spent on figuring out whether or not you can take a certain action before someone else beats you to it.

The absence of luck in this game means it requires more mental effort than some of the Alea-published Feld designs, which makes this a weightier game. Consequently, we don't play it as often as we do Notre Dame, MAcao, and Castles of Burgundy, but it is nevertheless a fantastic game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I must admit, this game is dry. I am a Stefan Feld fan and I think Trajan is the less appealing (in terms of "charming power") of the games I've tried so far from this designer; neverthless, this game provedes a huge bunch of fun! You challenge yourself before your opponents so every time you try to push your skills further, because at the end of each game, any time, you'll have the feeling that something cuold have been done better.
Moreover, I've always liked how in Feld's games the mechanics merge together like a perfect gear and this aspect really shines in Trajan. Not to mention the Mancala wheel, which is really tremendous and makes the turns absolutely not repetitive (which, instead, is something I noticed in other Feld games.

[Played once]
Albeit tecnichally interesting as a puzzle of maximization of the score (mainly achieved by performing "extra actions" here and there), it feels like a mix of mini-games loosely tied together.
It is very hard to follow what your oppoents could do (let alone try to interfere with them), so it has a very pronounced "solitaire" feeling.
Theme is irrelevant (could have been just anything).

This is an EXCELLENT game. I absolutely love its games-inside-the-game mechanisms! There is a lot going on and multiple paths to victory can be chosen.

I fell in love with this game as soon as I played it and became a fanboy of Stefan Feld's because of it. That's why I also have got Castles of Burgundy, Rialto, Bruges, Bora Bora and Amerigo, and want other games of his, such as Luna.

I cannot praise this game enough: it is absolutely fantastic. Its action taking mechanism is so awesome I wish I could shake the designer's hands every time I make an action.

I hadn't played this for quite a while and had forgotton how great it is. I guess this is up there with Bora Bora for my favourite feld game (these will probably be joined by Castles of Burgundy if I ever get around to playing it again).

Brilliant game that I can understand isn't for everybody. 6 sub games on the main board are linked by a brilliant mancala-action-selection-gonna-fuck-up-your-plans-and-laugh-in-your-face type thing on your individual player boards.

It's a head scratcher, but one that I really enjoy and would love to play any time. 

Oh did I mention it is set in the roman empire and you are competing to head the senate, use the forum, build buildings, gain military conquests, trade goods and expand the roman empire? Could almost be a Knizia!

In theory, everything in this game seemed very promising. The main "mancala" mechanism really caught my curiosity while the theme, although pasted on, was cool.

Unfortunately in practice, nothing met my expectations. The "mancala" is very time consuming. After a while it becomes tedious and boring. It's a meaningless minigame in game. The rest of the game it's not bad, but it's not great or groundbreaking either. It delivers the same feeling as (many) other games of Mr. Feld, but lasts longer (not including the equally long set up). Nevertheless, I have to admit that the theme exist in some level in contrast to other games of Mr. Feld. Not that I care, but someone might think this as an advantage.

Oh, well. I am just going to play another game of "In the year of the dragon".

I definitely enjoyed myself, and would play again, though it's still a lot of Feldian mechanics mixed together into a big heap that really isn't about Rome very much. (In contrast to something like Brass, which is also a big heap but manages to be about something more than points.)

Some fun and interesting elements but absolutely no theme and the separate elements feel disjointed. The mancala principle is cool but requires a lot of preplanning but at the same time there are so many chaotic/random elements that it feels nearly impossible to plan some things.

Rating based on 4 players.

I can see why others might like it, and I wouldn't call it a *bad* game, but this is not only not my cup of tea, it's not even in my kitchen. While I thought the mancala element was nice (though I was very bad at using it!) it was waaaaay too much of a point salad for me. Everything is worth points, everything felt unfocused due to the numerous mechanisms, there are a plethora of fiddly rules, and there was too little interaction. When you can play the entire game without paying attention to what the other players are doing, and all you're doing is optimizing your points, that is not a game for me.

What an awesome game. 

Update 12/31/14: I've considered trading this game several times, not because I don't like it, but because it's not one of Erin's favorites. To be fair, it is quite long, and I can see how it could be dry for some. What makes this game for me though is its puzzle like feel. I love the mancala. It's such a great implementation! Personally, I quite like the theme, being a world history teacher (crazy bias, of course). I also love the component quality. Kudos to HUCH Games for making some of the thickest cardboard playing boards I've ever seen in a game. If Castles of Burgandy had components like Trajan, I would pick it up in a second. I'm going to fight to hold onto this game. It's good, really good! Turns are quick and games are not overly long, especially at 2 player level. My biggest complaint is the setup time, which can be a good 15-20 minutes, if I'm doing it alone. This is by far my favorite Feld game. I like a lot of his games, but I think I love this one.

RATING: 7
I can respect the unique roundel mechanic, as well as the many different scoring opportunities of trajan. However, its not my favorite Feld. I found the roundel to be slightly analysis paralysis inducing. It's hard to plan more than two turns in advance, which relegates my next turns to being whatever the leftovers are; and it may take a couple turns to set anything back up. That's the catch 22 of the mechanic, but it can be frustrating.. Also, i found the theme to be ok, it wasn't as pasted on as some say. What hurt it more was the abstract nature that some of the scoring options were presented as. That's the part i didn't care for. But it's a good game, and scoring points pretty much every turn makes me feel all warm inside.

I can see why people like this one, but it wasn't a good fit for me.

What I like:
- Multiple paths to victory through specialization
- Mancala puts you in control of your own destiny
- No direct conflict
- Variable round length

What I don't like:
- Too much of a brain burner for me and my gaming group
- Lack of theme did not keep us engaged throughout the game. Each mini game felt independent of each other and it did not really feel like playing one complete game.
- It's hard to visualize your progress (besides points) throughout the game, compared to other games we like where you can see your board/engine building up as the game goes on.

Solid point salad game with various routes to victory.  Mancala mechanic adds an interesting twist compared to more common action selection mechanics.  2p game has some direct competition for prime action spots on the board--enough to sometimes force a rethink of long term strategy.  Battles for senate supremacy can get particularly heated with desirable bonus tiles at stake.  Conflict is likely much better with more players though.

The only luck comes from random order of tiles and cards, but this is largely offset by planning ahead with the mancala and proper timing of actions.  No rubber banding mechanic either, so the game doesn't prevent players from falling behind.  Then again there's no engine building so a runaway leader only happens if the other players play poorly.

Very rewarding and satisfying game.

Trajan is a fantastic game if you appreciate Felds. The mancala is such an intriguing puzzle, and it allows for beautiful combos. The minigames on the board are not terribly interesting, and most of the time you won't have a clue what your opponents are going for. We don't mind though, since the mancala needs our full attention anyway. My #1 game at the moment, after a photo finish with CoB.

Feld's best imo.  Gameplay is smooth, decisions are tough, and there is a lot of depth.  Plus it plays relatively quick.

Update:
I still love this game, and there are definitely multiple paths to victory, but my issue with the game is that players can choose to follow the same path each game if they want.  I'd really love to play this with more than 2 because I think that would help quite a bit...

RATING: 8
Feels like a combo of Castles of Burgundy (with the possibility of chain moves) and Bora Bora (with the series of mini games). Less fiddly than Bora Bora by far; no little rules to remember and much less maintenance between phases/quarters.

The lack of dice is somewhat refreshing. Though I do enjoy mitigating the luck of dice (Macao/CoB/Bora), being able to plan many moves ahead on the mancala is a nice change of pace. The game is still tactical in many ways, but there is the possibility for development of longer term strategies as well.

With two players, value of Senate is decreased and value of construction is huge due to less competition, making it easier to get sets of 3/4. I expect the sweet spot to be three players, balancing competition in each mini game while not introducing too much downtime.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I love the theme of this game and things that can be done in it. The mancala can force players to be very focused on what's directly in front of them (the mancala management puzzle) which makes it a little less of a social game than other Feld designs.

A little quirky in that in the Forum and Military areas, a player taking the Extra Action tiles can kind of burn through them. Watch out for or take advantage of that!

02/11/12 Played a three-player game.
- There is no direct player interaction. The worst you can do is take a tile you think someone else might want. You can't even block opponents in the builder or military areas. Its pretty much multi-player solitaire. 
- There is a *lot* going on. Its difficult to keep all the balls in the air as you juggle what to do and in what order. One could say there are too many ways to score points. All this leads to analysis paralysis / brain burning. 
- The mancala mechanic is fresh, but it and the unnamed action cylinders bear no resemblance to reality. 
- The theme is very thin. 
- Trajan seems more puzzle than game.

Very rich game. I like the mancala action selection rondel a lot. Where your movement ends, that is your action. Actions vary and take place in their own area of the board. That is the place where some interaction can take place, but it is limited. Still I like to play it and I enjoy the puzzle and the challenge, I admire the design. It is a rare exception, usually I require more interaction.

Worker placement game with little direct player interaction where a Kalaha tray movement mechanics is used to determine which of six equally dull actions to take. It attempts Euro elegance but manages to be a ragtag mishmash. It attempts a roman theme but manages to be contrieved. It attempts a brainburner twist with the Kalaha stone movement but the twist becomes a forgettable and uninspiring snag where the only difficulty lies in retaining attention enough to actually care. It attempts tenseness from limited time countdown but still remains a snoozefest. Incongruent, unfocused design, dull dull dull. Its only virtue lies in that it playes fast enough to be over with relatively quickly.

this is a fantastic game! There are so many different strategies that can be used on the way to victory or defeat. Either way your going to burn some grey matter. Everything works together in this game like gears to a machine and it's pretty damn impressive how it all somehow works so well together. Even if you have trouble figuring it all out at first, you will still stumble upon a boat load of points which will at least encourage you. This really is a masterpiece for those of us who appreciate great euro games. Also, it must be said. forget those opinions who smash this game because of lack of theme, please! Give me a break! It's full of theme and awesomeness. If all your looking for is theme than go play space hulk, which is good in it's own right but, not near as good a game. Trajan is a masterpiece and will eventually be in the top ten on the BGG.

I'm not a fan of the tile placement in Amerigo although I do like the action "cube" selection concept and Bora Bora whilst initially on my "wish list" soon fell off once the allure of its bright colours faded.

This game however retains my interest due to the theme, yes all games have theme even if its merely represented by board & card artwork, and the myriad of different options. The Mancala mechanism, for me, is also a bigger draw than Amerigo's quirky Cube Tower.

Still trying to "solve" this one but I do enjoy the play. Perhaps my approach is a little shotgun, but it's fun. Too complex for casual gamers.

The more I play this game, the more I like it. I can't keep it all in my head at once; I focus on one or two attacks and neglect the others (usually construction and trajan) so I'm still learning to balance.

I've reached the point where I can attack this game with full understanding of all the consequences. I'm still not great at it, but at least I'm confident in my choices. Still chasing skill and enjoying it.

Victory Point Salad, in grand Roman style.  The board is artfully split up into the various areas where you can and sometimes should participate: military conquest outside of Rome; building projects; religion; and others I no longer recall.

I recall enjoying the game, but it has been a rather long time since it has come to table. I need to rectify this, with the right group of people.

Stefan Feld VP salad game. There is a serious disconnect between the theme and mechanisms, but that doesn't bother me. Every damn thing you do gets you a point. Seriously. Again, it doesn't bother me but I can understand those who ARE bothered.

There are 6 different types of actions in the game, and there are many short-term and long-term ways to score points. These actions are chosen by moving stones around a mancala - sometimes you'll be unable to take the action you need, or you'll have to plan ahead and move your stones accordingly to ensure you get the action you need. There are also bonuses for using certain colors of stones to trigger certain actions. It's a handful and 100% an efficiency exercise. Just from reading this description, you'll know whether you'll like this or not.

I like this. My wife does too, and it takes us about 75 minutes to finish a game. I feel like adding more players only really adds more downtime, and it seems like 2 is best (though I haven't tried 3, the 4 player game had some downtime issues).

Gave this to Bryan.

Since [i]The Castles of Burgundy[/i] was such a success for us, trying another Stefan Feld design was inevitable. [i]Trajan[/i], while obviously a very good game, is not quite as engaging as [i]CoB[/i], missing the satisfying sense of ownership and gradual growth provided by the individual estate boards. 

The mancala wheel is an impressive mechanism though: it's very fun to puzzle out an effective sequence of moves on it. I also like having to deal with the demands of the people: in a game where every little thing gains victory points, it's refreshing to have to be mindful of losing them. [4 plays]

Yes, it's a point salad... it can be pretty cruel if you don't plan well, and that happened to me at the end of the game, I think this one feels pretty thematic (one of the biggest criticisms to Feld games is the lack of theme), I really Felt like a Roman that was trying to advance the prestige of Rome by building, conquering territories, trading and keeping the people happy!

The game is not hard, the rules are simple and well written, but despite not being hard is a complex game because you have to constantly evaluate what you want to do vs what you should be doing and planning 2 or 3 turns ahead, and that's not an easy task to perform...

Trajan has become a hit with my wife.  The presentation and artwork is very appealing and the game-play has a nice  open, non-confrontational flavor.  The open-ended scoring means you can always challenge yourself to get more and more points; making a nice rewarding, puzzly experience.

I fairly like Trajan, but no one else in my gaming group enjoys it.  Their complaint is that the six mini-games are too disconnected from each other, so it doesn't seem to matter much what you do.  All you do is pick points here, pick points there.  Since there's so much to do, there's no real blocking, competition or narrative.

It's a shame that it seems to lack development, lot's of choices and paths, but all of them give you points. In the end i just get bored and with no interest in following a strategy...

When you pick up the box you know instantly that this game means business. It is heavy as a brick and includes a ton of thick cardboard and beautiful wooden pieces. 

Set up can be a time consuming task because there are som many moving parts. Zip lock bags and little extra work in organizing when putting game pieces in box pay off when you plan to play Trajan again. 

Game has so many possibilities and so little time to do what you plan to do. Every sub-game in this game is a race where most points go to that player who does things first. 

Usually my heart skips beats and throat is dry when I am  constanly trying to find my wyliest move and at the same time plan few moves ahead. And while I am trying to get all the planets aligned time my counter players are doing what they can to beat me in my own goals. 

Mancala mechanic as an action selection tool is heat and soul of this game and is executed brilliantly. 

This game is perfect, for me at least.

Elcsábultam amint megláttam a minőségét, így megvettem. Este ki is próbáltuk. NAGYON JÓ játék. Persze én is látom, hogy sokaknak miért nem fog tetszeni. Kicsit lassú és körülményesnek is tűnhet első ránézésre. Ugyanakkor, folyamatos pozitív visszacsatolást kapsz játék közben, mivel nagyon sok helyen lehet tevékenykedni és pontokat szerezni benne. Jó előre meg kell tervezni, hogy mit akarsz csinálni a későbbi körökben. Ráadásul arra is figyelned kell, hogy a többiek milyen irányban mozognak, mit szeretnének  végrehajtani majd. Nem találkoztam még egy olyan játékkal, ahol ennyire kellett volna folyamatosan koncentrálni. Én pl. ezt nem bánom. Ahogy kipróbáltuk egyből beleszerettem.

This is a "nose down" game from start to finish, so I'm never going to be wild about it. 

That said, I liked it considerably more than any other nose-down Feld game I've played.

EDIT: Thinking about my first play some more [I guess that in itself is a good-ish sign], I think the fatal flaw here is that a lot of the mechanisms seem to have been added on for [i]no reason[/i] other than to add something to analyze [with no corresponding additional gameplay]. 

There's no reason, for instance, to have the color-matching requirement on the Trajan tiles. It's relatively easy, with sufficient analysis, to get all of your colors to line up in all of the right places at all of the right times. You don't miss activations except for not having analyzed.

There is no gameplay decisions / opportunity cost to be made in choosing how to distribute the colors. 

You can always make sure that everything gets activated. The entire mechanic should have been scrapped.

There should only be non-colored "beads" in the bins. All Trajan tiles should auto-activate when targeted.

Why? Because this is effectively what happens in the game anyway, given sufficient time for analysis.

After 1 play, I really like this game. It is like playing a whole series of different games in one - which I know some people will not like, as there are so many paths to gaining VPs. If you try to cover all posisble paths you will just end up confused, but pick on one or two particular paths and you can maximise your VP collection.
The Mancala style rondel mechanic is different and effective, providing you dont over analyse all possible moves and plan too far ahead as you will slow down the quite fast pace of the turns.
In summary I think this will be a love/hate Marmite game and for me it is tremendous.

After 3 plays I am becoming less convinced by this game. If played quickly it is tremendous..... But (and this is a very big BUT) if players spend too long analysing their moves them game becomes far too long, so be careful who you ah this with. I have adjusted my rating accordingly.

There's a level of disconnect for me with all the different moving pieces of this game.

The mancala model is an elegant and beautiful design that takes sometimes to get use to. But once you understand how it works, it's one of the best game ever. All paths lead to victory, no scripted play, the small amount of luck in what tiles showing up make every games different. This may feel like an exercise, but one I would not be tired of because you could never say you can master the mancala!

rating after first play, 4p, all noobs.

Very interesting game, the mancala makes it feel like a rondel-game,  which I also like. I love how there are 6 "mini-games" that you trigger with the mancala.
There is not much theme, but enough for me (knowing this is a Feld game). Especially Shipping and Legionnaire feel right.

Expect rating to go up after repeated plays.

First impression about the number-of-turns-issue: we think it's there. First player has the advantage of having first choice (obviously), but last player also has one turn less most of the games. This could mean up to 9 points (maybe even more with extra action-tiles etc). 

Will need more plays before deciding on house-ruling it or not (fe end game trigger stays same and everyone needs to fulfill the needs at that time, but the round continues afterwards so everyone gets equal # turns).

PS: game is not colorblind-friendly (had issues with the player colors, the trajan tiles and the mancala-hexagons) but was able to make it playable.

In this Roman themed game, each player has a "Mancala" board with 6 trays. You seed each tray with 2 cubes. Your turn first consists of moving cubes from one tray to another. Where the last cube ends up, you first check to see if you match the colors of a bonus tile. Afterwards, depending on which tray you landed at, you have one of 6 possible actions to take: adding another bonus tile, going to the forum to get tiles, going to the senate to earn VPs, army movement, construction movement and shipping. THe game is made up of four quarters. Each quarter, the people demand three of religion, bread or gladiator: if you don't meet some of these needs you lose VPs. So you have to consider if you want to meet these needs. 

This is a good game, and there are many strategic paths to choose. For instance, you could try to use a +2 token in the forum, or +2 in shipping, and so forth.You can't do everything, and there is tension on what you can do before your opponent can do it, but you can't be top dog everywhere. This is a good game, with many possibilities.

This game would get my vote for game of the year for 2012.

[b]Mechanics: 5/5[/b] None of the mechanics are special on their own. If you really look at each of the actions as they are, they're really basic and boring.

The mancala isn't original either. BUT, the way these things weave together, along with the Trajan tiles, the bonus actions, and the time track, shoots these individually mediocre mechanisms into something that is nothing short of absolute genius. The mechanics make this game. I honestly think the fact that the individual mechanics are so simple and uninspired makes it even better, because it would take something spectacular to turn these into something fun, thought provoking and interesting. And Stefen Feld achieved it with flying colors.

[b]Art: 3/5[/b] The game really does look pretty drab, but it's thematic. The personal board looks like an ancient roman tablet. The artwork on the tiles and cards is serviceable, but it is nothing to write home about. It's all pretty bland looking, but it doesn't cross the line into bad territory.

[b]Scoring: 4/5[/b] I'm learning lately that point salads aren't my thing, which is ironic considering the fact I purchased a point salad microbadge. It seems like everything that you do gives you points, and it's difficult to conjure up ways to take the best move. Construction seems overpowered 90% of the time, but sometimes it gets setup in a way that keeps it from being too strong. End game scoring is usually pretty annoying to me in most games if it isn't just a single scoring objective like in Troyes, but you have a lot of control of who gets what tiles if you're willing to spend actions getting votes. I have, many a time, blocked my opponents from getting tiles they would obviously want by disregarding all other actions to get votes in the senate either through tiles, or through actually taking the senate action. This contrasts well with drafting end game scoring tiles/cards, because it adds another layer of strategy, forcing you to decide if the end game scoring tiles are worth fighting for, when there are so many other things that can net you a good chunk of points as well.

[b]Luck: 3/5[/b] Overall, this game is really good with keeping luck to a minimum. But the whole mechanic around the shipping actions is somewhat luck based, and that's really awkward in a game that otherwise has near-perfect information and a way to plan from the very beginning how you want to play. 

Also, each turn, when setting up pieces on the provinces, sometimes someone will get a tile that is without a doubt perfect for the situation placed right next to their legionnaire. Usually these are either senate votes or demand tiles for the last round. So, if your legionnaire is on the other side of the map from your opponents, and the demand tiles flips to show that the citizens want bread, and the only bread on the entire board after the forum and provinces are filled is next to your opponent... yeah... it sucks when people get advantages like that especially in games like this that almost seem like peak potential games in terms of outplay potential.

In most games, this amount of luck would probably only drop it to a 4/5 rating, but because of how much planning and strategy go into the remainder of this game, these problems actually hurt the game more than they would many others.

[b]Fiddliness: 3/5 [/b] This dropped the games rating from a 9 to an 8 on a recent play. I wish people could keep track of the time track on their own turn, but that never happens. You have one person who will be keeping track of the time marker, but that means they can never get even a little distracted. Every turn, having to refill the forum can also kill a bit of the flow. Otherwise, it's not too fiddly, but these things are kind of a problem.

Conclusión: 
Es un juego con los que el Sr. Feld a mí me cautivó. El impresionante sistema del mancala hace disfrutar mucho de este juego.

El poco azar, junto con las mecanicas de colocación de trabajadores, colección de token, draft de cartas a la vez que coordinando las acciones con el mancala hacen un juego sesudo y divertido por partes iguales.

En cuanto a los aspectos negativos, cabe mencionar que es un juego con falta de gancho. Se puede quedar un poco frío. En el Bora Bora, juego que bebe del Trajan, la temática y colorines le hacen mas atractivo.

En todo caso para mi es un imprescindible en cualquier ludoteca que se precie.

RATING: 5.5
The first time I played it, I found it so clever and wonderful. The second time I played it, I thought it didn't replay well; it felt like a retread. I'll have to play again to discern whether that disappointment had to do with novelty value being so integral to my enjoyment the first time, not differentiating my gameplay sufficiently relative to the first play, or having a harder go of it the second time (I had won my first game on the back of lucky replenishment draws for Trajan tiles, in the marketplace [or whatever it's called], and in the red tiles.) It may also have to do with the limited role of randomization, said as a lover of Castles of Burgundy and Macao and militant detester of In the Year of the Dragon.

after a long break (~2 years), sadly have to report that the rating is unchanged. The game is a collection of  mini-games with not enough glue. There are parts that are quite fun, the sensation of which rubs off after a play. Plus the chore-work of moving the time indicator each turn is easy to neglect.

RATING: 6
After an overwhelming and not very impressive first play, the mechanics of this game seem to me a little disjointed. It feels like the mancala movement was a basic idea and it was surrounded by scoring opportunities. Many repeat plays are necessary to see whether there are viable strategies in this seemingly patched up game. I am not sure I want to make the effort. (On the positive side, with three players, the game was reasonably fast - shorter than 2 hours)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Feels overly convoluted. I don't think there is a way to maximize the power of mancala; at least for me, that is. There is just so much stuff packed in Trajan, that it feels you get left out something every time you play it. It's not bad by any means, there's just much better and more streamlined games in my collection that I want to play.

RATING: 7
Typically Feldian euro. The mancala is really interesting and thought-provoking and is basically the meat of the game. The Trajan tiles which also make you consider mancala colours are a nice touch and keep you on your toes.

On the other hand, it disturbs me that there is basically no relation whatsoever between the six "mini-games". I don't mind a good point salad, but I prefer there to be some interconnection between options - so that they improve each other - rather than just a bunch of separate things. It's sometimes said that "there's a lot going on, but it hangs together well". In this case, there's a lot going on, and it doesn't hang together at all!

The theme's also pasted on, but that's not a big deal for me.

Ultimately, it seems that the underlying current to Feld's games is that they are one innovative and interesting element mixed with a bunch of standard stuff, which saddens me somewhat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I have heard wonders about Trajan and I'm a Feld fan. But maybe it was because I didn't read the rules (I just watched a quick instructional video), maybe because the games were slow, maybe because I was played 3 games them at the same time, maybe it was because I expected too much, but my impression was not very positive. The sensations were similar to Bora Bora, different things to score, with some "cheap" minor relationship between them and the only cool thing is the mancala mechanism to choose actions.

The theme is zero. Those who say there's theme in these game certainly have very low standards.

For sure, it is a good game, it works very well, it seems to be balanced and you can think as much as you want planning multiple plays ahead. But it doesn't arouse my interest as much as other Feld games.

I've played several times. I won some games, and performed quite bad at others, but I can't really tell what I did well and what wrong, why I won, or what costed me the game. I don't know what to do in order to perform better, etc. It's a sensation I had with other games and I never liked it.

Does this disqualify me as Feld fan? :whistle:

First impression (4 players): Again one Feld game I like but which seems to be a bit too long when played with my regular group (Luna was the previous one). Luckily we didn't start to analyze too much what other players are (efficiently) wanting to do with their actions as even optimizing your own couple of next turns so that you do trajan tiles while doing what you want takes time. Have to say I like the action selection mechanic works but it also adds plenty of AP in worst cases.

Feels like you are putting an expensive race-car to the test. So many interconnected mechanisms, and all of them make sense in the context of all the others. The way the punishments works makes sense -- the demand of the Roman populace -- and that demand drives the game. However, your open victory point chits can make you zig away from meeting the demand, if you can work toward them and make more points than you lose due to demand.

The mancala = what action you take is brilliant. Can back you into a corner, so plan accordingly.

Love the way you need to concentrate on 2 of the 6 areas to win. Specializing in 1 is a good way to lose, but in style. Generalizing in 5+ areas is a certain path to destruction, as you never seem to get the good stuff in specific areas; however, you can still muck up others' plans by taking a tactical move in one of those places you do not plan on devoting a lot of time on. This is a game about picking the time & place of your battles, which is quite appealing.

RATING: 7
The mancala system, combined with the round timer, is devious but the rest of the game is just a bunch of arbitrary ways of collecting bonus tiles, and takes a lot longer than it should. It does not really help that paying attention to what the other players are doing is of little importance.

RATING: 7.5
A swathe of mini games all tied together with a mancala action selection device. Wrangling with the mancala device is the best part of the game – get that part tied up and you’ll have a good chance at scoring points from mini games – sorry, I mean scoring lots points from the mini games, as virtually everything you do will score you points – whether it’s from the point track, the point map, the point tiles, the other point tiles or from the point cards. Playing this game feels like your shovelling coal to power a steam engine – you need to keep shovelling to keep moving along the point track. Stop shovelling and you’ll coast along, still picking up points, but you’ll fall behind and won’t have a big enough head of steam to race to victory at the end. 

I think it has a Roman theme...

RATING: 9
Boasting a plethora of material and not as much innovation in mechanics by themselves as in the combination of known procedures, Trajan is an epitomic German board game: players aim for success (scoring) balancing military campaigns, gathering influence at the Senate, keeping commerce lively, building, selecting bonus actions to achieve and browsing for the right opportunity at the forum. Each of these actions is like a little drafting game on its own; all of them are linked by a Mancala-style wheel to determine the next mini-game to play and trigger extra actions and by common tiles appearing on several different mini-games. The game is structured in four trimesters; at the end of each players must have gathered several special chips (in the sense of feeding) to avoid penalties.

Even though an actual move is just choosing one pit in the wheel, sowing and carrying out the respective action(s), the six mini-games have their own intricacies, choosing which one to play isn't trivial at all since there are many paths to the win and being able to play the wished sequence of mini-games at all (let alone trigger extra actions) demands extremely judicious use of the wheel. Even though a new player can easily understand how to move, grasping the relationship between all the layers in the game takes repeated playing. 

Trajan is a complex, rotund game, with just indirect interaction to keep a fine balance between strategy and tactics. For players of abstract games or family games it will feel like too much of a chunk. For enthusiasts of Eurogames, it will be a joy to play eight games at once.

RATING: 8
Il gioco gira intorno al meccanismo del mancala. Stefan Feld, che non si è mai distinto per giochi ben ambientati, propone un giocone con meccaniche riuscite e ambientazione nulla. Insieme a Bora Bora e In the year ofthe Dragon, Trajan è al momento il suo gioco più complesso e permette ai giocatori di scegliere ad ogni turno tra sei differenti azioni. L'originalità del titolo sta proprio nel fatto che le azioni scelte possono essere eseguite solo se l'ultimo cubetto del mancala termina sopra il movimento prescelto. In virtù di questo riuscito meccanismo Trajan offre una buona interazione e la necessita al tempo stesso di fare un'attenta programmazione. Durante la partita si avrà la tendenza a specializzarsi in qualche settore del tabellone: battaglia, commercio, senato, manodopera. Non ci sono particolari tempi morti (salvo pensatori troppo fini) ma spesso si rischia di concentrarsi solo sul proprio mancala perdendo di vista l'andamento delle plance degli altri giocatori. Personalmente trovo molto bella la prospettiva del tabellone che mostra una visione dell'Europa partendo dal Senato di Roma.

Abstract Euro with a pasted-on theme.  Doesn't mean that its bad or anything, but don't expect some kind of "Roman" or "political" game out of this.

I like the various paths to scoring, the constant worry about the senate vote, the pressure to take actions to score vs. actions to prevent losing points and the never enough time to do everything you want.  I like that it takes time to understand basic strategies/tactics.

Most people I have played with seem to like it, so I wont be getting rid of it.  Personally, I don't really enjoy it - maybe because its got such a mess of things going on?  Maybe its because there is virtually no engine to construct?  Not 100% sure why, but it does feel like a bit of a mess of a game.  I come to these feelings after 9 plays of this game.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I managed to get a second play in at TotalCon this year and loved it. I have played a lot of Feld's and this is one of my favorites (CoB being the other). Of the games I've played that riff on the mancala I like how Trajan does it best (I've also played 5 Tribes and Staufer Dynasty). 

I love the way I am forced to think in this game; there is a spacial puzzle to the mancala wheel that you really need to wrap your mind around and it hits a sweet spot for me.

The only reason Trajan's not in my collection is that this game not only demands a lot of forward planning, you also have to manipulate the mancala in order to be able to select the actions you want (usually for multiple turns in a row). Trajan is too much of a brain burner to be enjoyed by my wife and kids, but I'm hopeful that I'll get to play more since one of my gaming buddies loves Trajan.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (n/a):[/COLOR]

[i]I really enjoyed this game, but unfortunately I can not imagine anyone in my family wanting to play this. The multiple ways to score points in conjunction with managing your mancala would probably even overwhelm my son. The guys I played with played at a brisk pace, but I can see this game inducing AP in lots of people. I would love to play Trajan again.[/i]

RATING: 6.5
The most laborious and unnecessarily complex of Feld's games. As always with his games, Feld has a collection of victory point salad mechanics with tiles, tokens, and cards with absolutely no relationship to its theme. And, as always, there just isn't enough time or turns to do what you want! Which is actually kind of genius. Anyways, Trajan's central mechanic is mancala or a version of it; the last space you dropped a token in is the action you take which can be maddening because, for a couple of turns, it's possible that you can't take the action you need because your tokens aren't arranged that way. It would be pointless! Fruitless! Brainless to even suggest a long-term strategy for this game; you would go cross-eyed with the attempt. The trick is to strategize a move or two ahead and you'll end up better than most. For my taste, I would prefer Bora Bora or Castles of Burgundy. Save Trajan for those who care about the tortures of mancala.

It's a bit of a beast to learn how to tame and do well in. Which of course is majorly attractive, and different enough from other games out there that it has ongoing replay appeal solely for that reason. The trick it seems is specialising in a few of the 6 actions, but the game makes it challenging to achieve that through the clever use of its mancala mechanic. Each action score points in a different way, mainly via different set collections. The trick is working out how to manage your Mancala board so as to repeatedly hit the actions that you're wanting to specialise in so as to earn the bonuses for major set collection prowess. There's also the constant allure of earning bonus Trajan tiles, which you earn while you're doing other stuff by managing to get your Mancala cubes spread about the board in particular ways. All of which induces pleasant agony for some, but you can easily see how it would be considered mindblowingly dull analysis paralysis in others. A game that's not for the faint-hearted, but offers rich reward for those who enjoy managing the option maze.

A lot going on. Perhaps Feld's heaviest Euro. A collage of mechanisms that work together to produce quite a game. The Mancala-style action-selection mechanism is used in place of dice and worker placement, and it works well; please understand that Trajan is NOT "Mancala: The Board Game".

As as beautiful and well-designed this is, the theme/story doesn't come out enough for me, making this feel more mechanically abstract than fun.

What I like:
- Mancala is clever and interesting
- Not a lot of conflict

What I don't like:
- There is just too much going on in the game
- Strong "point salad" feel, with points everywhere
- Shipping seems weak unless you get good cards

After our 2-hour game with 3 first-timers, we all felt like it took more like 3 hours. It is a brain-burner, although it moved along pretty briskly. I think the BGG-voted weight of 3.6 is about right.

After first try, a three player game: 

This is my kind of game, but Stefan Feld's games usually are. I have read complaints about a mismatch of mechanics and a very loosely added theme. I don't mind much about the connection between theme and mechanics. The theme is there as decoration. The mix of many mechanics suits me well. I like when you can chose different paths and many different strategies can win. All mechanics seem very well balanced. 

The only slightly negative thing is that there are so many things to do and different strategis to chose that there aren't that much competition for different things. You can always choose your own path and be left quite alone to follow it, at least in a three player game.

There are so many ways to get points. You move your pieces around a roundel mancala style and where you land determines your action, but there are so many other options. You must move your players to locations, collect groups of tiles, meet the people's demand and more. Once you get the hang of it, it plays fairly well, but to optimize your points is tough as there are a lot of things going on. Some player interaction, but mainly you focus on your own thing, especially in your first few plays.

RATING: 6.5
Definitely a game I do not mind playing from time to time but have absolutely no desire to own and am glad I never made the decision to pull the trigger and actually purchase.  Yes, the mancala mechanic players use to choose actions is very clever and fun to manipulate, but the rest of the game is a disjointed mess.  The "military" action in this game has been the brunt of a few jokes and deservedly so as it is quite anemic to be considered "military".  The game requires you to diversify a bit and specialize in 2 or 3 areas.  It seems to me that you have to completely ignore at least one of the "mini games" in order to do well, otherwise you are spreading yourself too thin.  So the game really is optimizing a spreadsheet.  There are games I enjoy that feature the same thing, but to me Trajan is so disjointed that I never feel like I am doing anything more than a spreadsheet.  I will play it again at some point, but it will never be a game I seek to play.

With Trajan, Feld gives us another interesting new mechanic to enjoy: a mancala-like action-selection wheel that seems like a cross between Finca and Goa.  The game features a number of diverse point-gathering strategies (some of which work together better than others), allowing players to specialize to a degree.  You don't really have full control of what actions you take, so you end of doing some of everything, though.  What really makes the game interesting is the Trajan tiles, which stipulate that if you get certain combination of specific action markers (which are colored only for this purpose) in certain spots, you'll get big bonuses, like free actions or lots of points.  This aspect of the game encourages you to ignore which actions you're taking, and instead plan ahead two or three turns in advance to try to scoop up those Trajan bonuses.  Of course, it's best if you can make your action strategy and your Trajan strategy line up, but that's quite a feat.

Mancala-driven action selection mechanism is cool;  A nice game that is reasonably easy to explain (just don't learn from the rules), while being rather complex.  Lots of different paths to victory. A little worried about the variance induced by the sacrifice disks (we house ruled that one of each is removed) in relation to the effort to set up the Trajan-tile based method for meeting this demand.  Also concerns that you can just draw cards very poorly / well & this really alters the game a lot.  Not for the AP prone.

Initially I thought this game was quite heavy. The mancala blew my mind and you have a million things you want to do. After a few more games of it, I realized it probably falls under a medium weight category. The production value is outstanding and the gameplay is unique and interesting. Lots to think about and lots to do. I like it better with more players, but I think it plays extremely well across all player counts. Looking forward to more plays of it.

Extras: Cards sleeved in FFG sleeves as well as a Meeple Realty insert. Meeple Realty insert only marginally cuts down on time of setup. Not a strong recommendation of the insert.

Trajan have been critizized for lacking in theme, that the theme is thin even for a Euro. I don't agree at all. Euros like Endeavour and Felds own Macao have - to name a few - much more artificial feel to it.

I actually think that the theme works pretty good! Just like with Village, Trajan arguable consists of a couple of "mini-games". But Trajan does this so much better and gels everything together nicely.

Anyhow, Trajans greatest asset is superior gameplay and tons of replayability.

Artwork on the board is somewhat crude and old-school looking, but clear and functional.

Very good first impression and it only got better with repeated play.

Players are faced with a typical Feldian dilemma: there's a lot of stuff to do but, at the same time, their actions are constrained by some strange and opaque mechanic (in this case, the mancala-rondel, or whatever people call it these days). 

But Trajan's central mechanic is truly inspired and it makes the game work. Not only managing the mancala is a fun game in itself, but the clever ways in which it affects the other game elements (the timer, the tiles, etc) are very well thought out.  

Trajan is a very unique and interesting game and it may well be Stefan Feld's masterpiece.

RATING: 9
This game is crazy! This is by far the heaviest Feld I have tried. The sandboxy nature of this game is the reason why you will be scratching/nodding/shaking your head multiple times during the game. There are only 6 actions in this game but a few sub-actions under each one. Not to mention that these actions are activated only when you place a marker on the specific space of the rondel. So no marker on rondel = no activation for that action. Careful planning of your marker placements are essential to pull off some amazing combos. Not to mention that the game does not have a set specific amount of turns you will have as this is determined by the players' actions. 
The reviews are right about this. It is really a multiplayer solitaire and a lot of people do not like it due to the sandbox nature of it. A 4p game is better as it mitigates the sandbox nature, limiting the actions you can optimally perform. This reminds me of that tight gameplay feeling evident in Bora Bora. My first 2p game lasted two hours and a 4p game finished in about the same time. The board does not change with lower player counts except for the forum section and time tracker so at 2p, I feel the board is really open and causes players to be AP prone. Still fun with the different player counts. This game is all about manipulating the rondel on your player board and it is so much fun when you see the action on your player board translate into the main board followed by some "Damn you! I was going to do that next!". 
Trajan is solitaire done right. I foresee this being a favourite of mine.

17/9 - No longer a favourite. Bora Bora in terms of Felds.

I got to play this game at my local board game meetup. It was fun, and I didn't expect this game to weight 3.6 on BGG scale. Maybe I am already tuned into the Feld's system that the experience with Castle of Burgundy that I have helped me in understand the mechanics. I feel right at home. The only complicated part is the action turn mechanic thing. I couldn't chain things as well as I'd like. I can see this game's rating go up if I have more plays. Right now it sits at a 7.

---- Update ----
I got 2 plays of 2-player under my belt after getting this game in the math trade. All I can say is now I am more accustomed to heavier euros and I did enjoy my plays. Rating 7 -> 8. 

---- Update ----
After another play this has jump yet another rating level for me. 8 -> 9. After I can see how I can do combos in this game this has become very intense and fun.

This game is so busy and somewhat action-salad-esque that it should drive me nuts in the same way that I found Dungeon Petz & LeHavre too busy. 

But somehow, Trajan is just so fun. The mancala is an inspiration in that it is a game in and of itself, and also because it removes the luck of cards & dice for driving action. Sure, the set cards and tile placements can randomly benefit one player or the other from time to time, but manipulating the mancala allows a player to find a path that matches their strategy and think as many turns in advance as they are capable. Love that.

Very thin on theme but saved by the mancala mechanism and there always appears to be options for scoring points.

RATING: 2
Ok, so this game probably should be a 7 but it didn't appeal to me on the first play and whilst I would agree that I might "get it" if played several times, the group that has a copy is a "cult of the new" group so we'd be lucky to play it more than once per year and I'd need to play it 4 or more times in a month to understand the strategy to the point that I was not just making random moves for most of the game.
It does not help that this not one game but several linked by the mancala (they are certainly not linked by the theme).
Best play seems to be to choose one of the games and play it solitaire.
For comparison, I like Tigris and Euphrates but I haven't played it for a long time - I don't want to play T&E again because it would spoil the memory but when we played it a lot I liked it. If I was to play T&E for the first time, I'd probably rate that a 2 as well.
Conclusion: if this is the only game you buy in 2012, you might like it a lot. If you already have a dozen games in your suitcase and a dozen great games at home then leave it on the Essen stand where you saw it.

It's an engrossing game with a simple and cool set of mechanics and a good number of ways to victory. In fact, I've been surprised at how victory was achieved the last couple times I've played. What keeps it from being truly great is that it's incredibly unintuitive. The theme really is pretty tacked on here, and it's so abstract that I feel I'm just being manipulated to jump through hoops for the designer.

Won my first game against some who had played before, but am completely unsure as to why.  Mancala action mechanism is supercool!  But, for me, and after just one play, there are just too many different ways to score.  If they all held together in a compelling metaphor, I would have an easier time getting it.  But it almost seems as if Feld's made a game for gamers who delight only in grasping and tweaking scoring systems.  Admittedly, I tend to go for lighter (Castles of Burgundy works well for me), and more theme-heavy, fare.  Games like this, and Troyes, where the metaphor just doesn't work for me, start feeling like homework.

RATING: 7.5
Definitely a game that heavily incentivizes planning ahead. In order to get the most from your actions, you have to really think about how the mancala-style action mechanic works. This can lead to performing actions in a seemingly strange order for the sole purpose of preparing for a single action. Great mental gymnastics and it's a great feeling when you can get some synergy going.

Another interesting aspect of the game is the time track, and how each player gets a say in how the game is paced. There can be certain situations where you can't do the action you want because it would trigger the end of a season and you're not quite ready for that. Conversely there may be times when you don't do the action you want and trigger a season end because you realize that other players are not prepared. This further adds to the things that need to be considered and planned for on your turn. Wonderful game if you want to practice thinking ahead.

Another excellent Feld design.  The action selection mechanic is unique and fascinating.  There is tons to explore about this game and enough changes from turn to turn (and thus game to game) to keep the replayability high.  An excellent Euro, and a game I see myself playing for a long time to come.

RATING: 9
I've had this on my wishlist for years and finally got to play it. Fantasic!
Okay, now clearly this is a game which will only appeal to a certain audience of gamers, but fortunately for me I'm in that category. It's a solid euro.

Mechanic - Card collection and personal action strategy. The mancala system really deepens the planning of your future turns.

Chance - There's a small bit with the card drawing and the peoples' demands but overall, it's pretty low.

Complexity - Not for casual gamers but once you're familiar with the basic actions you rarely need to consult the rules. Mastery though can take many plays.

Interaction - Moderate, but definitely there. I've heard some say the game is like solitare, but that's not true. Meeting the peoples' demands requires players to fight to grab resources before they're all taken up. Also, you can force the end of a "quarter year" (why they don't just call it a season is beyond me) by dumping a really long mancala cell and making the time counter spin past the end of the round. You also fight heavily for those senate bonuses. So yeah, there is definitely interaction.

Theme - I call it a "flat theme": the theme is strong but not dynamic. I've heard people say there's no theme and others say there is. I think the difference is just that the theme DOES fit the game well, it just doesn't change as the game progresses, so it might not "come alive" in that sense. For me, I do feel the ancient Roman atmosphere while playing, so there is a thematic atmosphere.

Components - Fine. It's nothing to rave about but it's not cheap.

Game Length - They say 30 mins/player and I think that's probably pretty close to accurate, depending on how deeply players spend calculating their moves on their turns. The first game does take some extra time to get the rules down but subsequent games should be much quicker.

Overall, one of my favorite games.

Wonderful Feld game. One of my top favorites of his titles. Lots of different avenues to pursue and focus on. I love the mancala like mechanic of dropping the tokens in the bowls to select your actions for the turn and thus pushing the game further along. It is very clever and there are a lot of things to consider. Definitely recommend this one.

RATING: 7
Trajan is a tough game to rate, after my first play. I like games with strong central mechanisms, and like most Feld games, this is a collection of minigames with a million ways to score points. It's a puzzle game and a points optimizing game, something I usually dislike.

The game is held together by the Mancala mechanism, which really is 80% of the game. It makes choosing what to do very, very complex. And I'm not sure if I like that. Trajan isn't about choosing option A or B, since A obviously scores more points than B, but it's about gettting that damn mancala to work for you so you can actually perform option A when you want to. 

It's pretty gamey. It feels like complexity for complexity's sake. "Here you have some trivial minigames, now go through this tricky machine to do what you want to do." But that's not really being fair to the game. The Mancala puzzle is really interesting, it forces you to plan ahead and think about how the board will look after your actions. And the minigames do have just enough timing issues and interactivity and planning ahead to be more than just picking the one that gives the most points every time. 

You might want to build to take a tile now, before anyone else gets it, but you really want to go to the forum first, so you can get two extra build actions and take more tiles. But if you go to the forum, the stones in your mancala cups will change in such a way that you can't take the build action next turn. Are you ok with another turn setting it up? Those decisions are more interesting than any I've seen in other Feld games, as other factors than just optimizing points/action come into play.

So, I'm chalking the feeling of spending more time and energy figuring out the overly complex mancala than reacting to what goes on on the board and with the other players up to inexperience. I can see it becoming easier and more fluid with more plays, when I have a better idea of what is important in the order and spread of the colored stones and what I don't need to spend my mental energy on. I do have some nagging doubts that the game is too heavy for its own good, and that it doesn't have enough to offer other than the complex puzzle. I'll have to find out with more plays, but it's certainly interesting enough that I can see my rating going up a bit. I am, however, not really looking forward to playing it often; it's just too convoluted to get me enthusiastic. A 7, for now.

This game is interesting and super frustrating to play. Getting the action pegs to line up to take the actions you want to take requires a lot of forethought. The extra actions mechanics make this even more frustrating when you see other players pull of moves that let them do a lot in the same turn. The different action regions aren't of equal value, so knowing that is important. It also has a 'feed your forces' mechanic each round to bring in some of that Agricola inspired frustration. Despite this all, I like the game. Somewhere between all that frustration there are a lot of little aspects to the game I enjoy. The thing that lets the negative aspects outshine the good aspects is how each area of the board has nothing to do with the others, making the game feel very empty.

We enjoyed playing Trajan. I would have no problem playing it again. My beefs with this game are the pasted on theme and lack of interaction between players. I can't complain heavily though because I was aware of these traits before I purchased it. There also doesn't appear to be much tying together the separate areas of the board accept where the Senate is concerned. This has been my first Feld game and the mancala is where all the fun is at. I can enjoy multi-player solitaire games but I do miss a more immersive theme. Whether this sticks around remains to be seen. I'll admit it. I got sucked into the so-called dreaded Cult of the New.

Have only played this one solo - playing two sides at the same time. Need to get a few more games in before I can manage to get good strategies going for both sides I think. Or look around for a real solo variant. Seems like a fun game with a fun rondel mechanism. Components aren't pretty in my opinion, but ok.

Been playing this one a lot lately, still solo-ing two-player games. There's a lot to explore and figure out, and a lot of little puzzles to try to solve. So far I almost never know beforehand which of the two players will win until all points have been counted at the end of the game.

At first, It might seem like a lot happening at the same time (it is difficult to manipulate your own board, let alone look at other's moves) but one gradually gets the hang of it and then the game is wonderful. Multiple ways of winning, everything gives you points so it has a slight feel good factor.

There is a Lot going on in the Victory point salad. Interesting trying to balance your movement of action pawns to set up the worker actions you want to try. I like how many are 2 phased needing a set up as well as an execution.
I agree with some others some actions seem to be much better than others. However, there is enough going on to give you a bunch of different things to try. It is fun to try to chain bonuses. The game has a lot of moving parts in that there is a lot to keep track, as such it is hard to get started.

Perhaps the best game I've played this year. Reminds me quite a bit of Castles of Burgundy except the mechanics make a lot more sense to me here. Everything just flows and makes a 2 hour game seem like it takes half the time.

All the different actions seem very balanced. Chaining actions is key to victory and you'll know you didn't plan well if you perform only one action on a turn. Nearly everything rewards points, so make sure you build towards a powerful end game bonus.

Overall: Just all around excellent. Feld's greatest achievement in my opinion.

Great game.  Using a Mancala to select actions is an interesting mechanic.  6 different actions each of which provides VPs means many potential strategies to try out. There is quite a bit going on, but it is not a complex game.  The rules are a very quick read and easy to understand.

RATING: 5
A typical Feld-Point-Salad. There are a bunch of different things you can do, but all feel like little mini games with slightly different mechanisms. Since the game is well balanced, I suspect many strategies could work easily and you have a good chance of winning, if no opponent tries to  do the same.

The central mechanism of Trajan is the Mancala action selection. It is really something different, but it is really abstract and leads to a complete disconnect of theme and mechanics. I am rather luke warm on Trajan, since this is basically about who can solve the puzzle of the Mancala most effectively and interaction is reduced to snatching away the limited bonus tiles. Trajan shares with Castles of Burgundy the lack of focus and that almost any strategy yields about the same amount of points. But this makes the game somewhat arbitrary.

THE OPPOSITE OF ELEGANT
Provisional rating after one play.  Lots of unrelated subsystems connected by mancala inspired personal rondel mechanic.  To me this game is an example of an unfortunate trend of taking a bunch of mechanics, cubes, tiles, and cards, tossing them into a blender, punching the frappe button and dumping them on a quasi historical map.  Voila, euro-barf!  I didn't find that the theme helped me connect to the gameplay.  That said there is lots to think about, plenty of decisions, and numerous (I think) strategies to explore.  If you enjoy simultaneously operating multiple subsystems this could be a good game for you.  I'm glad to have tried it but I'm not sure this game is really worth the effort.  Sometimes less is more - time to dig out Tigris & Euphrates.

Most comments are negative but some still rate it above 3 - perplexing.

To paraphrase a popular lament of every Latin student...

The Trajan game is dead

Fantastic game.  Picked it up in a trade at GenCon 2012.  4 games played so far and I can't wait to play it again.

Update Nov. 2012: Feld becomes a favorite designer after now playing Trajan, Notre Dame, Castles of Burgundy, Macao and The Speicherstadt (with its expansion or else not so great). Trajan continues to be terrific, but your brain needs to be ready and the set-up does take a while.  I think it'll end up a solid 9 for me.

While I love many of Feld's games, I find this one to be one of his very best - which is high praise indeed. The mancala mechanic is obviously the main "gimmick" of this game, and on the first few plays it looks like it's been rather pasted on to a fairly standard Eurogame, or even an unrelated set of such games. But after more plays, one realises that this is not true - every action can affect every other, due to forum tiles picked up via the forum or military, or bonus tiles from the senate which could require you to do almost anything else in the game to get points from them. And the mancala - together with the Trajan tiles, which between them affect all of the other actions - is what ties this all together, requiring very careful planning so that you can take the actions you want to when you want (not to mention trying to control the timing of the game). It is a brilliant design that rewards repeated plays. The only thing that prevents me rating this higher than 8 is that it is really a brain burner (one of the most the most brain-burny game I own, and I like brain burners), and there are gamers I know who I would prefer not to play this against.

(+) The mancala rondel is brilliant!
(+) Did I mention the mancala rondel is utterly fascinating?
(+) Have I allready stated the mancala rondel is strangely addictive?
(+) Mancala ... rondel... *drool*

(-) Some minor concern about starting player having statistically more actions than other players. In a close game this can be significant.
(-) Next to the mancala rondel however, there unfortunately still is the rest of the game(board), which consists of a dozen of not very interesting mini-games.

This is such a shame! Why didn't Stefan feld include such a brilliant Mancala mechanism in a game like Castles of Burgundy to create one of the ultimate "best ever made" games? Now I feel like the mancala rondel is sort of 'wasted' to a set of uninteresting mini-games. I hope Feld or another game designer will recycle the mechanism and combine it with a better game in the future. Still, it's fair to say those mini games interconnect elegantly as far as gameplay is concerned and together they make for an interesting game.

(-) game lacks a story and has a very low 'fun-factor': players play individually and the rondel keeps everybody rather quiet and occupied.

It has a lot of mini-games / plate-spinning (not unlike Bora Bora). I really like the mancala mechanism. I like it better than Bora Bora mainly because, to me, it has less direct conflict than Bora Bora and is a touch less stressful (in Bora Bora I feel compelled at times to do all my tasks).

RATING: 7
Players can opt for several general ideas as to how to accumulate points - emphasize the military or perhaps the construction.  Or is it shipping or perhaps the VP tiles? And there is enough routes available that one generally doesn't feel locked out on any given turn - there will always be something one can achieve.  Which in turn suggests a game that plays more tactically than strategically.  Scores seem to be very close (5 points between first and last) but is this because the game has so many options that one can't block other players?

The mancala is a novel device which will take a bit of time to get used to but by the end of the first game one should easily be seeing how to play the next few moves without messing up the bit counts as the prior turns are played out.

A collage of euro mechanics stringed together with an ingenious, mancala mechanic to select your actions. I enjoyed playing Mancala with my family on vacations growing up, and the tactics involved in Mancala meshes quite well with the rest of the game.

Trajan tends to be a bit of a solitaire game, but you will have plenty of opportunities to prioritize certain actions to block or cutoff your opponents throughout the game while benefiting yourself. Many people refer to Trajan, and many other of Feld's games, to be a 'Point Salad' but this isn't exactly a deterrent for me. Is it you for?

OMG fun! My wife and I love this game. Players use a rondel to take various actions such as gaining prestige in the Senate, conquering neighboring territories, constructing buildings in Rome, shopping in the Forum or shipping goods to neighboring lands. Lots of choices will present players with lots of avenues to victory. An extremely well designed and enjoyable game that plays great with any number of players.

RATING: 6.5
The mancala-like mechanic around the rondel is a pretty fresh mechanic, but the action you then take are just a mish mash of different ways to get victory points, which while some do interact with each other, there is no even attempt to paste on a theme and in the end it's just not very fun.

Not bad, but this game seems a bit uninspired and comes dangerously close to being bland. A typical euro with a ton of things going on at the same time, and nearly all actions lead to some amount of victory points. It boils down to who can manage their mancala trays the best. The mancala element is novel, but does little to spice up this pedestrian effort from Feld. A solid "6.5" and another half point for the great art and production values.

Like many Felds, this feels more like a series of puzzles, than a game sometimes, but they are pretty decent puzzles. This might be the most puzzley yet. It lives and dies on its mancala mechanism and it is not unusual so see every player quietly staring at their mancala for the entire game, trying to figure out ever more efficient moves. 

The rest of the game is a bunch relatively uninteresting mini games that don't feel really that connected, but the central mechanism really pulls it all together.

RATING: 7.5
This game is really good. Yes, it's very dry and it's difficult to feel a senator when almost everything you do gets you points and nothing else, but the art is quite good and it's sufficient to feel the flavor a little more. The Mancala mechanic is a bit irritating sometimes, expecially if you "give up" about it and just get what you can with the simplest moves, but with a bit of experience it becomes easier to manage, which in turn makes any game better cause, simply but, Trajan tiles and additional actions, and on a minor side managing the pace of the game by moving (or not) the right amount of tokens, are absolutely essential to win.

What makes this game a little boring is the painstackingly long setup, with all those tiles you have to order, mix, turn over and then put in the right place, while order, mix and turn over the others you will have to put in later, and the ones you will have to remove. Since the tiles are not random at all, and it's vital for all of them to be used only once and then removed if not picked, it's very easy to mess things up. Also, it's a rare game the one where you don't have to check the rules over and over, cause they are very detailed and full of minutae, and not very intuitive after all, expecially the ones involving the cards. Also again, it's very important to NOT forget about moving the time counter after a move, which seems to happen very often and require some very boring backtracking. 

Apart from those rules/component issues, another problem is that this is a very runaway-leader game. Once a player gets some additional actions tiles and a dominant position in points (the senate is the prime offender) it's very difficult to the other players to keep up, which can lead to the last parts of the game being almost useless to play. However, this is a problem that is fixed with repeated games and by gaining experience.

An overrated problem is, instead, the supposed lack of players interaction. While players interaction it's surely not that primary point of this game, it's very present and it's incredibly easy and mean to deprive an opponent of a vital tile at the worse possible moment. Also, there are lot of occasions when multiple actions are available but some of them are the best only if you can do them before the others, and so you have to choose.

All in all, a very solid and good game that, maybe, could have been designed a little better to make even less intimidating than it looks.

Played this late in the evening at UK Games Expo, with a fried brain and sat with the board upside-down to me. As I actually did very well, I thought this was a very satisfying and well-designed game. 

The mancala is interesting - it drives your play and there are ways it can be exploited, ways it can trip you up. It ties in to three elements of the game - how you choose what action to take, whether you get a bonus tile (if available)  for the action you take, and how much you push the game clock on. Similar sorts of choices, decisions and benefits to rondel systems. At the moment |I'm finding the 'push the game clock' element to be of most tactical significance - forcing the early end of a turn can deprive your opponent of points, whilst you make sure to score easy quick points early on. It has the potential to be baffling or induce AP, but I found it pretty intuitive to use.

Components-wise the game is a pleasing package. There is a bit of set up and tear down involved owing to the million and one pieces, manageable in about ten minutes each way. 

The game (in my playing experience) it feels closest to is Village - multiple ways to score, manipulation of time and game length. Trajan is less novel and somewhat less interactive, but it feels as though there may be more to explore in the range of tactical options.

After 1 play I have a couple of major complaints. I'll probably give this another try as I am generally a big admirer of Feld's work but wow... for now these things really killed the game for me.

1. What the heck does any of this have to do with the Roman Empire? I mean seriously.

2. I found the mancala integration to be profoundly irritating. It needlessly layers complication and obfuscation on top of what I think should be the simplest of observations and actions. What actions are available to me? How do I take the action I wish to take? Sometimes it will be OK. Sometimes you'll want to drop a couple of colored tokens and you'll know where you want to put them or at least have some strong indicator of where they should land. But there will also be plenty of other times where you'll drop 5 or 6 colored tokens in 5 or 6 distinct places and there will literally be SEVERAL HUNDREDS of options ... and there will be virtually no way for you to weed out the good from bad options. It's worse than your typical non-decision. It's a non-decision of an incredible magnitude of options.

Like many, I thought at first that this was a game that simply combined a hodgepodge of mechanisms with little rhyme or reason. But after playing it a half dozen times, I came to understand just how interconnected all of the pieces are and truly appreciated the elegance of this design. It's really quite a masterpiece. I've now put in a dozen plays already...I imagine I'll never be great at playing this game, but I sure will have a lot of fun in the process!

RATING: 7
Oh let me count the ways... there are to score victory points. How Stefan Feld balances and play tests all these multiple paths to victory games I have no idea. Somehow it seems to work though. Plus, I like the theme even if it is a bit thin.

So here you've got again a very limited number of actions you can perform on your turn. Like Castles of Burgundy you can have a particularly satisfying turn where you've managed a chain a Trajan tile action together with a double special action tile for a big turn. Other turns you'll find it's little baby steps as you plan for another big move a few turns away. All the while you're trying to time everything you want to fit in before the end of the quarter. Add a few races with your opponents here and there - mainly for shipping and provinces, but especially in the Senate. In the end you have a suitable brain burner that works equally well with 2-4 players.

Driving all this is the mancala, which is controls the pace of the game, the actions you can select and the Trajan tiles you can activate. It dispenses with the luck of the dice and puts you firmly in control and responsible for the good and the bad. I enjoyed a similar system in Finca, but here you've got your own rondel and there's nobody to interfere with yours... well, except that you have to keep an eye on where they can go with theirs before you.

It's well done and it's a good game I'm keen on exploring further. It might be my favourite new game from 2011.

The novelty of this game is its action system. It uses a mandala like mechanic, in which the players perform the action of the last stone placed. Besides, if this stone makes a combination that is present in the spot, the player wins its effect. So, the players constantly have to decide if they want to do an action, or better to perform another one to win the bonus.

Kinda . . . Eh.  I think the hook is awesome.  I'd love to see a game a little more focused on that. I'm not sure how big a fan I am of the bucket of points games.

But I appreciate the game and it doesn't suck to play.

Another winner from Stefan Feld. As is common with many of his designs, it's all about points, points, and points. And also points. You can focus on various areas, probably specializing is best, if possible. And chain together action when you can.

But the real winner here is easily the personal Mancala everyone has on their board. I'm sure this is one of my favorite single mechanisms ever. I find it very original and an intriguing way to select actions, not only managing where you want to end the rotation, but which color you want to place along the way. And it also controls how quickly or slowly the game ends. Just a great little puzzle that everyone is trying to solve.

I anticipate this one getting a lot of play from me over the coming years.

Didn't enjoy this much. Too fiddly - would grind to a halt if any players are AP prone - and the theme could not be more pasted on. Even the rules describe victory as the acquisition of VPs - there's not even a pretense that this is about gaining Prestige or Influence in Rome.
The mechanics are very clever - but the mancala doesn't even pretend to simulate anything at all - it's just there as another interesting puzzle to be solved. I MAY give it another try - as I say it's certainly a very clever design, but I had no feeling at all that I was doing anything related to Rome.

Another excellent game by Stefan Feld.  Typical of his games, there are lots of points to be collected from various actions.  I really dig the mancala-type rondel, but I am a big fan of rondels.  The way the commodities cards interact with the shipping are pretty cool as is the senate mechanic.  I also really like how the speed of the game is metered by how many cylinders you move.

I really like Trajan, and I feel very lucky that my SO does as well. In fact, she caught on so quickly that our plays are 3-1 for her so far.

Castle of Burgundy was a two-player grand slam for us, and Trajan seems to be only a small step up in complexity from Castles.

The mancala mechanism is really neat because, just as the main game tasks you with running the Roman empire efficiently (through trade, construction, political and military avenues), so too does this 'mini-game' challenge you to utilize your mancala stones with maximum efficiency. This game-within-a-game has a real puzzle-ly feel that truly sets Trajan apart in the field of strategy games.

The game still feels kind of tactical as opposed to strategic at times, and you may find yourself settling on short-term gains and reacting to your opponent(s) more often than setting up your big turns, but, boy, when those big turns do come through, they are delicious with a laurel-wreathed cherry on top!

I very heartily recommend this title to anyone who has enjoyed Castles of Burgundy and would like to try something equally abstract but also equally satisfying.

Oh, and if you haven't tried Castles of Burgundy yet, what are you waiting for??!!

RATING: 7.5
A game where every action scores points, but some actions score more points than others, some have more risk with a higher potential payoff while others are guaranteed but with lower payoffs.  Some of the actions are inherently inferior to others most of the time, but in some situations become very valuable.  The winner is the player who most efficiently uses their turns to score points, strategically planning their future actions with occasional tactical decisions based on the current state of the board.

The entire game revolves around effectively positioning the action markers on your mancala trays to accomplish Trajan tiles and to take the actions you want when you want them.  Players who enjoy planning several moves ahead will love this game as the manacala mechanic is brilliant.

This is mostly an abstract game with a pasted on theme, so if you want to play a game about Rome look elsewhere.  Player interaction is fairly low, but those who ignore what other players are doing will probably not win.  Occasional situations in the miltary, construction, and senate areas can allow one player to have a large impact on other player's scores.

Trajan is the funfair of Euros; it's an assortment of minigames glued together by a mancala mechanism. It's easy to assume that the game's all about manipulating the mancala to get your desired actions, but you will also have to account for opponents muscling into your scoring paths and manipulating the speed of a round. The addition of self-imposed objectives (in the form of Trajan tiles) to up the difficulty of puzzle-solving is a very clever touch and one of my favourite aspects of the game.

After several games spread over a generous time span, I've come to appreciate the disjointed minigames. By minimising the ripple effect that an action in one particular area has on the rest of the game, decision-making is kept breezy. I also like how the relative scoring value of the minigames shift according to the number of players. (This is primarily meant to be played with either 3 or 4 players though.)

If anything, perhaps I would have liked a greater integration of theme and some originality in the minigames. And like most Feld designs, Trajan exists more as an exhibition piece for a single cool mechanism. But there is no denying it is good at what it does; it appeals to the puzzle-loving side of me with just the right amount of pokes and prods from the changing game state to keep me on my toes.

My second favorite Feld! Perhaps just because of the amount I have played it. The mancala aspect of this game ensures that you will be doing some long-term planning. However, you are constantly assessing the board to adjust your plans as necessary. Like most Felds, there are multiple paths to victory as you can gain points from a variety of strategies. I believe that I often find myself going for the same angle in a lot of Euros, but somehow Trajan manages to always have me changing things up. Another thing I like about this game is that you don't have much downtime, even though it is turn-based, because each individual turn goes quickly, assuming you are not playing with anyone that suffers from analysis paralysis.

Weird mixture of city building in Rome, and Mancala. You have a rondel with 6 fields and 12 tokens. When it's your turn, you choose one of the fields, take all the tokens from there, distribute them onto the next (clockwise) fields, and can then do the action on the last field that got a token. Additionally, the tokens have different colours, and if you manage to produce certain combinations in one field, you get a bonus action. You can buy those bonus tokens (showing necessary colour combinations) yourself and try to place them in such a way that you will be able to complete the colour combination later. So, uhm, yeah. Let's call the action selection mechanism "interesting".

Első játékra nekem Egizia és Burgund összegyúrva. Az Egiziához hasonlóan rengeteg helyen lehet pontot gyűjteni, az igazi újdonság a mancala rendszerű akcióválasztás. Aki ezt jól átlátja nyerő lehet, de teljesen újoncok között nem volt nagy pontkülönbség a végén. Nagyon rosszul játszani nem lehet. Nem nyűgözött le a Trajan, semmi újat nem találtam benne az akcióválasztáson kívül. Egy jól összegyúrt játék, de nekem nem több ennél. Ha ez lenne az első Feld, amit megismerek biztosan jobbra értékelném, mert amúgy egy teljesen jól működő játék. Látva azonban a tervező többi munkáját, azokhoz képest nekem nem jobb.

4 év után sikerült vele a második partit is lejátszani. Úgy érzem a játék fő erőssége a sok utasság. A rengeteg lehetőség talán kicsit sok is már, de végülis jól játszható. A pontszám marad. Jó kis játék.

Only five plays under my belt, but I dig this game. It really feels like you're doing something, and the personal mancala mechanic is sublime. Our first game was a little long, but I know that will streamline as we learn what everything does and how it all connects. The "chaining" aspect of one thing connecting to another is impressive.

No specific theme. you are just someone who tries to get influence in ancient Rome. A rondel system which makes you a mess of trying to match the colors. You have to use all of the actions or the Rondel will not help you. It lacks replayability.

2nd play: a little bit better but not much

3rd play: you need to keep a very good balance of the Rondel or else you get punished

Played my first game last night with two other people who played once before. Theme is good ( I believe that all boardgames are pretty much abstracts). Lots of stuff going on with some interaction. An example would be to grab a construction tile to keep someone from getting the 3rd or 4th tile because 3-of-a-kind equals 10 VP and 4-of-a-kind equals 20 VP. 
 I look at the "Mancala" part of the game as all the variables that are present in the building of an empire.
I'm sure this game is similar to many other games and my experience is limited in boardgames so I can't compare it to anything else out there. 
 If you want a Euro-style brain burner then this would be good pickup.

Edit: Played again Tuesday and won. Definitely a set collecting exercise but has many paths to victory. You can't try to do everything if you want to win but you have to be adaptable to the changing conditions.

RATING: 5
This is a complex eurogame where each player has a mancala-like rondel puzzle on the player board that determines what actions are available to them.  The player must coax this "puzzle" in order to do what they want in the game, otherwise they will have no control over the game.  I imagine this could be frustrating for some.  The gameplay mehcanics have nothing to do with the theme, especially the mancala/rondel. I doubt this game will satisfy the people.

One of the things I like about Feld is that he puts a lot of different ideas in a game and gives you lots of different ways to win.  Trajan is a good game, but I feel like it might be a little *too* convoluted with ideas and mechanics.  I think I prefer his "simpler" designs, like Luna or Castles of Burgundy, although I enjoyed my play of Trajan.

The mancala mechanic is what makes this game so great.  But it still suffers from traits I typically don't like in games. You're not really building towards anything, just grabbing for points.  Tons of mini-games that don't really make a cohesive game.  Lots of analysis paralysis.  

This game plays really well as a turn-based online game.

In the top 3 of games from 2011 in my opinion. I think that the use of mancala to put an interesting twist on the rondel action selection is really cool, including how it selects your bonus tiles. With all of the options also present on the game board, there is lots of depth to this one that offers some really original ideas for gameplay.

I finally got to try this game, from way back (seemingly, although I guess it's only been 6 months) at Essen, at Gathering '12! I've really been enjoying Feld's recent games, like Macao, Luna, and Burgundy, as well as older games like Roma which I discovered just this past year. This is yet another very cool game! I don't think I like it quite as much as Macao, but it's pretty close!

It's an action-selection game which uses a Mancala-like system where the bowls are in a circle, and each of the 6 stops in the circle corresponds to a different action (acquire various tiles, place meeples into scoring areas, etc). In addition, the game starts with 3 Trajan tiles on 3 of these stops, each with their own action. It takes some planning to figure out how to set up your pieces such that you can take the actions you want in the order you desire. The speed at which people move through their Mancala circle sets the pace of the game -- I think it's a total of 24 steps around a timer circle, 4 times before the game ends (and there is, of course, a little bit of pain that happens after 3 of those trips if you haven't collected the right stuff).

Great game ... will probably look for a copy myself!

After one play this may have become my favorite Feld game.

Most of the game is standard Feld fare.  Players take turns doing one of six different actions to acquire victory points.  Each action relates to a different mini-game style mechanic that scores you points in different ways.

The unique mechanic in this game is how the actions are actually selected.  Each player has a wheel with 6 trays and 12 different action tokens.  These tokens are moved around the wheel and where they end up is the action that player can take.  Each action token is also one of 6 different colors and tiles are assigned to different trays that need 2 action tokens to accomplish.  When those action tokens are in those trays the tile is accomplished giving the player points and a bonus action.

The game plays at a pretty decent clip, isn't terribly complicated, and I love both the variety of actions and paths players can take as well as the unique action wheel mechanic.

While this is a fine game, I fear it suffers from the cult of the new, in that few are willing to talk about its weaknesses. The mechanics are very good, but the rules could be more clearly translated, and the theme is very much pasted on - this is, honestly, simply a well designed Euro, with elegant mechanics, but very little going for it beyond those mechanics, which, in the end, are simply another way of "shifting cubes." In other words, it may wear out its welcome quickly for you if you are looking for a game whose theme and environment particularly excitement. 

Not a bad game, by any means, and certainly deserves admiration and respect, but again, I don't know if it's really "Exciting" enough to have a great deal of sustainability/replayability in the long term.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
First impression shows me a game with zillions of options and mechanics. But they all seem to work and the best part of the game is that it can actually be fun to play despite all that is going on. The rondel is the best of Feld's rondels so far in my opinion. It looks like he has been working on this rondel system for a few games so far and with Trajan, although it's not as brilliant as the real Mac Gerdts rondel, it's fun to use and simple. It's not even essencial to have it in the game but it adds a cool and fun (maybe the only real fun thing the game has) aspect that I enjoy very much.
The boring aspect of the game is the ammount of things that you can do. Too many things being most of them just not fun things. 

UPDATE:
In the end, everything is always about taking points. There's no substance in the theme and in the strategy. It seems too much tactical.

This game is pretty hard. Has the "oh shit I have to think several moves ahead" factor that are featured in abstract combinatorial games thanks to the mancala but it also prevents you from thinking too far ahead because you have to closely monitor the actions of other players and react to them. The game is really nice though, and the mancala serves as a unique and effective control mechanic.

Good game; Feld point salad, but that's fine with me. Lost the first 2p (after solo run-through) as I thought I'd get 9vp for every hat that I had - nope, just the one - but made up for it in the second game! 

Still some confusion about personal play area vs. put in front of you vs. hand for goods, and what scores at the end - must clarify - but all in all, great, and Liz is a fan too.

The game feels v much like Macao and Die burgen in that small incremental actions can be linked together in phases - also in that there a lot of points in the game and lot of ways  of getting theem. The Manacala/Rondel is frustratingly brilliant - after one play I am concerned that the back end Vp generators are not as interesting as how the actions string together (Vanuatu from the same year at Essen has raised the same concerns for me)  The theme is less of a paste on than most other recent Feld designs, however its still wafer thin. I tend to like Feld's post 2008 designs on first play and grow to dislike them after repeated plays - I hope that this will not follow that path.

Alas, a second game and its gone down in my estimation, second game felt as solitaire as the first with a little competition for the military spaces. otherwise, players focused on own rondel. Too many point scoring routes for competition to be very meaningful. Moreover, the linked actions feel like a math exercise. Admirable, but tedious

It is nicely produced and the rules are clear.

By far the Feldiest of the Felds that I've played.

Extremely difficult to grasp the overarching strategy. Too many minigames to keep track of, let alone controlling the mancala player board. Because of that, it feels like either too much game or a really light tactical game. Either way it's fun.

You get points! You get points!

RATING: 8
A common eurogame design pattern these days is to unify several simple, well-worn subsystems through some mechanical novelty which justifies the game's existence -- it's not [i]just[/i] a knockoff of X, Y and Z because actions are resolved by balancing cards on your nose and no-one has ever done that in a game before! The example I always point to is Macao, which survives on the strength of its weird cube-rondel "windrose".

Well, Trajan is like Macao+, lessening the focus on damage mitigation while drastically increasing the level of forced planning. Replacing the windrose is a mancala rondel with twelve cylinders in six colours spread across six action spaces. Choosing an action redistributes the cylinders; having the correct cylinders on a given space can activate a "Trajan tile" assigned there, providing victory points and/or another bonus.

Most rondel and worker placement games feature a strong tension between efficiency of action and limited opportunities -- it's better to do action A before action B, but what if the round ends or another player gets to B first? Trajan cranks this up to eleven. Not only do you have to manage your actions on the rondel, you have to manage your cylinders for future actions while obtaining and activating Trajan tiles. The builder action can provide instant bonus actions; the forum and military actions can provide action-tiles which allow a given action to be executed twice instead of once (or three times if you also have the "X2" bonus-bonus from the relevant Trajan tile!). Planning for efficient actions is delicious AP hell, and of course your opponents are constantly stealing your opportunities and ruining eveything.

I do have some misgiving about the impact of luck, particularly the uncertain payoff from helmet/fire/food Trajan tiles and the commodity draw, but the mancala is so fantastic that it's still my favourite Feld game and possibly my game of the year for 2011. Brilliant.

RATING: 8
This is quite engrossing.  My only qualm is whether it might have a little bit TOO much stuff going on.  It's possible to win while paying essentially no attention at all to a couple of the six main things you get to do from landing in your mancala bowl.  I wonder if they playtested a version with only five things instead of six?  Nevertheless, it's a good mental workout and fun to do.  P.S. Raising my original rating from a year ago to an 8.

Probably a little bit "over-designed" meaning that there are already too many little levers to pull.
The central Mancala mechanism is easier to steer than you might think at the beginning. It is possible (although not necessarily prudent) to do the same action repeatedly up to 20 times in a row. Try it!

There's also a decent amount of randomness and some luck (with what demand tiles are turned over and such) that feels out of place for such a heavy euro. Definitely isn't a bad game and I enjoyed playing it, but I'm not always in the mood for something like this.

A játék gyakorlatilag absztrakt. Senki se várja, hogy az ókori Róma világába csöppen. Viszont nagyon jó. A szokott mechanizmus-mix Feldtől. Kiváló, önmagukban is izgalmas mechanizmusok jól összerakva és a rotán való haladás is nagyon izgalmas. Nagyon egyben van és bár rengeteg féle mechanizmus és ennek következtében rengeteg szabályrészlet van a játékban, mégis jól érthető, logikus átlátható. Remek, agyégető játék.
Sokat kell vele játszani, hogy az ember ne csak úgy érzésre döntsön, döntögessen, hanem tudatosan. Az ezernyi lehetőség és számolhatóság AP-sé teheti, de az is tény, hogya többiek köre alatt bőven van idő tervezgetni és számolgatni. Valószínűleg 5-10 játék után mutatja magát igazán a Trajan. A játékidő korrekt, kivételesen nincs semmi hazugság a 30 perc/játékos oké.

There are a lot of clever bits going on in the game, but for me they don't really mesh together well. The game is also a little too long (45 minutes too long perhaps), but it was a first play.

Elegant design.  Many options, many paths to victory.  Can seem a little daunting at first, even for gamers, as it's not quite like anything else I've played before even though it has some similar mechanics.  Really fantastic game.

This seemed to be way to much work manipulating the mancala for the amount of fun involved.  Which, in turn, makes for an overly long game for the amount of fun involved.  

There are many games I'd rather play.  I'll admit the mancala was interesting, but ultimately it's not enough interesting to build a game on that has so much other stuff going on too.

Like the Mancala mechanic for choosing your action. It`s a game in a game.

On some actions you have a choice what you want to do.

Another Feld game with a penalty system.

Why a season of a year has here 4 months. It`s the only thing which is strange :)

Definitely my favorite game of 2012.  I would reserve the "point salad" moniker for Bora Bora over Trajan, since the individual scoring components seem to fit better to me than Bora.  And the mancala is a great idea, definitely gives you something to work out while awaiting your next turn.  Brilliant game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The mancala mechanic is interesting, and forces you to plan out two, three, or even four turns in advance. This advanced planning adds interest, and gives you something to do while the other players are taking their turns. If not for the mancala mechanic, I would probably complain about downtime and/or the lack of serious interaction. You can steal certain chits that other players may want. You can hurry the game along in order to screw others out of turns (this is actually a solid mechanic, and I should probably give it more credit). However, Trajan still feels solitaire-ish to me.

Trajan is fiddly, and most certainly all about maximizing a lot of little points. As in many of these types of games, there are a number of different point "stations" that you hit up for chits that translate into VPs. (Does anyone else feel like games with "station" end up feeling like a mish-mash of little mini-games? See also Tribune.) It's a fun game. I enjoyed it. But it's not elegant. And it's not really innovative beyond the mancala mechanic. What Trajan really makes me want to do is try out some more mancala games!

RATING: 7.3
Loved this game but while the mancala was interesting it kind of ruined it for me a little bit. However further plays may change this. My brain just doesn't like the mancala and I get terrible AP, but worst of all, and in all honesty I think this is a big weakness in what could have been one of the best games ever, and that is the fact that the mancala can easily hose you. Sure, it is probably due to bad play, but recovery can be hard. If a game can lock me down to one action to choose from per turn for four turns in a row with no way out of it other than to work towards getting my decisions back by the fifth turn, that is kind of a big weakness. Maybe I'm not admiring just how punishing this game can be, but choice should almost always be the one thing a player retains, no matter how badly they are playing.

RATING: 10
A great, great Feld classic. Probably his meatiest game (that I have played anyway). The mancala action picker is genius as it doesn't allow players to span the same actions and forces you to diversify your strategy to find success. Takes a few plays to really lock down the strategy, but what a wonderful game once you do. Only reason it rates lower than Burgundy is Trajan is much more of a brain burner, and therefore a game you have to be more in the mood for, whereas Burgundy I would play anytime anyone suggested it.

RATING: 8
Tremendously good, with the legendary rondel with nobs on. Learning all the mini games is a bit of a chore at first, but it's easy enough, just takes a while to explain. And after that it really doesn't take long to realise how clever and fluid this design is. And for three newbies and one novice, it was nice to see that we all finished very close together for added tenseness. Good work Herr Feld!

RATING: 7
After 1 play: I love the mancala mechanism and how the colours work with the Trajan arch tiles. I am therefore disappointed that the actions on the board aren't more interesting. I also have a problem with the balance of the senate cards. The "trading" cards seem terrible in comparison with the others.

I'd like to play it again, but from first impressions it seems like a waste of a brilliant mechanism. With a little more development it could have been a top-10 game. As of now I rate it a 7, though that could rise or fall.

RATING: 6
Trajan is certainly a challenging gamer's game, but that's about the best I can say. It's needlessly complex, a bit fiddly, disjointed, dry, lacks any semblance of theme and is a bit too long. More damning, it just didn't really hold my interest or make me care about what I was doing. I do like the Mancala-like action selection mechanic, and appreciate the depth here. But that's just not enough to save this one.

Read the rules. Pretty complicated rules from the number of different options, but each option is pretty straightforward. Might be difficult to play the first time, but games after that should go smoothly. Tons of ways to score points, so it should have plenty of routes to victory. Components appear to be top notch for a first time company, albeit one with game design veterans. Appears to be a winner.

Multiplayer solitaire for sure. Everybody was staring at their Mancala board and counting... For two hours... yet it was fun. A lot of scoring possibilities but a bit more clear than other point salad games. You have to react to the board state and consider the other players' plans, of course, so there is some indirect interaction.

Of the dry, soulless Euro games that lack meaningful interaction, Trajan may be the best of the bunch.  I'm sure that isn't a quote that they'll put on the box in future printings, but I actually mean that as praise.

Not really important, but this game might have the best cover I've seen.  Very striking, although perhaps doesn't fit the game style or the rest of the aesthetics.

I was not expecting to enjoy this game but I was totally proven wrong. I was expecting the mancala board to be way too complex and the actions to be just as confusing. It turned out to be mostly the opposite, the actions you can take a so simple you pick up the strategy in 1-2 turns. That lets to focus totally on the mancala board and making that work in your favor.

I liked that the main strategies are very quick to pick up, that I never felt overwhelmed or confused during the game. For how complex it is, I feel like you can teach it to a relatively new board gamer and they would enjoy it.

I love Feld games and this one is one of his best in my opinion. Unfortunately my group disagrees with me. I think it has a lot to do with the pasted on theme and maybe the Mancala style of playing.

Keep it up Feld!

This game is mechanically one of the most brilliant examples of modern gaming I can think of. It tickles my fun bone in so many different ways that I can hardly believe it exists. There is little to no theme involved, but sometimes a solid design with cool actions is all one needs for a night of good gaming entertainment. When this is what I want, I reach for Trajan.

Another promising design from Stefan Feld, this time using a mandala mechanic to select one of 6 mini-games to play. Player interaction is indirect. Some of the mini-games (e.g. building) seem overpowered compared to others and there seems to be too many goods in the shipping action to make it effective, but that may be my lack of experience with the game. Initial rating of 8.

Probably the most Ystari-esque design that Feld has ever done.  That said, his ability to couple agonizing short/long-term decision making with 'punishment' mechanisms (think Macao's punish markers, Notre Dame's rats, and now this, Trajan's Demand Markers) shines brightest here.  Great, great stuff.

My first impression of this game is that it was too chaotic - too many unrelated mechanics blended together create a mess. After another play I have changed my mind. I tend to enjoy games with a wide array of choices available and this one certainly has that going for it. The strange Macala style rondel is a bit of a tease for a math minded player in that it seems predictible but is just complex enough that it almost behaves like dice (manageable dice). 

I decided to buy the game and am glad I did. I may even increase my rating after additional plays.

First Impression:

A collection of interactive and connected mini games with a working theme.

Luckfree, tight, deep and interactive. The main mechanism, a dopped rondel, really kills downtime. Since its the only solo minigame, even if your opponents take their time to decide, you can still burn yourself thinking in 2-3-4 turns depth.

At the same time you can really see the mechanics in this game, the theme appears secondary. The game can also take long, especially if all players are ap prone.

The game is a beautiful and fresh mix of ideas that work together well mechanically, but kill the theme at the same time.

My favourite Feld's design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The mancala mechanism is just plain cool.  It lives up to the billing and makes for a unique centerpiece to the game.  The actions available to a player consist of a Mac Gerdts type Rondel where the number of spaces you can go are based upon the number of pieces in a dish.  It is the centerpiece and focal point, and truly introduces a neat little game to figure out and maximize.  There is not interaction in this portion of the game, and while it will be a turn off to some, I enjoy it as it allows some think ahead.  (This game is brutal with over-analyzers).  

Everything else is about timing.  There is a race aspect for tile collection for three different sub games, a sub game with set collection, and a "Most votes" sub game.  The balancing between the sub contests and the timing between make the mancala rondel a unique experience.  The winner of the most votes gets a reward altering their valuation.  This prevents the game from being scripted and stale, and also doesn't allow for a "best" strategy.

There is also a way to match colors and tiles at a dish location to gain a bonus action. 

I'm only two plays in, but this game is so clever.  I enjoy the decisions I'm faced with, and I look forward to increasing my skill.  Our second 2 player game took 1.5 hours including set up and take down.  Look out.

I can't imagine playing this with an AP prone player.  I haven't, and I will refuse to.

After further reflection, the sub games are just well disguised (and flexible) tech trees.  

Just awesome.  10 potential.

Usually I don't hold off on commenting on a game. This one I did. I had to really take my time to digest this one. I initially rated this as a 9 but now with 5 plays under my belt I know it's better than a 9. This is a 10. I love everything about this game. I don't find I have any problems with it at all. Yeah this game is awesome.  

I honestly feel this one plays every bit as well at 2 as 3 or even 4 players. Such a perfect game.

This is truly a gem. It has a key mechanism to take actions that is innovative, challenging, and has its own kind of resource management. Brilliant!!!

This is not a light game, so don't bother play it if you don't like Caylus.

Awesome gamer's game. Mancala core system 'makes' the game, it is ellegant and injects a good dose of depth to the game. Trajan deserves nearly everything I want in a good euro for 60-90 min:

-Long term thinking (strategy): Nearly from the beginning of the game you have to think about the endgame scoring: bonus tiles you are earning during the game, leads you to focus in something to get many endgame points (shipping, construction, military, senate, demands)

-Medium term thinking: Mancala 'look ahead', how to accomplish demand neeeds for that quarter.

-Tactical decisions: you have often to react to your opponents: go first to the forum when a new quarter starts, pick any important tile when situation is able to, senate race...

-A bit of spatial reasoning: Construction and military actions deserves a bit of 'area control' thinking

-Enough randomness to make the game different every time but not to hurt the players.

-60-90 min playtime: This game has a lot of going on for such playtime.

-Stressful: Acomplishing citizen demands adds some stress to the game. There is also the feel you haven´t time to do everything you want.

Nearly everything you do in Trajan scores, the key is to be as efficient as you can in your actions. Trajan deserves a nice balance between planning/mancala efficiency, and adapting your play to which is happening on the board.

Luck plays a small role here (commodity cards, forum and bonus tiles...), but clever play is a lot more important and the best player will win nearly every day.

Trajan scales wonderfully from 2 to 4 players. A bit more strategical and less competitive with 2, and more tactical and competitive with 4 but I enjoy it with any number.

A lot of moving parts with this one.  Some are obviously interlinked, others not as much.  The mancala action is very nice.  If it was 30 minutes shorter (took us 90 with 4 and I can't see that improving) then it would be higher rated.  Pay attention to scoring your bonus tiles, and acquiring more of them.
Would happily play again, others in my group never want to as they felt it was far too random.

RATING: 8.5
If you can get someone to play a second time, I think they'll have a hard time not liking Trajan. What other people call "points-salad" amounts to a heavily obfuscated goal structure. It's hard to tell people what to do to win the game. You need the most points, but you get points for everything. Seeing through the hail-storm of points is part of the puzzle, and that requires at least a second play. The manacala-board action selection mechanism will take longer than that to get the hang of, but I feel like its addictive as soon as you have limited success with it. If it's hanging you up every turn in your first game, the game will feel arduous. But if you can string together a 2 or 3 turn combo that you're proud off, you'll get the bug. I find the whole experience very satisfying, and, 9 plays in, I'm really enjoying the cat-and-mouse game created by giving players control of the length of a year. Trying to time thing so that you have first play at the beginning of a year is really important. Because of this, I disagree with those who say this game is equally good at every player count. I like 2 and 3 the best, because you get a little more control over this mechanic. All in all, a rich and rewarding game that I'll be playing for years.

Might be even better than Castles of Burgundy. Great fun, comes out close almost every time, even fun when I lose. Great mix of strategy and tactics, the "luck" is somewhat in the tiles that come out, but more in the chaos you develop in your own mancala. So it's self-induced "luck," which is great. 

We've played it 2p and 3p, and it's great at both of those counts. Haven't tried 4. For now, we prefer a house rule--we remove the wild-card tiles for the construction area. Those tiles sway the game too much, we think, though we may reconsider at some point.

Another interesting game from Stefan Feld, who is rapidly becoming one of my favourite designers! As always with mr Feld's games, this game is all about damage control and a dwindling number of options, resulting in agonizing decisions and quite a bit of "turn angst". This time, the fresh mechanism is a Mancala rondel - an interesting idea that plays out like a personal puzzle within the main game, unfortunately leading to a decrease in interactivity with other players. Even though the artwork of the game does not appeal to me, the components of the game are of an excellent quality - certainly much better than the quality of most Alea games. All in all, I would love to play this game again, but I do not need to own it. But that's only because I slightly prefer Stefan's more accessible games (like Notre Dame and In The Year Of The Dragon). The explanation of this game is pretty daunting.

Já é o segundo jogo do Feld q eu jogo (o primeiro foi Burgundy) e de fato... mais uma vez não me disse nada. Parece uma mistureba de diversos estilos, muitas opções e a bagunça na minha mente acaba imperando mais do q outra coisa. E pra mim o pior é o tal do sistema rondell... Várias jogadas inúteis para chegar ao que se quer. Pode ser q com um pouco mais de jogadas me dê o "click", mas a verdade é q, ao contrário do Burgundy q me chamou um pouco ao menos, esse nem me deu vontade de tentar de novo. Uma pena.

A work of Bavarian madness - every popular euro mechanic of the last decade, smooshed together and orbiting a central mechanic based on an ancient African pebble game. That it plays so smoothly and works so well as a deep strategic experience is a supreme design achievement. Who cares if it doesn't feel like Rome?

RATING: 6
OK, but such a load of Feldy - Feldiness it's almost unbearable. This has to be the most point-salad-y of all Feld games. The minigames seem like they have even less to do with each other than in his other titles, and unlike Castles of Burgundy, you don't feel like you've accomplished or built anything when it's all said and done. What you're left with is less than the sum of its parts. It's not a bad game, it's just impossible for me to enjoy playing it.

This was an interesting game and is worth a play to see how it all fits together.

I would much rather be playing other games though.  Most of the game is a solo optimisation puzzle about how to maximise move sequences on your own personal Mancala.  This was interesting to do once but doesn't hold long term appeal.  The board elements seemed detached from this mechanic.  There was some room for blocking opponents on the main board but I spent 90% of the game looking at my Mancala and 10% focusing on the main board state.

First impression was that I liked all the little mini-games, which were each simple on their own.  I liked the constant race feeling, trying to beat the clock each season.

I have to admit, I was skeptical after reading the rules. Although intrigued by the Mancala mechanic, I feared that there was going to be looooooog downtime between the turns.
But I can now join the growing choir of gamers exited about this game, because the opposite is true: turns are very short and, even more important, you can plan ahead while others take their turn. So yes, there are a plethora of options, but the game has a nice flow.
With this general conditions given, I can't wait to dive into all these options a little deeper.

One of the players I play with described this as six separate minigames, all governed by a larger game of [gameid=2448].  It's a glib, but apt, criticism. The minigames don't fit well together, and they are almost completely separated.  The little interaction that does occur is subsumed in the Mancala minigame on individual player boards.  There's no theme here of any significance, and the gameplay is dry as dust.  It's one of the best examples of JASE - Just Another Soulless Euro.

RATING: 9
Yet another brilliant Feld game. It's amazing the roll he's on with Macao, Burgund, and Trajan. Even the lesser lights like Speicherstadt are good games.

Fast turns with low downtime, as your mancala mechanism generally means you can only choose from 2 or 3 actions. But, with so many ways to use those actions on the main board, the decision space is deliciously large. Great fun to set yourself up from turn to turn (I'll move this here here and here this turn, then next turn I'll move that and that, setting up blue and yellow together, so the turn after that I'll do this which will give me this tile for 9 points...)

RATING: N/A
The first game was a little bit lengthy, three newbies and rules took some time. Lots of different things to do, you get victory points from everywhere and so on. Feels like an ok game, the game was quite even in the end. It didn't feel like living in the Ancient Rome, it is more like moving wooden things around. Lots of times you can't do what you would like to do based on the game mechanics instead of the theme. So it is little bit difficult for newbies and non-gamers, because intuition is not the key.

Good looking game with good quality components.

The special thing about this game is the "wheel". It has 6 bowls in wich you place meeples. Each bowl represents an action on the board. If you want to act one out you have to move the meeples so that the last meeples stops in the bowl you want to act out. 

Nice mechanic, wich can get you into trouble sometimes.

RATING: 2
UPDATE: Traded. Not as good as Castles of Burgundy. Just a lever-pulling VP generating optimisation game and transparently so. No feeling of building anything or doing anything interesting at all.

UPDATE: With repeated plays it's very very dry. The mancala feels like a bit of a gimmick designed to stop you taking the actions you want.

Deep game that we're exploring in the 100 Play Challenge. It's better than Castles of Burgandy and Macao, but less fun than Luna - in my opinion. It feels pretty dry and abstract. The mancala mechanic is extremely interesting and adds lots of strategic depth - worth trying or buying for that alone.

The component quality is as high as Luna, and significantly better than Castles and Macao from the Alea line.

The game rewards repeated play - I didn't understand how to work the mancala and take the actions I wanted until my third play or so.

I'm not generally a fan of Feld's self-absorbed point salad games, but the mancala-esque action mechanism in Trajan really tickles my fancy. Plus, this isn't really a point salad, as there is a focus on mid and long range goals that are constantly under threat by your opponents. There's just enough interaction here to keep things tense, and the random tile draw keeps the puzzle fresh. As much as I respect In the Year of the Dragon, I just have more fun playing this; I think this might be my favorite Feld.

What an amazing idea to use the main Mancala mechanism as the main engine for a complex Euro. Feld absolutely knocked it out of the park with this one. The game is essentially 5 or 6 mini-games, with each players Mancala board determining exactly which one they get to play on any given turn. The only randomness to that is the starting arrangement of your Mancala. After that, you are in complete control. The better you plan, the better you will be able to fire off whatever move on whatever mini-game you want. Of course, being a Feld game, if you plan well you can even get multiple moves on a single turn, if you can combo out. There is so much to think about and so many ways to make clever moves that you rarely if ever, have a turn that can run on autopilot. This is Feld's best, by far. Buy it.

A truly pasted on theme if ever there was one. And that's saying something for a Feld game. However, the mancala mechanic is used to great applause by some of my gaming friends.

This looks nice and well-considered, but too redundant for me to pick up, at least right now.

The king of point salad games. This is my favourite Stefan Feld's design (followed very closely by Bora Bora). The mankala-based action selection system is simply brilliant. There's just enough subtle player interaction woven into the mechanics to not make you feel disjointed from other players. What I love about this game is the deep sense of satisfaction it evokes when finalizing all your carefully prepared combos. Playing Trajan is an absolute joy every single time - well done Mr. Feld!

Like so many other Feld's game, Trajan is a very well built game but it is too rich, too full of small parts, details and I just feel overwhelmed by the shear number of things to keep in mind and do. There are dozens of ways to make points and everything isn't held togheter in any way.
The game is very well balanced, the theme is pasted on and useless, played in 2 players it is quite fluid, it flows well, there are many paths to victory.
I am sure it is a good game, quite original, and it deserves good rating, but i don't like it when there is "too much" in a game. Therefore so far it's not an 8

I've learned that while Feld gets a lot of credit and praise, I'm just not that interested in playing his brand of design. Call it point soup or point salad, it's just boring to me. It's mechanics for mechanics sake and after a few games it all looks the same to me.

Trajan combineert lange termijnplanning en korte termijn taktiek op een manier die niet eerder gezien is.

Spelers beschiukken over 12 actiestenen die zij verschuiven over de acties, maar de hoeveelheid bij iedere actie bepaald welke volgende acties beschikbaar zijn. Hierdoor moet je goed vooruit plannen om de gewenste acties beschikbaar te maken. Echter komen er op sommige momenten leuke mogelijkheden naar boven die misschien wel de voorkeur hebben.

Trajan is echt een spel dat na afloop vraagt om nog een keer gespeeld te worden en dat is voor mij altijd een goed teken.

Like the game, but, it really felt like I was playing around with a string of mechanisms that could get me to the end of the game in a variety of ways, only to joylessly win points. I know that is the 'Feld' expectation, but for some reason 'Trajan' was really stripped of no other motivator than to acquire points, and if not for the Rondel, which I am partial to in any game, I would find no real fun in this game. Like playing on a calculator I guess. 

I really enjoy 'Macau' and 'In the Year of the Dragon', but I felt that those instituted mechanisms to move the games along, with some semblance of thematic sense in the action, where as in Trajan, I felt the mechanisms were just there for no particular reason than to have another choice in the matter.

I really like the mancala aspect with the trajan cards but that was really it. I wanted the trajan cards to refill automatically instead of having to take a whole action to get another one. The game shifts from a puzzle to complete the trajan tiles to a puzzle of how to take the actions you want to take but the actions themselves felt very boring and insignificant. It didn't feel satisfying to spend a whole turn to put one worker from my supply onto the board to take one tile from somewhere.

The best 2011 game so far, in my opinion. It has the "Caylus"-Feeling.

Del Stefan Feld que me gusta, la mecánica de juego mola bastante, tema pegado, pero que no desentona y actividad mental durante toda la partida, este se queda en mi ludoteca.

Many different ways of scoring points and a brain burning puzzle in the manacala action selection mechanic make this a hit Feld for me!

A Eurogame that Eurogamers will probably love and others might enjoy too.  The much talked about Rondel action mechanic is as interesting to manipulate to your advantage as you've heard and the way the different parts of the board intereact lead to more player blocking/interaction than you might expect from what looks like a solitaire exxercise at first glance.  I was impressed how non-fiddly it is despite the large number of small bits too.

The theme is paper thin... but at least all the actions make sense in one way or another.  Certainly a game I'd recommend to folks looking for a middleweight Euro.

An OK Euro, but way overhyped.  Annoying like Macao because you repeatedly cannot do what you want.  His Castles of Burgundy is much better.

My favourite Feld game and just a superb blend of really interesting elements. The mancala which drives everything is sublime and wonderfully thinky. There's just so much to sink your teeth into here and plenty of different strategies to explore.

Quintessential Feld.  Uses a mancala to determine action selection for managing an intricate point salad.  Love it.

Nice, challenging game, with indirect influence over the moving parts — which are mostly yours and yours alone — to get what you want.  Love it.

It's decent - the planning ahead aspect of the game mechanic is what attracts me the most.

Yay, Stefan Feld!

RATING: 8.25
Probably "breakable" if you really analyze the rondel mechanism and try to find the "best" strategy to exploit it, but as it stands I have enjoyed both games I tried.  Only played with 3.  2 might be too "solitare-ish" while 4 promises a good deal more conflict.

Szuper játék! :cool: Ritkán szoktam egy játék után véleményt írni, de ez különösen tetszett. Egyrészt nincs feleslegesen túlbonyolítva, ugyanis 6 alapakcióra épül a játék. Tetszik az h lehet manipulálni a játék idejét (az időjelzővel). Sokat lehet taktikázni a játékoskör első fázisánál, ahol akciójelzőinket variálgatjuk.  

Ami különösen tetszik benne az hogy lehet hatalmasakat durrantani benne, szinte szárnyra kelnek pontozókorongjaink :) Már az első partyban volt egy 7 akciós köröm (Trajan lapka teljestése, céltárca akció (építkezés), 2x építkezés combó és az építési területen szerezett építéslapkák segítségével +3 akció, ugyanis még egyik fajtából sem volt a játékostáblámon.) Ez hatalmas játékélményt nyújtott!!! Amikor durrant valamelyik játékos az fokozza a feszültséget a játékostársaiban, ugyanis jócskán le tudnak maradni. :D

Kevés konfrontáció, viszonylag pörgős játékmenet, sok taktikai és stratégiai manőverrel lehet nyerni. Kiválóan felüdítő játék. Megérdemli részemről a magas pontozást, benne van a TOP 10-be.

Nuestro primer Feld, no será el último. Nos encanta las ensadalas de puntos y los mini juegos, a dos funciona bien

RATING: 8
After 2+ Plays: Feld's games are starting to feel a little too familiar.  This game's structure is just so similar to Macao and Castles of Burgundy - one interesting mechanic with a bunch of little ways to score points.  I enjoy those games' central mechanics more, so I won't be suggesting this one. 

After 5+ plays: I've come around a bit on this game.  I do still think these games are too similar, but I continue to enjoy them all, so I'm bumping this from a 7 to an 8.

Te sientes como en un dulce naufragio de mecánicas finamente engranadas y alegres cubitos de todos los colores. Saberlo jugar bien y pronosticar grandes jugadas ya es otra cosa pero no es necesario para dejarte mecer por los giros y vueltas de sus minijuegos.

I enjoy the Mancala part a lot. It's a difficult game to bring to the table. Last time was 2.5 years ago. Also not many people like this game as much as i do. So i think it's time to sell it.

I like the action selection mechanic which reminds me to an extent of Finca, albeit its based on Mencala. There is a lot going on in this game , which is great, and there are multiple paths to get stacks of victory points. You are not building an 'engine' so you can change direction. The theme is very tacked on , but it is enjoyable to play. My only concern is that its a bit too long for my liking - I would like to play it with 3 rather than 4 to see if its the same game , but shorter.

Wow! Talk about an all around fun game. Every turn has a bunch of options for enjoyable, useful actions. I finally found my favorite Feld.

Edit: 3/28/16
After a few plays, the theme - or lack thereof - really becomes apparent. But that isn't the problem. The problem is that it starts to feel like a bunch of small games in one that just don't mesh.

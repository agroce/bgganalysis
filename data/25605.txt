Very interesting majorities game, with very clear interaction (fights) beteween players.  Interesting mechanics to solve the fights, where losing can sometimes be interesting.  The board is a bit too crowded and saturated, but the game is good fun.

After one playing I thought it wasn't a terrible game, just not too memorable. I liked the way the board was created and the pieces were moved on the board, but it just felt like it lacked something.

I liked it a little more after my second playing and am hoping to play it a few more times to see if it continues to improve in my opinion.

Unplayed after one year, I'm starting to loose my interest.

*Update*

First time played after one year and a half since I bought it... What a surprise! I didn't expect much here due to the very low rating and poor reviews so I have delayed its first time to see the table because I always was afraid that my group would kill me for make them play Walhalla.

Walhalla is a fast, easy and fun little majority game that plays in less than 45 minutes. All of us enjoyed the game quite a bit... this is one clear example that a game with a bad rating can be more enjoyable than other in the top 100 (I'm saying no name but you can figure many of them looking at my ratings)... so never judge a game by its cover or, in this case, by its ratings...

*Update*

Second play, this time with 4 players, even better experience. Get a copy of this little game!

This, I think, is the sort of German game that people get a "been there, done that, can't they do anything new?" kind of feeling from. Walhalla is not a bad game, it has clever parts and is balanced and well-executed. It's just that it lacks anything really novel or interesting on the decision-making end, and the theming is virtually non-existent - there is no binding at all between how you move your pieces around and make your decisions, and the thematic elements - it's all in the graphics and layout. I have come to demand some kind of theme/game interconnection, even if it is slight, and Walhalla doesn't even really have that. It could be very easily re-themed to almost anything. Knizia, despite the flak he sometimes takes, would never let so disconnected a game out the door.

So ... I did enjoy playing Walhalla, and might even play again. But I doubt I will, and I imagine the game will be on the trade/sale pile cheap pretty soon.

First Play of this one and it seems a really interesting little game but it makes quite a difference in what cards you draw. I had two shields very early on and never got chance to use them. Still had them at the end as axes were used. I am unsure how I managed to come second - Lot of fields but I was so far behind. I'm not sure the Valhalla mechanic of what guys yoiu get for the next round works that well either. I did like it though. 1 Play.

I had never heard of this game, so when I found myself looking at a table of a small game library I and my fellow players (who were equally ignorant) decided to give this title a go. The rules were a bit obtuse in that they don't really make clear the difference between victory points and peninsula points which then amount to victory points (trust the iconography instead); and that they don't spell out how the action cards played during peninsula scoring work (we eventually ruled that a card applies to all peninsulas at the same time). 

The game itself is one of somewhat blunted incentives. You draw a boat which has room for three Vikings, at least two of which can be your own. The third place can be taken by another player if so indicated. You then place the boat ('Dragon') alongside a peninsula with various action spaces, and then disembark onto those spaces. You can get action cards, points, or influence for the peninsula majority (which also yields points). Of course you can attack other players who then have to decide whether to lose or to win the conflict; this determines how many Vikings end up in Walhalla, and thus how many reinforcements you get for the next round. After all Dragons have been played, the peninsulas are scored in various ways; the boats are removed, most Vikings too, and after reinforcements a new round begins. At the end of the third round there's two more (but different) scoring rounds, and most points wins.

The incentives come in from asking another player to join you on your raid. That player has to decide [i]before[/i] you make the decision where to sail to, and this involves a calculable risk, as there are at most 8 positions you can end up in (4 boat positions x 2 orientations). Usually one tries to maroon the other player in combat: all land spaces are useful, so with combat it is at least more difficult to get to it. 

It took us a while to decide how this game was meant to be played, and by that time my initial response was a bit 'hmhm'. The incentive-thing is nice and straightforward, but there is so much point hoarding in this game going on that it grew a bit on my nerves. The points you win are relatively small compared to what you eventually obtain in a round, and that gives the game a slight air of 'it doesn't matter what you do, you get points anyway'. Good point hoarding is also augmented by good action cards, so it makes sense to go in a direction the cards tell you to... Which is a bit of a drawback. I'm sure that all avenues to serious points are more or less balanced, but because of it there isn't much room for creative or interesting play. 

All in all a bit of a disappointment. I'll probably play another game or two, but this is definitely not a title I would want to purchase to enrich my collection with.

Players represent rival Viking clans that invade the Fjords of some unknown land and battle it out for the best positions. Now "the best positions" is somewhat ambivalent in this game, since it depends highly on cards you may have in your hand and on whether you are playing the 1st, 2nd or 3rd round. In the end, the player with most Victory Points (VPs), is the winner.

Solid majority game. Not much innovation in this one, but it works really well. Figuring out your opponent plan is maybe the best part of the game. Various scoring options make for different paths to victory, still it's not all that strategic. A very good 45 minutes game.

An average game in almost every aspect. Worker placement combined with area control and card driven game. The rules are fine and after a few minutes you know everything you need. The lenght of the game is exactly as it should be.

But there is something that makes the game almost unplayable - it's the artwork. Oh, man! My 6-years old niece would make it more clear and visible. It's simply HORRIBLE!!! The designer must have been color-blind - I can't find any other explanation for this disaster.

Enjoyable game.  Board looks great, the theme works for me, I particularly like the Valhalla mechanism. Game play a little dry as you try to factor the permutations of each possible placement, but moves along well. Easy buy at 18E.  Jan 07 - missed rule about viking being returned to Midgard if forced to attack self (makes accompanying others less risky), and missed rule about selling an action card to get a viking from Asgard - an extra tactical option.

An interesting idea with attractive artwork.  It's a little difficult to keep all the peninsula pieces straight as you insert and remove the ships.  If the game moves quickly, this could almost be classified as a longer filler, which is how I would prefer to play it.  I like how the defender chooses whether to win or lose the battles.  Ultimately the game doesn't feel quite right and does not engage as much as I would like.

Traded away.

A nice mix of mechanisms that at first felt a bit better than it actually is. It is good but not great. Like in Carcassonne the fields are strong and the game looks quite good. The action cards have a negative similarity to Amun-Re the luck of the draw is likely to be a deciding factor in even plays.

Quite a dry game. The overall mechanisms sound great and in practice mesh well together - it just is not a fun game, in our game there was no hilarity or mirth of any kind nor was anyone prompted to make any Viking jokes - it just was not that type of game.
The main mechanism of the game is the boats, each Viking boat has 3 spaces to place Vikings upon, one of which will have a colour players spot. On your turn you draw a boat the player whose spot is denoted may place a Viking on the boat, then the active player may fill the other two slots with 0, 1 or 2 of their Vikings, the player then sends the boat down one of 4 narrow fjords which have land spots which run parallel to the boats spots, the Vikings all disembark and collect the bounty in the form of strength points, victory points or a bonus point card. If you land on a spot where another Viking sits they decide whether you may displace them or not, as displacement will have an affect on scoring some thought needs to go into the defenders choice.
The sad result of all the mechanisms is a dry game of "margins" with no element of fun. Not my cup of tea but number crunchers may like it.

Initial notes, should play more than once to discover the game:
Nice graphics although a bit hard to see what's where on the peninsulae.
Some interesting and clever ideas in the gameplay.
The role of the cards might be too much; the problem is too much cards for less than four players (in our first play we didn't really get the axe at all etc.)

RATING: 7
An accessible, colorful area majority game, and not quite as far removed from its theme as I thought initially. The subtle strength of vikings residing in Walhalla, who bolster your defense and determine your viking replenishment for the next round, is especially good. A minor development snag is that ties are not handled consistently: in the raided areas, two players tied for first relegate the rest to third or lower, whereas in Walhalla, they get second place. Apart from that, smooth running even in the very first game.
Played once.

Some novel mechanics that mostly tie to the theme are this game's best features. I'm thinking of the fjord maps and the longboats. The valhalla rules are equally thematic, but I found them a little awkward in execution, and without enough swing in victory points.

Fantastic game that has sadly been overlooked by most boardgame enthusiasts! Nice theme, gorgeous illustrations, great components. The game demands some planning and strategic thinking. It also distinguished itself from an innovative rule set regarding the fighting among Vikings from different clans. The battle outcome favour both the winner as well as the loser of the battle in different ways, it's thus important to carefully analyse how the battle outcomes will affect future game play.

- Well structured rules with easy to learn rules. Still, I'd recommend you to test play it at least once with players that are new to this game, since some outcomes of card play are not grasp by only reading the rules, as is the case with battle outcome and its' consequences on Valhalla majorities!

The biggest surprise of the Essen bunch!  Can't understand the mediocre reviews, we had a blast with this.  It has very unique gameplay with some extremely unique mechanics.  And the slight negotiation factor in there is great.  My only beef is that the artwork/writing is a little difficult to understand.  There is a tad bit of area majority going on (I hate area majority), but this is NOT an area majority game.

The art is very pretty, and thematically this pastes on nicely to what is a quite abstract game, but it just isn't all that exciting.  There is a strikingly small amount of control, as the level of chaos makes for no safe spot for your pieces.  The chaos level is about as high as Tongiaki, without any of the manipulation of movement or surprises. Valhalla is clearly intended to balance all of this, but once you have majority in Valhalla you are pretty much screwed everytime you get in a fight (if you could pull people from Valhalla after clearing out all your folks from Midgard I think this would help).  

Each turn you flip over ship tiles and others may have the oportunity to join your ship, but you get to control where you put the ship and the direction.  Suddenly, the game becomes very mathy as you must evaluate all the permutations of your actions.  Others must recognize every option that the main player has when placing to evaluate if it is worthwhile, while the main player MUST math out the reprocussion of the number of pieces they use, the location that they put their piece(s) on the ship, and the locations available for their ship (and the direction).  If you don't do the math you may not get the majority (or the second majority) and you must always consider the reprocussions of Valhalla.

I just don't enjoy games that force mathing out permutations where it can all be unseated next turn by someone's folly.  Perhaps if this were played with a timer, it wouldn't be so bad, but I can definately see how A/Pers will waste a lot of time on something this ridiculously light.  

Then of course there are the randomly drawn bonus point cards...

I want to like this, but I just don't feel that there is enough control for me.

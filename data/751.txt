The rules are not 100% perfect, in the Italian translation. But it is a fine game and I think also a turning point in the history of German games.

Weird and beautiful game that was way ahead of its time, only played a few times but it was obvious the game is in need of a few houserules to really shine.

Great artwork and production values, it really is a light wargame from Ravensburger!

One of the first Euro games as we call them now. Deserves it's place in history. Some minor rules problems but a good game to play with great components.

Complete Game Material exchangend now with Deukalion, which fits pretty well for the ruleset of old school Minos. The 6 special Minos-dice fits also well into the special dice cup, and allows extra actions.

I like the idea of a simple game about ancient mediterranean cultures. However, the game is just not that good. It lacked a bit of historical background and added some uninteresting mechanics.

  The game Minos takes you back in time; build your own trading empire by crossing the Mediterranean Sea with your ships and founding new settlements and trading centers.
  The game ends when all the city sites have been settled and at least two full cities have been built. The winner is the player with the highest income at this point, as marked on the scale around the edge of the board. A tie is resolved in favor of the player with the most cash in hand.

Great game! 
Just try a few minor adjustments: 1. Fleets and troops should be worth 10 talents. 2. Each time you get a first building you also get one soldier for free. 3. Ports may never contain more than one fleet.
Great fun if you try to play it in a more diplomatic style (by offering money, building and breaking alliances and by threatening or even blackmailing your neighbours).

I played this game once, without some suggested variants to make the game proceed a little quicker.  I think it will make all the difference if I played again.  A decent game.

UPDATE: After a second playing, I found the downtime to be a little prohibitive to making the game enjoyable.  Good ideas in there though, combat was pretty random but the city building stuff was pretty cool.

OK civilisation and economics game. The possible actions in a turn are determined by dice, but as you can always reroll twice this isn't an issue. The outcome of battles is also determined with dice, but again with a nice reroll mechanism. The endgame might drag, if one player succeeds in preventing to build on the last settlement hex. Overall, conflict was rather low in our game (more of a building race). Probably an advantage for the first player.

If you want a light mediterranian civ game, play Serenissima. This one may work as a family game, definitely not as a gamer's one.

Only played with the generally suggested variants. Basically Minos is a quite simple and easy dudes-on-a-map, the dice action selection can of course be quite lucky, but it clearly has its moments and seems to have been way ahead of its time. The similar combat system is fun and gives incentive to use the arrow action, so all in all it's less random than the usual dice fest conquest would be.

4-player game with all noobs took only a bit over 90 minutes, but if we had known better what we're doing, bashing the leader would prolong it a little. The initial setup (at least using the variant) seems to be quite decisive and you need to put thought into it, so with more experience I could see myself raising the rating.

I want to enjoy this game, I like the mechanics but it has too much of the "Kingmaker" about it. Any one player can destroy anothers position - though at the cost of their own, yet you cannot expand without conflict, which means eventually someone will get picked on, not much fun for the ill favoured one.

When I played this one I got some Deja Vu... this is somehow similar to Tyros. Tyros wasn't that good, but Minos is even worse. Using dice to get actions isn't a good idea.

Based on one 3 player play. Needs the right people to play...i.e. you get to do based on dice rolling. Except for one turn where I bombed out on my Action role those went OK. Combat rolls were another matter...

I'd certainly play this again, but there are not enough new ideas and too many problems (leader breakaway, endgame) to warrant buying it - my guess is that the rating would decrease soon after some more games.

First play: Nice bits. Some Risk-like elements, but better gameplay. Actually felt like a nice mix of Settlers and Risk (Yes, that means I do prefer this to both..)

NL: ondergewaardeerd spel hier. Ideaal voor mensen die Risk en Kolonisten kennen en iets anders willen wat leuker is dan die twee spellen!

(played it once 2-player in 2005 or 2006, before I joined BGG. Logged 1 play in 2006 to keep it from my unplayed list)

This is a really nicely made, fun game.  It needs some tweaks to make it work right and requires a patient group to enjoy.  Definitely improves with the house rules around.  Downtime with four might be too much (even for me) unless there were a different victory condition (faster) or a more expansive set up.  It wouldn't take much to bring this little gem up to speed.  Since I'm a fan of Civ games it has certainly earned a spot in my collection.

An empire-building game (sort of) with a heavy dose of luck and weird, finnicky rules instead of actual depth.  Minos is extremely unstable (you can be eliminated after about ten minutes), with a combat system that can create runaway leaders (and losers) very easily.  House rules might make this a good game, but with the official ones, it's a dud.

This one surprised me. I was a little put off by the die, and after reading the rules was debating selling/trading it. However, I decided to give it a chance and I'm glad I did.

The rules need a little work, but overall it's a great game with great components and several ways to win. And the dice... they actually work pretty well adding an element of randomness to a strategy game without adding too much randomness.

This is a wonderful resource building/conquest game.  Somehow Ravensburger put out a light fun wargame.  Jean Vanaise had used his system of rolling the dice to show which actions you can do previously in Shark, but here it isn't nearly as confining (although, certainly it can hurt when you get a rare boner die roll).  

Great interaction and choices, with cities that force you to specialize them one way or another.  I love how the economic growth really creates a distinction between the early game and the mid-game.  As people encroach, buying rings (which seems absurd in the early game) now is a viable and integral option.

Best of all is the kooky combat system.  He uses this strange re-roll system that makes each choice of the die a little tense.

This game was really far ahead of it's time, but sadly you can see that the wear around the design's edges.  There are a number of house rules here on the geek.  I recommend you use them (double marching troops, Settlers set up).  I would also urge an alternative end condition, which is that if one person beats 50 income at the end of their turn and no other player is within 10 of them it is an automatic victory.  This will make the game a reasonable length.

This really is a forgotten beauty.

This game has one serious flaw: the Black sea can pretty easily be shored up and made safe from the enemy. Therefore, this player has total control over the game ending condition (all cities built).
Furthermore, I don't like free-for-all dicefests very much.

This is an excellent game with great components. It has some neat mechanisms, and although dice rolls are abundant , this is not a random/chaotic game. It has a lot of structure and strategy. It deserves a 9, but it gets a 10 because it was my favorite game as a kid.

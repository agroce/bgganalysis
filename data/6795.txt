RATING: 7
Rating based on 1 play of the basic game.
We were pleasantly surprised by how simple the game was to learn and it turned out to be great fun, including one of the single best boardgame moments for months - where a red (d20) player rolled a 1 to tackle and seriously injure a black (d8) player.
Very inventive use of the dice to give both speed and toughness.

Pros:
Silly simple fun. Sci-Fi sports theme. Nice pre-painted miniatures which can take a beating from young children. Enormous board. Good gateway game before moving onto Blood Bowl. Very cheap price. 

Cons:
Essentially roll and move. Little in the way of strategy or tactics. Only two teams.

Waiting to get a complete copy in the mail--the one I picked up at Salvo is missing the rules and the zinc foot ball.  

Pretty fun, very 'dumb' game, but plays quickly and worth picking up.  Great with beer. Awesome minis, too, though I'm not really sure what else you'd use them for.  

Increased rating to 8--this is really a superb two player game to play with casual and devoted gamers.  It is filled with dramatic upsets and the winning side is never certain until the end.

RATING: 9.99
Um, yeah, obviously I think highly of Battleball...

...so let me list its flaws.  It's out of print.  The expansions never came out.  Supposedly mass-produced and yet almost unheard-of.  And I shudder to think of what it says about me that this silly little game sits near the top of my collection.   

So those are its bad points.  

The game itself is just effin' awesome.  Looks terrific, the minis are extremely well done, the rules are stoopid simple and the gameplay is fun...fun...fun.  Totally engrossing and engaging;  you're just into it and making all these tiny little nano-decisions while marvelling at the simplistic genius of the way dice are integrated into the game.

Scored a copy from Bookman's.  It was only short a d20.  Just got in my first game with my oldest daughter.  She enjoyed it and will likely play again even though this is not her type of game.  Really nice light game.

I just have to raise this from an 8 to a 9.  My son (my regular gaming partner) always wants to play this, and it is deep enough for us to get a lot of enjoyment out of it. It is also brief enough that we can play it a lot. My oldest daughter, who typically doesn't want to play board games, was even asking if we could get in a quick game before bed time.

I might be forced to raise this to a 10 if we really dig the Advanced rules by Mrbistro.

Ameritrash sports at its finest!  Yeah, the complaints are valid: it has next to nothing to do with football.  It's a luckfest and buckets of dice.  I don't care.  It's silly and it's fun, and I'd much rather play it than some boring, multi-player solitaire, optimization puzzle with a lamebrain pasted on theme parading around as something 'elegant'.

Great minis, very colorful, attractive game.  Definitely an eye-catcher.  Quite fun, but don't expect Princes of Florence.  It's a dice fest, but a fun one.

The advanced rules imbalance things a bit, though...it seems the red team has MUCH better "special rules" than the blue team.  But feel free to ignore them, or make up your own.

Lowered the rating on this just because it hasn't hit the table in quite some time. I enjoy it, it has a clever dice mechanic, the bits are cool, and it's football with great big screaming gits -- but too many other games and it doesn't attract me like it used to.

Let me just be the millionth person to use the made-up word "dicefest" here.  Nice crome and great bits make the dice rolling fun, but I wish there were a tad less rolling and a bit more strategy.  I like it now, but can't see it coming off the shelf down the line.

a great deal for $5!  pieces are top notch, multitude of dice, epic board.  quick dicefest.  the balancing for fast/weak characters vs slow/strong characters with dice is a great example of something that is both american and elegant.  another one of those games that i'm not likely to open the box, but would play if someone else did.  i'd actually end up playing a small-box version if it existed.  mine got scrapped for parts.  with lots of varied dice and figs, the bits alone are arguably worth the current cost of entry.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
American football this is not.  It kind of brings back memories of Cyberball.  The point of the game is simple enough: it is all about picking up and delivering the football to the opponent's endzone.

The game is simplistic and is mainly about rolling dice.  There is some strategy to it, but in the end it comes down to the dice rolls.

I give the game a 6 based off the rules that it came with.

For me the charm of this game is in tweaking the game.  I feel that this game is perfect for those that are looking for a game to tweak.  The dice mechanics used in this game are pretty cool and the game uses different sided dice which makes for a very fun dice chucking experience.

Maybe not the best football game to play out there, but the miniatures are quite well done, and the plethora of different dice made to price too good to pass up.  Bought a second set at a thrift store so my boys could play with the miniatures (I kept the dice :))  My 6 year old enjoys playing with me when it's dragged out and definitely gets a kick when he destroys one of my pieces or scores the winning touchdown.  It's worth it just to see his smile!  [Sale price $4.99]

The box has a crease on the lower left hand lid, otherwise it's sturdy with very minimal shelf wear.  All pieces are present and accounted for.  In fact, this is a copy of the elusive outsert version.  The only reason I know is the outsert is being used to hold all the pieces inside the box.  The players have some notations marked in black on the bottom of their bases, along with corresponding markings on the outsert.  Nicely kept set.

RATING: 8
Simple and easy rules paired with quick and strategic gameplay make this an excellent sports tabletop game. Mostly a combo of rugby and football, the main catch (see what I did there?) with this game is that your guys have different colored bases, and these correspond to which die they roll both to move and to tackle, with lower numbers being better for tackling. This means that the faster guys are inherently worse at tackling which is completely thematic, but super simple at the same time. 

If you've ever had an itch for tabletop football, this is my best recommendation. Also it's pretty cheap to pick up on amazon.

I dont love the turn structure, (i.e. you move, I move, choosing any guy) as it just seems you use the best guys over and over till they are tackled. Also, I dont love how the throwing rules are based solely on the receiver. But, all in all, a fine 15 min romp with neat bits.

PROS: Great components, simple mechanics, fun beer & pretzel gameplay. Lots of potential for house rules. Inexpensive. CONS: A bit too much randomness even for B&P.

For $4.95 one of the best bargains in my collection!  Wouldn't have given this a second look in the store, but BGG steered me right to it.

Saw this in Toys R Us back in 2004.  HAD to have it.  I actually bought two because they were having a B1G1 sale and I wanted to keep one sealed up and pristine.  And it still is.  Of course, like most of these games: never got a game in.

This is a fun game to play with my teenage son and his friends.  I wish they would have come up with more teams and turned it into a Blood Bowl lite.  Pretty good for a game that was released in the mainstream retail stores.  I'm sure my son would rate it higher.

Cute, low-complexity dice fest.  Great to play with kids.  As others have said, it is ripe for creating house rules to make the game more &quot;advanced&quot;.

RATING: 8
This withstood the test of time with me. Still fun to play, and probably always will be. It's certainly no brainbuster though, but sometimes brainless fun is called for. It REALLY shines with Mr. Bistro's Advanced Rules. Check the Battleball files section if you're unfamiliar with this variant. Toss a thumb and a some GeekGold his way if you like it (which you will).

Fun sporty press your luck game. The hand-off, pass, fumble and malfunction rules add quite a bit to the game, although it seems strange to be unable to complete a pass into the end zone. Nice pieces, but it takes up quite a bit of room to play.

I classified this game as "guilty fun".  I didn't expect to have as much fun playing it considering it's a Wal-Mart MB game!  My brother and I were yelling and having a good time with it though when things got rolling.  Very quick to learn and open to some interesting house rules.  We found ourselves playing it well into the night while the Xbox was in the corner collecting dust.

This game is a silly football dicefest.  I love the different powers of the players; some have speed, some have strength.  It's kind of fun to watch a running back zip down the field only to get plowed by a huge lineman.

Plus, the quality of the components is great, especially for the $20 it originally costed at Toy R Us.  A must decent buy for any football/dice fest fan!

Cool game with awesome minis. Unfortunately the core game suffers from being largely broken, but there is a kernel of a good game in there, and with some house rules (found here on BGG), the game becomes much better.

I didn't like this game at all, but my husband liked it and says it's what he expected based on the presentation of the game.  If you can find this cheap, you get alot of cool dice with it.  The game rewards low die rolls.  Different pawns roll different dice.  A pawn that rolls a 20-sided die can run a long way in one turn, but gets beat in a fight.  A pawn that rolls a 6-sided die moves slowly but wins fights.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Great fast game.  I had a blast playing it with my 8 year old son.  I think the heavy tackles are a bit overpowered and could use some taiming.  But that is my opinion.

If you like Blood Bowl or a good miniature game that plays fast and easy to setup, check out Battleball.

RATING: 6.5
Fun game.  If you&#039;ve played Blood Bowl you&#039;ll recognize some similarities, but its quicker to play.  If you want more control over your team composition and style, go with Blood Bowl.  But if you&#039;re looking for a fun bash-em up game with football as a theme, you&#039;ll like this just fine - plus it costs a lot less and the dudes are already painted!   The figs could easily be used for other sci-fi games as well.

RATING: 7
Fun!  This game is all about gleeful, bash-em-up, light, lucky football fun.  I can access that part of my humanity. There are a lot of decisions to make that seem to matter.  Clearly the rule of the die is here for decision, drama and to keep things fast and simple.  I think if your expectations are in the right mode this is good fun. I wouldn't mind playing this intoxicated, either.  Thanks very much to Mr. Grey for the gift.  (Update: I want to try the basic rules of the Short Dice variant posted here, with 6 players on a side, and "blocking" not elimination unless the target has the ball.  This variant could even lead to using a 4 downs rule that works...?)

I despise American football but this game was quite fun...takes a cue from Formula De with each position having a different movement dice.  I really liked the special rules each time has and also he mass carnage that seems to result each half.  The carnage tokens are a great mechanic- tackle somebody and their debris stays where it is as an obstacle.  Overall, a simple and fun game but it is all about rolling dice.

It's not the best designed game, but I have a blast playing it with my 8 year old brother. There's some strategy involved but mostly it's luck in rolling the dice.

I don't know why, but I loved the heck out of this dicefest, even though my six year old beats me!  Cool bits help, but the overall play does feel a bit like football, and I feel like a coach going with certain strategies.  Yes, a bad dice roll can really muck up your plans, but that's not dissimilar to a coach calling a play in football, and then the tailback missing the block on the blitzing safety....

Hey, I want expansions!

This is a surprisingly fun game to play.  I am not a big sports guy...at all, and my 4 year old daughter certainly is not.  She has requested this one eagerly since my first play with her.

I would enjoy playing this with other adults if the opportunity arose.

This is a surprisingly enjoyable game that I'd play anytime.  The neatest thing about it is the dice mechanic.  Big, slow tackles get a d6, while the fastest guys have a d20.  Rounding out the middle are d8, d10 and d12 players.  To move a player, you roll their die and they move that many spaces.  However, when players from opposite teams meet, they roll, and the LOW roll wins.  Very elegant and effective.  The game is simple to learn, and play is fast and brutal.  Love it for what it is!

Good game, but is seriously hampered by lack of team diversity.  A few expansions should help, as well as some house rules.  It is fun though, if you get into it.  Dice rolls swing the game, but they swing both ways in the long run.

I mainly rate it high because for $20 (or maybe even $10) you get good value out of it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

RATING: 4
Every now and then I like a good mindless dicefest, and this game certainly qualifies.  However the problem is, it mixes all that wacky dicing with some pseudo-strategic elements, which in the end, are tedious and obvious.  Every game boils down to a big mass attrition of tackle after tackle, until the player with the last man standing wins.  If the outcome is any different, it's because one player was plagued with a run of really bad rolls.  Components are really great.

Played 3 times. I am glad I bought it, but it is very random indeed. One thing I don't like is that incomplete passes, according to the rules, are moved by the opponent who can then move the ball in the opposite direction. That bothers me a lot! I may discar that rule. Any suggestions to that? ((Bought from Target; sold at con because it was dicey and didn't feel sporty enough.))

RATING: 4
A fast, fun football game that can be eerily like the real thing sometimes (see your star linebacker go down and out). The myriad dice rolls make this a random game, but the presence of multiple players with differing base dice make it more of a statistical beast. After all, you are perfectly justified in expecting your d6 light tackle to beat up the d20 running back most of the time. Everyday football strategy seems to translate surprisingly well. I've had success with both a Trips formation (three d20s on one wing in an overload - great for passing, with a couple of d8s blocking downfield, slot the heavy tackle for effect), and with an I-formation smash-mouth strategy (give the ball to a d8, have the d6 and 2d6 block downfield, with the d20s running on the wings as options). Much fun! Just keep in mind that this is a kiddie game and nothing seriously great, something on the order of Battle Cry, Memoir '44 and Heroscape.

I REALLY high rating for a pure dice fest. But I give the 8 because this one is really FUN! It's low on strategy, but makes up for it in the sheer delight of playing. Further, it takes me back to my boyhood days, and it's a SPORTS game. I haven't played sports games in ages. I won my copy at GulfGames XII, selecting it as my number one pick at the prize table after playing a great game with Stephen Glenn.

Like Heroscape, here is another game that's dynamite for kids under age 12, but sucks for an adult.  Please play Blood Bowl instead.  I mean, really.  Got mine for $5 on clearance at TRU.  For that price, good to have if kids come by.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating after one play--surprised at how much fun this is, and reading the rules and looking at the figures I had already expected it to be a fairly fun little game.

With two older more experienced players, it's fun to watch the plays developing.  And while there's tons of dice, strong formations and playing the odds are key.  And don't underestimate the strength of the passing game!

People recommend this for kids, but there's enough beer and pretzels fun for older sports fans that I think they'll enjoy the diversion.  This is probably the best sports-related board or minis game I've played, with the exception of Sportsclix...but that's a different target audience anyway.

Ranking may change, but I could see this falling in the same camp as Epic Duels, a game I haven't tired of yet.

Go buy this game--the minis and dice alone are worth the price, and there's a not-shabby game to go with it.  For the clearance prices it's going for, there's no reason not to have this in your collection.


EDIT:  Have played this three more times, and the rating stands--a firm 7.  

EDIT:  Played again, and while it's still fun you start to see that it would get old after awhile.  Pick it up, play with your kids or a friend who's not a gamer but is a sports fan.

RATING: 8.5
A good simple sports action game.  Sure, it&#039;s mostly based on luck, but it moves so quickly and capitalizes on the general football asthetic so well, it&#039;s hard not to love it.  Now if they simply spring for the NFL license, we can all play as our favorite teams with cyborg enhancements.  Of course, that would probably mean doubling the very reasonable pricetag, but it&#039;d be a lot of fun.

The only design flaw I&#039;ve noticed is the lack of contrast between the board and the carnage markers.  The whole board could stand to have higher contrast (i.e.- white line markers and clearer space dilineation).  All in all, a good mass market title.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Pretty much picked this up because it is one of the last great games from MB, one of my favourite game companies. Sadly, it just doesn't for me as I was looking for something a little less luck-filled. Either the dice would feel too luck-filled for my likes or you could have enough control over how and when they are used to make the game a bit more strategic. But overall, I felt luck ruled the day. Unless you have a d6 facing off against a d20- sure, there's better odds that a player with a d6 will beat a d8 (going for lowest roll) but it's not enough to really feel like the luck evens itself out over time, especially with how short this game can be.  Definitely opportunities for tactics, but they are very, very easy to determine. That being said, it's better than most games designed for kids, even if the theme ignores the interest of the majority of kids.

Battleball could have been such a much better game that it was.  I think if the field was much narrower it would have been a lot more fun to play.  As it comes out of the box ... it is impossible to actually plan a defense that works as you don't have enough men to cover the field and this fact alone makes the game frustrating for more experienced players of games like Blood Bowl, Street Bowl or Elfball

This is a great game to play with younger kids (6-12).  Easy to learn yet offers enough variety to build up some strategy. Found my game at a local thrift store for a few bucks.  I've created two of my own custom teams using an extra Battleball set I found, a couple of Heroscape figures, and some FixitSculpt.  Created new team cards using Gimp and some of my own custom rules and modifications of Mr. Bistro's MVP rules.  Will try to upload photos at some point.

Simple game with great components.  The player figurines are very detailed and are pre-painted. Lots of different dice and a very nice chrome futuristic football pawn.

If you know football tactics, definitely read some of the rule variants posted here.

A pretty good game for kids and adults to enjoy together. Just enough strategy to keep the adult interested, while dicey enough that kids can sometimes beat their parents. And of course the super components are a plus. Kind of the spiritual successor to the old Ideal All Pro Football game, but this one is more fun. When copies were being blown out I bought another copy for a second set of dice, and cut up the figures to make casualty piles to replace the cardboard counters provided by the game.

Really quite good, and can often be had very cheaply. Beautiful and plenteous components. Believe it or not, there are actually different strategies. Because you can win by scoring touchdowns or by killing everyone, you have to balance both.

This game is OK, with a little more love I think it could have been something really special, that is what Mr. B.'s Rules are for, makes it a fun game, more like American football then rugby.   Gives it more strategy, and a little more depth.  Still heavily lucked based, but not as bad as the original rules!   I rate it a 8 with Mr. B. advanced rules!   But that is because I keep wanting to play again and again, and I think it is a great intro to odd dice games ( for people who have never used the D20, D12, D10, & D8 ), break em in on an easy game before you hit them up with other games that use dice besides the D6.   I am teaching a lot of newbies this one, and they all love it( gamers and non gamers alike ).  They all want to play another one right away!6-18-08 2-2 vrs Jon/

I bought this game for five bucks on clearance (soon learning why) and played a few times.  The game is clearly a dicefest in every sense of the phrase.

RATING: 5
I don't know if I'll ever play this game, but to me it was worth 5$ just to scrap for parts.  Let's see, 22 decent minis for possible conversion into Heroscape and a bunch of extra (if a little plain) polyhedral dice.  If the game ends up to be at all playable with my young nephews then it was more than worth the fiver.


Update:  I tried it out and there isn't a lot to be excited about.  It is slower and less entertaining than Pizza Box Football.  However, the colored dice mechanic governing both speed and tackling ability is a nice way to streamline this game.  Purely as a kids game, this would rate an 8 or 9.

Blood Bowls little brother.I used to own blood bowl and loved it but it was tough to get to the table as it took long to play.This is pretty easy to learn and shorter so it is pretty easy to introduce people to.Pretty much a dice fest but there is a little strategy.The passing game never seems to work that good.

Very fun as it is but I do ignore the "out til the half" tackle rule. Instead, they are out for the same amount of turns as a d6 roll, players can come back in between the 10 and 20yd lines, but only if I choose to move them during my turn.

A lot more fun than I expected! A tremendous dicefest, of course, but the amazing swings of fate are what make this game a blast.

The game is simple enough to start out with these rules on your first play.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (February 2015)

Battleball was one of my oldest unplayed games. I never really wanted to play it but on 2015 I made the commitment to play all my games, so it hit the table and I had fun playing it :D.

It isn't a deep game by any stretch of the imagination, but it is certainly gorgeous (its main appeal). The miniatures are very well done and the game board is huge. I have only played the basic version in which the decisions you take are, in most cases, irrelevant. That is, the game has lots and lots of uncontrollable luck. I also don't enjoy sport themed games but surprisingly I enjoyed Battleball. It is very fast paced and I really like to injury my opponent's players. 

Bottom line, Battleball is not a game I would like to play often but for now I'm keeping it. Next time I will try the advanced rules. 

Current Rating: 4.0

I owned this game for YEARS before playing it. There was a tournament at an annual game day that Erik Arneson throws. What an amazing gem. I can't stand football (or any sport really). But this game is edge-of-your-seat the whole way through. I am amazed how much fun it is. Very quick but quite clever. Back and forth throughout. You are certain that you've lost, but the tides turn, and it doesn't feel like just dumb luck. Fun. Fun!

I like this game.  Trying to maximize the probability of each move is fun, and each game is always close, or in my case seems to end with just about everyone on my team wiped out - this just adds to the tension.  Lucky rolls can/will win games, but that doesn't stop this one from being fun.

5/27/2016: Such a silly and casual game. Not a ton of decisions in this one and there is a HUGE degree of randomness and luck, but that is part of what makes it so fun. This game is genuinely enjoyable to play and makes my bust out laughing each time I play it.

This is just a fun simple game.  Your players have different colored bases.  Each base corresponds to a different type of dice.  On offense the bigger dice allow you to potentially move farther.  On defence you want to roll smaller to stay alive.  So the bigger dice are not as good at that.  I think it is a fun balance.  Yes there is luck involved.  However it is still a lot of fun and you can knock a game out in just a few minutes.

This game rocks, the regular rules are lacking, but if you download Mr. Bistro's Advanced rules you have a amazing game that is really fun.  He is just adding to the rules, mainly so you can move 3 guys per turn.  But it adds so much to the game, I would rate it a 5 for the standard game - and an 8 with the advanced rules.  I didn't like this one at first, not being a dice person, but after a few plays I like it more and more.  I love teh figures base color matching the dice you use for it, very smart concept to use!

Picked up in Jan 2006

Played quite a few times over the 2010 holiday season with my 5 year old. The basic game was fine for introducing the basic play, but it wasn't long before he could handle the Battleball Advanced rules, at least without the league play rules. So overall, it's quite good. The luck factor is a little too high to make it anything more than a light beer and pretzels game, but for youngsters, it's a great system.

Game in a Nutshell: Use dice to move, tackle, and pass in order to be the first to two touchdowns.

Played as: Two-player only; advanced, non-team rules.

Pros: Nice set of miniatures and big playing field make it fun. The open field provides one of the more dynamic roll-and-move experiences in a game. Easily taught mechanics make it great to explain and go. The piles of destruction that are littered across the field following 'tackles' give players something small to adapt to as the game progresses.

Cons: The game takes longer then I thought it would or should as both sides jockey for position. The luck factor can become frustrating when critical injuries happen or the wildly swinging possibilities of movement rolls. Strategy plays a much smaller roll then I'd like to see.

Other: I'd like to try the team-play rules to see if it adds anything to the strategy as well as downloading the expanded advance rule-set here on the geek.

Best Use: For boys around 10 years old.

Nifty concept for player types (different dice types for different positions - i.e. d20 for receiver, d12 for running back, etc.), very easy and quick. Not really football so much as rugby, but fun to play with my daughter. I admit I also like it...

RATING: 6
Mostly luck, but it has nice bits and is quick and easy to learn. It's good as a filler or for filling an entire evening with quick, light-hearted fun. The game seems very tweakable (if you're into that sort of thing). It would be very easy, for example, to make some simple substitution rules. It definitely would benefit from a couple additional player types, to add variety and flexibility to your lineup and add to the strategic element. I did take a look at the fan-created advanced rules, and it was serious overkill. Add some substitutions and some special abilities--done! Kids certainly love the look of this game, and my 14-year-old cousin enjoyed it a great deal. It's kind of strange to just play to one score per half, with an overtime if necessary. That can seem a little anti-climactic, but I guess it's necessary to keep the game short. This is definitely one of those games about which the "luck fest" complaint is irrelevant--it is what it is, and it's just some silly fun.
One thing that I highly recommend that works because the game is so short...play four quarters, plus an overtime (if necessary). It will seem more like a football game, as opposed to just a game with a football theme.

The huge board that comes with the game is really cool.  The game mechanics, however, leave much to be desired.  I've been debating over whether it might be worth my time and effort to come up with new mechanics to make this less of a "luck fest" and instead add a bit more strategy to the game.  It seems like with just a bit of imagination, that this game could become something that would be fun to play.  In its current state, it is not.

Surprisingly good "combat football" game with interesting use of dice for combat and move.  Faster players roll bigger dice to move and fight, but combat is low score wins.  Not a true replacement for Blood Bowl, but not a bad game on its own.  Advanced version adds a couple of team specific rules.

Got it at Geekway 2006.  I've played with Simon (six years old) a couple of times, and he really likes it a lot.  Here's an interesting thing about kids.  I think that it's sort of silly to teach a kid to play a game with pieces that he enjoys playing with more than playing the game.  The whole point of playing a game is establishing a system of rules to overlie actual child-like play.  Nobody comes up with "rules" for how to play GI Joe action figures until they're older.  Board games are our way of continuing to play pretend or play with toys with our friends, but with a system in place to arbitrate so it doesn't devolve into, "I shot that guy!"  "You did not!"  etc.  Anyway, this is the first game that Simon started needing "rules" to be able to enjoy, which indicates to me that he's finally crossing over into true gamer territory.  Now I have to teach him strategy.

A typical American style game, lots of dice, and lots of luck.  The futuristic American football theme doesn't translate very much to the gameplay, and it's basically a game of kill the player with the ball.  Not for those who prefer high strategy, but can be fun on occasion as long as it's not taken too seriously.  If you can find this at a thrift store for $5 or so it's worth the purchase.

Great, dice-infused romp of a game. It's roll and move with a slightly innovative combat system using different sided dice, which doesn't sound that great, but it really is.

I've picked this up at a thrift store a couple of times, and would love to find it again.

My older boys' uncle got them this game when they were pretty young, but he never sat down and showed them how to play. Since Hasbro made it, I just assumed that it was no good and never paid any attention to it. The boys ended up playing with the little men inside the box and of course managed to lose some of the guys, the dice, the markers, the rules, etc. 

Eventually I read about the game on BGG and discovered many people think it's a pretty good game. I had managed to salvage the field boards and some of the players from the original set, but also traded for a good, used copy (October 2010). I like the mayhem aspect, and of course the bits add a lot to it. Got my then-11-year-old son to play it by December of 2010, and he seemed to like it. 

This seems to me to be a winner for boys of all ages. I'd say as soon as a kid can deal with a dice roll not going his way, this is a game they can enjoy playing. Therefore, this is probably a better game to teach kids who are probably somewhere between 8 and 11 or so.

UPDATE 4/17 - This game is a blast to play with Mr. Bistro's "Battleball Advanced" rules. Takes about all the fun (for me) of BloodBowl and distills down to a great time frame. 

I really, really want to play a league of some kind.

Previous review - Kinda "BloodBowl Lite", but without all the tedius rules or the pain in the ass of painting the minis (which I do like when completed, but still a PITA) or the trying to find a BB League, or the paperwork of recording your team's stats. 

Essentially, 95% of the fun of BloodBowl, but boiled down to a real decent time-frame. Easy to jump people into it.  

I wish they had taken it further and developed additional special teams for this game.  Game was marketed towards children vs. adults-which was their mistake. Pick it up if you see it!

*ALSO-these minis are great for modding for custom Heroscape and other games. Using these in particular, I made a very good (I feel) unit of Gladiatrons for Heroscape:

$3 thrift store find. Worth it for the cool miniatures and DnD dice alone. The actual game is a sloggy dicefest, but the game actually embraces that fact and runs with it instead of hiding behind this 'simulation' garbage that most sports games use to justify cumbersome and unengaging mechanics. The rules are fairly simple to understand, which is a huge plus, even if the game isn't super-deep. As-is, it's nothing to write home about, but it's about as good as it could have been considering what it promised.

Hey sports fans! Love football but don't think it's violent enough? Battleball is [i]for you![/i] 

Honestly it's been so long since I've played this that I have no informed opinion on what I actually think about it. Evidently I've played it at least twice and apparently didn't [i]absolutely[/i] hate it since I rated it a four. However, I didn't love it enough to not place it in the attic with the rest of the games I picked up from local thrift stores back when I was briefly convinced that I might actually find something good there if I just looked hard enough (and I did of course in the form of the VHS tape that comes with the old Dragon Strike adventure game).

But I digress. I'm sure this is a fine two-player game if you like football and want to experience an ultra-violent version in board game form. Sadly, I have neither of those predilections.

I was hoping this would be like a blood bowl lite and give me a minimalistic blood bowl experience in about 30 minutes. After a couple of games I realized that this does not satisfy my blood bowl itch and both of my games took closer to an hour. I'm sure if I played it more the game would go a little faster and I do like the mechanic where you roll the dice that match the color of the players base.  This is one of those games that I'm happy to have in my collection to introduce people to the concept of a football board game.  Then once they've had a taste of this I'll gear them up for blood bowl.

I picked this up for cheap at a Toys R Us several years ago thinking it would be a good game to play with my sons when they got older.  Well, its several years later now and I must say it has fulfilled its purpose.

Battleball is an enjoyable "football in the brutal future" game.  The game comes with a good number of plastic minis that impressed the boys.  Figurine bases are color coded to match certain positions like running back, linebacker, safety, etc.  Players roll dice to move their players across the field, attempting to score two touchdowns.  The dice are colorcoded to position, so some characters move faster than others.  When players meet on the field they try to tackle each other, and roll the same dice to determine outcome.  A cool mechanic is that the lower number rolled wins, so slower moving characters are "stronger" and more likely to tackle speedy guys.

The rules are a bit simple, and don't quite give me the feel of American football (more like a brutal version of what I call soccer, but the rest of the world calls football ;) ).  That would be my main complaint so far.

However, I recently found the advanced ruleset on BGG by mrbistro.  These rules look really neat and seem to make the game a bit more like American football - we plan on our next game being "advanced".  My 6 rating is based on the fun I have had so far with basic ruleset - I may bump this a little higher if the advanced rules improve the game as much as I hope they do.

Reminiscent of Epic Battles and Formula De, and Blood Bowl (without all the tedium that went with that game.)  Price is amazing if you buy at Target or Toys R Us.  Would rate higher but replay value may diminish after a while.  For now - great fun and certainly a great buy!

The figures are the best part of the game.  My daughter got into this game for a short time when she was 11.  We had a blast playing.  The figures are awesome.

One was bent, so I put it in boiling water to soften it up, bent it into shape and dropped it into ice water.   Works great now.

Global football has moved beyond the restrictive rules of the US Football League. Physical enhancements have made the sport more intense and more deadly. Players have developed distinctive skills to overpower enemy players. Some are fast. Some are strong. All are out to eliminate their opponents.

Plan your strategy to get safely into the end zone. Your opponent will do everything he can to destroy your players and take possession of the ball. Can you overpower them and score a touchdown? Score two touchdowns and you'll be the battleball champ!

Fun with kids and has some light strategy with lots of luck.  Recommended.

I didn't expect to enjoy this game as much as I did.  I'm not a big sports fan, and this really doesn't play like a sports game.  It seems to me more like a VERY light strategic wargame with 1 goal in mind...scoring touchdowns.  I got this game for $5 at Toy Works and it was a pretty good buy.

Picked this one up cheap on eBay ('Buy it Now' after I had won an auction from the same seller, for combined shipping). I had read that it's similar to Blood Bowl, but much simpler. Very accurate description, actually. 

It's sort of a pick up and play version of Blood Bowl. The theme is gone, as is much of the strategy, but it manages to add some innovative tweaks (different dice colors for different characters) and keeps the overall fun factor intact.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
For a rather simplistic player-level football game, this is actually pretty good. Because I wanted something that I thought would be more strategic, this got fired by 1st and Goal. However, I was ultimately disappointed by that game's independence of actual football strategy and its sheer reliance on the "knowing that I know that you know that I know" attempt to "outthink" the other coach. I'm hoping that Techno Bowl (pre-ordered as of the time of this writing) will bridge the gap between the two and finally give me a football game I will truly enjoy.

As Tom Wasell whould put it: fun, fun, fun. Simple strategy, nice miniatures, lots of dicerolling, carnage and suspence: is my dice with me, am I going to score? No I make a pass, and score. YES!

RATING: N/A
Decent fun. Quick to pick up, fast-playing, but not necessarily quick to finish. The original game has a bit too little choice to it, much remedied by the advanced rules. I always dig color-matched dice, it's such a simple way to bring a little variance into a game. I knew after a handful of games though that for its footprint, time and depth, something else would outlive it.

Fun futuristic football simulation. I'd like to try a variant that limits the amount of turns people can make, and if that limit is reached there is a turnover of some sorts. Otherwise, the game is prone to having people turtle and the game can drag.

3/2/10 - Battleball is a great game. 10 yr old nephew really liked it too. I think the board could have been a bit smaller... game seems a bit long sometimes. Looking forward to trying the advanced fan rules.

7/9/10 - These games have a fun theme and cool pieces, but unless you can enjoy a dice fest they don't have a high replay value. 

12/21/10 - Used some advanced rules such as blocking and 3 moves per turn. Really liked blocking... Not sure if I like 2 moves better or 3 per turn. Still need to try kick-offs and alternate passing rules.

This is a fun game, but it's not what I'd call deep strategy. It seems to be heavily imbalanced in favor of the Wild Harts when using the team rules.  The game is dependent on a lot of die rolls - dice for movement, tacking, passing, handoff, etc.

An interesting, if very light, take on a game of football.  While there is a hefty dose of luck in the game given the die-rolling, there is enough room for some interesting tactical, even strategic playing.  The match-ups you choose, as well as how you choose to arrange yourself on the field, are important in how well you can potentially do.  However, the dice can be capricious.  If you have low tolerance for this, please stay away.  However, if you can handle the dice and not descend into analysis paralysis, this game can be a lot of fun.  Of course, if you overthink what is going on, this game can easily overstay its welcome.  As an aside, this can be an excellent game to play with half your mind while you are watching the real thing.

Bought this on sale at Toys R Us, figuring it was perfect for my 7-year-old. And while it is, it has an allure for this still-a-kid dad. Yes, it's virtually strategy-free, and the big draw is the plastic figures. But it plays fast, the system is easy to learn, it's wide open to rules variants (check out its Geek listing), and the smash-mouth tactics will appeal to your inner child, especially if it likes pulling the wings off flies.

For sheer silly dice chucking fun in 20 minutes, it's hard to beat Battleball. The fact that it's cheap and has a huge board, painted miniatures helps.

Hasbro has eliminated complications of passing and movement by allowing players to only 1) Move one player per turn, 2) Tackles result in elimination of one or both players involved. This works if you don't take the game seriously.

Those wanting a more realistic and Blood Bowl like experience should use all the advanced rules, come up with their own houserules or just play Blood Bowl.

Wow!  What a surprise.  I really didn't expect much out of this game. I don't care at all about football, and really how much game do you expect to see from Hasbro, but this is a wonderful light system.  The balance between the movement from the dice vs the passing and attack is very elegant.  Sure there is an absurd amount of luck, but it really is all about skillfully moving your pieces around.  Plus, it is fun just to smash into each other. 

Lots of drama and comebacks.

Battleball isn't something that I would be clamoring to pull out all of the time, but I really enjoyed my outing with it, and I think it's a great dice-fest for two people that like to go head-to-head.

2 Players. Half luck, half strategy. About as complex as Heroscape, so it's easy to learn. It's basically Blood Bowl lite. The mini's are well done. Gameplay is fast an furious, and is the most enjoyable football game I've played. Even non-football fans can get into this one.

This was one of the first games I played that wasn't either Risk, Monopoly, Life, or Clue. It was the gateway I passed through which lead me into the world of board games. 

Nostalgia aside, I really like this game. It moves a bit slow, but the theme perfectly suits the game flow. Watching the players slam together and turn into piles of wreckage is so satisfying. The components are top notch. All of the detailed miniatures really make the game come to life. 

The mechanisms that move the game along work fine. The large collection of dice and how they effect running and tackling allow for some very strategic decision making. You are a slave to the dice, however. You can have a perfect line-up and driving strategy, but the dice will sometimes cause your plan to go awry. But the varying players and strategies you can apply will counter the randomness a bit, as there is usually a way to adapt according to the dice rolls. 

It is a simple game with easy-to-understand rules and mechanisms. If you can find a copy and you like sports or action games, I would give this one a try.

Very light, yet fun. Its just a super short and simple dice game with some fun parts and its um, kinda like football.

The basic game can be played by a 5-year old. You pick a guy and roll the matching die. When you are next to another player, you both roll to fight, and the lower die wins. Thus you move fast and are easy to beat, or move slow, but can survive a lot of fights. Its a super simple and yet brilliant system. It also makes for a quick playing fight fest.

Ameritrash at its finest!!! A whole bunch of dice, very simple combat/mechanics, and a sci-fi/sports theme!

I can tell I'm going to have fun with this game. I found it at a thrift store, and was captured by the art. I can't believe this was made it 2003, it looks much newer than that. I saw a review saying if Fantasy Flight put this out, it would be a hit... and I totally agree! I love that they even included away to give each team its own rule to make it asymmetrical. 

I wish I found this sooner!

RATING: 7
A fun and fast-playing little gem. There is a decent dose of tactics diluted with a healthy portion of luck. The only thing that bothers me about this one is how poorly it simulates whole teams running up and down the field, it's more like "one or two guys from each team will take turns running while every else stands there until needed." I'm sure there are good variants to alleviate this, although I haven't tried any yet, but it is a purely thematic complaint. If you enjoy lighter 2-player ameritrash this is a must have, if not you should probably still try it.

The "sport" really comes through in this fairly simple game.  There are multiple tactics for players to chose from and the components are great.

I am a big fan of Football Fever and I think this does a lot of what that does, but instead of abstracting the players you control them. This, of course, would be long and tedious with an actual football simulation so Battleball is certainly a different sport. Sort of a Mash-up of football and football (soccer).

Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1

Thank you so much to Kevin Duffy (Grildensnork), who was generous enough to send me a copy of this after seeing my post on a recent GeekList (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/16641) lamenting my inability to find as many good sales as everyone else.  I'm looking forward to trying this one out soon.  After recently rediscovering my tolerance for dice with Can't Stop, Liar's Dice, StreetSoccer and Nexus Ops, I'm even more interested in giving this one a go.  I somewhat accidentally traded this away in a math trade for two copies of Treehouse, one of which I have since traded for Chopstick Mega Dexterity Challenge 3000, and then just re-purchased Battleball so I can play it again.

This is an ok game, probably better to play with kids or non-gamers who like football. . .the game lacks any assemblance of complex strategy as you're constrained to what you roll on the dice. . .sometimes if one player gets lucky they can roll twice and score and finish a half in 2-3 turns. . .

I am happy to own this game, especially since it is hard to come by in Europe. As it is, the game is perfect for me. It is not any more random than, say, Heroscape or some of the other, more popular, games with painted minis. Sure, you can opt to lower the luck by using the rules found here on the Geek, but if I want something more meaty, I would bring Blood Bowl to the table instead. With the printed rules (make sure to include the rules for passing) the game plays like a video game with very quick turns and lots of drama with so many dice rolls. Also, this way it is perfectly playable with my 7 year old son. He likes it even more than I do.

Had high hopes for this one after reading the rules, but one play was pretty disappointing.  There's strategy here, but the winner comes down almost exclusively to luck.  If you tackle better than your opponent, you will almost certainly win, and you can't do enough to tilt the odds in your favor.  Still, the figures are amazing, and this would be a great fit for a couple kids.  Has all kinds of wow factor.

It's luck-driven and chaotic, but it still rewards planning and strategy.

It's always fun to watch the players move up and down the field, getting crushed under Bruno's feet!

You can complain that there is no depth to this game---so what? This is the definition of a beer n' Pretzels game with at least one pitcher. A great game to get your young one started on as well.

Battleball is Blood Bowl lite. It has some clever mechanics, specifically the way it uses polyhedral dice. Big guys roll D6's or D8's to determine how many spaces they can move, while skill guys roll D12's or D20's. The clever part is that the same dice are used for both movement and blocking. In a block, both player's roll the appropriate die and the lower number wins. Essentially, guys with big dice are blazing fast but are usually very easy to knock down.

The game moves super fast and usually teams just take turns knocking out opposing guys until one side can't be stopped from scoring. I've tried to run "plays" like I do in Blood Bowl, but it just doesn't work. Everyone moves too fast and the straight die comparison used in the tackling mechanism can be pretty unpredictable. In the end, it's tactically pretty lame...but it's still fun enough to play with the kids or to bash out a quick game while waiting for a meatier game to start.

I held off buying this because it struck me as being a blatant rip-off of Blood Bowl.  But when I found it for $5, I dismounted from my high horse and purchased it.  I'm quite glad I did.

Yes, it's similar to BB, but there's enough differences to warrant being considered as its own game.  After all, not every WWII game or Civil War game or card game are rip-offs of each other just because they share a common theme.

The box is packed with cool bits.  The figures look nice (and don't need to be painted(!!!)).  It has lots of colorful dice of varying types.  The rules are simple to learn and teach.  In fact, because of all of the above, it's very easy to coax someone into playing a game of it.

One minor aspect is a fantastic design decision.  The color of the base of each figures matches the color of the die to be rolled when that figure moves, is involved in a tackle, etc.  This simple matchup means that there's no need to look up each player's abilities on a chart to decide what to do when two of them square off against each other.  Very nice.

Another plus is that it's NOT collectible.  This means I don't have to keep shelling out piles of money to get the latest team or star players to be competitive.  I paid my $5, and I have a complete game.  Nice.

This isn't a complex game. But it's a fun one.  And that's more than enough for me.

GAME: The Dwarves
RANK: 2193
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A cool fantasy coop that is simple enough and interesting enough to play for the next 2h (play time is a bit longer). Played it only in simplest mode and I think it gets almoust impossible to play if the level of difficulty is greater.

Its a dice fest so its a bit more light hearted and fun in comparison to Pandemic. However you will still need to puzzel the objectives carefully. Also I think most of the Adventures need to be ignored in order to finish the game in time and focus on the scenarios and threats.

The alpha player symptome is not strongly present, because of scenario objectives that in most of the cases tell you exactelly what to do. The Adventure cards give you more freedome, and because there is a lot of luck in the game, the alpha player may not be as potent in telling you which Adventure you should go for.

The components are beautifull!

This is a gorgeous and well produced game - but it is quite simplistic in implementation. In general, the Quests do not offer up much variety - which is a significant complaint. In many ways, this is an introductory co-op because of this simplicity. But it does play very well. I enjoy the overwhelming feeling of creatures pouring into the land. It is quite easy to beat on the easy level, so I'll be ramping it up next time. I like it well enough!

It doesn't scale too well for fewer player numbers (cause you need to move more and are limited in your other actions).

Because it retells the story of the book, it stays same-y and somewhat lacks variety.
If you always keep you "Rat der Zwerge" (Dwarven council) high on Balendilin's side it becomes a lot easier.

RATING: 4
A modest game taking its inspiration from the umpteenth unoriginal fantasy book series, The Dwarves looks and feels like your typical euro-fashioned ripoff of the best cooperatives around: in fact, as you’d expect in a German game, it’s all about its streamlined game mechanics whereas theme is kept to a minimum.

This gets even too evident as far as the materials are concerned: apart from the five characters’ miniatures, they didn’t even bother to come up with something fancier and sightly more attractive than differently colored and sized wooden cubes to stand for the different kinds of foes, which kills any attempt at immersing into the setting.

As far as the game plays, The Dwarves is just decent, nothing more: in fact, even in the dead of the game you never feel concerned with the events nor compelled to stop the evil cubes’ invasion. To tell the truth, you don’t even care about the outcome, whatever it is: you only play to reach the end soon and see what happens next, with no emotional transport.

As usual, never trust a whatever-themed eurogame: will betray your trust. [i](November 2012)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - I’ve never had the chance nor felt the need to play The Dwarves again for the last three years: thus I can’t be blamed if during my Fall 2015 rating revise I lowered its rating to 4, which better reflects how attractive I find this game.

A simple coop game. The Quests / Tasks are boring simple like "meet here with another player" or "make a skill check with dice".
The only interessting thing is the movment of the faceless enemy. There is a feeling of a flood is going on.

I love the novel "Die Zwerge". The first play of the preview at RPC 2012, was to easy to win, maybe we were to lucky. There are diffenrent levels of difficulty, but I am not able to say if they will scale fine. There is potential in this game, let's see...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Base game alone - average "5" / "6" with expansion
Not a bad game per se, but doesn't bring anything new to the table and it's annoying that the adventures go the wayside so quickly that you don't feel like you're doing anything important, this is somewhat "fixed" by the New Saga expansions where the adventures and quests are combined and you HAD to complete them in order to proceed forward.

At first, I rather liked how the enemies move, but after another 2 games, it became very predictable - I wish there were more movements/intelligence to it. Even when they finally reach Blackrock (sp?) they just sit around and that's that, the penalty is negligible as long as you're not making stupid mistakes. Wish the enemies would just spread out from there as the central base in order to turn more areas into "perished" lands 

The expansions added new decks and mechanics that I wish were implemented into the core game instead as separate "adventures" that you can't officially combine together. Things like building walls or catapults to stem the encroaching horde is quite thematic and fun, the separate disaster (not sure right term?) goes nicely with the combined adventure/quest deck - these quests stay until you complete them, and now you have to complete them all in order to move forward.

All in all, not a bad game, just rather average. It's a good little gateway co-op, but for those that aren't familiar with the books, it loses some of its appeal. Sad that the game isn't that fun with repeated playthroughs.

A cooperative in which you play dwarves who fend of hordes of Elves, Trolls and Orcs. The game is very thematic and has gorgeous artwork. The rules are simple and the game plays pretty fast.

Ok, family style co-op game. Simple and quick.
The "perished lands" mechanism is interesting, but it's the only thing in the game that stands out. The rest of the theme and mechanisms are fairly bland and uninteresting.
The game is more about reacting to the current board state than it is about planning ahead.

Great game so far, although the limit of two actions each turn can kind of make it feel like you're never really doing all that much playing. Still, each game has been pretty down to the wire and the inclusion of the Saga Expansion to introduce different scenarios keeps things fresh. It would be nice if the equipment deck wasn't so limited.

It's not the best or most difficult coop game in the world but solid with some quite good ideas. Unfortunately I haven't read the books and since the theme of the game hasn't raised my interest in doing so, I have to guess that this means that the game is not thematic enough for my taste. I didn't get hooked on it.

RATING: 8.5
After 5 plays with 3 players and no loss it seems to be too easy for a cooperative boardgame (played all 5 normal difficulties 1 time each, but have not used the rule with 4 instead of 5 enemies causing deadland yet). Nevertheless I enjoyed all sessions, so I certainly will try the even harder mode for a greater challenge.
Second problem is the low number of scenario-cards. Already ordered the expansion, which will hopefully fix that issue.

Compared to it's direct contendor "Legends of Andor" (Fantasy Coop from Essen 2012), this one loses in every single category. The game works fine, but it doesn't feel like fantasy or adventuring at all. Feels a little bit like "Defenders of the Realm - super light".

Full 4-player game. I love how the perished land tiles are introduced into the game and sometimes cause chain reactions. Ultimately, it's a less interesting co-op game than I was hoping for. The Saga expansion introduces new things though so hopefully I can try it out soon and see the full potential of this game.

I fear that it doesn't even come close to the Legends of Andor though.

2 Plays - Kickstarter Edition, 2015. All the fun of this game disappeared before even opening the packaging due to this being the worst kickstarter I've ever been involved in. 

After finally getting it I had promoised myself not to open it, but did anyway, feeling like I should forgive and forget everything that had happenned. 

This is a gateway (plus) type game, but is terrible at achieving its purpose. It relies on a number of cards in a dispaly, that have lots of text on them (which corresspond with hard to spot areas on the map). They are constantly being replaced, making them annoying to 'keep up with'. A large number of them also, often hold no impact on the game/ players options anyway.

The upgraded meeples are so big (and fiddly) for the hexes that I almost revereted back to the cubes.

The different miniature sizes are rediculous, with the smaller ones being smaller than some of the meeples. 

The dice rolling was highly luck based with results being hard to mitigate with any form of planning.

In our plays, many of the completed adventures we worked hard to complete ended up being discarded due to game effects - totally ruining the feeling of 'building up an engine' or any sort desire to work toward long-term planning. Similar things happenned to our equipment, making us wonder why we had tried to obtain them in the first place. 

Terribe game, terrible service, terrible price paid for experience - and now - terrible resell value.

Worst Kickstarter campaign for me so far:
"Exclusive" wooden box - it is total crappy, cheap box out of cheap wood, no segmentaion, no inlay. The new detailed dwarves are looking very good - BUT
they are in a totally different scale than the miniatures from the base game. Looks bad and silly, too.
Very, very awful Kickstarter experience. No communication, no help and no fair solution after all the errors and disappointing wooden box. Never buy anything of Pegasus any more! Be warned - do not back them on future campaigns!
Edit:
Now they communicate and try to fix the problems so changed my rating to 5.

Too long. The early quests can take a very long time (for example, if you need tasks that provide items, but all you get is healing). The final quest was very easy in comparision (2 plays, two different final quests). Rulebook could be a lot clearer.

Rating further reduced after more plays. It's purely random. In one game, we won about halfway through the time track. In antoher game, we just finished the first minor quest then, because the monster rolls just didn't match to what we needed. Winning or losing the game is just too random. 
Many sources of healing, but very rarely do you get damage. 

It's tempting to do the minor quests (adventures?) when you can't do anything for the big quest. But finishing minor quests early is bad for you, since it increases the chances that bad things come out later. Bad mechanic.

Oh, and not to forget the major complaint: Quite boring.

RATING: 6
The theme of this game is great. It's fun to be a dwarf! The mechanism for advancing the enemies is also novel and interesting. However, the setup is complex and time-consuming with a bunch of different decks of cards to juggle, and I wish it didn't rely so much on roll-to-resolve.

RATING: N/A
Light, fantasy coop adventure board game that plays like a cross between Defenders of the Realm and Pandemic.  Its a race to complete a stack of quests before the countdown timer intesects with the evil threat level--brilliant. The quests are usually dice based with some foul and nasty events thrown in to disrupt heroes' progress. I love the mechanic that manages how the hordes spread towards the Capital City leave a wake of perished lands. Heroes are forced to choose between fighting back overruns of orc, trolls, and dark elves, OR lobbying the council for increased favor, OR taking a minor quest for better gear ... while time slips by. Luck of the dice looms large over your success. We don't mind that. This easily replaces our DotR. I wonder about replay life and it doesn't seem challenging enough is my only concerns.

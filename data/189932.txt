I wanted to like this, but a few issues:

1. The components leave something to be desired, the minis are all super tiny and look cheap, the card backs are ugly and the art is kinda meh. Superficial but still.

2. There are not that many cards that trash out of your deck, and you are at the whim of the ascension style large stack that fills a market row. As with that other game, you can get screwed via card flipping. In ascension the game is over quickly enough that it is't that big of a deal. here you play until the entire deck is gone (or someone gets all their pieces out, both will take a while).

I think it's an interesting take on the dominion-on-a-map style game, but I think someone still can do this system much better.

RATING: 7
A deckbuilder with a board on which players try to control areas.  With a full complement of four players, the board gets crowded quickly and there is plenty of conflict.  On top of expanding your empire by placing troops and building your deck, there are spies who reduce the benefits to opponents of controlling the largest areas and allow soldiers to be parachuted in.  It's all driven by the cards, so the extent to which you focus on each of these is up to you.  Mechanically it is all pretty straightforward and familiar stuff, which does at least keep the rules explanation short.  Conflicts tend to be attritional, multi-turn affairs.  There are rewards for killing opposing units, but avoiding it where possible tends to be more efficient.  My one concern is with the low number of cards that allow promotion (trashing to thin your deck and earn victory points).  It seems to me that a player who is unable to gain one of these is at a substantial disadvantage.  Despite this criticism, I have had a fun time with Tyrants.

Production quality is good.  Overall, the artwork is pretty dreadful.  While the board is entirely functional, it offers no impression of the territory we are battling over.  The box art is also bland and boring.  The cards are slightly better.

I liked this a lot, and that means a lot because there is a major production drag. Don't like the art, don't like the usability, boring and hard-to-read board, comical cardstock differences between the base game and the expansion, etc. And I'm not big on Dominion clones. Just really liked the approach on this one, with the simpler whole-deck setup and a lot of real action on the board. Unlike, say, Trains. Outside of production, which is a huge knock, I'd knock the variance in the cards. Lots of times we found ourselves wanting to be able to buy power cards, and they were just never there.

I have a few minor gripes over Tyrants, namely the plastic pieces feel a little small, the design of the board and card backs are a little bland, and I wish there were some more asymmetrical feel to the various Houses. That being said, it is still an excellent blend of deck building and area control which is intuitive, clever, and thematically manages to draw out the IP in a way Gale Force 9 titles always seem to. Whether or not the Lords of Waterdeep crowd will pick up on this is yet to be seen, but it was well worth the wait and I look forward to myriad plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Commits a number of deck building cardinal sins; multiple currencies, market row, powerful cards worth large values of points. It does have some clever mitigation aspects - currency 2 is spent on area control/battles. Trashing cards is an important strategy. High repetition of cards. Means that you can target a strategy and pursue it. It wasn't terrible - whilst it commits many of the sins that Ascension does, its solutions work somewhat. An acceptable, if unremarkable game.

Production quality is unforgivable given how much this tends to sell for.

RATING: 6
Very playable deck-builder with a theme that's more pasted on than Lords of Waterdeep. GF9 managed to fit deck-building, area control, and other nefarious subterfuge into a game that can be easily taught and, more importantly, maintains a fast pace to each round. The variable market decks add a sufficient amount of replayability. This is a solid, but fairly light, design.

Tyrants seems best suited for a casual/mixed experience play session where everyone isn't taking it too seriously. However, you can have a run-away leader if the other players don't keep the leader heavily in check, so it's kind of straddling both casual and competitive worlds. The promotion cards seem really strong and cutting those off from your opponent can doubly benefit you. Further, in view of the promote cards' strength, the luck of purchasing appears to be a bit more influential than some of the more competitive deck builders.

Wow.  I was expecting to like this game but not this much.  Takes some of the best aspects of deck builders and adds a purpose to building those decks.

RATING: 8.1
Super fun and a great surprise! I wasn't expecting too much from this. I saw it on the "Hot Games" table at Dice Tower Con and wanted to play it but never got the chance. Picked it up on a whim. I really like this game! It is particularly nasty, even more so than I thought. It is super easy to kill off the other players troops and to get spies out to stop the VP generating areas. I also really enjoy the deck thinning, which is done by certain cards only and increases the VP value of the cards that you remove from the deck. Should I take that awesome Dragon out of my deck now, it's 8 VP? But again, be warned as this can really turn mean quickly. Flo loves deck building games but I don't think she will play this because of the potential meanness. Can't wait for the expansion decks!

Really fun game, the way the content is handled was well designed, can't wait to play it more.

update: this game is a blast, love the drow content and the way they handle the backstabbing/treachery in this game.  The best part of this game is you can change your strategy and not feel like the game is over, for example I thought i was going to win no challenge because I was promoting cards like crazy, but my friend almost beat me (I won by 2 points) because at the last minute he placed spies on all my total control spots and he had more cards overall then me.  Overall, recommend this game, it's a lot of fun

An euro in disguise (which ironically makes it a little more thematic), Tyrants of the Underdark is an area control game set in the eponymous Forgotten Realms underground region: this means that playing it at least once is mandatory for any self-respecting roleplayer.

I don’t usually like either area control games or deck builders and my fondest RPG memories date back to the glorious days of AD&D, when the Drow simply were evil guys you heard about but stood away from, not the fanboys’ wet dream they’ve become now: anyhow, I found Tyrants mildly entertaining, mostly thanks to its mechanisms that blend perfectly with the theme. 

As usual with this kind of games, heavily planning ahead is the only way to be competitive to some extent.

Interesting mix of deck building + area control.  Definitely steals lots from other games, but the idea of promoting a card was interesting.  Also the "power" in the game which is used to mess with the board worked well.  Not sure I love the game, but it was definitely fun, and am looking forward to exploring it more.  The theme doesn't do much for me, but it does seem to fit this game well.

This was a fun combination of deck building and area control on the map. The mechanics all feel familiar, but the combination plays well and the "king of the hill" mechanics are fun. I find the board look and placing of troops a little bland/generic, but the card powers are cool and the idea of promoting cards to cull your deck and earn more VPs is fun. The spies are a nasty addition to add some sabotage. The game didn't blow me away, but i enjoyed it and thought it was a good time.

Provisional rating, only played it twice.

A streamlined hybrid deckbuilder/area control game, with a fairly thin fantasy theme.
Nothing stunningly new here, but game play is smooth and a lot of fun.

It's a bit 'take that' and you can't turtle (spies are great - super way to get round people who insist in blocking off areas). Definitely a learning curve, both what cards are available and how to play them.

Can see expansions (I hope) with new half decks to add more variety :)

Ascension-style deck-building with area control.

Tyrants of the Underdark, just like Clank! (both published in 2016), is a hybrid deck-bulding and area control game. What makes TotU more interesting than Clank! to me is the extremelly important deck-thinning mechanism. You want to buy the best cards for your deck, but at the same time you need to trash those cards at the right time to obtain the most points at the end of the game.

Rules and card text are fairly straightforward, so new players can be up and running in no time. Gameplay is kept fresh by the interaction among players and the multiple viable strategies. I always have fun playing this game.

**********************************
(November 2017) There is an expansion with two additional decks. I am tempted to add it to my next order if I find a cheap copy.

This was the game I was most excited for at Origins and I wasn't disappointed. It feels like they took the idea of Trains to make a more aggressive game. I've played this just once with the suggested half decks. I look forward to mixing and matching the combinations to see how else it can play out.

After a few additional plays, I still really like this game. The game has such basic concepts, but when mashed together, they work really well. I do hope that GF9 makes additional half decks to keep the game interesting.

Tyrants of the Underdark is another game that I've had in my collection for some time but was a long time getting it to the table. This may have been a mistake... It's a solid game in its own right, but for me it fills the same niche as Clank! but I'd much rather play Clank!. 

I do not recommend this game with an odd number of players as it sucks to be the player stuck in the middle. I wouldn't be against playing this one again, but I'll probably just play Clank! instead.

My favorite game in the deck-building genre.  Mechanics around the deck are anchored by the board play, meaning you get the best expression of a purpose around collecting the cards. I have a love affair with this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
It's smooth and kind of gets out of the way letting the familiar deckbuilding mechanisms combine with board play for a very easy and simple game with interaction. It has enough screwage and conflict to provide for a dynamic situation and overcomes its sort of bland mechanical base.

The several paths to VP/victory is real and there is some depth here. I can see this being a commercial hit as it's the type of game you can grab off the shelf and it will succeed with a wide range. However, it is very expensive relative to its peers.

Tyrants of the Underdark... 是一隻D&D 的 DBG。喜歡兩者的朋友都應早知道它的存在，它主要是利用 deck build 機制利用地形互相爭奪地區拿獎品和分數 (視乎 control / total control).  玩法像 Trains 但主題氣氛和機制似乎格格不入。畫功了得是科幻派的D&D。其中一招promoto 用來消卡和可放置spies 令DB 玩家感覺爽快流畅和激死其他對手外，其他卡牌功能比較普通和沒有獨特之處。喜歡  D&D 和 DBG 的玩家可以留意。個人就覺得此 遊戲可玩但不急於買。君閣下已有 Dominion, trains 和其他不同類型的 DBG, 這隻遲早會被打入冷宮。

RATING: 9
Turns Ascension-style deckbuilding into something I enjoy much, much more via persistent board-state: what I want to add to my deck depends on the board situation, and what I want to do on the board depends on my deck.

The board play was a lot of fun, but does look to require awareness of table balance, lest the "let's you and them fight" dynamic be too strong - while you do get points for kills, it's probably not enough to compensate for the loss of area-control VPs elsewhere, so back-and-forth battles seem to benefit those not involved.

Really appealing - though overpriced for the component quality? The cards aren't terrible, but neither are they great. I mean, I'd rather have great gamplay with mediocre components than vice versa, but it's still a sour note.

My only mechanical concern is that the randomness of the purchase tableau means a player could just never have the chance to buy certain abilities, including the incredibly important Promote. (Trash, which in this game boosts how much VP a card is worth - though the cards which Promote seem to be costed with that in mind.)

But if that's not a problem, it looks like this could play lightning-fast and generally be awesome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
great area control and conflict game where a deck/pool building mechanism plays a healthy role.  this is not a "deck builder", it's an area control where your actions are limited by what cards you've bought previously in the game.

the only real problem i see with this game is the card market. just like ascension and star realms, it suffers from the issue of revealing better cards for your opponent, after buying what was available to you.

equally good at 2, 3 and 4 players.

Expansion cards are a mess though and don't even feel like game cards.

There is a deck building mechanism, similar to "Trains" (without the "trash" cards) but here there is also great interaction over the board, involving furious competition for area control with other players, as also with a "passive" set up player.
The cards have very nice artwork (but the board has almost none) and are very easy to grasp, that is, they don´t require the reading of a great amount of text in order to understand what powers they allow.
Overall it was a nice experience, even if there is some AP involving some decisions and the game can easily extend for some 3 hrs...

I absolutely love the mechanics.  Just like Dominion, the game play is very slow on the first couple plays because everyone is trying to read the market cards.  

The Market cards continuously changing makes strategy changes required (which I like), but makes it even harder to learn the cards and makes reading market cards required during the entire game.  This leads to too much down time and sometimes leads to you having to change your plans because someone bought the card in the market you were going to get.  Not a major issue in my opinion, but does increase down time.

My major issue with the game is the card and piece quality.  The cards are some of the flimsiest cards I've ever held.  The pieces are also very cheap basic injected plastic pieces (nothing to write home about).  This wouldn't be an issue if this wasn't a $75 msrp game.  I paid $50 for the game which I feel is about as high as I would be willing to go.  Even at that price I feel the quality isn't worth it, but I enjoy the game and mechanics enough to deal with that. 

Overall, one of my new favorite games, but extremely poor, disappointing product quality.

I have enjoyed playing this game every time. Multiple deck types make for a lot of strategy combos. It is normally more expensive than I would pay for a deck builder but I got it at Half Price Books when it was one of their 20% off new retail items with a 50% off 1 item coupon making it ~$30 including tax, a real steal and much closer to what I'd actually pay for this game.

All in all it is a very fun game and well made. I just picked up the expansion for even more play combo options. If you can find it at a price that you are willing to pay, I strongly suggest getting it.

This game is really badly designed. I mean, the production is not low, the cards are thick, the boards and player pieces are of good quality. But the pictures (although nice) on the cards are just too big. They are so big, it is not possible to see what the cards actually do when you don't sit next to the market. In other-than-excellent light, you can't even make out whether it provides webs or swords. And that is just bad. Moreover, you have 4 player colors in the game - red, orange, black and - dark blue. Really? Again, in other than excellent light, you can very easily mistake black and dark blue. And that is, again, just bad.

BUT. The gameplay is very good. The board feels tight at all player counts since it shrinks and expands depending on how many people play. It is fun and cutthroat. It also combines 2 of my favourite mechanisms - area control and deckbuilding - in a very lovely way. The area control is easy but not at all random (which I love). The deckbuilding aspect has the deckcleaning mechanism I love (plus it gives you more points when you do that). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Lots of neat ways to score points. Build up your deck, promote cards out of your deck, make trophies out of opposing troops, and control sites. It all works really well. It's great that they included four different minion decks to be combined for differing game experiences.

I am so pumped. My son and I love this game, but it gets a little stale with 2 players. Enter my daughter. She loves Legendary, and I told her it was similar to it. She picked up on the strategies and mechanics very quickly. Of course, I am the blunt of most of their attacks, but it's all good fun. Because she now plays (and thoroughly enjoys it), I bumped up the rating. The game really starts to shine with more players.

I really enjoy this game.  The mechanics mixing traditional deck-building along with area control works really well.  The card art is amazing.  The rating is for the gameplay alone, though.  The card stock is thin (in first game already they showed wear) and the board art is boring.  But the gameplay is tight and player interaction is well balanced.  This replaces the similar-ish Lords of Waterdeep.  While still a game about Victory Points, LoW and its worker placement mechanic grew tired while the varied decks and sometimes ruthless conflict with opponents makes Tyrants my go-to D&D game right now.

Elég egyértelmű ascension nyúlás, de mivel sikerült jobb játékot csinálni belőle, ezért nem tartom akkora bűnnek. :)
Mondjuk azt, hogy táblás ascension. Jó ötlet a haderő táblás elköltése, míg a pénz vásárlásra használata. Bármilyen kombináció jó lehet így, mindenből ki lehet hozni valamit. A tábla megadja azt az interakciót, ami hiányzik a deckbuilderekből, bár ad némi királycsinálós jelleget is, de csak maximum, akkor ha szélsőségesen valaki ellen lépnek. A játékidő is barátságos. Jó játék, bármikor szívesen játszom vele. Az ára mondjuk elég horror, de ez az rétékelést nem kell, hogy befolyásolja.

I like the theme. This game reminds me of Ascension in that it's pretty much always the best idea to buy the most expensive card. It's too hard to thin your deck to waste time with lesser cards. Unlike Ascension, there's no motivation to specialise in particular types of cards.

The only real choice seems to be to play for card VPs or for map VPs, i.e. do you go for military or influence. Even then I'm not sure if one is better than the other, so I'm left wondering whether any of the choices mean anything at all.

This game is fantastic. Definitely the best "deckbuilder with a board" I've played, high above Clank and Trains and the like.
The cards have cool effects. I always feel like I'm getting something awesome when I buy on my turn. The board play is equally quick and fun.
I usually don't like area control games, but here you can't just immediately steal your opponent's stuff without a lot of investment. So the battle lines tend to be drawn and it feels more like a conquest game than random area control, which I prefer.
I also love the half deck variety. Sure, the basic powers don't change... you're still placing spies, assassinating, etc. But the differences between devouring demons and VP scoring dragons is pretty big.

A mash-up, with nothing really innovative. Theme is weak. High amount of take-that balances out some of the randomness in this deck builder, where many of your points are scored through attacks, or area majorities on a board. Game plays a little long IMO. Also, don't like the downtime that comes from drawing a new card every turn to come out in the display. If you want area control with deck building, I'd go with Trains. However, if you like the take-that interaction, this would be the one.

Excellent melding of deck building, area control and VP gathering. The game can be mean and bashing the leader or alternatively the lager is definitely going to happen - but it is an area control game.

Fantastic deck-building game, the best I've played in some time, since Trains I think. Nice variety in cards, nothing seems terrible, lots of different paths to victory. The only thing that's a constant is you can't leave other players alone, with total control, racking up victory points. You have to challenge them.

Really fun. 
Negotiate to go after the leader, with deck building, and area control.

Con:
Needs more "half-decks".
Some dragons are overpowered. 
Commits the biggest deck-builder sin, poor card quality (is this 2008!?).
Biggest complaint would be if someone has a good hand and buys an expensive card it can be very hard to counter that player, especially if it's early in the game, as with most deck builders the rich get richer.
Rushing end-game by putting out all your tokens is impossible to stop.

RATING: 6
A deck-builder, area-majority game "themed" around the D&D universe of the dark elves, or drows. One, 4-player game with the Drows and Dragons decks. The board is set up to scale for different player counts but 4 players was a bit of a drag; it might be better at 3 or even 2 players.

Overall, it was fine. If I liked deck builders more, this might rate higher. While I wouldn't say no to another play, I'm not going to suggest it again. 

PROS
-Deck building and card powers are relatively straight forward and easy to grasp.
-A lot of potential for expansions to make this game more interesting.

CONS
-While the rules are fairly simple, they are a bit scattered and some aspects of the game (e.g., What does move mean?) were not clear without digging.
-Board art is kind of minimal and the routes look more like a flow-chart than a D&D adventure.
-With the actions being more or less limited to buy a card, deploy a spy, deploy a troop, attack a troop, the game play was kind of boring.

What a pleasant surprise! Man, this game had a great mix of deck building, area control, take that, etc. Of deck builders that use a board, I much prefer this to Clank! I really enjoyed this one and would certainly play it again.

EDIT: After a second play, I still like this a lot, but my rating is falling a bit. The graphic design flaws are beginning to become more noticable, namely the small text on the cards, which are impossible to see from afar. Building card synergies in this game is imperative, so if you can't see the cards or the symbols on them, that's a problem. Still a good game though.

I do not love the "decide which large subdecks to shuffle together" style of variable setup, which I've now seen here, in Unfair, and I think at least one other place. And with our setup (drow and dragons?) and four players, the person who got a few promote cards early ran away with massive points and an efficient deck. Also, while the board/card interplay is pretty cool-- there's enough locations on the board for long-term deck dynamics to show up in a nuanced way rather than a swingy way but little enough space for you to care a lot what other people do-- this is one of those games where everybody mumbles through their turn because you feel the need to announce your actions but you don't want to read other people every card you play. And the names are inane and unmemorable, so you can't just call them out Dominion style ("Rats... Rats... Fortress Rats...")

I'd play it again pretty happily, I would just be almost entirely unsurprised if I still didn't enjoy it.

Good deck-builder but with the added tension of area control.  I like the banking mechanic that both thins you deck and scores more points at the end of the game.  Played it only once with 3 people and it was fun.  I'm looking forward to exploring it with 4 to see if the area control aspects are just as good with the full board in play.   The theme is definitely pasted on, but I suppose if you are a fan of Forgotten Realms lore, it would get a slight bump in ratings.   Component quality is ok - the cards are a little too thin for a deck-builder but they are servicable.

RATING: 7
Played a couple times.  First time we played deployment totally wrong for half the game.  Second at STG Con with correct rules.  Overall a good mashup of deck building and old school German area majority.  Deck building rules are basic dominion with a few of the variations that I prefer: random row of cards for sale, can play multiple cards per turn.  The decks seem to expand quickly because of multiple buys as well as Trash cards in certain configurations.  (The art on the trash card comes awfully close to offensive blackface-style bug eyes, imho)

The area majority part works pretty well too.  Pretty much your basic deploy, with occasional moves and replacements.  I like the spies, they add some nice variation and have some fun card effects. Overall, it feels like just a good companion to a deckbuilding engine.

I didn't really care for the art.  As mentioned above, the art veers towards stereotyping people of African descent imo.  I understand this is an issue with drow in general.  I just think WotC needs to reconsider this somehow.  Also the board and the color scheme in general are unappealing to me, and the lack of a map (even a Pandemic-style abstract one) is a big loss to me.

It's much funner than I anticipated but not really close enough to my alley to make the regular rotation.  Will play when my friends want to again though.

This game mixes deck building with an area control game.  At first that doesn't seem like it would work, but in this one it definitely does.

Doesn't bring much new to the table except the "promotion" ability where it makes cards from you deck worth more at the end of the game with the added bonus of taking them out of your deck.

Worst part of this game is the graphic design I think.  I know what they were trying to go for with the purples and blacks, but it doesn't bring much in the way of theme and it definitely adds to the eye sore of this game.  If you can get past that then this is a must try!

RATING: 9
After many plays of TotU, I believe it is one of the best deck builders out there, and has real staying power. Whereas Clank! is great fun, it is definitely more casual fare.


TotU is simple enough to get to grips with in a few rounds of play, but the sneaky use of cards emulate this Drow underworld perfectly.


The colours - yes. It is actually a problem. Player pieces being very, very similar to each other in colour, and the differentiating emblems on the small pieces are hard to discern.


Another small cosmetic irritation is also having to block off flanks of the board with less than 4 players - it would have been nice to receive a modular board, or perhaps a double printed board to avoid this.


Even with these concerns, the game is quickly becoming a go-to in our group, and the rating might go to 10, eventually. Really excited for the first expansion.

Repelling D&D theme, but the mechanics itself is fine.  It seems I like all sorts of deck-building games where cards to purchase are presented on the 'conveyor belt'.

The game feels a bit like 'Clank!', but the race through the maze is replaced here by heavy fighting over locations on the map.

EDIT: I like 2-player mode the least (contrary to Clank!).  It's too agressive then.

EDIT2: OK, two problems cannot be ignored:
- lack of sufficient control (with any number of players)
- limited replayability (and new decks from the expansion don't remedy the situation)

Sold.

Area control deck building game set in the DnD underdark universe. Take control of a drow house and try to stake your claim.

The deckbuilding aspect is quite interesting and almost feels like what Trains did (but with a more appealing theme to most). Fighting for control of cities is great as you get more resources to use on your turn if you control them and if you completely control them you get victory points every turn. Spies provide a wrench you can throw into your opponents cogs as they can be a nuisance since removing them doesn't provide points and their presence can give your opponent avenues to attack or just deny your total control.

The board and components are relatively plain but that seems okay as the theme is not that heavy although some cards are quite thematic in what they do. The cards themselves are a bit flimsy and I would recommend sleeving them as they tend to show wear quite quickly.

I've been really fed up with deckbuilders as they seem to grow increasingly complex and give the player less and less control over the game. tyrants of the underdark has gone the opposite way. the game keeps it simple by sticking to the 2 resource system, while enhancing this with game turn actions that one resource fuels. dead draws are minimal in this game and removing cards from your deck actually advances the game, using a mechanic called 'promotion'. 

This game addresses a lot of issues existing with deck builders while implementing a board control mechanic that actually works with the game, instead of against it in something like Clank!.

RATING: 7
Lords of Waterdeep is the D&D worker placement/contract fulfillment game. Tyrants of the Underdark is the D&D deck-building/area control game. While I don't think Tyrants succeeds quite as well thematically, it balances the two primary design elements really well and has more going on under the hood than may at first appear. The deck-building mechanics (with a an evolving card market) are very familiar, as is the area control aspect. How they interact provides quite a bit of subtle opportunity. 

The game comes with 4 half-decks from which the market is constructed. This is a crafty way of providing variety game-to-game by mixing and matching half-decks and makes expansions even more impactful as you try out different combos. The cards provide two forms of currency - influence to purchase cards and power to move and manipulate your forces on the board. The board is a bunch of linked areas that score points at game's end and in some cases during the game for having control. In addition to troops, players have spies they can use to spread control more quickly, disrupt control in areas they cannot otherwise reach, or to activate powerful special actions on cards. Every card you purchase provides points as well and a key mechanic in the game is to promote cards out of your deck to a score pile, which increases the value of every card that gets promoted. So even streamlining your deck will net you points. Players also gain points for assassinating or supplanting neutral or enemy troops. So between controlling areas, gaining and promoting cards and eliminating troops, there are quite a few focus-points to choose from. Some key actions are only available if you purchase the cards to perform them, so like any good deck-builder, your buying strategy is just as key as your board strategy. This creates a balance of strategic options that feels pretty unique and engaging.

Thematically, the players are all competing factions of the evil drow elf race and the setting is essentially a network of underground passageways and undercities. I like the unusual focus of making everyone evil, but the board layout - while clear - is very utilitarian and doesn't carry the theme the way the cards do. There does seem to be a bit to explore with this game and I hope it continues to be strongly supported by the publisher. The fact that their first expansion did not even bother to match the base game cards that are supposed to be shuffled together is not a good sign for the publisher supporting this title to its full potential...

Combines deck building with territory control and conflict. As far as the deck building goes I feel it's one of the best. The cards you can buy seem very balanced and intelligently designed. When I compare this game to another deck builder, which is very similar: Clank. I think this one comes out on top. A smarter more strategic version of the same kind of game. 
The territory control is flawless. One slight ding is I feel their should be a few more promotions cards in the deck. BTW the ability to promote cards-- brilliant idea. 
Just an awesome, awesome, fun game.

For an area control game, it appeared too easy to infiltrate behind enemy lines - position didn't seem too matter they way one might have hoped.  There are some incredibly devastating card combos and thanks to the way the river works, there can be no opportunity to stop the opponent from acquiring them.  Graphics are also irritating, with cards that area difficult to perceive from across the table.  No real affection for this one.

Dropping this down from 8.5 to 7.5 because I no longer consider this a 4 player game.  The dark blue and dark gray factions are so similar it's almost impossible to play with both.  Even the players playing those factions could barely keep track of which pieces belong to who.

Will consider painting one faction's pieces, but this is basically an inexcusable mistake from a company this big.

[2016.Jul.27] This is an interesting take on [i]Star Realms[/i] and its deck-building kin. The area control aspect adds to the game--not detracts from it--and is properly constrained for 2-, 3-, & 4-players. The overall art design seems a bit simple (aka. rushed-to-production) for such a strongly themed property (D&D).

Gran juego de construcción de mazos. Clásico en su mecánica básica, pero la interacción en el tablero lo hace único.

Great mix of deck/building and area control. I'd rate it higher, but the "luck factor" (that in every deck building is present) here is bigger and forces a bit the strategy, as the choice of cards from the market is limited.

I'm not into D&D and the components/artwork are serviceable.  Gameplay is great!  That's really all that matters to me.  

If you were craving player interaction in your deck builder, this has that in spades.  You can devour cards before your opponent can buy them.  You can bring in spies to negate their total control in locations.  You can assassinate their troops.  The whole game you'll be finding ways to knock your opponent back while carving out your own little area to dominate.

There is some luck introduced with the market for cards.  However, keep in mind, a lot of this game is played on the board and it's not quite as much in how you build your deck.  This isn't Dominion where you're trying to craft a deck with great synergy.  Tyrants is more in how you play the cards you've drawn.  Board position is extremely crucial.  You can't let someone sit back with Total Control of areas, especially ones that provide VP every turn.

Easily replaced Trains.  In Trains, the routes you were building never felt that important and the gameplay just wasn't 'tight' enough.

I do like this game — it's a clever mix of Dominion-style hand management combined with a boardgame of area-control and domination which works really well in my opinion. What's more, I was quite convinced I'd won the game (for the first time ever), until it came down to actually tallying up the scores at the end... And would you darn well believe it, I lost out by just 2 points... :-D

I was intrigued by the area majority concept mixed with deck building but this is just ascension basically, a deckbuilder where you have 2 resources, 1 that improves your deck mostly (influence) and another that mostly scores points. Everything here was done before, very obvious what to do most of the time and the area majority aspect is too shallow.

Compulsive, addictive fun in a box. I've always thought that deckbuilding was a great mechanic, but it needs other things married to it to make a great game, and this one does that. Deckbuilding meets area majority knifefights in a simple and fun way - it's no surprise that the designers of Lords of Waterdeep have produced another easy, delightful, game. 

Different deck builds can produce radically different on the board experiences - I've played to crush the other players on the board; I've played to desperately stave off the other players while trying to promote my whole deck; I've tried to go heavy on messing with my opponents via insane outcasts and spies; I've tried to wall off my area and focus on just buying the best point cards, etc., etc., and all these strategies are fun and viable.

Two issues people may have:

1) If you don't like random market Ascension style deckbuilding, you probably won't like this. Yes, there is quite a bit of luck in what cards you see and this can swing the game.

2) $75 MSRP is a lot for what amounts to bland graphic design and average components. While the game is functional and clear, the card art is the only nice looking thing about the game, which is kind of sad for a game this expensive.

Otherwise though, a really fun game, and one that plays equally well at 2, 3, and 4.

Given my loathing of Lords of Waterdeep, I was skeptical about this one, but it turns out to be a very solid deck-builder / area-control game. The board, art and flavour text are terribly bland (seriously, no-one could be bothered to draw a real map rather than just providing arbitrary spots for pieces?? it's so sketchy it looks like a prototype rather than a real board), but the pointy little shield-meeples are darn cute.

RATING: 5
If Trains is Dominion with a board, Tyrants of the Underdark is Ascension with a board. The difference here is, in what ends up being the opposite of Trains, the board play is much more important than the card play. While the card play here is certainly interesting, the board play is just dull, which is unfortunately where most points come from. A lot of the game comes down to removing enemy troops and putting yours down, which isn't that spectacular. Occasionally you can supplant them, which is a cool mechanism, but this happens very rarely. I really like the mechanism of promoting cards, but otherwise this is a fairly unremarkable and disappointing game.

RATING: N/A
Great concept, but I wish they went a bit further with it.

Deck-building could use some more interesting effects. Right now all the cards are very similar in what you can do. 99% of them are limited to: money, remove a card from your deck, (re)move a unit, place a unit, place a spy. Same goes for the area control side of things - I wish those locations had some abilities apart from +1 copper.

It feels like the game tends to overstay its welcome a little bit. Though I`m not sure if there's a way to fix it.

-1 star for production. Everything is shades of purple, tiny icons and text on the cards. Odd choice of player colors. Black is easy to confuse with dark blue, the same with orange and red.

Good platform for deck building. Felt it was missing something. I think it will be crucial to add an expansion with new half decks and each half deck with its own set of miniatures that may represent maybe threats common to all players or perhaps troops with twice the power or migrating troops.... The game has a lot of potential for expansions. Not to mention the possibility of new maps! Can't wait to see what they add. As it stands I gave it a 6.

[b]Tyrants of the Underdark[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]This ended up being one of my favorite plays from TotalCon. It was on my radar for a while, but by the time it came out I wasn't sure that deck building + area control would be a combination of mechanics I'd like. Also pictures don't do this game justice, itlooks much better in person. The art on the cards is great and the relatively sparse board actually works well with the game play. The board ends up being covered with minis so it is easy to count up majorities in each region, especially since each area is clearly marked.

As far as game play is concerned, Tyrants knocks it out of the park. I love area control games, deck building not so much, but the combination works surprisingly well. The card play dovetails nicely with the actions you would normally take in an area control game. Tyrants adds two types of units you can place on the board which has a lot of different implications during the game. Soldiers need to be placed contiguous to one another, but you can place spies outside of any region. Once a spy is in place, soldiers can now be placed in that region without worrying about the usual placement rules. This really opens the game up since no area is ever truly safe. 

One component of the deck building I really thought was clever is that each card will score points at the end, but you can "promote" [i](remove from the game)[/i] a card to your inner circle and it will score more points. This sets up an interesting dynamic as you try and time when you should start promoting cards from your deck because the more points a card is worth the better the powers it'll have. 

There is a lot more going on with the game play, but suffice it to say that everything works seamlessly and there is a lot of depth to explore. Each game you choose two of four decks to play with so there is still a lot more to explore in the game. Tyrants is an in your face, aggressive game, it is area control at it's nastiest. 

I'm excited to see designers explore different ways to combine mechanics with area control. Guilds of London and Lotus are great examples of this and hopefully there will be more to come. On the flip side I'm not usually a fan of deck builders, but when it isn't the whole game I've found some games I really like such as Clank and Super Motherload.

Tyrants exceeded all my expectations and I'm looking forward to playing with my kids, I even think my son will enjoy it in large part due to the theme, even though he normally isn't a fan of area control games.[/i]

Tyrants of the Underdark is a deck-building game that fuels a territory control game on the game board. You can use money on cards to buy better cards (available in a random replenishing display), and military points to add soldiers to the board to remove neutral or opponent's soldiers. There are also a number of ways to get in-game points, either by using certain cards or controlling cities on the board. Cards in your deck are generally worth points at the end of the game too. There is also a deck-thinning mechanic called "promote" which lets you remove a card from your deck and increases the end-game point value--you want to use this early to get rid of bad starter cards, but also late to convert good cards for big points. On the whole, there was nothing wrong with the game, but as an experience it felt a bit bland to me. The graphic design felt dated, and I just didn't feel like I was doing anything that I hadn't done in lots of deck-builders before.

An excellent combination of deck building and area control, but with distractingly bad presentation.

I really like the combination of deck building and area control, where you can't ignore either part of the game and they work together surprisingly well. The deck building is very similar to the Legendary games and the area control is pretty straightforward by itself, but the combination creates a lot of interesting decisions. You can craft your deck with more purchasing power to get great cards with useful effects, or specialize in "promoting" cards to thin your deck for points, or specialize in attack power so you can dominate the board more quickly, etc. There are multiple ways to earn points, with different deck and board strategies to emphasize each one. The points are difficult enough to fully track that you can't tell exactly who's in the lead, so you don't get the tedious bash-the-leader effect that's common at the end of area control games, as people try to not let the game end until they are in the lead.

Unfortunately, the production quality of the game is very poor, especially considering the high asking price. The graphic design on the board is functional, but completely lacks visual appeal. It looks like something an intern would come up with for a prototype before any of the art assets have been created for the game. This is made worse by the absurdly narrow color palette, dominated by purples, dark blues, and dark grays. The player pieces can be difficult to differentiate at times because the colors are so similar, and there are only four player colors! The art on the cards is nice, but the graphic design overall is amateurish at best.

Overall, I really like the design. It's the best implementation of deck-building that I've played by a pretty large margin. I do wish the publisher had done a more competent job with the visual design, and I'm afraid the game won't get the attention it deserves because of it.

Clever marriage of deck-building and area control. The system is straightforward, while offering good variability in the approaches to deck-building. The board-play develops nicely, with the early spreading out in the Underdark eventually getting tighter and more aggressive as the sites are occupied. Plays fairly quickly, at 60-90 minutes. 

I do have some concerns with runaway leaders, as deck synergies and inefficiencies can ramp up rapidly. In particular, using promotion to thin a deck and increase VPs seems very powerful. The board-play should enable players to corral and slow down a leader, but I'm not sure it can make up for the power of a strong deck. 

Also, the art design is flat-out poor. I cannot fathom why they chose blood-orange, red, deep indigo, and dark grey as the four player colours. The icons and numbers on the cards are annoyingly small when perusing the market. The components in general have a cheap look and feel, though the artwork on the cards is nice. 

Rating could improve if I see more dynamic gameplay and reversals of fortune.

update:  I enjoy this less each time I play it.  The card draft is random, card draws are random, the game drags long past when an obvious winner emerges, and decks are bloat-prone.  I like the core mechanics, but the end result does not quite deliver.

It is not a fun game to lose, and most players will lose.

old comment:
This game is a superb and well balanced mix of already solid mechanics.  Every turn offers both tactically and strategically interesting choices.  The them is also great but I'm not someone who is sold on the theme -- the game would be superb even if were entirely abstract.  Also, it plays quickly and still produces has a satisfying a arc.

However, issues can arise.
(1) Sometimes one player will get a luck break on turn 1 or 2, and the game will snowball and not be much fun.
(2) There is an immense last turn advantage, which is only masked by issue #1.  Defense of this issue from the designer & fans usually amounts to admitting that #1 is such a sever issue that you won't notice #2.
(3) There is also often a long period where it is clear who has won, and yet the game does not end.

I suspect these issues can all be addressed and restore my original enthusiasm with a few house rules, based on a misunderstand I had of setup rules on my first few plays.
(a) during setup, go around filling all the black locations, not just one per player.
(b) each turn, you can devour one starting card that you played that turn

For me, this game is almost perfect. It's so close to being a 10, but the components let it down. The different card stock, poor inlay and oversized box mean this stays at a 9.0. 

Gameplay wise, it shines at 2,3 or 4 players. It doesn't do anything new or amazingly different, it just takes existing mechanics and does it very well indeed. I've taken it to game night three times now and ended up playing it all night with different people all evening.

I am normally ok with deck building games that use the random buy row mechanic, but the times I've played this game so far I've found it to be very detrimental to my enjoyment of the game. Getting screwed out of cards that allow you to do much needed actions like promote, devour, or place a spy, can easily ruin the entire experience for you. Also, in each game I've played, someone had snowballed their way to victory and nothing is worse than knowing you have no hope of changing the tides (even if you "ally" with another losing player) long before the game is over. 

In other random buy row games, I end a game at least always feeling that I did the best I could with what I had available to me, even if I scored poorly. But here in Tyrants I constantly felt like I was being held back by the marketplace. It was a bottleneck that I could not work around and even if I could buy high cost cards, I could not buy enough of them to make up for getting hosed on the availability of promote cards on my turn and thus compete against those who were able to put good cards in their inner circle.

I feel the starter deck should have at least one card that gives you the option to promote/devour/place a spy. At the very least, if you end up having bad luck getting those cards from the market row, you will still be able to still do those actions once in a great while.

A surprisingly decent deck builder that manages to combine deck building, conflict and area control very successfully. Nothing original here, and the Underdddrrzzzaaark theme does nothing for me personally, but deck-building plus conflict is a field with a very low success rate in my experience, making this worth a second look, or picking up when it inevitably hits clearance.

Tyrants of the Underdark is a fun deck building game.

The graphic design is terrible, and the card distribution I played with had some problems. I like the idea of using spies to give players strategic reach, and simultaneously setup strong turns by sacrificing the strength of earlier turns, but having too many cards that place a spy or remove a spy for a reasonably big payout make the game feel stilted, and aren't as exciting as other effects.

Great game right out of the box.  Would give it a ten but minor production details inhibit total experience (mainly poor contrast between black/gray and dark blue pieces and the storage aspects relating to card separation is lacking).

We have submitted a minor rule variant that allows use of all decks simultaneously which has worked great every time we have played it so far.

Well, this has pretty much ensured that Ascension won't be making the table any time soon.  It basically does what Ascension does in a more streamlined manner.  Love the promoting to the Inner Circle mechanic.  The card interplay is also quite good.  It's a solid 8 with room to improve.

I'm not a fan of games built purely around deck-building as engine-building.  But games that use deck-building for some larger purpose interest me.  Tyrants does this very successfully.  The ruleset is sparse, elegant, and eminently understandable (consider the lack of rules-questions here on BGG).  The map control element is strategic, dynamic, and filled with tension till the last turn.  The various decks/types of cards provide a fair bit of variety from game to game.  The theme works for me and my game-group because we all have a fondness for old-school D&D settings, characters, and art.  I've played this 4-player (excellent) and 2-player (surprisingly good).  Yet again, the WOTC designers surprise me with an elegant and engaging design.  This is a current favorite for me and my group, and I am definitely keeping it in my collection for the foreseeable future.

The one caveat I'll throw out is that I don't think it's playable in 60 min.  With 4 players, you're easily talking 2 hours - and my group usually takes 2.5.

Interesting mixture of deck building and area control. Unfortunately I thought the area control part of the game is rather boring. There isn't a lot of strategies when coming to where/how to expand your base as there are many ways to move figures or spawn in enemy territories. It plays fairly quickly so thats a plus, but not somethign I would ask to bust out to play.

Suffered from a massive engine failure on my first go of this and spent the whole game fighting the same battle over and again in one corner of the board. EDIT. Played again and had a much better showing. Interestingly, the same Vietnam dynamic happened again but for different players. Will be interesting seeing how our tactics develop as we learn more about the game.

Deck-building with area majority board play. The board has a bunch of locations, each with space for a variable number of soldiers, connected by paths (consisting of different numbers of spaces, also for soldiers). The game starts with a bunch of neutral soldiers spread throughout. Players seed the board with their own starting soldiers as well. Everyone's deck has cards to allow placing or moving more pieces, killing soldiers, etc. Also, currency with which to buy more cards (in an Ascension-like display) and/or VP tokens. Taking majority control of several regions gives you additional income each turn. 

Turns are pretty typical: use your cards to do stuff, discard the rest, replenish your hand. When the game ends, score VP for controlling areas. Uniquely, you also score VP for all the cards in your deck (though they're worth more if you manage to entomb them -- or whatever the term is in this game). Most VP wins!

Pretty fun game, more interesting than straight-up deck builders, and apparently with a good amount of variability built in (several half-decks are included in the game, and you only play with 2 each game). Maybe a bit too simple, though (i.e., lacking the depth of deck-builders-in-a-game games like A Few Acres of Snow)?åç

Interesting combination of deck builder with area control. I tend to not like area control games, but when mixed with the deck builder aspect it wasn't that bad. I liked the mechanic of promoting cards as the card would be removed from your deck and worth more VPs at the end of the game. This created an interesting trade off as more powerful cards gave more VPs, but you wanted them in your deck for the special abilities. 

The artwork/components were very bland and I am indifferent to the DnD theme.

A deck-builder mixed with a simple area control game. Unlike most deck builders, there's a lot of interaction here, so I like it better. The two halves of the game are perhaps not as well integrated as they could be, though - the board state has very little impact on the decks.

RATING: 7
Deckbuilding + a board is a trend I like to see, however, I'm noticing more and more that designers are using it as a crutch to make the deck building weak. The deck building and the area control feel like two different games being played at the same time. The deckbuilding is really no better or worse than games like DC Deckbuilder, but there were interesting choices to make on the board.

RATING: 5
I'm not a huge fan of open draft, Ascension-style deckbuilding.  I find it incredibly frustrating when the tableau consistently has the right cards for some players, but others are constantly staring at mediocre offerings.  That certainly happens in this game, and add to it that the card balance seems to be of a fairly wide range. 

The board play is okay, but it has the typical dudes on a map thing of the player who fights least will often win.  The components are not very impressive, and the board is ugly.  It is also probably too long for what it is.  Out of the 2016 open draft deckbuilders, Clank! is a much better choice.

I really enjoyed this.  It did area control combined with Deckbuilding very well.  Everything was simple and made sense.  Using the DnD universe makes the monsters and (potential) expansion cards are virtually limitless.  Would very much love to play again, and hopefully will soon.  I also liked that you can cull cards for points.  Not sure that the cards needed points just for purchasing them, but the cull was a good mechanism.  Allows for transition to the mid and end game more successful.

The deck building and area control work well together. Nice mix of card abilities. Very confrontational. I like how you mix two decks together to form the market; solves the problem single-deck deckbuilders have of getting too big.
Components are not so hot; cards are poor quality, tokens don't look very nice.

RATING: 9
This is a deck building game with area control themed to the Dungeons & Dragons Underdark setting.  Each player is a member of a house in the Drow society and are trying to control as much of the Underdark region as possible.  You gain victory points for cards in your deck, cards you promote to your inner circle (removed from the game, but worth more points now), enemy units that you defeated and areas on the board that you control.  The game comes with a board where you place your troop units to gain control of various areas of the board.

The deck building and area control aspects of this game mesh very well.  You have to strike a good enough balance between the two.  I also really like the fact that this game has a lot of direct player interaction.  You are competing directly with the other players for control of areas.  You will be directly attacking the other players' troops.  Certain cards allow to directly attack another player's deck.  I am generally a fan of the deck building mechanic, but many deck builders tend to lack direct player interaction.  This game has that deck building mechanic and allow you to directly lay a smacking to (or take one from) another player.  As of now (2016) this is my favourite deck building game.

This has deckbuilding (which I love) and area control (which I love) in a fantasy setting (which I love). Although I am not into D&D, this seems like a game that's right up my alley. I rate this slightly lower than Clank! because Clank is more accessible for casual players. I like how the game gives you so many paths to victory, and each house (there are 4 in the base game alone, and you use 2 per game) encourages a different playstyle. It has been some time since I have been that excited about "another deckbuilder".

The area control board makes this feel different than other deck builders I have played. Not as good a crossover game as Lords of Waterdeep due to the iconography and interaction of both cards and board.

deck builders can be a bit passé nowadays, but when they articulate with another mechanism I think they can remain fresh. Core Worlds is my favourite, as that interacts with a form of board, and Tyrants does that also, and very well. There are genuine concerns about all he confusion of can ours, but apart from that very good. I liked the similarity of the cards that could be bought, as this hybrid has to give equal weight to the action on the board. Our group loved it.

Interesting take on the deck-building with board genre.  A cross between Star Realms, Dominion and Trains.  Only played the base game but it was missing some faction based links. Apparently there is more of this in the more advanced game.  Every turn players bought the most expensive thing they could afford, there was never a reason to buy anything less - no combos etc.  Still a fun game with some to-ing and fro-ing of position.  There is potential for AP as players determine the best mathematical turn but there was none of this in the single game I played.

A really well designed deck building and area control game. The rules are straightforward and easy to explain and the manual is pretty decent. I'm not really sure about all the criticism of the design of the game, we all found the game board and cards easy enough to understand. The whole thing is so elegant that new players can pick it up within the first turn or so. There are good strategic and tactical choices in every round and every round goes by in a blur. I haven't played anything like it before and everyone I've played it with so far has enjoyed it.

The deficiencies of this game become clearer and clearer with each passing play. I've never really liked the Ascension model of deckbuilder, for several reasons-  the super powerful utility cards also being worth tons of victory points, and the random card offer. Decent area control mechanics and a neat Valley of the Kings -esque promotion system can't overcome the weaknesses inherent in that system.

Deck builder meets area control. I liked the game overall. Turns can bog down a bit having to read every card but that got better as the game progressed.

I'm not a deckbuilding fan and not really bothered about D&D but this is a very solid game. I like that there isn't much card draw or combos to create downtime for other players as someone pulls off a megaturn. Instead it converts that focus to something more interactive on the board. Great system.

Positives: Beautiful cards, surprisng depth and strategy, plays very well at multiple player counts, offers a nice mix of area control and deck building. Simple to learn.

Conclusion: A real surprise, much better than it might appear by its drab board and dreary theme. Excellent area control game at all player counts

Tyrants of the Underdark is exactly what you would expect from an overpriced game buffet: Everything has decent flavor and fills the stomach, but nothing is outstanding.

With each additional player, you have less control over which cards are available for purchase.  So in a 4p game expect to have your strategy guided by your opponents' leftovers, unless you get lucky with random cardflips.*  Though I don't really mind the limited market, since it avoids rote 'best play' strategies - even if it does significantly increase the luck factor.

On the area control side, I'm not fond of designs where players spend a significant chunk of time undoing each other's moves.  Last night, two of us spent the middle third of the game eliminating and replacing each other's pieces in a single board location.  Treading water is not a sport, though it passes for exercise.

In the game's defense, I was doomed to find Tyrants 'passably entertaining' at best, since area control (e.g., El Grande, Web of Power) is one of the top 3 mechanics that I just don't like. I'm also dangerously close to deck-building burnout.  But overall, the game is fine.  It's not deep and delicious, but it is sticky and purple. I'd play again, particularly to explore 'promotion' strategies and the other deck archetypes.


*This is true in any deck-building game where players select from a small, ever-changing card display (Legendary, DC, etc.), rather than having all cards available for purchase from the get-go (Dominion-style).

Tyler and I tend to like deckbuilders that do something a little different. The area control aspect of Tyrants of the Underdark kept it from feeling like a standard deckbuilder. I really like how there are neutral troops on the map at the start (for blocking purposes) and that more of the board opens up if more players are playing. I imagine it keeps the board feeling tight at all player counts. While in the beginning we were kind of on our own side of the map, a few turns in we began to run into each other and things started getting bloody. 

There were certainly some similarities to Trains (another deckbuilder we own and enjoy), since both are deckbuilders with a board and area control element. Trains feels a bit more Euro and Tyrants feels a bit more Ameritrash to me, and they also have their own other differences, so I'm happy to keep both in our collection. It'll take more plays to be sure, but I think that Trains feels a little more streamlined (and I like the multiple maps), but I like the theme a whole lot more with Tyrants. In each game of Tyrants, you mash up two decks that form the market deck. The base game comes with 4, and I'm hoping that there will be at least one expansion that adds a couple more. With that variety, I may end up liking it more than Trains!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Thematic game set in the D&D Underdark didn't disappoint. Player interaction is high through use of tiny miniatures to spy upon, assassinate and take similarly devious moves to control areas of the board. Deck building mechanism gently ramps up the actions to where I found myself enjoying the playing more and more, even though my first game I was well in last place. Plain ugly board graphics will make it hard to entice those who've never heard of Menzoberranzan and drow to delve into this fun game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I found the spatial element to be a never ending back and forth. You go where you can get the most points, which is quite trivial once you start, then once the board is cluttered you try to displace your opponents faster than them in the cities and hope to get the VPs. The 2-player game is probably the least interesting game mode available, as you´re essentially the only possible target of your opponent's actions, making the game very predictable. The 3+ game is not much more interesting as there is no possibility to make alliances or cut a deal, so you´re basically the target if you´re in the lead. 

The board design is quite uninspired. Cards art is great and immersive. Graphic design is poor though, but that's standard for WoTC. Some cards are interesting, others are a bit blend but I guess that's inevitable.

I enjoyed my few plays of Tyrants, but I found the spatial element of Clank! superior, and the card synergies of Star Realms more interesting. Tyrants felt like a mix of many games I like a lot under a theme I´m really digging, but I somehow ended up disappointed. I guess the game is fine but lacks something extra I cannot quite define.

Nagyon jó kis deckbuilding, melyet nagyban megdob a területfoglalós rész. Jól gyúrták össze a két teljesen különböző mechanikát, élvezetes játék született belőle. Folyamatos az interakció, figyelni kell, ez messze áll a Dominion pasziánsz jellegétől, még ha az alap tök ugyanaz is. A színvilág nem az esetem, de a fekete táblán zajló fekete, lila és sötétkék jelölők ellenére teljesen átlátható a dolog. Ami nagyon zavar, az az ára, gyk. 3 másik deckbuilding kijön belőle és azért ennyit nem ér.

Best implementation I've seen of a deckbuilder plus board play combo. Not as elaborate as Dominion plus all its expansions, but plenty of trade-offs to think about nonetheless. More ebb and flow in the board play than I expected, thanks to the spies and various other card effects.

Expansion deck has different card stock and colours, but is compatible with sleeves (even clear ones are fine). Two of the player colours for the pieces are extremely similar (dark blue and purple), and the dark grey isn't that different either. Not sure little shields are that evocative. Still, good game!

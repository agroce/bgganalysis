Relative to all games, I'll say 7, because nothing can satisfy like a deep wargame.  Relative to fillers, I'd say at least an 8.  Interesting decisions.  Prepare for a longer game if you play with an analysis paralysis player, though.  Plenty of plays in this.

Un juego muy fácil de jugar y explicar. Tendremos que crear nuestra cuadrilla eligiendo bien a nuestros trabajadores, para sacar el máximo beneficio en cada construcción y en el menor tiempo posible, la puntuacíon limitada(17 puntos) hace que la partida no sea larga, cuidado con la gente que gusta de pensar y repensar su jugada, puede enfriar el ritmo de juego.

I absolutely love this little game. It is super compact, which is a big plus. It is pretty easy to introduce to new players, but it also provides some interesting strategic and tactical decisions. I love the snowball effect as you increase the quality of your workers and the money you are making off each completed building. There may be better engine-building games out there, but the combination of fun, ease of play, and portability are tough to beat in this one.

Update: This game hasn't quite held up to my original, lofty opinion, but I definitely still like it a lot. Especially as a quick 20 minute game that still has some strategy.

After reading the rulebook, the game sounded great. I enjoy drafting - here there are both buildings and workers to be drafted, separately. I like gathering resources and all that stuff. Unfortunately the game has almost zero interaction. You're not looking what other players are drafting, which worker on the board might actually help them, so you can snatch it right before them. Even if this happens to you, I bet that the opponent didn't do it on purpose. It's more like a multiplayer solitaire optimization game. Whoever first reaches 17 points wins the game. Advantages: short game, nice graphics, but nothing more than that.

Initial Impression: I love the small, embossed metal tin that houses this simple game. The artwork is fairly plain, with the worker art recycled on multiple cards. The game includes some nice plastic coins though, which is a pleasant upgrade to cardboard coin tokens. The gameplay is simple, with the players taking a limited number of actions each turn in order to build medieval buildings and score points. This makes for a good, light gateway game and my kids enjoyed their first play of the game, surprising me by asking to play it again. I don't see alot of replay value with the game as it's a tad too simple for experienced gamers but it may hit the table occasionally as a filler.

Would probably rather just play Splendor when all is said and done.  I don't think this is a bad game, and actually it was fun with 2 players, however its not something I would seek out very often.  I like the engine building aspect of splendor much more, and actually feel like splendor probably has more longevity than this one.  This one will probably be forgotten by next summer (2015).

Könnyen tanulható, bár gyorsnak nem mondható játék, mivel itt aztán rendesen ki kell gondolni azokat a munkás kombinációkat, mellyel meg lehet nyerni a játékot. Úgy is mondhatnám, hogy össze kell állítani a hatékony csapatot. De ez nem olyan egyszerű, mivel a házak is véletlen szerűen jönnek elő. Tehát lehet, hogy a brigádod nem is tudja felépíteni, mert nincsenek elegen. Először azt hittem, hogy a gépek nagy előnyre tesznek szert, de alapvetően mire azt megépítettem, addigra a többiek bolondra gazdagodtak. Nem igazán tudom a nyerő stratégiát. Nagyon tetszett a játék.

Fun, simple card game with really wonderful art. It does remind me of Splendor, but I don't think it's quite as streamlined or strategic as Splendor. Still, you can build a little engine, and you do have to weigh short-term goals of money/VPs against the long-term benefits of building tools and getting better workers, and you have to be careful about timing, since the game could end very quickly. A nice little filler.

Whoever started the thing describing this as worker placement was on crack. This is nothing like what most people consider a worker placement game. Not too much should be expected form this. It's a light simple game. What it sets out to do, it mostly succeeds at. It just happens to be not quite my thing. It seems like something that's pretty easy solvable (or thereabouts) by a simple program. It's multiplayer solitaire with a trace amount of taking something someone else wants. But the problem here is that most of the thinking is just manually figuring out how to make something work, but not a lot of options or thought about options, meaningful choices, strategy. Pretty plodding. But bonus points for nice art and presentation.

The Spiel Preview description mentioned 'worker placement' as a core mechanic, and since it was a card game I thought it'd be interesting to see how the author solved the various issues which would have invariably cropped up. While playing however it became clear very quickly you should take the phrase very literally: you pick up cards with workers having various amounts of skill in four types of construction, and then lay these down next to a building you also picked up [i]demanding[/i] a certain total amount of construction effort in these four areas. You pay for the workers, and are rewarded with a cash payoff and some VP once the building is completed. You have a few actions for free every turn, and can purchase new ones as long as you pay for them... but you won't have sufficient money to do that often. All in all an inoffensive game of open hand management which will surely appeal to many family gamers.

There were two problems with the game which stayed my hand. One is that if you happen to have a decent overlap between workers and buildings on offer, you will be able to build far more rapidly than someone who lacks this overlap; the game doesn't offer any form of compensation. And, also quite unfortunately, I found the truly gorgeous artwork to be a hindrance more than an asset. The important information are tiny LED-like strips indicating the proficiency of a worker in a construction area, or the amount of work required by a building. These take up very small areas of a card; the rest has to be visually ignored, and that is a pain. So, I have no further plays nor experiments planned.

More prone to AP than Splendor because each builder has separate stats to contribute to building creation. One thing this game has over Splendor is the ability to spend money for additional actions per turn, similar to Tzolk'in.

Filler-length game which fundamentally revolves around matching production (builders) to demands (buildings).   Completed buildings earn you money which is necessary to place your builders, or they might earn you supplemental resources.   It's a race to a point limit.   Extra coins can be converted into actions.   It seems like the builder market can become stagnant, with no incentive to shake it up.  It's kind of like any number of card games about fulfilling orders, but here you get to keep your builders and re-use them over and over.   Simple and accessible, with nice artwork and totally unnecessary tin box.

A simple but very well done city building game.  Works great for 2-4 players, but does not have a ton of player interaction.  The great thing I found about this game so far is that most people like it right off the bat, and the rules can be tweaked to add more interaction and complexity without breaking the game overall.  Simply amazing game for such a small package.

This is the best game I have bought in a long time. On the surface, it seems like a very simple game, you hire builders and pick structures to build and the first person to gain a certain number of victory points wins. However, this is not as straightforward as you might think. Each builder has a set of stats, and the builders and structures are randomized so each game you have no idea what you are going to get, meaning that there is no clear cut strategy right out of the gate to assure victory. You could grab a few master builders and think you are going to take the game, and then for the next turns you see all the structures that you CAN'T build because they just happen to require stats that your builders are low in. Overall, I really enjoy playing this with 2 or 3 players, it hasn't gotten old yet after several plays.

Builders is a game of hiring and optimally utilizing various workers. Master craftsman while highly skilled come at a premium, while the lesser workers are cheap, but less useful. Assigning multiple craftsman in a single turn requires additional actions, so players must plan ahead in order to save their actions. And that right there is the game. The first few plays are mildly interesting, but soon the game boils down to an action-efficiency race, which does not appeal to me. Granted, money can be used to purchase additional actions, but unless said action would win the game, this option is seldom used. Overall, the game is too straight-forward. A majority of decisions feel scripted, and the game ends up feeling dull. Its a quick game, which helps, but its a bore.

The game is a little too light for me, but definitely a very solid and enjoyable game.

Nem tudom mennyire tartozik ide, de talán mondhatjuk, hogy idei megjelenés.
Szeretem az egyszerű, de nagyszerű játékokat, amik ráadásul guszták is. Na ez ilyennek tűnt. A szabály alapján egy kombózgatós építgetés kártyákkal.
A komponensek szépek, jó anyagból vannak a lapok, a grafikák mutatósak. A műanyag pénzek szerintem kicsit gagyik, de ez legyen a legnagyobb baj.
A játékmenet egyszerű:
Van három akciód, amivel vagy épületet viszel, vagy munkást viszel, vagy munkást rendelsz épülethez. Ezen kívül menekülőútnak ott van még, hogy pénzt is vehetsz fel, ha elfogyna.
Van négy nyersanyag, ezekből kell eleget prenzentálni ahhoz, hogy egy épület felépüljön. Persze minden munkásnál is meg van adva, hogy mennyit tud nyújtani az adott nyersanyagból. Ahhoz, hogy egy munkás elmenjen dolgozni valahova ki kell fizetnünk. Ha elkészül egy épület, akkor pénzt és pontot is kapunk.
Ha valaki eléri a 17 pontot, akkor az a kör még lemegy és a játék véget ér. Akinek a legtöbb pontja van, az nyert.

A feladat igazából az, hogy a sose költekezz túl, és mindig megtaláld a munkásaidhoz leginkább illeszkedő épületet vagy az épületedhez leginkább illeszkedő munkást(munkásokat). Nem nagyon éri meg "túlfizetni" egy-egy nyersanyagból, mert hamar deficites lesz az építkezés.
Érdekes mechanizmus, hogy ha egy épülethez szeretnél egy körben több munkást is rendelni, akkor az drága. Így a játék arra ösztönöz, hogy inkább több épületet építs párhuzamosan, de ehhez meg sok munkás kell.
Kombózási lehetőséget az ad, hogy a 3 akción felül újabbakat is végrehajthatsz, de ezek 5 pénzbe kerülnek. Ezzel az utolsó két körben akár 2-3 épületet is fel lehet húzni körönként.

No mindez tök jól hangzik, de valahogy mégse az. A játék inkább tevékenység semmint játék. Az idő azzal megy el, hogy kiszaszerolod, hogy mihez mi kell, neked mid van, vagy mit tudsz szerezni, és hogy kb. hol az optimum. Erre végtelen időt is el lehet költeni. A baj az, hogy 100%-osan multiplayer szoliter a játék így a többiek halálra unják magukat míg agyalsz. És ez még úgy is probléma, hogy az egész lemegy 30 perc alatt.

Kár érte, szerettem volna szeretni. Nálam 6-os.
-----

Négy játék után, kicsit jobb lett a véleményem. Kevesebben talán jobb valamivel, de továbbra se tartom igazán játéknak, inkább csak rejtvényfejtegetés.

Builders is a small, inoffensive efficiency optimization puzzle. I don't really consider it an engine builder since apart from grabbing workers from the shared pool (for free) there is very little building of that engine actually taking place. It does, however, share some of its appeal with Splendor, although it does feel a little less competitive (no nobles to grab from a shared and limited pool) but offers a little more puzzle-like qualities in return.

It's an nice game. It's not brilliant, but in a short time you can get a nice Euro feeling. Nicely presented, and a meaningful distraction. Like it (Rating 7.197; July 2015). UPDATE: I like how in the last round people buy additional actions to see if they can win, good lite game (Rating 7.483, June 16)

The game is very simple. You draft workers and buildings, assign workers to buildings, once the buildings are done you earn money and VP and race to get to 17 VP. There are no significant decisions to be made as it is really an efficiency game and your turn is spent identifying the fastest most efficient way to satisfy the requirements of finishing a building by matching workers to them. Not a good game, not even for a filler.

Great quick little building game. Get a building tableau going and watch your points fly high! Very similar to Splendor, though no chips, but adds a slight depth that splendor misses. Add to the fact that there are many mason references and iconography, gave me a great thematic feeling overall. Great game and compact.

Only negative could possibly be the size of the building/machine cards. If I wanted to sleeve the cards, which I might, it makes it very hard to do so with such large cards.

Having no real interaction at all, doesn't help...

RATING: 6
This game is a filler, but with the unfortunate feature of being AP-inducing!
The fit between what builders you get/have, and what buildings that happens to come up during the game really has a strong influence of how good you are gonna do. But it still tricks you into really trying to be efficent, and finding the workers that fit the bill.

RATING: 6.8
A small optimization game. Mostly about getting the best combination of workers and buildings. Can cause some AP when players are figuring out which worker/building combinations to get, so turns can go slow. Plays better with fewer players.

The Builders: Middle Ages is a great card game that lasts just long enough and has enough strategy in it to stay interesting.  I like that players are able to purchase multiple actions in order to continue their turn.  I also like how the game always seems just out of reach for those who lost it.  It makes me want to start right over and keep playing to try and win the next one.

Surprising range of strategies available in this small game. The compounding of action cost when placing multiple workers at the same building is what makes the game interesting. You have to be planning and coordinating multiple buildings simultaneously for the best score. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An interesting idea for a game that falls just a bit short. I like the very simple nature of the game - engine building at its simplest with money as a limiting factor. One problem is the lack of interaction. All the workers are fairly interchangeable, so having someone else take the one I wanted isn't that big a deal. Claiming buildings might be a little more important, but either way the interaction is minor enough that when the game is over, you don't feel any type of excitement from winning or frustration from having been almost there yourself.

The biggest problem with this game is Splendor. Splendor does everything this game does in a way that is easier to track (leading to faster turns), with better components, and simply a lot more fun.

Played four games during the official tournament in Nantes, the 18th of october 2013.

First game had some fun since we were all discovering the game.

Had a very poor start on my second game, couldn't build much and ended last.

Got bored in the middle of the third game so i started paying less attention.

Was so bored in the last game that i started talking with someone who wasn't playing and didn't pay attention anymore to what my opponents were doing.
So i lost the game because i didn't notice that the last player would put an end to it.
Otherwise i would have finished second.

Overall, the game is basically about matching workers to buildings without interaction with other players.

So i found it quickly boring because you spend most of your time waiting for other people to end their turns.

Furthermode, there seems that the wining strategies are very limited :

* Build one or two small building, then one or two medium buildings and finish with one big building = end of the game.
* No point in losing time building machines or small building that give you money only.
* Recruit workers even if you don't use them (especially masters) since there is no penalty for not using your ressources.

The game really makes you have to think quite quickly and tactically. Some strategies will soon emerge as well.

I love the art for obvious (or perhaps not so obvious?) reasons and I like it more than I thought I would after reading the rules. 

Good: The length is about right. EG: It doesn't seem like it takes much longer than the Age of War but the decisions are more important in The Builders. It is still quite simple so it worked well with non-gamers.

I was hoping for a slight variation on Splendor and to be fair it is.  However, it's a bit difficult to parse what you need to work on and what your workers produce because of the little slashes.  That's my biggest turn off in the game.  So, it's definitely much less of a hit than Splendor for me.  It feels like you have less control and you can't easily track what your opponents are doing so less competitive compared to Splendor, as well.

Given the comparisons to Splendor (which is vastly superior), I had to check this out, despite the many ho-hum reviews. Turns out they were right. This is what Splendor would be if you took away all the engine building aspects, leaving only a bunch of mindless card flipping and chip counting, and cluttered up the cards with a bunch of pointless art and text. As it stands, it's a bland, uninspired efficiency game - a dull, linear race to 17 points, with no depth or surprises. It's about as exciting as counting a gallon jug full of pennies.

I don't hate this game, but I would never choose to play this over Splendor.

Probably good as a family game as there is no direct interplay--it's a worker placement game where you only place them in your own tableau. Not terribly exciting but it has its charms. The same matching mechanism was reused in the same designer's Legendary Inventors, which is much more interactive.

一隻超值的遊戲. 

遊戲規則非常簡短清晰，不過當中涉及的思考是令人驚訝地有深度。
要在場上（以及已擁有的工程節）與建築圖則的四維做最有利的配對已經是一個好巧妙的設計。
能夠利用工具是一個相當大的優勢，但太勉強做而浪費動作的話就很難勝利了。
這遊戲有運氣成份，但不太影響遊戲的樂趣。

要輕玩的話大家隨意玩都能體會遊行的趣味，遊戲畫功精美。　鐵盒加上浮雕。
錢幣配件漂亮用心。就算當Ｆａｍｉｌｙ　Ｇａｍｅ玩都是很歡樂的。
（不過鐵盒形狀不夠方正會容易刮花，亦難以包透明膠保護。

更重要是是這個遊戲價錢相當於一隻Card Game的價錢.
以這個價錢能夠買到一副可輕可重的遊戲是非常難得的。

注意：根據經驗，玩這遊戲時參與者最好程度相近以享受最大樂趣。

The Builders is basically a matching game where you match worker cards (supply of 4 different types) with building cards (demand of said types). A successful match earn you money to pay the workers and victory points to win the game. The more perfect the match, the more efficient the money and victory points generation. It's an OK puzzle but too random and solitaire for my taste.

This game is like a quicker, simpler, faster and less well developed version of Spendor. I like the soft pastel art, even though it's a bit too dark, like the graphic design team didn't test their design on the printers first. That aside, it has a good idea, but just doesn't come through. Each "builder" costs within 2 coins of each other to send to work. This means if you're smart, you can complete a building in 1 turn instead of two, or more than likely just waste a small amount of money.

I like it so far.  Great art, and the best rule book I have EVER read! It has a rather large foot print for such a tiny tin, which isn't of much consequence in most situations. As for travel, it's the perfect tiny size and the "3D" artwork on the tin is superb.

In this building construction game, each player has 3 actions. They either recruit a worker from the display , get a building from display, assign a worker (paying the worker) to a building or earn money. Finished buildings give money and VPs or provide materials for other buildings. You can also pay $5 to take more actions, and assigning another worker to the same building cost 2 actions. Buildings typically require four different requirements to finish, and workers only have a subset of those requirements. First player to 17 VPs wins. 

It's a fun, quick filler. You are racing against the other players to get buildings up, and there is some thinking to optimize your plays. You want to recruit workers who are flexible that can help in all types of buildings, but they are more expensive.

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this, and now regret not picking up a copy at my LGS. We had picked it up at a café while waiting for another game to become available, and this is a filler I want to revisit often. I take great satisfaction is building things in games and enjoyed the mini-puzzle of assigning the right Workers for the needed resources.

This game is very much multiplayer-solitaire, with little opportunities for interaction beyond occasionally grabbing a Worker or Building your opponent might desire. While this might be a con for some, it's a perfect fit for my girlfriend and I's less aggressive play styles and makes The Builders a relaxing filler. My only major gripe is that keeping track of the action points needed for assigning multiple Workers to the same building on the same turn is annoying.

Gioco molto semplice e intuitivo. Niente di sconvolgente ma simpatico da giocare. Con l'aumentare dei giocatori aumenta l'ingovernabilità del gioco ma essendo un fillerino, se si gioca spensierati, rimane un titolo carino. Si tratta in sintesi di un gioco di carte, l'ambientazione cerca si simulare la costruzione dei edifici che generano punti vittoria a chi li costruisce. Per costruire i propri edifici, dopo averne preso il brevetto, i giocatori potranno assoldare nuovi lavoratori o richiamarne, e ripagare i propri. I lavoratori a seconda del loro valore (da apprendista a capomastro) avranno un costo in monete differente, da 2 a 5.

RATING: 6.5
Efficient little race-to-a-score card game, with the feel of Guildhall to it in that everything will be down to an action or two at the end. For this reason, probably not best with more than 2P.

I would have like to see more striking art and perhaps a different way of choosing the workers - draft? Deckbuild? Auction? And the coins are particularly poor quality when the publisher has gone to the effort of presenting the game nicely in a tin.

"Cute little efficiency game. Far more fun than Splendor. Minimal screwage."

What I like:
- Solid, straightforward engine-building mechanism
- Excellent graphic design (layout, colors, fonts, etc.)
- Plays quickly (20 minutes for a 2p learning game)
- No attacks, and minimal denial/screwage

What I don't like:
- Not a fan of tins, but at least it's small
- Buildings would be better as regular cards than big squares

Where Splendor feels like a dry, thinky abstract, The Builders feels like a cute, fun game with a bit of theme. Splendor has much more opportunity for denial, which is probably why it's a hit with serious gamers. I prefer the gentler Builders. 

I would put the weight around 1.8, about where BGG voters have it.

Have only played with my wife (several times). I like this little game. It's very much an exercies in efficiency, but more enjoyable than other games I've experienced with similar gameplay.

Pros:
- Quick
- Not much setup or cleanup
- I find it fun, personally
- Nice artwork
- Simple to learn and play

Cons:
- Not very deep
- Maybe too mathy for some; if you want to think of it that way, can be something of a straight calculations game.

As parents of young kids, the energy and time for bigger games (setting up, reminding ourselves of rules, playing, cleaning up) is often not worth it. This game fills that gap quite well.

Its artwork is good, I like its tin box. Easy to setup, easy to teach, just need few mins.

But for the gameplay, I found it seems does not have many strategies to win the game. Just need to buy some low cost buildings to get more money, then near the end of game, just use money to buy more extra action ($5 per action) in order to have a quick buy on your last building to get the 17 VP. I don't like it much but my female colleagues like it. Maybe they feel this game just like a shopping game, haha.

RATING: N/A
This game is OK. Not great, but OK. It's a light engine building game with very little direct interaction between players. I also find it better than Splendor. It's the same basic mild engine building game in a much smaller box, it plays quickly, and the atmosphere is light. OK, yes, there's some luck involved in the way that your workers/buildings can synergize (or not), but it's a lighter family game, not a way to compete for Undeniably Impressive Smartness Boasting Rights. 

This is not a game I'll ever crave, and given 15 minutes, there are loads of card games I'd choose before I'd ever suggest this as an option. But it's not an awful engine builder, it's clear in its inputs and outputs, it's cheap, the actions make sense, the way you can pay more to take more actions is clever, and overall I find it to be more fun than Splendor for a near-identical game experience. 

To come clean with my biases: my personal opinion is that Engine Building is a weak genre, and I think those kinds of games are best expressed in about 15-30 minutes, tops. Most of the "Heavier" games that involve Engine Building just add unbearable length and tedium to an identical challenge, and I'm not convinced the resulting games are the better for it. They're longer, of course. But the challenge and in-game problems are usually the same as they are in something like The Builders, or Splendor, or All Creatures Big and Small, only this time there's an additional Endurance Challenge.

A very simple builder game which has a fun bit of strategy involved. It's really little more than recruit the workers appropriate to the random buildings that are available and trying to build them as cheaply as possible, but it is pretty fun. It has a good mechanic where players can purchase extra actions on their turn (which gets extremely expensive the more they want), which I hadn't really seen before.
Overall, it's a little bit more than a light filler game - but quite a fun one.

Small box/tin, low price, simple rules, fast game. In the same vein as Splendor, but not quite as dull. The Builders has a lot going for it, and it's almost there, but unfortunately it's a little too simple and calculating to make it to the next level. The game is in need of a small expansion to make the decisions a little more interesting - not more calculating - more interesting. Throw in a dash more player interaction and then you'd be talking! (I'm looking into the variants proposed here on BGG and there's some good ideas with workers being borrowed by other players that seem worth trying out.)

What we've got here already is a deck of builder cards with four potential skills. The strength in those skills ranges from 2-5 in value with a cost of deployment equal to the total skill level. Higher values are great, except often you're overpaying by just deploying your best builders. That means you're looking for the right skill mix to efficiently build the building and make a profit. Machines start to make the game more interesting, but it's only a start. First to 17 points on buildings triggers the end round.

It's all a bit too calculating without being very exciting. You soon learn that with the extra action cost of deploying more than one builder to a building on the same turn that it pays to work on more than one project at a time. However you're then going to have to juggle your workforce.

I like it as a light game that plays in 20 minutes, but I could see myself really enjoying it if I had some more interesting options, player interaction, tough decisions. Hopefully that'll come.

It was pretty hard to find that one. I had stumbled across it on the full Essen 2013 list on boardgamegeek and got interested, so I wanted to play a round. It turned out that the "booth" was exactly one small 4-person-table at the large area near the west entrance, and they had not managed to get the box printed in time, and they did not have a poster either to indicate which game is being played at that table. So you just had to find the correct table by asking around.

The game itself is a neat little filler game, with surprisingly well-made graphics. A little much on the micro-optimizing side maybe with significant downtime during other players' turns, but for a 30 minute game it's okay. I think I'm still planning to buy this one, should it at any point become available at some reasonable shipping conditions.

Pretty mediocre. It's fine, but very forgettable. I played this once with 4 people. I wouldn't want to play with that count again. It would be best with 2, [i]maybe[/i] 3. 
It is certainly multiplayer solitaire, something I don't generally mind, but some might. This is what hurts the game in a 4 player match. There is nothing interesting to pay attention to between turns. You could really play this solo and barely anything would change. You can theoretically take something important that another player might need, but it probably isn't a good idea strategically, as it would be more productive to just focus on what you need to do in order to win. 

The artwork is ok. The buildings are cute, but the people are "cookie-cutter." There are maybe two or three illustrations of different people with just the hair, clothing, or eyes changed. 

I hate the graphic design. The little bar-meters are hard to read and it's annoying to figure out your moves because of it. Surely they could have had another solution (full symbols rather than the little bars?). I felt like much of the game was training my eyes to try to see which cards would work for which buildings. Not really fun.

The production is nice. Good quality cards, and nice tin, plastic coins. We ran out of coins in the 4 player game towards the end. It got to the point where we didn't need to use much money and just accumulated it. 

I would recommend this for those who want a cheap, somewhat brainless, light game. There are certainly more interesting games that play in this time range and are available for a similar price.

I REALLY like this little card drafting/set collection game that's themed on using workers to complete buildings.  The components are excellent, and the mechanics make sense.  [You have to pay the works - more if they are more skilled, they contribute more if they are more skilled, and you get paid for finishing each job - more for the bigger jobs.]  I've not yet finished in 30 mins (although we've been playing the multiple workers rule wrong), but the game is still relatively short, and finishes can be close (at least between two of the players).  I get real satisfaction in turning over the card for a completed building, and getting paid.  Easy rules to learn, quite a few decisions to may, and easy to set up and transport.  Very highly recommended.

RATING: 6.5
1 play FTF, several at Boardgamearena.com (all 2er)

This is a pretty simple set-collection / engine building game, of sorts. You build sets of skills in 4 colors by drafting (worker) cards, and use those in combinations to complete other (building) cards you've also drafted. It's an efficiency game of trying to best match your set of skills with the set of requirements for your buildings, so that you can quickly complete projects and cross the 17 VP threshold to end and win the game. It doesn't require many completed buildings to get there so there may be a bit of luck in how well the building cards happen to match with worker cards when it's your turn. But the game is very quick (10 min online?) so that level of randomness is not a big problem.

A pretty good filler, I think. I'd guess it's best with 2 -- with more, the card row could be completely different and you'd have to start thinking about your actions all over again.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
There are 2 card rows on display: workers, and projects. Workers, who have skills in 1-4 types (colors), can be apprentices, journeymen, or masters (with differing total skill value and allocation amongst the 4 types/colors). Players each start with a random apprentice in front of them, and some money (10 coins). The Projects include some tools, and various buildings; all require a particular set of skills to complete.

On your turn, you get 3 actions; may buy additional actions at $5 each. Use these to acquire cards from the card row (place in your display) or to allocate Workers to Projects (paying them their wages). For each project, each Worker beyond the first assigned to it this turn costs extra actions (+1, +2, etc.). Once a Project has the required type and amount of skills, amongst all the Workers assigned to it, it is completed: buildings go to your score pile, tools stay in your display (and are subsequently treated the same as workers), and you usually get some cash.

The game ends at the end of the round when at least one player has 17+ VP. Earn 1VP / 10 coins remaining. The player with the most VP wins.

Rule learning and set-up was very efficient (he read the rules and I watched some review videos on BGG; plus the person I traded for this game had a fantastic little note card with the highlights).  We both won a game, so that's a good sign. I was initially worried because in the first game he chained his way to victory (there is a reason we no longer own Dominion :whistle: ). He fell into the 'solitaire player' trap in the second game (something I have learned many hard lessons from playing with him in the past to never do) so missed that I was making my way to 17 points along with a hefty war chest for final scoring. Both games took about an hour total.  First impressions are very positive, exactly the kind of game we need and like to have in our lives.

RATING: 6
A super-fast engine building little filler where it can surprisingly bog down in AP. The end game condition, along with the ability to buy extra actions means that you can happily ignore the other players for much of the game, but then suddenly need to really focus on everything for the final few turns.

Perfectly charming - and the production is really good - but I doubt this will stay long in the memory.

Update: This really is far too much heads-down optimisation for my tastes. Rating down from 6.5 to 6.

Es un juego sencillo en el que hay que exprimir y gestionar los recursos al máximo para ir por delante de los rivales. Lo recomiendo al 100%.

RATING: 7
The game has some similarities to Splendor because of the snowball effect as you build up your workers and machines, and the way you trigger the game end by scoring so many points. One difference, though, is that there seems to be less player interaction than Splendor, and Splendor already has very little player interaction. In Splendor you can horde gems or buy cards that other people are saving up to get, but in The Builders you usually have enough options that you're not just saving up to buy one particular card, but several different ones.

Good game, I think I prefer it to Splendor.

A basic set-matching game without even the memory element of 'Go Fish'. It's a matter of looking at the cards that are available and seeing if you have enough money to pay for those that will allow you to complete your building.

A good little set collection/drafting game centered on building a base of workers (each with certain resource production capabilities) and assigning those workers to complete buildings for VP. Can feel a bit soltaire-ish, and is prone to AP for players who prefer to plan in detail.

Great quick game.  One of the perfect filler games when waiting for everyone to arrive.  I played this for the first time, and was pleasantly surprised at the amount of thinking it required.

It took about 15 minutes to teach and then for us to play.  PERFECT for a filler!

This isn't a bad game, but I don't like that it has a "replace a card as soon as you buy one" mechanism, which means that the card you've been waiting on will suddenly show up at the end of your turn, only to get scooped up by another player before it gets back around to your turn.  Plus, there's no incentive NOT to take a building that will only help someone else, since any unfinished buildings won't count against you at the end of the game.  It feels fine, but it also feels unpolished.

RATING: 7
Not too shabby...the gameplay is really quick so you need to focus on the types of workers you pick up and make sure they match the available buildings as well as give a rounded set of skills/resources for future construction.  Being short on cash and needing to spend multiple actions to get money is costly, as is sending multiple workers to the same building site. Making sure you have money coming in consistently as well as constructing multiple buildings at once seems to be key.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In a way, this game is nothing more than matching symbols. On their turn, a player can draw a card from one of two displays, one with recipes for buildings and one with ingredients in the form of builders. Match them up, score some points. There is a bit of accounting involved, as you have to balance completing recipes with the cost of the ingredients (the workers) to complete them, in order to stay in the black. If you plan it right, you can bounce from one recipe to the next, completing a couple in a very satisfying combo turn.

It's honestly a really dumb game, that is way more fun than it should be.

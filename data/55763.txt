Re-implementation of Scotland Yard. 
Basically the same game on a different board.
The fact, that Mister X never has to announce his current position (only where he was 1 to 5 turns ago) and the special actions add a nice twist.
Overall, the same rating as Scotland Yard for me.

Have had this one for over a year now, always a thrill to play. Usually fried from and ready for a nap after being MR. X. A great group game, equally if not more fun with just two people as my wife and I frequently play this way. instructions seem daunting at first, but after first time through, you will get the groove of the mechanics of the game. Super cool catch me if you can type of game!

This was a grail game for my partner given his childhood love of Scotland Yard and my intro to hidden movement games after I found him a copy. He always plays Mister X, and we normally play 2 player. Given that, we house rule the number of movement tokens for the investigator so a max special move is possible. Some suggest 12 (rather than the official 9). We found that too easy and currently use 11.

RATING: 10
One v many hidden movement games are my favourite genre. Of every one that I've played, from Scotland Yard to Fury of Dracula, this is easily the best. It gets to the point, deduction and bluffing, without any extraneous nonsense like combat and such. 

Pure, simple and a lot of fun.

RATING: 6
Pro:
- Unusual mechanics;
- Cooperative game with one person playing against all others;
- Highly accepts non-standard thinking from both sides.
Cons:
- Sometimes seems to be too long.

Result: 
Good game to play in a good company. Can be stohastic, chaotic or well organized - the person who is in charge for Mister X is key to the gamepay here.

Un bon jeu de chasse à l'homme d'une heure environ, reprenant les bons ingrédients du célèbrissime Scotland Yard, mais qui se voient ici largement améliorés : Mister X a maintenant une destination, les détectives ont eux aussi deux actions spéciales, micro-gestion de ses tickets pour les utiliser au mieux (action spéciale ou déplacement), les tickets joués par les détectives retournent dans la pioche... Le mécanisme le plus excitant est le contrôle des positions en fin de tour : si un détective se trouve dans une ville où Mister X était il y a moins de 4 tours, Mister X doit le dire. Ce mécanisme crée une vraie sensation de traque. Les détectives doivent absolument trouver les traces de Mister X car ce dernier ne se montre plus à intervalles réguliers.
Particulièrement intéressant à deux joueurs, en précisant que le joueur détective doit prendre 12 tickets (et non 9, sinon il est quasi-impossible d'intercepter Mister X).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very similiar to Scotland Yard but better. You're using all 5 dectectives in every game.  There is also more collaboration on where to move the detectives.  I like the tracking mechanism.  There seems to be a crucial balance between combining detective tiles for a bonus ability versus saving them and depleting the bag of misterX tiles.   Nice design.  On the negative side, there does appear to be more downtime for this one.  But everyone at the table was a newbie, so maybe play time will go down.

Owned by my brother-in-law. [thing=438][/thing] is great as a two-player game, but less so with more. This European version works slightly better with more players, and adds good twists to the Scotland Yard formula. But the police have to be proactive - if they just hover around the target spots for the whole game (which is arguably the best way to catch Mister X) it's super dull.

RATING: 8
Great and simple hidden movement deduction game, seems somehow like a streamlined and more deductive version of Fury of Dracula. It was a predecessor of my favorite game, Letters from Whitechapel. I really like Mister X, it is shorter and simpler than Whitechapel, but still fun and engaging. Good for 2 players, best for 3-4.

Game in which one player is Mister X and try to move secretly from one of the starting place to one of the destination.  The other players play in co-op and try to catch Mister X before he reach his destination.

After two plays: Yes it is like Scotland Yard with some changes. I had the feeling that in this game it is easier for Mister X to win because he can use quite a lot of double moves. Still, the game was very tight and we had fun.

Got from Amazon.de in late 2012 for good price (just over £20 inc UK deliver). No EN rules in box but easily found on publishers website
Definitely plays better in 2p with 10 / 11 / 12 cards for the Detective player (more is easier)
4 (or more) players can be a bit dull for Mister X
Can be a lot of fun but we don't play it that much on our house any more

Hmm. Don't think I can say this is as good as the original, but it's a great alternative. In our play it seemed very difficult to get bonuses for the detectives, and I'm not sure if that's by design or if that was just bad tile draws. It has a few more layers than its predecessor without adding a ton of bloat or any extra play time. Gorgeous map and components.

Never played a board game like this before, ever.

Rules are very simple, but the deductive reasoning ends up making this a VERY brainy game. Not sure how to weigh this for gameplay weight.

We thought the visor was mostly a joke until we realized it blocks the detectives from seeing your eyes / many facial expressions.

"Not sure I can agree with those who say there's more luck in this over Scotland Yard.  They must be referring to one of the big differences in movement which is that in this game you draw chips out of a bag whereas in SY travel tokens and special actions are assigned at the beginning of each game.  

Drawing out of the bag makes each game of Mister X different and does, I admit, add a small dose of luck.  However, that luck is mitigated by what this change brings to the game.  Firstly, it makes BOTH sides more powerful and adds more theme.  This is especially true for the detectives who can sacrifice their moves (in some cases) in order to do an investigation and find out where Mister X was in last few moves.  This IS thematic.  In SY you find out where Mister X was at specific and known moves in the game. Mister X rules on this alone trumps SY.  Having the detectives decide (vs. the game forcing that moment) when they expose Mister X's movements is the more thematic way to play.

Another change in this game over SY is that Mister X now has a destination.  I find that to be far more interesting than just trying to avoid detection.

Lastly, I like how easy it is to handicap one of the sides in Mister X in order to compensate for lack of ability.  For example, in a 2 player game you can give either side more tokens which allows for more special actions. Love that in a game - allows a much stronger player to play a weaker one and both can still have a good time.

Have not yet played Letters from Whitechapel so I will revisit this rating after I play that game.  Regardless, I have very little interest in playing Scotland Yard after playing Mister X."

Less an updated Scotland Yard than a re-imagined one. More luck, to be sure.  The start/end city difficulty adjustment is a nice idea for mixed adult/child groups (e.g., my family!).

Finally played, and liked it. Not sure it's worth owning both, though, and I think I like SY better. I definitely prefer the SY map....

We had a horribly long game. We discussed every possibility and one player got very close to Mr. X repeatedly. I don't know why we took so long. I liked the double function on the tiles. Some are good for Mr. X and some are good for the detectives.

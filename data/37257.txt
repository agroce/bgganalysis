Great game.  Simple rules set make for a very fast game where you are always engaged.  Plus the dice mechanic for ranged fire, linked fire, and 6+ hits is very intuitive and really makes the game.

Got rid of this albatross...the low rating wasn't so much for the game which was okay, but the support by the company and the amount of subpar product put out that had to be corrected later at cost to the end consumer.  
Great idea for a game but there it goes....kicking rocks.
Bam!  Got the Dragon Lords and Elves starter sets.  
  Had to go for the mega-bundle from Spartan Games.  First starter fleet painted (the elves).
UPDATE:  Iron dwarves 70% finished...bring on the human fleet...4x4 table under construction.
Update2:  Table done for first battle (elf v. dwarf)  Both fleets completly painted as well as terrain.  Looked great as the elves smashed the dwarves.

I picked up a bunch of Imperial Human fleet ships at the Fall 2012 Fields of Honor silent auction for less than the price of a single starter set.  I got 2x Starter Sets, 2 Flagships, 3 transports, 6 Martyr Class Frigates, 2 more Heavy Cruisers, and 2 more regular cruisers.  Quite the haul for $40!

Fantastic game, I was a bit wary due to the lack of downloadable rules but it has far exceeded my expectations.  I'm typically playing two nights a week at the local game store and we've gotten a fairly strong group going.  Only getting better as more models come out to give us new options.

This looked like a good game, but the constantly updating rules really pissed me off.  I bought the rule book more times than I played the game!

A factor, albeit a minor one, in my deciding to give up on traditional miniature games.

Bought the 100 GBP "Mega Starter Bundle" directly from the publisher.  The miniatures are outstanding, and the gameplay is simple, fast, and fun.  This is definitely a game that I intend to focus on over the coming year.

RATING: 6
Rating has gone down after 7 plays. Nice set of beer and pretzels fantasy naval rules but there's not enough meat on those bones to play regularly. Having a really small number of available ships with fleet building restrictions meant I had 1 good tournament fleet to play for the near future, very little room for customization, I can't handle playing the same fleet over and over. Even 1 variant per hull type would have gone a long way to alleviate this but as it stands right now there's just not enough fleet building options or enough ships to keep me interested.

The miniatures are pretty nice and I haven't had a lot of problems with flash or other defects. We're talking mostly resin here with a lot of 1-piece models for my Iron Dwarves, more metal and multi-piece (but still not a lot of  pieces) for my Bone Griffins. Beware when prepping, some of that resin can break pretty easily. Looks pretty sweet on the gaming table.

This was the first title from Spartan Games that I purchased. Shortly after buying the system the company discontinued the series. I then shifted into the Dystopian line and now yet again I am disillusioned the company itself just announced its closing. I really can't win with this company.

RATING: 8
I give it a solid 8.  What got published is sorely needing an expansion-- there are clearly more ships, more monsters, more races on the horizon and the rulebook barely covers the first primary races of Dragonkin, Humans, Dwarves, Orcs etc.

Great rules, for what they are-- a simple naval game, using familiar concepts that are easy to grasp and easy to teach.  The background and models are simply spectacular.  Really fills a niche for us old geezer fans of the short-lived (and inferior) Man o' War by Games Workshop.  well done, Spartan Games.

Its fun from time to time... but after all it really is just a big luckfest with buckets full of dice. If you seek strategic play, don´t seek in the Uncharted Seas, you won´t find it.

This rating is based on one play but there will be many, many others.

The game is easy to play, though it cries out for some advanced or house rules.  It is a great value for the money.  I payed less than $25 for the rules, copied the card fleets and counters and was able to play.  I will however, buy the minis at some point down the road.

Great, easy to play miniatures game.  Very easy to pick up on the ruleset, but enough options to keep you immersed.  The quality of the models is fantastic and they are a lot of fun to paint.

I used to play a lot of Warhammer 40K until it got too cumbersome.  This scratches my minis itch without too much investment involved.  The fleets are very different and I can't wait to start on a second fleet.

tried demo game recently. Rules not overly complicated yet still good level of strategy. Thinking about this one for a new style of miniature gaming. Like the alternating activation of this one.

Have book + Imperial Human Fleet.  

Edit- I thought the FLGS was possibly setting up regular play.  First sets sold well.  But nobody plays!  If it's not 40k, WHFB or FoW, forget it.

Played the game twice but I'm not going to be dragging the whole group into a game everyone now calls 'Unplayed Seas'.  

Edit - good game but they've already redefined LOS (a significant concept in a minis wargame) in less than 2 year of existence.  Really hoping they don't continue all Chapter Approved with everyone having to bring a ton of printed out errata, articles, and updates to every game.

I'd say miniatures work best when there isn't too many of them around and you don't need tons of terrain to play either. So techically warship battles are quite well suited to miniature gaming. And this one is fast and fun fantasy/sailship game, that has simple and well working rules. Quite traditional rules, but well streamlined. Lot's of dice rolling, I'd say actually enough to make sure odds do even out in a single game.

I picked a copy of the rules up a few weeks ago after a quick demo game at a convention figuring that myself and one of the regular club players could dig out our Man-o-War ships and give it a go. It transpires both of our GW material has long since dwindled to a handful of models in various states of dis-assembly.

Over-all this looks like it will play quite well, and fairly quickly, though there is a clear tendency towards a strategy vacuum as ships pile into the centre and I think more effort could have been taken to give the various races a distinct character.

Any-way for what is clearly the designers revised version of Man-o-War it looks worth at least investing the time to assemble two fleets.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a good game, but at least the first revision of the rulebook is not very useful.  It's not written very well, and some of the rules are ambiguous or incomplete.  However, it's a well designed system if you can get over the complications in the written description of the rules.

RATING: 4
If I want fantasy sea combat, this is the game. Sometimes I want to, more often than not I prefer other things. The rules are too complicated for what they do and there is a serious problem of heavy ships being much more worth taking than small ones. The rules allow for rather cheesy maneuvers. I would prefer to use the minis for another game (yet unwritten.)

I have a lot of ships, monsters cards and the rules. Would like to sell everything, as I have no one to play with.

RATING: 8.5
This game really excels at your tactics winning the game not some uber combo power move with ship "special abilities"  It's not what you bring, it's how you play.

RATING: 8.5
Good game that has managed to keep my attention longer then most.  There seems to be a bit of a power creep with the new models.

Own: Elves - starter + 2 Dragons + 2 Assualts + 3 Destroyers
     Humans - starter + 6 Matyr Ships + 6 Destroyers
     Bone Griffons - Starter + Flag Ship + 2 H Cruisers + 6 whales
     Orks - Starter + Flagship + 2 Assualt ship + 3 destroyers

Rating is based off of initial play, splitting up two teams with 4 players.  Lots of fun, very intuitive game.  Felt the sides were well represented, and using cards for the ships and special abilities of each race was very well implemented.

Great effort by Spartan, hope it does well!

A lot of different things and very nice scoring (with 4 thematic VP-tracks grouped in pairs with only the lower ones counting). Nice theme implementation, too (with additional info sheet). Original action selection mechanism. The mask part, though in itself kinda fun, seems a bit too luck-dependent and and not so much influence and not so much interwoven with the other 3 aspects ( those other 3 are very nicely connected, though). Changing resources seems a bit too easy. Apart from those minor points, a very interesting game with a really nice feel to it. Relatively easy to get into despite its complexity. Scales well for all player counts due to different maps.
Great components and variable tribe powers are a bonus, too.

First play: Four players. Got very good impression from the rule book that this was to be a quality experience and I wasn't disappointed. The action mechanism works well with painful decisions needed at times. Echos of Mombassa and Tzolkin which can only mean good things for the game. So far the best game from Essen 2017 for me.

Provisional rating after one play. I can say I had fun playing this.

A bit of a weird mishmash of multiple area majorities and production/resource conversion. Add to this a Tic-tac-toe scheme of action selection and set collection and you have a combination that's hard to assess at first play. There's also a bit of engine building, or rather, action upgrading.

What appeared strange to me, is the random action arrangement on the 3x3 grid. Instead of planning your action combinations for future rounds, you have to make the best of what fate dictates. I guess this was done to keep the downtime low between turns, but it felt counter intuitive.

Will have to play again for a more detailed opinion. But, rating could go up.

I have the possibility to game at Wendake and I think that this is a fantastic game, with very well components and graphic! The game's mechanic is very innovative and also the game's theme is very well treated.  The first half of my first play seemed a bit overwhelming, due to there being so many options, but by the end of that same game, I felt like I had a pretty good grasp on what a better strategy for the next game would be.  I love this aspect! Best investment of 2017. Buy and game at Wendake!!! You  will not regret it!

A game with indian meeples !
It was on my radar before Essen Spiel '17, and I had a go.
I found the action selection system very well thought, so as the scoring tracks. But some aspects could have been better IMHO : the Take That mechanism, the Turn order phase, the dragging turns at the end of the game. Overall interesting !

The mechanics for tile selection & available actions is different & interesting.  Conflict is inevitable if you want points.  And the scoring tracks offer another interesting facet.  This game has elements that reminded us of a dozen other games (even tic-tac-toe!), but manages to add new twists & variations to make this a fresh game.

Fája  szívem ezért a játékért, mivel a központi mechanizmus nagyon tetszik, de sikerült annyi összefüggéstelen katyvaszt rápakolni, hogy teljesen elhomályosították a nagyszerű alapötletet. Tipikus elsőjátékos tervezésnek tűnik, amit valószínűleg évekig toldoztak-foldoztak és nem vették észre, hogy ez már réges-régen túl van tolva, és inkább vissza kellene lépni kettőt-hármat. Jó lenne, ha valaki - vagy akár ugyanez a szerző - erre az akcióválasztási mechanikára építene majd egy értelmes játékot is.

RATING: 5
Wendake is a bit of a Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde design to me. The action selection mechanism is rather neat and the basic idea for the scoring is fun, the trade-offs are agonizing enough and you can never do everything you'd like to do, but then the (fairly small) interactive part is entirely negative and can easily tilt the balance (which appears rather uneven to begin with) this way or that which quite simply makes this not my kind of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Excellent game! Sailing under the radar. Very enjoying action selection. If you can get your hand on it, buy it. One of my favorites of 2017. And i am not an usual euroish player.

On the negative: 
- It is hard to get into it. Difficult start. Give it a try, gameplay and options opens up while playing. 
- Tribes are unbalanced. Solution is simple: It's a module, don't use it.
- Solo KI not challanging

But overall the game is a 10 to me.

WENDAKE will brettspielerisch das Leben der Indianer wiedergeben. Genauer gesagt das Leben der Huronen im sieben Spielrunden dauernden Zeitabschnitt zwischen 1756 und 1763. Ein sehr ausführliches, thematisch bemühtes Beiheft, welches die Bedingungen und den Alltag der Huronen skizziert, zeugt von der liebevollen Ernsthaftigkeit des Verlags und der Autoren mit der das Spiel angegangen wurde und es immerhin zu einem soliden Eurogame verwirklicht haben, das einige gängige und einen interessanten Grundmechanismus aufweist. In einem 3x3 Raster aus Aktionsplättchen darf man pro Jahr vertikal, horizontal und diagonal seine drei Aktionssteine setzten und muss danach die Aktionsplättchen auf die Rückseite drehen. Das Ganze spielt sich gelungen, wenngleich WENDAKE jenseits davon ein paar typische Kleinverlags-Unwuchten aufweist: so sind manche Startvölker bevorteilt und auch manche Fortschrittsplättchen sind deutlich stärker als andere. Diese kleinen Kanten lassen sich aber unter Indie-Charme verbuchen. Meine persönliche Erwartung an WENDAKE war gemessen an den Rezensionslorbeeren hoch, zu hoch vielleicht. So bleibt WENDAKE eines der vielen berühmt-unberühmten Euros, die man spielen kann, aber nicht muss bevor es nun den ewigen Jagdgründen des Spielejahrgangs verschwindet.

Gioco dall'ambientazione meravigliosa: le tribù dei grandi laghi, Mondo affascinante e poco conosciuto, che rende il gioco ancora più magico di quanto ci si possa sognare.
Gli uroni, gli irochesi, gli oneida, gli algonchini, i Seneca.... un mondo meraviglioso che il gioco riesce magicamente a rievocare.
Molto apprezzati i molteplici cenni storici sulle tribù Interessate che, grazie a un evidente studio approfondito della materia, si amalgamano egregiamente nelle dinamiche del gioco. Il gioco oltre a farci conoscere bellissimi e affascinanti dettagli delle abitudini e caratteristiche di queste tribù, riesce a catapultarci incredibilmente in questo meraviglioso mondo, facendoci sentire realmente parte Degli abitanti della casa lunga.
Le meccaniche del gioco sono innovative, varie e profonde, senza però mai cadere nel macchinoso o nel ripetitivo. Un gioco molto elegante che non ha quel non so che di "già visto" che hanno moltissimi giochi degli ultimi anni. 
Nota di merito alla fase di playtest che è, evidentemente, stata fatta con meticolosità e cura. Consigliatissimo.

Very solid mid-weight euro with area control elements. The planning on your worker placement actions adds an interesting layer to the game. The dual scoring tracks are also interesting. The setup is a bit tedious but worth it once you get going.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The action selection system is the most interesting part of this game, as well as its most developed concept. 
The scoring track and available actions are just a mish-mash of mini-games which are neither entertaining nor interesting being either solitaire luck driven (Mask), solitaire (Ritual), dependant on other players (War). The fourth track (commerce) is almost mandatory for the game and usually forces the paired track to be maximized as well. 

Overall not a bad experience but maimed by excessive downtime and forced choices.

RATING: 7
FIRST IMPRESSION:

I really enjoyed the central mechanism of the 3x3 board and activating a straight row of 3 (and then removing the bottom row and flipping tiles used to the ritual side as well as acquiring a new upgraded tile via draft). Board play is very tight and conflicted. Living in peace is very challenging as you are fighting over very limited resources. With four players, there is some AP as you consider your moves and work through your upgraded tiles which often grant 2-4 actions instead of only one that your basic tiles offer. The scoring is somewhat Knizia-esque in that you are moving up three tracks and score the lowest from each pair of tracks.

After one and a half play (the half was a demo game at Spiel): Really good eurogame with a nice and somewhat new scoring mechanism,  plenty of interaction on the map, a puzzly action selection that I really like, and I like the look of the game as well.

I like the pairing of the score tracks: you can spread out your activities over all four, or focus mostly on just one pair. So far it seems both approaches can work.
The restriction that you must choose your actions on the action grid in a straight line also gives you plenty of headaches (in a good way), as you can often not do exactly what you want to do so you have to make choices.
Finally the tension between peaceful coexistence or conflict is ever-present, and your production areas are never really safe - but is an opponent willing to make extra costs to hurt your position?
Put it all together and this is a game I really like and look forward to exploring further.

Gran bel gioco! INNOVATIVO nella meccanica selezione azioni e nel sistema di punteggio, AMBIENTATO perfettamente senza far perdere giocabiblità e, dato quasi clamoroso per il genere, INTERATTIVO "diretto" (in genere l'interattività in questi giochi è sostanzialmente di tipo indiretto, cioè noioso per me :-) ).

Nota un pò stonata: le barche potrebbero essere utilizzate un pò di più, almeno sotto l'aspetto del controllo territori. 
Per esempio, valorizzando i 5 laghi singolarmente, ogni 2 barche su singolo lago si ha un +1 di appoggio militare per il controllo di un territorio adiacente e inoltre le barche possono essere mosse con l'azione movimento (probabilmente andrebbe evidenziato quali laghi appoggiano territori per ogni mappa\num giocatori).

sometimes, games are more
than boards & pieces :
 this
might be one of them

full story :
coming into the game with
high expectations, first session
was disappointing (too dry, 
too fiddly, too convoluted,
too AP inducing & too 
luck driven (masks))
so, I was ready to give it a " 4 "
& then, it came back to haunt me
(I mean : I wake up the next day
thinking about the game, the game
& its multiple parts, the game &
its evocative board, the game &
its vegetable meeples, the game
& its beavers, the game & its
feminine touch (box cover etc)

finally, for all the above reasons 
& for being one of those rare games 
when you can play " the other side " 
(like in jembo, waka waka, navajo 
wars), I decided to give it a " 10 "

dedication & diversity rewarded ...

RATING: 4
The game has four score criteria tracks that get paired at random at the start of the game. At the end of the game your actual score is your lowest in each of the two sets. One the four criteria comes from buying techs which give special ongoing abilities that you pretty much have to buy. Whichever other criteria pairs with this is mandatory to focus on. 

Generally this seems like a do everything evenly game and not a specialize game if you just look at the scoring. The game mechanisms reward specialization however which makes for a bit of a disconnect. 

The way you resolve your actions is by activating an action tile in a 3x3 grid on your board. All further turns you have to activate tiles so that by the end of three turns you've made a straight line across your board. The tiles can have multiple effects as the game goes on adding to the long downtime between turns. At the end of the round the tiles you used flip over and become an uninspired rest action that give you rest track points based on how many guys are uselessly sitting at home. Then you push out the bottom 3 tiles, choose one to stop using, then choose a new one from a fliplucky display; shuffle it with your 2 and put them at the top of your grid. 

There's a lot of downtime as players AP their tile choice since each tile can do several things and the combinations appear unique.

Generally your actions produce goods from the board, which you need different sets of to get the technology tiles. Your ability to produce goods depends on how hard other players punch you. When a player gets movement points they can move their soldiers around the board. The soldiers can then stand guard, or they can lay down on an empty space becoming a production spot, or they can punch someone out of a production spot unless that spot is guarded. If the opponent has a guard then your attackers and the guards die uselessly for both players at a 1:1 ratio. This means the game isn't punchy at all until all the spaces fill up then suddenly it's super punchy. Attacking is pretty much universally bad, and in our game players did it more because they were out of new guys to spawn and or they had movement points they didn't have a way to usefully spend, than out of some sense of punching the leader. 

So track 1 is get techs. Everyone does that. Track 2 is have the most military in x spots; this is very dependant on not getting punched. Track 3 is take the rest action and don't have guys on the board, which is super uncompelling but something the game expects you to do. Track 4 is a tacked on flip luck driven set collection card thing.

The game also comes with variable player powers that are pretty minor overall. It all works out to feel like a similar game to; but not nearly as good as scythe? The downtime with 4 players is unbearable. I wound up falling into a dumb trap of activating tiles in a straight line horizontally, which meant that before long I had my three actions that did things on the top row, and then below that two rows of all rest actions. I really thought I'd like this a lot more, but I have to say it's a pass for me.

I backed this game on Kickstarter. It arrived incomplete. I reported to Post Scriptum that I was missing 1 red cylinder and all 20 colored tribe discs back on Dec 6, 2017, which was more than 2 months ago. I still have not received the missing components. Without those components, the game is unplayable so I have given Wendake the lowest rating of 1 because BGG will not allow me to rate it a zero, which is what it deserves.

One of the most thematically rich experiences in board games today. All the actions make sense; the win conditions make sense; rituals make sense; movement makes sense.

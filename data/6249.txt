Maybe it was the group I played with, but I got bored. Folks silently took their turns, buying tiles...or not buying tiles.  We added up points a few times.  Really not much to do when it is not your turn. I was happy when it was over, but, I'd be willing to play it again, so maybe my opinion will change.

An intellectual exercise.  Not overly fun.

Edit: That review was from about five years ago.  Played it again and found it much lighter and more enjoyable.
Maybe it was the group I was playing with....

Played more times and the more I play the more I like it. However, played with six and it was awful. Half the game in more time. I'd never play it with six again and it makes me think five is questionable.

Accidentally played this the same day as Splendor. They are very similar games. Sit in silence doing math while you build your own engine, taking a peek every now and then to see what the opponents are doing.

Very dry and nonsociable; not what i want from boardgames.

First impression: Enjoyed our game. It has that light weight Euro issue where the bounces can go against you but the game is long enough to mitigate that aspect. It might actually last a little too long or at least for what is comfortable for the light weight nature. Regardless it is enjoyable for what it is. Another plus is the ease to get the base game to the table. Just as comparison Kingdom Builder is more fiddly, (but probably a better game). 1st rating, 7.

2nd impression: Second play was a family game and up'd the rating to 8. This is a very good family game. It went over well. Same kind of feeling as early plays of TTR honeymoon period. I also feel i'm ready to add some of the expansions that I have.

Sort of a mixture of carcassonne and settlers, but not living up to either. Artwork is nothing special, competition is incidental for the most part. Gets boring if you play it too often.

RATING: 6.5
Ehh.  It is a fine economic/pseudo-worker placement game.  Not very exciting, and can be a bit skewed based on the value of tiles that come out.  I haven't played with any of the expansions, so perhaps they spice things up.

RATING: 6.5
A tile-laying/building game with set collection and a "push your luck" aspect.

Each turn you can pick up money, or purchase a tile (specific types of money required),  and hopefully add it to your alhambra or modify your alhambra.  The bonus is that if you pay exact cash, you get another turn, of course if you overpay, you don't even get change back.

Scoring is through majorities in types of building tiles, as well as for each consecutive wall you have on your alhambra.  The "push your luck" comes into play as there are 2 somewhat random scoring cards placed in the deck, and as soon as they appear, you stop everything and score...so do you dare to keep taking money, or do you "waste" that turn modifying your alhambra hoping to put that extra building tile in before the scoring phase?

This game plays 2-6, but realistically, I wouldn't play it with more than 3.  It's actually perfect as a light strategy game for 2-3 players, but above that it gets too random and chaotic.  Luck of the draw with the tiles and money is a factor, but there's enough strategy to overcome this for the most part.  Definitely a good buy if you like tile-layers, and want something different than say Carcassonne.

Own all of the expansions ([boardgame=45358]big box[/boardgame]: [boardgame=9687]Vizier's Favor[/boardgame], [boardgame=13287]City Gates[/boardgame], [boardgame=16494]Thief's Turn[/boardgame], [boardgame=22279]Treasure Chamber[/boardgame], [boardgame=39109]Power of the Sultan[/boardgame]), including the [boardgame=142420]Falconers[/boardgame].

I play it a lot (simple game but very interesting and dynamic) My moms favourite game!

I was in Alhambra in Spain 15 years ago, its reall a very beautiful place with really mind blowing gardens and wells. Therefore I had to have this game! 

It reminds me of Zooloretto, however its more friendly than Zooloretto as the offer comes back every time and not like in Zooloretto where you can screw people around. Also its more complex to Zooloretto. 

In enjoyment its right there in the middle with Catan and Carcassonne which is a great addition. In comparison to Carcassonne and Catan, this game is more friendly as you dont mess around with other players as much as in the other two games

Its acctually a nice family game that is interesting to play, its not cooperative, but still is pretty friendly

A drafting game with majority scoring.  There is a lot of turn over in the cards and tiles you draft.  Arranging the tiles and managing your cards is also important.  Often times it feels like the game plays you--a common trend in Henn designed games.  Like 7 Wonders it you are mainly playing against the people to your immediate right and left.

Enjoyed my initial plays of this, but bored of it now. Competition between players hurts your position and should be avoided. Money cards and building tiles feel especially lucky and buildings get snatched up right before your turn, so you can't do any planning until it's your turn. Lots of downtime.

Excellent game, fun and plays fairly quick.  Seems balanced with a bit of luck thrown in, but some good solid strategy as well.  A winner for sure!!  

This game I go back and forth on I guess.  I love it some days, hate it others, just like it on a few.  Why?  Sometimes the randomness gets annoying.  Dropping my rating to a 7 and letting it rest for awhile.

Further note, more than 4 and the rating for this game drops to like a 5.  At which point you MUST have Vizier's Favor expansion, then it becomes an 7 to me.  Otherwise, 5 or 6 is just a tad too chaotic.

Hmm...there's a lot of both positive and negative things to say about this game, but by and large the positives hold sway.

Positives: it's easy to learn and play, it's attractive to look at and well put together component-wise (as are most Queen games), you can buy lots of variants, it moves along quite quickly with 2, 3 or 4 players, there's a plenty of strategy, a degree of luck to stop it getting stale, the theme and play is quite relaxing which makes for a pleasant evening, you can plan ahead but not so much that it dreis the game up.
Negatives: there's not much player interaction (though beacuse it's light there is a fair bit of heckling and social interplay), some might find that there's too much luck (particularly if someone keeps managing to get two actions by paying the correct cash), if you get a bit boxed in it can be hard to sort that out (but then again good play should mitigate against doing that).

It is somewhat reminiscent of Princes of Florence, but I prefer it to that game as this is less dry and more fun.  The lack of interaction is about the same, but this just seems more of a pleasant way to spend an hour.  It's definitely lighter than PoF, but then again if I want a heavy or heavy medium game, I'd never pick PoF anyway, so in that sense there isn't such a direct comparison - I might well pick Alhambra when a light-medium game is required.

An interesting game.  The use of the money cards is particularly of note since you get a bonus action (which is pretty valuable) when you spend the exact amount to purchase a structure.  An artificial construct to be sure, but it makes the game infinitely more interesting and provokes more complicated choices.

Even so, seems like there is a fair amount of randomness.  Granted I played a 5 player game which I'm told is more random than one with fewer players, but it just felt overly random.  I think I spent too much purchasing high-cost structures and was unable to purchase as many as I needed.  I'm not sure if that speaks to my lack of experience or the wide range of costs the different buildings have.

An okay game, in my opinion.  I'm glad I got to play it, but it really didn't strike a cord with me.  There aren't any notable mechanics or combinations.  It felt very random.  It also felt like I was perpetually behind because I purchased too many high-cost buildings.  And once you're behind, forget it.  There's no catch up mechanism, or at least no great way to make up the lost ground, particularly as you cannot affect anyone else directly.

I would play this again, but it's not high up on my To Do list.

5/21/10:  I played a 4-player game and enjoyed it.  I'm not quite sure how, but I managed to get a nice wall going and I rode that to victory.  I would definitely play this again.  Rating bumped from 5 to 6.

We simply don't enjoy this very much, though we've only played a few times (because we don't enjoy it).  As others have noted it feels like "the game plays you."  Not deep, not fun.

For a moment, when we dragged this out after a long break I thought this might be "ok."  Then the next game I got the "endless stream of pure luck exact change" early in the game that fuels a luck-driven runaway leader problem that makes an already so-so game really not any good at all.

After 1 to 5 plays

I know "Alhambra" is one of the greatest games the market offers and it's part of the "Pantheon" of classic boardgames, but for me it's been really hard to put pressure on my friends and convince them to play. The main problem is the unattractive game box (and in general, the game design) that makes it look like kinda boring. I can assure you it's not what it might seem at first sight. The mechanics are great and after the first game everybody was amazed. We're going to play it more often, even if introductory games are not our favourite genre. Hope to be recording new plays very soon!

Very clever way of using different currencies to make it more than just a simple tile laying-game. Very good and fast.

RATING: 7
Lay tiles to make the best city. Four building tiles are available at any one time, but each of them can only be bought using one of the four coloured currencies in the card deck.

Will you have the right money to buy the buildings you need? Or will others swipe them from under your nose?

Trade Info: Excellent Condition. Trading because it never gets played

Alhambra is one of my favorite games yet! The rules are easy to learn and it's intuitive to play. 

However, the point scoring for ties is overly complicated. During the first scoring round, each type of building is scored for the player with the most buildings (of that type). During the scoring round, if there is a tie, then the points are divided among contesting players (rounded down, if necessary). 

The rules are not clear on how to score points if 2 players tie for first place and there are points available for a 2nd or 3rd place finishing. Here's how it's supposed to be handled, according to BGG: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/88797 and http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/32222. I'd prefer that tie scoring is handled like El Grande - if 2 players are tied for first, then the points are split, and then the next placed player gets the points for third place (if applicable). 

Tracked on family list (grooven)! Maybe pick up the deluxe edition?

Wasn't convinced on first play, however, my wife liked it, so I bought it. I'm glad I did, it got played quite a few times and will hit the table once in a while, with newer gamers.

RATING: 7
Good tile placement game that works well with gamers or nongamers. Easy and quick to explain and plays fairly quickly. More chaotic game with 4 or more since the buildings change more frequently. Makes it difficult to manage your money and becomes more frustrating as a result. Also, not as approachable a game as some of the games in the Carcassonne family and therefore doesn't serve as a good game for nongamers.

Juego sencillo, bonito, para jugar con niños o con la familia. Se trata de ir comprando losetas para formar nuestra alhambra, hay varios tipos de moneda en forma de cartas que se va robando. Muy simple y con mucho azar, poco estratégico, pero por otro lado es divertidillo y  bastante relajante para momentos en los que no se tiene la cabeza para mucho pensar...

Awesome game, wouldn't have thought the score board needed to go that high, but game scores quickly skyrocket.  Fun game to plan ahead or prevent your neighbor from doing so.  Many options to plan for so not stuck in a tunnel.  Group loved it, quick to learn.

I just recently started recording my plays, so the actual play count of this is highly inaccurate. Alhambra was one of the first games I bought along with Carcassonne and Settlers.

I've gone through a few stages with this game. At first, I liked it. Played it with more than 4 people and started to dislike it. It saw the table less and less with the longest time between plays probably clocking in at two months. I pulled it out when my girlfriend was visiting and we tried the two player variant after playing a couple of games of Race for the Galaxy and Ingenious. I fell in love again. Part of the problem with this game is the sweet spot is probably around 3 or 4. With that number of players the planning and decisions come back to the game. With anymore the game is too chaotic and it feels like luck if you are able to buy something on your turn that you need.

Definitely worth it with 4 or less. I'll pass with any more players though.

After my first play years ago it became my favorite. I've played many many games since, newer and older, but this has stayed at the top. Simple, not too complex, easy to teach and learn, and while there is not much player interaction there is still tension (looking around the table, seeing what people have, getting angry when someone snags a piece you wanted to buy but it's not your turn..) Every time I teach someone they have loved it. Have never had a bad time playing this game. That is why I give it a wholehearted 10 out of 10.
Update: Ever since I've recently played Santorini and TIMR Stories, those have taken the number 1&2 spot of my games. Still, this one is very fun, and I still enjoy it.

Grab cards ASAP or buy piles and build your city. Family game. Boring after a dozen plays or more. Lots of luck.  Played with 3. There are many piles on the "buyable-piles-board" that dont fit well with the rest of the piles and hurt the flow of the game (especially the piles with 3 walls) (thats why Id rather play Carcassonne). Probably best with 4 players like so many other games. Wouldnt want to play with 2 or 6 players.

Interesting, if a bit light. I like the tile laying here better than in Carcassonne, if this is a bit less interactive. There is a bit of luck in the tile draws and the card flips, but I don't find it too troublesome. A nice balance of scoring between an open Alhambra (majority for tile types) and a closed Alhambra (the wall).

Curious about some of the expansions ... (I didn't get Big Box).

Mediocre tile placement game. Supports up to 6 players but the fewer, the better. Easy to teach and play. Gameplay is totally random since you start with random money in random colours and you try to buy random buildings tiles with random costs and random colours and score points at random times (it even rewards lucky players with an extra turn if they have precise the money required for a building) and it gets even more chaotic with more players. Kinda like Carcassone in this aspect. I like the components. I suppose its a nice game for casual players who just want to pass their time chatting around when it is not their turn.

Alhambra is really good. One thing to know in this game is not to look at the board when it isn't your turn. Those tiles you wanted so badly wont be there when it's your turn to buy them.

The ultimate gateway game. It doesn't get any more fun or simple  than this. Three simple actions each turn. Take cash from the bank, buy a building for your Alhmabra or rearrange buildings already in your Alhambra. That's it. But there is a good amount of strategy in this game mixed with the luck of the card draws from the bank. Heavy Eurogamers might think this is too simple and they are probably right. But it is still so much fun. This game ties Ticket to Ride for our favorite gateway game. It is that good.

{1 play • 4 players} Okay, first off, I LOVE Stimmt So.  I've always enjoyed the simplicity of it and never felt like it needed any improvement.  Secondly, I made some early wall-placement mistakes which kind of screwed me for the rest of the game.  So I was already wary of this one, then messed up my first experience right from the get-go.  But, grain of salt not withstanding, I'm not sure my rating will go much higher after future plays, as I really think the walls take away from the beauty of the "stock market" system.  Plus they slow the game down.  I'll play it again, but I think you've all vastly overrated this one.

Wretched excuse for a game.  It's completely luck-driven.  This is based on a 5-player game, and I can understand how it might play better with 2 or 3.  But if a game is advertised as "2-6 players," the play should at least be decent with 5.

Good light gateway game that plays well at all player counts. Making efficient moves by paying with exact change and buying tiles that continue your longest contiguous wall but don't close you off go a long way towards victory. There's a bit of press your luck in the game as you hope to get something built before the randomly timed scoring cards appear.

redesigning your alhambra is slow suicide to the point that the option seems to need fixing.  other than that the game is good, if a little long.  great feeling of development during play.  2-player variant with a dummy non-player is surprisingly good.  i normally hate that.  i also like 3-player a lot, but probably wouldn't be into it with 4.  never hits the table, although i'd like it to.

A sound design, but too much luck in the cards AND in the types of building that come up for auction.  Most strategic choices (like saving cards for a specific tile or placing your buildings in a specific formation to capitalize on wall connections) don't feel like they carry any "weight," and are usually nullified as you watch an opponent grab an important tile before your turn comes around.  The endgame also seems to drag on forever.  It is a good introductory game, and the components are terrific, but I doubt this game will be played with any frequency.

A quite good game that I sense could have been much better, were it not for the very high luck element.

UPDATE: I'm liking this one better lately. It does have a huge luck factor in the tiles available (and especially the moment they become available), but there's something undeniably fun in the race for getting the most of a type of tile. or the most walls. Up to a 7, although it's highly unlikely it will ever rise from there.

UPDATE: Too chaotic for what it pretends to be. Down a notch to a 6.

Az egyik elsőként vásárolt saját játékom (Az Attila, a Catan, a Carcassone és a Metro után). A beépíthetőségre és a színekre is figyelni nem is olyan egyszerű, de szerencsére egy-egy rossz döntés is javítható később. Gördülékeny a játékmenet, 2 és 3 fővel is jó kis könnyed játék. A szerencse szerepe nem kicsi, ennek ellenére nekem bejött! 
---
Kipróbáltam egyszerre az első 4 kieggel, és így egész komplex volt a játék! A szerencse szerepe a sok új elemmel még nagyobb, és bár összességében nem rossz, de a kevesebb néha több: a 4 kieg 16 komponenséből a legjobb 4-5-öt kiválasztva egy ütős és pörgős játékot kaphatunk szerintem, így minden együtt kicsit vontatott, van pár gyengén sikerült dolog azért, amik csak sallangok. Ezzel együtt megérte kipróbálni a kiegeket!

We played once a base version and once with the City Gates expansion. It took me 5 minutes to teach my friends how to play and we really had a lot of fun! This game gives just enough options to be occupied and make hard decisions, but without overexercising your brain. Take into account that I really like difficult and heavy games like Brass or Caylus, and Alhambra was a very nice surprise to me.

EDIT: we played again with inexperienced players. They learned fast (rules are very easy to understand) and we all had a lot of fun. Thus, grade goes up by 1, for what this game is meant to be it is almost perfect.

After one play, I was pleasant surprised by how easy the rules were to become acquainted with.  The strategies to the game are clear and you're provided with many choices along the way as to your best route.  There is good reason this is often found in the "spouse" geeklists, because it is indeed perfect for that.  The included 2-person rules work great and I am looking forward to more plays in the future.  I expect the rating to rise with those more plays.

A card-based tile buying/playing game.  The system of buying/placing works pretty well, with a decent scoring mechanism for most, second-most, etc, along with wall length.

Alhambra wasn't a great "Spiel des Jahres". It misses something to become a topgame. When you aren't lucky with the right money to buy tiles you never get far. When somebody is lucky that the sum is a few times right, even with a good strategy you can't win against such advantage.

I have enjoyed each and every playing of Alhambra.  It has become my first dime of 2005 and will only get more and more playings thoughout the year.   I have played multiple games with 2, 3, and 4 players and feel that it scales extremely well.

Alhambra is a game that offers hand management, city building, tile laying and tough choices throughout.  The "invisible" scoring rounds make for difficult decisions when you start getting close.  "Do I take the money, buy another house or should I move this off my reserve to try and score some points?" "Should I buy a garden that will score me immediate points or a tower that could pay off in the long run?"  "Hmmm...  should I buy the piece to extend my wall or to extend my city?"

I feel that it is themed well and if introduced properly, one can bring the players into the games thematic and playing depths very easily.  It is also very easy to learn and play, while leaving many decisions to allow a certain complexity.  I understand why it won Game of the Year over Puerto Rico, I find it to be a much more accessible game.

The game is attractive but interaction among the players is indirect, similar to Puerto Rico.

The more I play this offering, the better I like it.  It never seems as if you have enough cash to keep up with your competitors, and carefully considering how to expand your wall to receive those last valuable points is always a juggling act.  This is a very accessible game.  I've taught it to my hard core gaming group where is was well received, as well as to random couples who have visited and were talked into playing a game.  No one had complained, and all have mentioned that they have enjoyed the experience.  Now comes the tough part...formulating the best strategy with the cash and tiles that are available.  [Gift]

A few expansions really perk the game up - the "City Gates" expansion box has three great additions (Diamonds, Camps and City Gates). The expansion with the Vizier's favour is a good addition when playing with 4+.

A decent family game, but as far as this type of game goes, there are far more interesting ones out there.  I may actually re-acquire this game at some point because my family loves it and there are so many expansions available.  Maybe they will breath new life into a game I've long since abandoned.

A great gateway game that rivals Ticket to Ride. It has the card drawing similar to Ticket to Ride and then a some spatial aspects a little like Carcassonne. The anniversary edition with the board is a much better display, but the normal game is still very good. There are some additional expansions that improve on the game if you are interested. Enough randomness that allows new players to compete with experienced ones.

There is little to no ability to plan in a 5 player game as any tile or money you want will be gone by your turn. Add on that you can't predict who wants what tiles or be bothered keeping count of each color.

Nice game, harder with 6 players! Worth playing but not owning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First Play. A light OK filler where the control diminishes as more players join in. A bit too random for my liking. The tiles and cards can either fall in your lap with the numbers, colours and wall configurations working for you or against. Hope and blind luck can play an important part in a strategy paying off and adding a serious chunk of points at the end..

As you really don't know whats going to be available on your turn there is a strong solo element to the game.

Not a game I'd rush to play again and I'm happy to have sold it on.

Not bad, but there's definitely luck as to when the different colored currencies come out and at what amounts, and of course when the tiles come out and where they wind up being placed.

since I like tile games I purchased this on a whim a just played my first game with 6...I took 5th place but now understand the mechanics behind it.

Just played a second time with 4 and had a blast, each player had a huge Alhambra...still working out my strategy though.

Alhambra is a nice game, low on the player interaction.  Non-gamers like the tiles (and I do, too!), the colors, and the very simple play which still offers scope for tactical moves.  Putting together your own Alhambra seems to be a definite winner, and the two-player option is actually very good, which is always a plus.

Great game!  I liked that each player is building up their own palace kind of like a puzzle.  It's really great as a 2 player game.  I played also with 3 players and it was a bit longer.  It says you can play with up to 6 players but I'm curious to know how the play is and if the analysis time goes down with more players (as they would have more time between turns) or if it goes up.  I can't wait to check out some of the expansions but I'm really happy with the original version right now.

I was so lost in this game, what kind of strategy to go for, so much going on and so deceivingly light seeming game. Didn't like very much on the first try, but might change my opinion on more plays. I can see why people play this over-and-over again, so much depth but not easy to grasp.

Using four types of currency players purchase tiles and create an Alhambra scoring points at three differnt points during the game based on the number of tiles of each color relative to the other players plus a point for each link in your longest contiguous outer wall.

A nice tile placing game. You have to create the best palace (Alhambra) using money to buy the tile, and placing them, starting from your fountain. The game are a mix of strategy and lucky, you have to look for the color of tile you buy, to conquer the majority of some colour during the Victory Point check, to achieve more Vp of other player. A good game in 2, but best played in 6.

Simple yet very strategic.  I love how you want to do so many different things on your turn, but usually only can afford to do 1 or 2.  Sometimes it can seem to be a bit dull as you sit there building up a hand of cash, but when the right combo of tiles come up you can have a really massive turn.  And it almost seems that there are no bad options since you can use just about any tile to help you or block your opponents.

The 3 separate scoring rounds offers a nice building tension, as things start out small and then build exponentially.  It also makes it hard to predict who is really winning until that final scoring is completed.  Looks like there's some nice potential for the expansions as well.

Alhambra reminds me a lot of Carcasonne where you use the tiles to build your city. Compared to Carcasonne, Alhambra doesn't allow others to mess up your carefully laid tiles to share points. In Alhambra, it's all up to chance and the decisions you make to win the game.

I am normally not enthralled with tile building, but Alhambra does the concept correctly by combining an interesting building mechanism with an equally interesting purchasing mechanism.  Top it off with a scoring system that forces you to choose proactively again your opposition, and you end up with a game that has a lot of good mechanics working well together.  Plays great with 2 or more.

Three plays (2-p, 3-p, 4-p).

Not directly confrontational, so seems very soothing to me. The luck doesn't bother me too much, as you can mitigate it somewhat by taking "good" money cards.

First 2-p game was more fun than I thought it was going to be...Dirk was a bastard!

Crept up 1/2 a mark to 7.

One thing is for sure: Alhambra is an easy («middling» would be more proper) game, both to understand and to play. It rewards the more thoughtful players, the ones who know their strategy as soon as they see the first tiles available and the money cards they’ve drawn: besides this, there’s very little about the game, whose only feeling is it’s trying to capitalize on Carcassonne’s hype while adding an useless auction-like mechanics.

I was very disappointed with this one the first time I played it, but it's grown on me. I've played it with 2, 3, and 4. I'm guessing that with more players, the downtime between turns would start to get annoying. For two-player variants, I usually hate having to play a fake third player (that's *not* a 2-player game!), but this one's not bad; you can just ignore it except for scoring.

[Hadn't played this in a while. It's much better than I've been giving it credit for and not necessarily as light as I think of it as being. I really do enjoy it. It's different from anything else I have. Raising my rating. The 2-player game's really good.]

I really like the base system. The walls for the tiles, and the added spacial considerations correct what I saw as an issue with the game this was based on: Stimmt So! The issue was that the strategy of simply buying anything that you could that was exact change was the best strategy. But, it added a bit of an issue in that the remodel action seems weak. The expansions have fixed that in multiple ways. (Change, Architect, stuff that works best in particular configurations, etc.) Good stuff.

I like this game more than I expected. There is more going on than at first appears. A lot can go into the decisions when buying tiles. Is it a color I need to move me ahead of someone else? Can I pay the exact amount and get another turn? How does it fit in with other tiles and the wall?The two-player game works well with the dummy player. I enjoy the game with all numbers, but prefer playing with two or three players. The fewer players allow you to plan somewhat for you next because some tiles and currency cards will still be on the board when your next turn arrives. With more players you react more to what is available on your turn.

// I like Alhambra quite a bit with the right group. It's
neat acquiring the right tiles and watching your city take
shape. This game is pretty weak in 2-player mode, though,
which is how we play most of our games. The app has kind of
replaced the physical game for me since it lets me scratch
the itch without needing to have a bigger group of people
around to play it with.

Played this on Spellenspektakel 2003 in Eindhoven (Holland).  It didn't appeal that much to me but I think it might has more potential than I noticed.  We didn't play till the end and the one from Queen games explaining the game was not very gifted doing so.  One day I might give this one a second chance.

RATING: 6.5
Great for diehard & casual gamers alike.  Alhambra does not have dice or action cards, but there's enough luck and short-term strategy in the tiles (buildings) & cards (money).   Player interaction in Alhambra consists of observing what other players are collecting, building, etc. and trying to throw a monkey wrench in their plans and/or helping your own position.  This can lead to tough decisions, but the game tends to move quite quickly.  It's fun to watch players walling off areas to score wall points and then trying to figure out how to build more buildings.  The 2-player option for Alhambra is decent, and my casual gamer friends love the game.  ** UPDATE 2008 ** The game suffers a bit with 5-6 players since there are fewer tiles and turns per player and luck plays a bigger role.  I think over-paying is a much more viable tactic with 5-6 players (as opposed to only buying with exact money and getting a rainbow with bad walls).

This is a fun game that has familiar mechanisms of play but has enough variation to make it unique.  In fairness, it is an older game to the one I would most compare it too which is Ticket to Ride (card taking to buy tiles {trains} and turns that comprise a single action out of multiple choices.  Tile placing as opposed to route building.  We really like the scoring system where you only score points at specific times in the game that is random enough to keep a tenseness to game play as you need to be careful what tiles you haven't played to your Alhambra as it can cost you points.  The 2 player rules are well thought out and makes the game fun with any number of players.

Interest in this game has increased.  Played a 2p with my daughter recently and really liked it.
***
With more than 3p it's too tactical for any sort of long-term strategy.  Way too much randomness to take seriously.  Just wait until your turn comes up and take whatever is the best move at the time.  With 2 or 3 it's much better.   

Still, you need to be aware of the types and number of buildings your opponents have, and plan accordingly on your turn.

I have relegated it to a gateway game and will only bring it out when people new to hobby are around.

Fun game that involves resource management.  It also feels very auctiony.  You experience resource anxiety when another player scopes out a particular coin that maybe your saving.

The goals is to aquire various garen plots and construct a vast garden that has certain point garnering qualities.

There is basically resource aquisition that can occur with each turn and then also there is purchasing of a garden tile.  There is usually aquisition of one or there can be both.  There are 3 scoring opportunities in each game and the better you plan for them the more points you gain.

I played Stimmt So many times before Alhambra and to be honest I don't think Alhambra adds any net value for me. The entire wall building and Alhambra building addition to the basic Stimmt So mechanics seems only to my mind to exacerbate the sheer luck that surrounds the purchasing mechanism.

I'm not sure which I prefer but presently lean in favour of Stimmts So simply because it's simpler with much the same buying and set collecting mechanism and less of complexity hanging from the haphazard buying mechanism. 

At least that's the way it struck me playing with many players. With 2 it may be very different. But with 5 Alhambra is one of those games that leave me free to wander teh games room and chat with other people between my moves because frankly it add the frustrating multiplayer solitaire aspect of the present fashion (think Puerto Rick, Princes of Florence and their ilk) to a buying mechanism that changes so much over the course of 4 intervening players even looking at it after playing is bordering on pointless, I can sit and play my move just as effectively and quickly when it arrives, and move off again to socialize before I have to move again. 

Frankly this whole fashion of little solitaire like constructions on independent boards coupled with mildly interactive resource acquisition mechanisma is of little interest to me and even elss so when the mildly interactive resource acquisition mechanisma vary so much between you turns what goes on there is pretty moot.The most you'd get out of sitting around while others move is maybe biasing your competitive strategy and choice of sets to collect, but frankly a glance around the table just before moving provides the same input.

My wife enjoys this (big plus!).  A fun game that is not too long, but more of a long filler than a main event.

Update: played 3 times with my wife's family over Thanksgiving.  This was a hit!  I did not expect it to be as well received as it was, especially as a 6 player game, but they all liked it.  I think the fact that turns go by quickly, and that each individual turn is a single decision were both selling points.  The game is still not simple, but neither is it a real thinking game.  There's enough to keep them engaged without overloading.  This is a group that likes to say "I don't want to think while I play a game".  Ah, well - you work with what you have.

As a 6 player game, Alhambra offers relatively little control, because the tiles on offer change quite a bit between your turns.  This makes it a very tactical game, although there is still a layer of strategy in choosing who you will compete for colors with (hint: the person on your left is a good choice).  Most (all) colors will have multiple players buying them.  To some extent, this means that the order in which the tiles and money come out will confer an advantage to some players.  However, I think that in most games, this advantage will not be terribly significant as it will tend to average out over the game.  The player who chooses the right tiles to buy, and the correct timing on hoarding cash verses spending has a greater advantage than that conferred by luck of the draw.  

Overall, this is a light game that, when played quickly, offers a nice experience that doesn't overstay its welcome.  It plays 6, and my wife's family likes it.  That earns it a place in my game closet, even if it's not a personal favorite.

Se trata de construir una "Alhambra" de tal manera que puntúes más que tus contrincantes. El azar viene marcado por el uso del dinero y la aparición de las fichas de construcción. A mi juicio, ese azar evita la planificación. La estrategia va dirigida a adaptarse a lo que te va llegando y van haciendo tus contrincantes.

Visually appealling; works very well as a gateway game.  I used to like it a lot more but got a little burned out on it after a couple dozen games.  Can be frustrating if the tiles and money cards you need aren't coming up, but that's often balanced out by a super-sweet turn in which you turn a handful of cards into the exact tiles you need.  2-player game is not the most elegant, but it does work.  3p is the sweet spot.

I can easily see this staying an 8 in rating with the immediate interest in the game by all. Has enough strategy that it is challenging, just enough choices to make it interesting but not too daunting, and nice looking tiles to make it attractive. Great for family, but would play this with a gaming group any time. This general appeal is evident at BGG.CON, where an Alhambra Tournament has been offered with many signing up. The element that seems to "seperate the men from the boys" is building the Alhambra walls to maximize scoring. UPDATE: This game has more appeal with the angst offered with set collecting or grabbing valuable currency. Love it.

So far I've only played it two player...

I love the simplicity of the rules (do 1 of three actions), but how with the exact change element you can chain multiple actions on 1 turn.

The overall visual design is really great for getting a feel for where everyone's at and where you'll stand if a scoring card comes up. This could have been a pain, but they did a great job.

I also love the spatial element to this and that it doesn't overstay its welcome. 

My biggest complaint is it is a little drab looking and that the building names (I imagine in order to be language independent) are things like ** or *****. Granted they are different colors, but a little more theme in the building names would have made this a little more immersive and engaging

I like this one -- it's like a combination of Carcassone and Goa, but more fun than either.  The interaction isn't heavy with a lot of players though, unless you allow out-of-turn purchases (as per one of the expansions, not sure which one).  One of the regular group bought this game fairly recently, and my appreciation has only increased with each play since.

It is easy to overlook the strategic value of Alhambra (such as the need to purchase only the tiles you require / need to prevent others from acquiring, and how you arrange your own tiles) - but it's the strategic value that breathes life into an otherwise peaceful game.

Of particular note, the iconography of currency / constructions in Alhambra (like Ticket to Ride) accommodates those with a colour vision deficiency.

RATING: 8
Update July 2010:  Got to play this a couple times this month, for the first time in almost 2 years.  Easy to see why it won the SdJ, though in the 4-player game I played, the other three players didn't like it much.  They were frustrated about the placement restrictions, and the fact that I won in a landslide.  One of the challenges people have is visualizing how the tiles will fit in their Alhambra when the tiles are on the central board, and not the "right way up" to them.  So they were constantly rotating those tiles on the board to see how they would look.  Maybe the solution is for the tiles on the board to always be placed the same way, and for people to organize their Alhambras with the same way being "up" for everyone?  Don't know.  But I want to play this game more.


I like this better than the other multi-currency games I've played, Palazzo & Tower of Babel.  A bit more going on and more interesting tactical tile-laying element.  Definitely want to play this more.

Not a bad game, but somehow I find it rather annoying. When you "never" get to purchase a tile for the exact amount of money, "never" get to draw multiple money cards, "never" find the tile that fits your wall, and "always" end up tied for the points - of course all this cannot be happening all the time, but it seems like this game makes everybody complain. You have limited control and the sweet spots in this game are too small (rare).

Good game and enjoyable to play.  I like some of the simplicity in tis, my only concern is with the possibility that players who manage to get the right currencies to get the Towers and Gardens will tend to thump the other players.

Not a bad game, there are just others I would prefer to play.

This is great game to play with non-board game people. It has enough strategy and planning to keep things interesting, while not intense enough to be intimidating. The limited options that each player is faced with during their turn keeps the game moving along as well as limits the stress. This is that perfect middle ground game for those that want to relax and those that want to exercise some strategy. I enjoy it every time and it will likely continue to stay in my top ten.

One of my most played games. I´ve lost the account of times this game has occupied my table since I got it, more than ten years ago. Alhambra is one of the first eurogames and contributed to denominate them. The basic game is an all time classic, and wins a lot of complexity and fun with its expansions.

Good with two, great with three, loses a lot with four, and I wouldn't even bother trying five or six.  The rating of a 8 is for the 3 player game.  Two players I'd rate a 6, four a 5, and five or six players a 4.  The first edition Uberplay rules have incorrect wall scoring!!

Have Alhambra big box now.  If 4 players will try to add a few of the expansions that allow interupt buys and things like that.

RATING: 5
Alhambra is a decent game.  For some reason it took us forever to get it, but I found the Jubilee edition for a great price ($28) so I snagged it.  The game is all elegant simplicity combined with some wicked competition.  I can see why this won Spiel de Jahres - simple to learn, a bit of luck, and pretty to look at.  With 2, however, it does suffer.  Dirk works fine as the dummy - although he is random.  My big problem is with the scoring, as it is usually just not that tense.  Since your control over gaining certain tiles is pretty limited, often one player manages to snag the more valuable groups, so runaway leader is very possible.  In most of our games, scoring is not close.  This is a game I'll play with 2 to humor others, but it's not my favorite.

Stimmt So! with some pointless junk added in. Stimmt So! was a non-threatening, if not exactly inspiring, game which I really don&#039;t ever have any desire to play and nobody else ever suggests it, so it&#039;s not exactly going great guns around here. Alhambra gets it out onto the table again by the virtues of a) being new and b) looking good, but since it really didn&#039;t add anything interesting and in fact have subtracted by addition, I expect it to share Stimmt So!&#039;s fate.

RATING: 8
Essentially, in Alhambra you're taking turns to either get money, or spend that money on tiles to build your Alhambra.  Every so often, players will score points based on their Alhambra, scoring points for majorities in different types of rooms as well as the wall sections surrounding the buildings.  So, you must keep an eye on what other players are doing while building in order to maximize your points.

Overall, Alhambra is a very simple game suitable for playing with the family, but is definitely still interesting for gamers as well.  It definitely hits a sweet spot there!

Rating is for a three player game.  My rating goes down 1 point for each player added to the game, since there is quite a bit of luck/randomness with too many players.

Well how did it take me so long to play this lovely wee thing? As much as I played a lot of hotness this month, and not so tapped goodies, I also played some classics that I am LATE to the show on. It was easy to pick up and it was easy to get stomped on. Just made me want to come back for more. This will be on my first big order of April or May I think. I could play this with just about any of my game groups. And then with the expansions in that Big Box of Goodness, it should stay fresh for a while.

For me, the currency system is what makes this game. Dealing with four different currencies and trying to pay in only exact costs to get those extra turns makes for a really interesting money management game - albeit one that's played more turn-to-turn rather than as a longterm strategy. This turns an otherwise straightforward tile laying game into something unique and memorable.

I rarely play this one, but despite that it's a game I suspect I'd never part with.

Fun use of card drafting and tile-laying, two of my favourite game mechanics. Playing this game prompted some reading about the real Alhambra.

The thematic references to many currencies and different architectural styles make this game even more fun.

I like the independent tile laying idea, but there is not enough choices in this game to beat someone who is just lucky.   You can't plan ahead at all, unless maybe you are playing against 1 or 2 other people, and you are at the will of the deck more heavily than say Ticket to Ride.  With that being said, it is a great gateway game, plays fast, and looks pretty.  The management of the walls of your personal Alhambra is the only thing that saves the gameplay.  I still think O Zoo is a better game.  This one just doesn't have enough strategy to make it interesting.  You usually do what you can, not what you want.  You follow whatever course the game wants you to.

One of our first board games. We played the heck out of this one. Recently added the iPad version and played that quite a few times. We still prefer the physical game though, as there is too much information lost on the iPad which removes some of the strategic elements of the game!

Even though there are a gazillion of expansions available, we still prefer vanilla Alhambra. Great game for two! I also think that the 2 player rules (having Dirk as a dummy player added) are actually working quite nicely. 

Note: We played this game at least 50 times before we started logging plays!

If I should rate the base game alone, I would rate it a bit lower, but with some of the expansions thrown in, this game is actually pretty good! I think the base game is decent and a good gateway game, but there aren't many choices to make - much more to think about and tougher decisions to make every turn with expansions, and as I always play with a couple of expansions, I will rate Alhambra a 7.5. This rating is for 3-4 players only, though, as a game with 5-6 players drags out (even with the vizier's favor expansion).

My recommended number of players: 3, 4

RATING: 7
Rather random but good fun with 3 or 4 players, a bit like Union Pacific. It can be rather frustrating with 5 or 6. If you are lucky enough to have the right cards to buy some tiles with walls near the beginning of the game, you'll do well as you get to score your wall THREE times. Catching up on an early leader is difficult.

This game is simple and fun. When introducing it to my family and friends who are less interested in board games than I am, they were able to pick it up quicker than most games and seemed to enjoy it more.

When playing with friends who are more into board games it was pointed out that the game lacks player interaction. Other than possibly taking a building that someone else wanted you can't have much direct effect on other players, thus there is a higher level of luck involved than strategy.

This is one of my favorite games. It's easy to teach and it gives you simple but meaningful decisions each turn.  There is very little down time and since there is an ever changing currency and building market, there is no need to plan out more than 1 or 2 turns.  Even then, someone is sure to scoop up that bill or building that you wanted.

The expansions for Alhambra are hit-or-miss.  The nice thing is that they come in packs of 4 and are all optional so you can add the mechanics you like and ignore the rest, or mix and match for variety.

It's ok. I honestly don't look forward to playing, but I am not opposed because the game is good. I like the scoring and the spatial aspect of the tile placement, and that's my favorite part. The luck of the tile/card draw is frustrating because a player can really get hosed on the draw. The good news is the game is easy to learn and play, it also plays surprisingly well with 2 players. Best with 3 or 4, anymore than that and it gets very random.

Easy and fun to play. Not as cutthroat as Carcassonne, which is a good and bad thing in our house - means Alhambra probably won't get as much play as Carc. Then again, I haven't played the 2 player variety.

UPDATE 4/07 - I introduced this to my wife and she told me to buy it before we even finished the game. It's going in our next shopping cart, unless I find a trade here.

It bugs me that some say this is an "Arabic-themed" game. It's not. You might say it's Muslim-themed.. Alhambra was a Muslim outpost palace in Granada, Spain. This is why we have four currencies in the game which relate to currencies which would have been used commonly across Europe and the Muslim world.

Rated 7 after one play. Solid game. I had heard this described as "best to play as your next Carcassonne," but I don't see the comparison. The tile laying is cool, but this is really hand management with the four different currencies. Nothing totally unique, but this is a solid design, and if my wife likes it, I might pick it up as another "couple's game."

My first play was with six players, which meant that a turn was totally tactical. But I could see where this would be really neat with two or three players... and probably even four. The chance to plan a little more would be nice.

Another play, this time with four. Again, this strikes me as a solid game, but even with four, it's a bit hard to plan. This seems ideal for two or three players. That means, if I'm buying this, it's as a spouse game. It most reminds me of Jaipur... grab cards, and spend cards to nab goods (Jaipur) or tiles (Alhambra). Alhambra adds the fun of building your territory... but takes longer to play, and there seems to be less direct "screw you." A good game, but one that I'm not rushing to buy.

We play this game fairly often in the family and is not too long nor has a big box (good for travel). Special attention should be paid to how you place your tiles so as not to block other tiles you may buy later. Some of the expansions add flavour, we like the diamond cards, can be used for any type of money card.

With even four players it becomes very difficult to plan ahead and the game is about who happened to have the right color of money when their tile happened to come up.  Only three plays, but I'm not terribly interested in finding whatever depth there is here.

We loved this from the very first game.  The rules are short, even with lots of examples and illustrations.  However, there are always decisions to make.  You have to balance between short-term points for set collection and long-term points for tile placement.  You have to manage money carefully, as you always need to pay with the correct color of money, and if you pay with exact change you get another turn.  We play 2-player, which uses a dummy player.  The dummy is well thought out and unobtrusive to gameplay.  Although we'd seen alot of pictures of the game, the artwork was much prettier than we expected.  In short, this is a wonderful game.

Alhambra is a pleasant game.  Certainly not one of my favorites, but it is very approachable for newcomers, which is a plus.  There's slightly more luck than I like in my games, but there's enough thinking involved that I enjoy it.  The two player game didn't interest me very much as there was too much randomness.  Also, the six player game has some downtime between turns... so that may be a bit of a stretch.  That, or maybe my group just analyzes too much.  UPDATE: I ended up getting rid of this one.  I played it some, but it never really clicked with me.  There is some depth to it, but not enough to interest me for what it was.  With many players, the downtime is also just too much.  I actually like Metro and Roma from Queen better than this one.

We own the Big Box edition, which includes the first five expansions. Hence, my comments here reflect only playing with added modules. I like, but don't love this game. It is a very good gateway game and the rules are simple. With multiple players the game bogs down...which is what makes the expansions so helpful. With them, players have other options without added serious complexity. Works really well as a two-player in spite of the dummy player.

Not a favourite of mine...but it has been a hit with many I've introduced it to.

Pretty easy to teach, great for when you want a mellow game or a game to teach to someone who may not be able to handle too many rules (for whatever reasons) but may enjoy the puzzle-y nature of placing the tiles in their alhambra.

Very simple. Very Ticket-to-Ride-esque (i.e. play cards or take cards on your turn). A six player game has the following problems:
-it's just too chaotic for any sort of long term planning
-there aren't enough turns because the number of cards doesn't scale dependent on the number of players
-the game ends before you feel like you've accomplished very much

With fewer players, it would not suffer from these problems.

Alhambra is like playing Tetris for me. Its more of a mindless activity that I just CAN'T STOP DOING. Actually, that sums up my feelings toward it...but its not entirely accurate on a couple counts.

First of all, I CAN stop playing it. What I mean is that I enjoy it on about the same level as Tetris. But I certainly don't feel like it is a great game. But there is a peacefulness in the rhythm of the game that appeals to me, even if I think the game itself is marginal.

The second thing is that there are SOME decisions to be made...but a lot of it comes down to learning how to see the planning of the placements, and luck of the draw. 

I wouldn't mind playing any time someone wanted to...but I can't see myself suggesting this one.

Can see why this won Spiel des Jahres, in that tradition this is a medium weight game that would likely work well as a 'cross-over' title. The chance to take 2 or 3 turns in a row through good hand management is nasty, while the palace building, which initially seems easy, becomes very tricky by the final round. A little too light for my tastes though, it seems as though one player in the game tends to get on a roll getting free actions and advantageous buildings, and then just starts to take off, leaving everyone else in the dust. Not sure if this is through good play or good luck, or a combination of them, but I know I was on the roll one game, and most definitely not the other, and I don't think my play style was radically different in either game. One (the first) I won by a landslide, the second I was in last place, and my score was doubled by the winner. Willing to play again, but I would need convincing...for a one hour game there are just so many better options.

Play is comparable to ticket to ride, either pick up or spend. There is more strategy in this though as what colour you buy is very much dependant on what colours your opponents have in their Alhambra's.

It's a glorified multiplayer solitaire. It would improve if the buildings had some special function. I've found no differences in the results or the fun you get between playing without thinking and doing so.

The tile laying makes me think of Carcassonne, but this game is really nothing like Carcassonne.  Players either draw money cards or buy tiles.  Tiles are either fit into their own Alhambra grid or placed onto their reserve.  Scoring occurs in 3 rounds and is based on who has majorities in a variety of tile colors.

I learned how to play this at DEXCON 15 by entering a tournament.  I got lucky and finished 2nd in the qualifier.  Played a few times since.  I love this game and the "city planning" tile placement can be VERY tricky.

Played with 2, 3, 4 and 5 players.  Each was great, but I think maybe 4 was the sweetest spot.

Despite the myriad of options available in the big box, this game has received very little table time over the years I've owned it.  I acquired it in one of my first big online purchases and initially regarded it as a bit of a mix between Ticket To Ride and Carcassonne.  It played well, surprisingly going over better with my parents than with my gaming group.  I think that the fact it entered my gaming world about the same time as Dominion frankly hurt it quite a bit.  While Dominion actually overwhelmed my parents a bit, it, well, dominated the table with our game group.

Enjoyable game but nothing that makes it really jump out.  The OCD in me really wants to make my Alhambra look nice rather than be strategically designed.  The mechanics are interesting especially the paying exact value for a tile getting you a second turn.  This makes it sometimes more beneficial to take smaller denominations of money in that part of your turn.

I gave this to A for her birthday, 2011.

I got Glen More for my own library to fill the same niche, but I think I almost prefer Alhambra due to the simplicity. I've since traded Glen More away. I do better with more luck thrown in, plus there is more spacial reasoning in placing the tiles. I love the spacial element, especially the walls.

This has been one of the best gateway games. A has played it with several people who went out and bought it for themselves.

RATING: 4
My girlfriend was quite eager to give this game a try, so when the opportunity presented itself, we leapt at it. The game is fairly simple and straighforward, with an interesting mechanic that you can only keep on executing actions if you pay an exact amount. However, with three players the novelty soon wears off, as it appears to take forever to end a game. There seems to be no way to escape the hard truth of working with what is on offer; if it is sh*t, your game will be sh*t too. It's kind-of sad, really: we expected a lot more from it, and this initial disappointing experience soured us sufficiently to avoid it. Much later, I was obliged to sit in on a game with 5 players, and had or a more or less similar experience: no good cards, no good play. You will not make me happy by requesting this title.

RATING: 2
Bleh, I hate this game.  Do the same damn thing every turn, hope the tiles you need come up.  If you luck-sack into having the exact right type of money and get an extra action, well, you were lucky given how improbable it is that the piece you need is going to be there when it gets back around to you.

RATING: 5
I find this game enjoyable with fewer players.  There are too many times that the building you want gets bought and then the money you have is worthless.  Of course this is a game about picking your spots, but still.

Traded this away as I really just didn't want to play it anymore, and I know many people (including several whom I bought it for) that own it.

RATING: 9
Alhambra is one of my favorite games of all time - currently ranked 5th for me in my latest ranking. It is simple enough that I've been able to teach my family, but still deep enough that there's strategy to it. I prefer it as a 3 or 4 player game, but it can go to 6 if you desire. It is a tile-laying and set collection game, which are two of my favorite mechanics. On your turn you can either take money, purchase a tile, or rearrange your alhambra. But if you purchase a tile with exact change you get to take an additional action. So you are often left with a difficult decision of whether you should overpay for a tile, especially if it is critical for your alhambra. Most tiles also have walls that provide additional scoring, but also restrict your placement.

Acquired May 2007.

First play was a three player game with my boys in August 2007.  Its a new game for me but it sure seems like a lot of fun.  Think this will go over well with my non-gamer extended family.  

Our first 2 player game with the wife didn't go over well.  She agreed to try it again and it went over much better.  Her initial dislike/confusion came from how much advantage Dirk (fake third player) had.

Played this game once (never again) with six players.  Too much luck and impossible to do any forward planning.  Seems like three player is the sweet spot for this one.

June 2009 - Traded away my copy and picked up the Big Box.  This is a good family game and one I select to play when the wife isn't up to anything complicated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The rules to this game are well written just as the box says. There are fewer rules than it seems in the end but there are some subtleties to the tile placement which can be less obvious at first. Very accessible to non gamers but perhaps a little boring for the geeks after the first few, would be my guess.

RATING: 7.5
At first the game exceeded my expectations.  Has a very addictive quality possibly due to the randomness of both the money and the building cards.  The knock on the game is similar to that of Lost Cities: not a lot of interaction between players.  It is a bit like multi-player solitaire.  Still, for me the appeal of the game overcomes any of those shortfalls.  After many plays, the game seems to have lost some of it's freshness.

Played for the first time today with 5 players. I can see why folks say it's not good with 5,  but we still enjoyed it. Makes for a tighter game. You have to do things faster and you can't strategize as well. Still good fun, though. I think it'll be awesome with 3.

Enjoyed this simple yet elegant game of building an
alhambra. Four types of currencies dictate what you can purchase. Nice set collecting mechanism of both money and building choices. Just had to have every expansion to ramp up replayability to the max. This put Dirk Henn
high on my list of designers to pursue , yet he went just a little too far in his game "Colonia". Sometimes
keep it simple stupid is still good advice even for game designers with proven hits in their repertoire.

RATING: 8
Fun game! Fair amount of luck in the game,  but there's no denying it's fun to play, especially with the right group of people.  It's not a mind-bender - just good, light fun.  I find it best with 2 to 4 players.  With 5 or 6 people, you can't really plan ahead, because by the time the turn gets back to you, your tile choices from the previous turn will most likely be gone.  Still, there is certainly a skill element in choosing and placing your tiles to your best advantage.
Of course - with 6, you could always buy two copies of the game,  and lay out 8 tiles to choose from!

I'm quite smitten with this game, which combines some of my favorite elements from other tile placement and set collection games.  Lots of choices and much to remember, yet the gameplay is simple and the game length can be short.  (Although the game length varies depending on if you have new or AP-prone players.)  This is a good "gateway 2.0" game.

RATING: 5
Has a black-jack-like quality in that you can do a lot of calculating and memorizing to gain a really small advantage. With 5-6 players, these tasks become more difficult and less meaningful, and even elementary strategies become less feasible since so much will change between a player's turns.

Tile-laying aspect is only sometimes strategically relevant. Timing of scoring cards makes for some really swingy randomness, and it's possible for the second card to still be in the deck at the game's end, which is kinda strange. 

I'd say its a 5-6 as a 3-4 player and a 3-4 as a 5-6 player.

The game drags too much and the lack of interaction makes it even more dull.
Designing your own city is an interesting concept, but it can quickly become annoying instead of exciting.
Max said: In a 6p game, you wait 10 minutes for your turn and when it's finally time to play, your best move might be to draw a card. And then you have to wait another 10 minutes. UGH!

It reminds of Jaipur somehow but Jaipur is much faster and fun!

There simply isn't that much going on in this game. Interaction is minimal and superfluous. Meanwhile, decisions are fairly obvious, and high scores revolve around fortunate tile draws and luck in drafting cards. Play with four or more, and this is outright painful, as too much changes between turns to allow for any strategy and the amount of downtime is maddening; even with two or three, it's just passable.

This is a good game on paper...but i wouldnt say it's a great game in play. 
The components are nice, the mechanics are decent but the overall package lacks interaction and real strategy as your decisions are fairly limited based on the money you have and the tiles that are available for purchase during your turn.

I think (the many) expansions may be able to save this one though, as the concept of the game is appealing, it's just not that much fun in it's current state.

also worth noting, that my group is 5, and i would guess that this is a much better game with 3...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Components: Soft, easy-to-see artwork and colors. The tiles are top notch, as are the boards. The orange and brown card suits are difficult to distinguish, and the cards could be a better quality. Also, it would be nice to have a track to record the relative quantities of each color tile held by each player, instead of constantly re-counting.

Experience: This game is about one thing only: exact change. The efficiency of buying a tile and also drawing one or more cards is the driving mechanism. The attractiveness and restrictiveness of the tiles belies that this is a set collection game. I prefer the dice spin-off.

2-6 players, 45-60 minutes, tile laying

Played twice with my son (6) and once with my wife. We had a nice game and it was quite fun trying to make all the pieces fit, which wasn't as easy as it seemed. Hope to play this again with more players, which will make the game more challenging I suppose.

Update: 
Two years later, have played this now with 4 and 5 players as well and it still is a fun game. Might add one or two expansions to the game for more variation and strategy.

The game is very easy to teach and has some good helping of luck with tactical decisions when it comes to buying along with some strategy when it comes to planning your Alhambra.  It all comes together extremely well in a game that plays quickly and has little downtime.  Have yet to find anyone who really didn't enjoy it.

Seems to work well with any number of players, the game just takes on a different feel.

Take money, buy tiles and build your palace by placing the tiles adjacent to your starting tile. Score points by accumulating most tiles of a certain colour, and by building an uninterrupted outer wall. Points are scored two times during the game and at the end of the game. You have 4 spaces where you can store tiles. These can be built later in the game. Best played with a limited number of players. When played with more than 3, luck becomes the most important factor in the game.

Alhambra is a mess with five people, but it's really very good with three.  It's even better playing with the Vezir variant, which gives players more meaningful decisions concerning collecting particular sets of buildings or constructing favorable walls.

RATING: 7.7
A fast and easy family game that deals a bit with probabilities and a bit with 2D space organization.
The game also requires an all time attention with other players tiles and with the calculation of each player´s score, so that a player´s own score does not get behind by the (uncertain) time of the 3 scoring rounds.
Sometimes "less is more" and i think this is definitely the case with this game, capable of deliver some enjoyable playing times, though still easy to learn and grasp.

Realistically, it's probably not a game that I'll be hankering to play. But I have to admit that it is a pretty decent game that still holds up till this day. I like the mixing of push-your-luck, resource management, set collection/area control, and spatial management. I like the game. But for some unknown reason, I just don't love it.

Light tile-laying game with random card drawing.  Not sure how it scales with different numbers of players, but a four player game was okay.  Pretty good opportunity for tactics using plurality of colored tiles for VPs.  Spending cards was reminiscent of Toledo's cards for movement.  Length of game was consistent with complexity and enjoyment.

An absolute classic.  I actually prefer to play the base game over adding the expansions, or perhaps only the first module of expansions because they don't make the game too fiddly.

Although I found it somewhat frustrating that the currency cards and tiles I required were constantly gobbled up by other players, I enjoyed trying to plan my moves ahead of time.  There is really no player interaction except that one player's move can thwart another's plans, rather unintentionally (it isn't particularly predictable what the next player will do so it seems more a matter of coincidence when you thwart them).

Drafting game, where you get different kind of money to buy different kind of building to enlarge your building site. Since everyone is eating in the same dish, you will usually end up drafting money for some building, but when you get there, the building has probably already been sold.
It gets really too random if played with more than 3 players.
Tried the 2-players variant, and it is a reasonable solution.

I see some similarities to Ticket to Ride, in Alhambra.  I get the same angsty feeling--drawing cards, hoping to get enough to buy the building I need to secure the lead in a color--that I get when trying to claim a critical route in TtR.  Alhambra is best with 3 or 4 players.

What I liked
* Fast flowing game that doesn't take long to play
* Gateway game easy to teach and play

What I didn't like:
* Some of the Money colours and tile colours are the same which gets confusing because you have to pay the number that is on the tile and ignore the colour... Should have used icons instead.
* Too chaotic and too luck dependant with 6 players, hopeing with fewer players (as backed up in the poll) and with expansion this will be mitigated as getting the right change & colour building on your turn is a huge advantage!!!.

A fun combination of card play, tile placement and resource management. The pieces are also very attractive. I advise placing newly bought tiles during the next player's turn to avoid excessive downtime.

Fun, stressful, press your luck game.  Play with 4 for more control.  Hold out for melds and don't waste your money.  I like how the walls make for big points while limiting your expansion: double-edged sword.  Quite tense waiting to see if the tile you want will make it around the table.  Watch out for Turm Raiders!  DOWNGRADE.  For some reason, this game just doesn't make it off the shelf. UPGRADE.  SOLD.  Just didn't get played.

Very simple yet deeply strategic little game.  I love how four different types of "currency" are used to buy a constantly changing array of buildings all with varying structures.  As if that isn’t enough to juggle, you also have to obey the rules of building placement.  Game does tend to get a lot more frustrating with six players.

Is it just me, or is this game just too random?  I mean, it seems that there's really no way to come up with a coherent strategy, because it all changes from turn to turn.  Not that it's a bad game - I actually enjoyed it.  I just feel that it all comes down to the random factor.  Now, I actually like some element of randomness in my games (embrace the dice.  Love the dice)  However, if the game could be played just as well by rolling dice to determine tile selection, then it's just too much.

Good and fun with 3-4, but I think I've mostly tired of this game now. Good exercise in tracking information if you want to play very competitively.

Terrible with 5 or 6 to the point where the game is almost luck driven due to how much the game state changes between turns and how few tiles you are able to get by the game's end. Good players will still do well, but it' just bad with 5 or 6.

I don't like games with "just so" constraints put on them.  You can't buy this tile for 4 euros, because you only have a coin for 5 euros.  Excuse me?  But even that is a minor issue.  The real problem here is that players can't make any plans at all, because of the unpredictability of the available tiles next time around.

I'm liking this game less and less (6-->5). Buy tile for exact change = good.  Anything else = bad...unless you know the round will end soon.  I guess I would recommend it for a group who likes non-confrontational style games.  Collect colored number cards and buy colored tiles. Try to collect the most of certain colors to score bonus points during scoring rounds.  This is really a 2 or 3 player game.  Any more and it starts to fall apart.  I would flat out refuse to play it with 5 or 6.

Update: After a recent playing...with 6 players...ugh...this game needs to drop from 5-->4.  It really is bad.  I won the game, but not due to any skill on my part...or lack of from my opponents.  It's just a random chance game with pretty tiles.

Alhambra is decent but not particularly innovative or memorable. It was a nice little tile-placement/set collection game that seemed generally inoffensive. Unfortunately nothing really stood out to me about it. I thought Carcassonne seemed to be a bit more fun as light fillers go, and would generally prefer to play that or Race For the Galaxy. A later play essentially reaffirmed this, only with the list of light fillers that I would RATHER play than Alhambra growing a bit larger. I still remain willing to play it, I am just not super excited about the idea.

Still can't see the major strategy of this game, other than paying exact price is good.
Update: liked enough by the group to get in several more plays.  I've won a lot of them, or placed second.  Like the bidding mechanic with 3-4 people, with 5-6, it gets way too hectic to see what will even be on the board by the time your next turn comes around.

One of the four classic “pillars of modern boardgaming” (as Will Wheaton calls them).  However, compared to Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride or Carcassonne, Alhambra is the often forgotten one.  When “Isle of Sky” came out in 2015, I often heard people comparing it to Carcassonne, but its closer to Alhambra than Carcassonne which shows that no none seems to remember Alhambra much anymore.  I think this comes down to a number of factors.  There has been a total lack of marketing or ongoing promotion on the part of Queens Games and Queens Games’ confusing assortment or versions of this game floating around out there: some versions have names on the tiles; some with just language-independent stars on the tiles; a beautiful ‘family’ edition with the scoring track and tile placement board combined into one; and the original and confusing multi-board version which seems more like a travel-version.  At least in the Anglophone world, there is often the unfamiliar theme (a trip to Wikipedia will greet new players the an explanation of ‘an Arabic name for palace/fortress in SPAIN’) and many players often can’t pronounce or understand the names of the buildings/tiles when they are written out in English.  
Still, the game mechanics are rock-solid after all these years.  There is still luck in the game, but much less so than Carcassonne or Ticket to Ride.  The set-collecting of money cards remind new players of Ticket to Ride while the placement of the individual tiles gives a Carcassonne-style puzzle game to EACH individual player.  Perhaps because it is so under the radar for gateway gamers, they don’t really have any expectations going into it and are very surprised how involving yet streamlined the game is.  There is also the added competitive aspect of having to keep an eye on other player’s boards when deciding if purchasing a building/tile is advantages or not (just like the 2015 “Isle of Sky” game).  There can sometimes be downtime between turns when playing with five or six players, but much less so than Carcassonne because players often already know what they plan to do when their turn comes around and are just breathlessly sitting on edge hoping other players don’t buy the tile they have their eyes on.  
Perhaps because I live in New York City, I thought the re-theming of the game into “New York” some years back was a good idea, but many thought the pasting of the new theme didn’t match well with the mechanics.  The truth is, replacing the walls with streets didn’t make any sense, but you don’t have to live here understand that replacing walls with rivers would have been perfect (we are a group of Islands surrounded by water with rivers and canals often forming boundaries between neighborhoods and boroughs).   
I find the game still goes over very well after all these years and holds up amazingly well. 

Updated Caveat:  This game should not really be played with more than four players, and especially not with six.  With only four tiles up for auction, in a six player game its almost a guarantee that any same tile won’t be around when your turn comes again and thus strategizing becomes next to impossible and the game becomes too random.  Still, a FANTASTIC game with four or three players.

Alhambra is a really good eurogame. It reaches the 6th player threshold, that provides a good light-soft eurogame for a lot of players. 

In Alhambra, you take only one action per turn of three that are available (just like Ticket to Ride or Terra Mystica), but in a good hand, you can accelerate your game by chain actions (buy tiles at an exact price). 

The game is colorful, easy to play, easy to learn. A must in a familiar game collection. Its mechanics are clear. You take money or you spend money. Spending money is for buying the pieces for your inner garden (the inside of your Alhambra). And the game rewards you for made a good planning in buying and in placing the garden's tiles.

After first play:
After hearing so much about this game I finally played it and was pretty underwhelmed. Take some money or buy a tile, use exact change and take another turn...Place tile in tableau trying to extend your wall. Rinse and repeat for an hour.

This should either take half the time to play, or include a little more to continue to earn praise. 14 years ago I'm sure it was really cool, but felt like half of a game now.

Pros
+ Simple to learn

Cons
- components aren't anything spectacular
- gameplay is repetitive with too little tension
- game length

Good for a family with kids looking to get into games...But so are so many better games at this point.

Update: after playing this another half dozen times on Boitejux I still feel like for the most part decisions are extremely evident, but player count does matter, I think 3 players is the optimal number. Most of my plays have been with 4 and at that count its too unpredictable and therefore scripted. Not a bad game, just not anything that gets me going.

I was quite surprised with Alhambra, a game that I admittedly ignored over several years because a) nobody ever hosted it and b) I wasn't going to buy it because everyone calls it a gateway game.  Even still, I found it to be much more strategic than i had expected and it turns out that this is a pretty cool game.  I don't know what the expansions bring, but the base game is a neat twist on the tile-laying genre where players are jockeying for different-colored cards (representing four different currencies) in order to purchase tiles/buildings from the main board.

While the theme is pretty much pasted on, there's still some great decisions to be made here, but with the draw of the cards, there's obviously going to be some luck involved.  Typical Queen production values make it a nice tactile experience as well, but in the end, it's cards and tiles, so nothing entirely too special on that front.

Great game and yes, it's also a great gateway game.  I'm glad I finally got to play it.

This game has several elements that work really well together.  The tile laying of Carc, the need to realize how your move affects your opponents of Puerto Rico, a good dose of luck of the draw of Carc, and the repeat your turn aspect that is unique to this game (of the games I have played).  I love this game at 2, 3 or 4 players.  Probably wouldn't play it at 5 or more players -- any semblence of control would disappear.

Recently replayed Alhambra with some friends. I enjoyed Alhambra more the 2nd. Wasn't to fond of my first game of Alhambra. It was possibly due to having better understanding of the game rules or the people I played with.

I wouldn't say no for a 3rd play of Alhambra. 
Alhambra is not something though that I would buy, not yet anyway until I get more games played.

Alhambra is better than I first though. It is a little deeper than I though with some interesting strategies. Simple and plays rather quickly. Some luck, chaos and screwage factor, little control. Card drafting and majority scoring. Multiplayer solitaire.

I know that there are a lot of expansions. Would like to try some of them to see if they are worth while and how it changes the game.

My rating for this SdJ winner has dropped some as I find myself more enamored with other titles and not playing (or wanting to play) this one very often.  I think my plays of Stimmt So, this game's forefather, have tarnished Alhambra's image as I've recognized how MUCH luck plays a part in what's available, in which currency, and at what price.

That said, some of the expansions help to mitigate the luck to some extent...

My only real gripe is that the box says "Great for Two Players!" and then you find out that the only way to even try to play two players is to add an imaginary third player (named Matt). And if Matt were to randomly draw a majority in purple and red tiles, then you and your opponent just got beat by an imaginary player!
I suspect that this game plays best with three, and is too random with anything more than four players.

Awesome Middle Light Game.

If you are unable to react to a changing drafting table, and whine because the last player took the thing you wanted, then this game is not for you.

If on the other hand you like reacting to rapidly changing elements, building a complex little city, and a modicum of randomness, this game is straight up gold, or denarii.  

The one problem I have is the endgame, where the yellow money is far more valuable than the others.

My wife and I played Alhambra non stop when we first got it and both really loved the sense of being able to build our own "Alhambra", trying to get majority in the tile types and a nice long wall.  3 players is best in my view, although the 2 player "Dirk" method also works fine.

UPDATE: After playing it again after a while, we decided it's one of those "middle tier" games -- a game that is decent but not one you really seek out to play. I like the mechanics, but it's never my first choice of a game to play. Also, it seems that we're alone on BGG in that we don't care for the two-player game. (Too cutthroat for us, I guess.)

At $15 from Fairplaygames, I couldn't pass this up. I like the blend of puzzle (fitting your Alhambra together) and resource management/majority control. My main caveat: the box says 2-6 but I'd only play it with three or four.

See my review for more details.

A fun challenging game.  Attractive artwork, nice components and an intriguing combination of gameplay elements make for a heady enjoyable and very replayable game experience. Set collection, tile drafting and tile laying, provide the puzzle set to be worked out.  Simple actions lead the way to dimension and depth that is quite entertaining. Competition is lightly blended into an otherwise solitary "building" process. This game scales up surprisingly well - plays almost as quickly with four players as with two.

A good tile-laying game with interesting buying and placement rules, but, at the same time, the placement rules are overly restrictive. The method of obtaining money is very simple and rather boring, which leads to many stale turns. This is counteracted by the ability to gain extra actions whenever buying with exact change, but it doesn't compensate enough. However, I really like the 2p-variant, and the decisions that come along with knowing the "3rd" (read: NPC) player's round-end tile counts.

Like Palazzo (which came later) this game uses "colored", or multiple, currencies for buying items. Each turn you get one action, but buying with exact change gets you a free second action.

2003 SDJ Winner, suitable as a light family game, requiring careful resource management, in some ways reminiscent of the style/feel of Ticket to Ride (although it plays quite differently).  Unfortunately the game is more dependent on luck and has too much down-time with more than four players, but it's great for 3 or 4, and even works well with two (using Dirk as a dummy player).

Very enjoyable, and does not wear out its welcome for what it is.  In our experience the person with the best wall typically wins, which I do not think is what was intended.  Also, it is very tactical -- the key to this game is to just make the best move when your turn comes up and don't plan for the future, as you'll get screwed more often than not. This is especially true with more players.

This is one of those tweener games that falls in between family game and gamer's game. These kind usually don't make it to my collection or stay there very long. I've only played the game once, and I enjoyed it well enough (helps if you have a crushing victory in your first game), but this isn't something that I would choose to play or invest in. 

The game offers a nice choice of taking money or buying a tile, and I find the extra action for paying with exact change to be quite clever. The tile placing is mildly interesting except for the walls. I haven't played any of the numerous expansions and have absolutely no idea what they bring to the experience, but I can only assume the game remains in the category of casual gaming. 

That said, it would seem this is an interesting enough game with plenty of variety to be a worthy choice for someone looking for something other than but similar to Carcassonne to play.

I love, love, love:

- the multiple scoring opportunities
- the wall issue
- that it's not too luck-based
- that it plays well with new players and family

I dislike:
- that it's a pretty light game

Final verdict: Probably going to stay in the collection for when family visits and we need a light game that would allow younger relatives to play without help.

fun simple and fast.  Center has money drafting and tiles to purchase.  Your personal space is a carcassone style build as you go player board which can be very satisfying to build.  semi-randomized scoring intervals and hidden game end cue add a lot of tension and an interesting take on the push your luck mechanic where knowing when to hoard up on money and when to buy becomes all important.  Overall an excellent game that would have gotten higher rating if we hadn't played hundreds of times to the point I'm rather sick of it.

Noted for winning the SdJ when some people would have preferred to see some other game win.  I like Alhambra quite a bit.  It requires judgment as to when to keep collecting cards and when to splash out and overpay for a key tile, "wasting" an action.  There's a lot of skill in the game, as I've learned by playing in the Alhambra tournament at the World Boardgaming Championships.  I prefer it to Stimmt So, its predecessor, because I think the tile-aligning mechanism adds to the game.

RATING: 6
An interesting blend of tile purchasing and tile laying made distinct with the twist of needing to use four different currencies.  I've played this with two, three, four, five and six players.  With four, there is a tension (or frustration) in watching your desired tiles or currency cards get snatched up before your turn, leaving sometimes only crappy choices and frequently confounding any long-term strategic planning.  Too much luck, I say; my wife, who seems to almost always win, says no, it's all about flexibility.  

With the two player variation, it becomes a different game, with less competition for tiles and cards and more opportunity to complete your strategies.

Five or six players makes Alhambra impossibly random and with this number, the Vizier's favorite becomes a needed if not necessary expansion and even with it, I would generally rather play something else.

update:  My rating for this game continues to gradually slide.  The more I understand it, the more chaotic and random it seems.  Started at 8 in my early game days.  Dropped to 7 after 10 plays or so.  Down graded to a 6 after my 30th play.

A kártyás változatot szeretjük, ez lényegében ugyanaz, a lapkákkal bővítve. Ami gyakorlatilag a városfallal való taktikázásban – és így a lehelyezési szabályokban -  különbözik a kistesótól. Így, ez a változat némileg jobb, változatosabb, de a kettőre együtt nemigen van szükség. Nem rossz, bár grafikailag kissé elavult, és a mechanika is egyszerű, de ez az egyszerűsége nem feltétlen hátrány. Kezdőkkel igen elhúzódhat (1-1,5 óra), de remek kis családi játék.

I had my eye on this one for several years before I actually played it. It lived up to my expectations. I like tile-building games.

Current prediction: will remain in my collection.

I'm very pleased Dirk Henn has won the SdJ. Years of hard work publishing his own games has finally paid off. I can see Corne van Moorsel going the same way too.
I've played this now and I like it. It is an improvement on Stimmt So but I do understand the criticism of no interaction. But it's a straight game and the construction element is nice. The walls on the tiles is a clever touch, and the extra scoring is neat, but they may have looked better in white than black.

Both Alhambra and Palazzo are similar games, but I happen to prefer this.  I like the money system and the production is nice.  Overall, a fun family game.

The right tiles and the right cards comes up for you? Great, you are going to crush! Otherwise? It is fun getting the 'exact payment' doubling, but if you just do it some times you wont win. . Just trod along. 
A tiny, tiny bit too light for me also. . . 

Would really like to try with some expansions, but I have a hard time seeing my main problem with the game, randomness, being sorted out enough.

Based on only 1 play. The game is fun, but the very first impression is that due to the lack of interaction between the players and the amount of luck involved, there is little or no space for planning. Simply your option is to wait your turn and then choose the best move given the tiles at your disposal in the market. On the same weight I think I prefer Palazzo.

This game should not be played by more than three players unless you like a lot of chaos. The two player variant with Dirk works very well too. I really like the little game-in-the-game with the wall puzzling. Although very luckbased, Alhambra is really about knowing when to buy tiles without the extra action, mostly in order to screw your neighbour. Even if this happens only once or twice in a game, this decision can often make the difference between win or lose. Like POF, this is NOT a multiplayer solitaire, because if you don't keep track of what the other players are doing you will most certainly get screwed.

[Set Collection] This SdJ winner is a very dry set-collection game, with a minimum of player interaction. It's also hopelessly random: random money, random tiles to bid on (the combination of which grants effectively random extra turns) and random timing of the scoring rounds. Guess what determines who wins in Alhambra? Ding! The extra turns! That last bit makes this a BAD GAME, a breath away from being broken. I don't see what the accolades are all about. It tries to be Princes of Florence, but lacks the balance granted by the bidding, has almost no control, is without the strategy and depth, and has little player interaction beyond swiping what someone would want, the ability of which is, yep, random. Yuck. ***UPDATE: Well, played my first game of Alhambra F2F and what do you know, it's as boring as it is on BSW. With the extra fiddling with the money and tiles and all, I'd dock it another half-point if its rating wasn't already so dismal. This just goes to show that I can use the SdJ award to determine what games to NOT buy (with the exception of a single aberration in 2000 - the magnificent Torres). Even as family games go, you can do much, much better than Alhambra.

RATING: 6.75
Rating is after 3 plays. It's fun, and intelligently designed. The mechanics work very well, and the turns go by quickly. However, I miss the lack of story telling after a game of this. It doesn't hurt the game play, but you can't leave the table saying "Whoa! Remember when_________!", which IS something I look for in games. However, I absolutely love the game it's self. I feel like it's more of a relaxing yet stimulating game.

The money mechanic of getting no change, and getting an extra turn if you pay exact price is great -- because it tempts you to wait until you have exact change, but you know that waiting may cause you to lose what you are trying to buy anyway.  A great game.

Interesting game, and the dummy-player used in 2 player games is an interesting twist. The game lasts a little longer than I feel it should, but the two scoring rounds during the game help add tension and make the time go faster.

However, without the Worker Huts expansion, the placement of each tile in relation to others is largely meaningless. Having 3 purple tiles spread across your Alahambra is equivalent to having them clustered in a purple area if you can line up your walls correctly.

In all, it's a fun game but I like Granada slightly more.

I like that there seems to be lots going on but the rules & scoring are very short & simple. The game plays smoothly without downtime. The 2-player game (with "Dirk") gives good opportunities to reduce your opponent's points because you can give tiles to Dirk.

Played for the first time at the Oasis of Gaming in 2002 and said: 
"Not sure this is one of my favorites. It has a lot going for it, but there is also an awful lot to think about and keep up with. It will take more plays for this one, but so far doesn't push my buttons. I give it a "7" which is considered "above average" for me, but not "Good" (reserved for 8's). Maybe further plays will change my mind."
Well...further plays (4 total) have changed my mind. I bought the game nearly a year later (4/1/04), and played it 2-player on 4/22/04, and two more times thus far in May '04. The second play was MUCH better as I understood what I was doing. We played it 2-player this time and its stock really shot up. I really do like this one. Want to play again. 
After 4 plays - I now rate it an 8.

I'm glad I got to play again for a second time recently because I recall not quite liking the game the first time I played years ago. Alhambra has some definitely neat things going for it. The trade off of taking less money for more opportunities to receive additional actions is great and I can't think of another game that does it quite like this one. And turns are simple and rules aren't heady, so in that regard it works very well. I still don't think I love the tile placement aspect of it though. The walls are there to put constraints on the players and also award good planning, but I found it more of a frustration and less fun than I would have hoped for. I also don't like that you can't ever really work towards a tile in the immediate as it can easily be gone from the purchasing board when your turn comes up. Again, this is where the added flexibility of smaller denomination cards comes in (so you can jump to another tile) but the tile display is usually different when it gets back to your turn.  All you can do is hope a good tile turned up or theres a money card worth your time. But your tile options often feel more random than an intriguing tactical decision. Pushing the "randomness" aside and you're still left with an interesting game of figuring out when to hold off and when to buy and when to exchange and so on. I would play again. I just don't know if I found the game "fun". But I do recognize the quality of the design and I think there is stuff in here to explore. So again, I would play it again to see if I could wrap my head around it better.  And good to note: the 2-player rules work very well!

Family fodder: easy mechanic to pick up, but feels like the tile placing mechanic could be deeper -looking forward to playing with expansion 4. doesn't scale well above 4 players. Don't even think about 6 players. 2 player games work fine with the extra "dirk" AI player rule.
 I dropped my score for this. lacks any tension and seems to just drag on forever with few meaningful decisions. It's easy to fall behind and lose traction purely from the luck of the draw. No tension, little interaction. Blander than flour paste.

We also own the Vizier's Favor and the Magical Buildings expansion.  All cards are sleeved.

We had the Anniversary addition, but didn't like the board so we crafted some replacement components using geek-provided images.  No box - this one is a keeper.

Rating is for 2 or 3 players ONLY(!), unless you include the "Vizier's Favor" expansion.

My wife and I really enjoy this as a 2 or 3 player game. She ALWAYS gets the longest wall!  I love her for it.  One time her Alhambra was completely enclosed at the end of the game.  She's such a cutie!  This game is AWFULL with 4 or more players.  Your ability to defer opportunities with some hope of them still being extant on your next turn is greatly reduced, thus taking away much of the game's tension and enjoyment.

The Vizier's favor does help fix the 4+ player problem by adding the ability to interrupt someone else's turn.  With 4 or more, this is a necessary expansion.

A tile laying game where you draft your money and then buy building tiles with that money. You then arrange the tiles to make the "greatest Alhambra". This is a light game that can be played with non-gamers. Beware, although this game actually supports 6 players, it actually plays best with 3-4 players. Trying to play with 5-6 players will feel frustrating due to inability to plan.

It's hard to comment on this game.  It's a good game, I'll grant you; the number of times someone nabbed the currency or building I wanted right before my turn made for some delicious tension.  But it hard to seriously compete in a category when you need to wait for the particular building turn up while having currency of the right color.  It feels like the person who wins succeeded, not by long-term strategy, but being able to take advantage of momentary opportunities.

Basic Alhambra acquired December 2005. (As of November 2006) We have played this game only a few times, and everyone seems to like it. I have never done well at it, for some reason, but I still suggest playing it occasionally. The game is easy to learn and provides some good challenges. As is typical in this type of game, you can't do as many things during your turn as you wish to do, so decision-making is critical. I believe this will continue to be a popular game in our family group.

May 2009 -- This is one of the family's favorites at this time. We play it fairly often, and we are considering trying one or more of the expansions.

October 2009 -- We purchased the Big Box with all expansions and are gradually trying them out. We have added several extensions permanently to all our games, including the coins, thief cards, diamonds, money exchange cards, master builder cards, and vizier. We have enjoyed City Gates and City Walls, and are hoping to enjoy other extensions. -- We gave the basic game to our daughter, son-in-law, and grandchildren.

Impression after 2 plays -- might be slightly biased since I've won both games! =)  My current favorite game, enough combo of randomness and strategy, feels like a more interesting version of "Carcassone".  Easy to pick up and a great filler!                                                                                    UPDATE:Turns out to be not so much of a filler in 4 player games. I've played it a few more times, and have lost just once thus far -- but nevertheless it feels that the luck factor is quite present.  Having people "stealing" all the pieces you need to purchase round after round can get quite frustrating, but that's the nature of the game (like 6's and 8's never coming up in Settlers - when they "supposed" to).  The ease to learn is a sure winner in my circle of friends, a quick favorite now in my group.

Gorgeous components; Your palace is satisfying to build and pleasant to look at. Colors are outstanding.

I've only played with 5 or 6, and it's not much of a game. You cannot plan anything with that many players; you simply buy whatever you possibly can with the money you have, for the most part. Downtime can be too much if players overanalyze.

Little or no strategy or thinking with 5-6 players, but my rating may rise after playing with fewer. (At least I hope it does; I bought the game with just that expectation.)

A light and fun game that plays well with 2 players.
Luck is a factor but you do need a different strategy (in additional to diversification) for each scoring phase.

With more players, it becomes more chaotic and random.

I don't know what to think. The game is original and neatly put together. The rules are rather simple (maybe with few exceptions). The pieces and the mechanics fit the theme (if you can imagine building a palace by placing the tiles). The thought that bothers me is the scalability. With 2 players it was achieved by adding a virtual player which is the least elegant way I have ever seen. It's similar to the other games by Dirk Henn - Atlantic Star or Shogun - and I didn't like it there as well.

Maybe I will get used to it - time will tell. But so far 7 is the highest note I could give Alhambra.

RATING: 5
Not too enthusiastic about this one. The flow of the game feels very repetetive. The chances to influence your position seem also too rare as often you know what you'd want, but get only what have an opportunity to snatch. Might have to try it with fewer players to discover it's merits.

big fan of this game. it works so well, build up your cash to buy a tile you want for your alhambra only for someone to beat you to it. works great with only 2 players which is a change for the 2 to n player games which tend not to work with only 2 players.

Rating is for 2-player with Worker's Huts and Camps expansions. With 3, rating drops to about 6. With 4, to about 4.

Played exclusively  2-player. Even with just one other real opponent (not counting phantom Dirk), luck of the draw looms large in the base game. My highest scoring game, 155 points, was achieved by simply buying for exact cost when possible and drawing a good balance of card colors otherwise. And never using the reserve.

After one 4-player game, think I'll keep this solely as 2-player. Far too little control otherwise.

Playing with Worker's Huts and Camps expansions makes this more of a real game.

Essentially you can buy a city tile, or take money.  If you can buy the city tile with exact money you go again.  Three scoring rounds score for most tiles of a certain type. 

Fun for the amount of time it takes to play.  Is luck driven in that the tiles drawn affect what you can and can't do.  

 It is a nice low-mid level complexity game to use as a time filler.

I would like so much to actually play this in its physical form again (I just played it once, then only online).

It's the epitomized Euro: little secret information, scoring on set collection and majority. Normally not my genre, but this is great fun.

You buy a building or get money (chosing from an array for both). Buildings and money come in 4 suites, if you pay the exact price for a building you get a bonus action.

As simple as that, you collect building and score points based on having the most of them.

On top of that, buildings can have 1,2,3 or 4 "outer walls", which you need to combine in your own Alhambra (emir's palace).

Fun, would like to try it again

It was upsetting when this game left BSW. It was better online, as you don't have to fiddle around with the money cards or the tile-placing or, erm, any of the fiddly bits. Still fun, though! (Maybe a Scrabble rack would help with keeping track of the $ cards.)

Great Game! tile laying and building within the economic constraints of the money in your hand.  very simple to learn. no social interaction but it isn't a screw your neighbor type of game either.  you have alot of choices in the game, yet arent bogged down by analysis-paralysis.  play your own game, but keep track of what the others are doing because you are competing for the points of the tile types.  This is a very visually appealing game!  I think this is the next game to introduce to non-gamers after you have them hooked on Carcassonne.  It even has symbols to help color-blind gamers!  I look forward to playing this game again.  When I do I am sure my rating of it will go up.

RATING: 6.5
An intriguing game based around strategy, bluff and (mainly) the order that the random tiles and money cards come out.  Sometimes you can't do anything wrong.  Other times it works this way for your opponents.  A game where you have to plan several moves in advance, like Union Pacific, to be able to acquire money and then buy the tile you need with that money.  Unless one of your opponents gets it first, which tends to set you back a lot.  It is worth giving Alhambra a serious go.

Pleasant light-middleweight offering for those who don't mind quite a lot of luck.  The tile-laying subgame is an excellent feature that adds another layer to the decisionmaking.  Seems almost like an Alan Moon homage with the randomly-shuffled wertung cards, the drafting mechanism, and the majorities in various sets of cards.  I wouldn't care to play with any more than 4 players, and the game is only enjoyable if players move through their turns quickly.  I actually like it best with two players and open money holdings.  Great visual appeal makes Alhambra a more gratifying experience than predecessor Stimmt So.  However, the inability to intelligently plan ahead means that both games are better configured for families than for gamers.

Alhambra is one of those classic light Euro games, like the ones that got me into the hobby.

Because there are two different draw decks, buildings and money, the random elements in the game are higher than they first look. That keeps the game light but it also makes it fun.

While the competition is indirect, it is also fierce and the game often leads to good natured swearing.

This game is a little dry, but I still enjoy it. The choices are few and simple yet so difficult to make. Trying to decide when to buy buildings without exact change is brutal yet so important. This game with 3-4 players requires precision, building your city to maximize your points for the amount of money you spend and the number of tiles you lay. Placing tiles while balancing the benefit of long walls with the danger of limiting your options gives Alhambra a 'Carcassonne-esque' element. 

With larger numbers the Vizar, which comes in the first expansion, is necessary, but you can just look up the rules and use a makeshift piece (like the additional colored disc for each player).

I need to try more expansions but they are so expensive ($25 apiece, really?!).

I am sure this one will rise in my estimation if I play some more. *UPDATE* Now I own my own copy I am getting a chance to play this game more. It is none confrontational, simple to explain and you are guaranteed of wrapping a game up within an hour. This is one of the rare games that my wife wants to play. Up to a 7 in my estimation, if it hits our kitchen table many more times that might become an 8, never higher though. *UPDATE* Had a poor experience playing this game with 5 gamers April 05.

After 5 games still not totally sold on this game. We have only played 2 player games with the Dirk variant so perhaps that is the reason it just doesn't seem that much fun. Maybe it will open up with more players?

Starting to get under our skin after more plays. Dirk variant is actually quite good, or bad, depending on how your game is panning out.

I generally have a good time playing the game -- it's fun to build your Alhambra, almost independent of the score.  At the same time, it doesn't give the level of excitement that some other games do.

RATING: 5
The "four currencies" thing was genuinely surprising; I figured any core mechanic from a beloved gateway game this old would be familiar to me. I think I like it?

Mostly, though, this has a few ideas I liked in Quilt Show, but where Quilt Show has its (maybe too sudden?) simultaneous guesses about how big a quilt other players will make this time, Alhambra has the downside of many area control games: perpetually rechecking how you're doing against each opponent in each of six areas. I could do without that.

But it's cozy, and I'll take it over Ticket To Ride any day.

Alhambra really is an anomaly for me, in that it has little to no player interaction but I still like to play it. There's a good buying mechanic in this game, where over paying for a tile gives you no change and no bonus action (so you can nab those tiles you really need by over paying but you'll be wasting some money). The game plays fairly quickly, which is always a plus, and my girlfriend always wants to play which is a huge plus.

The thing to love about this game is how it's based on the actual castle of Moorish kings. And you get to build the castle of your own, just like they did years ago. Plus money makes a difference and the walls as well. Just like in the original Alhambra standing in Granada region. 

Very enjoyable game. I haven't tried the expansions yet, but I will. But something tells me, the game will be even better...

Easy to learn, quick to play and has some tactical decisions to make in order to advance your own position or screw another player. It doesn't have the depth of some other Euros but my regular gaming friends outside the club are relatively new to gaming and so this seemed like an ideal game.

Having played a 6 player game with my friends I stand by my initial thoughts on this game despite a slight problem of keeping everyone's attention on the game during other people's turns. I think this game would work better with 3 or 4 players as there would be less downtime and more opportunity to make tactical decisions.

Overall I think it's another great game to teach to new gamers as it introduces mechanics like card drafting and tile placement.

A Christmas present from some good friends, this is an excellent light-euro game featuring card-drafting, tile purchase and tile-laying. Highly deserving of it's Spiel des Jahres award in 2003.

The slight unpredictability of when the scoring cards will come out, gives the game an added level of tension, and whilst there's no direct player interaction, there's plenty of ways to indirectly influence other players by your card choices and tile purchases. It's particularly satisfying to hear someone moan when you purchase the tile they had their eye on.

Plays well with 3 to 5 players, but not as good with 6 as there's a lot of down time and you have much less control. The official 2-player variant is playable, and pretty good.

The bidding was interesting, but I didn't find the game that much fun.  I guess it was way to dependent on the tiles available.

RATING: 4
(1 play) A bland, inoffensive game of buying tiles to place in your separate playing board, that you build up using the tiles.  Players get one action per turn: buying a tile, drawing cards (used to buy tiles), or rearranging your playing board.  If you pay the exact amount for a tile, you get another action.  Players earn points during scoring rounds by having a majority of tiles in a given colour.

This is another one of those dull Euro games where everybody does their own thing and there's no real way to affect someone else other than buying a tile they may want.  At least it's short, so it's an OK filler while you're waiting for someone else to finish a game so you can move on to something deeper.

I really like the mix of mechanics in Alhambra; none of them are really new but they hang together beautifully. It can seem quite a solitary game, as you buy your tiles and build your little town, but the fact only those leading on each colour of tile score keeps things really interesting and can lead to some tough tactical decisions, especially late in the game. Now with a few expansions it's really coming into its own, but the base game I still rate a 7.

This is an excellent gateway-type game and belongs right up there with things like Ticket to Ride and Settlers of Catan. Very simple rules structure, but really difficult decisions. Both strategic and tactical play are rewarded, there are a few different reasonable strategic paths to victory, and turns are very fast. Competition occurs through trying to maintain majorities, not by interfering with other players. In some ways it surprises me that this game didn't become more popular than Carcassonne, but I guess it was a few years behind.

Great game, but has much more longevity with the expansions. Buy the big box, it's a great deal.

RATING: 5
Plays up to 6 players, and easy to teach.  Part of the strategy is to count how many buildings each player has, and how many are left in the bag, and plan to compete appropriately.  You can't win points in all the colours, so you have to pick your battles.  And of course, long walls have a huge effect on your score and can win you the game.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of luck of the draw -- if you are lucky enough to be offered exactly the right building at the right time, or if you can buy many buildings for exact change, you will end up with more buildings, and more chance to win categories (and hence the game).It's very frustrating to play this game with 6 players -- it's all about luck of the draw, which makes it hard to plan.  If you don't happen to have enough money cards, you can draft money in a colour that you think you can win with exact change... but then there are 5 players who can buy that tile before it gets back to you.  So either you over-pay for the new tile (and give up the chance to draft new money cards), or you draft money and hope that you can get an exact payment next time around.

A friend mentioned that he won't play this game with more than 3 players.  That could be a restriction that makes this game acceptable to me, and perhaps have it see the light of day more often!

This is an OK game.  I've played with up to 6 players and find the sweet spot is 4.  Anything above 4 and it becomes rather chaotic (can't really plan ahead), and less than 4 is good if all the players are relatively at the same level of experience (else the point spread will turn you away from this game).

Rating dropped from 7 to 6 following a 3 player game which ended with a 60 point spread between the 2nd and 3rd player...  I prefer games which are closer, where the last player has a chance to gain ground.

Light game, perfect for families. Planning ahead is increasingly difficult as player count increases. There is a considerable element of luck in drafting of cards a nd building tiles, but an experienced player will typically win comfortably over newbies.

I will not refuse to play this one, as it provides a lot of fun. With casual gamers and youth, this game could be really good one. For more experienced players, it is more of a solid filler. Some of the expansions are really good and provide variability and new ways to score.

I have the deluxe edition, which has a really nice board and solid components.

So much tension between turns as you wait to see if you can get the tile you want or if someone else snatches it up. Not much fun with 6 players though as there seems to be no way at all to plan as almost every turn there is 4 new tiles up so it feels a bit to luck based, but I guess you can just save lots of different monies and hope to get a good run towards the end.

[Initial Impression: 7]
Spatial visualization skills are needed to work on the game's puzzle-like quality, which involves setting up your Alhambra to easily be able to add new tiles while simultaneously maximizing the wall around its perimeter. I sometimes find myself entering a near-meditative state while crafting an efficient Alhambra. The other aspect of the game involves knowing which tiles to buy to aid yourself and which to buy to block your opponents. Tension mounts as opponents buy the tiles you were hoping for and then reveal a tile for your dominant currency. Overpaying for a good tile now may leave you unable to pay exactly (thus gaining an extra turn) for another good tile later.  The two-player variant is surprisingly good, partly because it ramps up direct competition for tiles and partly because it is difficult to win against the dummy.

An excellent tile laying game. This game involves planning where you want to lay your buildings around your fountain (city centre). Walls must be adjacent to each other and you score point for each wall touching each other.

ON YOUR TURN : do one of two things. 

Option 1:
Collect cards with total value up to 5. It could be 3x 1 value and 1x 2 value or 2x 2 value and 1x 1 value. Or it could be 4 and 1. The rule is you can take and number of cards up to the total value of 5. You may also take 1 card of any value if it exceeds 5. There are 4 colours of coins to collect from Orange, Blue, Yellow and Green. 

Option 2:
Pay cost of tile laying on board equal or more of the value stated on the tile. If the value was paid exactly, take an additional turn and you may purchase another tile or take coin cards.

While purchasing tiles, you have an option to place that tile in the reserve to be placed onto your city later on.

Option 3: 
Remodel or swap tiles in your city. Sometimes it can be advantages but in most cases it takes up an entire turn therefore, planning is very critical in this game.

Great game for beginners and I think I will recommend this game to anyone who is new in boardgaming.

All-round good game. Interesting money mechanics, nice palast building, good components, set-collection, indirect player interaction, family friendly.

I've seen it in so many collection and at events, it seems to be pretty common/mainstream these days. And rightly so!

It somehow looks random and lucky game at first several plays. However, after read some strategy articles posted by puyo, and played again, then find this game is really good, and really stratigical.  You can plan to win, not so depends on the tile flipping as it shown.

In it's own Carcassonne-esque series of games (simple mechanichs, interesting tactics and outcome)it's really one of my biggest favorites. It's easy to teach to almost anyone with even the slightest sense of gaming and you can win the game when playing the first time or when you've really mastered all the tactics. Recommendable.

2 - 6 players (best with 3 - 4)

This is a decent game where you buy tiles in order to build on your own personal Alhambra city.  I've found that the game kind of drags when you play with 5 or 6 people.  I also like playing it with most of the rules from the original Stimmt So! (like skipping the whole build your personal Alhambra).  I gave this game to Tracey.

Maybe I'd like this game more if playing with fewer people.  With 6, it feels like you have next to no control over the availability of tiles and currency, making it hard to plan more than one plan ahead with any reliability.  I don't feel like you have enough options to play this game on a more tactical level though, moving from turn to turn like that.

Otherwise, reminds me of Carcassone a bit as an improved version, though I'd still rather play Drakon for tile placement games in that vein.  The theme was very thin and the game dragged on a bit long.  If I ever play this with 4, I imagine it's a better experience.

Really fun game.  Deceptive trick they did, making a boring game where you buy items into a tile laying game.  The tile laying and wall building makes the game very fun, but its easy to forget that the big scoring isn't int he alhambra building but the winning of the competitions.

It's a fairly simple, universal game - by which I mean anyone should be able to play it and have a good time. It's mechanically sound, just complex enough - but it's a little too bland for me. I play a lot of theme-heavy sci-fi and fantasy games, which might have warped my perception a little.

RATING: 7
A fun, lightly-themed game with a bit more strategy than most people play it with. Almost everyone I've played this game with gets caught up in purchasing tiles with "exact change" - which is a great bonus - but then they are left with a bunch of the same-colored tiles and I can score some quality points (bwahahaha!). 

I think the game works the best with 4 players. There are a few quirks to this game: (1) the scoring system seems odd. I am not quite sure why yet... the first time I played this game (with 4 players) the 1st place and 4th place people were only 5 points apart (tight game)... then the second time I played the 1st place person won by 40+ points... I like the longest wall concept - it seems very 'Settlers'; (2) the reserved spaces are rarely used - the game doesn't require too much foresight when constructing your alhambra and, therefore, doesn't require much waiting-for-the-right-tile (unless you are a perfectionist); (3) back to the scoring: I think the "longest wall" is worth too much when compared to having the most of a certain type of building... maybe that's the weird thing about scoring. I don't know.

This is a fun little collection game, with the added complexity of having to fit your tiles in a cohesive order.  I like it better than Princes of Florence, and feel it has slightly higher replayability.  

The expansions (of which I own many) are hit-and-miss.  Some add to the game, while others clutter it.  

Down sides are few, but significant.  The game can feel like parallel solitaire as each player has limited effect on others.  It is also hard for the directionally impared, as some tiles can be impossible to fit.

Maybe OK in the past but sort of too clunky for the modern age.
- Not worth planning ahead because the limited options will change by the time its your turn (downtime is a problem)
- Luck plays a very big part
- Rules don't really make sense (why have an extra turn for paying exact price?)
- A few one-off rules such as a reserve tile. Could have been streamlined.

Not a bad alternative lighter weight game. Only played once as 6-player so not sure how well it scales and how much I would want to replay, though there are plenty of mini-expansions to mix it up if desired. Typically I enjoy an app version of a game as much as the physical version but the app version of this game seems uninteresting and makes me question whether I would really enjoy the physical game often.

Megvettem hozzá két kiegészítőt is. De mindegyikben 4-4 kiegészítő van. Vannak, amik jól működnek, de ha túl sokat rakunk bele, akkor elhúzzák a játékot. 

Kettesben is jól működik a játék. Sokan akkor jó, ha a kiegészítőkkel rakunk be újabb épületlapkákat. Előszeretettel ajánlgatom kezdőknek, családoknak. Van benne taktika, mélység, de  akár egy gyermek is sikeresen játszhat vele.

Alhambra is an absolute blast!  I am not usually a big fan of lighter games, but for some reason, Alhambra is lots of fun.  It is easy to teach and play, and yet there is definitely strategy involved.  If you like building games, Alhambra is highly recommended.  It is one of the few games my mother actually will play and enjoys.  It is also a great two player game with the two player variant. . . . I've played almost all of the expansions (having got the Big Box) and they add a lot of fun and variety to the game.  It has taken 89 games for me to burn out a little on this one.  I'm going to let it sit for a few months and then bring it out again.  A brilliant game.

I love the mechanic for acquiring money.  I think there's a lot of clever design in this one.  There's more depth of strategy to it than I first thought as well.  My only real complaint is that the colors were poorly selected.  There's a lot of congnitive dissonance when you look at the green money in your hand and a green building and realize that one does not necessarily get used to pay for the other.  Otherswise a solid game, though.

I like stimmt so much better than this game since it's a much more pure game.  Plus, I feel the take more than one card if they are worth less than 5 is actually to nice to the players.  Small numbers allow you to get exact amounts much easier and if any player has the option to draw more than one card, they do.  It makes it more of a luck of the draw (did you happen to get the small card pull?) game in my opinion.

A simple little hand management game with some puzzle elements in the construction of the palace. For me, this is the archetypal game that seems heavier than it really is.

It's just about tolerable with 3 players, the experience deteriorates with each player above that.

RATING: 10
Alhambra is a relatively easy gateway game focusing on market manipulation with a very satisfying puzzle-like tile laying element. For me, this beats Carcassonne in the tile-laying genre simply because the scoring is much more intuitive, and the ability to plan and purchase tiles allows for more satisfying long term strategy. 

A huge bonus is how well this game plays with 2 players. I was afraid the "dummy" third player would feel like a cheap crutch, when in fact the "Dirk" player (we call them the Silk Merchant) allows for some interesting manipulation by both opponents.

I had my eye on the Big Box expansion for years before finally pulling the trigger, and boy am I glad I did. The base game is wonderful, but it really shines when you add in the variety of expansions which give it endless replayability.

Ageless classic. Have played it a lot. Este juego nunca aburre. Tú vas formando tu Alhambra con edificios que adquieres en el mercado. Las fichas de construcción están en una bolsa y se escogen al azar para añadirlas al mercado. Cada edificio se debe adquirir con la moneda que le toque en el mercado. 4 tipos de monedas circulan en el mercado. Al final los edificios y la muralla te darán puntos.

At first I was unimpressed with this one but as I got more plays in it has grown on me quite a bit. The strategies and interactions are more than they first appear. Great as a two player game.

This is a good tile based game.  It doesn't take much to learn how to play and the straegies are fairly strait forward.  There seems to be a fair bit of luck in this game however there is still a bit of strategy to make it enjoyable.  It's unique enough from other games that I have played to make it a must play.

Simple tile laying game.  Players must maximize their score by effectively managing the 4 different denominations of currency and choosing tiles wisely and placing them in the best spot on their Alhambra.  The game seems a bit too random to me for me to really enjoy it.  Maybe if I played it more, I would understand its nuances better and appreciate the game more.  However, I feel at this point I have played it enough to declare that it is too simple and random for me and I find Alhambra to be a boring game.  You will never hear me request Alhambra with so many other awesome games to play in its stead.

A terribly boring experience. I really like tile-laying but Alhambra wasn't fun at any moment. Sold after a couple of plays and tried the app that also didn't get me hooked
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Alhambra is the bastard love child of Ticket to Ride and Carcassonne.  It has the tile laying mechanic and strategic planning coupled with the four card draft pile and limited auction.  The game plays a little long for me and the interaction is muted, but I enjoy it nonetheless.  I thought initially paying correct change for everything was the way to go since you get all the free turns, but I've noticed a lack of scoring in the final round due to this strategy that sort of tanks it.  Anyway, Alhambra is a great game that allows plenty of choices and cunning.

Update:  Traded away.  This game seems too luck based to me and really not all that fun.  My girlfriend liked it more than I did (mainly because she always won), but she couldn't really come up with a good reason to hang onto it either.  I don't think it will be missed.

My family loves this game - especially my mother. Me - not so much. It just takes too damn long for how the randomness can screw you (nothing like seeing your opponents sweep the tiles you desperately need before you can even get close to them). Nonetheless, I still play it occasionally, I even win from time to time, but I'm never keen on putting it on the table.

Sounds tempting, but lacks a little elegance.  Simple and complicated at the same time.  Just doesn't have much to make it stand out IMHO.

Finally got to play it.  The spacial reasoning was a lot more fun than I expected.  The money part was pretty weak though.  All in all, it's very inoffensive and enjoyable, but it just doesn't have a spark.

Another tile laying game that sits comfortably in my top ten. I would rarely turn down a game of alhambra, I only wish that it played well as a two player. There is a two player variant where you play against dirk (the designer) as an imaginary third player, but its not ideal. I didn't enjoy being beaten by someone who wasn't even there. Recently got the expansions and looking forward to experimenting with them more.

RATING: 8
A nice little bidding/city building game. If you are good at counting tiles you will be able to mop up a nice little point score. The only thing is that everyone knows how many are left as well. My advise is only focus on 2 types of buildings for your city, if you start to get into too many races for the most buildings you won't win any. The combined points might help ,but you really want to corner the market so to speak.

Solid set collecting game.  Aim of the game is to collect sets of coloured building tiles which are added to your Alhambra according to some simple placement rules, points scored based on who has the largest set of each colour.  Extra mechanic from wall section drawn on tiles which, if lined up, score extra points.  This adds some important decision making into the tile choices, and doesn't really allow you to simply take the most valuable tiles arbitrarily.

I would say this is a family-friendly game, and one that children would learn quickly.  Works for 2 - 6, but 2 player game requires slight alteration where some tiles are given to an imaginary player who competes for points.  This is slightly weak but allows the game to work for 2 people which is useful.

The tile-laying is slightly trickier than in Carcassonne, and the fact that you have to buy the tiles (and thus consider how best to spend your money) means that this requires just a bit more thought than that other tile-laying classic. I do enjoy this quite a bit, but yet I still usually find myself going back to Carcassonne.

I'm not a huge fan of ghost players, so with two players this is a bit disappointing for me.

The first game I bought after I played Catan to death in spring 2008, but now it's eclipsed by all those bigger and more complex games I have discovered since. 
The mechanism and idea of the game is still nice though, it's just that I'd rather pick another game to play than this one (still so many games to discover!). I think this game's only weakness is that it doesn't really "shine". It's good. Not more than that.  (I should pick it up again, some day) ;-)

RATING: 2
The only reason this doesn't get a 2 or less it it *might* work better with fewer players....we played with 5.  First of all, 2 players started with 40% more money (28) than the rest of us due to the broken money mechanic at the start of the game.  Exactly how is it fair to give a player a turn (or two) advantage just because the money they got dealt was 19, and then they get a 9 for their last card?  Oh, and don't get me started on the money itself....4 different kinds.  I never even had a chance to get any green money the entire game.  Not to mention the walls basically make it a totally random game...you *might* have the right amount of money to get that tile, but it probably doesn't fit your palace.  And then to give somebody a big advantage to get extra actions just because they start with more money than you is a snowball.  We were wiped clean by the two with 28...they always seemd to have the right amount,  starting at the beginning, so they got to refill their hands with money right after spedning, ,while the other three of us rarely got to do the exact thing.  How did this get the SDJ?  BROKEN

UPDATE:  

1 - B-R-O-K-E-N card drafting mechanic
2 - horrid random tile appearance
3 - terrible, horrible multi-player solitare game

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The ideal gateway game; very easy to learn game with only a few options to decide between each turn, yet there is some depth there for more experienced players. 

Alhambra has a similar card collecting style to Ticket to Ride, but to me is better for beginners because your goal is flexible and open-ended, so it's more forgiving, you don't need to hoard cards and there's lots of variety from game to game.

The point system means everyone is usually able to pick up points regardless and also leads to some amusing outcomes (draws). Building your own Alhambra gives you a tangible achievement to invest in. This game also works well with 3 to 6 players without really changing the game length.

A deceptively simple masterpiece, Alhambra's base game offers much strategic satisfaction without too harshly punishing mistakes made early on, and includes a small, albeit pleasant amount of luck.

A dry tile layer that doesn't do anything devastatingly wrong but unfortunately nothing too terribly right either. No interaction and big luck factor here ensuring a lack of control will turn off many people and this really limits any kind of strategizing albeit a little planning is possible to overcome some of the luck and also for optimizing your point scoring opportunites. 

The game is mostly about reacting to what other players are doing and playing the odds a little with that and the tiles to score the most points. The 2 ways to score is the strength of the game, also competition for the cards adds a little tension. The fun factor is  definitely missing in this game though and forget about playing with more than 2 or 3; 4 or more would be way too chaotic and there are much much better games with those numbers.

Classic game that is deserving of the SdJ award. Very simple rules but the game presents you with very interesting (and difficult) decisions every turn. There are definitely some luck involved with the money cards and tiles that are on the board. Sometimes I don't even see a particular color to fight for the tile majority. But its still a fun game overall.

It's way too random. I feel like I have no control and absolutely no room to plan as tiles almost never make it all the way around the board. That said I've only played the base game and only with 5 or 6 and I've heard it's much better with 3 players and/or some of the expansion modules, but if you just buy the base game of alhambra and expect to regularly be playing it with a larger group, I'd say don't bother, there's nothing to get out of that experience.

Excellent game, well worth the hype surrounding it. This quickly became a group favorite though the shine has definitely tarnished for me after playing it so much, especially online. It's best with 2-4 players since it becomes increasingly chaotic with each additional player and it's just not that enjoyable with more than 4 players due to that fact. There is some luck as far as tiles draws and money draws but if you mind your cards then you should get some good opportunities at some point too. Stop with the expansions already!!!  I bought the first two but decided the 2nd added nothing so I traded it and will no longer purchase any expansions. The 1st was good but not necessary either.

This game has a reputation for being a multi-player solitaire. It should be more than that, though, since you're constantly watching the other players build their alhambras and comparing them to yours and judging what tiles to buy based on what everybody has already built. Unfortunately, it still feels like multi-player solitaire. For some reason, with only two players (and Dirk), I can feel the tension. With four, I don't feel it as much and the game drags a bit for me. Overall, there just doesn't feel like there's enough decisions to be made to keep me interested. My wife loves it, though.

I like what has been done with the game.  It is not simply a re-theming as was done with Atlantic Star.  But I would not again play this with more than 4 players.  There is simply way too much down time with nothing to do but wait.  You can't even plan ahead because so much will change before it gets around to your turn again so all you will do is get frustrated.  But for 3 - 4 players it is great fun.  Stimmt So! could be played with 5 or 6 because lacking the enhancements of this newer version it continued to move along fast enough for what it was, a luck-based family game with some agony and mild decision-making.

Nice tiling laying game. The exact change necessary for efficient turn actions tends to add a significant luck factor into the game. If tiles are drawn that match your money exactly you will be far more successful than somebody who has to overbid occasionally for the tile he needs. Note: No empty spaces internal to your villa and no internal walls unless both tiles have them.

This Euro game is a little too dry for my taste.  I like Euros where you can build an engine like Agricola or Roll for the Galaxy.  In this game you are just playing for points.

Buy tiles (representing buildings) and construct them into a grid.  If you manage your money well (and have good fortune), you can build multiple buildings on a turn.  It's all about properly managing your money and your buildings--or at least doing it better than your opponents.

One of my all-time favorites. I've played more than 300 games on BSW before if was removed and always enjoyed it with any number of players (yes! even with 6).
Deeper than it seems after the first play, it offers difficult choices at every turn without beeing too heavy.

This is an interesting game about building a palace.  The players have 4 types of currency and can buy areas for their palace in 6 different colors.  The players must arrange their palace to be able to keep growqin because som of the pieces have walls.  Players try to maximize points by getting more of each color than other players and having the longest wall.  It was very interesting.

The first time I played this was in a game/coffee shop with my wife and a stuffed hedgehog puppet (as the dummy third player). We brought the hedgehog home that day (who was named Dirk, after the designer of the game / name in the rulebook for the third player) and got the game at Christmas time.

The mix of hand management and tile laying makes for a unique game, and the 2-player game that may initially appear to be an afterthought works surprisingly well.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (September 2011)

I don´t remember why (I forgot the setup rules) but I feel the initial setup is very unfair. Alhambra is not a bad game but not one for me, it is too light and takes too long for my taste. If a game is going to take more than 90 minutes I want it to be more complex, also it has a very high luck factor (which I dislike). 

This is a fine game to introduce to non-gamers, but there is something about the tile placement mechanic that bothers me (I don’t like Carcassonne either).

On the good side, the game is beautiful.

I don´t want to play this game anymore but I might play once in a year.

Dropped my rating again. I realise if someone suggests this I usually try to nudge something else onto the table instead. I'll play, buuuuut... hmmm.
-----------------------------
After many games, the interaction level hasn't really perked up much, and I'm feeling the basic strategies feel pretty clear. I'm starting to say this has a limited total lifespan but was still a fine purchase.
-----------------------------
After one 2P play: (Ok 1.5 plays... we missed a rather important rule and started again.) I'm sure we didn't employ the entire scope for interaction. For the first half we kind of played mutual solitaire, but I can see there's more. The mechanics and dynamics seem refreshingly different. Rules are fairly easy to get... I'm surprised by the number of rules questions posted on BGG which are clearly answered in the rules in the box. My wife won our 1st game, which makes us both like the game a little extra :)

I've only played this once, so take it with a grain of salt. The game was a 6 player game and was enjoyable and fast. I didn't feel that I had all that much control though. I DID enjoy the game, but it felt fluffier than I'd expected. In the 6 player game, there wasn't much thought involved; it boiled down to: ok, what's available to buy now? If I could afford it and needed it, I'd buy it if I wasn't over paying buy much, if I couldn't afford anything on the board, I'd draw money. That really was about it.With less players, you would have more chances at buildings available to buy each round, with 6, it could change drastically.All this said though, I did enjoy it and would play it again. It was a nice game, quick, and fun to play. It's a good level of game for any type of player.I would like to try it a bit more to see if my rating changes. I really think it may go up with less players, but 6 certainly worked well and wasn't broken.I did not feel that I was influencing the game in any way, nor did I feel able to catch or hamper other players aside from taking a building they may have wanted or matching them (perhaps surpassing them) in a building color.Each round (there are 3) ends with scoring. In some ways it's akin to El Grande or San Marco with the Victory Points being shared out: if you have the majority of a color in a round you get the Victory Points listed on the score card. If 2 or more people have the majority of a color they share the Victory Points out amongst each other. In the 2nd round there are points if you have the most of a color and then the player with the 2nd most of a color will score. The third round spreads the Victory Points out to 3 levels deep in color majority Victory Points: The Most, Runner Up, and the Bronze Medalist.You also score points each round for each connected segment of a wall in your garden.It's a good game, but with my one playing at 6 players, it did not wow me.

1st impression:  Fun, but seems a bit long for the amount of luck that presents itself.  There are interesting decisions to be made, but not uniformly throughout the game.  Most often, the best thing to do is simply to buy whatever tile you can, especially if you can do so with the exact cost.
Will play again, but I think the replayability of ths game will not be high.

Best with 3-4 players.  Moves fast, and it's a struggle to be as efficient as possible in order to win.  I tell new players that it's a contest to see who can build the best "pleasure palace" - and that what really counts is who has the biggest harem.

As a light family game, Alhambra fills the right niche.  It was well deserving of its Spiel des Jahres award.  Tense, light, and a lot of fun to play.  My only caveat is NOT to play with more than 4 players... you might as well keep your eyes closed until your turn arrives, because the tile that you need will, most likely, not be there.

One of the good lightweights!  Scales great from 2-4.  5 players is ok, while 6 can be brutally slow as you watch your desired tiles/money disappear.  Of course, the vizier from Exp 1 really helps the speed for 5 and 6 player.  I really like the construction aspect.  I do think that the redesigning action is underpowered and should be beefed up a bit, perhaps more similar to Vegas Showdown.

One of my favorite family games. Nice pieces and smooth play. Its constituent elements aren't original (at root: the traditional card game of [gameid=15889] + Carc)--but it all works. You can tell it was designed by an expert. I love the increasing tension as game progresses, since each scoring round has exponentially higher points and builds on what you've constructed previously. I love the tiles get increasingly harder to place as game goes on and the points-at-stake go up so the end is tense. I like how you know approximately when scoring will occur--but not exactly. Wife likes a lot (bonus 1/2 pt). We were surprised the 2p version works so wonderfully; it's actually more interactive since you can actually strategize what cards you take from tableau, and you may donate tiles to the dummy-hand and thereby screw-your-neighbor.

I've only played this once so far, but I've been thinking about it ever since (which I always take as a sign of a good game). There's a lot of luck in the base game and the mechanisms are simple, so it would make for a great gateway game. It plays a wide rang of people, which is nice, too. I really like the tile placement. The wall rules make for some really tough decisions, you can build yourself into a corner pretty easily. But, the game lets you reconfigure, so you can find a way out of it, too.

This is a good, solid, tile laying game. Better than Carcassonne as you get to buy the tiles you want rather than random pulls from a bag. Timing is everything as collecting enables you to take more actions in a future turn, but will the things you want still be there when you've got the money?

This game is like Splendor in reverse. Instead of taking chips to buy cards and get points, you take cards to buy chips and get points!

This is old, but is relaxing to play, reasonably strategic, and I'm a sucker for any architectural games! WINH: probably because I don't have the expansions, which I don't plan to get. it does feel as old as it is in terms of mechanisms

Interesting mixture of tile placement with stock collecting "compete for majorities" type of game.  I prefer to play with 3, 4 is kind of pushing it, and I won't play with 5.

RATING: 3
Feels like a solitaire version of Carcassonne with various currencies and some imaginary forward planning. I say imaginary because what you likely plan for doesn't exist by the time your turn comes back around. Really very little need to be conscious when it isn't your turn; a highly tactical optimization affair. Not for me please.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A game I would not seek to play but would probably join in if suggested by others.  This game probably is more interesting with just 3-4 players, as with 5-6 it's just really hard to expect the same tile to be there when it's your next turn.  Think there's quite a bit of luck in this one (matching the numbers exactly, getting the desired tile flipped over) but there's enough alternatives that it's not totally boring -- I probably slightly prefer the dice game as there's a few more choices.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is so much better the Carcassone. The expansions for it are what makes it. Each expansion is four seperate modules that you can mix and match as you like. 

Although some are better than others, the different combinations you can have make the game infinately replayable

Although Carcassone has even more exapansions they are mostly very similar, I think the Alhambra ones are much more varied.

Its a nice game, but its theme/logic jars a bit.  There are multiple currencies for no particular reason, you don't get change for no particular reason - I know, I know, its an abstract game, there doesnt need to be a reason - but sometimes a lot of different elements being thrown together without a coherent reason behind them still matters sometimes, and in this game I feel it needs just a little more logic before I suspend believe - don't get me wrong, I'll play it - although no-one I know seems to be playing it much these days.

This is a great game & one that my wife really enjoys too.  It combines the resource aspect of CATAN with the tile-building aspect of CARCASSONE.  But instead of Wood, Brick, Wheat, etc., it's use of various currency from various countries really changes the ability to buy building tiles to place in your palace replaces this CATAN mechanic.  I'm going to have to get this one.

It seems to be conventional wisdom on BGG that Alhambra is a similar game to Carcassonne. I disagree completely - Alhambra is all about acquiring the right tiles, the actual placing of the tiles borders rarely requires much thought. Meanwhile, tile placement in Carcassonne is the very core of game. Alhambra is all about maximizing your own score. Carcassonne, if played competitively, is extremely confrontational - it's often in your best interests to stick it to your opponent rather than try to increase your own score.

What Alhambra does feel similar to, in my opinion, is Vikings.

Didn't really like this one. The idea is great but it seemed to be quite a low paced and in a way has no player interaction. Maybe it'll get better after a few games.

Update: No it didn't. It still feels like a solitaire with someone stealing your pieces while your not looking at the table. Somehow it doesn't feel like a game at all.

RATING: 8
This is a very eloquant game. It's fun, but not the party game kind of fun, but more of the "interesting" type of fun since the game is so well put together. It's a good quiet game to play in the evening and pretty enjoyable, but not something I'd probably bring to big parties (though with the right group it could still work).

If you're looking for a game where you yell at each other from across the table, this isn't it. But if you're looking for a fun and less confrontational game, this is a great one.

Fun Factor: Hard decisions to make each turn, seeing a piece you need without being able to buy it, puzzling tiles together

As a result of my family loving the dice game so much, I figured I had to get my hands on a copy of the original.

Picked up a copy of the gold edition in a math trade in exchange for Agricola, and is certainly one of my favourite trades. I seriously underestimated how well this game would be received. I had been fully prepared to deal with my mother and my wife preferring the dice game, but the subtleties of the game have won out over the (in comparison) static nature of the dice game.

Furthermore, having introduced the game at our first game night with another couple, they also loved the game and made hints at having to pick up a copy for themselves.

The fact that everyone who's come in contact with it so far has really liked it, combined with the opportunity to change the game with expansions, makes me think we'll be enjoying Alhambra for a while to come.

I picked it up from Tanga.  I think it works well with two, even though I have heard some people complain about having the invisible third player.  I don't mind it.  The day I get beat by him though;).  The game scales really well though too, and I have had fun playing it with 3,4,5 and 6.

A two-player game that requires an imaginary third player is NOT a two-player game and shouldn't be marketed as such. This is, however, a very delicately-balanced game. It was decent with two, but would be more fun for three.

Pretty decent fun. Good bits, simple rules, some strategy, some luck (because of the tile draw and the faceup money available), pretty low down time. May be a little dry (no desert pun intended). Enjoyable enough, but I'm not over the moon. The two-player game works pretty well, too, although some modifications are required.

Update: I'm feeling like Glen More does most of the things I liked about Alhambra better than Alhambra does them. Even Glen More's turn-taking mechanism, which is more directly derivative of Thebes, could be seen as a kind of auction (as in Alhambra), with "bids" in the form of spaces sacrificed on the track.

RATING: 5
I'm looking to play this a few more times.  I feel like I'm missing something - the game seems overly simplistic to me, though others' comments lead me to believe that I owe this game a few more plays.  

Update: I actually enjoy this more with 2 players with the dummy player "Matt".  I would guess that the enjoyment goes down as you add more players.  6 player games involve too much waiting, and the market is composed of completely different tiles by the time it's your turn again.  Compounded with the longer playing time, I would be very hesitant to play this with more than 3 players.

Further update: after acquiring the expansions in a trade, they add a little spice to the game and are interesting to experiment with.  I think that Alhambra makes a good gateway game due its short play time and relatively simple choices to make.  This is a solid game that doesn't achieve greatness, but is pleasant, almost relaxing, to play.

Update, 3/15: Supplanted by the card game (Stimmt So) version, which shows how superfluous all the changes were. Traded away.

I like this game. We often take it to cafes and play during our meal. It's light enough to avoid AP and just competitive enough to be entertaining. We mostly play two player, and I prefer it this way. (Although, don't forget to pull tiles for "Matt" the dummy player!) IMO the more players you add to this game the more random it feels.
Recommended (for 2 players).

One of the first more serious games I own and play (this is shown by the fact, that my rating for the weight of the game was "Medium Heavy"), so it will always be a little bit special. On the other hand, the game is pretty interesting. You have to always think at least about two things: which buildings you are trying to collect to be the majority owner and how to build the longest wall possible. For some reason, wall building is the weakest part of my play. Moreover, players have to decide if to buy a building paying the exact amount and to get an additional action or to overpay for a building in order not to miss the opportunity to obtain it. The most important thing is to not include too many expansions in order not to complicate the game too much.

Vienas iš pirmųjų rimtesnių žaidimų (tai rodo ir tai, kad prie žaidimo svorio buvau nurodęs "Medium Heavy"), todėl visada man bus kiek ypatingas. Kita vertus, visai jis įdomus. Reikia nuolat mąstyti bent apie du dalykus: kokių pastatų daugumą nori surinkti ir kaip pastatyti kuo ilgesnę sieną. Kažkodėl būtent sienos statyti man dažnai nesigauna. Taip pat reikia galvoti, ar pirkti už lygiai ir gauti dar vieną ėjimą, ar permokėti, bet nepraleisti progos nusipirkti. Svarbiausia nepadauginti papildymų, kad nepasidarytų per daug painu.

This is the best gateway ever, and a great, solid game. Love the duality of majorities and walls, to give you two things to think about when buying.

I have never won a game of Alhambra. I have only played four or five games of it at all, mind you, but I haven't won a single one, and I still like it quite a bit.

UPDATE: I have won two games of Alhambra now!

The mechanics are simple, it is not overly stressful, and I always love the feel of crafting or creating something. Alhambra does that last bit quite well, even if the aesthetics of a design are a distant third in importance to the length of the walls and the quantity/diversity of the districts. I think that it has a perfectly manageable level of luck, and—getting back to my first line—it is very good to play with non-gamers both because of the rule simplicity and because somehow the people I have introduced it to have all turned out to be really good at it.

I like Alhambra, and I think that it is a marvelous game to work people up to heavier things later on.

A quick tile laying game, and a classic one at that.  This one is easy to break out and teach to non-gamers but still offers enough challenging decisions to make it fun for gamers. The money making, and tile buying mechanic is really interesting and unique.  I like how you can pay with exact money and gain an extra action or just overpay to get the tile you need most.  Scoring comes down to set collection and majorities.  This one's a solid game.

Fand ich gut. Wir haben allerdings schlecht gemischt und es kamen die Charaktere immer direkt hintereinander. 3 Versteigerungen hintereinander zerstören den Spielfluss. Daher: gut mischen. Man sollte nur einen Charakter kaufen, wenn er zur eigenen Strategie passt oder sehr günstig ist.

I don't get why everyone loves this game so much.  It's cute and easy to learn, but not much else.

My feeling was that there was always one obvious best choice on a given person's turn.  The variability was in the luck of what money/tiles were available rather than in player strategy choices.

The theme is also tacked-on.  I know, Eurogame blah blah, but since I found it lacking in strategic challenge, it's too bad the theme couldn't pick up the slack.

I'm hanging on to it because I know plenty of people who would like a game that doesn't require much decision.  It's a good "gateway drug" in that sense.  But personally, I won't be playing it much.

This game is easy to learn, and in essence quite light, but also quite challenging to play well.  The latter is basically due to the luck element which plays a big role.

The Good:  Good strategy game, but not too heavy for the family to enjoy. Good tough decisions to be made. The two player variant is actually very good.

The Bad: Plays very differently with 2 than with 5. More players makes it more difficult to plan ahead. Be aware that this is not a quick filler game (at least on the first play), as it took us 2 hours with 3 new players. However, the time does drop somewhat with experienced players.

I enjoy this game when I get the chance to play it.  It is fairly random, with some interesting tactical decisions to be made.  It becomes more random (annoyingly so) with 5+ players, so I recommend only playing it with 2-4.  Reasonably easy to learn, and fun for non-gamers or casual gamers. See my full review.

Occasionally choppy, but really a lovely game.  I'm looking forward to RGG publishing the 3 additional expansions and getting them to the distributors in the next week or two.  The modular nature of the game is very appealing in a way similar to Carcassonne, though I do reach for ths one first.

Certainly a solataire element exists, as each player builds their own Alhambra separate from the other players', but to win you really need to pay attention to which colors the other players are collecting (both money and cards). Pleasant to look at, and pleasant to play.

I have always wanted to learn and play this game!  I was excited when I was able to!  A straight forward tile placement game with interesting buying and auction mechanics.  You never know when you will be scoring points in a round, the tension of a round ending is always there!  "Do I buy that building, and do I have exact change to buy it so I could have another full turn?"  Scoring is easy to figure out, and get better over time.  Although this was only my first game, all three of us were ten points apart!  Granted I probably didn't use certain actions when I should up but, it's ok!  A great game!

It’s a good two-player game. But the game gets a little too chaotic with more than two players. With more than two players it basically becomes almost impossible to have any strategy towards trying to buy the right buildings since everybody will be buying everything that they can afford. So with multiple players the game becomes a simple slugfest.

Full of agonizing decisions, and full of beautiful bits. This was an instant winner in our household, and has been well-received by non-gaming extended family members. It has the right blend of randomness and strategic planning for my taste. It can be tense on almost every turn. It works better for 2-3 players- at 4, you spend too much time studying tiles and cards that won't likely be available on your next turn, and waiting patiently while someone else agonizes over what to do. I like it best for 2 (with the 3rd dummy player- usually Kipper, our cat who likes to try stealing the score markers/napping on my wife's palace complex).

I rate the original Stimmt So! a bit higher as I find that the tile-laying in Alhambra obscures rather than enhances the clean core system.

Played it once so far. Was a nice game.

You can buy tiles and build your city. There are always 4 tiles to buy and after one was bought, another one is added from the tile-deck. So you never know which tiles are coming. Other players will buy tiles that yourself would like to have.

I think there are also some great expansions that add lots of possibilities and replay value.

The artwork is ok, could be a little better maybe. I'd say if they would release it in 2016 they would make it a little better, since nowadays lots of games have awesome artwork and components. But it is from 2003 where players were used to common medium artwork.

Even though the multi-turn auctions can be considered resource management, with players choosing whether a tile is 'worth it'.

A nice and easy majority scoring game, great gateway. Though it's simple, the building puzzle can become tricky and the endgame feels usually quite tight.

...with 2, which gets a little boring. Boring but better than the overly chaotic 4-player game. I will never try this with 5, 3 could be the balanced sweet spot. We shall see.

-----

Best with 2 or 3, yes. But the two sub-games feel like they don't really come together as a whole, and the game just isn't particularly interesting. This won't get played enough to be a keeper, I'll get to play it anyway if I really happen to feel like it at some point.

The rules are pretty simple, so it's easy to learn, and easy to teach games newbies. It's a little bit too random to earn a higher score, and the fact that stuff that you buy (buildings) don't give you abilities in any way is kind of unfortunate, but if you pick up the Big Box that contains all five expansions (each "expansion" is actually like four separate modules), there will be enough material to keep the game fresh for years.

A very good game that runs smoothly. It is perfect to play with your spouses and girlfriends (if you are male of course). It has strategic options but a lot of luck is involved, something that is not neccesary a bad thing. Generally the game is fun (and for me this is that matters the most.)

P.S. My girlfriend always beats me. :)

A tile-laying game with a twist! You have to purchase your desired tiles with the correct type of currency before you can lay them down--as long as you opponents don't buy them first.

decent game, but if i were to play a 'buy tiles and place them' game i'd much rather play vegas showdown. the exact change rule is interesting, but i don't see how it makes any sense thematically. wouldn't the builders be more willing to build you another building if you paid them more than the base price instead of paying exact change?

In Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex.

On a player's turn, a player may take money from the open money market, purchase a building from the building market, or engage in construction and re-construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player's reserve. The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn.

Players with the most buildings in each of the six building types score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players' longest external "wall" section within their complex. The game ends when the building market can no longer be replenished from the building tile supply, and there is a final scoring, whereupon the player with the highest score wins.

The game is not so bad and it might actually get better with expansions I never tried. Since on my point of view, there is something spice missing to the game. The feeling of the game seems to go more toward intuition than strategy.

I thought this was just merely okay and wouldn't want to play it with more than four players.  But, now with the expanion set(s), the game play it more dynamic and improved significantly overall.

RATING: 4
A játék jó, gondolkodós, de több dolog is akad benne, ami nem tetszik. Egyrészt, hogy mintha nem lenne elég interakció benne, mert mi szinte szótlanul játszottuk végig. Igaz, közben végig nagyon gondolkodva, hogy mit is érdemes csinálni, szóval nem unatkozva szótlanul, hanem a gondolkodásba elmerülten szótlanul. Aztán szerintem hátrány az is, hogy bár a kézben lévő lapok elvileg titkosak, de ha valaki jegyzi, akkor mégis tudhatja őket, hiszen látja, hogy ki milyen lapot húz fel vagy dob el. A játék maga nagyon egyszerű, és elég jó is, épp kellő mélységű ahhoz, hogy kellemes legyen: sem túl felületes, sem nem veszik el a szabályok bonyolult útvesztőjében. A játékelemek kidolgozottsága majdnem kiváló, csak egy bajom van vele: a barna és a lila lapok színe túl hasonló, nehéz őket egyetlen pillantással megkülönböztetni.

Update: A negyedik játéknál már tökéletesen ismerve és alkalmazva a szabályokat eljutottam oda, hogy ráérezzek a játék ízére. Tetszik, szívesen játszom vele! 7.2 -> 7.4 pont.

Update2: Annyira nagyon azért nem jó ez a játék, legalábbis két játékossal. Oké, figyelni kell arra, hogy minél több épülettípusból nekem legyen a legtöbb, vagy legalább egálban legyek valakivel, meg hogy a falam is szép hosszú legyen, esetleg hogy mások elől elhúzzam a számukra értékes épületeket, és hiába tűnik ez épp elégnek, de a játékosok között még sincs direkt interakció, gyakorlatilag szótlanul, mechanikusan le lehet játszani az egészet.
Több játékos esetén már nagyobb lehet a harc az épülettípusokban többséget szerzésért, ugyanakkor mire rám kerülne ismét a sor, már jó eséllyel felhúznák a kiszemelt épületet, szóval a tervezhetősége meg csökkenne. 7.4 -> 7.1 pont.

Update3: Nagyon hiányzik a direkt interakció a játékból. Nem lenne rossz, de ezt túl súlyos hibának érzem, egyszerűen nem elnézhető. 7.1 -> 6.6 pont.

Update4: mégis szép emlékként él bennem a játék: 6.6 -> 6.8 pont.

Update5: Újrapontozom a játékokat aszerint, hogy melyikkel mennyire szívesen játszanék mondjuk ma este. Ez alapján: 4

I think base Alhambra is OK, but there's just too much randomness... It's fun though, but I wouldn't recommend it for "gamers" with other player-count than 3.

RATING: 7
This is a nice gateway game.  It feels a little like a cross between [GAMEID=9209] (in the money selection option) and [GAMEID=822] (in the tile placement), but introduced some new elements as well.  The wall bonus was also clever---it was important to build the longest wall to get points, but it was self-balancing since you could very easily cut yourself off and prevent any further expansion.  

It was also a great two player game.  We actually recently played it with three and actually preferred the two player game.  Unlike a lot of multiplayer games that also work with two, [GAMEID=6249] is the rare game that has [i]more[/i] strategy in the two player game.  Although much maligned, the dummy player Dirk works brilliantly.  He's not really a true player---think of him as a new away to affect the other player by serving as a tile dump.  For example, to prevent your opponent from getting second place points, you could buy Dirk tiles to move them down to third place.  The random tiles that Dirk gets also serves to slightly randomize the game to keep you on your feet on what the more valuable tile distributions are.  In fact, we found that the two player game without Dirk was almost broken---at one point I had already bought the majority of purple tiles, so it was pointless for me to buy any others.  Similarly, it was pointless for my girlfriend to buy any more purple tiles since she was guaranteed second place.  Guess what was available in the quarry?  Four purple tiles.  In contrast, the existence of Dirk would provide tension for whether she would get the second or third place points.  In addition, the [i]point differential[/i] between any of the colored tiles was the same, so in the zero sum two player game, it just didn't matter which colors you got, just as long as you had the majority in more of them.  With Dirk, it's totally different.

With more players, I can see how the game would bog down and get too chaotic since to form any long term strategy.  Probably best with two.

Funny, unlike [GAMEID=822], we really haven't had the urge to try any of the expansions...

Alhambra is a nice relaxing euro.
It's one of those games that I don't mind playing if someone else suggests it, but it lacks that "oomph" that would make me want to play it.
There is little player interaction apart from the  occasional "Hey I wanted that!!" but that is to be expected. It's a nice, well-rounded game, and my only issue with it is that i think the first player advantage is a bit too severe.

So many good things about this game. It's light enough that you can still banter around the table while you play but even so it still has plenty of depth to it. Plays well anywhere from 2 to 6, though 6 CAN get a bit slow at times but that's where the allowance for chatter comes in and helps. I also really like Matt, the imaginary 3rd player in a 2 player game. Nothing is quite as satisfying as winning when your opponent loses 2nd place to Matt. ;)

For me, this game is mostly about managing your money -- You can aim for lots of free turns (by getting lots of the same currency, making exact payment easier), or go for flexibility in buying from different piles. And there are trade-offs between grabbing the first available exact buy, or waiting for a carefully chosen purchase (though the former usually seems to be the way to go).  I don’t yet really understand how to arrange the walls well, but seem to do okay at it, anyhow.

I've only played this on BSW, and it was the third BSW game that I learned.  When I first played it, I thought it was a nice blend of strategy and fun, you know, decent filler.  Over time, though, it has just slid down my list of games that I want to play.  I've just learned more games that are the same weight but seem to be more rewarding such as Ra, St. Petersburg or Sticheln.  I now haven't played it in months.

UPDATE: Now that this is no longer on BSW, I doubt I'll ever play it again.

UPDATE: A friend got this for Christmas unexpectedly, returning it to my gaming consciousness. It even seems to be a bit better than I remembered it as being. Probably best with 4, with the chaos level growing rapidly out of hand above that.

Not my thing, per se, but better than average.

UPDATE: Ahhhhhhhh! [i]There's[/i] the annoying screwage by random factors that I remember. Down a point. Inoffensive, but rather too long for what it is.

UPDATE: Burning out on this rapidly. It's in heavy rotation, and much loved by the rest of my (small) game group. I have to admit that I really want the new game shine to wear off before I am permanently soured on it. 4, at least for now.

Pretty simple to learn and I like that the multiple dimensions to think about through the interweaving of wanting majority of certain building colors, the wall bonuses, and trying to chain card drafting set collection. The two scoring periods throughout the game and that things don't refill till the end of the turn also makes it feel like you can't just hoard cards like crazy and basically split the game into two halves, as can sometimes be the issue of ticket to ride against new players. However, I didn't like how tactical the game felt, with the board states that are shared by players (tiles to be bought and cards to be drafted) possibly completely changed by the time it gets back to your turn. Because of that, I can't imagine playing this with more than 3.

I go back and forth about how much I like this game. I always enjoy it, but sometimes I think it’s a 9 and other times I think it’s a 6. I got the Big Box at Origins 2014 without ever having played it, and that was a good choice (though I have yet to play more than 1 of the expansions).

This is Pimp Yo Palace. Basically, there are a bunch of different kinds of rooms (gardens, arcades, etc), and you stop three times to calculate points. On your turn, you can buy room and take money; if you use exact change to purchase a room, you can take another action. You get the bulk of your points from having the most of a type of room, but you also get points for the longest consecutive wall.

2 (Extremely annoying and won't play again).  Too bad the beautiful components and classy presentation couldn't save this one for me.  Yet another game that makes me feel like I'm crunching numbers or doing my taxes.  I didn't like it after my first play, hated it on my second.  There was not, and will not be, a third.

Lightweight and straightforward to play, good for when you don't want to think too hard, but want some amount of challenge.  Becomes increasingly chaotic with more players - would not want to repeat the 5 or 6 player game - but with less players, some degree of control over your fate is possible.

A nice, fun game, though the industry seems to have passed it by a little.  I find it hard to get excited about these days, not that I ever got that excited about it in its "prime."  Should probably give it another try with more players; most of mine were with 2-3.

Awesome little Euro that plays great for 2-4 players. I think 5 players may be a bit much as it's hard to get any progress going before the game is over. The theme is pasted on, but the tiles and the mechanics do enough to keep players interested for the duration of the game. Highly recommended as a light weight Eurogame.

Tile laying.  There's a central market where you buy you and other players buy tiles, that gets randomly refilled as tiles get purchased.  Hand management, where your hand represents different forms of non-exchangeable currency to buy tiles, based on where they are in the market board.  Typical euro "scoring rounds" every so often.  Each player manages their own private tile area, but shares the central market.

The luck of the currency draw has screwed me on more than one occasion... other than that a solid game.

This is a great game to play when you are looking for something fairly light.  Individual turns are (should be) very quick.  Downtime can be a problem with more than 4 players.  I liken it somewhat to a combination of Ticket to Ride (the actions available each turn) and Union Pacific (the method of scoring).  You'd think it was an Alan Moon game, but not.

RATING: 8
Huge two player hit.  14 plays in the first two weeks after we got it.  Had to put it away just so we wouldn't wear it out.

Also a big 3 and 4 player hit, especially with the family.  Short enough to pull out and play once, but tends to get played two or three times in a row. Strategic enough to keep me interested, but enough luck to keep less hard core gamers into it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
2/2006: Mechanically this felt like a predecessor to UnionPacific - not vice versa.  In my first game with 5 players downtime was a real annoying problem.  One cannot really start planning anything until the player to your right starts his turn; and any strategy of planning ahead seems impossible. Which highlights the games second largest problem: luck and randomness of available tiles/cards.
Will try this again with fewer players (3?) which might reduce some of the problems mentioned.

RATING: 7.2
Interesting game with several mechanisms from tile-laying and majority control to hand management and guessing what opponents will do. Play with too many and it gets chaotic.

This is a fun, light game that is easy to teach, and introduces a number of concepts from more complex Euros. It really doesn't work well with more than 4 players though, and despite claims to the contrary, I don't think the expansions fix that. It's also NOT colourblind friendly, which is a problem for some people that we play with.

Zu Anfang des Spiels hat jeder nur einen Brunnen (das Startplättchen) vor sich liegen. Weitere Anbauten müssen erst gekauft und gebaut werden. 
Wer an der Reihe ist, kann eine der folgenden Aktionen wählen: 
1.) Geld nehmen
2.) Ein Gebäude kaufen
3.) Ein Gebäude umbauen
Alhambra ist recht einfach zu spielen. Man kann, muss es aber nicht, mit viel Taktik spielen. Es macht aber auch Spaß, wenn man nicht viel plant, sondern einfach nur versucht, einen schönen Plast zu bauen.

[2-6] A nice game to play with new gamers. Works with 6 players too, but every player after the third increaces randomness. Might get past that with some house rules (a small queue of tiles for each currency or something?), haven't tried yet.

Not a lot of player interaction, pretty good though for the style of game that it is.  Seems that it would have more interesting gameplay at 2-3 players but this usually gets played with 4+ players and the board shifts enough between turns that it's hard to play tactically.

Right now, this is very high on our list. It has much of the same draw for us as Battle Line - you need to manage multiple items at once, it has a great balance of luck and strategy, and it is fast paced. It plays OK with two people, but plays better with a third real person. With four, it gets a bit frustrating - nothing ever seems to remain available once the other three players have a chance to buy tiles. We got the initial expansion pack to try out.

great game
you build your own area but you score purely vs everyone else.

two players can play with no change but it is clearly more fun with three, I'd add a point or two to my rating if you play with more than two players

Tiene decisiones raras: le va mejor al jugador que por pagar en cantidad exacta la ficha a jugar, obtiene un turno más (que le permite o ganar $$, o jugar otra ficha, o reacomodar su puzzle).
Veremos como evoluciona en otros juegos y pondré nueva puntuación, de merecerlo.
OCTUBRE 2005: mejor impresión, pero el ranking sigue siendo 7.

This game is great for times when I don't want to think too much about my moves and also works very well with new gamers.  I think it still holds up after all these years, and I still enjoy the art, the decisions (light though they are), and the puzzle.

I do enjoy this game.  I can't think of any other game that it would remind me of.  I like the tile/town building mechanic that feels a bit like a solo play of Carcasonne.  And I like the money grab at each round that allows you to purchase those tiles.

I think the only gripe I have about this game is that it doesn't feel very balanced.  Experienced players generally have a hand up and there's very little in the way of moderators to make sure those who are behind catch up.

3 plays, 4, 5 and 6 players.  6 is too much luck, 5 was better, but 4 was best. The scoring rules are a bit confusing (especially for ties) and there is little you can do to directly affect another player.  Still, an enjoyable game that offers some challenge.

It feels like an awkward version of ticket to ride.

You are collecting sets of cards to buy buildings.  Problem is, buildings are randomized so you can easily buy a building only to give someone else a freebie due to a circumstance completely out of your control.

Sad thing is I usually enjoy set collecting games, but I felt with all these random elements that I was just along for the ride instead of planning anything of value unlike Ticket to Ride.

Played this 4 times--once with a group of four who aborted when "Railroad Tycoon" arrived, and once with a friend.  The game lasted three hours, because I'd forgotten to institute the "Matt" rule, which creates a third "dummy" player who gets dealt six tiles each round and scores them at the end of the round as if he'd placed them legally.  In addition, you take one of each money card out of the deck to cut the overall length by a third.  Finally played a proper 2-player with my brother.  Worked out well.  I'll fold in the expansions in the future.

RATING: 7.5
Easy, fun, mostly light. It didn't take too long to understand why it's a SdJ winner. Probably deserves more attention as a 'gateway' game as it's easy enough that you could play with the kids and grandparents, but definitely not something people unfamiliar with euros will find new and different.

Now, gotta decide which expansions to buy...

I enjoyed this the first time I played it, but liked it less the second time. It's not a bad game, and the mechanics for scoring and earning bonus actions are excellent (as are the quality of the pieces and the novelty of the theme) -- it's just not interactive enough for me.

There's very little you can do to impact anyone else's game (apart from buying something you know they need, which is easier said than done), which isn't an automatic dealbreaker for me but does bug me in this case. On top of that, it's almost impossible to plan for your next turn -- what's available is almost certain to change before then. That's a bad combination.

I didn't see this coming out much except as an intro game for non-boardgamers, where I think it would serve quite nicely -- then I just never saw it come out at all, so I sold it.

First two games have been quite interesting.  Hoping for more in the coming weeks.  A nice quick and fun game.  Rating will likely move up to an  8.  Played another 3-player game - I like this game more each time I play it.  Need to get another 4-player in at some point.

I continue to enjoy this game.  Light, with some decisions.  Good one to play with my wife who doesn't care for games with much conflict or blocking, etc.

This is a terrific family game or gateway game. It's not very good at two players though. You use a dummy player, which I am not a big fan of. It's fun building your own little tile city, but can be frustrating watching other players grab tiles you desperately need while you wait for your turn.

I like the exact change mechanic that gives you an extra turn, it's pretty light and makes a good gateway game. But at its core its essentially a majority controlling game where you want to have the most buildings of each color, and you score based on if you have more than your opponents in each of the color categories.. Which is why it kinda falls flat for me, that's not really that exciting. And the game seems to drag on a bit for me. but a good gateway game.

RATING: 4
2 / 5 - Fair.

I played this with six players, which doesn't really showcase the game well, I think. I can imagine it'd be an acceptable Euro with 3 or 4. It's dry and a bit "heads-down" and the theme is utterly ridiculous (yes, I'll just store this building plus walls here in my shed until I need it). But on the other hand there's enough variation and randomness to keep you on your toes, and there's a lot of factors to balance off some pretty intuitive rules.

Enjoyed the game. First played at KublaStaffCon. Doug Garrett and Anthony Gallela had slightly different takes on how the game was played.

Didn't matter to me. I played with Doug, Karen and another player. The game was enjoyable. Karen seemed to enjoy it as well. She gave the game another try that weekend.

She recalls not liking it. Huh. Bummer. 

I'd like to play this again and potentially add it to the collection.

After 1 play (base game only): Simple game that would definitely fit into the "Gateway"category. We played wrong our first time and didn't score the longest wall each round. The basic strategy is rather obvious, and the game ended relatively close. There is a good amount of luck (right buildings/money coming up at the right time) and a small amount of interactiveness.

We're really enjoying this based on our first few plays -- the combination of different currency, limited tile choices and the building rules makes for interesting decisions each turn, and it moves quickly enough that there's not much down time.  I think the 2-player variation works pretty well, although I'm sure it would be better with more real players instead of "Matt."

Too simple, too much downtime, too much luck involved, and with slower players the fun per playing time ratio is very low.

Buying buildings with equal amount of money is like getting them for free. If your money just doesn't fit you'll be pissed like you'll be while playing Catan when dice aren't favourable.

Quite horrible, totally overrated, but will play when there's no better games available - just because other people like it. Yuck!

I really enjoyed this game-a lot of interesting elements going on here, from collecting coin cards to spend, and the fun of trying to sweep multiple pieces at once with 'exact change' before an opponent buys just the tile you wanted, to trying to stay ahead in various tile colors to earn the highest bonus, to placing the tiles correctly to maximize the length of your wall as well as to allow expansion with new bought tiles, while following all the rules about placement.  I liked it enough to go ahead and order the Big Box.  Also gave me a chance to go back and play the Alcazaba variant of the dice version (I played the dice game before this one).  This one's definitely a keeper, one of my highest rated games in my collection.

Amazed and overjoyed that my young kids picked this game up. Seeing them start to form basic strategies was so awesome to see.

I love that this game has versatility. I can play with the kids, and I can play with my friends, and enjoy it differently but equally. It's gone over well when I taught people who have never played this game. 

It's "thinky" without getting too bogged down. 

I have yet to try the expansions. I feel the base game still has life, but it's definitely nice to know there is room to grow and move up or move on from the original form because there are so many expansions available!

One of my favorite games. Mainly because my wife likes it. It plays in a decent time frame, the base version is easy enough to teach, the randomness allows for options and no dominant person/strategy, and the components and rulebook are nice. I like the scoring options and variable scoring round triggers. The game has tough decisions but can also have luck. 

The base game is great, but the expansions are fun too, and not expensive. If you like the expansions, go for the big box to save money. Then watch Dice Tower review series on the expansion to see which to bother with. 

It’s a quiet, fun game with no conflict (you’re building a garden after all) that plays multiple people well. The theme gets buried a little bit but I love that it’s not just another “push the cubes around”.

This one is just OK for me and my wife. I feel it is rather bland, with little or no player interaction. Players take turns taking one of 4 currencies, or using those currencies to buy buildings in attempt to hold a majority at the end of each of 3 rounds. This isn't a bad game by any means, I just have more enjoyable games that beat this one out of the running for lots of play-time. Still, I enjoy pulling this one out once in a while for a light game.

This has been a great gateway game for me, especially with the female relatives. Introduced mother and aunt over thanksgiving, and sister-in-law over chrismas -- in a game where my mother pwned us both. Must be something about the gardens that is appealing. A bit of luck involved, crimped in the last game because the pieces I needed kept ending up on the orange market tile, and no orange money was coming up to pick. I think I'll be aquiring the expansion that adds the ability to pay for things with different currancy. They may also breathe a little new life into the game. Highly recommended for 2 to 3 players.

Language independent.

I purchased the Big Box edition, which contains all 5 expansions.

Feels like 2 parts Palazzo, 1 part Galaxy Trucker (ship creation without the real time aspect).  Comparing base games, I think Palazzo is deeper, but Alhambra has much more longevity due to expansions (adds luck, hidden info, more ways to score).

Easy to learn during one play, even with Dirk (fake 3rd player).

In [i]Alhambra[/i], each player builds his or her own, well, Alhambra.  To do so, one must purchase a series of tiles using the appropriate currency.  There are four different types of currency, which are obtained by drawing cards.  Each tile has a color, number and wall configuration.  

Scoring is achieved in two ways, as follows, and is done at three times during the game:

(1) Number of tiles in a particular color (if tied, the tiebreaker is the sum of the numbers on the tiles)

(2) Building a castle with a long continuous wall (you receive a point for each section of the wall)

Conflict in this game is for the most part indirect.  You are constantly comparing your Alhambra to that of your opponents to determine which color(s) you should be pursuing.  Also, you are trying to acquire these tiles in a way such that their walls fit into the configuration of your Alhambra.  At times, you will take certain cards/tiles to block your opponents, but doing so too often will hamper you from building your own Alhambra.

I suspect most will enjoy this as a family type game with 3-4 players.  The two-player variant is more cut throat.  It involves a dummy player who automatically receives tiles at certain intervals.  Also, players may purchase and strategically give tiles to the dummy (you may do this if, for instance, you are easily winning a category and you want your opponent to come in third).  I enjoy the two-player variant, but it definitely feels like a last minute add-on rather than the true vision of the game.

I can see the appeal for this to win the SdJ.  I think I prefer the simplicity of Stimmt So.  The wall tiles add a bit more depth but I am not sure they are necessary.  The game is quite luck dependent - if you get some poor tiles during your turn you can be left in the dust.

06/30/04 Received. I've played with 2, 3, 4 and 5. Two-player is horrid. Three-player is great. I would think with 6 you'd need a very big table. I own the Uberplay version, bought in June 2004. And I *really* appreciate the names on the tiles and money cards. Its too bad that all fell by the wayside when RGG took over producing it and the expansions in 2005. Phooey on "language neutral"!
07/15/15 It took me until today to finally play a six player game! 11/14/16 Finally played another one! 
As of 01/10/18 I've played Alhambra 64+ times. About 40% of those were with expansion modules.

Interesting concept. Easy to pick up. And very colorful and pleasant game pieces. Basically, it's a game of decision. You decide if you want to buy something or get more money. You try to get monopoles on building types and long exterior walls. I like that game, not agressive, each player play is own turn, no one can interfer. But when it's your turn again to play, things might have changed and you might have to use a new strategy. Castle building puts more impact on strategic decision. Nice game,   I think my family will enjoy that one a lot! Played it with 5 players, 4 is definetely better.

I love the balance in the game with 2 to 4 players (and with my kids when we have a total of 5 players, it's still really good).  Everyone feels in the game up until the end because it's very tactical, but good strategy throughout definitely pays off.  I always like a game where you get to build things and compare them to others so it feels like you've accomplished something interesting even if you're in last place.

Fun, lighter game, which is probably best with 4 people.  While there is some strategy to it, it's easy enough for casual gamers to pick up on and thus makes for a great intro/gateway game.  There's enough randomness to keep the game interesting throughout and to make sure that each game plays out differently without taking too much away from the development of a strategy.  It definitely loses some entertainment as the number of players increase, but I feel the basic premise of the game works very well.  Games are often tight and no one usually feels like they've played poorly.

I don't love this game, but there's a lot to like.  Not much direct interaction, but turns move fairly quickly.  I like that there's not much hidden information in terms of scoring, other than the randomness of the scoring rounds.  Working out the best tile placement is a fun puzzle and trying to plan ahead hoping the tile you want to buy survives until the next round adds some good suspense.  I've played with several of the expansions and while they're interesting, I have no problem playing the simple vanilla base game.  Solid euro and fairly easy to bring new players into, but I could see it being a bit dull to non-gamers.  Probably a safe bet if you like Carcassonne.

Slightly more engaging than Go Fish. Granted, I generally hate tile placement games, but I took zero satisfaction in winning this one. Oh, I won because I had the right money when the right wall tiles were available on my turn? Yay. This must appeal to those who want to sit around a table with friends but don't want to think. I like sitting with friends, too, but I can do it without a mechanical bore of a game lying on the table.

A game of area control, resource management, and building. Use your numbered cards to bid on numbered tiles of different colors. If you pay "exact change," you get to take another turn of either collecting bidding cards or bidding on a tile again. If you overpay, you end your turn right there. If you cannot buy any tiles, you just collect more cards. The goal is to try to become first place in each color while using the tiles to build a palace. (Each tile has walls on them so you must configure your palace so that you can move freely from room to room). Takes about 15 minutes to explain. Three rounds of scoring with the first place getting cummulatively higher on each scoring round.  Simple enough to teach non-gamers but complex enough to hold the interest of gamers (well, most of them!). Fun, overall game that combines bidding, resource management, and a little bit of luck in what cards you draw.

I think the "third" player works extremely well in the two-player game. I really like this.

I don't win at this game. I don't know why that is. Others I play with really attempt to maximize their wall from the beginning; maybe I should put more effort into that.

Pleasant enough game.  Easy to play, a bit challenging to manage the walls correctly (I didn't do well).  Plays pretty fast.  the selection mechanic between choosing money and buying stuff is a really good one, and allowing multimoves when paying exact change is also an excellent concept.  The most difficult thing for new players is the concept that the color of buildings has nothong to do with the color of the money used.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I liked it OK, but I felt that the money mechanic didn't feel very cohesive with the building city mechanic. It feels like two different games in one. I think that getting exact change is too prone to luck to make it a serious tactical game. If I want to build a city, I think I'd rather play Carcassonne. If I want to draw tiles, I'd prefer Ra.

Plays best with 4.

Clever tile-laying game.  I really liked the idea that players draft the money used to pay for building tiles.  The money comes in different colours that match the tiles and when a tile is bought with exact change an extra turn is used.  Each player builds off of their own Alhambra where bonuses and restrictions apply to tile-placement.  A very fun game and highly recommended if you enjoy drafting like I do.

This is a fun "stock" collecting game.  Most people wouldn't categorize it as collecting stocks, but I think that is clearly what the main goal of the game.  When the first scoring round comes up you have to have the majority in a type of tile, on the second, you need to be first or second, and at the end of the game the top 3 are rewarded.  If you aren't scoring majority in some of the tile types you aren't going to win.  That is why I consider it a stock game.

The other aspect of this game that makes it interesting is that you have to be able to build your Alhambra (I think that was a city in Spain) in such a way that the tiles you buy can be added on.  If you buy a tile and can't add it, you don't get credit for it.  The tiles have sides with or without walls which makes things tricky at times.  You also get points for the longest wall you create.

This game gets worse as you add people.  With all 6 players the tiles you saw at the end of your turn will most likely be all different on your next turn.  Then it turns into more of a timing game, if the right tile comes up on my turn I'll do well, if not I lose.  I think 3 players is the best for this game.  The 2 player game has a good mechanic by adding a 3rd phantom player.  This player gets a pretty even number of tiles and jumps into his place for majorities in scoring rounds, but doesn't score walls.  He usually doesn't win, and probably should be in last place every time, but he does add a good twist that would otherwise ruin the 2 player game.  If you are playing with more players, especially 5 or 6, get the vizier's favor expansion.  That can help break up the timing factor, but I would still recommend playing with 3.

I gave this game an 8 because I enjoy playing it, with 3 players (sometimes 4), and I would never turn down a game if offered.  I enjoy building up my Alhambra as well as having to pay attention to the tiles others are collecting.

Moderate tile-laying game where players are building on individual player boards. There are score bonuses for collecting the most X type of buildings, longest wall, etc. The same bonuses are scored 3 times per game, so dominating one area ends up in steamrolling scores.

Odd mechanic is the ability to purchase extra cards if you pay with exact change. In the 6P game we played, the ability to "plan" to use exact change to get an extra action seemed very arbitrary, and very strong.

Decent enough for a tile-laying game, but might bug heavier gamers.

Épület lapkákat vásárolunk a kínálatból, majd pedig beépítjük az Alhambránkba az építési szabályok figyelembevételével. 3 értékelés fázis van a játékban, amikor is pontokat kapunk a különböző színű épületekért és a városfal hosszáért. Az a játékos kapja a legtöbb pontot egy adott színért, akinek a legtöbb ilyen színű épülete van az Alhambrájában.

Really want to get more plays of this. I understand its detractors that it is too much AP for what it is, too tactical, too random. Yet there is a certain beauty to your creation. Also the balance of raw purchasing power ("give me the big monies") versus the advantages of exact change ("give me multiple small monies and extra turns please") make for meaningful decisions even on turns you have seemingly nothing productive to do. Affordability, color, and wall configuration are all factors in your decisions, and each of those has subjective value depending on your current configuration and that of your opponents.

Does this building fit? Will it add to your wall score? Does it change the color majority? Will it give you a bonus turn? Is it worth taking into your reserve just to keep someone else from getting it? Will it still be there next turn? How close is the next scoring or the end of the game?

Chaos rises with the player count. Those who found the game too luck-based at 5 or 6 players should try it with 3 or 4. Commit to fast turns and I think this is a fun one.

I'm usually not too fond of eurogames, but this is quite good. The randomness of the buildings on offer is really what makes this game, as it allows a lot of strategizing over what seems to be a simple design.

Rating for Anniversary Edition.

Scales nicely from 2-4 people but is better with 3-4. (sorry invisible Dirk).  Solid without any of the expansions but there are some excellent expansions.  Upgrade in rating for the Gold Anniversary Edition which adds the game board and brings back the tile names.  The bigger size box is nice if you want to take some expansions with you.  In fact, I stowed away the inserts and boxes and put all the expansions in the main box. Some people may balk at the number and 'usefulness' of the expansions but in this case, some of them can tweak the game in all the right ways and even make the 5 and 6 player games viable.  

note: gave this 2005 copy to M&W

RATING: 6
Probably not so much a "bad" game as an "annoying" game in that I could never figure out how to do any better than utterly mediocre at this.  I don't think I'm very good at spatial exercises and this game demands that you come up with some method to your tile-laying madness.  Yes, there is an action that allows you to recreate your alhambra, but take that too many times and you fall hopelessly behind someone who figures out their configuration the first time around.  I'm not above getting rid of decent games that I simply don't enjoy (or keeping mediocre games that I do enjoy) and this is probably one such example.

The base game is simple and easy to grok.  The Big Box version (which my more recent experience is with) I've tried the addition of wilds (which doesn't seem to change the game meaningfully but introduced a touch more luck) and change (Which also didn't seem to change the game much, but was also fiddly).  I prefer the base game to both of those variants.

One of these Games with good design and the manual makes you believes you have a great Game with low luck and plenty of Tactics. After my play I liked it, after several plays my rating went down about one note per session. If all the interaction should build out of "i buy a card that my coplayer might want", then it´s way to less for my taste. Maybe better with the expansion but I refused to try until now.

Very much enjoy the majority scoring mechanism and the tension that brings (also not knowing exactly when the rounds end).  Can be a bit hard to plan ahead for your turn as someone might take the card/tile you want, so that can sometimes make the game take longer than it should.  Very simple gameplay, nice gateway-style game, overall like a lot.  Would love to try expansions for it to mix things up though.

Vágod, mi az az Alhambra? Na, ha nem, először Wikipedia, aztán megveheted. :0)

Tipikus családi játék, kevés konflikttal, ám de néhány ötletes mechanizmussal, mint például a piac vagy maga az építkezés.

Belépő szintnek is elmegy, de kicsit azért annál komolyabb (nem kell megijedni, nem nagyon).

Ha meg már unalmas az alapjáték (újrajátszhatósága mondjuk kb. végtelen, az unalmas inkább arra vonatkozik, hogy hiányzik még belőle valami csavar, akár egy új mechanizmus), van hozzá rengeteg kiegészítő is, amik közül modulárisan akár egy-kettő beépítésével is lehet fokozni a kombinációs lehetőségeket. De vigyázat! Ha mindent beleteszünk, igazi agyégetős analízis-paralízis csata válhat belőle, ami nem mindenkinek a kedvenc időtöltése (euro fanok előnyben).

Vannak hasonlóságai a Carcassonne-nal: lapka lehelyezés, a Ticket to Ride-dal: pénzkártyák (amik ott ugye vonatok és nem épületeket lehet velük vásárolni, hanem útvonalat). Meg még valószínűleg több másik játékkal is.

Our first play left a very good impression on my wife and I. After a few plays, we really like this one. Even if I don't win at it. Ever.

I'm a little bit on the fence about this one. I like the mechanic of choosing whether to take money or buy a tile, and of getting an extra action for paying with exact change. I enjoy building a city and trying to line up the walls efficiently. The end product somehow feels like less than the sum of its parts to me.

I'm curious how it plays with more than 2 players.

I see they have a Big Box version of Alhambra with all 5 expansions for about 50 bucks. Want this.

Really like this game and the randomness at which the tiles come out of the bag.  It definitely has a very specific player count. 2 player is ok, and maybe with a few house rules will make it better, and 6 player creates a hurry up and wait feeling.  At 6 there is also very little to no strategy, you might as well wait until it is actually your turn to make any purchasing decisions. 4 player is okay, but would like to play it at the recommended 3 player. I also will update more after playing with a couple expansions.

The tiles were cut a bit 'off' in the version I got from Amazon. Big kudos to the company -- they sent me new ones, all the way from Germany.

By the time they arrived, however, my interest in the game had sort of passed. I'd gotten this game to possibly play during a trip to Spain (and the Alhambra). 

It's a pretty game, and I like the concept. Some of the rules weren't totally clear, and I had to fudge my way through with friends. Might try again... and might not.

My wife's favourite game, along with Caylus. Easy to learn, quick to play, and attractive to look at.

Oddly, I like it much better with 2, because there's more opportunity to plan ahead. With 4 or more, the tile selection is different every time the turn comes back around.

I'm curious what the expansions do to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Just a bit too much luck in the game. Four types of money and even more buildings give to much possibilities to develop your own game and restrict the need for player interaction. Perhaps playing with less buildings and less types of money makes this game more interesting. It will also cut in the time it takes.
UPDATE: Playing with less players helped out a lot. Updated the scoring.

This was a birthday gift to Mrs Fish last year but one that, for a variety of reasons, has languished unplayed for more than a few months. This changed recently when she decided it was high time we gave it a play.  Well, we have only played two players so far and it is a reasonably enjoyable light euro. The game itself is solid enough and the unpredictability about when scoring will occur makes for some interesting decisions.  It’s early days in out A career, but this is one I can see that will get a lot of play, and one I’d be keen to try with more than two where, I suspect, it will shine.

Received the original printing version of this game in a game exchange.  I screwed up every aspect of scoring my first time playing this but it held up well when we replayed it properly.

I resisted buying this one for a long time because I thought that I'd mainly play it with two and the dummy third player concept bothered me.  I wish I'd picked it up sooner, as I was missing out on a game that plays great for two and would be fun for more.  The dummy third player is not an issue at all, the mechanics of it are simple and it is not cumbersome.  I'm looking forward to playing this one quite a bit.

Need a few more plays to figure out a strategy.  In two games played, I've finished first and last.  Seems to be a good deal of luck but there are a few obvious strategic moves to help your chances.  Building up a large hand of money cards early seems like a reasonable strategy.

I waver back and forth with my thoughts on Alhambra, but if I'm being honest, I feel like it's a truly great family style strategy game, perhaps bogged down by too many expansions.

Alhambra ist eines dieser Spiele, die bei uns immer mal wieder auf den Tisch kommen. Die Regeln sind einfach erklärt und das Spielprinzip zeitlos. Es gibt 4 unterschiedliche, antike Währungen im Spiel. Davon versuchen die Spieler so passend wie möglich Teile für ihren Palast zu kaufen. Warum passend? Nun, dafür gibt es zwei Gründe: Erstens gibt es kein Wechselgeld und zweitens erhält man eine zusätzliche Aktion, wenn man passend bezahlt. Die unterschiedlichen Räume, die ein Palast so braucht, sind auf Plättchen dargestellt, die man dann in bester Carcasonne-Tradition an seinen Palast anbauen muss. Dabei gibt es einige Dinge zu beachten, z.B. muss jeder Teil des Palastes vom Startplättchen aus erreichbar sein. Während der drei Wertungen, bekommen die Spieler mit den meistens Gebäuden einer Art Siegpunkte. Alhambra ist eben ein zeitloser Klassiker und gehört in jede Sammlung!

Alhambra is a bit too balanced. There is not enough differentiation among the upper tier majorities that what inevitably happens, it seems, is that someone gets first in one and the player who was in second place gets first in another where the first first player then has second, and so on. [Does that make any sense? No. Ok. Read it again?]

4 is probably the sweet spot for the game, to make enough competition for the second and third places in majority scoring, and to make it harder to hold on to a first place at that. But, with 4 [or more... *shudder*] the game is quite tactical and chaotic, falling prey to Through The Ages' "You can't know what will be available next turn" syndrome.

Actually managing the money and bonus actions is an interesting enough system [and reminds me a bit of Schacht's lovely mechanism in California], but ultimately the rest of the game just doesn't have enough ways for players to shake things up and the palace-building spatial puzzle is too limiting [with the wall] to your tile selection choices.

Nice looking game, and while pretty solid, it's rather repetitive and unfortunately there's not a lot of interaction in it, apart from buying a tile or grabbing the money your opponents might have wanted.  There is a lot of randomness in everything, which puts quite a bit of luck in this game.      I think my expectations were just too high.  Could've been better if there was an auction element in it...  I do like it slightly better with more players, than just with 2.  A comparable game that IMO is better is "Carcassonne: Hunters & Gatherers".

RATING: 7
2 to 4 players Alhambra really shines. It's a game that has a lot of little thinking that keeps you always occupied, without being too hard on your brains. Like Ticket to Ride it is a game you gladly play, even if it nevers reach the peaks of fun or hilariousness of other games, but I like this more. Another game I'd like to play more often...

RATING: 5
A decent, family-level Euro. Feels like Ticket to Ride mixed with Carcassonne, but somehow isn't nearly as good as either game. Fun once in awhile, but it's become pretty mediocre to me. It doesn't scale very well, and it's also very frustrating when someone takes the one tile in the game you were waiting for.

I really enjoy the puzzle building aspect of this game.

Although this game is executed very well, the graphic design does let it down a few notches.  Sadly, having a few of the colours duplicated within the different building types and denominations of money can needlessly make this game more difficult for newer players to fully grasp.

Overall, easily a recommendable game.

This summers hot game for the kids and I.  My oldest daughter Sam has yet to loose playing.  Easy to explain, easy to learn and fun for the kids.  Great gateway game.  Now I just gotta keep the impulses down and try not to buy all the expansions.  I'm kinna crazy like that.

RATING: 9
I've played this a few times now and I really like it. It has a great simplicity to strategy ratio. The game is extremely easy to learn and teach yet there are enough interesting decisions to make every time your turn comes around that the game remains interesting throughout the game and on further replays as well. I like the simplicity of either buying tiles, rearranging your Alhambra/reserve board or simply taking money. 

Those 3 simple actions combined with the bonus turns you get when buying tiles for exact amounts causes the game to have a minimum of AP yet still has interesting decision making for a game in this light/midweight class. Definitely a 9 for me at the moment as we can play this with our 12 year old with no difficulty and the 2 player game works well enough that we can play that when it's just the two of us as well. I can see this game becoming a good "go-to" game to default to when we can't decide what else we want to play but have about an hour to fill in for boardgaming.

Still a solid 9 rating and one of my preferred light games currently.

Alhambra is a simple game with some interesting decisions. Do you buy a tile before someone else does or do you take money to be able to buy it with an exact amount (and get an extra action)? Which colors do you buy to get or maintain a majority? How do you arrange them to keep your building options open? However, while skills are important, luck with the cards still seems to be the most decisive in the game.

[u][BGCOLOR=#FFCC00]Review[/u][/bgcolor]: [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/281531/alhambra-detailed-review]A detailed review (+ expansions)[/url]

2015-05-31: Note de 7.8 (de mai 2013) revue à la baisse - une seule partie (incomplète) jouée depuis ce temps. Aucune envie d'y jouer malgré l'acquisition de deux extansions. Trop de hasard et trop grand manque de contrôle peut-être?... La petite monnaie avantage les joueurs pouvant l'acquérir, afin d'ultérieurement pouvoir payer le prix exact et ainsi bénéficier d'actions supplémentaires.

Je suis tenté de donner une note inférieure à 6.75 mais l'existence de nombreuses extansions (non essayées) pallient possiblement aux faiblesses du jeu de base.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Tile placement meets set collection, it's a game about efficiency. There's a small amount of interaction as you have to constantly look at your opponent's tableau to determine what colored tile to take. There's a lot of luck though, particularly when new tiles are turned up.  

The four-color currency and getting extra turn when you purchase a building in exact are what annoys me most as these rules feel very gamey without making it more strategic (in fact probably more random). The only good thing about it is it's easy, but even then it actually takes quite a bit of time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Alhambra looks appealing, and touts much acclaim, but suffers from horrendous design flaws. Alhambra is the type of game you have to learn through experience and punishment; Alhambra doesn't know how to protect players from themselves, and entire game sessions become lop-sided lost causes if any player realizes too late that a rule was forgotten or misunderstood. Games should not require luck just to have a level playing field, and Alhambra's exclusive use of random drawing is an extreme detriment. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My love for this game has cooled a bit but it is still a good game. There is a lot of luck in the tile and money draws which can be both fun and frustrating at times. I do love seeing the completed Alhambras at the end. A good game for newcomers to the hobby and lighter family play.

I don't have much to say about this one - to me it's a thoroughly average game. Not bad, but not great either. Maybe it needs the expansions to shine, I'll have to try them out. The mechanic of being rewarded for paying with exact change kind of frustrates me, as that was entirely luck, and so of course rarely happens to me, while I watch my opponents have all of these extra turns.

Got a recommendation for this so I want to try.

UPDATE:

I tried this game and I didn't dislike it and there's a lot of things about it I liked including the nice components and cool city building. I can honestly say that the game did not blow me away as much as it has many other people. Perhaps it needs more playthroughs as I'm to understand that each playthrough is quite different. When you add in the expansions, this is apparently that much greater of a difference. The experience I had with this game was pretty good but it still seemed like another hour long Euro game. Not in a bad way, but it just didn't really pull me in. I might just not be as good with future planning and spacial logic and the layers of strategy invovled in those things with this game, but as of right now, this is only a middle of the road game for me but that could change.

This SdJ winner is somewhat disappointing. I like Stimmt So except the horrible graphics on the cards. Alhambra add the elements of wall building but that is actually not that interesting. Also, unlike Stimmt So, Alhambra doesn't come with the price distribution chart (I think it is absolutely necessary to have it so that players can be ready to pay exact when certain cards/tiles show up).

Tried with 6-player is a terrible idea. I tried with 3 -player or 4 about 5 times and my opinion doesn't change. Stimmt So is better as a game. It seems more focused.

I enjoyed this game very much, the auction mechanic is unique and I can see a number of strategies you would want to develop to play this well and the tile laying is always fun and with this game is also unique and interesting in how to optimize points while competing with the other players strengths and weaknesses.

RATING: 7
Played once.  On balance, this game is about as good as its predecessor, "Stimmt So!".  On the one hand, the game is better produced, and the added tile-laying rules create a few interesting decisions during play.  On the other hand, the game lacks the humourous theme of the previous game, and the added rules complicate a game that was elegantly simple, without making it significantly better.  If I didn't already own Stimmt So!, I'd probably buy a copy; it's a good game.

A game I truly enjoy playing at the end of the week with my wife, just enough challenge and sufficient amount of luck involved for a lazy day. It has a good life-span as well. Saying this, I do not like the 4 player games at all, the complete non-interaction becomes more apparent with more players, and you can plan less when there's more players involved, so it loses a strategic element. Randomness of draws is an issue with all numbers of players: 7 (2-players), 6 (3-players) 5.5 (4-players)
------------
2P: Works very well with 2 players, I would even say shines. Good game for non-gamers. 

My wife's rating: 8 "Very good but the complete lack of interaction is an issue."

[--- What I like about it ---]
The game mechanics are extremely simple.  The number of things to learn are few but the choices to be made have an impact on the game.  A blend of luck and skill.  And there is a subtle hint of ruthlessness towards beating out your opponents.

[--- What I don't like about it ---]
This game can be frustrating with more than four players.  Beyond that, if a card comes up that you want, it's almost guaranteed to be gone by your turn, making this feel like more luck than choices.

Straightforward game in which players are simultaneously trying to draft both money to buy tiles and the tiles that they will use to score points. The exact change mechanism, which gives players an extra action each time they pay exactly in the required currency, is a great rule and often the differentiator between winning and losing. There's something self-balancing here between grabbing too much money and overpaying for too many tiles that I find satisfying. The spatial puzzle of designing your palace puts this one above its card game predecessor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Like Stimmt So!, this game has a sweet spot of 3-4 for number of players. Two player games are interesting, but 5 and 6 players turn it into a slow-moving, luck-filled bore. I really like the building mechanics - this adds a welcome new dimension to the game. My rating reflects the disparity when played by differing numbers of players: 2 Players - 6.5, 3-4 Players - 8, 5 players - 5, 6 Players - 4. Overall a 7. ***UPDATE*** In a recent 6-player game, we used the add-on rule of being able to buy a tile out of turn for exact money. It helped a bit, but I still dislike this game with any more than 4 players.

On initial play I gave this game a 7. I thought it was interesting and even tho I got hammered, I figured it was just because I missed something in the strategy. On my second play I still felt the same way. However, after about half the game I realized what I was missing wasn't a strategy, but I was missing opportunity. Time after time I watched as the pieces I wanted to buy were snatched up just before I was able to. Not only that, but the opportunists before me seemed to have all the luck in being able to either take 2 cards under 5, or play multiple times because they were able to pay the exact amount 1, 2 or even 3 times! I felt like I had no control and the outcome for me was based on the luck of the cards and tiles drawn...

Only three simple choices to make per turn (usually) but so hard to expand the Alhambra after mid-game, sometimes blocking yourself, allowing only one tile to expand from.  Pretty entertaining game with an interesting and somewhat cumbersome scoring system per building color and wall length, plus increasing score values for the buildings as the game progresses.

What made me trade it was that in one game, the person that understood the game the least of all players was actually the winner at the end.  This made me suspect there was a whole more luck to Alhambra than I originally thought.  After that play, I did not feel like bringing it out.

I really like the puzzle aspect of this game, with the often agonising choice between getting money, buying tiles or re-arranging your Alhambra to try and score more points.

The market place is a really nice touch allowing you to gamble on the tile you need still being there by the time you can afford it.

Scoring really ramps up at the end of the game, so even those that don't seem to be doing well can suddenly power ahead to win.

Very light game that seems random with four or five players.  With fewer players, the game might become more tactical/opportunistic?

I think for the light genre, this is a good choice.  It's colorful, there are lots of titles to mess with, and there's enough interest in what others are buying and placing that players aren't simply just sitting there between turns.

Wow, is this game ever random!  Do you have players who's minds wander during a game, or who tend to chat and pay no attention whatsoever to what's going on until it's their turn?  Well that might be a negative in most games, but that's status quo in this one!

There is nothing you can do to affect this game until it rolls around to your turn, so you might as well have a side game going on to occupy your time while the other players are engaging themselves with the business of stealing your opportunities.  And the card drafting just makes matters worse, allowing those who can pay exact amounts (even if they have less cash than you) to get extra plays, thereby gaining extra cards.  This often has the net effect of them MAKING A PROFIT on their purchase while you are forced to overpay.  Yeah, that's fair.  What a random piece of crap.  My rating is plummeting even as I type this.

No wonder non-gamers seem to take to this one so well.  It's a game that they have as much of a chance of winning as veteran gamers.  Heck, a stinkin' trained monkey with a lobotomy could play this as well as anyone else!

RATING: 6.5
I was disappointed at how boring this game was. It has the set matching characteristics of 'Shadows Over Camelot" as well as the tile arrangement and pattern matching of "Carcassone", but the formula is always the same: get card sets to buy building combinations. The base game just does not have enough variables to make the game much of a strategic affair (drastically increasing player interaction might have augmented this).

Although advertised as a 2-6 player game, the 2-player version is a variant that requires a Dummy 3rd player which isn't ever a good implementation.

2 or 3 players is best. More players make the game chaotic. Has some significant luck elements -> sometimes I hate this game sometimes I love it ;)

RATING: 7
This is a pretty quick-to-play game with rules that are not very tough to learn.  You have different monetary values that allow you to buy different buildings at different times for your city.  The two ways to score are by counting the biggest continuous wall surrounding your city and the amount of buildings you own in each color compared to your opponents.  You score 4 times per game.

The fact that this is such an easy/quick game to learn/play, and gives players enough choices to feel like they are the ones winning, not just by luck, is what will keep this game in my collection for a long time coming.

One of the first "better" games I played. The sweet spot is definitely at three players, in fact it's the only player count that works. With two it's too fiddly and with more than three too chaotic.

Best with 2 players, just about playable with 3, but becomes far too random with any more. I've played it quite a lot - nearly 20 times -  and mostly with the same opponent and I don't feel like there has been any evolution to our play. I quite like the tile laying aspect, but I come away from a game of Alhambra with a rather flat feeling. (6.5)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Alhambra is one of those games that I feel is a 7, a strong 7, but my friends wonder why I never offer to play it.

Well the reason for that is simply because I like playing other themed games.  Does this game have 'theme'?  Eh.  It feels like you're building an alhambra, yes!  But do I want to build an alhambra?  Not often, I usually rather build an army, a galactic empire, fly through space, trade resources, and whatever else.

Want to play a really fun euro?  Get this game!  It's a very strong euro game that has tons of simple mechanics to make you coming back for more.  The way to get money, expand your profits, and develop a building offers different ways to generate the most points to win.

The game offers a 2 player variant that actually doesn't just make me feel like I'm just removing resources.  Dirk actually feels like he's playing the game and blocking some plays.

It plays relatively fast and is extremely easy to learn.

One thing I did notice however is that often the leader will blow everyone one out of the water as far as taking a lead at the end.  It's not necessarily bad since that huge point lead doesn't happen till final scoring, but still, people always feel like they messed up some where.

I stand by this game as a great family game and a phenomenal euro.  I just am not into the theme usually, but I always enjoy playing it.

[so why are other games lower score than this one?  Because this game is high value outside 'theme' games.  I hold theme based games on much higher pedastool than family games that don't push theme].
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I enjoy this game -- a good balance of luck and efficient decision-making, it's easy to teach new gamers, and experienced players can play rather quickly.  Luck is a factor in this game, so it is understandable that not every player will enjoy it.  A player with a "lucky streak" can pull into the lead, but this is also true of games like Settlers and Carcassone.  

Alhambra does have player interaction, but it's very indirect.  This is not a solitaire game of "build a nice palace," after all; your goal is to score more points than the other players by edging out leads in the various types of buildings and building chains of walls.  Anyone who ignores the other players is unlikely to do well.  Fun if you're willing to accept a bit of randomness.  The expansions, especially the Worker Huts in the first expansion, add a lot more options (and more strategic choices) if you want a slightly heavier game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Alhambra isn't a particularly innovative game - players bid for tiles so that they can build a complex of buildings that holds the biggest amount of each type of bluidings and as many walls as possible. There are five money cards and four building tiles on display, each building being sold by its amount of points in a different currency); a player can in their turn take a money card into their hand, buy a tile with money from their hand to place it on Alhambra or reserve, or alter the layout of the Alambra. All in the best German style.

What is memorable about Alhambra, though, is its huge variety: the different combinations of buildings and currencies bring a different challenge each game, and even though players can still benefit from a good draw good timing is required to carry out the right actions at the right time. The level of interaction is reduced to the classical "snatch them before the others do" but the play still feels fresh and dynamic.

Delusione per un vincitore dello Spiel des Jahres tra l'altro apprezzato da molti miei amici. In sintesi ho trovato il gioco noioso, astratto, ripetitivo e completamente governato dalla fortuna. Cercando di essere meno cattivo posso definirlo un party game che arriva fino a sei giocatori (ma giocato in sei rende vano ogni tentativo di strategia), semplice da spiegare e abbastanza corto, nulla di più.

RATING: 6
A set of interesting elements which don't quite tie together well enough. There needs to be more building restriction and better money distribution for this to really work. But, on the plus side, there are some good quality pieces and art, and a game pitched perfectly to appeal to an array of players. The base game's one-dimensionality is improved by a plethora of add-as-you-like expansions, often (but not always) resulting in something a little more strategic. 

Two-player variants often feel a bit bolted-on, but this one works just fine and best of all is the entirely natural interplay between having a long-term strategy and tactical backstabbing when playing with two.

It took a few games for Alhambra to grow on me, and it is usually an enjoyable experience.  Easy enough to teach to less experienced gamers, but still offers some interesting decisions and strategy.  I've played with 2-4 players and all play well, but I prefer 2-3 as planning becomes more difficult with more players.  My wife loves this game, too.

Este juego estuvo en mis Top 3 durante los primeros meses que lo tuvimos. Después de haberlo jugado unas 10-15 veces comienzo a volverse monótono y un tanto tedioso.

[b]Alhambra[/b] was traded away with Thebes for El Grande Decennial Edition 10/28/14.
Received in a trade (3/11/14).

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]This was a game my wife and I enjoyed, but our kids never got into it. The much prefer the tile laying found in Carcassonne or the route building in Ticket to Ride (both are different games, but fill a similar niche in our collection). I ended up trading this away because my wife and I did not enjoy the 2 player variant. In the end I am sad to see this go, but I know it would just sit on our shelves.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]- Tile laying/ building your city, which is always a hit in my house.
- Having to figure out the layout of your alhambra in order to extend the outer walls.
- Simplicity of choices: buy tiles, take money and add/place tiles from your reserve.
- $ management: you need to buy tiles with specific colored money and if you pay exact change you get another turn.
- Uncertain scoring rounds which adds some tension to when you want to lay tiles versus stockpile cash.
- The anniversary edition has beautiful components with a really nice board. It is too bad this is not the standard edition that Queen puts out.[/i]

A nice medium weight, weeknight game. This is a simple game with a great money collecting mechanic and fun puzzle mechanic for tile laying. The game is excellent for 2-players and probably a lot more competitive with more. 

You start the game with cards totaling 20pts or more (which is great, because players starts with a different number of cards due to the coin totals on their cards). You may draw more money cards or buy Alhambra tiles. If you can exactly match (in money) the cost of the tile, you may buy something else or take money cards. Once you get your tile(s) place them on your Alhambra (your own personal city that you are making) or on your board. Be careful to make a nice long wall around your city for extra points.

RATING: 6
An interesting game, but too much of a luck factor for my liking. The game gets very chaotic with 4 or more players making it very difficult to plan ahead or even plan for your next move. In fact, you may as well leave  the table and wait until it's your turn and then make the best action(s) available. I am rating this as a 6 only because I like the game mechanism with only 3 players. The element of luck takes on a less significiant factor with only 2 players altering the "board" before you get to make your next move allowing you to formulate and execute some sort of strategy. Otherwise, I would give this one a 4 or a 5.

越玩越覺得是挺吃運氣的遊戲
雖然判斷還是挺重要的
規則:
*將一個玩家標記放在自己的獅子泉起始板塊，另一個放在分數0。
*將貨幣卡洗勻後，每位玩家翻卡直到數字總合>=20為止，並成為該玩家手牌。
*翻開4張貨幣於遊戲版圖旁，將剩餘的貨幣分為5堆，將第一張計分卡塞入第二堆後洗勻，第二張則塞入第四堆後洗勻，依照順序將貨幣卡由上往下堆成一疊， 遊戲由手牌張數最少的玩家成為起始玩家。
行動三選一
1.拿取貨幣
玩家從場上攤開的挑選1張，或是拿取任意張數但總和最高為5的貨幣卡。
2.購買建築
玩家付出該建築上標示數字的貨幣卡，且貨幣要對應該格，如果金額剛好，可或得一次額外行動，購買到的建築物待回合結束一起進行建設，不建設的板塊可放至自己的玩家板塊上。
阿爾罕布拉宮建設規則
*所有建築物的方向都必須和獅子泉起始板塊同一方向
*每個連接的建築，其邊線都必須互相符合，即城牆連接城牆，或空曠接空曠。
*至少有一邊與目前已蓋好的板塊相連，不得角對角相連。
*每個建築物都必須遵守從起始板塊「步行可達」的規則，須穿過圍牆或是根本無法到達則不行。
*不得在建設後產生封閉的空洞。
3.改變建設
當要改變阿爾罕布拉宮的建設時，由以下三個方式挑選一項進行。
a.從玩家板塊上的建築挑選一個建設放入阿爾罕布拉宮內。
b.從玩家的阿爾罕布拉宮內挑選一個建築放至玩家板塊上。
c.將玩家板塊上的一個建築與阿爾罕布拉宮內的一個建築交換。
*翻開計分卡，則將計分牌放到一旁；補回4張翻開的貨幣卡後，隨即計算分數，最長圍牆一個一分，顏色建築平手，分數平分，如計算到第二名則把一二分數加總除二，無條件捨去
*當某位玩家的回合結束時，無法將場上的建築板塊補至4張時，遊戲結束，根據現金發剩下版塊(平手都沒有)，並最後記分

Nice hand management stroke how-can-I-best-fit-this-tile in my collection game. It's nothing like Carcassonne whatsoever. The game plays best with 3-4 players. If you have 5 or 6 it is better to play something else. Adding extra players only adds down-time and chaos since it removes your ability to plan ahead - by the time your turn come round again the cards and tiles on offer have all changed.

I could see how my enjoyment might lessen with more than 3 players (more downtime between turns, more players to have to tally their building counts for). Personally I think it's an improvement over Stimmt So - the differing tile characteristics provide a bit more to think about in the tile selection, and the artwork & ambience is classier. But on your turn you're either going to be presented with good money/tiles, or you're not, and your game can turn accordingly. Pretty good though in a light niche.

Great game for all kinds of players, newcomers or advanced players alike. Has some original mechanics and is fun to play, not difficult to master and easy to learn. Doesn't take too long to play, so that makes for a great game if you prefer something lighter, but you can also make it more challenging if combined with one or several modules from the several expansions.

- Rules are well organised, it's easy to teach and the game is easy to grasp, will appeal to all kinds of players: newcomers, occasional players, seasoned players and advanced players.

'Late' coming to this one but I'm really enjoying it. Lots of options of victories and one of those games where an opponent always seems to take your tile or card just before you were going to. Think 3 or 4 players might be the sweet spot but also enjoyable with 2. It's a relatively quick game also

RATING: 8
I like this game for much the same reason I like Carcassonne so much - there's always so many things you want to be doing with your turn, and you can only do some.

As an added bonus, this nice level of tension comes from a quite simple system. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A decent family game. The two player game is lacking (we don't enjoy the bot player) but the multi-player game is good. Building the Alhambra is enjoyable and getting the extra actions from spending the exact amount of money always sparks that feeling of accomplishment.

RATING: 7.7
Nice fast paced game. Easy to learn. Good filler, good game for six players. 

Tried a six player game with five exapansions and the promo = 21 modules. Only the setup took 90 mins. Since all the expansions was new for all of us it took quite some time to play. We also realized with that many modules, you had to concentrate on a few of them, both of strategic reasons and because you couldn't keep track of everything. It was still fun though. 

Since then I have played a four player base game only game, and it was as fun. The most important thing in the beginning is to get a lot of cards so you can do at least two buys when you but, preferably two even money buys so you also get to pick money. Never buy only one tile unless it's very important for your majority and/or close to scoring. Don't underestimate blue and red tiles, since they are fewer you can easily get a secure majority and score them all three times.

RATING: 8.5
Very good game with interesting mechanics.  I'd rate it higher, but the game changes so dramatically as you add players that it really turns into a different game.  Player interaction is very limited, but the decisions you make are strong enough that with 3-5 it's a fantastic play.  I'd rate it higher if it scaled better with more players.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I used to love this game, but it's sort of faded with time.  To excel, you really have to pay attention to what everyone else is acquiring, an aspect overlooked by many.  Additionally, having a good feel for when the scoring will happen helps, as you'll know when to overpay for tiles.  I've found building a long wall to be very advantageous, but you have to make sure you don't wall yourself in.  Having weirdly-shaped cities with tails and chimneys and whatnot may not look pretty, but I think it's better for walls.

(5+ plays)

RATING: 9
My first euro game. I love it still, but the luck factor can grate a bit when the tiles kick you in the teeth (which is admittedly rare enough).  Lots of "groans" from the multi-player interaction.  Good gateway game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One play with 5, I came in second, lost by one point at 75. Light-weight, there is some minor decision-making, the game is mostly notable for nice looking pieces, good combination of card, board, and some Carc-style city building. Ladies enjoyed it. 3/06: Enjoyed played a couple of games 2p, which I definately enjoyed more than with 5. Rating stays based on this. 6/27 Have played several more times with 2p and 4p, and have enjoyed sessions. Not a particularly difficult game, nonetheless the mechanisms are simple and pleasing. 8/07 - we've been playing this a bit more lately, and I'm upgrading to a 7. Fun as a 2p game.

Oct 2014: I've played Alhambra quite a bit. Even picked up the (horrible) iOS app and tried that. I am kind of burned out on it. I did try a 6p game with my brother using a bunch of expansions from his Big Box edition, which was fine... they were all hard-core Alhambra players, and it went pretty fast, and I even came in second I think.

I'm just done I think - I think I explored what was there pretty well, and it's time to move on. I would definitely play it if that is what's on the table, but I am probably not going to try to encourage it.

Traded away. Good riddance, I will never look back! The only thing I will miss in this game are the superfluous markers that is supposed to mark the fountains - I used to use them in AOEIII. Now I have to find something else.

***

I like the artwork, the box and the pieces, I give it half a notch just for that. I also think it's mildly entertaining building Alhambra. But still Alhambra just misses the mark of being an "ok" waste of time. All in all a rather pointless and soulless exercise. Extremly overrated on the geek IMHO. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Beautiful city building game with set collection mechanics. Good as a gateway game, but does not have that strong staying power. Player interaction is low and luck factor a bit too high.  Plays best with three or four players in my opinion (I wouldn´t recommend it with 5 or 6). The funny thing while playing with two players is that you might end up getting the third place.

Excellent game, though it does get frustating to have to overspend to get a tile to fit in your Alhambra because your money cards do not give an exact fit, and you know that if you don't take the tile it won't be there next turn. Possibly the group I play with but no one seems to make much use of the reserve board, and re-arranging tiles.

My SO's favorite game, she usually wins. It is a fun game that has some depth. I'd say a step further than TTR.

(01/18) Plays recorded here don't cover all of the times I've played it, it was one of the first games I got, so it got played a lot, at least 8 times more than what it says here.

When picking up a game, I feel ticket to ride is easier to explain, so with people not familiar with boargames maybe I'd go with it, as I said before, Alhambra feels like TTR with a bit more to it, the satisfaction of the tile laying makes it a favorite with people who have already played some boardgames and are looking to pump up. Really fun to get played with friends who already know it. There's a lot of luck on the tiles that get on the market and the money you get from the deck, but that adds up to the notion of advancing and taking chances with the things that are available.

I think I'd never get rid of it. Plus my girlfriend would kill me. I wish there was a way to play 2p without having to have that dummy player.

This game is totally good for playing with my parents. It's very simple and not too much of a brain burn for them. This game has a nice amount of luck but doesn't affect the game too much to nullify the strategic part of the game. I can't win all the time against my family and I like this game as much as Carcassonne. 

---- Update ----
Played 2-player game with fiancee today. This game is fun even with a bot because the game requires minimalist control over Dirk the bot. He just makes scoring interesting.

Very solid game.  "Good" and "Bad" turns tend to come in waves, and it's rare when you can do exactly what you want each turn.  I've played this several times and have finished in the top two every time.  I therefore think all arguments that this game is "luck" are just bunk idgits that don't know how to play.  I admit there can be some luck, especially in games of 5+, but the people who tend not to do well in our games are the ones who continually overpay for things or buy indiscriminately.  With 5 or 6, it can take a bit too long, especially if someone has an AP problem.

RATING: 6
I don't really get what all the hype is about this game. Thematically very weak. Not much player interaction. The most fun part is arranging the tiles to make your alhambra, but that's about the extent of it. I just bought Castles of Mad King Ludwig and that is an AMAZING tile placing game that actually makes you feel like you're laying out a castle floor plan and is a lot more strategic. Not much strategy in this game. It's easy to learn though and probably a better game for kids than adults.

Excellent game with interesting mechanics and many paths to victory. My only knock against it is that it often feels that you are at the mercy of the draw;  unlucky money and building draws for you or lucky ones for your opponents can really swing things. Explaining the rules for re-design is also a little bit of a headache. Very good overall though. Also, I think the box and insert for this game is one fo the best I've ever seen. Everything fits in there perfectly.

Elegant mechanics flow together very smoothly but....I've seen these mechanics many times before - nothing really new about this game.  Played one 6-player game, I'm sure this would be much better with 3-4 players.  Rating will surely go up with more plays.  Game plays relatively quick, very little downtime.  Little play interaction however, a bit like solitaire.  Game very similar to Dirk Henn's "Atlantic Star." Great game for families, I can definitely see how this was SdJ in 2003.

Profound disappointment.  Terrible game for 5 players; no decisions to be made at all, just guess what you'll need by the time its your turn again.  I only played once, and could be talked into giving it a second chance, but only with 3 players.

Update:  Alhambra is good, but not good enough compared to other games out there.  Don't get me wrong, if all you had was Alhambra, you'd have a great time turning to it again and again...  however, the game is very random and is best played with 3 or 4, or else you lose any sense of control.  It's a good game for people who have played a few rounds of Carcassonne and Settlers of Catan, and would like to see how they may work  if they were combined together.  Sorta.  Good game, but not as good as some of the others I own. :D

When do I play this?:
I play Alhambra with my friends who are new to eurogames but yearn for something deeper.  This is usually after they've played Carcassonne and find it too basic.

Solid city building game.  The four colors of money interact with the building varieties to create a unique game each time.  More plays will help determine which type of building colors are best, but the wall element is a great risk/reward item.  Unique each time played, there is a lot of balancing done between what could be and what currently is.

RATING: 6.5
Feels like a combination of the tile laying of Carcassonne (minus the meeple placement & scoring) and the card collecting & spending of Ticket to Ride. Perhaps has a little more depth than first appears, with quite a few ways to out-play others, and playing well can take a little more thought than you might expect.

NOTE: 2 player games rely on having a dummy 3rd player (to maintain competition for tiles where one player already has 1st place majority), although this doesn't work too badly.

I like to work on my own Alhambra without interference from the other players; thus, this is the type of "no conflict" game that I enjoy. Still, you need to be aware of the tile distribution and the length of your opponents' wall; otherwise, you end the game with a great-looking Alhambra that's not worth the winning total. And don't be afraid to spend more on tiles than they're worth. I've lost a game or two because I was trying to obtain exact change for available tiles instead of buying critical tiles for more coins than they were worth. I'm talking about tiles that make you the majority holder or tiles that join two long walls together.

One of the first games I bought and I thought it was FANTASTIC. It can be played without any small parts so it's good for people with babies. You need a dummy player with two and it's a little bit the luck of the draw, and then with three it's ok but with four it is slow with lots of downtime. Maybe you want to chat and relax but I saw a game with more than 4 people and those people looked really bored. 

I bought all the expansions, and some of them helped but not enough.

A light-medium strategy game that seems a hit with gamers and non-gamers alike. Lots of variety in the expansions to mix it up. Plays great for 2-4. With some of the expansions that give players something to do off-turn ("Vizier's Favor", particularly), works great with 5-6. Always a game night hit.

The game suggest that there is a lot you will want to keep in mind: what buildings to get a majority, planning the palace and getting a long outer wall. However, what tiles are available to you is so much based on luck, that there is very little room for any planning or strategy.

RATING: 6
After a revisit to Alhambra I can still see the appeal of the gameplay: there is almost constant tension as there is often a race to amass money for the desired tile, which is also fuelled by the desire to hold off overpaying for it to instead draw currencies to pay exact for the powerful and gratifying extra turn(s).

But the adrenalin doesn't stop there with the push your luck element as there is the exciting scoring cards somewhere in the drawpile. One feature here at Alhambra from its predecessor Stimmt So is that a player can take as many currency cards upto the value of 5 or less so can speed up the appearance of the scoring card if it is to their advantage.

Then there is the climax at game end when only 1-3 tiles are left to draft and these are purchased in a reveal (my favourite game feature) by the player holding the most in that currency. Like Ticket to Ride, Alhambra is very good gateway game, filled with anxiety and table-thumping frustration as someone else does what you wanted to do.

So thankfully there are moments of relief when the scoring takes place, and this is the first of some niggles I have with the design. My pet peeve of majority scoring is here and whereas in Stimmt So the 'shares' were clumped together to make comparisons easier on the eye, in Alhambra's change to a tile laying subgame (possibly due to the success of Carcassonne), the colours of the player's share holdings are scattered.So really not an improvement over Stimmt So as time spent scoring has partially increased as well as thinking where to best put the tile.

And tiles are probably the biggest complaint for me: to make any skilful decision really requires knowledge of the tile manifest, and here it is too detailed for my taste. I don't think the colour quantity on the player boards are enough, I like to know have I wasted my time putting a wall here, will there be another one to put next to it, and more importantly what will be the colour and price of the tile? I like that the wall(s) can make it easier to determine if it is desirable or not for an opponent to fit into his grounds, and they are another source of vps, but my threshold for tile-drawing assesments is probably at the Zooloretto level.

I've also noticed that the game runs on two chaotic features, the tile draw and the currency deck, but as these are both drafted and so long as the game is kept at 3 players I don't mind it so much (though I've noticed that the expansions seem to address this level of chaos; if it starts to bother me too much, there is always Palazzo to fall back on). So after the revisit, I'm happy to play occasionally but I much prefer O Zoo le Mio's swift majority scoring and gameplay (though I may be tempted with the new version which joins the fragemented boards into a colourful overhead shot of Alhambra with everything centralised and more importantly the scoring track on the outside, rather than off to one side).

This is an enjoyable game with a high replayability factor. The theme is building the city of Alhambra (Spain) by buying/building tiles that represent different types of buildings and paying for them by cards that represent four different types of currencies. It is on the light/medium strategy side and is very accessible to non-gamers as well.

The rule about taking another turn when you buy a tile by paying for it with the exact amount of money, which is a fundamental component of the game, gives the game an inherent element of luck. Virtually all winning strategies revolve around and rely on utilizing this rule, so the game can not rid itself of a prominent luck factor.
Despite this, I think it is a great game and fun and entertaining and the luck factor is not overwhelming and good play will pay off. I enjoy this game every time I play it.

A worthy game for anyone's collection. If you're a newer gamer looking to get into something more than a simple mechanics game like qwirkle/52deck playing card games kind of stuff this is a good place to start. If you're already a more vet gamer expanding your options I'd go straight for the BigBox version of this with all the expansions included. The base game has tons of replay but if you're likely to put real mileage on it the BigBox has great production value to it. Tile laying/city building, market purchasing, and direct competition over limited resources would be the distilled description I'd give for this.

[floatleft][ImageID=389723][/floatleft]Alhambra borders on filler status but in spite of being so light weight it is still an excellent game.

More than three players would make it impossible to plan ahead and the two player variant does not entice me.

I did not like this game in 2004, but was happy to give it another go 12 years later: still don’t like it. The randomness of the cards had too much effect on play: the way the cards fell I picked up one 6 and one 7 in the first 90% of the game and consequently could not buy anything that would put me in contention. The winner had almost as poor cards, but was able to buy a couple of high number buildings early and rode those points the whole game, something she felt was ridiculous. The scoring rules were not known well enough by the person running the game and it was all a bit of a mess, much like the rule book. Ask me again in 2028.

I happen to like the tension of the building market as well as the set making idea.  I know that some are not fans of the wall issue, but I think that really adds to the game.  It makes it less a game of "gobble up all the towers you can."  I realize that it is a bit of a "light" game, but I find it a lot of fun.

The components are also very nice.  The building tiles are nice weight and the cards are good.

A good but somewhat unremarkable lightish game. There are some interesting decisions around which tiles to go for and how to fit them in your tableau, and when to go for money or try to wait for exact change. I like the interaction of trying to get majorities in different colors, which makes you pay attention to what everyone else is doing without the player needing to do a lot of mental calculations each round to figure out the optimal move. There's not anything about it that I really dislike, but no part of it is truly compelling either. It's a good game, certainly more interesting than simpler tile-laying games like Carcassonne, but not one I would seek out.

The addition of the tile laying (with color distinctions) to Stimmt So! is good. I think 3 or 4 players is best since with more there is so little control over tile planning and selection although it works well as even a 2-player. The multiple small denomination money rule would well serve Stimmt So! Most recent play with several of the expansions changed the game in small ways but didn't really make it any better. Focus needs to be on a few colors, aquiring many target-of-opportunity tiles might make a nice display but will not garner many points.

Another predictable to play Euro. The player interaction you have doesn't really affect you that much. Just build the best whatever an alhambra is, and win by a mile.

Enjoyed the game. Liked its mechanics - swapping between collecting sets of cash for purchases. If you can purchase at exact change get an extra turn. 
Good mix of strategic where do I get my majorities versus what can I pick up now. Do I go for majorities or try to push out long walls and restrict future placements

It happens to be the game we play more often lately.
Visually outstanding. Rewarding as at the end of the game you don't have only VPs but also a palace you've just designed.
The only two little aspects I dislike:
* the 120 points counting pad [tip: we make it easier just using the first 100 spots and then going back to 1, 2... for 101, 102...]
* and the coincidence of building colors and currency colors (some people would slip up).
Anyway, all the people I played it with did enjoy it, gamers or not, with no exception.
It is pretty simple but different strategies can lead to victory. I like the 3 times scoring system.
Plus, our 8yo girl digs Alhambra and does pretty good at it.

A very 'simple' but not uninteresting game tile / card collection. There is not as much interaction as I would prefer and it is pretty much up to each individual player to make his fortune in this game with the actions of the other players' only indirectly influence your own. It is still nice to see when your opponents gnarl their teeth when you snatch away the card or tile away from them but I would not say that this game is very interactive or competitive in the sense of being confrontational. But it makes it the better family game where everyone can peacefully build and tend to his own city, keeping an eye out for what the others are doing without engaging in any sort of all-out bidding wars. 

EDIT: Does not scale with more players at all. We played a six-player game and it fell really flat.

If you are into puzzling, take a proper look at Alhambra. At your turn you are trying to obtain a nice palace and see if it fits somewhere.
The trick is to purchase the goods with exact money because then it won't cost you an action. The money comes in four colors and that is a nice mechanism.
I think this game is a really nice one with only two players.

In Alhambra each player is trying to build the awesomest Alhambra.  I hated the game after my first play.  I've since played it a couple more times.  It's random enough to make the game feel pointless at times.  The puzzle aspect is fun.  There's a bit of player interaction in trying to grab a tile before your opponent does.  Randomness plays heavily in being able to do so.

On each player's turn there are four different tiles available for purchase and four currency cards face up and available to draft from.  Cards of various colors and denominations represent the currency in the game.  The tiles represent various buildings you can arrange in your Alhambra.  Some tiles have walls on some of their edges.  Tiles have to be placed such that the walls line up properly.  This gives the game its puzzle feel.

On a turn a player can draft a card or buy a tile.  Tiles can only be bought with a specific kind of currency.  If you have a bunch of yellow money and your ideal tile must be paid for in blue money you are out of luck.  You don't get change for your purchases, but if you pay the exact price for a tile that action doesn't count as your action for the turn and you can keep playing.  Tiles and cards that are scooped up are replaced by random draws.  So if you've been saving up yellow money and someone buys the tile you've been eying you better hope its replacement is useful to you.

Players score points three times during the game for majorities in the various types of buildings and for have long contiguous walls surrounding their Alhambra.  Arranging the Alhambra is the funnest part of the game.  Hoping the tile draw favors you is the worst part.  If you are playing a four player game it is possible that three of the four tiles that are available at the end of your turn will be bought up.  This rapid fluctuation of the game state can suck enjoyment out of the game.  

Players can track the cards others are drawing and the buildings they are aiming for to help make informed decisions.  This adds some push-your-luck feel and player interaction to the game.  One game I played had very few blue money cards coming up so when it was my turn I would pick up what few blue cards became available.  When blue cards started to come out more plentifully I started snatching up the blue tiles as I desired.  There are ways to game the randomness and that helps the game rise to mediocrity.

UPDATED: Downgraded from a 4 to a 3.

I don't mind when a player screws me over. I do mind when a bag of tiles or a deck of cards does.


Features two mechanics I despise: Card drafting and majority scoring. What makes this game even worse, for me, is the tile purchase mechanic, since it further limits your choices.

This game was fun and a bit of a challenge.  You take turns buying addition(s) or picking up money.  You may purchase an addition(s)and put it aside, however taking the building back from your pool counts as your turn.  Use this move judiciously.  Buildings in the storage pool at the end do not count.  You receive points for having the most of a color(s) and for having the longest contiguous wall.

I have always referred to this game as the next step after TTR. I find the set collecting is almost identical when it comes to collection cards to spend on the tiles but it also allows you to track what people are choosing and the number value to incorporate that info into choosing when best to strike or wait one more turn.

There is also a little bit of route building by trying to have a lengthy wall surrounding your Alhambra. This proves to be challenging because of the rules for placing tiles along with the timing of when you are able to purchase said tiles.

Also, I love the second Set Collection aspect of the game which is the main way of scoring. Obviously you are trying to have more of certain colour tiles than your opponents and this becomes challenging due to your limited purchasing power based on only being able to buy certain tiles with currency of a specific colour.

For such a simple game it offers many great strategic choices to make and a very nice visual at the end of the game which combines to make one of my favourite gaming experiences.

The upside:

The downside:
-Luck drawing cards, luck drawing tiles, random scoring cards.
-One of those games that playing "better" than anyone else won't get you much closer to winning.

Rating may change, only played once, very chaotic with 5 or 6 players, no real way to plan as no tiles last one time around.  But interesting and well implemented mechanics.  I like the risk/reward of the wall tiles.  Luck is a factor, due to the random tile and money draws.  Rulebook somewhat poorly written, leading to some initial mistakes in gameplay.  But it has promise and I want to play it again with fewer players.

Enjoyable game - it suffers, though, from the turn-by-turn luck of what gets replaced in the money cards and tiles. I like individualized luck, but not in this kind of planning/building game. Vegas Showdown took this mechanic from Alhambra and added to it, while at the same time making the luck component fair to everyone, not just to the player that gets a good tile and/or card come up. 

Played multiple times, and yep - the randomness of tiles, cash, and turn order basically makes a mockery of planning and control of your Alhambra placements. Inferior game. Revising rating down from 8 to 6.5 - while there is strategy in comparing your colors to other leaders, it is not enjoyable strategy to me.
It is unenjoyable with 6 players, and wouldn't be good with 5.

Ottimo titolo, mantiene sempre una buona dose di rigiocabilità, è semplice da insegnare anche ai "non-gamers" (alias "Babbani") grazie ad una meccanica di gioco assai semplice e divertente. Comunque c'è molta tattica nascosta dietro alla apparente semplicità del gioco, strategico da 2 a 4 giocatori, mentre in 5 o in 6 tende ad essere condizionato dalla fortuna. Bisogna sempre ponderare le proprie scelte e cercare di non sperperare quantità abnormi di denaro per costruzioni con troppe mura che poi non possano esser piazzate e così occorre tenere sott'occhio tutte le tessere che escono, razionalizzare i soldi, "affondare" con gli acquisti al momento giusto (non troppo presto), tenere d'occhio le mura... Tanti aspetti, ma tutti gestibili. La tensione rimane alta fino alla fine! Con giocatori esperti si finisce sempre con punteggi molto vicini. Ha dei materiali buoni da un punto di vista qualitativo e dell'impatto grafico… e poi è una gioia per gli occhi veder crescere "sapientemente" la propria Alhambra! Spiel des Jahres... 2003.

This is the game that the expansion-less Carcassonne wishes that it were.  The pace is manageable, the placement of tiles is harder as the game carries on.  Game can swing if one manages more than one extra action in their turn. By building your own area, it feels less like "Mother, may I?" than Carc.

i enjoyed playing this, but it the game definitely suffers from lack of control. there are some tactical decisions to be made, but you mainly just have to hope to get lucky. like a lot of card drafting games, what is available for you to draft determines the usefulness of your turn.  since alahambra is less forgiving than say, ticket to ride, the negative aspects of this mechanic are highly amplified.

also, the extra actions for buying buildings for the exact amount seems like a questionable design choice.  this system just rewards people who are lucky enough to collect money useful to them, which just serves to further punish those players who are less lucky.

Accessible, fun and fast. Very easy to teach and learn. Even with six players it tears along. I'm not sure there's enough to it, however. Grab a good range of currency and just hope a colour you are collecting comes up at the exact price. I thought it was all luck until, for the first time, a winner claimed he had planned the whole game. Previously winners just bought what gave them a double turn.

Alhambra is one of the older games in my collection. It is a tile laying game, with aspects of hand management and it is a fine example of a game that player great with two and gradually becomes a chaotic mess the more players you add from there. But that kind of makes it sound like I don't like it, and I do. Trying to snag certain tiles before other people do and bemoaning the lack of (insert color here) currency because [i]that[/i] is the currency you [i]need[/i] to purchase that juicy garden tile to take the lead in that category from Bob who is only beating you by five points and if you take it you'll win the game, but wait [i]that[/i] tile will allow you to connect your two long pieces of wall making them contiguous and getting you [i]even more[/i] points... *deep breath*... that is Alhambra.

Medium length and weight set collection game.  My wife is a big fan.  I find it quick and nice and esthetically pleasing.  Probably wouldn't play it with more than 4 as it would get chaotic and hard to plan.

Update:  This hasn't hit the table lately.  Perhaps it's due to fewer ladies at game night, or just because it doesn't hold the depth to draw in more serious gamers.

What can I say about Alhambra that hasn't been said... except that this game has grown on me. I appreciate the draft-like environment, and randomness comes more from money draws than the tiles, though tiles also come out randomly.

With a semi-experienced group, Alhambra can be played in 40 minutes or less; that is the biggest appeal for me.

(25) The first time I played this I had grossly misunderstood the way the "rearrangement" phase worked.  I played with my family and the game seemed to be lacking something.  We had thought you could basically rearrange your entire city for one action, so there was no consequence to poor planning and the game just didn't click with us.  I later realized my mistake when playing the game with other people who had played before, and then I didn't realize it till half way in, the first time I wanted to rearrange (thankfully I didn't make a fool of myself.)  I haven't had a chance to play again since then because I had been somewhat turned off to the game, but it deserves a fresh shot from me.

The perfect mix of strategy and luck. I can see why it's a classic. This could have been a really mediocre game, but the mechanics for gaining extra turns and taking bonus money cards is well thought out and keeps the game interesting. I love a good tile laying game and Alhambra doesn't disappoint.

1/26/12 Update - going to bump this up once more.  It has become a family favorite.  This game has really grown on me over time.  Great game, nice length of play, and good components.  Moving up to an 8.5

7/29/10 Update - I am moving this up to an 8.  I have really enjoyed playing this with my family and both sons seem to really enjoy it.  Now I'm going to have to buy an expansion or two (probably should have just bought the Big Box to start with, but I didn't want to sink too much money into it before I knew I liked it).  I had wrote initially that I worried about the game becoming stale, but so far that hasn't happened at all.  In fact, I have found myself wanting to play it more often as time has gone along.  

6/3/10 - As of this writing I have played it 3 times without any expansions.  I have enjoyed myself each time I have played and look forward to playing again.  This would be a good game to try on folks who aren't dedicated board gamers.  The rules are relatively simple and the playing time seems about right- not too long or too short.

I worry about the game becoming a bit repetitive after many plays, but I suppose that may be why there are so many expansions - to spice things up.

Great family game.  Great 2P game ("Dirk" as a 3rd player and less chaos than with more players).  You buy tiles (rather than just blinding drawing them as in Carc).  You lay tiles in your own city, rather than a common city like Carcassonne.  It also has a set collection element since the largest set of tiles of that color score victory points.  The layout of your Alhambra is also important as the length of your exterior wall, also scores victory points.  It's pretty quick and a lot of fun.  Recommended.

Review from 28th April 2015 at LoB meet at Red Herring.

A potentially good alternative to Ticket to Ride with a set collection and tile laying mechanic that rewards efficiency and planning, with an element of push your luck.

The concept of building your gardens and receiving points based upon having the most of a particular structure within 5 categories is a good one - and serves as an excellent gateway game.

Where the game falls short is in the execution of its theme (Ticket to Ride is so much stronger), especially the poor quality and small size of the tiles. With better quality components and much better artwork, the theme would be so much stronger and enticing for new players to the hobby.

There is an enjoyable family game here - just let down by component quality and artwork.

Após muito ter esperado (e desesperado), lá acabei por conseguir experimentar este colosso, tendo apenas confirmado as minhas suspeitas, este é um dos melhores jogos de tabuleiro que existe! Ainda não conheço as expansões, mas confesso que estou curioso, pois se em Carcassonne fazem milagres, aqui pode ser que também os haja! Não percam...

Very nice game.  Can be a problem with spatial recognition, but just turn the market board towards that player, so they don't have to turn it in their mind to see if it fits.

Christmas 2006- A little cumbersome to set up but quite easy to learn.  Enjoyed the game with 2 players and has grown on both me and my wife.  It has a great mix of tile placement as you build your Alhambra  and card hand management.  One must pick the right instances to pull the trigger to buy buildings with there cards before your opponents and be aware of both your opponents and your own Alhambra as they grow to maximize your point and minimize theirs.

Enjoyed my few plays of this game. Nice mechanic and limited choices each turn which keeps the game moving. Still there are meaningful decisions to make (thought I"m certainly no expert after just 2 plays!)

I put a decent amount of effort into being 2nd in multiple colors and that worked out well for me

I believe this is a game that Kathryn would enjoy and have it on my list of wants. Apparently it will play 2, but with a dummy player. Have not played with the official variant.

People always have a better opinion of a game if they win the first time they play, and I did.

I just don't get why anyone thinks this is a good game. It's not terrible, there's nothing particularly wrong with it (which is why I rate it 5 rather than anything lower) - it just isn't fun, nor does it (to me) seem to give many options for strategy. OK for playing with non-gamers, but there are much better games which are just as light and simple - even Carcassonne is more fun/interesting than this.

Overall this is a great game, but I think it does suffer from some fiddly rules (shuffling the scoring cards into the deck at predetermined points, using a dummy player when playing 2 player, etc.)  For its time, it was a great game, but I think by today's standards it has been outclassed by other "gateway" games.

A great "gateway" game. This, Ticket to Ride, and Carcassonne have been most successful with our non-gamer friends (Ra is another fav as well). Great 2 player mechanic enables this to scale well from 2-4. It plays up to 6 but the game becomes a bit more random and slow. It is easy to teach and learn and folks enjoy playing it right away. A good light strategy game.

RATING: 6
It is a pretty fun game but I do not like the fact that in the base game, there are times when tiles will come up on someone's turn and be purchased before I even get a chance to purchase it. I do not always feel like I am in command of how I am progressing.

A very nice game with cool mechanics. Can be a little infuriating when you set up the borders of your Alhambra "wrong" and you're not seeing the kind of tiles you need. 

As the turns go on, you're very rarely out of the game. Most games I've seen have been fairly close run things right up to the final turn - this is a bit of a plus in my opinion.

Definitely a game I'm usually interested in playing

I really enjoy set collection games and Alhambra is great in this area. It is supported by fun modular expansions that let you make the game as simple or complex as you like. Finally, building your town is like putting together a puzzle and being able to do so efficiently without the use of your reserve is a satisfying mental exercise.

Dislikes
Sometimes the randomness of the tiles and your draw of cards converge with the chaos of being a multiplayer game to doom you no matter what you do. Some of the expansions mitigate this a bit but every once in awhile you just have a plain unlucky game.

A tense, solitaire-like game with simple rules.  I know there is a population out there that enjoys such games, but the lack of interaction keeps me from truly enjoying the game.  Though there's competition between players, 99% of your time is looking at your mat and nobody else's.  Still, it's a pretty good game, revolving around the mechanic "get 1st, 2nd, 3rd place in as many competitions as possible".  However, I feel no emotional attachment to this game--it's hard to get passionate about this game which, though a solid mechanic, has very little interaction and whose ruleset can be summed up as "a game about making exact change".  It's like doing interesting math puzzles--kind of fun, but not something you'd do with a group of people (or at least, I wouldn't).

Man, boring. Who thought of exact-change as an exciting game mechanic? Jeez. Play seems pretty mechanical. Balance your coins so you maximize your opportunity for exact change. Buy based on what other people have and what will score you the best. Since wall-shape and tiles will come up basically randomly, besides getting an even-spread of coins, strategy is almost nil. 

Duller than watching people who are bad at golf play golf.

A hard one to comment on. I haven't really enjoyed a game of Alhambra yet, then again all the sessions have had too many players (4-6) and I've had all the bad luck in the world. But if I ever get to try it with 2 or 3 players (and do reasonably well), I'm sure the rating will rise. Too many players = too much randomness.

Compared to Stimmt So!, the wall and tile arrangement options give a bit more to think about in the game.  But this might not be a good thing as it can also increase turn length.  As there is nothing to do between turns other than observe/count cards, this might cause the game to drag compared to the more basic Stimtt So!.  Rating both similarly for now - see which one gets more play going forward.

Played once with 6. Control was difficult, but I'd play again. The concensus seems to be that it's better with fewer players.  ** update**: played again, with all the expansions, except the characters, which I was advised didn't work. A lot to digest in one go, but a decent gaming experience. ***Downgraded basic game to 5.

15-02-2015. Rated after 2-3 plays. In Alhambra you build buildings from a central offer. 

You can buy a building tile, or get money cards (multiples as long as their sum is below or equal to 5) in multiple colors, or switch a previously built tile towards your personal supply, or build a tile from your personal supply. The twist is that if you can match the cost of the card exactly (money always must be the required color) thus if you do not overpay you get an additional action.

I did like Alhambra, but with 5 it ran a little long. I can see myself playing this more with 3 or 4.

Felt like there was too much to think about each turn which made the game more stressful and frustrating than fun and enjoyable. 

Not only do you have to think about which tile you can afford with the proper currency, you simultaneously have to think about how it will fit in your Alhambra and how the tile compares with those of your opponents for scoring—and that’s all before even playing a hand.

After a while the game stopped being about purchasing tiles and became just finding ways to arrange the tiles and trying to place the tiles from your reserve. 

Player interaction felt pretty minimal.

The package (I have Queen Games version) is plush, big cards, thick tiles, well put together.  My buds are asking for this one all the time, so I'm looking forward to more play.  There are a couple of mechanics at play in the game, and I always enjoy playing.  Just a good all-around game.

Note that I have played four times with four players, and three players for the rest of my games.  Three seems to be the sweet spot, but four was excellent as well.

Haven't tired of this game after more than a dozen plays.  Great fun.

I enjoy this game, although I believe the move from the city to the holding area, or from the holding area to the city is too costly.  I think a player should be able to rearrange all tiles for a move, instead of just one.  But in any case, this game is fun and i enjoy playing it.  It requires analyzing what your opponents are going for, so you don't get caught up in a war for specific tiles. Also, luck is involved - players can't control what tiles will have to be bought with which currency and when.  Sometimes you just have to be in the right spot at the right time with this game.  And I suggest only buying tiles if you have exactly enough money - this allows double turns. :)

I won't often suggest Alhambra, but I won't turn it down either.  Gameplay is fairly quick (although with too many AP prone players it can bog down) and there is at least a bit of challenge here.  Probably better with 2 or 3 than with more, just due to decreased downtime.

Alhambra is a pretty neat game for a lot of reasons. It's quite simple, in that there are very few things that you do per turn, making the game flow quickly. Making your city is a lot of fun, and beating someone out on a great color makes you feel good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A nice, rightly  regarded family game...

Everybody is collecting different currencies to purchase parts for the Alhambra (a castle/city in Spain). On your turn you may pick one currency card (money), buy a tile and lay it to your already existing Alhambra or take a turn rearranging a tile. If you can pay the costs exactly you get an extra action. There are 3 scoring rounds during which you compare the number of building of each type. The player with the most buildings in each category gets the most points according to a chart and extra points for walls.

This game is easy to teach (maybe 5 min.) and fast with quick turns and low downtimes between players. Seeing your own little Alhambra growing in front of you is very attractive and placement is meaningful due to these annoying walls around some tiles edges... This game has a similar charm like Carcasson - a good entry level...

Only played this once but enjoyed it and tried hard to monopolize on colors which scored the most points as well as to get the longest wall.  I didn't win, but had a good time.  My husband normally likes every game more than I do, but for some reason, this one doesn't appeal to him.  Probably because he needs to be accomplishing something deeper than just placing squares next to each other...did seem a bit monotonous after a while.

Great family game! The unpredictable scoring mechanism adds an element of "press-your-luck" to this game, where you can chose to collect more money to go for that 'Even Money' double buy, or pay an absurd overprice for the one building or wall you need... only to find out you can't place it on your board... 

This game is a lot of fun to play with your family, and it plays in that sweet spot of just below an hour.

Very pleased with this game. A vast improvement over Stimmt So. The walls add variation to the points scoring and are a wonderful extra consideration / headache for city planning. Suddenly tiles of the same colour are more attractive to buy than others due to how they fit the physical puzzle. Players find competition for a tile colour coming from unexpected corners due to the available wall shape. The pace of the game is just right and at the end of the day it's fun. Worth getting a copy for my shelves because it'll be taken down and played often. For me I see an element of Ra in the game that appeals - the pushing your luck / playing chicken waiting game. I'm torn between picking up good sets of money cards so I can bid exact amounts and get on a roll, or picking up a tile that I've just got to have. Plays well with four or less.

RATING: 6
There is nothing very impressive here. The optimal moves are rarely hidden and a simple algorithm yields a honest result:

Can you buy something with the exact amount of money? Yes -> do it; No -> take money.

Add a pinch of: Is a scoring about to take place? Yes -> take that building that gives you the majority; No -> don't bother.

Ok, maybe I am over-simplifying everything, but you get the idea.

The game is enjoyable with 3 players (even the 2-player variant is not too bad) but it gets worse as players are added, as everything becomes way too chaotic... and too long. I remember a 6-player game that nearly made me drop gaming nights altogether...

The 3-player game wasn't bad. I don't think I'd want to play with more than that, though...too much chaos. In the end, I just didn't enjoy it that much. I can see why it won SdJ, as it's totally family friendly and easy-to-learn. I would play it again as a quickish filler, but I don't think I'd suggest it, and I sure wouldn't want to add any expansions in.

RATING: 7
Provisional rating.

Finally played this as a three player game. I've owned it for a long time, but the two-player rules seemed atrocious (ugh, imaginary third player, phtbth), and it never got to the table.

I thought it had some interesting mechanisms. However, it ran on a little longer than it should. The scoring is somewhat cumbersome. You spend a lot of time figuring out which color building you need more and doing the math, or just say to hell with the math because it all works out to 3-4 point gains no matter what you do unless you're playing with folks who don't grasp the scoring.

I do like how the designer approached money management. Each turn you have four buildings available to purchase, and each of the four sits in a currency slot. You must use the correct currency to buy that building. There are also four money cards of varying currencies. You do not get change if you overpay, and if you pay exact you get another turn. Nice. If you use your turn to take from the money cards tableau, you can take one card with any value, or any two cards totaling five or less. Nice. You set up the game with each player drawing money cards until they've got a value of 18 or greater. The player with the fewest cards goes first. If there's a tie, the player with the lowest value goes first. Nice again.

I'd like to play this with four, to see if that improves or worsens my opinion. It's easy enough to learn.

After three plays I can honestly say that I have no desire what so ever to play it again. Nice components, but even for a family game it is way too random. One of very few Spiel De Jahres disappointments for me. 
Update: Played one more time with 4 to see if the game was any better with fewer players (my previous 3 games were with 6.) Sadly, I found no improvement. The game is still terribly random. Randomness itself is not a bad thing, if there are still decisions to be made based on probability or something, but this is just pure randomness. Picking tiles randomly from the bag to build your Alhambra would be as effective and about as fun. But others love it, so I guess it just doesn't click with me. Give me Showmanager or Atlantic Star anyday over this.

This is a pretty fun game, though at times it feels a bit like playing Solitaire.  I do enjoy playing it occasionally, though, and I'm curious to check out the expansions.

Alhambra -- Played four- and five-player.  This has often been compared with Palazzo.  I found the two games markedly different from one another. While the two games share some elements which invite comparison, each game as a whole differs so much from the other that broad comparisons are simply inappropriate.  So (just to be inappropriate), I thought Alhambra was more difficult, in terms of both rules complexity and strategy. That difficulty makes good play commensurately more satisfying. Palazzo, on the other hand,  was more approachable and faster. Happily, we own both.

I enjoy tile-laying games, and the walls on the tiles in Alhambra make the tiles and their placement an integral part of the game. A pretty deep game for one so fun -- Of course, I find constructive games engaging.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1.5
after a year or two of nonplaying I confirm initial observation: 
[u]It's a tile laying set collecting MPS[/u]. 
And that's more or less it. Each player has it's own tableau/board, doing one's own stuff, competition happens via comparison of sizes of sets one collects. 

The good parts: for all the beige and the pastels, the tiles actually look neat and make this game a nice objet on top of a table. Also 2 player option with a dummy player Dirk actually works and adds some welcome tension. 

The bad parts. Well. All mentioned in first paragraph. Also when you think about it the 4 currencies make no sense (apart being in designer's previous game, which served as a basis for this one). 

Verdict: silent, harmless 2 player game. With more people I have no need for silence, and when I do, RFTG or Thunderstone (with theme) will be my MPS games of choice.

a nice game with good system.  It's a lot like carcassonne, but with money, the only thing i don't like is that it has a run away leader problum.

RATING: 6
I enjoyed this the first time I played. After that, I haven't been able to find any interesting decisions to make.

It has some nice parts: nice tiles, good use of colors and patterns, and some choice between furthering your wall or leaving open spaces. But ultimately it comes down to lucky tile draws.

The very mechanic that adds something by having to choose which money to take makes the choice as to what to buy totally uninteresting.

While in theory I can see that you may not want to buy an item for exact change, in practice it doesn't seem like it will ever happen; you'll but it if only to mess up someone else's plans.

Too much luck, little scope for forward planning, tactics too obvious (if possible always pay the correct money, always draw two cards etc). At least it's short. Don't see why it's so popular.

RATING: 7
Played once with 3P. Fairly light and quick. Luck plays an important role as it is always beneficial to be able to pay the exact amount for a building tile, and a majority in a colour can easily be lost there if a series of tiles come up but a player is unable to purchase them. It still is an enjoyable game to pass 45 minutes or so.

2009: 7. Lots of recommendations for this game and all the awards convinced me to pick it up and give it a try.  But in my gaming groups, it did not seem to generate the same amount of excitement and passion as others.  Neat mechanics, but perhaps too abstract, and starts to really break down with too many players.  Eventually sold.

2016: 7. Played again recently, and while I still won't bring this back into my collection, I will happily play someone else's copy. :)  It's a pleasing puzzle-y game for me.

My high-ish mark for this game probably gives away my preferred strategy-level (ie not too deep) but it's deceptively subtle and doesn't encourage card-hoarding in the way Ticket to Ride does.

RATING: 5
[7 plays] Have played with 5, 4, and 2 players with the dummy player. 

Luck of the tile selection, luck of how the walls are configured on the tiles, and luck of the money available - ALL play a major role in this game. The extra action for exact change is a big advantage, so getting lucky here can lead to compounding your luckiness (i.e. I get a tile for exact change, I get another tile for exact change, and then I pick up more money to further increase my odds of having exact change the next turn. WoooHoo!) 

Alhambra is a tactical contest with 2 players, but it isn't a deep thinker where you might feel bad if you do poorly. With 4 or 5 it is a social game without much need to track events or strategize between turns, because stuff changes too much before it gets around to you again.

Good points for some people may include some interesting mechanics, quick turns, majority scoring, limited screwage, and quality components. But for me, it's just 95% a tactical contest strongly dictated by random events.

I'll flat out admit that I dislike the game, and it tends to leave me cold. In my most recent game I didn't play smartly either, so I'll take some of the blame and hope I didn't spoil anyone else's experience with negativity. Other people enjoy the game, and for the most part that baffles me, but I don't mean to lessen their enjoyment. I'll almost always gladly play games my friends and loved-ones enjoy more than me, but perhaps I should just stay away from this one so that I don't ruin it for other people. Weird, I guess this is a rare game that sparks such a negative reaction from me.

Most recent play 6-16-06 with Michael, Alex, Corey, and Garrett.

Not the masterpiece that I was expecting but a fair game (durn if that Spiel Des Jahres doesn't raise expectations - despite "Villa Paletti"). Anyway, a very good game with up to four players but a lesson in annoyance with more - it takes so long to get the things done that by the time your turn comes around, the whole game has changed - uh - three times over. Having two major random elements (currency draws and building tiles) and such a wide range in values (money from 1 to 9, buildings from 2 to 13) leaves it open for irritation when you get a lot of bad draws. Overall, a good one but, frankly, I think "Clans" was the game of the year. Great components in the Queen edition.

Tile-laying, Majority Scoring. Nice lightweight game of buying and arranging tiles into your palace to score for majority in each tile type, as well as for long walls. Chance due to the tile and money draws, but plenty of room for good play in choosing which tiles to buy, how to buy them and how to place them.

Traded. Literally sat on my shelf untouched for 7 years since last play, so it went out in the great collection thinning purge of '12.

Alhambra is a great social game. In the game, you build your own Alhambra (palace) by purchasing pavilions, towers, gardens, etc. and adding them onto your sprawling complex. These components are purchased with four different types of currency, which you collect from a pool of four available cards. The palace-components are drawn from a bag and randomly placed on a little placard where each component aligns with a different kind of currency. On any given turn, you may take a currency card, OR purchase a component, OR remodel your palace. However, if you manage to purchase a palace component with precisely the correct amount of currency, you may take another action. The game has three scoring rounds, during which players with the most of any particular kind of palace component receive points. Alhambra restricts a players choices enough so that the game doesn't become a brain burner - after all, there are few available choices on a player's turn, and one or two usually stand out as optimal. Despite this restriction, Alhambra manages to be tactical and strategic at the same time. Every turn, you must make the best choice given your options and your ability to forecast the next few moves - but you also need to look ahead to the later scoring rounds and attempt to establish dominance in a few different areas (gardens, towers, manors, or etc. etc.). It is too bad that there is usually such an obvious right choice on a player's turn, as I think the game would be enriched by some heckling and cajoling ("You should *really* take that manor. What a steal, and look, it will give you such and such benefits.") - which if successful, would then provide the cajoler with preferred options. But Alhmabra doesn't lend itself to this kind of interaction. There is definitely a lot more control in a two player game. Adding players decreases the amount of control a player has, and decreases opportunities for skilfull play. I enjoy playing this, but it doesn't compel me as some other games do.

Lapkalerakós, egyszerű szabályokkal rendelkező igazi családi játék. Egyértelműen hárman a legjobb, 2-en talán túl egyértelmű, hogy mit kell tenni, többen pedig a játékidő nyúlhat meg és teljesen más piac alakul ki, mire újra sorra kerül egy-egy játékos. Sokak kedvence, nem véletlenül. A töménytelen kiegészítő csak színesíti az amúgy sem unalmas játékmenetet. De valamiért minden jósága ellenére sem fogott meg.

[2011-06-06]
Ahogy már korábban is írtam nem fogott meg a játék, de igazából nem utasítok vissza egy partit sem vele, mert egy jó játékról van szó. A kiegészítők hatalmas számú kombinálási lehetősége pedig tényleg sokat jelent, bár szerintem az alapjáték önmagában is jó.
1-es, 2-es és 4-es kiegészítő minden elemével sikerült játszanom. Számomra magasan a 2-es kiegészítő viszi a pálmát, abban mind a 4 részkiegészítő tetszett. Az 1-es és 4-es közül talán árnyalatnyival a 4-es tetszett jobban, aki egy kis csetepatéra vágyik egyértelműen azt válassza, aki viszont kis titkosságra annak az 1-est ajánlom.

[2011-10-16]
Sikerült a 3-as kiegészítő összes elemét is megismernem. Ezek után pedig már egy meghatározható rangsort tudok felállítani az első 4 kieg tekintetében. A sorrendem 2-4-3-1. A BGG-n adott pontszámban a 3-as és 1-es között nem tettem különbséget, de érdekes módon az 1-es sikerült talán a legrosszabbra. A 2-es pedig egyértelműen a legjobb.
Nagyon sok kiegészítővel játszva szerintem sokat romlik a játékélmény. Én 2-3 kiegészítő együttes használatát javaslom.

While an interesting game, I find the color set-up to be frustrating. I realize the money colors and the tile colors are significantly different shades, but I find myself getting them crossed several times during a game-- and often enough during my first games to make it a frustrating experience. The game would also benefit greatly from small score tracks to keep track of each player's level in each color throughout the game-- the way in which players' boards spread out makes keeping tracking of their positions a (unnecessary) challenge.

I think I prefer playing Stimmt So! to this. The building placement rules detract from what is essentially a set collection game; thus, you now have an incentive to buy buildings that won't score you anything only because they'll help you expand. I also find the wall scoring somewhat uncomfortable, as it can add as much as a first-place scoring on the highest scoring building type.

Alhambra was one of my early introductions to European or German-style board games. It's still one of my favorites and probably one of my top five to play with three players. I enjoy the money drafting, the spatial aspect of building the city tile by tile, and the satisfying combos you can pull off by doing both of those things efficiently. Scoring is always pretty tight and everyone I've played this with has a had a good time. I do have the deluxe version with the wooden fountains and it's disappointing that they aren't included in every version since it really helps with both the theme and the game play. If you're wanting a strong, beginner-level, family board game, I can't recommend this one enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Ok, first of all, this isn't given a three because it is a bad game, rather it just doesn't appeal to my sensibilities.  This game frustrates me because it really is only working percentiles; guessing which number combinations will get you ahead.  The only way to be effective in this game is paying exact change and getting the extra move.  If you do this then you can get your building and more money.  If you can't do this you can only get a building or money, leaving you farther and farther behind.  Can be frustrating watching others do this when you can't (or being the only one able to do this while others are frustrated).  Not really heavy on fun factor.  Worst of all, it is absolutely unforgiving. If you make a mistake it can take three turns to correct, leaving you miserable.  In addition to this there is tons of downtime and no player interactivity.  Blech.

Another great game with family and friends.  Easy to teach new people.  Fabulous Gateway game.  Interaction comes from watching other gardens and trying to twart other's plans for controlling certain colours of tiles before the scoring cards are revealed.  Limited but fun decisions are based on selection of money or tiles each turn and whether to risk playing that fabulous tile which doesn't quite fit but which will could earn you more victory points.

This tile laying game reminds me a lot of Carrcassone but without the meeples. In Carrcassone everyone build and expand the same ariea. In Alhambra everyone build their own city. Tiles have to be places in the same direction (you can not turn them to make them fit in your Alhambra). You have to pay for every tile you get with the right kind of currency. 

This is a great game, with more dept then Carrcasonne.

There is with this game a certain amount of built-in frustration, related to the availability (or lack) of certain cards and money. Seeing the tile you need get picked up by someone else because they, not you, had the right colored coins for it, can be annoying. That said, there is a pleasant symmetry to this game that make its challenges and frustrating drawbacks, not only bearable, but pleasant. Nice pieces, colorful layouts.   Straddles the line between a serious gamer's game and one that your mother-in-law (random example) could pick up easily and enjoy. Levels, complexities and subtleties emerge with repeated play.

People who said it's between Ticket to Ride and Carcassone in terms of mechanics are probably right. It is reasonably quick, although usually you could spot the winner in the second half of the game rather easily (unlike either two games). It indeed lack the cut-throating action of those two, either. But it is playable with kids who can use rather random buying strategies.

It reminds me of other games (ZooSim and Attika), but the combination of elements is unique and pleasing. Six players is probably too many; your plans are almost invariably thwarted.

Not confrontational but still gives you the opportunity to mess with the others a bit. My wife and I have played with "Matt" (although we call him Pepe) and like it as a two player. I've read where some people say there is no strategy - just buy anything with exact cash, but that'll leave you cash poor and not necessarily in a competitive postion regarding majority in colors or walls. EDIT: Played five player and actually liked it contrary to popular opinion here; chaotic but fun. EDIT: After more playings I think 3-player is the ideal number due to downtime.

I enjoyed this game, although I had some trouble with the money drawing choice. I had no confidence that I tile I wanted would still be there on my next turn (this was with four players) so I usually ended up just trying to diversify my money cards for the future. I'm not sure if that's the best strategy. As the game owner pointed out to me, things are obviously very different with only two players.

RATING: 6
I guess it kind of works well, but I don't find this very inspiring at all.  Something about it just doesn't flow for me, whether it is niggling issues about the production or gameflow, I'm not sure.  I also don't like how they put six pawns in the game and expect the game to play well at 6, which I can only imagine would be a nightmare.  Anyway, there are too many great games out there to waste my time with this one.  *Update* - Played once more with the Anniversary Edition and the upgraded component quality does add into my decision to raise from a 5 to a 6.  Also, the game left a better impression from my first few times.  I still think it's a 3-4 player game, though, as while the dummy player is not as big as annoyance as some, I still don't like it.

RATING: 5
In Alhambra, you purchase tiles to build your palace compound on your player mat.  Each type of tile (tower, fountain, etc) scores, but only if you have a majority of that tile type in your palace, compared with other players.  There are, however, two catches.  First most tiles have a segment of wall on them, and the tile has to be placed in a defined orientation.  This is pretty cool, as you may want a tower that's for sale, but the wall placement makes it useless for you, at least in the short run. Secondly (and most annoyingly) there are four types of currency in various denominations that come off the stack randomly, and four building tiles that are placed next to a symbol of the currency type that can be used to buy it.  So often, you can be left to draw small denominations and watch the next person get large denominations.  And if you do get into good money, it may be the wrong currency type to help you get the tile you need.  So you're triply victimized by the tile coming off the stack randomly, being plunked  on the next available currency type (not randomly, but quite beyond your control), and by the currency type and denomination coming randomly into your hand.  It's way too much to chance when the main scoring features require advance planning and because it's hard to adapt quickly to changing situations.

RATING: 7
Wonderful game with different kinds of set collection. You have to collect sets of different buildings to score victory points. In order to buy these buildings you have to collect sets of different currency. There's also a great tile placement mechanic. The buildings have to be placed in your Alhambra. Some buildings have walls, which score you extra victory points, but can limit your future expansion as well.
I like getting an extra turn by paying exact cash.
It's best with 3-4 players and usually doesn't last much longer than an hour, and that's an hour well spent,

I don't own this game and I'm quite interested in Granada, which adds a few more interesting aspects. The tiles are two-sided and can be flipped by paying for it. Last but not least: scoring is variable, based on the amount of buildings there are of that colour in each players Alhambra, instead of a fixed number per scoring round.

Initially we were playing the game wrong and I liked it quite a bit! Now that we are playing correctly my opinion has degraded a bit.

However, if you go down the wrong path with your Alhambra and have to rebuild, you might as well quit!

A lot of luck in several aspects of the game and little player control. Optimizing the individual tableaus isn't interesting, and good strategy seems obvious. It appears to be an ancestor of Glen More and should appeal to many of the same fans. I can see why it won the SdJ, but I think it's at least 15-20 minutes too long for the experience it offers.

Played it once in 6-player mode. I imagine it's vastly different with fewer players. It's sort of a cross between Ticket to Ride and Carcassonne. You collect cash in particular colours to buy buildings, and you place those building tiles according to certain rules (i.e. open space cannot be built against walls). Each building is part of a colour group and is scored according to the player(s) with the most buildings of that colour.

Scoring is a nightmare, especially with 6 players. Three scoring rounds (sometimes with prizes for 2nd and 3rd place) * 6 players * (6 colours + plus walls).

It's a tile-laying/auction game. Currency comes in 4 colors. 4 tiles are randomly put on market, 1 for each currency. The tiles come in a variety of colors, and represent various parts of the palace; some tiles have wall sections on the edge. Players are dealt a random mix of money worth at least 20 ducats, and 4 money cards are on display. 2 scoring cards are mixed into the deck (shuffled into the 2nd and 4th fifths of the money deck). On your turn you may buy a tile or take cash (1 card, or several cards summing to <= 5). If you buy a tile and pay exact change, you get to go again. The tiles you buy are added to your palace (following placement rules) or go to your reserve (you may use a later turn to place a tile from your reserve into your palace). At the end of your turn, any blank spots in the market are replenished (game ends if you cannot), as are spots in the money display (if deck runs out, shuffle the discards). When the 2 scoring cards come up, and again at the end of the game, you score based on #tiles of each color in each player's palace; each color is worth different points, and value increases each scoring round. In addition, each scoring you get 1 point per segment of your longest contiguous wall. High score wins.

Best with 2 or 3, I think. Gets too random with 5 or 6, since few/none of the tiles on display will still be there on your turn! O Zoo Le Mio is a much better tile-laying auction game. Palazzo has some similar features, but is also much better.

With two players, I rate this even higher (perhaps a 9); it's one of my very favourites for two.  With more players, however, I find the gameplay gets progressively more bogged down -- I'll only play it with more than three if I'm teaching the game to new players who just wish to learn how the game works.  So if you're looking for a fantastic two or three player game, look no further; if you want more, look elsewhere.

RATING: 6
A gateway-weight game with a nifty little mechanic.  In this game players take turns either taking money from a market of 4 choices or buying a building with their collected money and adding it to their city tableau.

The nifty mechanic I am referring to is that the money comes in 4 different colors and the buildings are bought with 4 different colors of money.  Also, you can overpay for a building but if you pay with exact change you get an additional action, obviously this can be very powerful.  Once a building is bought it is added to your city and each building tile also has walls that need to properly connect to fit in your city.  The buildings themselves come in 6 different types and you are scored based on majorities in these types.

It's a neat mechanic and this is a fine game but I've moved past this weight of game for the most part (and there are gateways I prefer over this anyway like Ticket to Ride and Dominion) and typically look for deeper experiences these days.

Great gateway game! There are four different currencies that you collect buy buildings. There are various placements rules and one part of scoring is how long the perimeter wall is, which also influence strategy of building placement. In addition you are trying to have majorities for the different types of buildings. Bonus is it plays up to 6 players (though I wouldn't recommend it at 6).

Not the heaviest game in the collection, but I love its pace and the push your luck aspect of trying to string together as many plays on your turn as possible, hoping your opponents don't grab that tile you really want before your cards come together. Understanding the tile distribution and what place you will fall into for each color is integral to making this a deeper strategy experience. Great gateway game IMO.

Only played 2-players so far (with the dummy player "Dirk").

Probably need to play it 4-players so we can get rid of annoying Dirk who seems to get a monopoly on the purple ones. Grrr!

Longest wall rule seems to be a bit too powerful, perhaps? 
EDIT - we were playing this rule wrong! I'd misinterpreted thinking only the longest wall in the game got points, where it should be the individual player's longest wall - durr!

In an effort to internationalise the game, names of buildings and of currency have been taken off my version - shame, as you end up talking about money and buildings in terms of colours, rather than dinars, sestersii, pergolas etc. - pity.

This one's not really been what I hoped it would. Wouldn't be too upset if never touched it again, really... though happy to admit that as we've only played it 2p, we might not have had the full experience (though I suspect it only becomes more luck-based with more than 2p).

EDIT: Wrote that original comment a year or so ago - now Feb 2011, and have taken the score from a 6 to a 5. Not really interested in this at all any more, may well trade away...

EDIT: I did!

Solid 8 -- may go up with more plays

May be prone to analysis paralysis with some players because of the number of things you are trying to watch and accomplish simultaneously.  The 1 action per turn except under some circumstances keeps the decision making very tense.

The two player varient is just as fun and solid as playing with more--maybe even better since the pace is quicker.  We've played with 2,3 and 4 now.  Not sure how the game might seem with 6--especially inexperienced players--maybe too slow?

-------

5 years after these initial comments, we pulled Alhambra off the shelf--just plain vanilla Alhambra, and you know, the game really holds up!  Compares very favorably with current games, and was just a fun little game to play.  It shines mainly in the 2 to 4 player range, with perhaps the 3 player game being the sweet spot--I would never play more than 4 players though because it ruins your ability to plan downstream and turns the game to purely tactical.  There is a healthy dose of luck in the tile draws as well as the money flop, but it in no way sets the game, most of the game is truly determined by strategic plans altered by new tactical development.

Considering its longevity, I am adjusting our rating of 8 up to 9.  If you dont have this game it is definitely worth keeping on your shelf--obviously for years!

I am not a fan of Queen Games. I don't like cheese family euros which basically makes you collect cards and gives you one boring action to do in your turn. IT's freeking boring! 

So you might think "then why your rating is 7?". Well the puzzle aspect of building the Alhambra is interesting and thankfully this game has 25 little expansions, which can make it a bit more interesting.

This is one that my wife loves but I enjoy less and less with each play.  On the other hand, I initially wasn't too thrilled with the two-player variant (there's nothing worse than being beaten by a dummy player - sorry Dirk, it's not nice to call you that), but after several plays it seems to work out pretty well.  Over-all, it's a fairly well-designed game, although the fun factor isn't quite there for me.  And the more players you add, the less you are able to develop a strategy and the more you are at the mercy of whatever cards happen to come up before your turn, making 3-4 players the "sweet spot".  I also don't have much desire to get sucked into purchasing all the expansions like we unfortunately did with "Carcassonne".  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 5.5/10

Overall a very good game.  I really like the price-matching rule that lets you take another action.  I also like the placement and scoring rules.  The artwork is also quite good.  Sometimes luck seems to play too much of a role, and it seems like the game is over before you have much chance to do something.  Regardless, I enjoy playing it and it has enough strategy to satisfy me.

RATING: N/A
Fun and easy game also good with two players. Haven't played it with expansions yet, maybe some of them could make it a bit more interesting.

The Hungarian version (probably same for all non English and German version) spoils the theme. The buildings and the moneys have no name so this almost makes the game theme-less. Other than that the design is quite alright.

Tile quality could be better, Carcassonne has much higher quality tiles.

The insert on the other hand is PERFECT! Everything has it's place, everything fits perfectly and they are also very easy to remove. This makes setup time very fast. A drawing-bag is also included (that should be a little bit bigger).

i should specify that i rate alhambra a 9 if played with expansions, and a 7 if played on its own.  the basic game is fun, but the expansions substantially enhance the experience, particularly expansion pack #2.  my group always uses these 4 expansions, as well as some from #3, and this combo is our staple game.  it has maximum variety with minimal extra learning, and really brings out alhambra's greatness as a game.

When I first learned this game, I knew it would work for my extended family. The teenagers liked it, and when I got it out in Wisconsin for the in-laws, it was successful there too. (But the Packers and UW both had big games that weekend so it was hard to get people away from the TV!) It's obviously a light game, but there's just enough thinking ahead required to be able to recognize a good tile when it comes up, either to help yourself or thwart another player. I have the "Vizier's Favor" bundle of four expansions, but we haven't tried them yet.

RATING: 6
Many plays. I have a hard time figuring out any type of long term planning or strategy in this game.  It just seems like I hope to get the right type of "money" to buy a building that will work out.  I don't know I just don't quite get it or what.  There is nothing really wrong with the game I guess.  It plays quick.  I play it with my co-workers they too found the game fair but not great.  Having the buildings randomly come out, and have the money type randomly come out just feels like too many things out of my control.

RATING: 7
4/6/10: A little light, but pleasant and interesting.  I tend to only play with large groups, because few games accommodate 5-6 well, and Alhambra does a nice job without going on for terribly long.  So that has probably skewed my experience toward feeling the game can be a bit random, with not a lot of tactics other than making your wall.  And, on that note, I feel after a few plays like the big-wall play is overpoweringly good, almost too required for your strategy to work out well.  But given my low number of plays, that could just be wild theorizing.  I like the "exact money=extra turn" system, that adds a nice level of calculation and risk-taking without which the game would be quite bland.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
My one and only experience was with SIX players, so take that into account.  That said I cannot imagine ever playing this seriously.  The game was hopelessy random and extreme luck driven, if it played out in 30 minutes or less it might be fun, however our 6 player game took 90+ minutes. People kept on looking and looking to see if there was something they were missing but in the end it appears not. 

BTW - I WON the game handily (so this isn't the typical I was unlucky so I hate it review)

Alhambra rekindled my appreciation for Stimmt So, a game I'd forgotten I liked. I don't think the castle tiles and walls improve the game any, but I don't think they necessarily make it any worse. Some people will like the additions, some people won't. I prefer the simpler elegance of Stimmt So. I like the new drafting rules, and will use them in Stimmt So from now on.

Liked it better than I thought I would.  Certainly wouldn't play with more than 4 as it is a bit slow between turns.  Also, its a fair criticism to call it multi-player solitaire.  Easy to learn, but enough going on to keep you occupied.  Lots of random elements lend to a large luck factor.

Takes about 10-15 minutes longer than it probably should.

My preferred auctioning game, due to the fact that you have multiple currencies, must keep a close eye on the development of the other players (so no multiplayer solitaire here) and have a tile laying mechanic that restricts the tiles you actually want to buy in the first place. However, there is a fairly large amount of luck required to win a game against equally skilled opponents.

6 is too many players.  With only 4 buying options tiles don't make it back to you and you don't have enough opportunity to buy many tiles before they run out.

Great with more players, so you have to keep track of what everyone else is doing and plan accordingly.

[u]Key Words:[/u] Tile-laying - Light - Luck-dependant

[u]Summarized Opinion:[/u] An uninteresting tile-laying game with no compelling decisions to be made, decided by luck of the draw.

[u]My Rating Explained:[/u] Bad. Likely won't play again.

[u]Verbose Assessment:[/u]

I've had two brushes with Alhambra. The first time was a few years back, all I remember is that I didn't like it. The second time was this year, which confirmed my feelings about the game and reminded me of the reasons.

The problem I have with Alhambra is that there are simply not enough compelling decisions to be made to be interesting, and that your actions have little impact on the outcome of the game.

In your turn, you either take money or buy something, providing you have enough money of the correct currency. If there's a nice tile up for sale and you happen to have the money to buy it, good for you. But most of the time, it's hard to plan on this to happen.

So what the games boils down to is taking what's good now, or hoping that something good will turn up by the time your turn rolls around again.

There are no interesting choices to be made about what to buy - some colors are always better than others, and adding more of the same is always better.

Buying something you cannot use right away seems not to be a good idea, so that's a slim chance of some strategy nipped in the bud. The spatial aspect of actually building your Alhambra is obvious, hence not interesting either.

So in the end, there's just not much game left for a gamer to chew on.

RATING: 7
I like this game.  Its really quite easy to play so it makes a great gateway game.  Perhaps a bit too light for experienced gamers, its a solid game that you can enjoy without burning your brain.  I compare it to Ticket to Ride although there is even less player interaction in this one.

Sold in my game auction December 2009

Tile-placing game that's both very simple to understand but also provides an adequate amount of strategy. The aim of the game is to build your own version of Alhambra by placing tiles representing different types of buildings. Despite there being only three actions to choose from each turn, there's still a fair bit of decision-making required as players have to work out how best to place their tiles. Turns are really quick to perform ensuring that the game maintains a great pace. Artwork and components are typical Euro-fare i.e. a bit bland, but the game seems to blend gameplay with the theme very well indeed.

Régóta nem kerül asztalra. Remek játék, szépen összerakva. Mindenki intézi a kis dolgait, építgeti a maga palotáját, de azért mégis figyelni is kell egymásra.

Nem akar több lenni, mint ami, nem próbálja csilivili mázzal elönteni a játékot, mint sok újdonság. Akár egy Atlantic Star vagy egy gondolkodtatós Taj Mahal, tökéletesen működik és van hozzá némi kerettörténet. Remek darab! Elő kellene újra venni.

This game takes the best parts of Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride and makes it into a great gateway game.

Okay, I get the tile building and the ban on rotating your walls and what not. I'll live with the bonus turns for paying exact change, but overpaying does not net you extra turns. What I am having a hard time with is the Protoss-style building methods we have going on. Not only are the buildings preconstructed, you have the option of building them in your reserve and can even move the finished structures later. Next time we play I'm saying "En Taro Adun!" or "My life for Aiur!" after every turn I build something.

I really enjoy Alhambra in all of its dry glory. Fun for all ages but only if you can handle the dry feel of the game. Really enjoy the mechanic of buying tiles and paying exact change then being able to purchase again.

When played with 5 (like TtR) it bogs down horribly.

RATING: 5
Finally got to play this game, and it was not the game that I thought it would be.  I was expecting at least some strategy in the tile laying, but it was mostly a cardplay hand management game to try to buy 'suits' of buildings to maximize your scoring.

It's a fairly light game, which I don't think I'd play first, but could be a nice gateway type game, or work with the right group.

This is one of those rare euros that can actually work with 6 people.  It isn't the optimal set of players to be sure but it can accomodate them.  Easy to teach, only three different actions and explaining walls and the scoring and you are done.  Can be maddening to see someone buy the building you REALLY want and this gets worse the more players (odd of a building going around 6 people is slim).  Still, easy and enjoyable.  It is one of my gateway games.

Love this game. This is the perfect game for my wife and I; she usually dislikes games with elements of "treachery", such as the robber in Settlers. In Alhambra, though you're competing with each other to buy the best tiles, you're mainly focused on doing your own thing.

Despite my co-workers saying "OH GOD, THIS GAME SUCKS!  Thats it I'm changing my rating on BGG" constantly, I enjoyed it.  They have all played it many times, where as it was my first play.  Not to mention being the guy who lost the game and having to put up with the whining.  I did notice the complete lack of strategy as any attempt to plan things is usually shot to hell in your opponents turn.  There also seems to be a run away lead problem.  I don't think its a bad effort or mediocre game by any means like the other two chumps did (or do now).  That being said from the shear amount of bitching I had to put up with it gets a 7.

My gut instinct was that it was a shade too similar to TtR with the ‘currency’ collecting and spending, but in hindsight I think it differs enough with how it’s kinda like mini, individual Carcassonne. I always have a soft spot for ‘boards’ where they are built different every time.

Mainly played this as a 3P, which seems a perfect player count.

A solid gateway game. It isn't my favorite, but it is easy to pick up and plays really smoothly. There are some interesting decisions about whether to pick up a tile that you might have to overpay for or push your luck and hope that you can pick up the cards to pay with exact change to get the bonus action (before someone else takes the tile you want). 

In my experience the place for reserving tiles and then switching tiles in and out from the reserve to your Alhambra doesn't really get utilized. However, this might just be because I haven't played the game enough to see how that reserve can be helpfully incorporated into a strategy.

Clearance at B&N.

Alhambra is one of those games (like Ticket to Ride) where you are having fun whether you are in first place or last.

I really enjoy games where you are building your own "world/city/farm" apart from everyone else. Make the best move for you and see if you win.
This game is great at 3 and 4. Very difficult to plan anything with 5 players.

Tile-placement, hand management, and set collection. Always fun.

Played about 10 times with either 3 or 4. Overall, an enjoyable game. I love how the action strategies can change based on how your opponents choose their action each turn. Also, in the games I've played, a player behind through the first two scoring phases still has a legitimate chance to come back in the last scoring round. Couldn't give it a perfect ten as there is some danger of little player interaction with the wrong mix of players.

This is one of my favorites and I will always enjoy playing. There is a bit of luck involved, and the way scoring happens is not pleasing to some, but I love the idea of having many options strategy wise. There are many moving pieces and a lot of things to pay attention to, but all in all it is a solid game made of two different phases: The card/hand collecting, and the buying/placing of the alhambra.

Spoiled by randomness.  It's just better to draw 9s than 6s most of the time, or randomly be able to make exact change.  It's particularly good if you or the player on your right happen to get draw 3 cards (you because it helps you make change and them because you have three chances at a high value card).  There's cost management in the game, but it's very diluted by the randomness of the deck.

Pretty fun game that tends to be solitaire in nature. Choose money or buy a tile (better pay the exact amount, so you get an extra turn) are your primary choices, so the game ends up being a luck of the draw game, but an enjoyable one at that. 5- and especially 6-player is painfully slow to play.

Alhambra is fast and pretty, although player interaction is low and the scoring is a bit disruptive and chaotic (both).  The 20 expansions in 5 boxes reflect the blandness of the original.  Among tile-laying games, Alhambra is a reliable crowd-pleaser.  For action, it beats the pants out of the stodgy Carcassonne.  The Granada re-implementation is better.

Good game. I like the puzzle aspect when placing your tiles, and the expansions let you customize the game as much as you want.

Update: For a light game, I still prefer Carcassonne and a few others. I also prefer Palazzo, which has a few similarities. Alhambra is not a bad game but I don't really feel an urge to play it much more. Also, I would not want to play a six-player game of this again. It's definitely best with 3 or 4. 

[b]Player Count Verdict: 2-4[/b]
With more players the game just drags, but more importantly, you can't really do any planning. The tiles and cards change too much by the time your turn comes around.

Late Christmas present from my nephew couple years ago.  We played it a lot on a lake trip, where we play games every night.  Have tried to get people interested in it again, but they seem reluctant.  Usually want to play something else. EDIT:  played it again on trip to Florida with son and wife.  Looked at the rules prior to a realized we were playing it wrong, to wit: we thought in original playing of game that the wall length bonus was for only the longest wall, not for every player. BIG differnce in play strategy.  Have revised my rating as a result.

Update: I like California better




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 3
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 3

Played this game a week ago with the family. My wife and son struggled with the concept of the borders. My daughter struggled planning her purchases for points. Need a few more plays but I took to it like a fish in water. My brain just worked with this one. Great components and easy play. This will hit the table often.

I love the 2 player aspect of having a "dummy" hand to compete with.  We seldom get to play games with 3 or more people so that is a great option for us.   I'm a fan of tile based games, like Carcassonne, so this has quickly become a favorite.

RATING: 6.5
It's a little difficult for me to enjoy this thoroughly as the cause/effect relationship when implementing a strategy can be fuzzy. Also, it can be more frustrating than fun due to the 'hard to plan ahead' factor. Still, Alhambra is a solid game when one of my more preferred options won't fit the bill for whatever reason.

The expansions also give you a lot of fun options.

My first 24 plays came in a 17 day period after buying the game.  It was enjoyable to get to know a game that well in such a short time, but I certainly was ready to take a break from it.  

The combination of tile laying, majority holding and cash/hand management makes for a lot of fun.  I tend to hoard cash until I can make exact payments on several items at once, and usually go for the highest cash value every time.  I would be interested in exploring some of the expansions when I decide to come back to the game.

I still like this as a gateway game for groups where some people haven't seen it, but I wouldn't always suggest it otherwise. Only some expansions are worth playing, but at least all five mini-expansion sets still fit into the base box.

update(2015) Returning to this after a long interval, if you ignore all the expansion things, it's actually a really nice little efficiency game.

RATING: 4
This game was rather unimpressive at first, but it grows on me (and not only me) as I keep playing it. 
It has good mechanics that force you to make the best possible decision every round and reward you in the end for your total performance.

What my groups think of it:

1) My girlfriend was initially bored from the uninspiring concept, but it's grown on her too especially when played with other couples that usually like it. I think the game plays it's best in this kind of groups, aka mixed with 4 or 6 players.

2) My main group (average male gamers) prefers pretty much every other game in my collection (ok, every other above monopoly/risk etc). No one was even decently enthusiastic about it after a couple of plays. They find the strategy not deep enough and the interaction poor at best. But they've not trashed it yet. 
Update: After a long time, it's also grown on a player of this group, who now casually asks to play this game. Alhambra spreads like a disease!

3) My parents liked this game from the start. They think it is very relaxing to play.

The game plays differently but equally well as you increase the number of players. With fewer players, it's more about timing your buys. With more players, it's more about card(money) management. 

Update: Granada has kicked this game low.

Was a fan of this game from the first play onwards. Love the mechanic that allows an extra turn if you spend the exact amount on a tile. The 2 player version added a bit of spice in trying to save the embarassment of losing to the NPC. 

**UPDATE** 

Many, many plays have reduced my desire to play this. I'll still play it with casual gamers though.

RATING: 6
This is an alright tile-laying game (although not nearly as good as Carcassonne or Tigris & Euphrates because players don't have much control or many difficult/interesting decisions in Alhambra).  There's less conflict and interaction because players each build in their own playing area.  It is optimal with 3 or 4 players.  I find that it doesn't work very well with 2 players, so much so that the rules require an artificial third player (i.e., Matt), or 5 players, because it takes too long between turns.

The tile laying (like most tile laying games) is quite fun, though there is a serious lack of control with more than 3 players.  Very much a Ticket to Ride feel (if not quite as good) here in the way that you horde resources to snatch up the good tiles when you get enough.

RATING: 7
In the game you're buying tiles to build your city. There's three scoring periods, the first two are semi-random but the third is at the end of the game. The points for these scoring periods increases over the course of the game. Additionally, you get points for every segment in your longest contiguous exterior wall at the scoring period.

In order to buy tiles, you need money. There's a central card row where you can take money in lieu of buying a tile. Money comes in different colors and each color is tied to one of the markets. You have to pay the correct color for the tile in that market. You can either take cards that total up to 5 or a single card equal to or higher than 5. When you buy a tile, if you pay the exact cost, you can take another action.

That's the game. It's a little luck dependent both in whether the appropriate color money comes out, or if the tile you want/need comes out at the right time in the right spot, but it's still fun nonetheless.

[thing=6249][/thing] is a great game for 3 players. More than this, I think the chaos is to big, both in the avaiable money and in the buildings, making strategy in the game almost nill. Four players is OK. But with 5 or 6? Forget about it.

Alhambra's scoring is moderately complex, and combined with the amount of shared information (all information except players' hands is public -- and even then, you might remember what they took), this can lead to slow play from players prone to analysis paralysis.

A tile-laying game although in this one you build in your own area from tiles available in the building market. Enjoyable but the group has never really been very taken by the game; the expansions add flavour but do not seem to raise the excitement. I think part of the problem is there is very limited freedom - there are strict rules for laying tiles. A game that requires balance and patience you need to measure the amount of each of your own buildings against the other players if you want to win.

My wife and I have been enjoying this game. I don't care who wins out of my wife and me. I just want us both to beat Matt (the bogus third player). The components in this game are awesome and the art is unique and very nice. My wife requests this game often, and so that scores points for this game in my book. Alhambra is unlike anything else I've played, which is the type of game I like in my collection.

I like this game more and more over time. There are lots of good things to think about, but not too many. This game continues to be fun after many plays.

RATING: 7
When I play the game I enjoy it but rarely feel the need to play.

I find the basic gameplay--paying with the 4 currencies and the majority scoring, to be lots of fun. I find the ancillary gameplay--geometry of the wall and rebuilding your area based on a lot of fiddly rules and rearranging--to get in the way of an otherwise enjoyable game.

I really like the interesting scoring mechanics of this game.  Plus, the history of the Alhambra castle has long been something of great interest of mine which affects my rating of the game.  Being a classical guitarist, and playing Recuerdos de la Alhambra, and having read Washington Irving's novel, the game has special meaning for me. I hope to travel and see it one day. Extremely jealous of Francie and Seneca for having traveled to see it.

Game is a little dry and quite luck-based. Type of tile available depends on luck and definitely depends on the actions of the previous player. Scores can get far apart quickly as the rich-get-richer syndrome sets in. Recommended only because this can play 6 players.

Three player game is actually a little better. There is better control over strategy and one can actually plan for more than two rounds ahead.

RATING: 7.5
This rating is for one two player and one five player game.  When I was looking at it at Origin 04, I was hesitant to buy this game because the player interaction seemed very low.  After playing it, I think I was completely wrong.  It is true that the player interaction is mostly limited to taking what the other player needs, but I under appreciated how important that can be in this game.  I thought the game was a touch long for my preference in a two player game, and the mock third "player" worked well, but made the setup more complex.  These objections don't apply with more players, and as such, it was a fine game.

This is my group's most frequently played game.  There are normally 4 to 5 of us, so this game provides the right balance of luck, skill and strategy.  Most find the luck to be too large when there are multiple players but I don't mind, it balances out the skill of more experienced players.  Even my 9 year old nephew can play, although he hasn't yet learned to adjust based on what other players are buying.  The only drawback is the social interaction tends to be low, little more than intermittent comments like, "[paying with] exact money" or "gah, I wanted that".

The one thing I like about Alhambra is that dummy third player in the two-player version seems to actually *work*, even if its scores aren't really competitive.  While it's an okay diversion with two or three, run far away from the six-player game.

Alhambra mixes market buying and tile placement into an interesting mix of elements.  Each turn, you have the option of taking money from the money market (you're allowed to choose one "money" card out of the four available or multiple cards that add up to five or less), using your "money" cards to buy a city tile (there are four available, with different costs), or rearrange your tiles within your city (because there are some very simple placement rules for where you can place your tiles within your city, a la Carcassonne).  That's pretty much the entire game.

There are three scoring rounds throughout the game where you compare your city to other players and are awarded points for having lots of particular types of districts (each tile in your city is a district) and a big wall along the outside of your district (most tiles have a "wall" along their edge).

Right now, Alhambra may be the most popular game in our game group and is the clear favorite of one of the female members of our group.  It has been pulled out at every single gaming session we've had recently.

I'm not sure how it will hold up to a ton of plays.  Although each turn you're given a choice of four options from the "tile" market and four choices from the "money" market, the random drawing of each provides two fairly strong sources of randomness into the game that are largely outside the player's control.  Usually, when a game has a strong dose of random, I tend to get tired of it more quickly.

I would recommend Alhambra to anyone who really enjoys the tile placement elements of Carcassonne.  Alhambra retains the joy of drawing random tiles and placing them to build a larger structure, but introduces a "market" element to, in my opinion, improve on the random "draw one, then place it" aspect of tile placement in Carcassonne.

This game was good, although it is quit re   petitive. Their is only a couple options for each turn, and you pretty much do the same thing over, and over until the sore card comes up. Although, this repetition does not really bother me as much as it usually would, due to the fact that I really appreciate the concept of the game, and the strategy.

I can't see breaking this game out with anything but 3 players.  Any more than that and the game becomes more chaotic than I enjoy and I feel there is little or no control.  That being said, this game is great for 3 and will usually be a suggestion when I have that many players.

RATING: 7
Collect money cards to purchase buildings and expand your Alhambra - a middle-eastern walled palace complex. Straight-forward gameplay with a decent amount of strategic options along with the usual level of luck (through random card and tile draw) inherent in good gateway games. Mixes hand management, tile-laying, and set collection mechanisms. Plays 2-6 but seems best suited for 3-4 players. The Vizier expansion is a good idea at 4 players and helps to mitigate the flaws of the 5-6 player game.

Mostly 3-player.  Some 2-player and some 4-player.  Not surprisingly, I feel that  there is a loss of control with more players (and thus less satisyfing).

Great game!  I own the big box but can say without a doubt that you do NOT need the expansions.  If you are only playing it once a month (or less), the base game has plenty going on to keep it interesting.  We have only really used 2 modules from the big box (gem currency and the currency exchange cards) and would still enjoy the game just as much even without them.

It took me a couple plays and several expansion editions to really enjoy this game.  It would sit more like a 7 on it's own, the base game is overly simple, but it works wonderfully as a gate-way, family or couples game.

Enjoyable tile placement game with a solid puzzle element. Nicely textured with good play mechanics. I could see how some would complain about the solitaire feel of it but our group didn't mind it all. The nature of play lends itself to a casual style of play. To top it off, I like the game's look and the components are good if not incredible.After one play with four players, I looked foward to playing again. And then I played it again. And again. And looked forward to doing so again! Then I calmed down and realized this is a game I will always own and will always play given a chance.

In Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex. On a player's turn, a player may 1) take money from the open money market, 2) purchase a building from the building market and either place it in his Alhambra or reserve, or 3) engage in construction and re-construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player's Alhambra or reserve.

On the other hand, I also think that is simple enough to learn to make it a decent gateway game.

I can see the concept, I can feel the aura, I can hear the drums beating in the distance, but what can I say?  This game just does not do it for me.  For one, luck plays a HUGE role.  Many times you'll watch your grand strategy go to rot as the wrong card is pulled from the deck.  Think rummy on steroids, and you'll get the basic premise of this game.
Edit: After a recent playing, I'm compelled to knock it from 6 -> 5.  The game just leaves me COLD.  I hate my towns, my walls, my money, the whole 9 yards.

This game is very similar to stimt so.  Currency and game mechanics are basically the same.  The difference is instead of stocks there are tiles in different colors.

RATING: 6
Poster child for the lighter SDJ winners that are appropriate for family gaming with a little bit of strategy.  I didn't really see much innovative here, which I was a little disappointed in.  The city building aspect was disappointingly like Carcassonne, and the picking up money aspect was like any of a number of designs, most notably Alan Moon designs like Union Pacific or Elfenland.  The one unique thing about the game was the exact change necessity, which is intriguing, but not enough to set the game apart on its own.  Furthermore, I'm kind of worried that it mostly leads to a luck-heavy experience where having the right currency amounts for the cards will determine the winner.  Doesn't really seem like there's much of a learning curve here.  After your first game, you know the general strategy.  From there, the decisions are largely tactical.

Nem hiába lett az év játéka - kiegyensúlyozott játék, ahol a győzelemhez legalább annyira a mások városának alakulását is kell figyelni, mint a magunkét.

Előre tervezni nem árt, mert a városfalak hossza is pontot ér, viszont be is tudjuk vele szorítani magunkat.

RATING: 5
After 11 games, I can say this is a quite good game. It doesn't really work with 2, 5 or 6 players, but with 3 and 4 it is quite good. Even with 3 or 4 players there might be quite a lot of downtime and the luck plays a big part in the game. Nice game to play, when there are people with different experience on boardgames. But if everyone is a skilled veteran, there usually is something better to play.

Updated after 13 games and dropped the rating to 5: The game is quite boring, because the downtime is big. You can little bit plan your moves during other players' turns, but usually everything changes and you need to think your moves again. This is quite time consuming if there are unexperienced players. Ok game as an introduction to new players, but absolutely not necessary in my collection (nor yours, if you some other gateway games).

I love this game!  With expansions and without.  I particularly enjoy tile placement type games which probably explains my enjoyment of this one.  Received as a Christmas present in 2005 and in constant rotation since.

The expansions add a great deal of complexity and additional decisions that make the game even more fun.

Dirk Henn; Alhambra is the latest update to the stock market game Stimmt So!, only it has been completely re-themed with a Moorish theme and has an additional tile-laying component. On a player's turn, they can do one of the following actions: 1. Draw one or several currency cards. 2. Buy a tile from the market by playing any number of currency cards whose value equals or exceeds the number on the tile (no change is given) in the appropriate currency. Exactly matching the tile value gives the player an additional action. At the end of the turn the tiles must be added to the Alhambra or placed on the player's reserve board. 3. Alhambra construction. The player may move one tile from the reserve board to the Alhambra, from the Alhambra to the reserve board, or exchange the exact position of one tile in the Alhambra and one in the reserve board. When the each scoring card appears, the game is immediately paused and the appropriate round is scored. After scoring buildings, each player then scores the longest wall in their Alhambra. The third and final scoring is played when there are not enough building tiles available to refill all markets on the building market board. The winner is the player with the highest number of points. Expanded by: The Vizier's Favor, The City Gates, The Thief's Turn, The Treasure Chamber

Interesting variation on a stock game.  The balance between the currency, the walls, the majorities, and the "second turn" mechanics make for a fun, challenging game, but luck CAN play a large factor into the game.  It's best to play the game with three (four at the most) to eliminate the chaos that can go into how much changes between your turns.  The 2-player variant is OK, but in our games with those rules, we never saw a need to give a tile to Dirk.

Alhambra feels more like solitary optimisation problem solving than a multiplayer game to me. I don't experience any relevant form of interaction. The only reasons the other players seem to exist is to eliminate some resources and to determine/randomise the amount of victory points I need to achieve. A die could serve for that purpose as well. Weird.

Though I think a solitary variant of the game could be fun to play from time to time. When I come together with my friends I would definitely go for other options.

Not bad, not great, but sort of lacking interactions with other players. Yes, sometimes someone buys a tile you want, but most of the time it feels like you're playing all by yourself.
Edit: After 10 or so plays, I must say I kind of grew fond of Alhambra, even though I was intially unimpressed.

Good Strategy game - a little slow. A very unique scoring method that makes it a little interesting. A lot of the outcome falls to the luck of the money draw.

RATING: 4
Unfortunately, the sheer level of randomness in this game spoils most of the fun. Although I am a keen gamer, I was beaten severely on several occasions by total noobs simply because they drew the right tile/had the right amount of cash and I could just watch. All my elaborate plans regarding scoring were mercilessly squashed by the luck of the draw. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a bit of randomness like in Space Hulk or Twilight Imperium, but these games have flavour galore and good tactical/strategic planning is what matters most at the end of the day, unlike with Alhambra.

I'm not impressed about this game, it has a nice mechanic, that's for sure, but I always get a sleepy mind during this game, it lacks tension and a possibility to explore more than two ways of playing it.

RATING: 7
A fairly simple game that combines set collection, card drafting and some tile laying. It's similar to Carcassonne, except that it has a currency system which allows you to select tiles to buy instead of drawing them at random. The market also has an interesting mechanic that permits players to take extra actions during their turn if they can pay for their purchases with exact change. It's a weird rule, but its presence adds strategy and a few more difficult decisions to the game's rather simple tile draft.

RATING: 5
Solid introductory game, not dense. Cultivate your strategy (plainly) and roll with what the deck throws your way. Got my father playing, and in-laws too. Very instructive to see what real-estate acquisition reveals about character.

RATING: 4
There's nothing really wrong with this game, I don't think. Mechanically, everything is fairly sound; the only complaint I have is that, like Vegas Showdown, it's a game that offers you many choices but the means to do few of them, so it becomes a very tactical game masquerading as a strategic one. But, while I'm not crazy about VS, I at least had fun playing that. I generally like Euros, and while some have gotten stale for me quickly (Thurn & Taxis), this is the first one I've played where I just felt bored, and like I was just passing time rather than having fun. And a SdJ winner to boot! I guess I just didn't find the decisions particularly interesting. To compare it to VS again, you had a pretty good idea of what was going to happen if you bought or didn't buy a premium tile because of the reference card. In Alhambra, there are so many tiles that you really don't have a lot of basis for predicting what will come out next. Instead of "do I want this tile, or do I want to wait to get the next one that will come out, which has an X% chance of being better for me?", it just turns into "do I want this tile?", and the different forms of currency mean that, even if you did memorize them all and figure out exactly which ones you needed, there's no guarantee you'd actually be able to pay for it. I don't know. I thought I would like this game a lot, and was very disappointed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A light tile-laying game with interesting scoring.

The flip-flop scoring track can be a bit tricky, as you have to be careful which direction you're going when you count; sometimes it's better to just do the math, and then put the token directly on the number rather than count.

My third favorite game in the Alhambra family after Gardens of A. and Dice of A.  The game can be very frustrating while navigating the two layers of randomness (cards and tiles) in order to build one's Alhambra wonder.  There isn't much interaction between players either which makes whining about bad luck a heckuva lot less fun.

Competing for majorities in room types and building out a long wall quickly while still leaving your palace open to expansion sounds like the makings of a good tile laying game.

Getting a free turn every time you purchase a room with exact change is such a powerful effect, however, that it overshadows other considerations almost entirely.

Played once,  seemed like a good game.  Double-loading the colours for both tile types and money feels like a poor design decision - someone has to double-emphasise that the money and the things you buy are not related at all.

Surprisingly - for me, as a game without strong theme - very addictive title. Maybe it might me boring after many plays but I think it will rather keep attention as every game is quite different (scoring in different game progres time, deficiency or excess particular color of rooms, changing player's strategy). And 2 player's variant with - not disturbing - virtual player really works well.

Played with 3, enjoyed the game greatly. Choices to do multiple things as there are alot to think about - the colours everyone has, the buildings in front of you as there are building regulations in regards to walls, as well as the building which are available for purchase. 
Definately more control with 3 as you can plan ahead and will most likely be a lighter fare of played with more than 4 (gane should accomodate 6) look forward to play again

Won as a prize at Spill-o-rama 09 for running one of the tournaments. Good game. 

update: played quite a few more times now. Great game with solid mechanics. Sometimes you feel like you don't want to buy and are forced to take money. After watching the TV video reviews of the expansions I can see that they would certainly solve that problem.

RATING: 6
Too abstract (why is there many kinds of currency and why can the currency be taken for free) and lightweight for my taste but racing to gather funds for acquiring a piece that an opponent would have also needed was fun and exciting. For me the aspect of building my Alhambra was what saves this game.

It's simple, fast flowing, somewhat interesting and fun when you are screwing others' plans, so no wonder it has become a classic. Scarce but interesting interaction, few strategies to try to follow if there arent too many players. Nice mechanics of doubling your move that keeps it interesting.

We introduced this game at Christmas to my very non-gamer soon-to-be-in-laws.  They loved it.  I really enjoy it as well.

I'm a big fan of tile laying games and this one does it well. A bit too random at higher player counts (nearly all the market tiles have rotated by the time your turn comes around) but works great with 3-4.

-- Sold: 10/5/17 - Was just too long at the higher counts and there are better tile builders at the lower counts (Isle of Skye all day!)

Have played this a 1/2 dozen times. Good light weight to medium with my gaming group. Competitive without making the more sensitive of the group feel that everyone is out to get them. Most games seemed to be pretty close right up to the end. I am trying this one out with my wife.

Update: More play and this continues to be popular with various people I game with. It is fairly light but I still enjoy it. I may need to decrease my rating slightly due to the amount of downtime with 4+ players. My wife likes this and I find the 2 player variant works pretty well.

Reminiscent of Carcassonne, but the money cards add a different element, and the limitations on your choice of actions each turn mean you have to think ahead too.

Like Carcassonne, the base game doesn't work well with more than 4 players, but the expansions can help with that, as well as shaking it up. Just great fun to play.

{ P - [3] 4 5 }

I half-heartedly bracketed '3' players because with reasonable memorization you can know precisely what income cards both your opponents have and thus what they are able to purchase exactly, though this "perk" is really just a pyrrhic victory considering the rote memorization substitutes one dull experience with another. Conversely, playing with five the game is pure agony and little more than collecting two colors, walls and hoping the folks going right before you flip the tiles you need in the colors you're collecting. Random tile replacement, random money replacement, random distribution of leftover tiles, interim scoring at random times. Arrgh.

A fun and interesting step up from Carcassonne. Still deciding luck versus skill balance (although all skill and no luck makes "Jack" a dull game). Doesn't beat Carcassonne as 2 player. though. Note: I wish MORE games would use cards for money rather than flimsy paper (thinks - Powergrid, Santiago etc) Update: I have some decent poker chips now which I tend to use for any games that have paper money in them)

An excellent tile laying game, with four very good expansions. Each of the expansions introduces 4 new elements to the game, with the Vizier's Favour expansion being a must purchase. The other expansions are nice to have, but playing the game with all the elements of all the expansions is not advisable: the game can become a bit long-winded and unfocused, and some of the elements do not work well together, or could be combined.

okay tile set collection and placement game.  it is entirely dependent on having the right money/tile available when you have the right tile/money.  watching someone consistently get extra turns because they happen to have exact change is NO FUN.

RATING: 7
Alhambra has relatively interesting game mechanics. The choosing of currency cards and building market ensure high replayability. The scoring of connected walls also gives players the unique challenge of constructing an Alhambra that maximises its length.

However, the luck component of it can be pretty "in your face". This is with reference to which currency cards and building tiles turn up on the market, as well as what building tiles are given to Dirk if it happens to be a 2 player game. It sometimes gives players the feeling of loss of control.

This has been a perfect game for our collection (resource managment, tactical play, some luck element, puzzle building...). This kind of seems like Carcassonne meets Ticket to Ride...  You purchase tiles with sets of money cards to build yourself a city.  Depending on how well you manage you money and how well you plan your purchases and city layout will determine your score. All in all a very solid game that I am always happy to play.

A tile-laying game very reminiscent of Carcassonne, but very different in the way you acquire the tiles as well as to score them.  I didn't do very well in my first session of the game due to my shortsightedness to only focus on one color, in addition to investing in pieces that didn't allow me more freedom in expanding.  However, I enjoyed it enough that I have been wanting to introduce it to my family.  I think it will be a worthwhile purchase that will get played very often.

RATING: 6.8
A pleasant little game.  By the end, the players' decisions get a little tougher.  You can pretty much play this game in absolute silence, but the game offers some fun anyway.  With six players, you pretty much have to scrabble for every tile or bit of currency you want; with two, the game automatically becomes a little more strategic, especially with "Matt", the fake third player, who reminded me vaguely of the Bohnenmafia in Al Cabohne, right down to players being able to feed him, in order to frustrate their human opponent.

We purchased this after a really HARD week.  Is it bad that buying board games is therapeutic?

We've really enjoyed this one so far.  The dummy player really makes a difference and I think it was very well done.

Edit: I think that the reason I enjoy this game is due to how well the different mechanisms mesh together.

It's okay, but like many other games from the early 2000's, is starting to show its age. I still like the monetary aspects of multiple currencies and the advantages of exact change, but if I were interested in a city-building (err... building-building?), there are better options. If someone were excited to play there wouldn't be too much arm-twisting, but it wouldn't be my first suggestion.

Not bad, but not as good as expected. I usually don't mind when there's some luck in a game, but not when it lasts more than a hour. In most of the games I played, the winner was the player who managed to buy many buildings at the right price (having the right card at the right moment). I find that the game plays by itself : you take that tile at the right price even if you don't need it. Using the Reserve is too penalizing and it's hard to make good use of it. There's nothing to do whhen waiting for your turn. It's hard to plan ahead with more than 3 players because the board changes drastically. Oh well... I love the design of the box and game components.

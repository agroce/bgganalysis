I have fond memories of this game. It was very well designed for fast and skillful play with no rules or mechanics cluttering it down.

RATING: 9
At one time, Games Workshop produced some high-quality boardgames. This is one of the best, a real see-saw battle that always goes down to the last dice roll on the last turn.
Being somewhat of an old-school purist, I prefer this cardboard-counter version to the new 3-D miniatures one that Fantasy Flight Games is working on, Still, if you can find a copy of either, get it! You will not be disappointed.

Impulse buy when I saw GW was making "wargames".  I picked it up used at a flea market, and should have guessed some important counters were missing from this "complete" game.  Will never, ever play it, I'm sure.

RATING: 6
Back in the days when Games Workshop decided to drop the idea of actually making games,  3 games were released including this one.  Different people have their favorites but for me this one was overshadowed by the other two.  I've never played the expansion for this one.

Would you believe I've owned this for over 10 years and have never played it?  Of course, for 8 of those years, it was at a friend's house, but hey... I should have played this by now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good, old fashioned low complexity wargame...it's all meat and potatoes here, if you've ever played any hex-and-counter game you can practically play it without even reading the rules.  This is a great intro to wargames, really since it's so easy to pick up and play.  The 40K theme is cool (even better with out having to buy all those blasted miniatures) and there's some fun little chrome things and a pretty neat way of handling production and turn sequence.  All in all, good fun despite some fairly shallow unit differences and a sort of wonky CRT.  Waghh!

I bought all the [b]Wargame Series[/b] games from GW when they came out. I enjoyed them all, more obviously for theme than anything new or different about the game play. Of them all Battle for Armageddon was the most playable -- although I always felt the lack of air/space power was unfortunate.

RATING: 7
Great component quality. Plays much the same as any WW2 hex and counter game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun as hell.  A very simple game with lots of atmosophere.  What it lacks in replayability and some imbalance - such as overpowerful Ork cards and poor victory conditions - it makes up for as a perfect introduction game to non-wargamers.
Score based on at least five plays.

RATING: 7
[Johnson] Honestly, it is one of the best intro wargames out there. And if you're strapped for cash and have a good printer/cardstock, it is free to boot! 
 
Medium-density East Front WWII game is behind a thinly veiled GW veneer. The marshes and mountains and rivers have new names, but it's all there: Sevastopol, Moscow, Stalingrad, you name it.

Uses classic attack/defense/movement ratings on each chit, and a not-too-forgiving CRT that has a lot of retreat results. Even has a basic supply system! Honestly, it has got to be the best intro to wargaming I've played yet.

Had a printed out version from Games Workshop online.  It would've worked pretty good as a block game, but I didn't have blocks back then.  An interesting game from the Workshop, but all games from them are suspect.

Ebay find. I also have the Chaos Attacks expansion, where you can add Squats (space dwarfs) to beef up the Imperial troops. And the Orkd get to extra tribes to choose from. Fun and simple "The Russian Campaign" for 40K, Great theme, and as opposed to TRC, the counters are large and easy to read. Short setup time, too. Highly recommended!

Best from the series of Games Workshop wargames. Like the others the components are of superior quality.
I like the building/attrition part of it, and the game seems very balanced (dispite very dissimilar forces).
Perhaps I played it a little too much though...

Old-style wargame offering from Games Workshop, featuring a war between Orcs and Imperials. The game is of course really a World War II Eastern Front game in disguise. :-) Nice and colorful components.

This is a very good game, even if its replayability might not quite match its price. No matter whether you're a 40K fan, or just a board wargames afficionado, this fine design has something to offer. PLAY IT IF YOU CAN! ;)

The best board game GW did, IMHO
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Simple and slightly innovative rules where you choose what two actions (out of move, attack or build) you will do during the turn secretly at the start of it using cards. Beautiful but unimaginative map. The counters are bland but functional. Combat resolution is by CRT.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of Games Workshops' better boardgames.  Players are given a great deal of control over their sequence of play and the event cards supply a certain amount of scripting.  Otherwise a great deal like Barbarossa - an initially strong Ork force that slowly degrades as it pushes farther and farther into Imperial territory.  The midgame arrival of the Space Marines allows the Imperial player to launch his own vigorous counterattacks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Battle for Armageddon is pretty much a game about Operation Barbarossa with a Warhammer 40K theme. It's got just a couple of pages of rules which are all very simple and basic. But the combination of the tiny bit of chrome for the theme and the strategy card system and the (somewhat swingy) special cards still make it quite interesting to play and the playing time is also quite reasonable. To me that makes it a perfect beer and pretzels wargame. I really enjoyed it.

A good fun, with super atmosphere, but with some unbalance. After the orks invaded into the land, their supply routs need too much units. We play with some house rules, for example Special Card "Cannibalize" and unit "Supply Caravan".

An excellent GW game simulating one of the many battles for Armageddon.  This one is space orks vs imperial guard and marines.  Can the orks punch through and exploit their numerical and speed advantage before imperial reinforcements change the balance of power?  Great fun, esp if you like Warhammer 40k.

Perhaps it's nostalgia that makes me enjoy this game, but I'm yet to have a game that I haven't enjoyed. That said, the fairly random nature of combat often has me howling in dismay.

Not the most balanced game ever but lots of fun trying to stave of the hoards with your stacks of marines and titans. A good base mechanic that with more testing could have proved a real winner.

A surprisingly good boardgame by GDW. Good quality pieces, and not too many. A very interesting initiative and pre-planning system that always keeps you wondering if your strategy will fall in with the timing of the player sequence. Every turn seems to have the potential to break the game wide open. Time limit of 8 turns, so there is always an ending to each game. The Chaos Attack expansion provides some alternative Ork tribes to try out, as well as the Chaos forces & Space Wolves for an interesting game with a different feel.

A terrific introductory wargame with all the flavor and fun you'd expect from the oft-maligned WH40K universe.  Thinly disguised reworking of the classic German invasion of Russia in WW2, the unexpectedly fresh cardplay sequence method works wonders on this well-trammelled ground.  Both players should be well aware of the special cards though, since strategy often revolves around them.

RATING: 7
Nice, super-thick counters and cards, nice colorful, board-mounted map. Counters are easy to read. Rules are short and clear. Great GW WH40K theme.

Game is a light hex-and-counter wargame. Six special cards per side add some randomness and extra strategy to the game. Plays fast (under two hours) and many compare it to an Eastern Front WWII game, with Orks being the Germans and Imperium being the Russians.

Game is now available for free download, including the Chaos Attack expansion that subs Chaos counters for Orks and Space Wolves for the Space Marine counters.

RATING: 9
Just played it. I made strategical errors, but was really good fun. Easy to learn, great mechanics and doesn't go on forever. Downside is that probably after a few plays the game is biased towards the Imperial forces. Still, some great mechanics in there!

OK, but so limited it doesn't really seem like it'd bear up for repeated play. Subject to reevaluation. "Orks on the Eastern Front" is at least a fun concept.

RATING: 7.25
Some clever concept's make up this wargame. It is enjoyable, quick to play, but still requires some planning. Rules are easy to get to grips with as well. 

The combat results Table is a fiddly cumbersome outdated beast! Counter artwork could have been better.

RATING: 7
I'm fond of this topic (I've played a huge number of Space Marine games) so I like this game a lot. The funniest thing about this one is the "russian front" similarity with ork invaders and imperials defenders.
If you like the topic you can give it a try, it's a funny game.

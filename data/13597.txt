RATING: 7
A fun game, kind of Tichu-lite, except easily played with two or three. Because it has fewer exceptions, easier to teach than Tichu. Gang of Four is a bit easier, because of the stoplight ordering of suits.

(I never know whether or not to mark standard-deck card games as "owned".)

Learned this from a Japanese guy when I was going to the JC.  Me and my friends misremembered (and/or purposely altered) the rules enough that it was basically a different game, but this is the closest I've found to it. 

It's been years since I've played it, but I'd still wager to guess that it's my most played game.

Not a bad game for when you're caught without your Tichu deck.  But it lacks partnerships, which makes it much less fun for me than Tichu.

RATING: N/A
Starting in high school, my friends and I had an insatiable appetite for this game.  We would play it every spare moment we had.  I don't love it so much anymore.  While there is a lot of luck, the better players will usually win.  I just find it a little too boring.  It's more fun when money is involved!

RATING: 9
I could be biased as this is a game I've played a loved since childhood.  Someone said that this is "Tichu Light", my understanding that Tichu is but a variation on this game!  There are many card games that are of similiar mechanics played in Asia, and Tichu, Gang of Four, and the Great Dalmuti are just a few examples of commercialized version of them.

Rating is as a family game—I'm currently using this as "stepping stones to the temple of [i]Tichu[/i]" for my two sons.  So far it's worked like gangbusters as a short, fun just-before-bedtime family game.  My next scheme is to suck my dad & brother in with penny-a-point games...

Note:  I chuck the deuce-as-top-card nuttiness and just teach it ace-high with "standard" card ranking (and refer to it as [i]Step on the Little Guy[/i] rather than [i]Big Two[/i]).  Clears up a LOT of confusion for newbies this way.

RATING: 7.5
Mar09: Well technically it's for Big Three, but I'm using this space for all non-Tichu climbing trick games.

The same decisions are there.  Do I break up that run or not?  Do I bother with throwing down that high card already?  How long can I keep the lead?

Big Three's scoring is a little fubbed up though.  I definitely think I need to bring over the goodies from Tichu for the scoring.

Can't go wrong with this goodness though.

Same more or less as Gang of Four though there are many variations of this one, a good non-partnership climbing game and not as good as Tichu. Tichu has more to consider but note is partnership and I think better in that form.

Another Asian gambling game. Played this a lot in Singapore between lectures.

RATING: 8
This family of games has many variants. I like those that include card points. We play something we call Oasis where captured fives, tens, and kings and going out early count for positive points. As in Tichu, we also play with a high card and a wild card that cost points to capture and give points to another player, respectively.

Known as "Chor Dai Di" to some people (in Malaysia), this is a quick poker-style game where your objective is to get rid of all your cards. OK for a game or two, once in a while. "Owned" because its playable with a deck of standard cards (and I do have standard cards, don't I? Hmm..).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
(Aka: Choh Dai Di.) My favorite Asian climbing card game--and with an ordinary deck of cards.  The commercialized copies like Gang of Four and Tichu don't gain anything over this "straight up" public domain original. Plays fast with lots of brinkmanship. The "climbing" part is an addictive mechanic. You need to develop a strategy, but then also quickly adjust  when your opponents ruin everything.  Those dismiss as too simple forget the original lends itself to many regional variations with wildcards and bombs and is rarely played "straight". See also its many other Asian cousins, e.g. Tien Den, Zheng Shangou, Zheng Fen. Best with four, since card counting is integral, but scales well with 2-6.  For partnership, try Shangou, or adapt Tichu's special cards with jokers; for 3p, try Fight the Landlord; for 2p try: 13 cards per person, each player gets a joker she can use at any point; or Haggis, for a deeper rendition.

I don't think I'm a fan of climbing games, though this one gets points for using a standard deck and not having too much eccentricity (plus some elements like suit and rank ordering and direction of play can be adjusted to taste without affecting gameplay).

08-27-2014 - Meh, card game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
1 play against AI

ten rounds. Won 7, 2 and 1 card left in two other rounds.
However one round i was stuck with 12 cards.... I only manged to get rid of the three of diamonds.

One AI scored constantly low numbers and won two of the three other games i didn't win so he barely beat me.  When somebody else played a flush he could play two in a row. He finished with a pair.

Perhaps that is my biggest problem with the game. There was nothing I could do about it.

Anyway very easy to explain to people who have some knowledge of cardgames.

I would be interested in trying to play this as a partnership.
I'm not sure it would work. but just to know what it does to the decision making..

NS against EW

I played this one first time in Barcelona 2009. The girl who teached us called it "Capitalist", but after reading the rules here on BGG... yes, it's the same game. I've played Gang of Four many many times (and I've even owned it) so Big Two was very familiar to me. But it is worse than GoF because the smaller deck and not-that-exciting card combinations (I mean, it's harder to get "bombs"). Still, an okay game if you have some beer and snacks... :)

Even better when played for money or dares. Keeping score is mandatory. Another good variant to play is "asshole" - where the winner of the last game gets the loser's best 2 cards and gives back any 2 cards. 2nd place exchanges 1 card with 3rd.

I guess, since I own an ordinary deck of cards, that I 'own' Big Two, technically, as that's all it is.  A decent enough game when you're playing cards, but I've played cards so much as a kid it bores me now.

A classic card game.  This game is a lot of fun and can be played with a standard deck of playing cards.  Similar to Tichu.  Best played with 4 people.  Lexio is a tile version of this game (with slightly different scoring and support for 5 players).

It seems you can get burned quite badly from the deal.  When you're stuck with a bad hand and not much you can do with it.  I know that sounds like the boardgaming snob's standard whiny excuse for *any* card game, but I *like* card games.  I'd rather play Frank's Zoo.  You've got more options there.

RATING: 7
So much better than Tichu - lighter but a lot more fun. No joker abilities to remember - no bombs out of order, no playing 10 card straights.  No pasted-on scoring, you're just striving to be King of the Hill each round, not the ***hole, works at several player counts, and players can drop in and out.

This is a good game but, with 4 players, I'd rather play Tichu and, with fewer players, I'd rather play [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/37628]Haggis[/url]. If I were to rate this game strictly, I would have to give it a 3 or a 4 rating as I would seldom or rarely be willing to play when the aforementioned alternatives are on offer. But I do like the change of pace of playing for yourself rather than for the team, I like the variety of choices provided by the set of playable combinations, I like the variety produced by the differentiation by suit, and I like how difficult it can be to deal with stranded singles. However, as with Gang of Four, I very much  dislike the scoring system - you can see my reasons for this dislike and my suggested alternative scoring system [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/34429/item/734155#item734155]here[/url]. I haven't tried the game with gambling, pay-off type scoring yet, which I think might enjoy more. If I just ignore, or put aside my dislike for the scoring - or, better yet, play with my replacement system - I can enjoy Big Two as a good 3 player climbing game that provides a quick fix for my Tichu addiction when there aren't 4 players to be had and we only have a standard deck of cards handy (Haggis for Three requires a 5 suited deck).

[size=7][i]Note: For three players, we play with the 3's removed, and deal out all of the cards so that each player has a hand of 16.[/i][/size]

I've had more fun with Zheng Shang You, and other Chinese card games. Even Tichu beats this. Probably the simplest Chinese card game out there. The 4-player requirement is crippling, especially when you consider that you can play a partnership card game instead with 4.

Used to play this for push-ups. 2 push-ups for every card left in your hand when the first person goes out, 4 for every big 2. Build muscles!

Though I've never played it face to face, I've played it on the computer, thanks to Thanosgames. It's a very addictive "climbing" game that simply requires a normal deck of cards. Granted I've never played Tichu so I can't compare. Still free is hard to beat.

Grew up playing a lot of this. So much more interesting than the weaker 'asshole' and other simpler variants, and still pretty simple to play. Plays well 2-4 players, possibly more with a second deck. Armed with a standard deck of cards, this is my weapon of choice.

RATING: 8
We play a game that's basically a hybrid of Big Two and Thirteen (aka Tien Len), which are already very similar games.  Our hybrid is better than both (:p), but closer to Thirteen (with "bombs" and "chops"), so I give my higher rating there.  The two-as-high-card element does add something though, since it sets the highest card apart from runs (i.e. you can't make a K-A-2 run, at least in our game), adding an interesting little wrinkle to the game play.  Overall, a very good, very fast traditional card game, with lots of opportunity for creative play.

Bidding game using a usual deck of poker cards. It utilises the rules from poker, in addition to some of its own. Identifying the sets that make up a drawn hand is vital to doing well, as is picking the opportune time to make the bid. 

Short playtime is another plus point of this game.

Used to play a lot of this during my university days.

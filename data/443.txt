Excellent logic puzzle/deduction game, but the limitation of only answering the question you draw means that between players of equal skill the game comes down to the luck of the questions draw.

Ultimately, this is not my favorite type of game because I make rash assumptions. These games ultimately are a game of patience and accuracy and not deduction (as much). Although the tiles are color friendly (as the box exclaims), the questions cards still reference colors - so not the best. However, I could tell the colors apart in good lighting. The game is well produced, but not for me.

A beautiful (mechanics-wise) deduction game.  Love it.  Plus, it's easily made at home, with better quality parts than the long OOP components (I've seen some beautiful sets made simply with color-printed labels and mah-jongg tiles...like mine, for example).

A solid deduction game that will never leave my collection. There's a little luck involved in that some questions barely help while others are very helpful for you but over the course of a game it seems to even out. It also can be a bit unforgiving if you guess wrong but that's the challenge.

Abstract deduction game which really makes you think hard. It's difficult to piece all the info together but very satisfying when you get it right. Production quality of the new Stronghold edition is very good.

I found myself not wanting to play this after the initial plays. Seems it's just not my kind of game. Traded it away.

*whistle* False start! 5-yard penalty, repeat 1st play! Oh boy, what a mistake. Apparently I misinterpreted the ease of the deduction in this game and my family's reaction to deduction games of this nature. Let's simply say that we barely made it through one round, and at least 2 of us had no idea what to write down on our note papers. It was a disaster! The game is a bit like those logic problems you find in puzzle magazines. You know, the ones that say "Sally does not like Vanilla or Chocolate ice cream. Dawn prefers less than 4 scoops of ice cream. There were at least 2 scoops of strawberry." And then you have that grid of boxes where you start marking off clues to slowly narrow down the answer. It's deeply analytical, and not what I'd describe as "fun" in the context of a game. Now I'd play again, but I'll certainly never subject my family to it again. Long story short, it's on my trade list if anybody wants it. Consider my rating only a testament to my lack of desire to play again, not a reflection on the quality of the game (which I can't accurately determine considering we only played one round.)

I played this logic game with a youngster at BGG.con.  He taught the game really well and beat me at it too.  I suspect it would get more interesting with more players as each player at the table would be gathering information from every question but their own.  I enjoyed the play and I'm really glad I had the chance to learn this one.

Interesting, short and simple enough to class as a filler (and with the luck element one would expect of such a game) and yet with a brain-burning intensity of deduction that you don't expect.

Never outstays its welcome (unlike Sleuth for example) and good for teaching logic.

RATING: 7.5
Nice relaxing deduction game in the tradition of Cludo/Clue

No control over the questions asked makes it a lesser challenge than Sleuth or in particular Deduce or Die but still spins the deductive wheels to have a place when playing with casual / non gamers.

If you love logic games, you will love Code 777. Prior to this game, my logic game of choice was Sleuth. However, Code 777 does a great job of overcoming some of the faults in Sleuth without becoming too difficult.

Pros:
-Challenging enough to keep your interest, but not so difficult that it lasts forever.
-Great mechanics. Unlike other games of this type, when it is your turn everyone else gains information and you gain none. Thus, you spend the majority of the game gaining information and when you aren't gaining information, you are engaged in answering the question on the card for everyone else. The effect is that you are rarely bored - waiting for other players to collect information for themselves.

Cons:
-Wrong answers ruin the game. Since the game is based on deductive logic, if the card reader incorrectly answers one of the questions on the card - it will throw everybody off.
-Mistakes are unforgivable. What I mean by this is that if you incorrectly annotate information or make a logic error without quickly realizing it - you are doomed to start over collecting information.

RATING: 6.5
An okay deduction game that I'm still trying out.  Someone who solves their first two racks quickly and gets a 3rd rack of tiles is from the initial tiles seems to have a huge advantage.  Also, some questions (more than others) seem to give up a lot more information.  Need to play again. -- UPDATE: I'm not fond of the restriction that the cards put on the game progression because you draw one card to be your question and you have no choice of questions (like Sleuth, Black Vienna or Deduce or Die)... you may narrow things down to the point that only one or two of the 21 questions is meaningful... so you then have to sit and wait and hope that you draw that question card (ugh!).

There is a really good game in here, but if you make a mistake somewhere along the line, you're entire sheet is a mistake and you can't recover.  One thing worse than player elimination is a playing when you have no chance and you have no idea what is going on.

This is a brain burner, and if you mess up a guess you throw off everyone's calculations as you have to reset your own board.

Absolutely my favorite deduction game.  Ever.  Pure deduction, but still having to cope with getting the information in a way you don't control.  And OMG, I've just discovered how devastating shuffles can be if your note taking isn't good enough.

P.S.: NOT a good game to start at 2 a.m., unless you like to watch your brain melt down.

The odd questions create an interesting logic puzzle to solve. And those odd questions are what raise this from an average deduction game to a very interesting one. Instead of getting to ask questions that will help you figure things out as quickly as possible, you end up with an assortment of information that forces you to analyse the situation from more than one angle.

The downside to the game is, due to randomly drawing cards, it is possible that the questions you pose will not provide information. Pair that with another player lucking into questions that provide lots of information and it can become quite difficult to be competitive.

In the end, I feel that Hanabi is the better deduction game with this "feel", length, player count, and complexity.

Deduction fan that I am, I really should like Code 777, but it just doesn't work that well for me. Something about the combinations of being hindered by the cards and not quite getting how things work. I should put more time into figuring it out. K really likes it so I'm unlikely to get rid of it.

Playing all 3 rounds, it becomes a pretty difficult game, for me at least. There is some luck in the questions that are asked, and I think the game might be better if you got to ask others the questions you want, though this might make it too easy, and you'd need pretty strict rules on types of things that could be asked. Pretty good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice pure deduction game - but it certainly isn't without flaws! 

First of all, as it's a pure deduction game I don't really like that the usefulness of the question cards is extremely varied and you can really get screwed if the other persons answer questions you don't need at all. In one of my first games I had only 4 numbers left so only had to remove one, but 4 questions in a row didn't help me whereas the other players got help when I answered cards. Furthermore, it's easy to make mistakes in this game if you don't tread carefully! Even if it isn't intentional, it's easy to make a mistake which will ruin the entire game... 

Still, I think it's a good deduction game (even for 2!) and I am certainly going to play it in the future.

My personal recommended number of players: 2, 3, 4
Best with: 4

I really like this game, though I've dropped my rating a bit.  Lately, I've started to wonder if there isn't more luck in this with just waiting for the right card to hit.  Oddly, it seems like the more you play and the more skill you acquire, the more luck-dependent the game becomes since you become better at maximizing the info you are given.

Rated 7 after one play. Solid deductive game for families and non-gamers. I actually messed up slightly some of the rules (when to refresh the tiles) during the first game, but generally speaking, this game is easy to teach.

Part of me wonders if after a handful of plays experienced players learn how to deduce their numbers relatively quickly. I haven't reached that point, however. I am excited to try out some ideas for better deducing!

Update: 2nd play with just my wife and I. We certainly got better in our 2nd play. If you track tiles before you reshuffle and refresh the entire pile, you can sneak in a quick 2nd successful guess.

Update: Well, sold this away at an auction event held at a gaming convention. Three plays and some reflection quickly convinced me that this was not going to see any table time with my family. It just didn't provide the "oompth" that some of my better family game options provide.

RATING: 7.4
This deduction game was a pleasant surprise.  While it seemed far too difficult to narrow down your code at first, with time you could figure out how to make an educated guess.

Each player has a 3 digit "code" which faces away from them, that they are trying to narrow down by eliminating which tiles they know they don't have - by looking at everyone else's codes, and hearing answers to select questions on the cards.  While the order of those questions adds a bit of randomness, most of the questions will be helpful to the players.

It's a clever classic - just different enough that I want to keep this in our collection.

I'm not sure this is actually a game per se - unlike many deduction games, you don't choose what questions to ask. You're just exposed to more and more information (not under your control) until you decide to declare that you know what numbers you have.

But: the deduction itself is a great deal of fun!

Highly recommended tweak: after a player pulls new tiles, immediately mix the old ones back in. Otherwise, as the tile pool starts getting small, there's way too much information in circulation.

Makes my brain scream in mortal agony.  I enjoy Sleuth and Black Vienna, because it's possible to have a notational system.  But with this game, you pretty much have to write each question down, and each answer and then continually review that information.  Plus, when people guess their numbers and they're wrong, the information you had disappears/changes...  Icky.

Great deduction game...best deduction game ive played to date. Unlike most other games that are marketed as deduction games, Code 777 is ACTUALLY about deduction. MAJOR WARNING: you MUST read the FAQ and adopt the suggested variants for shuffling tiles. If you play using the rules provided in the game it becomes broken. Not an exaggeration.

My real rating is an 8...but i couldn't resist :p

Update- black Vienna is a better deduction game, but this still is very worthy of ownership and table time.

Intriguing and rather collectible game where players are trying to crack their hidden code.  You can see your opponents codes, but not your own.  Information is revealed through a series of questions that are answered by your opponents.  Deduction kicks in and guesses are announced.  Good game, but if someone makes a mistake in their answers, the fur will fly!  The new edition from Stronghold Games looks nice, in the over sized box.  A couple of odd rule changes - the most obvious being the reshuffle when down to 1 tile in the draw pool - grab the old rules to play a more challenging and better game.  The slipping tile problem has thankfully disappeared, and everything is nice and chunky.  The yellow tiles is very pale under artificial light, and red/pink look quite similar - make sure you point this out when introducing new players, otherwise some incorrect answers may result.

[Randolph] Superb, heavy deduction game. Each player needs to deduce the three numbers on their own stand from the clues given by their opponents.

Surprisingly unengaging deduction game which isn't any better than Mastermind, the only difference here is that multiple people can play.   It's easy for the game to become ruined by somebody seeing a tile accidentally, especially when playing with kids.   The scoring system is goofy.  Starting over after each round is the only way to make it work right.

I really wanted to like Code 777 more than I do.  I think the components are cool, the idea of the game is neat, and the deduction part is just fine.  The whole problem I have comes down to the cards.  Drawing a card that tells you the question to ask can be very frustrating.  Many times you can draw questions that are completely useless, which means you've lost a turn.  I just wish there was some other way to find out about your tiles other than drawing random cards.  In order to scratch the same itch that this game hits, I would just much rather play Hanabi.

The only decision you can make during the game is to make your guess early or just when you're sure you have all the information. But it is a good group puzzle for casual players and families. Perfect components and box insert.

The really interesting part here is the question drawing mechanism. The questions are really twisted and sometimes you need to work quite hard to deduce something from the answer. However, doing so will often reward you... Although your opponent might get lucky and draw an "easy" code but it's good because it keeps everybody in the game until the very end.

It's a little too easy for those with the right kind of brain wiring to play perfectly.  If you have more than one such player, then the winner will be determined by luck alone.  Good fun nonetheless.  It's a nice lighter-style deduction game, a step up from Clue or Coda, but not nearly as challenging as games like Sleuth or Black Vienna.  Some degree of choice over the questions asked might make this a more skillful game - but it might also make it far too easy.

[Initial Impression: 5] Another deduction game where you're constrained by the questions (see my comments on Sleuth for thoughts on the genre.) The fact that the pool often gets reshuffled makes it a bit more challenging, but this mechanism has two major flaws. 1) If some players often make wrong guesses, the shuffling becomes more frequent and less informative for players who aren't making wrong guesses (is that blue 7 that was just drawn the same one the other player just returned to the pool, or a different one?). 2) Because there will always be seven unknown tiles in the pool, some questions are not necessarily very informative. (That is, you don't necessarily know if a question is answered because a tile is in the pool or on your own rack - e.g., if both the answerer and I can see one yellow 7 and the answerer sees more yellow 7s than 2s, is it because there are no yellow 7s or 2s on my rack, because both are on my rack, or because only a 7 is on my rack?). I find the questions particularly irritating, in that there is no choice in what each player will have to answer and insofar as certain questions can be extremely revealing for one player if that player happens to get a suitable combination on their rack (the value of the questions will not be equal across the players).

Despite (and probably because of) it's abstract nature, this is one of the most fun deduction games I have ever played.  It's very difficult to record all the information you need to, which forces you to attempt to refer to assumptions you previously made.  In turn, this causes errors based on false premises, and the pressure to guess first encourages risk taking which, inevitably, ends in amusing failures!

This game compares well to Hanabi, but seems to have more potential for clever deduction thanks to the note taking and more complex clues.

It works together well enough, but still feels a bit awkward when playing it, especially without color record sheets and other playing aids to keep track of everything. Still fun to play when you want to do some heavy thinking, and don't mind a head-ache afterwards.

Apr09: Now that's a darn good deduction game.  It sets itself apart in many ways:

If gives information to many players at once so everyone can take processing time at the same time.

The answer is very achievable; you will get a correct deduction a couple times per game.

There is just enough room for skill.  The order of the questions can help you out a ton, but the skillful player will have an advantage.  And playing to three points give just the right luck to skill balance IMHO.

This is everything I wished Sleuth was.

There were a couple of problems with my first game that colored my experience.  The game is theoretically colorblind friendly, but the colorblind player we played with didn't match the symbols to the colors correctly and gave an incorrect clue.  It would be nice if the game included the symbols in the questions.  Also, we didn't notice until we were well into the game that you're supposed to use a dummy player when you have 3 players.  I probably should give the game another chance at some point.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (November 2013)

Good game, I was thinking of selling it, but (for now) this is a keeper in my collection. At first I thought it was overly hard to deduce, but the game flows very quickly and I really like it. The rules are pretty easy to teach, but it has some luck in the cards, some clues give a lot of information while others don’t give away any worthwhile info. I have never played Indian Poker, but I love that you can’t see your own hand :D. 

It has the same weakness as Black Vienna, if a player made a mistake the game breaks and it is over.

The game components are great and I especially like that Stronghold added symbols for the color blind, thanks to that we can play this game with two more friends. 

I still prefer Black Vienna over this one, but for now this is a keeper and I want to play again.

After a couple more plays, I realize the first player to get his own code, has a very big advantage as the new possibilities are very few. One should mix all the tiles again I think!

Still I´m downgrading the rating of the game and I also sold my copy. I still think it is a good game, but I vastly prefer Black Vienna over this one and I’m having an storage crisis, so It had to go.

Current Rating: 6.0

2014-02-24

After a couple more plays, I still think that the first player who get his code correctly have an unfair advantage, this can be solved if you always shuffle all the available tiles (not sure if this is in the rules or not, I already sold my copy), however I feel the game is not a hard one, so most of the time, it is the (uncontrollable) luck of the draw in the question deck that gives someone the key to crack his code, so I currently feel it is mostly by luck that a player wins this game. I have to play more, but in my last game a very good player, didn’t get enough good questions to solve his code, but gave a lot of good information. I’m still not sure how much luck affect this game, but I’m downgrading its rating once more.

Solid 7 after one play. 

A deduction classic worthy of Sleuth, Code 777 allows you to observe every other players cards without being able to see your own. You then answer questions about what you can see, and based on any friction between your answers and your opponents' knowledge answers, everyone deduces their own set of cards. Every time you correctly guess your set, you gain a point. First player to three points wins. This is quality social gaming and top-tier deduction to boot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In this game each player has three numbered and colored tiles they can't see. Then players take turns reading and answering questions that give information about the tiles they can see. The other players note the clues and mark the hints on a set of all the possible tiles. Once a player has deduced the hidden tiles, a guess can be made. If correct another set of hidden tiles is taken. The first player to correctly determine three sets wins. Determining your tiles can sometimes be a brain burner, but it is still a lot of fun.

RATING: 6
After one play, not as interesting as I hoped for. Luck plays a far greater role than I thought. I got lucky in getting double numbers twice and another player drew questions that both times let me deduce these double numbers. The rest was easy waiting for the right question to find out the missing number.

Replenishing the board(s) after players' guesses feels not right to me. What should hinder me from not only crossing off what I see right now but also crossing off what I remembered to be on the boards and now in the discard piles. The closer to depletion of the draw stack, the easier the task is in this case.

Note: Play with the original rule of reshuffling the stacks when 4 or 7 tiles are left. Do not look at discarded numbers when the guess was wrong.

RATING: 8
A refreshing twist on the deduction game genre, in that you are trying to find your own three number sequence, which everyone but you can see.  The cards are mixed in their efficacy - some will give away a whole bunch of information while others are not very worthwhile.  When you first hear the questions on the cards you wonder how you could ever guess which numbers are sitting in front of you.  However, with a little bit of practice I find that it goes very smoothly and it even seems to be easier than, say, Sleuth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pretty much the same as the original version.  It's nice that this can support 5 players, and I guess the components are a little nicer, though the cards feel very plastic-y.  I actually find the colorblindness feature to be more of an annoyance because of the symbol in the background, but that's probably because colorblindness is not an issue for me.

I do think that it's a shame that they didn't integrate the chart showing the composition of all of the tiles to the back of the tile tray.  The original version didn't either, but at least it is designed to hold the cardboard cutout.  Simply having a separate card feels like a shortcut to me.

RATING: 7
The first few couple of games will throw you for a loop trying to figure out how to use the questions.  Figuring out a system to keeping your notes might be the most intriguing thing about this game.

The advantages of a game like this is that everyone gets "equal" number of turns (unlike Sleuth where you can lose just because people keep asking you questions).  The disadvantage is that sometimes you get lucky (or unlucky) with the questions asked, and sometimes you are just waiting for a particular question.

A game I owned but got rid of a few years back.  We've been on a bit of a deduction kick lately as our 8 year old is a big fan.  I'd put this back on our wishlist but had mixed feelings.  With no theme and no real decisions it seems the sort of game people who like to take notes would play.  Sort of old school in that regard vs. a deduction game like P.I. By Martin Wallace where no note taking is necessary.  Someone suggested Hanabi instead of Code 777 and we did not like Hanabi at all.  Code 777 is much better.  I'd rather take notes than have to use only my memory!!

The game has 24 questions. These are written in 6 different languages.
That's why I tagged LL0 and LL3
And I choose No necessary language in poll.
Don't be afraid of the languages.
Most people will be able to understand one of those languages.
And it is easy to make your own cards if needed.

This game is playable unlike Cosmic encounter in german for me.

What did I think of it.

We played four games. It is an okay filler for me.
I thought luck would be less a factor but there are a couple of questions that really favour the high numbers.

It is also more likely you have high numbers.

If you figured out you have a 7 and the question pops up does anyone have a set of consecutive numbers the game is over. And the answer is yes and you see noone having consecutive numbers except the questionreader the game is over.
 It also wouldn't be a bad guess  if the game has progressed quite a bit. and you are sure of a 5 or 6.
Since it is more likely you have a 7 than a 4. But probably.


I managed to win one game before it was my turn to ask a question.


Anyway that was quite disappointing to me. I thought the game involved less luck than it did.

Still an entertaing game and it is fun that people feel it is necessary to go for their sequence. and only have one number right when they do.

The best deduction game I've ever played. Code 777 offers couple of interesting ideas: your game isn't over if you make a wrong guess (unusual) and that when you are gathering information for your first card combination, you can same time collect some information for the future rounds as well.
Code 777 isn't the most challenging deduction game there is (Sleuth is a far more harder), but it's the one which I like most - this is a must game for the deduction lovers. For the family evening it's a bit too hardcore - in those cases Plunder is better choice. 
I own the Tricoda-version which is very well made. My only (minor) complain is, that the color choices could be a bit better ones.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The clever little game Code 777 combines the elements of a good, logical deduction game and Indian poker. Each player receives a rack for keeping three tiles drawn from a pool of tiles, which are seven different numbers in seven different colors (28 tiles in total); however, the rack is turned away from you. When players sit in a circle, each player can see everyone else's tiles, except their own. Each turn, players draw a card with a question like, "Do you see more yellow sevens or more blue sevens?" which should help the others' determine their tiles. Once you're reasonably sure of which tiles you have in front of you, you can take a guess — but if you're wrong, you have to start over with a fresh set of tiles...

Deduction games aren't usually my cup of tea but this one was fairly interesting and nicely produced.

LIKE:

* Stronghold did a nice job with the production quality.
* Plays fairly straightforward.
* With the cards asking the questions, the game plays very quickly.

DISLIKE:

* I'm not certain we played correctly with tile discard after making a guess on the number in front of a person.  
* Box is an off shape.  
* FAQ is necessary for reference to make the game more difficult/strategic (IE, use te 4 or 7 tiles left rule and when you guess incorrectly, dump the tiles into the discards without looking at them.)

RATING: 4
As they are, the rules for 3 players (that is, the number of players I normally play with) deliver a broken feeling. The first player to deduce his/her code has a great advantage and virtually always wins the game. 

We, now, play without a fourth rack (i.e. no dummy player) and with a hand of 4 cards for the active player, from which he/she chooses a question to be asked to the player on his/her left. The cards then pass to the next player, who draws a new card and chooses a question, etc. Thus, the experience has significantly improved. 

-------------------------------------------------------
Update: Finally, we concluded to a drafting-like approach, which, I think, works better than the abovementioned. So, for a 3-player game, we use 4 racks and deal ALL the cards, thus each player takes 7 cards. The 2 remaining cards are placed face-down in the middle of the table. The first player chooses a question and asks the player on his/her left. The same goes with the other 2 players. When all 3 players get to ask a question, they pass their cards to the player on their left. The turn pass on the second player, who now asks first, and so on and so forth. The dummy player (4th rack) change tiles everytime ALL 3 players find their code. If a player wants to ask one of the face-down questions, he/she changes it with a card from his/her hand, and the other 2 players choose and look a face-down tile (which they shuffle back with the other face-down tiles).

Game in a Nutshell: Be the first to deduce the numbers on the three tiles facing away from you.

Played as: 3,4,5 player

Pros: It's a different style deduction game than the old clue style format of racing for that same piece of information. Great production values on the newer Stronghold Games edition. I like the tension of trying to solve your own little puzzle and often there's some good laughs to be had as you watch other players hem and haw over what everyone else can clearly see. So far I've found the game experience remains largely the same when scaled from 3-5 players.

Cons: I really don't like how there's zero choice in the questions or answers you get. Just draw a card and answer the question on the card. Too often you'll have it figured out but just need one question to come up to give you the last bit of information you need. It's frustrating playing the waiting game in order to get that one clue and even more frustrating when you end up drawing the question yourself only to know your opportunity is lost and the waiting game will continue even longer. You could have all the deducing ability in the world but go nowhere when the spoon-fed clues aren't relevant to you.

Other: This was a much more casual deduction game than I was expecting due to the high amount of luck and lack of significant challenge. I think if you're looking for something with more layers to peal back and more brain cramps, Sleuth is the better game. This isn't bad though if all you're looking for is just a little puzzle to mess around with.

Best Use: As a "light" deduction game.

A fun deduction game that relies somewhat (in 2-player) on the order of the questions being asked.  4-player does not really have that problem.  Good rubber-banding aspect allows players to catch up while still giving the leader a small bonus.  Penalizes incorrect guesses heavily, which it should.

01/12/2013: After only two plays of this one, I'm enjoying it quite a bit.  Clue is a fairly big hit with my family - especially leading up to my discovery of hobby boardgames.  So I thought this basic deduction game might be a good choice.  Our first play went long as we were trying to figure out how to use the notepad efficiently and how much the questions helped us out.  Our second play was much quicker and smoother.

This is a straight up deduction game...zero theme.  You have three numbered tiles in front of you but facing away, and the first person to guess their numbers three times is the winner.  Two minor complaints about the tiles for me: they are small and difficult to see across the table, and the colors could be more distinct (the red tiles aren't a bold red and they look similar to the pink colored ones, and the yellow color is very faint).  There are symbols on the cards as well to help those who are colorblind, which is nice.  But I wish the tiles were at least bolder if not a little larger.  Rummikub has similar sized tiles, and I think they are perfectly fine.

If you enjoy deduction games, I think this is a solid option.  With slightly improved tiles, this would easily be an 8 rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Solid deduction game where you can see everybody elses codes but your own.  When it's your turn you read a question and answer it based on the tiles your opponents hold (this helps them deduce what their code is).  As the game progresses deduction get's trickier as once a player get's their code correct they get new tiles, tiles are often reshuffled, which can screw with your book-keeping.

Played it yesterday after ages with the stronghold edition. hey guys why are you ruining a good game? Why not print eg. the survey with all German questions on the backside of all English questions. Then you can lay them out all on one side without flipping them over. There are other German Rules than the English for less than 4 players.
And finally why the hell the questions can´t be also formuluated like this: Can you see more stars than rectangles if you are only giving away B/W sheets of paper.    

Now the game itself is very unique and a very good deduction game, but I think Deduce or die seems to be much better and its free

1 play.  I was looking forward to this one but there does seem to be a few inherent problems.  First of all, you must trust what info others give you and a few of the cards can be just a little bit tricky.  I'm a pretty logical, deductive guy and I'm almost positive someone gave me some contradictory information at some point, but by the time I made my guess (and guessed wrong, twice even), there was no way to verify the information.  It's possible I made a mistake once but I have a hard time believing I did it twice.  Very frustrating.  I almost gave up trying.  Finally, on the third try I got some helpful info and was able to narrow it down fairly quickly to make a correct deduction and at least be in the game, although most had made 2 correct guesses by this point.  I guess the key is to be VERY CAREFUL when you give the info.  Not a bad game but I need to try this again to see if it seems to lend to this recurring problem (or determine how I may be making mistakes).

Very ingenious deduction game where players have got to guess their own tiles, open to all other players. The skill of it lies indeed in pure deduction: in their turn, players are asked one question at random which they have to answer for all the others so there's no tactical element at all. 

On the other hand Code 777 has got some very clever features apart from the well-balanced questions: two players can still enjoy the game, (penalised) false guesses are allowed and information about the numbers' values can be deducted from their colours. All in all it's not as complex as Sleuth but ultimately more replayable.

A Fabulous game of deduction! So simple to play and absolutely a blast! I am amazed at this games replay ability. Amazing things happen in this game...it never ceases to surprise me. It is a great 2-player game as well as 3, 4, and 5 players! This game is now one of my favorites to play! This is what my wife and I refer to as a good old fashioned 'Smack Talk' game. Not so much to each other, but at the game! Love it!

This is a great game for deduction fans obviously. But, if you have new gamers that were or are fans of clue...break this one out and they will love it!

Word to the wise...If you have children(or absent-minded adults) and they make a mistake answering a question, it will ruin the game. You do have to answer the questions exactly correct, because everyone is making deductions based on your answer. I have seen entire games ruined from such mistakes.

RATING: 7
An interesting deduction game that's more engaging and taxing than the filler Coda, less fragile than the longer Black Vienna and more interesting and quicker than the similarly card-question-based Sleuth. Your objective is to work out what are the three tiles (from the set of 28) that are in front of you, and each time someone else answers a question about what they can see in the 3 racks other than theirs (ie yours), you're hoping to narrow down what your tiles might be by equating their answer with what's on the other racks that both you and the answerer can see. Cross that off, cross this off, keep track of possible double answers until later questions clarify, until there's only one possible answer ... and score. The game is still slow while everyone tracks their information, so it's for fans of deduction challenges only, but it's one of the better deduction games out there.

This seems like a decent game, but I just can't do it.

I rate this one higher (8) when played with the variant that requires discarded tiles to be mixed in before the first player draws their third set of tiles. Otherwise whoever solves their second set first basically wins the game and the third round is pointless. One of the best deduction games going and I really like it.

First play with 5 and after a few hiccups (poor notetaking method, ambiguity of interpreting clue conditons and confusion with tile colours and symbol frequency) it was an interesting exercise. However, as with Sleuth I'm not a fan of the programmed questioning which although speeds up the thinking by doing some of it for you, I still like the interrogation system in Cluedo, which you can try to use to your advantage (and the freeform nature in Mystery of the Abbey). Also my tastes for theme is stronger nowadays. I'm now wondering if Hanabi may be a speedier and exciting deduction for 5.

An old Dice Tower recommendation that seems to have survived the test of time: a pure deduction game which can appear to be all over the place until you start putting things together and, well, deducing!

Fun deduction game.  Everyone has 3 tiles (with numbers and colors).  You see all your opponent's tiles, but not your own.  You win the game by correctly guessing your 3 tiles 3 times.

The way you get info, is by taking turns reading and answering questions about the tiles that you can see.

This is an engaging game that we've really enjoyed.  It's quite addicting when you first start playing it.

高级版达芬奇密码。玩家随机获得4个板块，板块上标注着1-7中的一个彩色数字。你可以看到其他玩家的板块，但看不到自己的，你的目标是猜出自己的数字。每个回合有一名玩家抽取一张提示卡，并大声回答上面的问题。比如“你可以看到多少人数字和大于12”“你看到的粉丝的7多还是黄色的2多”等等。
逻辑推理游戏的机制差别都不大，把游戏输入转化成线索，用排除法缩小范围。而Code77的亮点在于你要通过别人的“视角”来获得自己的信息，同时他的配件做的非常精美，让人留下深刻印象。游戏的关键在于如何记录有用信息，而不是事无巨细全部记录，导致内容过大无法找出有效线索。如果想体验更高的难度可以试试限时~

RATING: 7.5
This is a simple deduction game. Each player has three random tiles on his forehead, which others can see but he cannot. (Ok, not on your forehead, in a rack.) Each tile has a number and a color. The back of the rack shows you the complete set of tiles. Your goal is to guess your tiles by number (color is used only to help with deduction, but only the number is required to win). At any time you can make a guess. Your tiles are then revealed and put aside. If you guessed right, you get one point. Regardless, you get three new tiles. Winner is first to three points.

Players take turns as a clue-giver. Each player draws a question card and reads the question on it. Then they answer the question based on the other player's tiles which they can see. The questions are like, "Do you see more green cards than yellow?" If the clue-giver makes a mistake, it can really screw everyone up. I think this is rare, however -- when you make a bad guess you immediately think it was from a bad clue, but it's probably bad logic instead. :)

It's a good deduction game, if you like deduction games. There are many opportunities to make some deep inferences here. For instance, when a clue is read, does someone scribble down their notes or did that give them no information? Recent discards can also be eliminated from consideration until a player makes a guess and draws from that pile.

UPDATE Jun-14-2010: Upping rating from 6.5 to 7.5. If I don't find myself getting to play this once at a con I don't feel complete. I don't need more than once, but once is nice. :)

UPDATE July-6-2010: Just received my "home-made" copy of this from Artscow.

Happy to see this classic back in print.  This is a fairly good pure deduction game.  Like most deduction games, it breaks down if people give incorrect information.  I do like the way the pool of tiles rotates, forcing people to adjust their thoughts.  I've still not found a good notation system to address this.  When I get a chance to play deduction games, this is one I usually want to play.  [03/13/2011]

Great logic puzzle game, but really mentally intensive, such that I'm not up for playing it all the time.  It does make you think and pay attention, and I do enjoy the tension of trying to figure it out.  An outside observer of the game would say it moves slowly, but you're really thinking about so much on everyone's turn that it doesn't drag at all.

RATING: 8
Code 777 is a great little deduction game.  I appreciate the fact that it's not as heavy as Black Vienna or Jotto, yet it doesn't dilute the deduction element with card-sharing ala Sleuth or Mystery of the Abbey.  After two coached sessions, my (analytically-oriented) 8 year-old can play competitively and that adds to the fun.  (To teach a kid how to play, it helps to start with a few 2 player games; the note-taking/logic is more straightforward with that variant.)

Thanks to Stronghold from bringing this back into print!  Unless you're colorblind, it's still worth printing out the note-taking sheets available here for use with their edition.

Owned the Jumbo edition for awhile, and quite happily too. Finally upgraded to the Stronghold edition and now I never look back. The plastic number tiles and tile holders, the colour-blind friendliness and the addition of a 5th player make this a must have copy of Code 777. This game is easily one of my most favourite deduction games of all time. It plays elegantly and is, at surface level, less complex than say - Sleuth but well and truly scratches that deduction itch. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Multiplayer logic puzzle, like a competitive Hanabi. I'm good at games like this, which is probably why I enjoy Code 777 as much as I do. I especially like that you can go beyond deduction and play the odds effectively if you're good at reasoning things through. The key is developing an effective, concise notation system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There are numbered tiles (1 1, 2 2s, ... 7 7s). The numbers are also colored 1 of 7 colors. Each player has 3 tiles in a rack in front of them, facing away so any player can see all 3 other racks. The rest of the tiles form a draw stack. There are 22 set questions, in a stack of cards. On your turn, you read and answer a question based on the 3 tiles you see -- you are helping everyone else. On others' turns, you get some information and try to deduce what your 3 tiles are. When you guess, you get 1 pt if correct. Right or wrong, your tiles are discarded and you get 3 new ones. Once there are 7 tiles left in the draw pile, all tiles are shuffled together.

This is an interesting game, but we had problems with our note taking. It's especially difficult after the discards are shuffled into the draw stack because if another black 3 shows up (for example), you don't know if it's the one you'd already crossed off your suspects. We ended the game prematurely because a few slip-ups gave the answers away. I would surely have lost, though, because of 2 incorrect guesses I'd made earlier.

Would try it again, but it's not as straightforward and quick as Black Vienna. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Surprisingly fun deduction game that's easy to learn yet is amongst the heavier games of this type.  Not quite as complex as Sleuth, in large part because you don't have to choose which question and which opponent to ask.  It plays quickly for such a deep thinking game.  In both games I felt as if I was one or two questions away from breaking the code.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game is essentially a competitive puzzle.  Each player has a rack of 3 numbered/colored tiles and can only see other player's racks.  Each turn a player pulls a card from a deck that will ask questions about the tiles that player can see, such as "how many blue 3s do you see".  With the answers given by other players to these questions you're supposed to be able to slowly deduce which numbers you have in your rack.

When I played it I have to admit I wanted to keep playing it but at the same time I don't think this is something I want to play too terribly often, especially not at game night.  The reason I wanted to keep playing it is I enjoy puzzles and brain exercises.  I was legitimately having fun challenging myself to figure out my tiles before everyone else.  But that doesn't make this a good GAME.  I have puzzles I can do on my own but when I get together to play board games I want to play games that actually feel like games.

While it wasn't terribly noticeable in my few plays of the game it is also pretty apparent that one of the major flaws of the game could be lucky and unlucky setups and question draws.  Certain setups and question combinations can give someone a major treasure trove of information while others can be completely unhelpful and really it's all luck of the draw which category you fall into.

You're also very dependent on a player not making mistakes, in at least one of our games a player answered a question incorrectly (by mistake) which completely sabotaged myself and another player.  And not seeing your own tiles makes it impossible usually to catch a person in their mistake.

Another player summarized it aptly, "like Bingo, but less fun."  There is a deduction element, but if everyone is reasonably sharp, it comes down to an awful lot of luck -- what question cards are drawn and what number tiles you get.

[DIY] {Abstract; logic-deduction; optimal 4p} {basic 5; variation 5} Code 777 is a solid logic-deduction game for family - quite fun, suitable game length and applicable induction logic. There are no tactical decisions in the game - you can only rely on the card draw to gain information about your hand. Sometimes, players have to wait for a useful question to solve the puzzle. Player interaction is low; it's not as strong as Coda.  It is a very good multi-player entry deduction game (in addition to Clue and Coda). For gamers, Sleuth or Black Vienna are better choices because players have more controls.  I will use the challenging variation all the time.

It's OOP and the current price of the bid is unrealistically high.  I won't spend more than USD25 to buy this game, in case I have chance.

Hard and fun at the same time.

I'm not too fond of the components. The cards are a bit too stiff and the insert kind of locks the displays which makes them hard to get out, which annoys me a bit.

--------

tl;dr: such a fun challenge

I really like this kind of game. No nonsense, here's the premise, go. There is kind of a luck factor in what cards you get because some questions just don't help you. The timing of getting your new sets is also important. If you get to grab your third set just before all the old tiles are reshuffled, you're in a very good position to win. Very, very good. So in that regard some people could say there is a runaway leader problem, but that's not how it feels to me. It's all about the fun challenge of solving the question what code you have, not about who wins in the end!

Nice little brain burner of a deductive logic game. Players try to guess the cards they have, based on limited information provided by the other players when they answer questions about the cards they can see. Supports 2-4, but is probably best with more, rather than fewer people. My version is home-made using the color-blind card files, but I'm looking forward to picking up the Stronghold edition.

RATING: 7
I prefer the homemade copies my friends own. I find the 2010 Stronghold version much more difficult to work with. While the tiles are cool, the stands are small and don't help shield your notes. The black & white note pads are useless. Stronghold tried to add help for the color-blind by placing symbols behind the numbers. Unfortunately, this just makes the numbers harder to read. They made no changes to the card text which still reference color, not symbol - so essentially, the symbols are more a hindrance than a help. I highly recommend printing one of the color note pads available here on the Geek - it makes all the difference! I gave up when using the black & white note pad.

I'd rather play it first but I'm cautiously putting it on my wishlist to own even without playing it.

Nice deduction game.  Works well as a family game -- my 9 year old daughter became instantly obsessed with it.

I made my own copy with Artscow cards and my own cardholder design, and it works quite well.

Really good deduction game.  It's more of a race between solving small numbers, than solving the big "crime".  Just a touch of luck, and randomness in the order of the questions makes it easier for this to come out to the table.  Good times, recommended.

Code 777 is an old Jumbo game from 1986 that is getting harder to track down these days, which is why I took the opportunity to try it out at BGG.CON. I coerced the unsuspecting Brian and Lisa to try it out with me. It was certainly very different from anything else I played at BGG.CON, which made it a very nice change of pace and makes it tempting to hunt down a copy. It’s a deduction game where each player has a rack of 3 numbers that faces away from them so that everyone else can see it but you can’t see your own numbers. The goal of the game is to figure out what numbers are on your rack. Each turn a player answers a question on a randomly drawn card about the numbers they can see, such as whether they see more even or odd numbers. This allows players to slowly gather information about their own set of numbers and hopefully be the first person to announce that they’ve determined their numbers. It’s really a neat little deduction game that plays quickly and provides plenty of "lightbulb moments" where you make a breakthrough, but also plenty of head scratching moments where you learn a bit of information that contradicts everything you thought you knew.

Love this game.  Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure no one in my family or game group will play, as it's a deduction game.  :cry:

A little drier than I expected. There are few interesting decisions - on your turn, you're just counting up tiles to answer a question - besides that of when to make a guess and how to take notes. Still, it's been enjoyed by those who've played it.

Very easy to play, but very hard to master. Playing with someone not able to tell the difference between even and uneven numbers makes it even harder.

Well, I don't know do I like like this game or not. Maybe need few games more to find out.

I really like deduction games, and I would probably play Coda instead of Code 777. 

Code 777 is very easy to make. You only need some paper and some cardprotectors.

ok look.  i like mastermind.  i like mystery of the abbey.  so it stands to reason that i like some deduction games.  HOWEVER!!!  ugh i just can't put into words how much i dislike this game of "make me look like a complete fool"...  shame too becuase i like stronghold games.  i like the components (which is why this has a 3 rating instead of a 1).  this is the downside of commiting to rate every game i play because everyone else at the table had a good time when this was played.  i was the only one that hated it.  so my guess is its me and not the game.

Only works if everyone is on the same level of logic.  Clues can lead to solutions over several turns in strange ways, and timing becomes everything, because somebody else is always closer to solving their puzzle immediately after you solved yours.  You have to enjoy complex puzzle solving to have fun with this one. (I prefer the house rule of restarting completely whenever someone solves a puzzle.)

This is Sleuth-light for those with less time on their hands.  It has the added bonus of letting players feel successful even if they don't win (hopefully) because usually everyone can get one set guessed correctly before the winner guesses three.

RATING: 4
This manages to be a neat deduction game based on premise, but feels too narrow in execution. I'd prefer if I had my choice of the questions or had a better way to notate indirect evidence. The shrinking pool of possibilities helps alleviate guesswork, but getting the right question at the right time feels entirely too luck based.

Edit: After finding some errata to the game that I didn't even know existed (nullifying the ability to observe missed guesses), it became a whole different beast. Admittedly, the clarifications made sense (though I was pissed that errata changed what I viewed as a good game), but in a game where one of my gamer groups complained of it's difficulty BEFORE the changes, I despaired of ever getting it to the table again. It's a shame, because I think, with the right group, this could have been a keeper. Traded away.

The idea of being able to see everyone else's tiles but your own is genius, since each player gets different information from the same questions. My favorite deduction game.

I like deduction games and I enjoyed this one.  However, it doesn't lend itself to note-taking very well and that can be a big problem after a few correct guesses have been made.

Something about this simple deductive puzzle keeps us coming back. It's hard to go out of style when it's so classic. 
We're keeping this one for sure. I've even made special full color laminated play mats so we can us dry erase markers to record our notes and guesses.

It's worth noting that I played this with a number of house rules, perhaps the most important of which is that rather than drawing a single question card and being obligated to play it one draws two and picks one. There are also some other house rules that make a significant difference and improve the game.

I'm not good at deduction games, because while I can deduce based off of a direct connection on a single clue, it's more difficult for me to narrow down my choices based on indirect, multiple clues.  Plus, it seems to take much longer than I have patience for these sorts of games.  It has an interesting design, though.

This clever little game combines the elements of a good, logical deduction game and Indian poker. Each player receives a rack for keeping three tiles drawn from a pool of tiles, which are seven different numbers in seven different colors, however the rack is turned away from you. When players sit in a circle, each player can see everyone else's tiles, except their own. Each turn, players draw a card with a question like, "Do you see more yellow sevens or more blue sevens?" which should help the others' determine their tiles. Once you're reasonably sure, then you can take a guess. But if you're wrong, you have to start over with a fresh set of tiles...

Games start off OK, although the information you get is quite luck-based depending on which question cards come up. This part of the deduction is interesting. Once someone makes a guess, new information arrives and it sets off a chain of guesses from other players but the rules aren't specific enough on how to manage these guesses and from there it breaks down. When you get to reshuffling the discarded tiles, much of the information you've learnt is thrown out and you have to start again, which is frustrating. The game needs its FAQ to resolve some of its problems, but even that doesn't go far enough to save it. Sleuth is a much better deduction game.

The deduction aspect can be fun, but there's a lot of luck in what questions are drawn. There are very few decisions so it sometimes feels more like the game is playing you than the other way around.

I have only played 2 player. The cards need some adjusting to make sense for 2 players. But, a fun deduction challenge. As it is a race to get your answer first there is the interest of a logical problem and the tension of who gets there first.

A decent logic deduction game by trying to figure out your combination of numbers and colors from the questions the other players answer.  I think the first player to go and to guess correctly will always have a slight advantage, but it isn't unbalanced enough to cause too much problem.

Tentative rating:  I am not sure how I feel about this, but I really wish:
:colonist: The rules gave examples showing sensible ways to take notes.
:colonist: The component list cards showed the fives as red, rather than orange.
:colonist: The rules were twice as long and totally perspicuous.
:colonist: There were enough question cards for all the players, or note sheets that show what the questions are.

After 1 Play: Code 777 is to Zendo what Sudoku is to Crossword puzzles.  Sudoku is an interesting diversion, and there is a certain pleasure to be had in the exacting mathematical nature of it, but I will always prefer the more open form of crosswords.

Code 777 is a fun, if simple, logic game. You have 3 numbers from 1 to 7, and so does everyone else. You need to guess your numbers by asking questions and examining the other players’ numbers. I had fun, and I would likely enjoy playing more, but it’s another game that I would get bored of. There is no real interaction beside the automatic question and answer that you have. If you could ask your own questions, it would be more interesting.

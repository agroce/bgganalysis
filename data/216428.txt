RATING: 8
This is an easy to learn, beautiful little tile-placement game that scratches the right itch for me. Components are top quality, the artwork is fantastic and the game is easy to learn. But the strategy involved is intriguing because you must weigh the points you can score now by placing a tile against the points you can score at the end of the game by potentially placing that tile in another location. You must also consider whether placing a tile in a particular spot will aid or thwart your opponent. We had the most fun with three players but it also plays well as a two player or four player game.

We played with 4 players. Simple to learn, but strategic for experienced players. Beautiful game, would definitely reccomend!

Update: Have played with 2, 3, & 4 player combos. Loved all of them! This game is a fast, fun game. Great filler and easy to teach. Easy to play multiple times in a row.

I've played the game with Isaac, one of the designers.  I really enjoyed it, and thats not just because I won.
From turn two you will have the concept of the game. And from turn two you will already be pondering where the optimal placement will be, to gain you points as well as hindering your opponent.
It really is a game that you will feel you can pull out with any group or game night, just like Splendor

Fast-playing tile placement with dual-scoring conditions. Nice to look at but a little too light and breezy to crave more plays.

Neat set collection filler with nice chunky tiles. Has this really interesting mechanism in which players score points at the end of the game based on the angle you have to the board. Plays very fast and something the whole family would enjoy.

RATING: 6.5
Pretty game with very nice pieces.  Initial scoring of the birds (clusters/flocks) feels a bit like Ingenious with final scoring of the flowers (rows of like flowers) sort of reminiscent of Take it Easy.  Moves seem a bit obvious and luck of the tile draw can make or break the game.

Simple, beautiful and quick playing Japanese nature themed abstract where players take turns placing chips into a shared garden to score points. The chips have birds on them surrounded by flowers, and while birds score for you immediately, flowers score you big points at the end of the game so you need to balance your placement of both. The interesting part is the scoring, because each player scores for themselves on a matter of perspective in different directions across the board. So chip placement is critical and you need to balance placing chips that score for you against having those chips also count for your opponent. 

It's just the kind of abstract we like â€“ simple to learn and easy to play, with more than meets the eye at first glance. Also 'Japanese themed' and 'very pretty' always helps to bump games up in our estimation. :) The game is beautiful to look at, and the production quality is high - cute little wooden sakura shaped score markers, lovely chunky chips that have a nice feel to them, sturdy board, and the box with that reflective foil is very striking. Sloppy editing of the rulebook drops my score down a notch though, as there are incorrect placement/score/examples which will be sure to confuse a new player. In a small 4 page rulebook that's inexcusable.

That being said, it's a game that's brilliant in its simplicity and well worth keeping in our collection. Recommended for those looking for a simple, relaxing end of day game, a lovely introduction to abstract games, or a quick playing filler for 2-3 players. Also has a solo mode which sounds interesting but very brain burny!

"Overall, Seikatsu is great! I've had a lot of fun with it and it's a game I'll regularly recommend if we have a few people sitting around and we're looking for a short-but-not-filler game. The board is nice, the pieces have a nice heft to them, and it's a quick, smart game. I'm a big fan of the box art -- the purple against the white is quite striking. The rest of the box I'm not as high on, mostly due to the size relative to the contents, but that's a thing that I generally get pretty testy about on both ends (though I'd argue a box that's too big is better than a box that's too small). That aside, it's an interesting game with a nice peaceful theme, and I'd totally recommend checking it out!"

This game has lovely artwork and nice solid pieces, scoring is simple and the rules are clear and straightforward. It is not a deep game but some thought and decision making is require making this a very nice game. My only gripe with this game is the box it comes in, it is yet another game which comes with 75% air, when we are trying to be ecology friendly the amount of waste in packaging I find irritating and slightly sad.

In the genre of "pleasant, pretty, undemanding games by Westerners on Japanese themes" this is better than Tokaido or Takenoko but not as good as Hanabi. It's also faster, smaller and less fussy than Kingdom Builder or Carcassonne in the genre of "make the obvious move, draw a tile, repeat".

To be fair it was taught totally wrong the first play and it was terrible. Knowing that we played again and it worked better. at the end of the day it didn't do anything for me and I didn't feel like I was making any fun choices. At least it is fast, but not a game I would return to.

Intrigued and probably will purchase this once available. 

I'm wondering if this might not play better as a strictly 2-player game on a 6x6 square grid using the same tile distribution. Opening tiles would be on diagonally opposite center spaces and the most you can score on a turn for birds would be 9 (all adjacent directions, including diagonally) instead of 7 on the hex board.

Played this 2 player.  We enjoyed the challenge and "puzzle" feel of it.  Liked that it wasn't just a quiet game where you each do your own puzzle, but that your pieces you put down effect each other.  We also liked that you score points in two ways, so there are two layers of thinking you have to go through when places your tokens.  Great components, beautiful art.  I do wish the box insert allowed for the bird tokens to stay in the bag during storage...that's my only gripe!  It could have been a much smaller box if it wasn't for the board.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.6
The asymmetry given by the along-the-rows scoring is interesting and naturally generates a means by which players can interfere with each others' plans. The theme isn't very strong at all, hence my categorization as an abstract; but it does inform the art direction, which has a very peaceful feel.

I liked this and ended up picking it up, with the intent of having a game option on hand for lighter game nights. It's easy to teach and looks nice; the plastic chips have a nice solidness. I've had success so far introducing it to people who would not be in for heavier games. (It helps that I'm bad enough at Seikatsu that players I dominate in medium-heavy Euros have all beaten me solidly.)

RATING: 9.5
Pros:  Beautiful.  Extremely easy to learn (minus bad example picture in rules), great with 2-4.  Nice pieces and board.  Perfect amount of play time.  A gentle visitor at tea time who may talk a bit of scandal and then leaves.  That's this game.

Cons:  None really, but quibbles.  First, are those flowers almost the same color?  Yes.  There is a minor rule description error that needs to be fixed in the example.  

What a great game!  Always will be in my collection.

Jan 2018:
Increasing to a 10.  This is one of the only (if not the only) games we own that we can sit down and play multiple times in a row.  Every time we finish a game we can't wait to start another.  Have now played at both 2p and 3p and it plays seamlessly with each.  My parents loved it after their first play and immediately requested to play it again, too!  (Luckily their own copy was already wrapped up under the tree for Christmas!)

Nov 2017:
Excellent light game.  2P is fast and competitive, but 3P will be even more challenging because you'll have to pay attention to all 3 directions on the board.  Rules are clean and easy to understand and it plays smoothly.  Almost feels like a step between Ingenious and Lanterns or Cacao.  The plays you make will earn you points immediately, but also set you up for end game points, too.

RATING: 8
+ Beautiful box art and great components
+ Great theme, something different (not fantasy/scifi)
+ Very easy to teach and learn
+ simple rules, clean design and short gameplay
+ enough choices to be interesting
+/- combining two different score mechanics, which first one is common and little boring (placing similar adjacent tiles to score) and the second one unique perspective lining-similar-tiles
+interesting choices between, which score system to invest and how to block point from your opponents at the same time
- Not sure what I think about Koi-tiles (Joker), which dont add much to game in my opinion

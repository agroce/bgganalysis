Great system.  This one doesn't have the star power of Devils or Eagles, but its good nonetheless. The French are tough.  Good place to start with GTS

Reading the old commentary on Panzer Command, I was struck by the people who commented that since units were sorted by regiment, rather than tactical units, it made coordination between (say) tanks and infantry unreasonably difficult. Strange to see that 25 years later, GTS still has this very strange artifact - "independent" units don't fight with the regiments they're actually assigned to, they activate separately, so when a French brigade activates and opens up on their attackers, that 75mm cannon that is assigned to the brigade, and positioned with units of the brigade, just sits there. Same with divisional armored assets for the Germans and Italians. It's very odd.
---
Soloed scenario 4 to get back into the system after a break. Was impressed by how boring and static it is. I really think this system is over-designed - too much work for a small number of decisions. Really, it's all about crossing open ground by suppressing the couple fire zones of long-range units, then trading low-odds shots. The large number of counters means it takes a while; the campaign game here is a mini-monster, not a reasonably playable game. I dunno. This is a system I have gone out of my way to try to understand and like, but at the end of the day it really creaks the 25+ years old game that it is, despite the nice modern graphics. I think I'm done.

I quite like the GTS system - not half as complex as I had feared. Components look great and a very interesting situation, although a bit static for the French. My Italians took a hammering and barely dented the walls.

A friend and I played the first two scenarios, the historical Italian tank charge and the What If scenario.  Still puzzling this one over.  Most of it seems to work well, but the +3 bonus for Fz to Fz op/fire seems excessive.

Update (July 2014) The game play is rather static for the French, and not particularly interesting.  This probably plays better as a solitaire game.  I still love the system and look forward to other titles using the system.

------------------
(2012) This game is much smaller and manageable than its big brothers The Devil's Cauldron and Where Eagles Dare. 
 
I found that the campaign game in TDC was a lot more fun to play than any of the scenarios.  I worried that the smaller scale of the scenarios was the reason why, and that consequently No Question of Surrender (which is no bigger than some of the scenarios of TDC) might also be mediocre.

But so far a friend and I have played a few days into the Campaign for No Question of Surrender and it is pretty good.  My rating of 8 is provisional, and could go up or down as we play further into the campaign.

System is not bad, probably except meelee which is too difficult. Problem with this one is taht we were not impressed  by scenarios and overall situation. There are some oddities like French have super modifiers in fortifications, but Italians and Germans do not get nothing. They should not get same modifiers, but it seems wrong that terain which is superfortress for one side behaves like clear terrain for other. and honestly we are not much into fight between French and Italians.

Initial rating... nice counters, map, and rule books. Should look very familiar if you have played TDC and WED. Very few Working +1/+2 chits... maybe it is hard to build IP with all the sand. Another difference is that the Division and Formation chits are not the big 1" squares like in TDC but it makes sens they are the same size as all the other counters from a print run perspective.

RATING: 7
The series sell on their maps, counters and art.  The rules are quite clean as far as I know.  This is a one map game and so if you do not have the table space like I do to play the other two monster GTS series games, this would be the perfect choice to enter into the system.

No Question of Surrender is a small member of the MMP Grand Tactical Series.  It plays fast and is a good introduction to the series.  It is best suited to solo play since the French mainly sit and shoot while the Axis struggles to deploy an attack force sufficiently strong to break the perimeter.

As usual in this series, the players are constrained by command and control limits.  In this case, dispatch points (for activating regimental-size units) are so unlikely to accumulate that most action occurs via direct command of individual companies via the more abundant command points.  Roughly 7 Axis and 9 French companies can act per turn.  The system and well-tuned C&C limits yield a good reproduction of the challenge of taking Bar Hacheim.  

The rules meet the usual Dean Essig high standard for clarity and repeating rules wherever you might think to look for them.  A much shorter rule-reminder pamphlet with no repetition is provided for quick look-ups during play.  It also has nice flow-charts for the moderately complex combat procedures.

The matte map and 5/8" pieces make for easy reading, although the unit labels on the artillery "in command" markers are way too small.  Player aids are abundant, color coded, and printed on glossy card stock.  Nice.

Well, I got this as an entry drug into the GTS.  First, the other games are simply too large for comfort, second, it is a famous situation that has not really been addressed at this level.  Sadly, I find that the worst weakness of the old Panzer Command is still here: the chit activation does not support but prevents historical patterns of operation (at least for the Germans and likely for the French).  Since the formation chits are allocated to regiments, combined arms tactics for the Germans become impossible.  Let me rephrase this more clearly: This is worse than Igo-Yougo.  Instead of a insightful tactical study, this becomes a bizarre distortion of reality. With Panzer Command, I could forgive this, because it was a groundbreaking game in principle, but to see its biggest flaw mindlessly copied after 25 years is truly mindboggling.  In a "grand TACTICAL Series" I would have expected some support for historical tactics. Sigh.

Other than that, it's OK.

Well, now I've played 3 sessions and I'm ready to reduce it another notch.  The chitpull system has been changed strongly from Panzer Command and not for the better.  The divisional chits mean that now getting your own divisional chit before your direct command chit is the most important thing in the game.  The other is how often you can roll a 0 on a d10 so you get more dispatch points.  Since that won't be very often, the actual command system is pretty much sidestepped and you mostly play with Direct Commands.  A real step down.

I think it's THE GAME to learn GTS system. The game is very playable. The scenario 1 helps you to learn the system and scenario 2 and 3 are very interesting and tense with a lot of tactical choices. In this system, you must use your units in a very historical style to win the game. The scenarios are playable in an evening. For me, the system is fantastic and very addictive. I want more games in this serie.
I can't wait the next game about D-Day.

Great intro to the GTS system.  No issues with the system, rules, or components.  I'm just not sure how replayable this is.  While the French have to move around a bit, for the most part they are static with some minimal decisions to make.  For the Axis it's all about setting up a set piece assault on a portion of the line and hoping your formations don't leave the battle when taking losses.  If you can manage to avoid that, and get into assaults, the French will fold quickly.

I will play again, use this to teach others the system, but since I have the space, I'd set up WED or TDC if I really wanted to get into the GTS mood.

Great fun in a small package.  

The GTS game system really shines in smaller engagements like those presented here in NQoS.  Great components,  balanced scenarios (yes the Italians can even win scenario #1) and proves a nail-biter at every turn. The closeness of this battlefield combined with the lack of blocking terrain also allows players extensive practice implimenting the subtle but crucial tactics which this system is built around.

Simply a great game and a great addition to the GTS system.  I look forward to seeing more smaller games like this in the series.

Not very impressive after two plays. Too similar to Panzerblitz. It's early to rate it, though. Makes me wonder why did I like Devil's Cauldron system in the first place.

The unreadable mapboard detracts from the game, even if there are not many terrain effects involved.

When, mine arrived from CSI I  found it was missing the game map.  Kind of hard to play without the map.  Contacted MMP 12/9/14 told them my situation and they said they would ship me out the map.  Still a little worried, they said they couldn't see my e-mail I sent the night before concering the mattter.  Everything else in the game looks great, but I will not really know until I get the game map.  Update got the map about a week later thanks MMP!

A nice introduction to the Grand Tactical series thanks to its reduced price and size when compared with its big brothers. The nature of the engagement (a French defence of a fortress in North Afrika) means that things are quite static for one side, making this game fairly suitable for solitaire play (the only way I have played it). 

Love the counter artwork and, even though deserts aren't the most interesting things to view from the air, the map art is decent too. I thought the resolution of the printing on the map could have been a bit higher. I would have paid significantly more to get a mounted map board, but that doesn't seem to be a thing these days.

Some have complained about the chatty style of the rule book. As a relative newcomer to wargames, I found this to me more accessible than something like the rules from the ASL  starter kit. An index would have been nice to facilitate referencing forgotten rules, though.

A very light "dudes on a map"-type game that features some pretty fun mechanics.  Gives players a bit to think about each turn, but ultimately, I would much rather bust out Heroscape over this.  Both games play in about the same time frame (Heroscape might be a bit longer), but the theme is executed better in Heroscape and the variable scenarios and battlefield set ups gives it way more replayability.  Final word, this game isn't bad, but there's just something out there which is already better.

Yes. The game looks cool. The art on the tiles is certainly unique. And the theme is original. Mongols conquering what appears to be a Roman city. Even the exploration of the tiles to conquer them is very cool. However, when it is all said and done, the game comes down to rolling dice. You can try to mitigate that by sending in more troops but even then you can still be beaten by the dice rolling. Now were the combat in this deterministic combined with card play that might work. But the randomness of the dice just ruin the game in our opinion.

We had just played a game of Yspahan, one of my favorites, a game with a healthy dose of dice luck mitigated by the fact that even if the dice don't do what you want them to do there's almost always something to do that advances your position, even if just a little bit. I like plenty of trick-taking card games, which have a lot of luck in what cards you're dealt, which is mitigated by skill in that there's almost always a way to make hay out of your hand (and the fact that even when you can't it's fun to try).

And then there's Battue, a game with an amazing amount of luck, which is mitigated by pretty much nothing at all. I was keeping up, maybe not doing so well as the player who drew a small storm of end-of-turn loot cards but pretty decently, when an event halved the size of my horde before a fight, making the attacker card I had useless. I (perhaps unwisely) tried the fight again after losing the first sally by one, and then retreated my horde of two to safety. I spent the next four turns reinforcing my horde by one horse each time while everyone else was busily finishing up the game, and oh, someone stole my one loot card and I lost another two units due to other people's events.

So, yeah. I don't mind luck in games, but you won't catch me playing Battue again.

In my first play of this with John, I ended up with a 36 vp to 35 vp win in a 2-player game. I continue to believe that the luck factor caused by the Loot cards is too high.

Having played in a 4-player game, the luck factor is diminished a little bit. Definitely best as a 4-player game.

Normally I don't care for luck in games, but this one has way to much luck elements. The dice, the cards, the tiles - everything is swinging between total defeat and total victory A LOT. Each event card can totally change the game and screw up your current tactic.
What's even worse: If you are lucky you get a lot of cards to change the outcome of dice rolls in the future. If you are unlucky... well you get nothing - must of your turns will be very short because you can't do anything.
On the plus side: The game has nice components, a very nice background idea and it plays short (< 60 minutes).

I was fortunate to pick up both a lesson and a copy of this game at Tn Game Days! I like the game, no it is not the deepest strategy game out there, but it is fun, it sets up beautifully and has enough to "do" that it ends up setting up the players to want a deeper experience. That this game can deliver that is a good thing, that it always does not, could be construed as a negative, I however look at it positively, and at the end I have had fun on my time with it and look forward to pulling it out soon. The Beautiful components are a plus in that they drew my wife in on looks alone, and the game play was in offensive to her so she learned it and we will dig into it proper soon. I think its a fun light game that has potential for more and a good foundation on which to build it.

05/07/2010 - Rating creeps up a bit, really liking this game more and more.

RATING: 5
Odd little game, in which players lay face-down tiles to cover a board, and then conquer these tiles with their army.  Your strategy is mixed between splitting up your armies, reinforcing, and conquering.  Combat and loot cards add additional variety.  A lot depends on the luck of the dice, to the point that we had one player eliminated turn one. (We quickly "house ruled" him back into the game)

The playing pieces look fantastic, and the game plays reasonably quickly for a game of this weight, and with this amount of luck.  You really get punished for not picking your battles, and for pressing on too far.

One player will be handicapped with three, so strongly advised to play four.   Each of the mechanics underwhelms, but somehow ends up as more than the sum of its parts.  I had fun and would play again.

RATING: 2.5
Entirely too random and chaotic.  You just rush into random locations (tetris-shaped map tiles) that have random defense values, and roll dice to see if you win.  If you win, you MIGHT get some loot cards... but they are also random.  So if you're lucky, you might get some loot cards worth victory point, but probably you will get crappy attack/defense cards.  Also, the components stink... the plastic horsemen and flags are quite ugly... and the finish on the map tiles is a shiny laminant that peels and tears easily (revealing bright white cardboard) just by punching out the pieces.

Some say this game is like Risk, but I think it is better.  Do Not Play this game with only 2 people - it is far to easy to win, as each player rushes to the center - the first person to get there is essentially the winner.

This game really requires all four players, as it forces you to encounter your opponent rather than it becoming a race.

This game does not get as much love as it deserves.  Of these types of dice-fest battlegames, Battue is clearly the cleanest and tightest of those.  The game plays quickly, and unlike Risk, there is a "race" to win, rather than using "stalling" tactics to build your army for one final push.  One of the better "big-army" dice-fest battle games out there.

So, you turn over a tile at random, to reveal a random defending force, which you roll a die against to see if you defeat it, and then draw a random treasure.

Could this please be a little bit more random?  I'm worried about this becoming too predictable and forumulaic.

OK as light diversion; doesn't seem deeper strategically than "grab all the loot cards you can the first time through the deck".

I really enjoy Risk, but sometimes it can feel like a game of numbers. "My 28 armies attack your 8 armies here. My 28 attack your 6. My 27 attack your 5..." Or, "I turn in 3 cards and get 25 reinforcements, plus I own 2 continents so I get another 5 reinforcements..." Battue is not a game of numbers. It really feels thematic, with you leading a rampaging, pillaging horde of barbaric horsemen into a city to loot and destroy. The hidden (and changing) game board means you never know what situation you're about to ride into, and the event cards introduce something of a storyline to the game. Loot cards give you the ability to affect the outcome of battles, so it's not always about the dice roll. (Some loot cards allow you to dispense with the dice roll altogether.) All this and it sets up in less time than Risk and plays in about an hour. I wish the quality of the components were better - some of the cardboard tiles are warped and others are torn on the back, marking them (in a hidden tile game, this isn't a good thing). While it was in business, the company seemed to be good at addressing this issue and sending out replacements, but alas, they are now out of business, so you are stuck with what you get. Luckily for me, the torn pieces aren't all that important, and you can play without them since you are given more tiles than you need to play.

RATING: 6.6
The board changes with every game.  The cards are self-explanatory--no looking up in the rule book.  Play is quick. Board is beautiful, components well done. After playing this game for the 3rd time, I have I to downgrade my rating because of one problem that has occurred every game.  Each time I have played with 4 people; each time one of us is defeated by the gate; each time that person has been unable to recover & is essentially eliminated from the game from the first round, not even being able to be a hindrance.  This hurts the game so severly that for me it reduces the game from my origianl rating of 8 to a 6.3, and I have removed it from my "To Purchase" list.  (However, I have just made a math trade for the game & will get the expansion--have no idea, but maybe some improvements there.)

Obtained in my first successful math trade.

Really wanted to like this one ... we didn't take it seriously, we pounded our fists on the table and played our roles to the hilt ... but it is still a luck-fest driven by cards, dice, and tiles.

I like the idea of a quick and simple conquest game, but this is ridiculously random. Everything carries a ton of luck. First, you reveal city tiles with random defense values - after moving your armies onto them. Some tiles come with a random event that can be very beneficial or very harmful. Then, with each side using a single die for combat, there is just too much variance. Finally, if a player conquers a tile, he may get loot cards that vary immensely in usefulness or victory-point values.

The production isn't good, either. A few of the pre-punched tiles came already slightly marked. The miniatures are ugly, with very little detail. The small icons on the tiles are hard to read from a distance. And there should be a score track, since the scores are completely open but extremely annoying to check.

Despite all that, my first game was somewhat fun. The second, less so. After the third, even having added the expansion, I was done with the game.

Avery cool Amazon.com find. The components are good quality and I love the idea of flipping the tiles when you explore. Takes a little time to set up, but overall the game is a light risk-like battle game.  It has a little bit area control as you want to protect your high victory towns.  The cards are a bit unbalanced but no more the Clank series games. If you get a chance pick this up and the expansion as well.

RATING: 7
First played April 2nd, 2008. Taught in 10min, played 30-45min with 4 players. This is heavily luck based, however it's very fun. Tiles are placed face down on the board. Three of these tiles are special and indicate end of the game when players have conqured them. There are two decks, battle(good and bad things can happen, lose horse, lose cards, get VPs, etc) and loot(mostly good, VPs, get horse, change odds, etc) cards. Players start out with 6 riders in a horde, pick a side, and battle the wall to get in. After you are in, you can battle any adjacent Orthogonal tile. Limit one action(battle, reinforce) per turn. In a battle, the player to your left rolls for the defender tile after you resolve the battle card(if indicated). The tiles(and wall) have defense value(indicated on the card) which is added to the roll. Your die roll plus the riders in your horde count for you. If you tie or lose, you lose one rider. If you win, put a flag claim and take the shown number of loot cards. Most VPs wins. Recommended borrow and consideration of purchase.

I'm going to give this a seven. It is a fun, nonsensical, luck fest, but I won my first two games with some awesome luck (and possibly some cheating). My friend, however, hates it and thinks I should rate it very low. I think if you're on the receiving end of the good luck in this game then you will like it, but if not, you may hate it. I'm looking forward to playing with all four players.

It's a light war game that's very fiddly.  Removing the horsemen to flip over a tile only to place the horsemen back on the tile is a pain.  House rule: describe all movement first, flip any necessary tiles, and then move the figures.

I enjoy the game with my 10 and 12 year old boys.  Luck is a factor, but there are decisions to be made as well. The game moves quickly, which is an important factor for my boys, lest they lose interest.

RATING: 6.5
Game is relatively fun, though luck can seem to be a strong driving force of the game. But, I've noticed if one keeps ones armies tight, one can control luck greatly, but does run the risk of being outdone quickly by ones opponent.
The theme works but the card art is not the greatest. Also, some of the cards could use better wording for what they do.
The game is a light war game of sorts and can end pretty quickly, but some of the ups and downs make is exciting. I've only played it in two-player games and I have a feeling the game would be alot better in 3 players, as in two players the players don't get to interact with each other much.

This is risk, don't be fooled by the new skin, it's risk. if you like risk you'll like this game, if you hate risk then you might not like it, depends on why you don't like risk. Some people complain that risk takes to long and this game has solved that by not making it about eliminating the other players but scoring points by capturing portions of the city. It ends quicker because once certain parts of the city are conquered (it doesn't matter by whom) the game is over. Also you have more city tiles than you use in a game and each time you set up the board will be slightly different, which does help add some distinctiveness to this game. So yeah I like risk, I like this game.

I genuinely enjoy short, light combat games that involve a certain amount of luck.  This particular game though was sooo random and short that I cannot recommend it.  The pieces are quite nice and the city exploration mechanic is well handled but the event cards, tile flipping, combat die rolls, loot card draws etc. just make the game way too random for anyone to care about the outcome.

RATING: 6.2
Has some issues in that there is a small chance of player elimination on the first turn due to some strange events pulls. Luck is a big factor mitigated somewhat by some of the loot cards. It feels like there aren't quite enough loot cards as by midgame the entire deck has been sorted through and all the points cards are gone. 

The components in this game are great, the warrior pieces especially have a nice feel. Sending your hordes into the city to pillage is a lot of fun too. Despite its mechanical issues it's still an enjoyable experience.

english version 2008, Played with expansion- I won with 27 VP after 20 Minutes, opponent had 12 VP. We did not see what she could have done to avoid this outcome.
Great components (though half a dozen of the tiles in my copy are marked with creases and splits of the coating), short and easy to understand rules, very impressive setup. 
Much too luck dependant for my taste while having not enough theme to balance this downside. Could profit very much from some house rules like limiting the loot cards for one's own war chest to a single card per round. The rule book doesn't say anything about open or hidden play of cards, I think (the game would improve a bit by playing VP cards and combat cards face-down).
The three tiles marking the end of the game do give me a headache, too (too easy to reach them and finish the game if one can be sure to have the most VP.)

[b]If I had owned this game when I was a teen, I would clearly have rated this an 8 or higher (IMHO for the right target group, this will be fun).[/b]

A dicefest, but has surprisingly interesting choices, especially in the end game.  It is certainly true that if you draw good cards or roll exceptionally well that you can run away with the game - but I think this is not common.  You are limited to only a few "armies" on the board at once, and to win you must capture (and hold) certain areas in the city.  Thus, as the game progresses, you have to make some real choices about whether you will defend an important victory point tile or if you will be aggressive and either attack an opponent or an unrevealed city tile.  Good fun, plays fast, excellent components - a solid 7, but will probably drop with repeat plays as the luck component becomes a little more frustrating.

A light conflict game, lighter than Risk in some aspects, Battue sets its players the task of conquering sections of the fabled City of Brass Pillars.

There is a tonne of luck here, more than that found in Risk, but it is enjoyable enough with the discovery aspect of searching the city and the strategic nature of holding onto prime real estate in the city, including some that force the end game trigger.

For some reason though I found this to be rather uninspired and it let me rather flat.

RATING: 6
It's a roll-on-up, knock-'em-down dice fest of Risk-esque stature, except here it's a modular board fighting for VPs. It's a game designed for the teenage boys market, and for that it works just fine. Each group of soldiers either reinforces (randomly gets 1 to 3 units), or sets out to explore and conquer a new part of the board, which may have a random event, and will have a variable defense number. Add a d6 to the number of soldiers you have, the game adds a d6 to the defense value - if you don't win, lose a soldier and go again because it's a battle to the death, and if you do it's battle over, get the loot cards (which may be VPs, battle aids, or hit another player). The decisions each turn are when to be consolidate and when to venture forth hoping the odds and the dice gods are ever in your favour. The best strategy is to roll well. There's not a ton of cheer/groan factor to start with because you're competing against the board rather than other players. Direct conflict may come later, but then if you decide to beat up on one neighbour over the other, there's some significant kingmaking going on. So the game is not without its flaws. But at least it's over relatively quickly compared to others in this ilk, around the 60 min work, and you'll have had the fun of lots of dice work along the way.

RATING: N/A
I found the cards too unrelated to game play - you can get loot for 1VP or 4VP with the same random card draw, with no drawback or cost for the higher value card. Our last game saw two of the four players with all the Loot cards with any VP cards (Cache, Booty, etc.) and the other players with none - just based on luck of the draw. No matter how well or how poorly your actual play is, the cards you draw will determine who will win. I prefer games wherein the better play earns the more points.

A single dice roll determines combat and the hidden tile are very random. The tiles go from easy with a great benefit to near impossible at the start with a poor benefit. Worst of all the game promotes a run away leader.

I was intrigued by the nice components and board/city setup.  Unfortunately this game has lots of chrome but not much substance.   I played with 2 other adults.  We were quickly bored.  I think this would be a good kids game though.  

The Good:  Nice production value. The components were really well made. I also loved setting up the city board.  What a neat idea.  

The Bad:  There was little challenge in the game itself.  In a group of 3 players, we lost a total of 5 combats.  Something is way out of balance.  There was no need for strategy at all.  We saw the expansion advertisement on the box and wondered if the "expansion" was actually a "patch" to tighten up the game play.

Also, the flag minis need to be a different height than the warriors.  I tended to lose sight of flags on small squares with 8 warrior hordes.  The flags are also too tippy. The base needs to be wider or heavier.

The Ugly:  Some of the card photo art is just awful. The theme appears to be Mad Max meets Lone Ranger meets Troy. UGH!

Bit too random to be really good game, but rather nice theme and not too bad mechanics. Also plays fast enough. Some houserules to cut down the amount of luck in this game might make this one one of my favorites.

A multi-player conflict game with no reason to fight.  Lots of luck, snowballing, and kingmaking.  Luck and snowballing sort of cancel out, right?  And kingmaking and a slow tiring low interaction combat game balance things out, right?

The game is not all bad -- there are some choices about when to concentrate vs. spread out, and the troop cap prevents early luck from completely dominating the game.  But there is nothing clever or new here, just some old ideas that are a bit better implemented than they were in light games from the 80's.

The horse dudes are very nice quality and design.  The tiles are ugly and fairly cheap looking.  The rulebook is well written.

RATING: 5
Very nicely produced and attractive.  But the game had such wild randomness to it that I couldn't really enjoy it much.  My opponent seemed to turn over nothing but easy to conquer areas with great rewards while I turned up worthless or MUCH harder areas.  More players than the two we used might have provided some friction to slow his quick decimation of me, but that would have just added length.  Perhaps play with the tiles face up?  But honestly, when you can have a maximum of 8 guys in a horde and you add as much as 6 (a die roll) to come up with your combat score, there's just too much luck.  I wish these very nice guys better luck with their next game, which I think could use some blind playtesting with veteran gamers.

I think it is very annoying they sell the walls as an extra, and at a price equal to the original.

We had some fun playing it, allthough having to take the hordes off of tiles you have to turn over was a bit annoying, we'll use tokens next time.

Cards are very language dependent and there is too much of it so I'll have quite a job finding a good solution for that little problem. We easily lost oversight of the cards and it seemed easier to simply not bother with them. 

Not a bad game, allthough not having the walls does make you feel the game is incomplete...

We found the ending somewhat unsatisfactory. The game ends when three particular building have been taken.
In our game this meant a large part of the city still was undiscovered and we didn't really get to do a many fighting amongs players.

I think we may decide to chance that into some house rule, i.e. forgot about this and simply play on till all the tiles are turned over. 

One of the tiles is the palas which is not difficult to find, so maybe they expect the players to not touch the palace and end the game till later on?
Having said that, the palace is too many points to ignore.

The game play, not so great, in my opinion.  Because the tiles are hidden it rewards lucky play more than good play, it seems.  Also, if one player starts accumulating loot cards they can run away with the game.  I will probably try this again and hope it gets better.

The rules aren't particularly complicated: random tile setup (face down). Each player starts with a horde of 6. Enter the city by taking a wall, gate, or tower. Then move one space at a time attacking the tile (flip it up; resolve any event that might happen; fight against its defense) until the game ends (if everyone else is eliminated, or 3 key locations are captured). Fights are simple: roll a d6 and add #in your horde (tiles have intrinsic defense instead). Losing = lose 1 token; then, retreat or keep attacking. Winning gives you VP (place flag on the tile) and loot (cards which can be played for various effects or VP). When the game ends, whoever has the most VP (captured tiles and VP cards) wins!

This game SUCKS EGGS! It was kind of fun, but it's feels almost totally random -- lots of dice rolling, random events, random loot/VP! It's not likely I'll play this one more than once more....

RATING: 3
Light, highly random Ameritrash about invading Mongol hordes. There is a nice fog of war aspect where tiles representing buildings are turned up when a horde moves in; controlled buildings are worth points once the city finishes falling. Many buildings also trigger wildly variable events (ranging from positive to highly negative), and combat is resolved against the building itself or against other players if present. Combat is highly random and can involve, in addition to dice, yet more randomly drawn cards.

This was never going to be a game I would love, but I was hoping for something with more than its HeroQuest-level weight. It's just far too random and the theme isn't nearly interesting enough to sustain interest in it as a story/experience.

Ameritrash at it's best! Very luck-based, but that doesn't matter because the mechanics are so neat, the game itself looks very nice and the theme is awesome. I only wonder why they had to bother with the "fantasy" setting when it's so obviously based on the Mongol invasions, which IMO would have been an even better theme. Also, having an individual piece for each unit is a bit messy - for sheer playability, different sized/numbered counters would have been a better solution.

Great flavor and presentation, but all the dice rolling to determine outcome will prevent me from recommending it.

It is a fast and fun game. Played with the right players can be very entertaining. I like the mechanisms around the game. The components are very good but for some unexplained reason, the game comes with all its city tiles unpunched. Expect to have one or two tiles bended or otherwise damaged.

This was on my shelf of shame for a long time. Recently broke it out. The game is not bad, but it is fickle. The idea is better than the actual play. Can't take winning or losing too seriously because it depends on if you get lucky with tiles, roles and loot. HOWEVER...it is fun to play with my kids and even my 4 year old (almost 5) seems to be able to grasp the basics.

I don't know.  My only game, I marched right to the center with minimal conflict over key areas and quickly won the game.  I might like it more after playing a few more times, but I'm not sure that I care enough to give it any further tries.  I won't seek it out, but I wouldn't turn it down, either.

I really dislike the D6 mechanic-- I have horror stories about Risk-- but I wouldn't flat-out refuse to play this game as I would Risk...

Has potential from the mechanics, but the execution is terrible.  The theme is already enough to make one queasy -- sacking a city is an atrocity of war, and this game papers over it with a "Gain glory!" kind of VP mechanic.  Yes, I'm sure that when you find the defeated royal niece you will "display" her. Uh huh.

Mechanically, this is just an abstract dressed up with some Ameritrash combat and cardplay mechanics.  It's not especially interesting, but the cards are far too powerful, and lead to a rich-get-richer dynamic which is boring and predictable.  There's an ability to stop the leader by piling on, but the game has the potential to go on forever if that dynamic takes hold, as there's no clock to bring the game closer to a conclusion. 

My group agreed on a couple things after our one play of this.  The tetris-like setup at the beginning was the most fun, and we were never playing this again.

I have only played solo to learn the rules, but I like what I see!  Great components, and the odd Euro/Ameri-game feel is unique.

A light and easily understood game. The tiles give it a good replay value.

Interesting game.  Gives me the feeling of Risk without a dragged out time of the game.  Light war game but definitely worth playing.  It's great at 3 or 4 players and its great to bust out when I want that conflict feeling but don't want to spend the whole day playing a game.


I want to paint these minis

There's more going on than meets the eye.  It's not a deep strategy game by any means, more of a Euro meets Ameritrash kind of combination leaning way more on the Ameritrash side.  It plays fast and you need to keep an eye on the leader and balance keeping Loot cards for your plans versus playing them to prevent unoccupied tiles from being taken.  There is luck of the cards and dice rolling in combat but some of the luck can be mitigated by planning and properly supporting your horde attacks.  I like the fact that the board is built up differently every game extending replay value.

I really wanted to like this game.  It is quick and fun to play and beautifully crafted.  Unfortunately, the game is incredibly random.  More unfortunately, the dice based combat is not the problem.  The real problem is the incredibly varied event and loot cards layered on top of the variable buildings.  If you get lucky and get a good building with a bunch of loot cards, you could end up with 6-10 points on a single turn compared to 0 for someone who ends up with a crappy building.  While the randomness is not the end of the world since the game is short, there is not enough game here to merit repeat plays.

Fun little game, albeit with a high level of randomness. The luck of the draw in the loot and event cards can really turn the game around. With the battles one can pretty much play the odds.

There's a strong dose of luck in this, but its shortish play time and a few other aspects combine to make it decent fun for me. Far preferred to other luck-based classic American style games like Risk.

Very random.  I like the pieces, I like the exploration of the city as you sack it, I just think there's a bit too much randomness especially from the loot cards.  It's still a fun game, I'm just not sure I have much influence over the outcome. Needs a few more dice to smooth out the results.

RATING: 1
Battle game with abundant luck and few options. Attacks involve one die roll, and districts are face-down, so other than a few select territories placed at the start the defense value of what you'll be attacking is unknown until you commit. Players only get one type of unit (generic soldier with no abilities) and one attack pattern. Rewards for conquering territory vary between junk and awesome crap (distribution after victory is random), and the amount of loot gained from a successful battle isn't necessarily associated with the difficulty to acquire it. Player interaction is not mandatory and can easily not occur.

People who hate random games should avoid this like the plague.  However if you embrace chaos and enjoy the strong theme of hordes of Mongol like warriors sacking a town then check this title out.

Also this game isn't devoid of tactical considerations, I just want to emphasis how strong of a role luck plays.  Battue also isn't all that long so it certainly doesn't overstay its welcome.

Demoed at Origins 2008.  I liked the theme and had a good time playing.  There is something really satisfying about sacking a city with your horde of solders.  The game itself is fun, but is a touch too luck dependant to get further plays from me.

This was the perfect second game for my 3 y.o. He received it as a gift when he was around 2.5, and really began to take to it at around 2.9.  He played it daily for months. He still plays it on occasion now, at 3.5

My daughter loves this game! It was the first board game I taught her how to play and it has a lot of educational value.  It's also pretty darned cute.  I have to rate this on behalf of my daughter.  The fun factor when playing with your child is way up there.  She loves picking the fruit and arranging it in her little basket, she even offers to share her fruit with me.  Also it's a great way to get your child to understand that losing isn't the worst thing in the world.

Great game to teach 3-years olds to take turns, correlate dice results to allowed actions, and to learn to fear dice results ^_^')

The cooperative aspect avoids the usual problems with kids loosing.

The game does well what it sets out to do, and because of that becomes obsolete as soon as the kid matures a bit. Still, a great stepping stone compared to games such as (Rory's cubes), where it's impossible to have the toddlers following some form of structured activity with dice.

Apr 2011: This is a well made kids co-op game with quality bits and a nice looking board.  It is certainly more of a tactile game than anything else, but the 3-year-old really liked it.  We beat it with one puzzle piece to spare, so it looks like there's at least the possibility of losing.  

The entire strategy comes down to "take fruit from the tree with the most left when you have a choice", but even something this simple isn't obvious to a 3 year old.  Initial rating a 7, mostly for the quality of the components.

Can be played with very young children, but pretty boring for adults as you don't do much but roll the dice and do what it says.

Got this for my 3 year old for her birthday and she loved rolling the die and picking the correct colors. She even followed all of the rules right on the first try, which was great! I wish there was a little more challenge though as we must have really good luck. In our few plays we have never gotten more than 4 raven pieces out of the 9 to lose the game. I understand it's a kids game, but even that seems really easy.

My three year old absolutely loves this game.  Very interesting mechanic with a puzzle within a game.  The puzzle acts as a timer signalling the arrival of the raven.  The production quality is outstanding.  Making loud raven noises also enhances the experience (at least in my three year old's eyes).  What "Hi-Ho Cherry-O" should be!  Highly recommended!  Note there is another game, "Harvest Time", that is very similar though much, much, cheaper - substituting paper bits for the wooden ones of the HABA game.

As a kids' game, Orchard is perfect for the 3 year old audience for which it was intended. It's not going to keep adults entertained by any means but it's great for kids because they will feel some excitement - even if the only choices at all in the game are which fruit to take when a "wild" is rolled. Without the "wild" option, this would be an "activity" and not a "game".

Game play is fairly remedial with minimal thought involved.  Roll the die, take the item that it says.  The only time thought can come into play is if the basket is rolled and you get to take two fruits of your choice.  None the less, the pieces are amazing ... and the game is useful for remedial skills like color and turn-taking.  Plus it's cooperative which is nice.

RATING: 5
Rated as a children's game because it IS a children's game.

All in all, this game is a good intro to multiple basic game mechanics, though it's never been a 10 with my daughter.  I can't help but wonder if there is a lot of hype around this game because of the components.
Mechanics it touches:
-turn taking (what game doesn't??)
-dice rolling to match a command (color matching here)
-decision making (1 of 6 rolls offers the option to choose any two fruits of the player's choice)
-basic puzzle assembly (3x3 grid = 9 square sided pieces)
-cooperative play/therefore playing against the game (which makes solitary play accessible)
-2 possible outcomes for game end (due to the cooperative play factor)...not sure this is really its own mechanic, but the completion of the puzzle does end the game regardless off how much fruit has been taken by the players.
While this is quite boring for adults, you can hardly argue that it is a good starter for kids.  It will soon diminish for the wunderkind in your home.

Games can be easily shortened while hardly altering play: start with 5 fruits per tree and place two puzzle pieces per raven roll.  Obviously, it can also be made easier in that same set up by placing only 1 piece per raven roll.

A nice "game" for pre-gaming children, which is what it's rated for. I've never even seen a full-size copy in person (with its big, chunky bits), but I have played the travel version a friend game me. What I like about it is how the setup has the child putting together a 4-piece puzzle and the 'timer' for the crow has the child assembling a 9-piece puzzle, and how the basket result on the die allows the possibility for more optimal choices. It's a nice level of difficulty, then, for my 3-year-old.

My 3 year old's 2011 Birthday gift, and first board game. She's really catching one and loving it. She requests is daily now. We get one good game in before she moves on to something else, but she really enjoys playing it once daily

What really works for me is that we're competing against the Raven together, instead of against each other. 

for the first few games she was rooting for the raven to come out more than anything... I thought that was pretty cool.

Whatever the outcome, the suspense is fun right?

This is a game I can play with my 2 1/2 yr. old grandson. Favorite game of my 4 year old grandson. 

Orchard is a quality co-op game that is based on luck of the die. Strategy is limited to  not picking all of one kind of fruit, early, when the basket allows choice.  Despite the fact there is little substance to the game I like it because the components are easy to handle and attract the children to play; it is fast; everyone wins or loses together; and matching the puzzle pieces to the board is a good challenge for the youngest. 

My 4 year old grandson learned how to share with this game--when he got the basket, he chose one for himself, and gave the 2nd to another player. This was entirely his idea.

"Le Verger" fait aujourd'hui figure d'incontournable quand on aborde le sujet des jeux éducatifs. Avec cette création, HABA a fait son entrée en force dans les écoles maternelles de nos vertes contrées. Dommage qu'on ne retienne que celui-ci, tant la gamme regorge de petites perles que je considère bien plus intéressantes.

Notons d'abord un matériel irréprochable, très attractif, qui porte à la manipulation et à l'émerveillement des enfants et des plus grands (on rêverait parfois d'une telle qualité pour nos jeux à nous) : petits fruits, petits paniers, belles illustrations... Mais sous ce bel emballage, le contenu est plus mitigé. Bien spur, sur le plan de la pédagogie, "Le Verger" est très utile : il permet de travailler sur le langage, sur la vie collective (attendre son tour), est abordable pour les tout petits, et donne du sens à une activité de dénombrement et de reconnaissance des couleurs, tout en demandant de reconstituer un puzzle (un peu compliqué pour les plus jeunes).

La tension est là, les enfants se prennent au jeu et voient petit à petit la menace du puzzle terminé s'approcher. Mais cela est assez artificiel au fond. Le jeu se veut coopératif (les enfants ne s'affrontent pas), mais la coopération réelle n'existe pas. Au fond, le jeu se résume à des lancers de dés sans réel choix (sauf lorsqu'il s'agit de choisir deux fruits à retirer) ni grand intérêt. Petit à petit, et malgré la courte durée, un ennui s'installe et l'aspect ludique de la chose disparaît... mais les ventes, elles, continuent.

Great components, though you need to be careful that kids don't get too rough with the baskets.

The gameplay is fun enough that a parent can enjoy it with the kids and find teachable moments about colors and shapes... and the added part of the Raven puzzle offers another challenge for kids. However, this isn't a game "the whole family can enjoy" like Animal upon Animal or Magic Labyrinth. The end game can get tedious. Still, my three-year old was able to get into this in a big way, so for a game I can play with younger kids that doesn't bore one out of one's gourd, this gets high marks.

My 27 month old son absolutely loves this game, and while there isn't a great deal of "game" - the only real choice occurs with the selection of fruits on the basket roll - it has allowed him to learn about taking turns, rolling dice and losing in a way that probably wouldn't have happened otherwise. That said, it will probably be surpassed fairly quickly for something with a bit more meat, but currently we seem to be playing it A LOT!

That said we have always played the game with only a single fruit being picked on a basket roll (got it second hand missing instructions and just started playing that way) - thus our fail rate is pretty high.

Children game - Good as a first boardgame. It offers a small tactical element when the basket is rolled. Children have to discover that in order to win against the raven they should take the fruits where the most are left over. In my games the children didn't care whether the raven won or that it is intended as a cooperative game. They always looked who gathered the most fruits. So much for cooperation!

それぞれの果樹の実は１０なので、10の補数を教える教材としても良かった。
ゲームが終わった後、収穫した実を広げて見せあって、友達通しで話がはずむので非常に雰囲気が良くなります。どの実を収穫するかを相談することもあります。
値段が高いことが欠点です。また、些細な点ですが、カラスのイメージが西洋と日本では違うので、どうかな？とも思います。（この年頃の絵本として、「カラスのパンやさん」があり、カラスに悪者のイメージがないので）４才児なら１０点。

While I don't deny that for kids of the right age this is a really fun game for them.  However with most kids games (in my experience anyway) adults are usually playing with their own kids and for this game there isn't really anything in it for an adult other than enjoying their child enjoying themselves.  Feel that other kids games (such as Viva Topo) have something to keep both the kids and adults interested and will therefore get played more often.

RATING: 4
I really wanted to rate this game a '2' as it doesn't meet my definition of a "game" in that you make ZERO choices (Making it a group activity in my book like assembling a puzzle with someone else would be).  However, quite simply, its one of the first games our son was able to play at not even 3 years old.  So for the absolutely youngest of children I'd still recommend this Activity in a Game Box as it was useful in helping to teach turn taking, dice rolling, and other such very basic game mechanics (Which I suppose are what still makes it a game for the targeted age group).  The toy like components help "lure" your kid into hopefully learning to sit still for the first time as well to play a type of structured activity.  Another game that was hugely successful for us at 2 years old was Junior Pictolino and HABA's own Hopple-Popple.  HABA's Ear Tug and Kleiner Teddy are other good ones as well.  Our son definitely loved Orchard in the 2-5 year old range though again it's only their joy in it that is fun for us adults.

Well i didn't realise this was a cooperative game before I played it.
In the game we played we managed to beat the Raven pretty easy (only half of the pictures was made).

I'm not sure but my guess is that the people playing the game have an advantage over the game. The object is to collect all the fruit from the orchard before the picture of the raven is completed.

This is great with young kids.

Good design too, the game difficulty remains the same regardless of how many players you have.  My 2 1/2 year old played this with me right out of the box, with no problems.  She now knows how to roll a die and how to apply die roll results to pieces on a game board.

My 2 year old absolutely loves playing this game. He sometimes gets a little upset if he doesn't roll the color he wants, but hey, that happens to everyone. I am delighted to be playing games with my son.

Fun kids game if you're playing with children under 6 years old. Players take turns rolling the dice and collect all the fruit before rolling 9 "ravens". Pretty game, but zero strategy.

This game has absolutely beautiful pieces.  The play is a little simple for my 4 year olds but they love it and are more engaged than with other games.  I modified the puzzle board by drawing the outline of the puzzle so there is no confusion where to put the 9 pieces as they come up.

Fun for the smallest kids. Not much to do than roll the die and do what it tells you.
It will be interesting when (or if) my kids will see what to choose when they roll the "basket" and can take two fruit.

The first cooperative game you should ever play with kids, it's just perfect for that purpose. You then move them on to Pandemic, Shadows over Camelot and then Arkham Horror. Don't reverse the order because it's not going to work out well at all...

Cooperativo per bambini contro quel brutto corvaccio che vuole mangiarsi i frutti sugli alberi. Gioco di dadi che, per la sua semplicità, si lascia giocare volentieri dai bimbi. E' per molti il primo passo verso un mondo più ampio!

Rating is somewhat difficult: it is nicely done with the fruits and small baskets - perfect for small children who cannot stand yet to lose on their own. Mechanics or general idea is similar to "Maskenball der Käfer", but I prefer that one, because it includes memory also, not only pure dice throwing luck.

I had very high expectations about this, cause it is in every list of children games.  Nevertheless, I found it a bit silly, because there are no decisions to make, just do whatever the die tell you to do.  Apart of learning colors and teach to take turns and to hate ravens, it seems to me that the game underestimate children capacities.  By the way, the bird looks more like a [i]zanate[/i] ([i]quiscalus nicaraguensis[/i]) than like a raven.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
this is not a game you play with big time gamers. this is a game you play with you 2 to 3 year old. This is a good teaching game. It has helped him figure out color, how to take turns, who is going to be next, to only pick up one item, and many others things. This game is also about sharing the win, we all work together to beat the crow. A game is a hit when some one asks to play more than once. he has asked many times to play this game.

This game is the perfect game for kids aged 2-4. It is cooperative, they can play it by themselves, they need to count, puzzle, roll the die, learn about turn order, special rules and colors. the quality of the components is superb and even when the kids have outgrown the game, the pieces can still be used for their toy grociers store. If you have small children you need to have this game, period.

This one is great for kids and hits "blind spot" 3-4 year old kids who are old enough to be introduced to board games but can only handle "so much" in terms of rules and skills required.

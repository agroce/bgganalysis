Fairly light game, seems like the main strategies are actually very simple, but optimising the layout of your islands is the key to the game.  Seems like the bonus tiles (which we didn't use) would significantly increase the game weight.

I have  soft spot in my heart for vikings, yet had yet to find a viking themed game that I really love. Then I met this game, adequately named "Vikings". It's worker placement, and tile laying, and solitaire packaged in a point generating versus game - but I like it. It's simple and elegant and comes with an additional expansion you can add in when the vanilla game gets stale. For me, this is one I love to play every year.

How come viking games never seem that vikingish (Fire and Axe excluded)? Even still, this is an enjoyable game that I would like to keep playing. The bidding system for tiles is very interesting, and the various paths to victory are enjoyable, even if they aren't incredibly taxing. The game plays quickly too, which is just right for the level of effort. Pretty good!

Vikings is a lighter game with limited player interaction.  That's not to say it's not there: you are looking at your opponents' board to see if they'll take what you want, or likewise so you might take what they need.  You need to decide *when* to pull the trigger on that tasty tile up ahead, weighing it's cost vs the risk of losing it entirely.

Aside from that, Vikings is largely an efficiency game of building your own board with the tiles present this round.  You look forward to see which ships are out that might knock your pieces down, try to obtain the ones you want, and generally just try to play well.

This game fits into my collection as a title with limited, non-aggressive player interaction that's light and fairly short.  It's fairly peaceful, but you still need to mind your opponents so it's definitely not multiplayer solitaire.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Accessible, attractive, with deep decision-making, but easy-to-pick-up rules, I can see why BGG users are clamouring to get hold of this out-of-print tile-laying classic. Everything is so streamlined and intuitive, you might expect the game to be a breeze. But there's a real challenge here, and it's an enjoyable one.

A very solid game. Plays in an hour packed full of meaningful decisions. Just does not have that extra something you could call a soul, to justify a higher rating. But if you like tile laying, rondel mechanics and denying other players their most wanted action Vikings is for you.

Vikings is maybe the best lightweight game with a twist. It's easy to setup, easy to explain, fast playing and has a high replay value. Also it scales very well. It has a good mix of strategy and tactics. It's a good gateway game for new gamers and also a great filler for veterans.

Vikings also has an advanced mode (called The Progress Version) that ads more depth to the game. We always play this variant, because it gives you more strategic choices.

Bought from Shire games, October 2009. Brilliant Euro game, well worth the time. Every game will be slightly different as tiles and Vikings come off the decks or out of the bag differently each time, and some are not used in each game leading to more variation. I prefer this to Fire and Axe and THAT`S a good game too. Anyone looking for bloody warfare steer clear - this is an exploration game really.

Good euro game, the theme sure exists, but is not the most relevant to the mechanics, like almost every euro. The rules are simple and clear, without missinterpretations. The theme, even not fully explored, is very interesting and make sense in some aspects, exploring, colonizing islands with workers.

Viking themed game. Build islands and fill them with various people and depending on the talents of the people score points. Beware of the viking boats unless you have a warrior to protect you. Simple game without a great deal of tactics and sometimes control, but it works and is fun.

The tile drafting and scoring is genuinely interesting. But the actual execution of gameplay actions is kind of meh.

Scoring is a bit more convoluted than a game of his weight level should have.

The progress version really ramps it up. Having boatsmen only move a single viking really is better and the special tiles are all pretty interesting in their own right and really motivate players to spend up a little bit. I'm not sure I want the hassle of an auction variant, but everything else is good.

It's fast, with an interesting and meaningful spatial element and interesting decisions as far as how far to go for your chosen pairing. Interesting that a big money and a tight money strategy are both viable (though you have to be really creative and accommodating if you play with little money).

Money is very useful, but I've found that nobles can really be a big factor. Just a really, really solid game.

There is really just one thing going on here; buying tile/meeple combos to build sets.  The price wheel adds a little interest in that you need to take care that your purchase doesn't set an opponent up with a bargain.  The Viking theme is barely there in the form of long boat tiles that need to be defended against.

Vikings is colourful, it plays quickly (for once the 60 minutes on the box seems an overestimate), I'd play it again, but it left no lasting impression with me.

The concept is good but the game play is very hit and miss. There seems to be a sizeable luck element in the draw of tiles (in 2 player) and not being able to take any zero cost tiles unless it's the last of its kind can screw you completely. 4 player plays totally different, money is much more at a premium.

Fun and quick game.  I like the viking wheel, I like that everyone is building up their own set of islands.  The scoring can be confusing, but the reference cards make it easier.

This game is mixed bag.  The individual mechanics are good, but the combination can result in a strange mix that can leave you wondering if the game works or is broken.  The first several plays I had felt very luck based and more than a bit chaotic.  After several plays I have resigned myself to think of the game as pretty good.  This makes the entry for the game a bit tough, but if you get past it, you might find a good game inside.

RATING: 8.4
Elegant design by Michael Kiesling, you place tiles on a mainland grid which you've bought from a wheel-shaped offer area, and each round begets a particular type of scoring. The placement of tiles is imperative to scoring and warding off the threats from Viking ships, which are also a way to score Fame and gold. In fact, the scoring of this games is one of its strengths, and made even better with the special tiles used in the advanced game, which I would not play without because they add just the right level of depth to take it beyond a gateway. However, the auction variant can slow the game down significantly, despite the strategies it adds. I think it can be left out without losing much of the feel, unless you want a longer session.

My most played game for 2008, and I only started playing in May.
I seem to keep getting hosed on the fishermen at the end but am usually able to deal with the issues of needing to defend against ships and requiring goldsmiths to bring in money.
Since getting myself a copy I'm going to have to figure out how to introduce my other gaming friends to it.

A rather good bidding game (even if the bidding part is not that apparent). It's got a nice amount of tension, and it plays fast.

UPDATE: After a few plays at yucata.de, I've come to the conclusion that I really enjoy this game, and it will probably become part of my wishlist quite soon.

UPDATE: I'm beginning to get a bit tired of this one. It's a great design, and the price wheel is just brilliant. But on the downside, it feels just like most drafting games... you can either be lucky enough that other players don't need what you need, or unlucky enough to get everything you could possibly use strip away from you.

It's a better 2-player game than it is 3 or 4 player, as this gets mitigated, though. For 2 players, I still rate it an 8... but as I usually game with more people, I must downgrade it's rating to a 7.

Well, the theme is thin... but the game is enjoyable! It's essentially a set collection game, with some elements of tile placement, and an unusual "wheel-driven" cost setting mechanic. It's light and fun, even for two players. And the variant seems to warrant enough replayability.

it seemed interesting, but somehow I felt all the decisions on what I can do are taken by others at the table. most of the time it's "how much am I willing to hurt myself just so I don't help someone else". perhaps if turn order didn't go around the table but was more varied it'd be more to my liking

This is probably my go to game when I am looking for a 60 minute game for four players.  It is difficult to explain, but everything about this game just works.  The auction mechanism is excellent -- it makes for hard decisions and yet the auction doesn't drag on forever.  The tile placement is simple yet elegant.  Generally, the most efficient player with the auction and tile laying will win.  I enjoy this game both with and without the bonus scoring tiles.

Ahh...the joys of the bidding wheel.  Such a simple mechanic, yet normally easy decisions are made complex by having to decide how best to utilize your gold, create or complete your islands, and how best to protect them from marauding vikings.  A game I can play with my 1st grade son, but with layers of decisions that intrigue my gaming peers, making them want to try different strategies in future gaming outings.  Plus, it's a game that doesn't take all night.  Accessible enough that I've played with men, women, and children.  A christmas gift from my boys. [Gift]

First play and initial impressions were good; rules were quick to learn, the mechanic is original, there appeared to be depth and the opportunity for various strategies. But as the game progressed the significant randomness of the tile draw and figure allocation soon revealed this to be a game with a significant reliance on blind luck. Draw the islands that face the 'wrong way' and future turns are utterly scuppered through no fault of your own, just because the next few turns don't throw up compatible shapes. Often my turn had only one option owing to the island tile configuration. Meanwhile your opponant can't believe their luck being swamped with choice.

In my game the winner had confessed to having no idea what he was doing during the 6 rounds but ended up with navigators by default. The last turn the tile draw fell in his lap and he walked it.

I had a feeling of helplessness throughout, playing the optimum from what was available but feeling that the game was dictating what I should do rather than having any scope for me shaping my strategy. No wish to play again.

Great medium weight euro that plays under 1h. Compared to palace of carara this game is easier to get into. But have the same depth. I prefer palace though. But having both is not a bad thing since this is easier to teach and work as a gateway game to euros.  

I am happy with my 2nd edition. All the tiles was punched out easy, the insert was perfect. The meeples of great quality. A linnen bag was added to draw the meeples from. Fantasy flight tarot size sleeves could be added to the player aids for scoring (those area great by the way).

I really like the clever mechanism for purchasing tiles and vikings.  With 3 players, the game seems to be balanced very well and there appear to be multiple paths to victory.  I've played this with 2 players now and it was highly successful.  Certainly better with three, but there were plenty of tough decisions throughout the game.  My wife and I both like this game.  After four 2 player games, I realize that this is a really good 2 player game with the "progress tiles."

After several plays with 2 players, I am feeling like this is one of the best (if not the best) 2 player games I have.

Gaming for game sake mechanics that have nothing to do with vikings in anyway, but not an abstract game. This is a common trait for Euros, and is starting to leave a bad taste for me.

I liked this. Some tough decisions with little room for error and the prospect of building your own area, ostensibly free from interruption, but actually subject to the screwage of somebody taking a tile or meeple you really need. You have to do some real planning to leave yourself enough flexibility to deal with whatever comes your way.

I don’t like Vikings, either historical or fantasized, but disliking Vikings (the boardgame, I mean) isn’t a matter of personal tastes, as the Norse theme is all but superficial here, like any self-respecting eurogame would be proud of: Vikings (again, the boardgame) is plain and simple boring.

RATING: 7.75
This feel of this game reminds me of something else, but I can't quite put my finger on what. After only one game, I can see that every game would be very different because of the tiles and vikings that come up each round. However, I wonder if the randomness of it would become tiring after many plays. You can't really stick to a long-term strategy because you don't know what tiles/vikings will be available. It's definitely more tactical in that way. There are lots of decisions to make, though, trying to figure out what the best move is for you, whether it's worth the amount that you'd have to pay for it now or if it's worth taking the chance that the same stuff will be available and cheaper on your next turn, whether it's better to take something that would help one of your opponents more--stuff like that. I definitely want to play it again.

UPDATE: It scales well from 2-4, but they feel quite different. With two players you get stuck with half the boats that come out, so it's a real struggle to get the placements right so that you get all your points and money.

RATING: 9
Hits the sweet spot of a gamer-ish game, playable in less than 1 hr., and no auctions (we play bonus tiles, but no auctions) no majorities, no set collection and no blind bidding. Great. Along with Yspahan and Notre Dame this genre has been on a roll lately for me.

Great quick game with a lot going on in a short amount of time.  Every turn you have a lot to think about.  Doesn't overstay it's welcome.  I think it could go up after playing it more.

Well, this never made it back to the table.  Ultimately I moved it for two games that I have played and enjoyed more.  

It's not bad and I would enjoy it if I played again but it did not hit that certain something for me to push it into the rotation.

It's a nice game but I don't see the need of purchasing a copy, there are a lot of games I prefer. I think it's better with 4 players but in yucata is too long and I never tried. 

Some people compared Vikings to Saint Petersburg. I don't see much of that since for me Saint Petersburg is one of my favourite games and Vikings only seems to be an average one.

The wheel is great. The game is nice, and I like it more every time I play it. The tile you really need is usually unavailable to you, making the game quite tense, since you're usually forced to choose between sub-optimal paths.

Without the auction, it feels a little better with 3 players than with four (since it's 6 rounds, with 3 players each one goes twice, instead of only half of the table doing so.)

[traded it away after playing it almost 20 times. It's a fun game, but I feel no real need to own it, specially after figuring out almost everything there is to figure out about the strategies]

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Initial rating after 2 consecutive 2p games (basic version online at BSW).  Seems like a pretty good abstract with room to manipulate other players... but sometimes it's most important to avoid hurting yourself with "bad" plays (like having no place to play a "middle" island piece).  Luck of the draw could be significant sometimes, but there are enough ways to mitigate luck if you get creative and stay flexible... plus the game plays pretty quickly so the luck doesn't bother me.

** UPDATE: With >2 players, this game is very different.  I got crushed in a 3p game because the game moves along much faster, and you get fewer tiles.  Also, I probably spent too much gold in the early rounds... I think money is supposed to be very tight such that buying something more than 5 gold is extravagant.  It's still an intriguing game right now, but the rating could fall if additional 3-4p games fail to impress me.

(3 VERSIONS EXIST- basic, advanced & BSW).  BSW has only the basic version with a slight modification that all tiles get shifted to the lowest position when the zero tile is taken (compared to the pricing wheel of the "real", printed board game).  The advanced or "progress" game has an auction for start player each round (and a slightly weird setup of tiles & vikings)... but it also has 25 bonus tiles that players obtain by buying the highest value set at a given moment (except the last tile/viking... the one taken for zero).  The bonus tiles are scoring bonus only... not additional land tiles... but they give you more to think about and maybe balance out some luck that can lead to big 7 & 10 point swings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.6
Slick game once you get to start playing it. We played it in 45 minutes, but probably overcooked the rules explanation upfront and that took 15 minutes or so! I really like the rotary mechanism for the money where you have to buy a tile/viking if there is more than one available, rather than taking 1 for free. If there's nothing left to buy, then the dial turns round to set the next available tile to zero value. This is easier to see than to explain, it's a really novel mechanic I've not seen before and it makes the games strategic calculations interesting.

I really enjoyed this game after 1 play. I had pretty much 3 of every role at the end, only 2 ships to threaten me and I won by about 20 points. This game worked out well for me but I would have been keen to play this again, regardless of the result.

I've since played this again with more in depth rules, which I didn't really understand beforehand, but the facts are that this is still a good game and the fact that there are a number of levels of complexity mean that you can grow in to the game as long as everyones reading from the same page!

I've played this game a few more times now and reckon that I understand all the rules, It's a great game!

RATING: 8
I bought this because it was relatively new on BSW and I thought it had some cool ideas.  The purchase system is a great mechanic, and the idea of each purchase providing two pieces of your VP puzzle is really cool.  Purchases can range from 2 GOOD pieces to 2 BAD pieces but most of them are a mix of OK and no-so-bad...  I definitely should get this game out more.  The more I play, the more I recognize that this game really rewards GOOD play... but it is still a little hard for me to describe to new players what GOOD play is...

What does this game have in common with Vikings, except of the name? Nothing, no theme, no game feeling. Interaction is reduced on buy away figures and/or tiles. Otherwise the play limits itself to your display and you are lost in thought and mess about it. At least the game flow is smooth and the game length is appropriate. Modest optimizer game without any theme.

Your running a Viking outpost.  Your goal is to balance how various members balance you settlement and also empower it.  Settle islands and decide which combination of islands you settle for the most points.

This is a very interesting little game that plays in about 45 minutes.  The components are well made and attractive.  The rules are easy to understand and a set of tiles are included to make the game more interesting if you tire of the basic game.

Some of the planning for various tiles and such can have a littrle bit of screwage but it is not overwhelming.

Very typical Euro trash but with a bit more interaction than normal.  Players are buying tiles from a common wheel to power their VP and cash engines and get end-game VPs for things like most islands, longest islands, etc.  

Buying from the common wheel lets players mess with each other when they're short on cash or need a particular island piece or color worker.

First Play: 3/15/2008, Beans Game Day
Impressions after one play: (6)
Cute game with an interesting bidding and purchasing mechanic driven mosty by the 'Wheel Of Vikings'.
Balance is key, and not all scoring opportunities were fully understood in first play through (especially the massive penalty for not properly feeding everyone at the end of the game.
Decisions seem slightly constrained, there are very few total decision points in the game, summarized by:
 Value to bid for first player token (6 opportunities)
 Which color group of vikings to place on the wheel (6 opportunities)
 Which viking/tile combination to pay for (12/#players opportunities per game turn, 6 game turns)
 Which bonus tile to take (if applicable, max 4/game turn for all players)
 Where to place 'stranded' vikings with boatmen (6 opportunities at end of each game turn)

Initial over-empahsis placed on gaining access to special tiles.
Would probably be willing to play this again, but would not seek to add it to my collection.

Upon review, looks like we played some of the rules very wrong - so this is worth another look.

I was initially frustrated due to the lack of opportunity to place workers with the island tiles coming out unbalanced with the random draws in the basic game. It just seems like it made turn order too important, when the right tiles that I needed were scarce. But due to the balancing feature of players in poverty (myself) being allowed to purchase tiles for nothing, I was able to eek out a win, even though the other players seemed to have plenty of gold most of the time. UPDATE: Played a second game with the bidding for turn order, and advanced tiles, and like this a lot more.

Vikings is awesome, and unlike any other Euro we have.  Kind of like an auction game, but with no actual auction, kind of like tile placement, but only in a rudimentary way.

RATING: 7.5
I was excited to land a copy of this for a reasonable price, but I'm a little disappointed. The auction wheel (or whatever it's called) is interesting, and provides the most interesting choices, but I thought the tile-laying/point-scoring aspects of the game to be rather boring. The severe lack of beginning island tiles is kind of annoying, even in a two-player game. I can only imagine how frustrating it would be with four. I'd like to try this again with the advanced auction rules, but until then this isn't my favorite game.

UPDATE: With more plays, I like the game more! A little dry, but still fun.

Great game with interesting choices throughout, yet fairly light and quick overall.  I really enjoy the physical production of this game, looks great.  (Love the spinner)

EDIT - Traded, but only to capitalize on it's value.  Received Game of Thrones 2nd Edition (NIS) and Lords of Waterdeep.

RATING: 7
I don't like the structure of this game: simple placement rules (relatively), but then hideously complex and unintuitive scoring. It's like Carcassonne without the elegance; imagine if Carc had five different types of meeples, which scored in different ways at five different times. Still, I can see that there's a germ of a good game here, once the scoring is internalized, and I'll revisit it later to see if my initial impression is perhaps too harsh.

UPDATE: With a better understanding of the scoring, this game is more fun. It's still clunky though, and frankly luck of the draw seems huge.

My previous play on this was the "basic" game; I finally had a chance to play the "auction" version, and was not much impressed. Because the boatmen are much less powerful, there seems like there is a much larger premium on making sure guys get played when bought and don't sit around waiting for transport. But there just isn't enough control in the purchasing phase, and you are too often screwed for no good reason (because you can't buy the '0'-cost chit under some circumstances, you can be put in the horrible position of being forced to pay large amounts of cash for tiles you simply don't want, or having the only tile you want be the only one you can't purchase at any price).

Anyway, despite this, I felt like it was still a reasonably clever game. But there is just too much better stuff out there.
---
I actually thought this was pretty good; interesting in sort of an analytical-lite kind of way, enough choices and variables to balance to be engaging but not so much as to cause too much stress. Not a buy for me - not interactive or thematic enough - but I certainly wouldn't turn down a game in future.

Wow!  This one was way better than I had expected.  I really like tactical games such as this one where you just do what looks the best every time your turn comes around, and hope it was good enough in the end.  I'd play this pretty much any time, although it seems to be more suited to 2 or 3 players rather than 4.

Updated 5/13/10.

Probably best two-player.  I bought Vikings to be a light, non-confrontational weeknight filler to play with my wife.  It usually does the trick for us.  It's not super deep (we play the base game, not the advanced version), but with repeated plays the decisions do seem to get more agonizing.  It's not the best game ever (the art and colors are downright childish), but it makes us happy.  And happiness should count for something.  

I think it's a great Euro sampler, too. It requires just enough awareness of what your opponent is doing, some indirect conflict, some resource management, some spacial awareness, and finally some abstract-esque planning (If I purchase A now, then s/he will purchase B, the wheel will turn, and I won't be able to purchase C, so I'll be stuck with D, so I should purchase C now, even though it's more expensive, right?).  

After many, many plays, however, I'm starting to find it a bit stale.  In roughly the same time frame, my wife and I could play 2-player Homesteaders, 2-player Vasco da Gama, or 2-player Hansa Teutonica, all of which have significantly more depth of strategy.  I'd be open to trying the advanced version to see if adds anything, but this has become a game that only comes off the shelf now when (1) we're too burnt-out for anything complicated, but are looking for more than a 15-minute card game; or (2) we're introducing Euro games to non-gamers.

Vikings!?!  Not really.  Poor theming and generic euro.

RATING: 4
The price wheel mechanism is an interesting idea but, in this game, it doesn't offer much in the way of interesting choices.  Too often, the difference in value between the best tile choice and second best tile choice is so huge that there is no strategy or tactic involved; just choose the obviously best tile.  Since the presention of tiles is random, it is also random whether or not if you will get a chance to make a meaningful decision.

Very unsatisfying although there is a decision to make about how to lay your tile in your play area.  In my mind, this is a convoluted Alhambra.

Did I mention that it is fiddly to set up and maintain during play, and the scoring rounds have up to 11 different scoring methods?  Given the Byzantine scoring tables this should have been themed with a Turkish motif.

Very interesting set collection and tile-laying game with a unique "pricing wheel" mechanic.  Considering how simple and elegant the rules are, there are many ways to score (and lose) points, which keeps one engaged for the duration of the game.  Great production values too.  The theme has essentially no connection to the actual game, but...viking-meeples!  This is a light-medium Euro done right!

Oh yes - this game has the distinction of being the first game I sourced from Japan!

Plays well with all player counts and is visually appealing. Gameplay is rather straight forward, but there is a bit of planning, so new players may have a tough time with strategy. The game can have the slightest of luck with drawn Vikings and tiles, but I enjoy it because it is fun and strategic and plays in under 60 min.

BOTTOM LINE: vikings is a fantastic family/new gamer game. It also offers alot for the experienced gamer. Very fun easy game with lots of hard choices. 


My criterion for ranking games


http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1) Sense of wonder:    Each game has a great deal of mystery just in the tiles/vikings and which ones will come out and which ones be paired together. I eagerly anticipate the combos and change my strategy each time based on these factors

2) Meaningful/fun decisions.   Great agony over which vikings to buy and which to hope wheels to you. 

3) Player interaction:  There is some interaction in this game as you have to care about what you opponents are doing and how it may affect you. 

4) Components/artwork:  Very nice artwork, great components, tiles are nice. 

5) Game length/complexity:  Very quick game and easy to explain. The game lasts the perfect amount of time that you can play 3 or 4 in a row.

RATING: 8
This game is a blast!  Tile laying, worker management, a little bit of opponent screwage, and a lot of fun.  This is definitely one of those games that has enough depth to draw in a gamer, but is also light enough to be played more than once in a row once you realize that "oh, I should have done this" or "I would really like to try that strategy".  I enjoy this game quite a bit.

There's more game here than I was expecting.  Clearly should never be played with anything but  exactly 3 players due to strong right/left binding.  Player interaction outside of the pricing auction however is distressingly low.

The advanced game seem more complex than interesting.  They add at least three decision spaces to a game which already has four.  I worry about dilution.

This was a great little game that promised to have many plays.  Unfortunately, we bought Stone Age shortly after and it has overshadowed this one.  When we want a short, meeple-themed game, that one usually goes first.

However, the game was solid and offered some interesting choice of strategy.  The theme isn't what one would expect of a Viking game, but it shows they were about more than just pillaging.

Sorry this one sat on the shelf so long.  It really is a fun little game.  Dusted it off after 3 years and still enjoyed it.

RATING: 6
This game embodies a lot of what makes for a traditional Euro game. It has a fairly simple set of rules. The overall game doesn't take very long. The individual turns don't take very long either and there are interesting decisions to make. The theme is pretty thin but that's not a huge drawback for me because I like interesting mechanics and the theme works well enough. 

This game, with experienced players, is the definition of what one may term a Euro-filler game (i.e. a game that can be played in about a half hour and still provide the players with some interesting situations to think about). The player interaction is manifested in a successive set of random, limited markets with market values of items potentially being influenced by the choices of other players. It's very Euro in that your decisions affect other players but you're not "attacking" them (which is kind of funny given the artwork on the box and the general conotations one might derive from such imagery - though the artwork does fit the idea of trying to defend one's self from invaders which is part of the theme).

Horror of horrors! It's a tile laying game with a tacked on theme AND I bought it without playing it first. Actually, its a nice lightweight and attractive game that plays well with 2 or more players. It's easier than it looks and, like all Euros is an exercise in organisation/optimisation and scoring the most points - downside is it's a bit solitare. The auction wheel mechanic is great although the point scoring is a bit fiddly. Overall an enjoyable game that can be played with family or gamers.

After one play -- great game, my 8 y.o. son loved it.  Need another game or two to settle on a rating -- looks like a winner, though!
2nd play went more smoothly, though my husband wasn't too excited about the game.  I think this game needs at least a couple of plays before it really starts to make some sense - especially for new gamers.  I still really enjoy the rondel mechanism and the choices that have to be made regarding whether or not to choose a tile/viking combination that may help you but at the same time it opens up an opportunity for your opponent on the next move.  Looking forward to more plays and to looking over the more advanced rules which some have stated really improve the game.

RATING: 7
I dig games with a bit of per-player spatial positioning (e.g. Alhambra, PoF). Trying to get your islands situated just right without "wasting" too many vikings (placing on the canoe) is challenging and fun. There's probably not quite as much choice in the vikings/tiles wheel as it first appears, since money is very tight you're often forced to just pick the cheapest thing (or at least on my first play it seemed that way). But we also learned that just taking cheap stuff can make island placement a real pain. The only player interaction is in choosing which viking/tile pair to buy, but you could probably take more advantage of the information on other player boards than I did. But also, I think the advanced version, which I haven't tried yet, adds more player interaction. I look forward to trying that. Only 1 game so far. Rating could drop if advanced rules don't measure up.

First played this game with my in-laws.  Love the purchasing mechanic where it gets cheaper as each colored viking gets purchased.  I've been looking for this game ever since, and was happy to see that it was re-released.

I really wish that there were more tiles and vikings.  As it is there is exactly the same about of land tiles for the game...which doesn't add too much variability.  There are a [i]few[/i] extra viking meeples to add variability, but I think they could add about 5 more to make it that much more.

Although lighter in weight, it has a decent amount of strategy. The quick playtime not only makes this a great filler, but also a great gateway game.

There are too many things to optimize, but I love it.

This game is great with two players.  Three players is also okay, but I wouldn't recommend it with four.  With four players, it's too random for my taste.  But with two, it is amazing.  The combination of the tile laying element with the rondel works perfectly.  I'm always up for a game of this, either in person, or on Yucata.de.

A light but interesting and unique euro having little to do with vikings. The wheel mechanic is interesting and if you pay attention to other boards and watch what is coming out you can get pretty clever with your plays.  This kind of game...not too long, not too heavy but interesting, has become my favorite kind of game recently.

Vikings is a fast economic game. Despite the nominal "Viking" theme, no actual exploration or pillaging is involved. The resources in the game consist of coins and several types of ship tiles, island tiles and meeples. In each of 6 rounds, a random set of 12 tiles and 12 meeples becomes available. Players take turns buying and placing pairs of meeples and tiles. There is no direct player interaction, only indirect contention for resources during the buying phase. The most unusual aspect of the game is the pricing wheel, which pairs meeples with tiles and sets their prices.

Rating based on initial impression, will revise with more experience. (And it's Wife Approved, so that's a good sign)

Update: Been four years since I last played this. I think it's about an 8 for two players and I like it a lot. I think it's GREAT with three and should be rated a 9 with that amount of players.

Pretty fun game with lots to think about.  Auction, tile placement, and several interesting mechanics going on at once here.  Several ways to score VPs, and plenty of opportunity for player screwage.  Some randomness with tiles and vikings drawn, but manageable.

Money/VP/costs engine game, but light enough to be played by anyone.
The rondel pricing mechanism is cool along with the "would you like a free steak knife viking with that tile. Placement of tiles & vikings is the usual solo activity to maximise gains and future options.
Enjoyable enough, but I didnt feel I had a lot of control. The best buy is usually fairly obvious and can often be driven by luck as anything else (Is the '0' useful to you? Turn order determine's the price you pay for something better.)
Meh.

If I weren't such a curmudgeon, I might bump this one to a 9. The game never disappoints, and everyone I've introduced it to has liked it. The game has many familiar euro mechanisms. You have to keep the need to feed your people in the back of your mind; you get multiple scoring options, including creating the most of this or the largest of that; you use the Thurn & Taxis "all-of-one-color or one-of each-color" placement rule for one facet of the game; etc.
Nevertheless, the game feels unique. Essentially, players take turns choosing a set to buy from among a dwindling number of sets at different prices. Each set consists of a meeple and a board tile. Each player uses what he has bought to build his individual board and to place his meeples on it to produce an optimal score during the scoring rounds.

This game appears to be a collection of leftover mechanics from some other games, bundled together with a theme that of course makes absolutely no sense at all (a wheel to determine the price of land and vikings? yeah, right). The mechanics are mildly interesting in an accounting sort way, the game itself is somewhere between tedious and dull. Way overrated.

RATING: 8
Starting this out at an 8 because I really enjoyed this game.  However it reminds me a little of St Petersburg.  I also started that one out at 8 but it has dropped w/repeat plays.  This one does seem to have a little more to it though.  Each turn you buy an island tile and a worker (color).  You wind up placing these items on your game board.  They score you either money or vps.  The best part of the game is deciding what to buy.  There is a wheel that determines the price.  Some items are very expensive, but the cost can come down if you are willing to risk waiting on them.  I think though after 1 play, I'm ready for the advanced version.  I'm hopeful that it will add different strategies to the game.  As it stands now, I feel that the games may be a bit formulaic...buy yellow early, pick up blues when you can...pick greens/greys/blacks next depending on situation...last, buy reds.

After 6 plays, dropping this down to a 7.  I still really like it, but in the games I've won, I've had the most farmers.  In the games I've lost, another player has had more than me.  I think too much of it comes down to who has the most farmers at game's end.

I just won a game with 2 farmers while all other players had 3.  Gotta bump it back up to an 8.

The expansion (25 extra tiles) plus bidding for start player was fun even though I got demolished.  I'd like to play it that way from now on...not the demolished part though.

Players are recruiting different skilled vikings and installing them on an islands to earn money and victory points.  Vikings and chunks of island are purchased off a pricing wheel, which gradually cheapens the offerings.  Vikings can be nobles (earn points), scouts (earn points for other vikings), goldsmiths (earn money), fisherman (feed the people) and so on.  Islands are created, Carcassonne style, and the vikings are placed onto them, meeple style, to trigger their abilities.  As a game, it works well with some nice clever systems.  However, the theme seems awfully misplaced here.  Still, rock solid offering (as always) from Hans im Glueck.

A 2015 re-visit with a four player game, not so good.  Too few options, and luck played a huge part - if you were sitting in the right seat when the pieces are revealed, you're golden.  Else you're rust.

This is a very nice midweight Euro.  It plays fast and goes down smooth.  I really enjoy when games give you random combinations of things to place a value on, and this game does that well.

While it is pretty good, it is not the grail some seem to be making it out to be though.

UPDATE Sep 2015
Played this some more, and I'm feeling like it is a one trick pony.  Yes, there is some tension in the bidding, but that's about it.  Ra and Medici both do this type of random-lot valuation bidding much better.

A very good tile-purchasing, pawn-placing game with a puzzle-y aspect to it.   Completely themeless, in fact the pasted-on theme doesn't even make sense, but as an abstract tile game it works surprisingly well.  The devaluation of tiles via the price wheel is clever and somewhat agonizing as taking a cheap tile could cause a big drop in prices for everybody else.   The spatial element of the tile placement offers a pretty simple puzzle to work out, combined with the risk and timing issues of not always getting what you want when you want it.   Those elements of the game are well-balanced without going over the top.    Enjoyable game.

Received this from 2010's Secret Santa exchange...thanks!!

After several plays, I find this game akin to doing a jigsaw puzzle: always looking for the right fit!  Additionally, like a puzzle wherein the last piece is often "lost" so as to yeild the oportunity to place the last piece, so to is satisfaction granted upon seizing the right piece at the last moment - leaving your opponent wishing for their chance to place such a coveted piece!!

A delightful, fresh game with a wonderful buying mechanic!!!

Fell in love with the basic game after just a couple of games.  Haven't tried the "Progress" variant yet because I haven't tired of the original!  However, I did de-rate it from an 8 to a 7 after we noticed that the Final Scoring elements of the game started to seem a bit unbalanced.  It seems like there are too many points awarded for luck-heavy elements (most completed islands and most leftover boatsmen in particular).

Many systems effectively create tension by delaying the satisfaction of goals. There is some worthwhile interaction on the wheel and in endgame majority scoring, but it's mostly about optimizing your own board. Two problems I encountered: (1) If you close off too many islands too early, you'll find yourself with no way to extend islands in the late game, which leads to unsatisfying wasted turns. (2) There's little to generate ambiguity in the last round, so it slows down as players make anti-climactic maximizing calculations.

A pretty standard euro. Buy tiles and meeples and arrange them to generate vps. It uses placement of stuff to generate its theme to an extent and it isn't a bad game by any means. I you want a euro about vikings this game will fit the bill and i'd play it again. Its fairly light and easy and does let you build your little islands so it is sort of satisfying at low mental expenditure.

Vikings is a nice game, with its viking meeples, its rondel mechanism and its carcassone-esque matching of tiles.  I was luke warm on it at first but the game really began to sing when I added in the bonus tiles.

So far so good after one play. We played with the bonus tiles, but not the auction, I think the auction would add a lot, but, would be difficult to value until you understand the rules.

RATING: 7
When you think of a game with a Viking theme, you're thinking of pillaging, plundering, discovery, and probably sailing.  Those ideas are paper thin in Vikings, but it's still a good game to play if you like Euros and especially if you typically have a player count of 3.  This is very much a tile laying game and it's strange that you would use money to buy land tiles and vikings with different functions.  The purchasing mechanism is very interesting in that you can take a tile and viking for free if you meet certain conditions, but when you do, you are making tiles cheaper for everyone else.  It plays pretty quickly and has good decisions to be made which I always appreciate in a game. One criticism seems to be that if you let someone hoard all of the fishermen (blue meeples), they will likely win. It's probably just a matter of letting players know beforehand.

I must say that this game works better if the island- and ship tiles are laid visible to the board BEFORE the auction phase. More blood, more fun. That is against the game rules but sometimes it's better to find own ways.
--------
We made another home rule in my group: We used boatsmen like in basic game rules but we also used the special tiles - so we decided that the special tile "boat" is considered as boatsman at final scoring when the most boatsmen are counted (as well as the original tiles with same function, so we had 10 tiles with that function). That's because most of us were frustrated about unjustice of those special boat tiles when played according to original rules.

I think I bother to play this only if the variation I mentioned before the dashed line is used. Another home rule worked well also but it's not totally necessary in my opinion.

The advanced rules include options to play with an auction and/or special tiles.  The special tiles really open up the strategic options as does the auction, but I feel the auction slows the game down a bit too much.  Regardless, the game can be tailored in various ways to suit one's preferences.

This is a solid, well designed game, and I always feel satisfied after playing it.  But it somehow fails to fascinate - it just doesn't have the sort of draw a game needs to make me want to play again and again.  I'm not sure quite why; although it's a little light for my taste, there is a good bit of strategy in it.  But maybe not enough complexity, or enough direct competition (I have played only 2-player).

So I enjoy the game, and yet I rarely end up playing it, because something else usually seems more appealing.

Update 12-19-09: We have been playing the advanced version more lately, and that has helped to keep my interest.  In particular the bonus tiles help to add  potential long-term strategies, and keep the games from feeling too homogenous. 

1/5/2012 Back down to a 7, which is probably where it belongs.  It is a good game, which we pull out occasionally, but not a favorite.  Note that this is for 2 players: with 3 or 4 I find it less interesting because there is less interaction. For 3 or 4 players I would probably give it a 5 or 6.  

5-4-2012: Played this again a couple of times recently.  Still a solid 7, very satisfying, for 2-player play. 

2-13-2016: Still pull this out for a simple but satisfying 2-player game.

With [thread=816765]four players[/thread] the luck element is slightly stronger, so it might be best with three, and good with two.

Played on BSW and this game is a winner.  Don't know that I need to own, but a good game.  Nice tension in picking tiles and planning for future moves (with your vikings) all the while the market prices change and present new opportunities.  Especially like how you need both the land as well as the dude to put on the land. 

The game plays quickly and one session usually involves more than one game.  Best thing I can say is that I'm not a fan of tile laying games, but I like this one.

I've never played the basic rules and, from what I understand, I'm better off. The basic rules look like they coddle the players too much, while the advanced rules call for some serious viking and island management. There's some serious screwage to go around here.

(2-4 players) It's easy to get hosed on income when you can't get any yellow vikings early in the game and then it's nearly impossible to dig out of that hole. You can trade VP's for gold but that's little help. I think a base level of income each round with a *bonus* for yellow vikings would fix that problem.

Solid medium weight game.  Not something I'll go to every day, but at least my girlfriend seems to enjoy it.  And the bits whore in me loves the viking meeples.

Edit: While I liked this game when it was one of the only games I owned, this is kind of an uninspiring mess.  The decisions aren't terribly meaningful, and it's just kind of bland throughout.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Enjoyable, the price wheel is a clever idea, but the game descends into optimal moves and there's a bit of fiddlyness in the final scorings. I'd like to have seen a different form of tile placement, maybe hexes, maybe exploration as a theme. Give Vikings a go, it may float your boat. But don't expect too much. The only inter-action is determining what your neighbour's choices might be and weighing that against your options. That introduces a certain timing element, but since the tile and meeple draw is random, it becomes much of a muchness.

This is quite fun and plays in under an hour (1:15 w/advanced rules).  The tile laying & viking placement is similar to Carcassonne.  The money wheel is pretty slick in how it reduces the cost of remaining items.  But the game REALLY comes alive with the advanced ruleset.  The best part of the game is the tough choice of saving money vs. buying the most expensive item (to get one of the special tiles).  The "perks" these special tiles give, and the expanded purpose of the boat tiles turn this game from an average one to a possible great one.

While I prefer the advanced version, I do think it's a great idea to have a game that is adaptable for families as well as gamers.  They came up with a great solution by converting a "gateway" family game into a strategic "gamer's game" simply by having an expanded ruleset.

Grade: B+  (advanced game)
Grade: C    (basic)

Played 5+ times: 2-4 players. It's not like St. Petersburg, but it's not NOT like St. Petersburg. SOMETHING about it definitely feels Saintpetey to me. Vikings seems to have more 'game'. Part tricky acquisition, part tile laying, part piece placement, Vikings really packs a lot of tactics into a simple package. Actually is quite easy to learn due to an exceptionally well designed rulebook. I am beginning to think that different # ofplayers requires different variants: 4 players pretty much requires the auction or it becomes horribly unbalanced for players 3 and 4; 2 players seems too easy to use that boatsmen, so maybe use the optional boatsman rule.

Somehow I get the feeling the game doesn't work quite as well with 2 or 4.  My first 3 player game felt just right.  Interesting idea to have a decreasing cost to speed things along.  Many choices, but opportunity dictates the best course from turn to turn.  Will play again.

I generally don't care for tile laying games as there usually isn't enough there to keep me interested, but this one was okay.

I like the rondel mechanism that automatically makes things cheaper as the round goes on coupled with the rule where you can't buy the 0 value meeples unless it's the last of it's color.  It throws a wrinkle into everyone's plans, especially in the later rounds where you are looking for specific tile shapes/meeple colors and so you'll get a 0 value meeple, and then the next one will be 6 or 7 :)

Theme is pasted on, but for some odd reason that doesn't bother me with this game as much as it does with others.

Works great with 3.  With 2 there are too many tiles, and with 4 there are too few.
Around 1 hour, so it doesn't overstay it's welcome, especially if you don't have AP-prone people.

Kétszemélyes "módban" prbóltam ki a játékot. 4-5 játék után azt mondom, hogy ez egy nagyon jó játék. Elég sok mindenre kell figyelni (szigetek lerakhatósága, számunkra fontos bábuk megszerzése, hajók levédése). És ezekkel kapcsolatban ki kell tudnunk azt is következtetni, hogy az ellenfelünk mit fog lépni következőre, nomeg esetleg azután.
A játék egyetlen hiányossága talán a tematika hangulat hiánya. Tulajdonképpen egy absztrakt játékról van szó, egy érezhetően utólag ráhuzott témával.
A komponensek minőségéről nem tudok nyilatkozni, mert csak online játszottam.
Van egy olyan érzésem, hogy több emberrel nem annyira működik jól, mert egyre nagyobb lesz a szerencse szerepe a lapkák sorrendje által.

Kipróbáltam 4 játékossal. Jó volt a megérzésem, hogy így nem sok értelme van, mivel annyira kevés lapka jut egy emberre, hogy semmit se lehet tervezni, előre gondolkodni. Megtartom a 8-as értékelést, de ez szigorúan a kétszemélyes játékra vonatkozik. Négyes értékelését le se merném írni. :)

RATING: 7
You build islands and place vikings with different professions on them. Nobles generate victory points, gold smiths produce money, etc. Then there are enemy ships which threaten your islands and prevent the vikings on them from doing their jobs unless you also have warriors to fend them off.

The major gimmick of the game is the market wheel where you can buy island parts and vikings. Tiles that have been bought are placed in individual areas so everybody is building for himself. Interaction with other players is indirect at best, and the random drawing of tiles and vikings for the market has quite a bit of impact on the game. The advanced rules fix this problem to some extent since the bonus tiles provide incentives for spending more money and jumping ahead further on the rondel than you would ordinarily have reason to, thus rendering the starting order a bit less important. In any case, the advanced rules improve the game quite a bit and open up more avenues of play.

The theme is certainly something that many people will call nonexistent as there is no sailing, no pillaging, no drinking, no fighting (except in a very abstract manner). If that bothers you, Vikings is probably not for you.

Still, Vikings is a fun game with a rather short play time, and almost no downtime because of the quick shopping rounds.

This one is probably a bit under-rated and overlooked here on BGG in my opinion.

Fantastic game! Very engaging gameplay, super tight system, a really great mix of tile placement and a very elegant, but intriguing purchasing system and scoring mechanics.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of Euros and tile placement games. This is what I will think of now when I think purely of a Kiesling game.  If there's any point against it, it's that this really works best as a 3-player game. 2 players doesn't offer enough competition and 4 players offers too much.  All player counts are serviceable, but 3 players is so much the sweet spot that it leaves the other player counts a bit sour.

This is a fun game. I've played it a number of times since purchasing it and it has been interesting - because of randomness in the game it is different every time. That can also be a flaw in the game: if you don't get any gold veeples the first couple rounds, you don't have a chance.

RATING: 8
Initial score of a seven.  Vikings offers a fresh spin on the tile-laying genre by adding a market system that is actually quite intriguing.  The market/drafting of tiles is two-fold because gaining a tile alo means gaining a viking worker (which depending on colour and placement, rewards differently).  Tile placement is also tricky and can lead to either frustration or clever play.  Will have to play a few more times to really get a sense for this one, but so far it seems a strong title.

This is an awesome game if played with the advanced rules. Everything in this game looks spectacular. It has a unique feel to it that I don't get from other games. The auction wheel is clever and loads of fun. You really need to pay attention to what the other players are doing with the pieces in front of them. It can be a little cut-throat, but I love that and it makes the game just that much better. Everyone who has seen it has stopped and asked about it and wanted to play, and once they did wound up purchasing the game themselves. I highly recommend this game to everyone.

Whilst a nice little game with a bit of thinking required, luck can play a preponderant role and basically leave the game playing the player: it is quite possible for a player to have one, or even zero, fishermen at the end of the game through no fault of his, simply because the meeples came out in a such a way that none were ever available to pick on his turn, for example.

This is not a problem in a two-player game, however.

With its streamlined game play and intuitive iconography, Vikings is a joy to play. Like most Euros, it's a touch dry and devoid of direct conflict. I'll take that trade-off. Not the best medium-light Euro because the theme is somewhat thin. Egizia and The Downfall of Pompeii have it beat in that department. In any case, it has quickly earned a place in my keepers.

Vikings should hit on all cylinders: It's a Kiesling game, it's got a unique market mechanic, the vikings have different abilities/values depending on their color, tile-laying is an integral part of the game, and the double threat of the ships and not having enough fisherman to provide food makes for good constraints. And yet, Vikings falls flat for me. 
First off, other than the market, it's more or less multi-player solitaire. Second, I typically like tile-laying games, but I don't get any excitement from building the most  efficient island possible. 
I can see why others would like this game. And I won't say no if someone is keen to play. For me, take it or leave it.

RATING: 7
Updated again: Upon further review, I decided to move the rating back up a notch. Yes, luck did have something to do with my previous win, but further analysis shows that I was wise to take fishermen early to support my vikings and to concentrate on completing islands for the bonus at the end. Maybe I was lucky, but the other players were kind of dense not to realize their populations were going to count against them in the end.
Updated: I decided to knock this one down a notch because of the experience with the most recent game. I think many people will dislike this game because there's a lot of luck involved in how it plays out (unless, I suppose, you play with the variant auction rules for Viking selection and placement). In the game we just played, I was the least experienced, least knowledgeable player at the table, and I won by a wide margin. I'll do a session report for full details.
This is an enjoyable game of managing multiple logistic elements with a fair amount of chance tossed in. Players must balance the need to land different classes of Vikings while building islands while collecting gold. The chance element may be a bit high for some folks, however. You have to make the most of the opportunities presented.

RATING: 8
A good game, and a very original game design.  The amount of control players have is questionable, but I like the weird constraints that the inventive game mechanisms place on your actions.  The wheel thing that drives the game is a totally contrived, game-y device, but it does an admirable job of regulating the game's economy.  Vikings is definitely a game aimed at gamers, but it will always feel "light" because there's so little ability to plan between game rounds.  You see what the wheel of fortune gives you, and you do the best you can with it. 

We use the special tiles and the advanced rules for ferrymen (1 passenger per ferryman), but haven't yet tried the auction.  It seems like overkill - too much analysis for a game of this weight and length.  For what it's worth, I'll mention that Vikings is kind of a pain in the ass to teach to new players.  There's a lot to explain for a game of its weight and length.  Once you get going, though, it plays effortlessly.  Best with three players.

[Update] After trying the game with the full advanced rules, I have mixed feelings.  I like the ability to throw out a viking and choose the order of the vikings around the wheel.  I don't like the money auction for start player.  Why?  Because it seems like the main thing to be determined is not who gets to go first, but rather who gets to be screwed by going last.  If the player to your left is Mr. Moneybags Perpetual Start Player, you really get screwed.  Also, bidding to start before you even know what tiles will be available just feels . . . dumb.  Next time, I'd like to try it with the advanced viking placement "draft" but with the traditional rotating start player.

Tile laying games aren't my jam and Vikings doesn't change that for me. But the game has some interesting things going on with the rondel and the money and deciding what's more important, taking a tile you can lay down immediately, or taking a meeple you can lay down immediately on a tile. Unfortunately, I think there is a fair bit of luck involved with how the tiles come out and the turn order. I won my first play despite not knowing anything about the game or what I was doing early on. That's very telling for me when a game allows a newbie to comfortably beat two seasoned players.

Rating after 3 plays, two with basic rules one with advanced rules. Feeled really fresh when trying this. Scratches somehow the same itch like Guatemala CafÃ© (one board for picking up resources and another to place them) but feels less dry. But: imbalanced draws out of the bag may screw last player if played with basic rules. Advanced rules reduce the luck factor and offer more tactic and strategic choices. It's really great how these two rule sets make on one side a family friendly game and  on the other side a low luck game for geeks.
Even though I like this game very much I must admit that it is once again an Euro with pasted on theme and I am not sure how fast it will fade after repeated plays.

While I am looking forward to trying the version for experienced players, there is plenty going in the basic version for me to play it many times more!

Another one of the very fine games. Sort of similair in actions to Saint Petersburg, where you have to keep a balance between all different characters.

In Vikings you have to balance out the guys that bring you money, bring you food, bring you points and defend you from the viking ships!! And those guys love to attack!! You have got to be on your toes!! 

But it's not all that straightforward, as other players try to do the same thing, so you have to keep a sharp eye on what's going on. Very balanced mechanism between points and money. 

Besides the push and pull of money and points, you also have to keep in mind the many different bonus points awarded at the end of the game, as those will be sometimes your swinging balance points. 

I like this game a lot. Plays quickly, is very fun and not too much of a brain burner. And that makes it very enjoyable in my eyes.

A definite winner for me. Some decent interest before it was released but then I didn't hear too much about it. I picked it up on a whim and wasn't expecting great things but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a fairly simple game of collecting various sets of vikings and laying the tiles appropriately to maximise your scoring but it seems like the sum is greater than the constituent parts with this game. The advanced rules add a little more to think about with the special tiles and the fact that the boatmen can only take one viking each. Great fun.

RATING: 8
The price wheel is an interesting system of acquiring tiles and vikings to be placed on them. The fact that one always acquires a tile and a viking together gives the player some hard choices, as tiles must fit in a certain way and vikings of different colors have different functions. The advanced version adds bonus tiles that make evaluation even harder.

On the negative side, the game feels a little abstract, despite some thematic elements. There may be some turn order issues, and I don't think the auction variant that deals with them is worth the additional brain stress. Also, the boatmen bonus is a little unbalancing under the basic rules. However, those are minor issues in a quite good game.

Very good game with an fairly unusual gameplay.

This isn´t a very deep strategy-game, but it offers enough to get your brain working throughout the game. It also plays very well with any number of players, especially with 2, even though it´s an auction game.

The only bad thing I found in this game is the "yellow worker" +2 tile (from the expansion included in the game) which is simply too good, especially as there are +1 tiles, too. I hate to have pieces in a game that a clearly better than others, while you can get them the same way.

RATING: 5.5
Played it only once; it's short and easy to explain, but I need to play it again to judge it properly.  While it has its merits, it seems like it has problems.  For example, it seems like you need to be balanced between getting the various meeple colours to win -- a feature I like very much in E&T, of course.  But you even when you win a hard-fought auction to buy the meeple of your choice, it's often associated with a tile that won't let you play it (due to the island pattern in that row)!  So, it invariably ends up waiting to be placed.  So, then you end up needing lots of grey meeples to place the other ones which couldn't, which wastes lots of auction turns -- one to get the meeple, one to get the grey meeple to use the other one.  (But one grey meeple plus the "canoe" bonus tile allows you to place 5 of different colours, or all of one colour, which is fantastic --> FIGHT for this bonus tile!!!)

At first glance, most important colours:
0) Grey -- depending on how lucky you are with being able to place your other meeples immediately upon purchase.
1) Yellow (at least one early, or you'll suffer during the auctions/acquire meeples phase, and you won't get any bonus tiles for buying the most expensive meeple).
2) Blue -- rarely affected by Viking boats, and each is worth lots of positive points (and lack of negative points) at the end of the game.
3) Black -- protects your other meeples, which is worth points or money.
4) Green and Red -- points, duh!

Vikings is elegant in its simplicity and reveals room for different strategies as you play more.  The meeple and tile selection rule for times when you are broke prevents it from being a 10.

A nice euro game for 2-3 players.  It's enjoyable to figure out how to build your area and juggle the cost/reward of island tile placement while doing so.  The theme is weak but the play is solid enough to make it a game worthy of playing.

RATING: 7
Hey now, this is interesting. The dual-lot purchasing thing is quite original and fun. You are buying a meeple and a tile, and ideally they go together but maybe they don't, so you'll have to separate them and figure out how to make them useful later. I was going to say it's underrated but it's in the top 200... I just never knew about it!

What a fascinating mechanic for a controlled auction of goods!

Vikings is basically a set collection/tile laying game, driven by the 'gold wheel' set on the game board, which is manipulated/manipulates an auction of Viking meeples and of the Ship/Island tiles they settle.

Raised to a 7.25, as I work in the Progress tiles as well.

How these are laid out determines wealth, VP's and productivity.  A very nicely thought out game with lots of potential; I'm starting this at a 7 based on a 1st 3-player solo.

Warning: If you have AP, this one will be like a punch in the face:
-Tactical 1 turn optimizations

-variable asset valuation at endgame.
-Advantages for counting

And this just in the simple version of the game. It's hard to be more complicated than this for a mostly tactical game.

I don't think Michael Kiesling will ever be my favourite designer in the world, but this effort highlights a problem that I'm increasingly having with Eurogames: Players are dumped into a themeless (What's that wheel supposed to be? Fred Flintstone's dumb waiter?) and fairly chaotic game that has no parallel in reality, then left to sink or swim. All of the options (the characters, landscape and bonus tiles) are presented to the players with no indication of what's coming later, so only short term tactics are possible. Better games have much more manageable levels of randomness.

LOVE the board with the spinny wheel and the little viking meeples.  The game has a St. Pete thing going with the variable costs and the money/VP tradeoff, but less control and less depth than St. Pete (though it is still a drafting game at heart).  I would like to play the advanced version.  The part where you have to guess which tiles you are likely to get in the future isn't really my forte.

Yes, the theme is indeed completely irrelevant. (2 plays)

RATING: 9
Clever auction/buying game with a tenuous grasp of theme.  Ignore the viking link and you have a very clever "reducing price" mechanic in the centre of a game that is very elegant to play.

The game presents many agonising choices and the pain of having to pay 8  for a viking/tile combo makes the game come alive.

There's luck in the order that the tiles come up, but everybody sees the same tiles.  If you don't pay the big money for the tiles you need, then you get left with all the boats and nobody to repel them.

A small, quick game that worth 30 minutes of anybody's time.

Neutral - on occasion

Short time length is always a big plus! 

After having more plays (in the basic game) on Yucata, I am now much more positive toward the basic game. Yes, it has less meat, but it progresses much more fluently. I found the variant on Yucata: no-advanced-auction + bonus tile is probably pretty good. It has some meat of the advanced game but keeps the game flow smooth.

Almost a perfect Euro, short, relatively easy to learn, with both good tactical and strategic choices. Also, the tempo of auction created by the wheel is good. But lack some overall climax, it's kind of game that round 1 feels much as same as round 6.

First played June 26th, 2007. Taught in 15min, played in 45 min. This takes a bit to figure out, or so it did for me. The rules take about 15min to explain however it's worth it. It will seem complicated, however it's not as complicated after you get the hang of it. Throw out the first game as a learning/understanding experience. You will need it to figure out the mechanics of the game. The game itself is quick. Once you get in the flow of it, it goes faster. Each player is given a starting area, a start island tile, $25 and 10 VPs. 12 vikings are drawn from the bag and placed in order of (starting at zero) blue, yellow, green, red, black, and grey. Tiles are also placed in the order drawn with island segments at zero going up and ship tiles at 11 going down. The start player is randomally drawn and then each round it passes to the left. You may purchase any viking/tile group at the cost, except the zero tile there are more than one of that color viking (unless you can't pay). You may trade one VP for $1, however not vice versa. Once the zero group is bought, the wheel moves clockwise to make everything a bit cheeper. After purchasing the group you may place the tile if you can in your island area. You must place a tile orthogonal to another one and it must be face up(water/cliff at the bottom). Island tiles mush be place so that it's possible to complete an island with a start and an end. Your starting island tile must be placed with your first tile drawn. The first ship tile may be placed in column 1,2,or 3, however the next must be adjacent to the first and the first three slots must be filled before placing in the 4th column. Once a tile is placed you must either place the viking on that tile(if you can) or place in the homeworld. Boatsman always get placed in the homeworld. Going clockwise, each player buys until all groups have been purchased. You play 6 rounds in the base game. After the odd round you have a small score (only the unthreatened goldsmith produce $3 each) and after each of the even rounds you have a big score (warriors produce ship stated VPs/$ for repelled ships; Nobels produce 2VPs, Scouts produce 1VP for themselves and all goldsmith/fisherman behind them, and Goldsmith produce $3; all of which are unthreatened). If a ship is present in the first space the mast color determines how far down the vikings are threatened. (yellow threatens all except the fisherman) Before Big scoring, you may use your boatsman to move all of one viking type or one of each viking type. Last(6th) round you also have a end game scoring. The most boatsman gets 10VPs, each $5 gold is 1VP, most completed islands is 7VPs and the largest completed island is 5 VPs. All ties, all involved players each recieve the VPs.

Very Euro-feeling game.  Neat wheel mechanic for determining cost of purchases.  The Viking theme isn't really that strong (since there's no combat, looting or plundering), but the game still works very well.

After nearly 50 plays, I finally tried the "Advanced" rules.  [Basic game plays so crisp that I hadn't felt the need for additional rules.]  The advanced rule bonus tiles and modification to the boatsman rules are a neat little twist.  They add some additional considerations to your decision-making process each turn - not completely game altering though.  Glad to try the advanced rules.  May try them again, but am just fine with the basic rules.

After many plays, it's a really good sign that I've seen people win in several different ways.  Note: you're hard pressed to win if you don't get one of the 3 end-game bonuses; however, there is definitely not an automatic "play for this specific bonus and win" sneak-path through the game.

A terrific recent addition to www.yucata.de

Well, I've only got one playing in thus far.  It was *very* brutal and unforgiving.  One player was out of the running by the second round.  I fell out of the running by about the fourth round.

I'm also still not convinced the advanced game is better.  Why exactly do you need an auction or rules breaking tiles?  I'm definitely going to push for a simpler game next time...

The more I've thought on it, the less I've really wanted to play this game again.

A tight game that plays swiftly and gives the players meaningful decisions to make, but in my opinion is let down by being a bit too "blocky" with the player actions.

If you like beating your neighbour then this will rank much higher for you.

But it features horned warriors on the box (slap on the wrist for the artist) and the meeples...look more like Jay Kay than Erik the Red! As for the game itself - the basic game works well enough but it is the advanced version that is the real draw. The mechanics and scoring of the latter are a little fiddly and unintuitive which makes it tricky for a first-timer to figure out suitable tactics (though it helps to have already played the basic game). However, it is worth persevering because Wikinger becomes really interesting when players feel confident enough to splash out on the auction or on purchasing more expensive tiles.

As noted elsewhere, this game would have been a must buy about 6 years ago.  Now, I think it will have a hard time getting through the clatter.  Part of it is the theming.  I am not someone who thinks this is the end-all be all, but if a game is going to stand out for me today, its theme and mechanisms really need to have something to do with one and other.  I realize that Vikings are the flavor of the week in Euroland, but why is it that we are now on the third or fourth Viking game with precious little in the raping and pillaging category?  The "cost rondle" is clever, but should be wedded to an activity with dimminishing costs for the same activity.  Is it really cheaper for the 3rd player to defend himself against Viking long ships?  Perhaps a civilizational game where the rondel represented investments in technology?  Anyway, this is a perfectly fine Eurogame.  If you are new to the hobby you might find it quite clever.  But if you've been in it for a while, you will probably want more horned-helmet for your dollar.

Initial rating

Finally got to play this and played with 2 players advanced rules [i]including[/i] the auction which I think is important, getting to choose some of the order of the Vikings and getting to buy first are advantages that should be bought (or in 2 player altered I guess, even 3 player would even out BUT depending on which Vikings come out this is more or less important depending).

This is clearly a 2 or 3 player game, sure it works with 4 but the lack of control would not be compelling and of course people that played with 4 will have lower ratings.

Our 2 player game FELT off.  First, there were very few "starting Island" pieces in the first 3 or 4 rounds so of course the 1 or 2 that came out got bought up right away otherwise you would have to throw out most the tiles you bought.  Due to this and also a lack of "gold guys", it seemed we didn't have enough money, after we played one round and both had no money so we actually started the game over but basically had close to the same problem AND if barely any "gold guys" come up, you have barely any money for the next round. You could try to wait for tiles to get cheaper but then you risk losing the one or two critical tiles and/or guys that you need.  Third, barely any grey guys came up rounds 2,3,4 and 5 and with the advanced rules, this means not getting to move barely anyone onto the board unless you get the canoe tiles. 

So as I say, this all felt very "off" during play BUT by the end of the game most things worked out where we both had a good number of islands built and a good number of Vikings on the board so maybe this is just the way the game is I guess? It does seem that this whole balance relies too much on the random draw, I am tempted to make a rules that says at least 2 island start pieces should be up for grabs in round 1 and 2 but I'll leave it for now. (we did take 5 dollars each at start of round 2 and 3 each at start of round 3).  

So right now I am cautiously optimistic as it should be a great little 1 hour middle weight with a ton of scoring things to watch out for and vy for so decisions are interesting throughout (typical of K&K games)

This game gets better every time I play it and I've still to play the "advanced" version.

JUN 2010 I've knocked it up a whole point after my last game and I came a resounding last in that. Just such a clever game without hurting your brain.

Do not play this with 4 - only 6 rounds so players 1 and 2 get two first turns but players 3 and 4 only one. So as a 2 or 3 player game, up it's rating goes again.

RATING: 5
I like the basic mechanics.  But, there are a couple of issues for me.

1) I feel like there needs to be a bit more going-on.  I've yet to play the advanced game and that could very well address this issue.  I hope to convince others into playing the advanced game next time.

2) There just doesn't seem to be enough tiles in a 4 player game.  As such, I prefer the 2 and 3 player games.  Again, the advanced rules add additional tiles which may address this issue as well.

It's definitely dry and has nothing to do with vikings beyond the theme but it's pretty interesting and a bit fun.  Definitely not something I will buy or play often as it's just way too abstract but I can appreciate the strategies.

You know how, for some reason, you're really good at some games and not at others (probably something to do with how our brains work!) - well this is one that I really 'get' and often win.

After the first two games, I rated it a 5 and didn't play it for about a year and a half.  Then I played it again and enjoyed it.  It's got an interesting mechanism for buying tiles and meeples.  And, for that matter, for placement.  Maybe it's just because I won.  Still, it's probably not destined for a rating higher than 6.

This game was totally overlooked by the players of its age. We played it a lot and it is still something I always enjoy, in both game mode. Actually it is getting more and more popular now. (2010)

The basic mode works fine for a quick game, but the advanced mode is preferable if you have time.

RATING: 7
I have only played the basic game so far. I like it a lot, and wavered between rating it a 7 or 8. The basic game is a nice, somewhat random light/medium-weight game which, with its total lack of thematic integration is a perfect example of the German game genre, in the same vein as games such as Ra, Pizzaro & Co, and many more.

The advanced game - which at this point I haven't played - seems to add a bit of weight to the game with only a bit more complexity. I can't imagine liking the advanced version less than the basic game.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (January 2015)

It is weird that a game about Vikings doesn't include pillaging but so far I have enjoyed my Vikings' games. When I read the rules and I saw the resemblance to Carcassonne (a game I heavily dislike) I thought I wouldn't like it but I do. 

On the good side, the game plays very fast. You can finish a game under 1 hour with 4 fast players, however it has some interesting decisions (basically which Viking/Tile to purchase, but this decision has many ramifications). The game looks gorgeous and the wheel is great. 

On the bad side, it seems Vikings is expensive for what comes in the box and it is on the light side of the weight game spectrum. Not a bad thing per se but nowadays I prefer heavier games. It has a weak theme (I don't feel it). Sometimes luck of the draw can be overpowering and you cannot get in any way what you planned for. The tiles orientation could be much clearer but this is a minor quibble.

Bottom line, Vikings wasn't what I was expecting (thanks to the name and box art) but it is an ok game to play from time to time. Perhaps one of the best tile laying games I have played and I don't generally like those. For now I want to play again with the progress tiles variant. It is a borderline 6.0 for me.

I like playing with the basic (non-auctioned starting player) rules but using the special tiles.  There's a lot going on but you don't feel like a viking at all.  I missed a huge rule from the translation because I didn't look closely at the pictures.  Your island tile must touch the mainland OR one of your tiles.  This could be above or below one of your tiles, not jut to the right.  It's much easier to play with the right rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a better game than it has any right to be.  The wheel drafting mechanic is innovative.  The constant left-half shortages add frustration and detract from the fun.  I've tried the advanced rules, and while the bonus tiles are interesting I'm not a fan of the auction variant.  It adds strategy and I suppose makes Vikings a better game, but I don't think I really want a better game.  I want Vikings to be a 45-minute game that makes me think a little.

Has value to my collection above and beyond a normal 7-rated game, as my wife both adores it and is much better at it than I am.  This game gets my favorites to the table more often as a result.

Good game.  Like the hiring viking mechanic - even though you may have no money for one round you can still get something that can't do anything than help you.  Like the strategy envolved in this game and is short enough that it doesn't wear out its welcome.  **Second play** Just as fulfilling as the first game, played with the progressive rules leaving out the auction part.  The additional tiles don't do a whole lot but having the tiles that you replace with matching buildings can really be helpful as I collected all of them - still lost by a few points mostly because I believe I played one in the wrong spot.  Raising my rating as this game doesn't seem like it will get worn out to me for a long time, second play left me yearning to play again.

RATING: 8
Much more enjoyable game than I thought it would be from my initial impression when opening the box. Not as complex as it looks at first. The pricing rondel really adds a lot to the game and makes you think about every move and how it will benefit you and the other player(s). Have only played two players, and would like to see how the gameplay changes and scales with three and four.

RATING: 8.5
Only reason this isn't a 9 for me is because I really disliked it with 4p.  Way too swingy, too easy to get left behind/boxed out.  Being "forced" to lose VP's for $ because there's nothing you can afford is pretty lousy.  I adore the 2p game though.  Love the rondel, love the planning ahead, love that it's a tight enough economy but not impossible (as it was in the 4p game).

7/20/2014 - This is a decent, light tile laying game. It doesn't always feel like you have a ton of choices, but the buying and placing of the tiles do present some interesting decisions.

7/12/2015 - After several more plays, I'm seeing a lot more choices in this game. The thing is, you have to play well early on and control your economy and island layout, or your choices start to disappear. There is still randomness, and you could get hurt by bad tile/meeple draws, but its a lot less likely than I initially thought.

Funny little auction bidding mechanic game. Involves alot of blocking as the way of interact with your opponents. Quite easy to learn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It really is a much better game than a '6' rating would indicate.  It's just that I don't care for making sub-optimal moves in order not to set someone else up.  There's nothing wrong with that in a game, I just don't care for it.  For people that don't mind this, this is a really good game.

REVISION: The more I play the game, the more I like it.  I've played a couple of times now with the basic game rules, but using the advanced tiles (the only basic game rule modified is that a Boatman (grey viking) only moves 1 viking unless you have the special tile).  I am really enjoying the game more this way, and I'm finding the "set someone else up" aspect to be less with each passing play (more to do with experience, I think, than the mixed basic/advanced rules).  This hybrid of the basic and advanced rules is mentioned on the yellow sheet somewhere, I believe.

Vikings is a popular tile-laying, economic game that has been out for a few years now. Basically players buy sets of tiles and vikings of different kinds and place them - following certain rules - into a grid they have in front of them. Certain vikings only go on certain rows and score differently. The tiles consist of islands, on which vikings are placed, or ships who attack the vikings along columns. If you don't have warrior vikings to protect against the ships you are forced to place, the vikings in that column do not score or generate money. After 6 rounds the game ends. The most innovative part of the game is the pricing wheel. As land/viking combinations are purchased, the prices get lower and lower. Sometimes it is worth paying more for a combo than waiting for the price to drop.

We played with an advanced rule set called the "Progress" version that adds an auction for start player, choices for how to distribute vikings around the wheel, tougher rules for the "boatsman" vikings, and special scoring tiles that can be acquired. I hadn't played THIS version before and I think it is a significant improvement and I don't think I'll ever play the basic rules again. The basic rules get a 6 out of 10 for me, but the Progress rules bring the game up to a 7. A solid play.

I took me over half a dozen plays to rate this an eight. There's more to it than is readily apparent, and with experienced players you can finish a game in 35-40 minutes. 

In vikings you lay tiles as your own clan explores farther inland. The warriors defend the coast, the nobleman live nearby, the scouts head inland looking for resources, and the goldsmiths and fisherman provide wealth and food. You purchase tiles that are paired with a "veeple" of one of the above types. The purchasing is actually very interactive, and unlike a lot of other games, there are plenty of times when plunking down a huge amount of cash will not destroy your own position and will sufficiently undercut your opponent's. Great stuff. Good for both casual and heavy gamers. 

Update: First play with the special tiles. Much to my surprise, these add a pleasant layer to an already good game. 

The base game is a heavy-lifter in my collection: always delivers, great decision-making in a short time-frame. The special tiles (without the auction) are gold. After a half-dozen plays with them, I've upgraded my rating to a 9. Never would have expected it.

Entirely solid, although after 3 plays I do wonder what this game contributes to the literature overall.  Players acquire both Vikings (in varying colors) and land tiles, using a modified Dutch auction system.  The Vikings provide varying income and VP's depending on their color and placement.  The land tiles create end game scoring opportunities, and also have certain placement rules which will make different ones valuable to different players, depending on how they fit together (beginning, middle and end types), and whether their placement can support a viking at the time.  Additionally, players will necessarily be taking enemy Viking ships which need to be defended against.

I think that the choosing mechanism is interesting but the scoring mechanism is a little mundane and could have used some of the creativity seen in Ra.

The game plays quickly and does have some tension, but there are also times when it plays itself.

[Addendum]  I've now played with the advanced game and I find that the game holds up much better than on first impression.  It gets requested quite often.  I appreciate more now how the need to collect, build, and populate islands is actually quite original and creates some fresh challenges.  The game has become much more than just collecting stuff that scores points.

This is a good game, quick to teach. Played it 3 times now.  Has some elements of Carcasonne, which is definitely not my favorite game. I like this one better.   I bought it looking for a game that my wife would enjoy playing when we have other couples over.  She liked the vikings theme so I grabbed it.  The first time we played,  I think it was over in under an hour. So it's a quick game to play with a decent amount of interaction.  The wheel is cool,  like everyone else seems to be saying.  Until now,  when we played with other couples (non-gamers) we'd play Hacienda all the time.  Wanted another option,  and this one fits well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There is far too much luck in this game. The thing that really bothers me is the rush to buy starting island tiles. Everyone needs those tiles so a lot of the early round decisions are trivial as players grab them. The tile distribution and your place in turn order can hugely impact your chances to score well. 

The mechanisms are clever, but there just isn't enough possibility to plan and strategize to hold my attention.

I could see how this would be a really cool game, but my first (and only) session on this one was not that great.  We only had a few gold smiths come out which means I was left with pre-programmed decisions.... and then I won.  So, there are problems with the game, but the board and pieces are cool and I bet most of the time it plays well.

One of many games I'd like to play a lot of, as it feels like there's some depth I haven't uncovered. I suspect that it should be more of a battle than how I've played it thus far.

Feels similar to Alhambra.

Photos of the game are misleading - the final positions always look similar and boring with each row lined up with its individual colour. Getting there is more interesting than you might expect.

very nice game, i think.  This one seems to be getting a bad rap, not sure if all the criticism is based on playing by the wrong rules, or if they didn't experience the advanced game.

I'd still like to try the progress rules and see if they change my perspective on the game.

An excellent light-middleweight bidding game. Players bid on tiles using the unique auction wheel and try to build up their islands. A simple and quick game to play, although there are many items to keep in mind for endgame scoring (much like Ra or Goa).

Decent tile laying game with a neat drafting system. The player who picks most economically from the wheel will probably win in the end. Theme doesn't really come through that well as you are just defending yourself against anonymous raids and nobles are the least interesting guys for you to have. Six rounds of play breaks the balance a bit for four players as the players later in the starting turn order are only starting one round each.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I prefer this one with 2, although it's fine with 3. However, more players means less for you to do, with makes it less predictable and less forgiving, which is not the best combo. Also, with 2, you cannot leave yourself in a position where only one type of island can be played on your board (e.g. only island ends), because your opponents will definitely get the last one and force you to get rid of all these tiles, which hurts a ton.

I had though Hawaii was pretty original, but when I played this I think I saw where Daigle got some of his ideas from. I still think Hawaii is an improvement, but this was fun. I was so exhausted the day I played this that I barely remember how it worked, unfortunately. Oh, hey, I gave it a 6? OK...

Excellent with 2, 3 or 4 players.  Lots of things to think about at once.  
We're happy we followed the recommendation to play with the progress rules but not the start auction. 
Vikings felt fresh and interesting for ~35 games, and thereafter was still a fun pastime occasionally.

I dont hear about this much and picked it up because of Rahdo's runthrough of it. Really nice tile laying game that plays best at 3, offers interesting decisions while clocking in at about an hour. For something ranked just outside the top 200 I don't see this game mentioned much. It's out of print but if you see a copy for cheap at a swap (like I did) then don't hesitate to pick this up.

The Good: A fun "purchase, then place tiles & meeples" game. The basic game is a little heavier than a gateway game. Plays fairly fast and does not overstay it's welcome. A neat "wheel" mecahanic to rotate purchase costs. The components are very well done. One of the things I love about this game is the wonderful help-icons on the board that keep you from having to go back and look at the rules. Also nice reference cards.

The Bad: Some strategy gamers may feel the basic game is too light after a few playings. However, there is an advanced game, which adds more strategy. In the basic game, the mix of tiles and meeples that comes out seems to vary wildly, giving each game a completely different feel. This creates some games where money is VERY tight, other games where you have an excess. Some may like this, but I found that this caused some games to be way too easy, with fewer meaningful decisions.

I want to like this game more than I do, and I keep thinking that might happen down the road, but right now I just can't get over the complete irrelevance of the Vikings theme, which feels like it was just chosen at random for lack of anything more intuitive or appropriate to the game mechanics.  

The mechanics work fine, by the way, and the wheel offers an interesting variation on worker cost, but man oh man, why Vikings?

RATING: 6
When I think of a Viking game, I expect to figuratively chew on my shield, swing my virtual axe and feel the sea spray in my face.  However, Wikinger/Vikings is a clever Euro-game.

Wikinger offers an interesting puzzle to work on. You need to do multiple things right to get the highest score. The motiff is all about Vikings - raiding boats, defending your shores, etc. For me, the lack is that the activities of the game are divorced from the game's theme. You evaluate how much gold to spend, which shaped islands you need, which types of Vikings you need, and whether you'll be helping the next player too much by failing to do something.

Wikinger/Vikings' game mechanics are good. The price wheel is innovative. Overall the game is really quite clever.  If you like Euro-games, I suspect Wikinger/Vikings may be a game you will enjoy.  I will just have turn to Fire & Axe for my virtual shield biting.

Game mechanics are strikingly similar to Palaces of Carrara, but the ending doesn't sneak up on you like in Palaces.  Very abstract at first, but after two plays it all makes sense and is very fun.

2-Player is fine, but lacks a bit in tension.  I think the sweet spot is 3-player.

UPDATE:  Too many similarities to Palaces of Carrara.  Putting this one up for trade/sale.  I think POC is better.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent 2-player game.  I'm not sure that I like the advantage of having zero gold though, it almost completely eviscerates the money strategy since there are times where you really really really need to run out of money.  I would have also flipped the order of the blue and the gold.  Getting start island pieces also matters quite a bit.

That said, this game is fun.  I just like playing it.

Probably wouldn't like it as a 3+ player game though, too random.  It would be like Finca.  Good as a back and forth, but completely chaotic with more than 2 players.

RATING: 6
Fun light weight game that has a mix of luck and guess work. I find playing with a modification of the progressive rules (use the bonus tiles but scrap the auction placement) works well. Most games have a close finish - if you don't forget about the importance of feeding during the final scoring.

Good tile-placement game with an original selection wheel mechanism. The basic version is OK, but not really extraordinary. The advanced rules add an additional layer via extra tiles (impacting actions or scoring) and improve the game experience. Fishermen are extremely important in the final scoring - don't forget them (but turn order is important - as the last player, you will have less opportunity to get fishermen than the start player)!

I was going to rate this an 8 But there is a definatey a huge advantage for the player starting as first player in a four player game. With two or three players this s fine bcaue the number of rounds.

Perhaps starting rules for first player starts on 10; second on 11; third on 12 and fourth on fourteen

Or second player gets  one money more; third one vp more and fourth one money and one VP. althouggh the first looks to be fairer.

I rate it a 5 for 4 P
7.5 for 3 P

RATING: 3
This game is really dry and have no link at all with the viking theme. It's just a buy tiles and place it on your board type of game. There is no much too it, the expansion adds more stuff, but it only make it more complex and challenging, not necessarily more appealing and fun.

Now, I am trying to think of an interesting mechanic worth noting in this game and I cannot find any. Some could say it's the wheel that allows you to change the price of the tiles easily, but many other games does that without the need of fancy components. So it's not a new mechanics, it's just that the wheel makes it more convenient to play.

But if you like abstract euro game, well I guess you could like it, it could be playable with non-gamers. At least the basic rules.

RATING: 8
This has been so far a very good game.  Not quite amazingly good, but very good!  Definitely play the advanced game.  We haven't tried the auction variant yet.  The bonus tiles make it a little more interesting and less luckish.  The game is different every time depending on what tiles and vikings come out and in what order.  The tile laying aspect is fun, although difficult and hard to plan!  Money is usually undervalued at the end unless you happen to get the tile that makes it more worth while.

Enjoyable Euro fare in which you must decide what you will buy from the wheel on your turn.  If you buy the most expensive item, then you receive a bonus.  Take the cheapest and it is always free.  Buy anything in between you pay the price and get no bonus.  As well, islands must match up in whichever row they belong.  I would recommend moving straight to the advanced game right away although we never auctioned off for start player.

A novel game board with tile buying at changing prices. Do you pay top dollar for the tile you want or risk other players buying it first if you wait for it to become cheaper? End of game bonuses add to the tactics and influence tile priority.

Played a 2-player progress version, but without the auction system (which seemed over-complicated on paper). Really enjoyed the bonus tiles and the trade-off in generally having to buy a boat to get them.

Oh yeah, that's right. On the one side it's possible to play and win stone cold blitzed. Which is how I lost. Every time so far. Someday I'll win this bastard. (good with any number, heck it's random, *of course* it's good with 'any number'). Fun game.

[UPDATE] I have managed to crack the code, and now often win. There are enough VP conditions here that playing a few times is useful to be able to better plan for them. I always expect an hour, but it tends to go longer, maybe 90 minutes of fun, including setup/breakdown, and a rules refresh.

Unlike many others, I maintain that this game is NOT LIKE Carcassonne - Yes, it has m/veeples and tiles, but that's all. The tile-laying aspect is only a severe restriction on players' options and any sense of discovering or creating a landscape is completely absent.
The game mechanics has no relation to Vikings whatsoever, it could be as well a game of company management with cubicle tiles.
Nevermore.
(UPDATE, cca half a year, ten yucata and six live games later):
Hey, the theme's really rather weak, but it is inside, together with a big piece of game. Vikings are good game for a family or couple, as the rules are not too difficult and direct interaction is minimal...outside of the purchasing - there the blood boils. Planning works with 2p, not so sure about the other numbers.

This one sat on the shelf for a very long time before it got its first play, mostly because it was obvious from the first rules reading that this is not a colourblind friendly play, and one of my regular opponents is colourblind.

After three attempts (with basic rules, advanced without auction and advanced with auction), I give it up. The game feels flat and not offering enough interesting choices (they seemed too similar and sometimes obvious). The advanced version is more captivating, but still too constrained and no fun at all. 
You do no feel any sense of achievement or any possibility of smart play. 
I thought that I'd have liked this game, but it proved annoyingly inconcludent.
We tried it with 3 and 4 (twice); maybe it's better with 2 player.

One of the most original games of the last decade. Plays fast, simple rules and yet enough depth en therefore never boring. 
If you like tile laying games this one is for you. And the very original way to buy these tiles, is what makes this game special.

Minus: 2

Played very well with two, three and four players, although I had to learn the hard way that the relative worth of money scales quite sharply downward with more players.
Regarding the advanced version, we've only tried it with two players so far and decided to bypass the auction, playing with the advanced tiles but with basic setup - this plays a lot faster and you don't lose a lot of strategy, we feel.
Played 25+ times.

While the game is a high-quality production in my book, it loses a few points for the confusion it causes in the eyes for first time players.
However, once you understand how everything works, it's an enjoyable experience and a lot of fun to play.  Don't let one player monopolize the fishermen!  [i]I learned that lesson the hard way![/i] 
Definitely need to add this to my collection.

What a fun little game. Might have to add to my collection. Rating may not get beyond an 8, but very good filler game.

[Update] Just picked up a copy. I've been playing it online quite a bit and I have to say this is a new favorite for me. I'm raising my rating from a 7 to an 8.
I introduced Meredith and Lyssa to the game and they really liked it (YEAH!).

Good theme , material of good quality.
The basic rules are too simple and too much random to make the game really interesting.  However the advanced rules are necessary and add a real strategy and tactical choices with the bidding phase to to be a 1st player; what makes it possible to eliminate a pawn from color that can be good for other players, to start to place a color of vikings on the wheel.   Need to choose carefully the island tile and the viking to optimize our placement and management of our vikings.

RATING: 7.5
Should be called Nordic Settlers, since the only pillaging in the game happens to you. But I really enjoy the use of the rondel for tile selection, and the placement too. Haven't graduated to the second advanced variant for bidding on the ordering of vikingeeples.

Gets more fun every time, and everyone we've played it with has liked it.  Very interesting tile-pricing system, unique placement mechanics, and the bonus tiles really add something once you've got the base game down.  Plays quick, so it doesn't feel heavy even though it's actually somewhat involved.

RATING: 10
Wow! I enjoyed this game more than any other after one play. It was simply awesome! The game is well-balanced, offers many paths to victory and has some really neat mechanics. I had VERY high expectations and it still somehow exceeded them. A solid 10!

Update 4/12/14: This is still my favorite game. I'm not saying it's the most innovative or impressive game design, but what it does, it does so well. Auction/bidding, worker placement, resource management and tile laying blend so well together in this gem. I am extremely pleased that Z-Man is reprinting this game. I don't know if there is anything to improve on, but I'm excited to buy a second copy.

Update 1/21/15: Still the best. Played with Erin last night (2 player) in just under an hour. It came down to money, and I won by one point--such a close game! She's certainly has some AP in this game, so with experienced players at that count, I think you can knock a game out in 45 minutes easily. We hadn't played in about 9 months, but didn't have any trouble remembering the rules. I can't say that about most games. Of the games I own, Vikings might have the best rule set to decision-making ratio. The saving grace, and what keeps it from bogging down, is that it's quite tactical, especially as you add players. I think players sense that and know that they just need to make the best possible decision on their current turn. I love how the board is small, but functional. I love the art, however simple it may be. The money in this game was nice before, with cardboard tokens of different colors and sizes. But, of course, I added metal barbarian coins to the game, which just makes it that much better and tactile. It's hard to have a favorite game. I love so many games. I think it's the perfect blend of mechanisms that allows this one to rise over the others.

Don't let the name Vikings fool you!  You will not be fighting.  You will not be conquering.  You will not, in fact, be doing anything you might expect from a game called Vikings.  You will essentially be creating a grid of little tiles to get points.  No, really.

The so-called Vikings theme is totally pasted on.  It has nothing to do with the mechanics of the game.  In the game you are buying tiles to put into your tableau.  Depending on how you arrange the tiles you will score more or less points.  It could have been called Spreadsheet: The Game.

Some people love Euros.  Great for them.  I really mean it.  However, the more I play the more I don't get the appeal.  Doing abstract things to generate points, with little to no theme, doesn't get me interested at all.

Let me preface this by saying we only played the base game, and only once at that.

I expected Vikings to be a middle weight game, but it played like a light filler. The luck factor seemed quite high, as the fixed turn order often dictated how many boats you'd have to take in a round. I'm not sure I like the idea of the gray meeples. It seems like it's too easy to move your other colors down later if you snag one of those. And since they are paired with boats often, the benefit of them balances with the detriment of having a boat. The blue meeples also seem quite swingy. In a 3-player game, each player will have perhaps 22 Vikings to feed at game end. If you have 4 blues, you lose 2 points. If you have 5 blues, you get 6 points. So that last blue is worth 8 points and each additional blue is worth 10 points. This seems to necessitate taking blues early, and since they are cheapest, early turns seem scripted. Given how well the game is rated, I must be missing some subtleties and buying more expensive tiles early must have merit.

I hear the advanced game has an auction for turn order and advanced tiles, so I will reserve final judgment until playing with those rules.

The more I play Vikings, the more I enjoy it. In it's base form there is enough randomness to make it enjoyable for a group spanning multiple skill levels, and the advanced game adds just enough to make the decisions fresh and interesting.

My sister introduction to the Eurogaming scene was through Vikings.  She liked it so much she asked it for her birthday.

One year later, she now has more choice in her library.

Hats off to Vikings!

Les Vikings les plus courageux ne craignent ni l'ennemi ni l'ami. Et donc, seul celui qui est fort, pourra s'imposer dans ce jeu. Du 8ème au 11ème siècle, les vikings ont tenu le monde en haleine. Ils ont quitté leur pays en tant que guerrier et explorateurs à la recherche de nouvelles terres, d'or et d'honneur. Pour cela, ils ont déférlés de leurs drakkars sur tout l'Europe.

Cette histoire sera donc au coeur de ce jeu avec la création de colonies, de villes et d'attaques d'autres villes. Sans oublier le commerce, la pêche ou l'artisanat !

Bref des choix cornéliens avec une version avancée pour les stratèges !

I wasn't sure I would like this game very much when we first played, but I was quickly won over.  The mechanics are very simple to understand, but there's a good amount of strategic depth to this game.  It plays completely differently with different numbers of players, and there's enough strategy and diversity of gameplay to excite me about exploring it more.  We haven't yet played with the "advanced" features that come with the base game, but I've greatly enjoyed the "basic" game thus far and can only look forward to the potential of adding more depth when (or even if) it ever starts to feel old.

My rating is based upon one playing and I would like to play the game a few more times before I settle on a more final rating.  After the first two rounds, I really liked the game.  However, as the game progressed, the randomness of the draw of the vikings and the tiles started to kill the game.  Moreover, depending where you were sitting, you could really get hosed.  

Update:  Have played the game several times now and I am really starting to enjoy it - bump to a 7.

I love tile-laying and this is among my favorites.  The decisions here are simple, yet very interesting and the overall feel of the game is just so clean and smooth.  This is among my favorite light strategy games and one I could easily suggest to almost anyone.  The rondel system, the pairing of tiles with vikings, and the changing value of these pairs just makes for such a wonderful core to what is otherwise a fairly simple tile optimization game.

Really nice tile laying game, where tiles and vikings are paired up at a rondell-type market, where the price drops as the cheapest tiles are claimed (which can only happen if the viking is the only one left of its colour or the player grabbing it cannot afford to buy any other tile).

You are building up a series of islands and inhabiting them with your vikings, to earn you money, points, to fight enemy ships and to feed the rest of your clan. If you play with the advanced rules you also have bonus tiles that can be claimed if you buy the most expensive tile on the market. The bonus tiles could help during the game or score you extra points at the end of the game.

Fairly easy to get into, and very enjoyable.

(Rating for basic game) Well, the mechanics are different, I'll give it that. But new mechanics does not an interesting game make (look Ma! Like Yoda I speak :)). The mechanics of the warriors/boats wis kind of hockey at best -- and you can end up with totally unwanted tiles just by being stuck at the wrong end of the turn order. More of a solitaire game than anything -- it's difficult to evaluate each player's positions and what tile/viking they might want, and so therefore best played as a tactical game, maximizing your own score without worrying too much on how the board position will change before your turn come again. Overall, a nice effort, I'd like to play again, but it feels more like a mix of good ideas with mixed results than a good game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A tough and somewhat unique buying/placement game that's much heavier than it looks.  The purhasing wheel is really what sets this apart from other games.  Players are tying to buy a good combination of viking & land tile without leading their opponents to purchases that would help them too much.  Certain purchases will make the costs for future purchases cheaper.  It can really be quite tactical and players will want to diversify and reduce pirate raids but it's not that easy for the right cost.  Overall the game can be somewhat tactical at times and it's very much a euro.  The viking theme works but don't expect any player vs. player fighting or pillaging.

"The game is pretty simple, and plays in a quick 45 minutes (or even faster). The decisions aren't always that interesting -- it's usually obvious which tile is the "best" on any given turn, though "best" for one player may not be "best" for another player. The BGG "2.45" weight is probably pretty accurate -- more decisions than Carcassonne, but not as much complexity as Suburbia."

RATING: 8.5
A game with very neat mechanics that require players to balance many factors against each other, yet still manages to have very simple decisions (i.e., on their turn literally the only thing a player can do is buy a viking and an island tile).

The game revolves around purchasing vikings and islands; you can put vikings on islands, which ends up netting you victory points.  The trouble comes, of course, in that you need specific island tiles with specific vikings on them, and they rarely are available at the ideal time.

The mechanism for purchasing island tiles and vikings is very cool: island tiles and vikings are semi-randomly paired up, and their price is determined by a wheel (which results in changing prices depending on what people have purchased).  I find the balancing of needs to be difficult, and was horribly beaten in my first two games.

The mechanics are very cool, and the game length is short enough to allow it to fit nicely into a long series of gaming.

Ok, so an admittedly novel mish-mash of mechanics. Felt pretty abstract, and between the multiple layers of randomness (due to meeple and tile draws) and the arcane scoring system, I came out on top by about 20 VP, with no real idea how I did so. So I was entertained for the hour it took to play, but don't ever see owning this one.

The Progress variant of the game solves lots of problems and makes it brilliant with four players, introduces more strategy into the game as well, many paths to victory. A great game especially played two or three times in an session.

Possibly an alternative to Carcassonne, but it's not worth paying twice as much for it. There's a little more depth to this one I suppose, but the thin theme limited my interest and the game can lag at times even though it's just an hour.

Vikings is an interesting multi-dimensional set-collecting & drafting game.  I love the look & feel of the game - it has a great atmosphere.  The gameplay is a bit muted, but it is curious that each game presents a different feel: if many enemy ships come out early, the game can feel tense and frustrating.  Other times, when the enemy ships don't come out during the first few rounds, things feel very peaceful and relaxed. 

The theme isn't that bad, I just say: "The Vikings in this game are brethren of Leif Erikson - exploring and colonizing the coast of Vinland."

Really cool light to mid Euro. Many mechanics have been seen before but they are blended in with a few new ideas to create a game that throws up interesting decisions each turn.

The rondel element used to collect islands and vikings is interesting and the various scoring rounds and end game scoring bonuses allow players to go after numerous objectives. 

A must buy for fans of the light/mid euro genre.

RATING: 7
Each player is attempting to build up their viking empire. There are 6 turns in the game. Each turn, there are 12 vikings/ships and 12 lands for purchase. The 12 vikings are drawn at random from a bag, while the land is also randomly drawn. The unique mechanism in this game is that purchases are done on a wheel,allowing for fluctuating purchases depending what is available. Players score for different types of vikings: fisherman, goldsmiths, scouts, nobles and warriors. Players also score for completed islands. 

This is a fun fast paced game. The wheel mechanism is a fairly new mechanism and works here. There are different strategies to try, such as concentrating on nobles, goldsmiths or fisherman. What does bother me a bit is that with 6 rounds, and with 4 players, not everyone will get a chance to go first. So potentially you lose out on a fisherman because of turn order. Still, it's fun to play, and there are some things beyond your control such as when you are getting your last tile, you may not have much  of a choice or decision.

I understand that the theme is not really an integral part of this game, but the overall experience of the first play was still quite satisfying for me. I dived into the advanced game right away, after reading what others have said here - well worth it, I think. The market is a really interesting idea, and placing island tiles also provides enough fun as a sub-system.

My rating is based on one playing of the basic game, so it is subject to change once I get to try the advanced version. The wheel was a cool idea, but in the game I played (and in most games based on what I heard from other players) all were at the mercy of the draw of the tiles. Once in a great while there was a small decision to be made, but in general, the game played itself.

RATING: 7
Quite an interesting mix of mechanics in this game.  There are different colored Vikings that provide you with different bonuses that you choose in an interesting way.  You cannot take the cheapest Viking of one color unless it is the last one, so you are constantly worried about what you are leaving your opponents.  

After selecting a Viking he needs to be placed on the islands that you also have selected earlier in the round.  It is important how you place your Vikings because depending on what is in front or behind your Viking he scores differently.  If you do not have a properly placed land mass, it is possible you will not be able to place that Viking where you wanted.

The game is very interesting and every game has me thinking pretty deeply, especially about what you are leaving your opponents.

About the basic game: I liked the game. You can get quite (un)lucky with the auctioning wheel depending how occupations are divided but most of the time it feels you can make meaningful decisions and control your game. Rules are clear and playing is straight forward. 

About advanced game: You really should play the advanced game if you're playing with other than beginners. Starting players auctions make it possible to control a bit more of your fate. Advanced game is quite a bit more nasty as you can normally only take one person with a boatsman onto your tiles. I definitely like game more with these set of rules. 

Game works with 2-4 players equally well. With less players in the game you gain more tiles during the game and game is more forgiving. When playing with 4 players it can get quite nasty as you're all competing for same resources more. Either way it's a very good game.

Vikings gives a bit of a twist to the usual ingredients of German family games of the fleshier kind - literally! Its most distinctive feature is a wheel indicating the prices of the usual drafted goods (here it's pairs of tiles and figures in any combination of colours and shapes, respectively); when the pair for free is drafted the wheel turns until there is a new one and the prices of all pairs sink accordingly.

Otherwise Vikings still manages to feel both fresh and solid without being necessarily heavy - as with other games of its kind all the interaction lies in drafting properly, but since players still have to arrange the chosen tiles and figures in a single pattern and get enough points and money to keep going, the decisions to take are seldom trivial.

Simpatico e sottovalutato gioco dove ha un peso importante la fortuna ma non manca un po' di strategia e le dinamiche e le meccaniche sono abbastanza originali. Trovo che la conquista di omini gialli nei primi turni sia fondamentale e questo spesso è in balia del caso ma trattandosi di un gioco semplice e veloce questo rimane un dettaglio. Gioco promosso a pieni voti che ogni tanto rigioco volentieri.

[b]Vikings[/b] was reacquired* 11/14/15 then sold via auction 4/8//16. 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I've enjoyed quite a few Kramer/Kiesling designs and Kiesling knocked this one out of the park on his own. I enjoyed the game even more once we added the expansion/bonus tiles. It took a game that could begin to feel a bit samey in terms of strategies and really opened things up. You never know which bonus opportunities will come up when so a lot of times those first few buildings can really help give you a focus. Money also becomes a very viable way to score a bunch of points if you manage to get those multipliers. 

I would definitely recommend checking out Vikings, it plays well with 2, makes a great next step family game and with the inclusion of the expansion tiles (which come in the box) offers a deeper game play experience and on top of that it wraps up in 60 minutes or less.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Plays great with 2 and is a great family game.
- Tile laying: one of my favorite mechanics in games especially when it is not the [i]only[/i] mechanic.
- The market wheel: Innovative mechanic that determines how much a certain tile/veeple set is going to cost. 
[i]This creates a lot of tense moments when you try to determine whether you can wait one more round to get the tile/veeple you need for a lower price.[/i]
- Bonus tiles add more strategy to the game without adding a lot of new rules or added complexity.[/i]

Es un euro simple, con draft de tiles con workers que colocás en tu tablero de forma de ir armando islas y poblándolas. Hacía rato que no lo jugaba, pero siempre estoy dispuesto a encarar una partida. Es corto, poco demandante, pero te da varias opciones que explorar. Creo que me gusta más con tres jugadores, o dos, cuatro drafteando se vuelve demasiado táctico. Tema? bien, gracias...

This game really feels like a sea faring carcassonne in a way, but with new point collecting strategies! This game is great! A nice medium weight game you can play on a week night without being overwhelmed. Lay out the tiles around the wheel and set the vikings in color order around the tiles. Each colored viking offers you different perks, gold, protection, food, etc. Each tile can be connected to other tiles to create a sea of islands. Try to keep your vikings on the islands or move them all by using the boatmen!

Topshelf lightweight Euro, full of hard choices and tradeoffs with every turn. The turning price wheel is a wonderful addition to the gaming scene. Each turn you need to assess who wants the remaining tiles and whether the tiles you really want will still be there by your next turn or not, and that continual assessment drives the game along. There's also a tradeoff in going for money (invest in your engine) or secure long term VP's. A whole bunch of rich gaming decisions in a shortish but complete and satisfactory timeframe.

RATING: 6
Definitely an interesting game, where you must choose your tile/veeple pair vs. cost, plus what it will leave for your opponent, plus how to construct your islands. The rules are probably a 2.5, and depth of play makes it a bit heavier. It is more tactical than strategic, as you basically have to do the best you can with the tiles/veeples available.

Although you don't have too many decisions, there could be some AP as you try to think multiple moves ahead, including blocking your opponent(s). Definitely some opportunities for screwage, although not too nasty. However, it is a BRUTAL competition for scarce resources, like dogs fighting in an alley over food scraps. There are a couple opportunities each game to grab something you don't need just to deny your opponent.

I don't really want to play again because it's kind of stressful for me. I prefer games with more indirect interaction. As a result, even though it is a very well-designed game, I'm dropping my rating from 7 to 6.

It's no doubt a euro spreadsheet game and it has absolutely nothing to do with Vikings.  But at least the game has enough interesting things to offer and it is fun to play.  There is some room for vicious play on the rondel.  And the mainland/island (i.e. spreadsheet) you build throughout the game is fun in a puzzly way.  If you like euros, this is a good game.  If you are looking for Viking adventures, you won't find it here.

Another game that I researched to find a game that plays well with more than 2 players, but you don't feel like youre not getting the full deal if you only play with 2.

Having now played 13 times (all 2 player) I think its a great games. I love the auction mechanism, whereby the draw of the tiles and vikings in conjunction gives every round its own unique flavour.

We played the basic game about 10 times before moving on to the more advanced game (which is included in the box, thats a plus), I think that was about right it makes you appreciate the subtle differences the extra tiles give the game.

Need to try and play with more players. I think the fact that the game is called Vikings but there is no combat, puts some people off.

A fresh feeling euro. This combines a set collection game, a tile placement game, and a dutch auction game.  It is all wrapped up in the curious puzzle of a pricing rondel. It finishes with a Knizia-like scoring system.

First off, don't be fooled into thinking this is a game about Vikings, it's actually an economics game.  The game has an interesting resource drafting mechanic, which doesn't feel too constraining, but I wonder how much trying to figure out what other people will do helps.  I'd like to try some more of the advanced rules, to spice things up a bit.

It would rate higher, however I have issues with four players, meaning two players only get to start one round each.

RATING: 9
Very inventive and original mechanics. Tile placement, strategic and tactical considerations, difficult to play well in the first few tries but quick and interesting.

Very strong left/right player bindings and the price wheel is pure genius.

The basic game is a strong 8. The variant using the advanced tiles, but without the auctions is a very solid 9.

I suspect that both versions work better with 2 or 3 players, than with the full compliment of 4.

Never tried the auction, but I'm not too enthusiastic about it.

Beautiful game art. I only need more experience.
This game has elements which can be analyzed but imho in takes just far too long to analyze them. And if you don't analyze the alternatives... you will fall down rather easily.

Edit: Second game went well. I got the idea - only the strategies were left alone. So many subtle ways to hurt another player... Rating from 6 to 7 for now.

Pretty fun light/mid-weight Euro. The coolest part of the game is the auction/rondel/price wheel feature, which introduces some interesting timing and priority considerations to tile/viking selection. Playing with the advanced tiles is *much* more fun. Pretty beginner accessible, even with the advanced tiles.

Rating aftr 2 plays of 2 player basic game. Very pretty board and components with fairly easy to learn rules although the final scoring round is a bit complicated. Don't forget about fishermen! I was 12 points in the lead by the end but only had 3 fishermen for 35 vikings thus I lost 20 points at the very last which made my girlfriend point and laugh.

A thoughtful experience, and it times itself beautifully at about 45-60 minutes.  Lots of interesting decisions, and usually winds up being a tense nail-biter.  The theme question is moot: vikings did more than pillage.  So long as you can judge the game apart from "VIKINGS!", you'll be fine.  A  cool, thoughtful number.

My wife really liked this neat game. Not sure how to classify it, but it is mostly run on an auction/selection mechanism. It is simple and works well. The theme feels a bit pasted on, but the art looks great and works well. It takes little time to setup and play a game, which also make it a very appealing game.

A new twist on a bidding game.  I'm usually tired of bidding games, but this one is fun and packs alot of action into a short amount of time.  Players bid for vikings/tiles using a unique wheel mechanic that changes the prices of the goods.  Players then place the vikings/tiles in front of them (similar to Carcassone) to optimize their gold and points.  Lots of agonizing decisions.  I reckon it's best with 3.

Great, original little game, unlike anything else I've played. There's enough strategy, looking ahead and watching your opponents to keep your decisions interesting in what is otherwise a simple and light game. The rules for tiles distribution make for changing and fresh situations. Gameplay is reactive for a large part, though; you have to make the most of the hand you're dealt (not literally).

Might be too light (too little control) for gamers, and too many rules (each different colored viking scores differently, and how and when you can bid and place isn't superintuitive) for non-gamers, but otherwise a very solid game.

Though I infrequently play with gaming groups I know this design has been getting a lot of play, and eventually I managed to give Vikings a go. I can see why it is so popular: its solitaire Carcassonne with some strategy. 

The money wheel provides some look ahead and interesting consequences when buying plots of land and Vikings; one consequence of buying pricey real estate is a rule warping power tile. Plots are placed in your own yard ala Carc with a puzzle feel like Princes of Florence, though thankfully for some not so spatial. Vikings must be placed with the plot or later elsewhere in your area "paratrooper" style. 

So another vp/money generating engine with many (variable) avenues to advance, but what I like about this design is that it seems that the engine block is made of glass (and I don't feel the need to read a manual as the icons are almost self explanatory): i.e. I can SEE what is happening that is going to be productive, I know I need to get 5 multi coloured Vikings in a row to maximise, but it ain't going to happen so easily. 

Sadly, when playing Vikings, Led Zep's "Immigrant Song" doesn't readily come to mind (like it does when playing Fire and Axe); in fact the meeples make me think of Jamiroquai.

[floatleft][ImageID=516172][/floatleft]After playing Vikings on brettspielwelt and finally playing in person, I like this game quite a bit.

In spite of the lightweight nature of this game it is still awesome.

This game plays well. You get this tile + meeple selection system similar to Seeland. Then you place the tile + meeple in a row on your board in a way similar to Hawaii. Sometimes you are forced to take ship tiles, which hurt your column depending on the color of the ship and if you have a protection meeple there or not. Really, the game is fine, it just isn't different enough from other games I own that I like more. The way the meeples are randomly pulled from the bag can sometimes be frustrating. It's not uncommon to be ruined by luck of the draw here, and the game doesn't provide any catch-up ability.

Pretty neat game and if I didn't own/love Castles of Burgundy, it would probably get a higher rating. This game gives me a very similar feel to CoB, so much in fact that I wouldn't see myself being in the mood for this but not choosing CoB instead. Fight your opponents for the common tiles, and find a way to place them in your personal space for maximum points.

Don't love it enough to want to buy it for the reason mentioned above, but would definitely enjoy playing it again!

Should be called Norse Accountants instead of Vikings: Did not find the game appealing.
It is a solitaire optimization game using a Carcassone like placement of selected tiles with the associated meeples. It is not a complicated game. It gives the appearance of strategic depth as you try to optimize your both your meeple and tile placement. 
However, this is illusory. With the tile and meeple draw there is no resource control and extremely little planning you can do. The wheel mechanic looks nice but provides no real competition for tiles except every now and then jumping ahead for key component. 
I found reading the tiles (you have to look at the waves) and the island grouping layouts to be more troublesome than it was worth. 
The final scoring appears to be out of balance to what you score in the intermediate rounds. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Good game but not exceptional. The wheel to aquire the islands and drakkars is particularly clever. The main point about that game is that the final scoring is so powerfull that the small and large scoring seem's useless during the game. You have also a hard time to know your real standing during the game making it hard to build youself a game strategy.

Bon jeu mais pas exceptionnel. La roue pour aquérir les iles et vikings est particulièrement intéressante. Le point principale du jeu est que la phase de décompte finale est tellement puissante qu'elle semble rendre les petits et grands décomptes lors de la partie sans intéret. Il est difficile également de déterminer son classement durant la partie ce qui rend l'élaboration d'une stratégie plus difficile.

Yet another Euro with a weak theme, not much player interaction, complex scoring to ensure a "balanced" game and uncreative strategies, and emphasis on quick tactical decisions over long-term planning.

It has the feel of Alhambra/Palazzo -- you draft tiles, pay for them, then add those tiles to your personal display and arrange in such a way to maximize VP (and in this game) income.

Despite its uninspiring nature, it does play quickly, Unlike Alhambra, which I cannot tolerate, you're never left in a situation in which you are totally screwed; the frustration factor is much, much lower.

The theme has nothing to do with the game. Actually, it would probably make sense if this were a city building game. The supply-demand mechanism I could live with theme-wise. I honestly believe any attempt to implement a theme with this game is hopeless. The problem is what you're trying to build with the tiles: You're trying to arrange tiles and meeples on a grid so that they score horizontally and vertically. Really, the only thing that could be organized like that in the real world is an Excel spreadsheet. Even cities don't operate in rowas and columns; they tend to grow and flourish by clumps of irregular sized neighbourhoods. Simply look at some of the island/viking meeple pictures here; could you imagine a viking colony as orderly and organized as that? Different types of vikings all in neat rows?

It seems like the best strategy is to ensure you have a stable income, then go after points. This is similar to many games, but in this case, it's actually easy to secure a stable income. After that, you simply have to pay attention to what tiles and vikings your opponents want and try to take them before they do, But most tiles can be used effectively anyway. These two things -- income generation and a surplus of pretty good tiles undoubtedly reduce the frustration factor (as in Alhambra) but dramatically reduce the tension.

Component Quality:
Very good. The Viking meeples are tough and nice to look at, while the tiles are thick and can handle a good deal of shuffling. The spinner will probably receive the most wear from play, but it resists even the most...enthusiastic of gamers.

Gameplay:
Love the auction and tile-placement. Perfect length. One of the few games I own that's great with 3 players. The limit on black warrior pieces seems to make the 4-player game particularly rough on one player, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just means players have to be extra careful about their choices.

The advanced tiles and auction variants are interesting. These variants change the strategy quite a bit, but overall make the auction system much tighter.

A very interesting and fun design. Not much player interaction (except in the two-player game, where it is often worthwhile to deny a good opportunity to your opponent) but plenty of difficult, interesting decisions. After a dozen plays, I raised my rating of this delightful and innovative game.

A very interesting game with unique mechanics. It has an auction element (advance game) to it along with strategic tile placement to maximize points. Great player interaction as well as you try to anticipate what each other might do. 

Different vikings with varying advantages and land tiles are placed around a wheel. The wheel determines how much things cost and is continually changing. One must figure out how to manipulate the wheel to acquire the land tile and viking of their choice and block others from getting their choice. The 2 and 3 player games are great. Haven't tried with 4.

A solid fun game that plays in about 45 minutes once experienced.

I was pleasantly surprised at the tension this game provided with 4 players around the table.

I am not fond of the 2 player unrestricted supply though, it was an odd choice to publish the game without adapted rules for that player count - I guess I'll have to make my own, or leave this game on the shelf when I can't get more players involved. As such, rating for 2p would be a 6 for base game, 7 with advanced rules.

Vikings is a fun game to play. The two main elements to this game- tiles and vikings- are randomly introduced. While this is mostly manageable and can be controlled a bit by planning ahead, smartly playing the market and anticipating your opponents actions- the high level of randomness can make for some very skewed advantages from nothing more than player position at the time of the draw. A player can get well behind early if there aren't any island start tiles available to them or gold vikings to increase income.

Clever mechanisms and cool bits!  The bonus tiles for the goldsmiths seem unbalanced.  And, by Odin's bones, don't run too low on money!  Those warriors are SO important to get.  I'm interested in getting another stab at this one soon.  Best game of the evening.  Rating went up from 7 to 8 after another play.  Very solid game.  After more playing, I prefer it with three.  Even with four, I thought I lost more control than I like.

After playing the advanced game, I'm left scratching my head a bit.  The special tiles are very cool and give a great tension between buying on the cheap or jumping up to take the highest packet.  But all the auction at the beginning and arranging of the  figures...that seemed like a lot of time lost for very little extra control.  If the winner got to arrange ALL the colors, or got to place on either the start or end of the queue, I could see it mattering.  As it is, I thought it was a "clunk" that was out of place in an otherwise fairly elegant game.  In future, I will lobby for using the special tiles (and, I guess, using the harsher boatmen rule) but skipping the auction bit.

Lot's of fun. The rondel bidding mechanic is interesting and the tile placement/meeple placement is very interesting. Great for 2p.  This is a game my wife and I played a low before we started logging plays, so it looks like a sad number of plays compared to the actual number. ;)

2008-12-17: First game, 2-player.  Soldiers and Gold are important!  Second game: Fish are also important. :)

2008-11-30: Won as prize at [[Pionek]] for being 1st place in logical games tournament.

2010: got reinterested in it, and the advanced rules add value.

Setup and teardown is a bit too fiddly, but overall a good game.

The mechanic, a rotating rondel, for purchasing a pair of tiles and vikings gives this game an elegant system for tile placement. I find the decision making in this game to be rather enjoyable, and the fact that 2 players can complete a game in 20-30 minutes makes it that much better.

--July2007-- Interesting constrained-tile-laying game with interaction by auction.  Not much blood, though; these Vikings are pretty peaceable, all things considered.  So: perhaps not so much theme, but still quite amusing.
--June2009-- Rating up to 7; there's more to consider than I'd originally thought.
--Apr2010-- Again up to 7.3; this time it's partially the dynamic range expansion of using the full 1-10 rating range.  And some, too, as the result of being exposed to the Progress Version - which is pretty nice.
--Jan2017-- Traded away.  With a tiny bit of regret: the game is cute.  But not nearly enough to demand I own a copy.

Some nice ideas, but not enough to make it stand out from the crowd. And the viking theme is painfully weak. I'd rather play Carcassonne instead...

Update: played again after a long time, because a friend got this from the bargain bin. Final verdict: boring game for bookkeepers build around a complicated scoring mechanism and gimmicky tile selection with an attached theme.

The meeples and tiles remind me of Carcarssone. Viking game is usually about raiding, reaving and raping. But this one, is a building and fishing game! You lead your people to develop your village and block the viking pirates from attacking. The combo draft system is intriguing. But still, it's not a game about true Viking...

---

Wikinger, c'est un matos joli, un thème un peu plaqué mais pourquoi pas, plein de règles dans tous les sens (et des dizaines de sources de points de victoire), pour un résultat plutôt confus, peu interactif, hasardeux et au final peu emballant. Il me fait vraiment l'impression d'un énième jeu « à l'allemande », dans le sens le plus classique du terme.

Le coup de la roue est pas mal trouvé, ça donne une sorte d'intermédiaire entre le jeu d'enchères et le blocage à la [gameid=9217]. Ça me fait aussi un peu penser au paiement des architectes aux [gameid=24480]. Malheureusement, l'idée aurait gagné à être enrobée dans un jeu un peu plus fun.

Bref, pas un jeu mauvais, mais un jeu "correct" et tout à fait dispensable. À envisager si vous avez déjà épuisé les [gameid=24480], [gameid=25554], [gameid=9217], [gameid=481], [gameid=2476], [gameid=13642]... et la centaine d'autres bons jeux « allemands tendance poids moyen » qui existent sur le marché.

(PS. : je n'y ai joué qu'à quatre joueurs, et il semblerait que le jeu soit plus intéressant à deux ou trois.)

Vikings is strategic tile-based game where players spend gold to buy both a viking and an island tile, and place them in their tableau to their best advantage.  The game board includes a score track, a round track, and the payment wheel; the payment wheel is one of the central mechanics of the game.  The wheel has 12 slots, numbered 0 - 11, each corresponding with a location where a tile and viking combo will rest.  The number of the slot determines the cost for that set.  There are two types of tiles in the game, islands and ships, and six different types of vikings.  Each player also receives a player base.  The game plays over 6 rounds, then a final scoring round occurs and the victor is determined.

When the game is setup all the tiles are shuffled then arranged into stacks of 12 tiles, then placed on the round track.  At the beginning of each round the next tile stack is removed from the round track and distributed around the payment wheel.   Islands are start at 0 and work up to 11 while ships start at 11 and work down to 0.  Finally 12 vikings are chosen from a cloth bag and arranged on the offered tiles, always in the same color order.  Players take turns buying the tiles until there are no titles left to purchase.  A player must buy a tile, and may buy any tile he can afford, the only exception being the tile priced at 0, which can only be purchased when no other vikings of the same color are available, or the player cannot afford any of the offered tiles.  When the tile at 0 is purchased the wheel is rotated clockwise until another tile is worth 0.  When a tile is purchased it is immediately placed in the player's play area; however, the tile must be orthogonally adjacent to another tile or the the player base.  Any island tiles must be played correctly orientated, and the tile's edges must match those it is adjacent to (water to water and land to land), otherwise the tile is discarded from play.  All ship tiles are played in the first row of the player's tableau.

Each viking color corresponds to a particular fashion of scoring in the game, though wile every tile will be played, not every viking will come into play.  Each row in the player's tableau corresponds to one of the vikings, and if an island is placed in the same row as the viking that came with the tile, then the viking can be placed on the tile just played, otherwise he's set on the player's base.  Vikings score when they are on islands, with the only exception being the boatsmen, who score vikings on the base.

The game has a fascinating depth of strategy, as players not only must choose which tiles they want, weighed against which vikings they want, they must also manage the payment wheel. Careful selection of the tile/viking combo will reward the player, and skillful management of the payment wheel can force an opponent to take a disadvantageous tile/viking set.  Vikings is a marvelous game of strategy and dynamics.

Nice balance. Love the auction wheel mechanic. Strikes me unique. Fun. Plays fast. I expect this game will become one of my favourites I'll be happy to bring to the table again and again. For good balance I prefer with three though, as there's six turns.

-----

Update: After more than a hundred plays I do feel that the only particular strike against this game is the value of oversupply of fishermen. The amount of fishermen a player can pick up is dictated by the bag draw, and players almost always pick up every fisherman they can because the value is too high. Oversupply value should be halved to one instead of two points and it would still be worth picking up every one you can get your hands on.

Abstract and dry game with the theme not only pasted, put picked wrong.  When I play a game call [i]Vikings[/i] I'd like to rape some women, sack some goods, burn some towns, profanate some bodies, kill some guys, enslave some children, and then drink all night until fall down, or to be rescued by the Valkyries from the battle field and taken to Valhalla instead... but not to get tiles in order to form islands with some guys hanging around.  It can be seen as a [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/555]Princes of Florence[/url][/i] light, but with much more interaction.  In fact, I'd play [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/27173]Vikings[/url][/i] rather than [i]Princes of Florence[/i], but that isn't much to say.

I like the mechanisms in the game pretty well. The only things I don't like are that the end is a bit anticlimactic - there's no story arc, you just do the same thing over and over a few times and then you're done, count up the score. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but in this game it felt like the game was cut short.

RATING: 6
In the family of games where you draft tiles and arrange them on your mat, Vikings is right up there with Factory Fun and Thurn and Taxis. I am impressed with the strong, elegant puzzle feel that it exudes simply from square tiles and colored meeples (unlike the complete travesty that is Maori).

The supply track adjustment for tile/meeple combo is a little weird (the supply track itself and the rules for placing combos works well), and seems like an ill-fitting way to fit in the coolness of rotating the wheel, at the cost of introducing some weird gameplay. Just seems like you can really game it (I take this, so you have to take that, so I get to take this), especially in 2-player. I guess that just means money is a lot more important with 2 players. Still, I think a gentler sliding scale (move combos down the scale to replace ones that were drafted) would have fitted better.

This game is the poster child for Euros with an awesome-sounding name and box cover, then you play the game and find the theme is a disappointment. Thought you were going to raid islands and sail the high seas? Sucka, go sit in the corner and work on your puzzle.

Only played as a two player game so far, and was very enjoyable at that count.

Advanced rules minus the auctions seems to provide a good balance of tactical play and approachable mechanisms.

Taking into account all of the end-game scoring bonuses the first couple times through is a bit challenging. The bosun majority score seems rather large to me, but I'm sure that more plays will provide insight into how these bonuses are balanced &/or achieved.

I really enjoy several aspects of this design including the pricing wheel and the interdependence of the tiles and meeples on the island grid when calculating scores, viking ship attacks, etc.

Vikings -- Played three- and four-player.  Played standard version and liked it [b]very[/b] much.  Fishermen were painfully important in our three-player standard session.  After playing the full Progress version, I'm interested in playing with only [i]some[/i] elements of the Progress version.  For example, including auctions, but excluding special tiles.  Or maybe having the start player eliminate one of 13 vikings, but arranging the vikings in standard order.  There are lots of possibilities, and I'm looking forward to trying several.  The game plays relatively quickly for its weight, and I enjoy the sense of progress even if I don't score well.

Pro-tip: Don't ever put yourself in a position where you can only place one type of island tile. I liked this game much more after I realized that was super dumb. The way you gain Vikings/islands tiles via the pricing wheel is not something I had seen before, and I like how it works. Just don't fool yourself into thinking this game actually has anything to do with Vikings. It's a medium weight Euro with a pasted on Vikings theme.

RATING: 7.5
I have to say that the most exciting thing about the game is that there is an innovative new market system.  The rest of the game is rather ok.  After digesting the rules I was questioning whether it was going to work or not, but it is a successful design.

Mostly you are optimizing your points and giving yourself options for placement in the future.  Just as with many other Euros most of the "interaction" here is in drafting items you can use that other players need.  Unlike something like St. Petersburg, the reprocusions are more dramatic and you must constantly balance what will be left for you if you screw someone else.  

What makes the game worthwhile is that each of the drafts have two different features, the job of the viking and the land tile.  There are times where it is absolutely worth taking a tile when you don't want the man, especially when it will allow for more options later in the round.  Knowing when you are going to get free guys/tiles and preparing for their placement is essential in this game as the money is so tight.  There is also a satisfaction in how you build your tiles.

The market has the potential to be very harsh and if you pass up opportunities you may end up getting humped into an untenable position.  Still though, it is engaging, and surprisingly more interactive that is has rights to be.

UPDATE: The game is much improved by the advanced game.  The decisions are more difficult and the options to get the special tile by buying the most expensive item makes for more play options, and makes for more decision making.

Still, it can be a harsh game.  If things go wrong for you, it is tough to get back in.

UPDATE: This game gets better with more plays.  I highly recommend ONLY playing this with the advanced rules.

Rating after only one play.  Wow, this is a weird game.  I liked it a lot, but it is strange.  The whole Island mechanic, where the different types of vikings are in different rows, is counter intuitive to the theme and hard to explain, and the scoring is simply bizarre.  But the wheel is just incredibly cool.  My rating is liable to drop with more plays, but at first glance I was very intrigued.

Great with 2-4 players and awesome production.  I really enjoy the different decisions you have to make between the building of the islands and where/when you place your vikings -- awesome to have these things that have to work together for victory.  Fun, light euro that I think I'll always enjoy!  *Update* - Moved into the 9 territory after a quick, awesome play over Thanksgiving in which all four players knew how to play.  The game took less than 45  minutes.

After 3 plays I like this game very much. I like it more with 3 players than 4p, which is unsual. Theme is very artificial. However, in my last game I felt as though I had no control. I'm leaning towards thinking last player is at a disadvantage.

I've played a ton of this game online, not as much in-person.  The "initial high" I've had with this game is starting to wear off.  I've realized that the game becomes somewhat formulaic after a while, and it does boil down to more of a puzzle to solve.

I like that it plays in roughly the same amount of time regardless of player count.  I think 3 is the sweet spot.

Still need to try the advanced rules.

RATING: 6
A great puzzle-like tile laying game. I love that there are lots and lots of ways to score victory points, this makes for a game where you have to pay attention to a lot of different aspects. This is the biggest set-back as well: it's not the easiest game to teach and the first few plays you're a bit lost. After the initial bump, though, this is a great tactical game in a very short time frame. A favorite as a 2-player game!
I finally tried the advanced rules, which reallu added more and more layers to an already very layered scoring. Money gets even tighter and there's more room for specialization. The fact a tile is needed for the effective use of your boatsmen, makes efficient tile-laying an absolute must.

Traded it for Granada.

RATING: 9.5
Great combination of tile-placement and pseudo-auction; an interesting spin on some tried-and-true mechanics.  There's more here than initially meets the eye, which is always an indication of a quality ruleset.

UPDATE: Had another enjoyable play and considered moving up the rating but don't think there's enough decisions in this one to move it up any.

UPDATE #2:  I really don't know what I was talking about... marching this one up a little bit more.

UPDATE #3:  The auction variant (and expert game) are a must - it just adds to the delicious decisions!

It seemed that a lot hinged upon what vikings came out when.  Players, simply because of where they sat, could find themselves denied of important things because of the constraining rules on the purchase of Vikings.  The wheel is a clever way to quickly change prices.  The islands closing and opening seemed to be a lot of mechanics for something that really got in the way more than was fun.

RATING: 7
This is supposedly about Vikings, but really it's a pretty abstract tile laying game with an interesting market mechanism (the spinny wheel thing!).  It's another one of those medium-light weight games that plays in around an hour (or less?). It's fun, but not necessarily something I need to have. Probably too chaotic with many players -- affected too much by turn order and the random tile draw. But quite enjoyable with 2 or 3 (although the 2er is a very different game!). Still, it's quick enough and fun enough to be worth a play now and again.

One of the most promising new games I have played in quite some time.  The choices are all meaningful and interesting and all the game elements are interrelated in a tightly woven design.  There appear to be many different strategies that could work here.  I can easily see my rating increasing upon further playings, with an outside chance to go all the way to ten.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is one of those games where I completely respect its design and consider it a great game and can see why many people love it...while also not being one of those people.  It's just simply not for me or my taste of game although because it is so good of a game I wouldn't hate myself for playing it.

The game is a simple drafting and tile-placement affair.  The Vikings theme is completely inconsequential, this is a very abstract game (which should fill you in on why I don't care for it since I'm not a fan of most abstract titles).  Each round several tiles depicting one of the three pieces of an island (left, middle, right) or a boat are placed randomly around a rondel.  On these islands are randomly placed vikings of several different colors.  The rondel shows increasing prices for drafting both the tile/viking pairs.  When the front of the rondel is empty the rondel rotates lowering the prices of the remaining slots.

After drafting these tile/viking pairs you place the tile along your player board building islands and placing vikings in the correctly colored rows which score you points or earn you money in different ways during the scoring rounds.  The actual game comes in which pairs you draft and where you place them along your player board since island pieces can only go where they fit and vikings only stick around on islands when they are placed in the correct rows.

Like I said, this is very well designed.  It plays very smoothly and is also accessible and reasonably short even at max player count.  But even as a filler it's just not something that appeals to me.  For me, after one play I've seen everything this game has to offer.  The decisions came easily to me and I didn't feel like there were many interesting decisions to be made from round to round.  There wasn't enough tension in the competition for tiles and without that there is certainly no theme or engaging gameplay to keep me interested.  It is just kind of bland...again, for me.

This is a tile placing game where the tile only activates if the appropriate colored meeple is place on it. The wheel that determines the prices for the tile-meeples make for some interesting choices. For example, do you pick a middle island with a green meeple for 4 coins or an end island with a black meeple for 10 coins; a green meeple with an end island doesn't exist this round even though that is what you really need. While this is unique, it is not enough to request additional plays.

A very agreeable game that is pretty simple, but als rather clever. I haven't played the advanced rules yets, but even the base version is nice enough. In a certain way, it reminds me of St. Petersburg, but this offer much more room for decision making and is much less a math exercise. Plays in less than 45 minutes with 4 and is also excellent with two. Recommended.

+ The highly strategic pricing wheel!
+ Progress version, especially the new tiles (though I suck at it)
+ The theme is pasted on, but the art and viking meeples makes you forget it
+ Different game depending on the number of players
+ Great randomizer with the tiles and vikings draw
DISLIKE
- No equal number of round during 4 player games makes it flawed
- Changing VP into cash; if you don't have the cash, it should be too bad for you
VERDICT
Plays quick, lots of strategy, different paths to victory, and a different game every time.
This is one of the best under 1 hour 3 player game.
When you are familiar with the base game, play the progress version to completely renew the game.
My ultimate 3 players 1-hour game!

Comments for Vikings with special tiles, no bidding, mostly 2 p :

Vikings is a tough one.  I did not like it at first and could not see the strategy.  I think I took it as a lighter-than-it-is family game.  Which it is not.  There is quite a bit of forward planning and spatial organization necessary for doing well. There are plenty of ways to grab little bits of points here and there, not including the nice end game bonuses.  

It's one game where I feel a sense of dread come over me mid-game when I know I have not done well.  It can be surprising, though, to find I was within 1-3 points of winning. Which means it is somewhat difficult to track your standing.  That's not a bad thing just intriguing.

Plays quickly and the auction wheel is a great innovation. After a 2-3 plays, I can't help feel the final scoring of absolutely everything (money, islands, boatmen etc etc) - adds a fair bit of randomness into the game.  Every game I have played has had less that 5VP separating the players.

After 8 plays I really enjoy this game, light but a lot going on.

Interesting buying mechanic (but not economic - if you have only one meeple in a colour it is cheap, but it should be expensive). You should look how the price change after your choice, mabe you buy cheap, but give the next player something good for free.

Iteresting tile placement. You must look at the tiles (begin, middle and end of a island) and look at the colurs of the meeple. The ships give much points, but must be defended and all meeple must be feeded at the end of the game.

The game is very fast, but with 4 players and with the basic verson it seems very random.

At first you might think you'd have too little interaction. But as players get more experienced competition for the tiles gets more interesting

I found this to be interesting, but choices were often fairly limited in our initial four-player game, with much-needed roles gone from the board before some players even began their turns. Others report this improves as a three-player game, and I'm looking forward to trying it out that way. Also interested in seeing whether the variant/advanced rules improve control and choices. The mechanics are pretty novel, although the theme doesn't mesh perfectly with the design. Definitely offbeat and different enough to stand out from the crowd, even if, as I suspect, it never rises above being merely a good game. Update: Vikings improves as a three-player game and the advanced rules also help. Upgraded rating to 7. With more plays, make that an 8 rating ... Vikings is a rare, deep game that has steadily gained in my esteem!

Vikings is hung around a brilliant pricing wheel, whereby random tiles and workers are placed.  When the last of a type of worker is obtained, the wheel spins and prices drop.

If you like Carcassone you'll also like Vikings.

I actually like it better than Carcassone (I always play w/Inns and Cathedrals, no more, no less) so far.

Comparison:

It has the same feel and mechanics as Carc, but it is more "gamey".  Yes luck plays some role in Vikings, but not to the same extant as Carc.  Not even close.

The playing time is similar.

For me Vikings is equally fun with 2-4 players.  I think Carc is best with 2 and gets worse as you add more players.

Components are similar.

I do think Carc is more friendly to newbies and children, but Vikings isn't that much more difficult to grasp.  Any adult who is not afraid of bord games will completely grasp the game after 1 play.

Carc is prettier in the end.  You do not end up with a beutiful layout of cities, roads and countryside. You just end up with two sets of linear archipeligos.  But the artwork is nice.  

I love the Gold Wheel!  It is auction without bidding.  The problem with auctions is that newcomers have no idea of valuation, yet auctions do even out luck.  The perfect middle ground is a Gold Wheel.  Value is much easier to grasp for beginners, but luck has much less influence for gamers.  It is clever and may well be a mechanic seen many more tile-laying games. 

Vikings also comes with an expansion (about 20 additional tiles and a rule sheet) for more advanced play.  I haven't even glanced at this yet so I cannot comment on the play.  I can say, that it is pretty cool that the expansion is included in the base game.
It is something they could have charged $8-$10 for later as the base game is very good on it's own, but they threw it in. Very nice.

I still have a place in my collection for Carcassone, but if I had to choose between the two, I'd pick Vikings.

Update:  Rating stays the same. Still love that gold wheel.

  


Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

The advanced game is the only way to play.  Lots of great choices about how much to bid for start player, which Viking to throw away, which sets to put out depending on the tiles available and when to pay for a bonus tile.  Very enjoyable game.

This game hits a strange sweetspot for me...like, the tile-laying, auctioning, building type of game.  It's amalgamation of many different mechanics makes it magically fun!  The "auction wheel" is an elegant way to make prices fluctuate as well.  The theme feels somewhat pasted on, however, and that might just be because I expect Vikings to kill each other rather and raid islands...and stuff...

Just an old fashioned euro.  Neat little tidy package.  Fun to look at the configuration and figure out all of the nifty moves tucked away.  The coin bits are just a treat.  Probably my favorite of all cardboard currency. I expect this to rise with more plays.  These valuation games can be tricky the first couple of plays, and my geekbuddies are pretty consistent with its depth.  I haven't played the "progress" version, but I"m saving it until its clearly necessary.  Timing, valuation, and a clean rule set.  This is one of my sweet spots and it hits it quite well.  I'll revisit this comment after 8 plays, but I think 7 is my minimum.  

The rule of not being able to ake a 0 column unless its the last of the viking type makes the decisions in the game so much more juicy.  Plus with the standard 2 player game, the conflict over maximizng goldsmiths and fisherman but at the expense at giving your opponent first shot at cheaper warriors is the crux of every round.  

I would call this game carcassone with shopping.

Five games plays out the game out of the box.  The progress version from here on out for me.  Wow, the multiple paths to victory just exploded out of the game.  The added decision points, and there is just so much to consider.  I am thinking this game is deeper than it appears.  The special power tiles are a must.  The added choice of paying more with a special  power, vs. opening a cheap special power for your opponent adds to a tricky valuation as it is.  Plus, it helps open up skewed strategies.  Good good times.  I think the "progress variant" without the auction adds two points on the rating of the game, breathes so much life and replayability into the game. I am glad I played the "base" game for a few plays as the nuance was easier to pick up. Probably after many plays, the auction will be added, as it will be easier to value what going first means. 

The game forces you to deal with unique situations constantly, and makes it tricky to price items.  The boats may come out way before warriors.  Warriors may constantly be tossed back into the box, make the player vulnerable.  A steady stream of boatsman enhancements may come out, making the competition for most unique., etc.  The adapting to the situations that come up, and the shifting value of the special tiles etc.  Anyways, this game is tricky and underrated.

Surprisingly fresh German-style game, and a solo outing from Michael Kiesling (of Kramer & Kiesling fame, e.g., Tikal, Maharaja, Torres). I'd overlooked the game when it first came out because it looked like just another boring game with recycled mechanics and a pasted on theme, but I was wrong. A friend convinced me to give it a try, and I quickly went out to purchase a copy later that week. The "advanced rules" are what make the game good and I recommend skipping right to those if you have any board gaming experience. There are loads of interesting decisions to make in this game and a plethora of scoring options that have kept me coming back for 10 plays so far, and hopefully many more to come.

[thing=27173][/thing] is a somewhat light tile laying game, in which the players buy tiles in order to form their village. However, vikings (ships) will come and deactivate the meeples in the tiles if they aren't protected by a warrior (black) meeple.

The meeples do things accordingly to their color:

- Black - protects the tiles from vikings;
- Red - gives victory points;
- Yellow - gives gold;
- Blue - feeds the meeples;
- Green - gives a benefit to all other meeples (except the black);
- Grey - takes meeples from the reserve to put in the tiles.

The ships, though they can be a problem, also give one of two things: victory points or money.

When a player buys a tile he must add it somewhere, respecting the tile laying rules. Every tile comes with a meeple, and if the row the player adds the tile is the same of that meeple, he can leave the meeple in the tile, otherwise the meeple goes to the reserve.

Players get points by the most completed islands, by the largest island, by meeples and ships, by grey unused meeples, and lose points by meeple that aren't feed.

[thing=27173][/thing] is a smart game, one that deserves your attention if you like this sort of easy going game, that still requires thought and has depth.

RATING: N/A
This has been on my radar due to the pricing wheel, but having watched a good video on it I'm not sure I need to own it.

The pricing wheel matches a price to a pairing of a tile (island or ship) or a meeple (of varying colors). The population of the wheel isn't completely random as ships are sorted above (i.e. in price) island tiles and the colors have a sorting order as well. You cannot take the free option unless that's the only way to get that color of meeple, and if you do take it, this triggers the price drops for the other players (so that there is always a free option).

I really wanted to like this game but it was just too long and cumbersome for what it is.  I enjoyed the purchasing/wheel machanism - that was something I haven't seen before.  The artwork are pretty and the pieces are of a high standard.  

Update: Second play was better, but felt it was luck heavy.  It is fun for what it is and I would give it another go.  It was faster the second time around as well and wasn't dragging like the first game.  The bonus pieces also added that little something extra which helped.

A fine eurogame tried with 2P (maybe more interesting with more?)...interesting balance between tiles you can afford and potential points to score, with some medium term planning. I like tension among money and getting tiles according to your development. One of the few euros that works fine with 2p.

Writing this a week after I played it, this game just wasn't too memorable. I remember battling for the tiles and people and having a big late-game scoring shift. But I don't remember if I enjoyed it, if I want to play it again, if I liked the design. Probably not a great sign. It's at the very least a 6 though, and it seemed like a solid enough design to merit a 7.

The rating is for the "progress" game, with the bidding for start player, variable meeple placement, weak boatmen, and special tiles. The basic game is fine for a play or two to get the hang of it, but play the progress game after that. It's a medium-weight game, short and with plenty to think about.

RATING: 7.5
Rating for 2 player games with special action tiles. Pretty meaty Euro-style optimization game that plays very well with two. One of the few games with an auction mechanic that is enjoyable with that number of players, and it achieves it without the need for an artificial "neutral player". The original (and pretty straightforward) market wheel mechanic is brilliant. Rules are pretty simple, although the sheer number of scoring opportunities can seem a little daunting at first. In the base game, it is a bit unforgiving: It can be difficult to compensate for any mistakes made in the first two rounds. This does change with the introduction of the special tiles however. If you, like me, love to explore a game's mechanics, than this could be a good game for you. And it does not take more than 1 to 1.5 hours to play. Forget about the theme though - this game might as well have been about assets. Still, the little Viking meeples are very nice :-).

An ok abstract bidding game. The game plays well with two players but probably shines with more. The bidding is less tension-filled and hence, we always had a glut of money. The auction wheel is indeed a unique mechanic, but I am still trying to grasp the strategy behind it. Often times, my strategy hinges on getting the right island tile to complete islands or to place the folks before scoring. However, I am unable to combine all three variable to find the best strategy just yet. Not a bad game at all, but not exactly edge of the seat stuff.

It's a perfectly fine game, but it is another (currently) out of print game that's elevated in the rankings well beyond its actual worth. Unbelievably fiddly and the scoring is just ridiculous.

This is one of those rare commodoties, a game that plays well with 4 people that plays equally well with 2, maybe even better.  It has a little bit of everything.  There's auctioning for start player, manipulating prices, there's buying tiles, building islands playing with meoples, varying abilities and scoring victory points.  Yet with all the different mechanisms in play, it still doesn't leave me with that empty "I needed n more turns to do enough to be interesting" feeling like Yspahan did and it was fairly quick (less than 60 minutes).  All in all a great game with lots to do and very little down time.

BASIC GAME: My first game was underwhelming, but I wonder if that would be the case for anyone learning the game.  It's not difficult to manage or understand, but there are so many different little rules going on here that I felt lost for the first half.  There are some interesting balancing mechanisms here, but there's also a lot of randomness that determines part of the game.  This isn't a bad thing in and of itself, and it didn't seem to throw an advantage one way or the other (I still managed to keep a competitive second place by the end of the game, despite all these issues), but it just didn't feel engaging or interesting.  I'd like to play it again, now that I know what's going on.  Given the current ranking of the game, I feel like there's something important I'm missing.

ADVANCED GAME: The advanced game has a lot of extra fiddliness that doesn't seem to add anything more to the game, other than a lot of fiddliness.  It doesn't remove any of the luck issues, and there's no more control, and no real advantage for all the extra work.  It just gets more aggravating at that level, and I don't see that there's anything new or groundbreaking with the game.  It's just not my thing.

This is a terrible Viking game. I think the only ones getting pillaged are your own villages. Maybe "Invaders!" would have been a better title.

That aside, the game is fantastic. Players take turns buying a random pairing of a tile and a colored meeple. A very clever pricing wheel changes the market value of the various pairings any time someone takes the free offering. After that, it's just a very simple tile laying game. But that's the beauty, you can explain this game in 5 minutes flat. Yet the pricing wheel provides a ton of game space, planning and push your luck elements. It's way more fun than the sum of its parts, as is true of most classic Euros.

Little more than a "pick the best tile that happens to be available" game like Maori, where winners are decided by good timing (i.e. luck) more often than tactical skill.

I felt that Michael Kiesling's quintessential 1 hour Euro definitely had a place in my collection, especially now that Hawaii exists as Vikings is like a shorter, reductionist version of Greg Daigle's much longer game that would come years later.

Vikings' mechanics are neat, from the tile & Viking purchase to the island forming and scoring, making it a swift one to teach and get played. I'm glad I found the reprint at a reasonable price!

An instant hit. Plenty of choices to make and the timing of your choice is important - get the right tile and viking at the right time for the right price. Simple mechanics. Looks good. Love the wheel of prices. Advanced rules (and extra tiles) will add strategy and game replayability without having to learn too many new rules. It is so quick to play too. I am sure it will get played a lot.

This game has grown on me.  There are a lot of interesting interactions.  I don't normally like auction games, but this one is pretty good!

This was the first game I played at my first board game convention taught to me and my wife by Jay Tummelson (over at Rio Grande Games).

Really interesting and different game packed into a short play time.  Did get my behind kicked the first time I played it.  I've played it with 3 and with 4.  3 seems more tense, as you end up with more picks from the wheel, and hence, more viking ships.  I'm looking forward to playing the advanced game next time.

For the advanced game, play with the cards and weaker boatmen, but skip the auction - doesn't really add very much.

This is slowly becoming one of my favorite games to play.

It has a great puzzle element, tension among players and many interesting decisions. I'm sure that the number of strategies will eventually get old (there are only so many times you can win via fishermen for instance).

A very good, fast, simple enough game where you try to build your archipelago of viking islands and put the right inhabitants on them.
Average components, nice board.
Mechanics aren't exceptionally new to me (but the game is quite old now...) but interesting.
The good part: you really have to struggle for the best balance among the different kinds of vikings.
The shortcoming: scarse interaction.

It can dfinitely become a 8 after i will have played some more games on Yucata (first game i tried it live)

RATING: 7.5
On one hand the game is pretty straight forward, which would lead someone to believe it'd be easy to master, but on the other hand with the continually changing game elements it's a bit out of control.  I really like that the game goes quickly because it allows a player to get beyond what might be a bad draw of tiles and/or vikings to play again.  Overall it's fun and definitely challenging at times.

Close to perfect.  Quick play time.  Spatial puzzle-logic with quirky but cutthroat bidding mechanism.  Short-term gains vs. long term strategy decisions.  Only draw back is that for all the symmetry in the design, the 3rd and 4th players get screwed in a 4 player game in terms of turn order and going first.  A nice side bonus - the wife loves this game, too!

Light game, somewhat reminiscent of Carcassonne. Plays quite fast, but has some interesting mechanisms. The price wheel is rather clever, as is the interdependency (to a point) of the veeples. Theme is very thin, but that doesn't stop the fun.

Tile laying plus island building equals population growing, point-producing happiness.  Very under-appreciated here on the 'Geek, Vikings is an exceedingly well designed Michael Kiesling game.

Don't allow any one to buffalo you into believing this is multi-player solitaire.  I can't count the number of times I wanted to cry as an opponent nabbed a tile I dearly coveted.  

You read that right--I said, "Nabbed."  Though not 'technically' correct (because the tile laid itself bare on the open market) It. Was. Mine. 

There are enough variabilities to keep this game fresh for a long--enjoyably long--time.  Building islands, then populating them with various skilled colonists, and protecting them from nasty viking-laden ships to score big points is a joy.  Must remember to employ fisherman too, as those colonists insist on eating.

Bonus points at the end of the game keep the winner secret until they are finally tallied.  I like this element in a game.  Keeps every one on their toes throughout the match.

Easy to learn as well as teach, an advanced game that allows people to grow into a richer, deeper experience of gaming, and it is pleasurable to watch your island collection grow.

Family fun, gamer friendly.  :)

That Offering dial tho--I can almost hear the turning and rumbling of large stone when It rotates lol.  This is very much like Carcasonne with a purchase-before-the-other-guy-does feel to it.  Loved the Mainland-board mechanic, you can sense the pressure of the boat threat if a warrior isn't there to deflect their attack.  Tight game. The instructions are very thorough although seem a bit hard to understand because of the order they are presented in.  Recommend a quick watch of Game Boy Geek's YouTube review although he has the tiles appearing out of order around the wheel lol.

Vikings has often been accused of not being very thematic, which fair enough. The theme could have been pretty much anything, but I do enjoy how adorable the little viking meeples are.

The rondel and tile-laying aspects of the game really work for me. Choosing both a tile and a meeple with the same action provides an interesting choice. If I can find a spot where I want both, excellent! If I can't, would I rather go for the tile or the meeple I want? How much am I willing to spend? All this while managing money to ensure I can get what I want when I want it as well as building up my different meeple types in each row to get bonuses. Vikings also scales amazingly well. I enjoy it equally at 2, 3, and 4 players and it plays pretty quickly at all player counts.

Autopilot drafting meets personal jigsaw puzzle. Blue and yellow vikings are irrefutably the best, and just in case you needed a push in that direction the pieces always start on the cheap side of the wheel. Yellow vikings provide moolah for much-needed purchasing power and/or end-game VP's while blue vikings only get better in quantity and as the game progresses because overfeeding is worth 8 points - more than a red counted in every round and one point shy of a perfect green. Third strike is that a green's value is contingent upon accompanying yellow and blue, practically solidifying the draft lineup of yellow/blue => black/green => red/ship, meaning the outcome boils down to favorable terrain acquisition and amounts of blues/yellows per round (always better for first player to pull totals of 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, or 11 because he can snag the extra), which of course is decided by bag-pulling randomness. Hard not to laugh at viking islands segregated by color + black meeples though. Remember in Puerto Rico where colonists from the slave ship were black? That was awesome.

I'd kind of ignored this game as a Viking game with no pillaging sounded odd. But when it got a reprint I looked into it a bit more and it looked perfect for where my taste in gaming is running lately (fairly simple to explain, not hard to set up/ take down, still provides lots of interesting decisions) and it is!  Feeling out the right time to buy more expensive tiles or to take the zero and make everything cheaper for everyone else balanced with developing your islands so you can get your tiles in place and your meeples working as quickly as possible makes this an excellent medium weight Euro.

Note:  I generally play between the regular and advanced game.  We leave out the auction but do include the bonus tiles.

Played once at Essen 2007 with 2 players (basic version). I enjoyed. The rules are faily straightforward. The turn table auction is a rather nice mechanic. It plays quickly (with 2). I can see it becoming harder to plan ahead with 3 or 4 players, although it might also add a bit of tension not knowing for sure if a certain tile or colored person will still be around next turn. Didn't grab me enough to buy it, but I will play it of someone suggests it.

RATING: 6
Unique purchasing decisions combining the island tile and the type of meeple that comes with it.  I also like how scoring is affected by the interaction between the different vikings, some of it was dependent on what kind you have and how they are placed.  What I didn't care for was how starting player always have the advantage and there was no way to mitigate this, nor to change the turn order besides it being passed to the next person each round.  Therefore, it really came down to how lucky you are in the drawing of the tiles and the vikings when you get the initial selection.  Not to mention there is an odd number of phases, so essentially the very first player would get this benefit twice in the game compared to everyone else.

It all started off so well but after a few plays this stopped being enjoyable to play. I'm not sure why. Maybe I'm just bad at it. The 2P game without the expert rules is too uninteresting. I do like the central tile-taking mechanism but the randomness of the tile draw can be screwy.

Sure the theme doesn't really make sense, I mean did Vikings really collect enemy ships from a giant wheel in the sky just so they could attack their own men? But it's still a clever game with lots of strategic options. It can feel like you're just 'playing against yourself' but that doesn't make it any less fun.

Game 1: Basic rules. Missed a couple rules.
Game 2: Advanced rules (without auction). Made sure to play correctly. These two things combined for a much more enjoyable game that really had both players thinking hard about their moves.
Game 5: Played 3-player game for the first time. It didn't feel all that different with 3. Each player had fewer tiles but it felt pretty much like the 2-player game.

Only one game so far but it was really a nice one. Short but deep game. Lots of interaction, only drawback is the heavy use of all kinds of scorings (I guess you get it going smoothly after two or three games but still - you definitely can't see how many points you get in one round without extensive maths).
Good overall design (also the components). Michael Kiesling showed that he still has everything it takes to be one of the best designers (also concerning the target group of this game, well suitable for everyone).

Victory Games' Fleet series is outstanding, and 2nd Fleet is my favourite as it covers the GIUK gap and North Atlantic and so includes many British units.

RATING: 5
A very good and simple system, that is slightly let down by the technology to print good counters then.

The scenarios are good basic training for such a game.

However, these simple scenarios are not very replayable, as a player could easily calculate the number of turns a unit would reach a certain place and the best odds for an attack, as there are no other targets (much) to choose from.

Campaign game is the way to go.

My first exposure to the "Fleet" series was "7th Fleet". I gave away the game, so when I saw "2nd Fleet" on sale at On Military Matters, I got this. I like the system, and this edition. Interesting scenarios, great geography, and cool hardware.

I really enjoyed the one time I played this... so much so that I picked up 5th and 7th. One mechanic that was really cool was the phase picking (subs, surface or air).

Reminds me of playing the old computer game Harpoon, i.e., it embraces the unthinkable, frightening spectre of war between the US and Soviets (if you were old enough to have lived in this era :))

When I was in high school I went to a gaming sleepover that turned into a movie-watching night, featuring some movie or other that I had no interest in. My friend had this game in his closet, that he had acquired from some relative, and he'd never opened the box. I spent the rest of the night, and the next morning, sorting the chits and trying to figure out the rules. I played a couple of small scenarios with one of my other friends, who won handily. That was my first experience with a wargame. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good simulation of the critical Northern Europe/Arctic region.  The scenarios are nice and tight and the campaign game is enjoyable, particularly if you play it like the Red October idea and score VP's for getting the Soviet subs off the west map edge.

RATING: 4
Had a bit of fun with this ages ago, but realistically not a great game - too complicated, and who wants to play the Soviets? You get to try to trade your fleet for an invasion of Norway or Iceland, with your ships eventually getting blasted by the US & British carriers & subs one way or the other.

Our fav of the Fleet series growing up - Hunt for Red October, here we come! Those Backfire bombers always caused the Americans major grief, and the intro of better sub rules and a better search engine made this the true beginning of Fleet for us. Been a while, but I'd still love a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Another triumphant addition to the Fleet series, 2nd Fleet lets you hold or break the GIUK line, or try NATO's 'forward' policy and get into those Soviet bastions where the SSBNs lurk, and where Backfires menace from the Soviet bases. Clever without being complicated, and eminently soloable, the system concentrates on overall operations and deployment of resources, and the scenarios are flavoursome. There is a fair amount of factor counting and of course all those ratings could be debated, but the whole thing seems to give a good feel for the sorts of issues faced by both sides in what would have been a critical theatre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I have enjoyed both campaigns and shorter scenarios from this title.  It was my first, and remains my favorite entry in the series.  I suspect that this is because the Soviet forces here are very competitive whereas I have seen communist adversaries in 7th fleet be pushovers.The series can be faulted for having near insane amounts of modifiers on the combat processes.  I have my own homebrewed worksheet that tracks the various details (see file section), so things flow pretty seamlessly.

The game system works well for me.  Produces tense and well fought games.  There are some monumental struggles e.g. soviet air assets trying to break up NATO carrier groups before they escort land units over the atlantic.  The sense of achievement when you win one of these encounters is wonderful.

I must admit that I am suprised how often the Russian missiles fail to suceed, this may be a lack of luck the dice gods may favour the USA not the godless Soviets.  I find it hard to imagine what it would be like to sit in a floating steel city packed full of explosives and aviation fuel watching the blips of 100 huge USSR missiles closing in.

This may not have the integrity of Harpoon but I can realistically expect to play this game and to savour its highs and lows.  This subject matter is so rarely covered and this is VG at its golden period producing some of the best game ever made.

Picked up a number of orphan Victory Games for sentimental reasons after the demise of Avalon Hill. In general, the entries in the Victory Games line are more detailed and chrome-riddled than my preference. On the other hand, they had the top designers from the former SPI and the games are noted for simulation value and for scenarios that do not require playing the entire game. The rule books are generally well-written and thorough, and fun to read even if you never get around to playing the games.

I bought this in the early nineties at the now defunct Games Inc in Plymouth, and, like a certain girl back in University, I loved it intensely at the time. It's been with me through three major relationships, seven flats/houses, four dogs and two cats!

This game is one to return to over and over. Low-prep is all about desperately trying to prevent a Soviet rout of NATO and a break out, which is the scenario I always seem to return to. Then again, an incursion into the Barents Sea is always seat-of-the-pants exciting, too. Great detail, and it rewards the effort you put into learning it's procedures.

The main reason it doesn't come out much anymore is that I and my gaming buddies simply don't have the time and space to commit to playing and keeping this leviathan out. Also, the game tends to see-saw every time.

Despite this, a classic.

Fun system, and now the the era has passed it seems nostalgic rather than nightmarish. The Fleet system has some of the finest wargames rules ever written -- clear, comprehensive, and work equally well for reference and learning the game. They are works of art, really. Smaller scenarios subject to fragility (due to low counter mix and initiative flips) and railroading (due to tight turn limits that often require you to move directly toward an objective with little room for maneuver). Not so bad if you accept that captains have their orders, and so will you ... and the game really comes into its own with the Intermediate scenarios, where you have to balance your three arms of service and every turn becomes a tactical puzzle. Love this game.

Enjoyable game set in the "hypothetical"
However, like most games depicting a Soviet/NATO war, the game itself is slanted in favor of the US type forces.
I've often wondered if that would have been the reality or if it was really just wishful thinking.
For this game, it is fun in itself, if limited in scope and it's VERY hard to go back to it once you play the more advanced sequels like, say, 7th Fleet with better weapons (sea skimmers) and more potential for non-WW3 regional conflicts.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
very disappointed with the campaign game as published.  the random special events and too-random reinforcements are just too important to the balance of the game.

various combinations of soviet strategy, game length, and preparedness are also not balanced.

you really don't want to have to house-rule a long campaign that you will only play once every blue moon.

Rating after 1 play of a f2f intermediate scenario. I got a strong impression of the cold war setting. The rules for task forces in combat did seem a little clunky compared to everything else but that might be because I haven't read the rules.

update 2015: I think that Breaking the Chains is much better and modern game. So I cannot see ever returning to Fleet series.

Theme of game is fantastic. Unfortunately playing of game was little tedious and little bit too much work with all marker fiddling resolution of combats etc. Also as other pointed for example resolution of SSM attacks seems strange

I am looking forward to Breaking the Chains from Compass because I hope it will solve some of my criticisms

RATING: 8
The sole game in the Fleet series I've kept over the years. Sadly it doesn't have all the chrome/essentials of the later games (i.e. fast missiles, deep mode subs et al), but on the other hand it is very playable. 

Do read the chapter in Red Storm Rising where the soviets attack the Enterprise surface group for inspiration!

UPDATE: Returned to this gem for the first time in ten or so years. We started out with the first and third scenarios as introduction, took about an hour or so to re-absorb the basic rules over one scenario. We then jumped on the last of the intermediate scenarios -- they aren't really that much more complex, but do go to play over both maps and with a lot more units. Great fun! I recon we'll play this again in the future, using all the rules and the logistics rooster. Looking forward to it.

Oh, and BTW the game has aged wonderfully. It does not feel like a 22 years old game at all when you look at the counter and map art. Well done, Victory Games!

The first game I encountered with the Victory Game's modern fleet series. Perceivably a complex air-sea joint operations simulation, at the core of the game is really a simple operations-driven system. The game focuses on the world stage hotspot where potential conflict might have erupted into full-scale war between Soviets and the US and his NATO allies. All the battleships, cruisers, destroyers ,submarines, aircraft carriers are all included in accordance with the historical fleet designation, not to mention the dozen types of all the modern air fighters. Different types of sea-air operations are simulated with various scenarios and scenario lengths. The fleet series games introduce many modern military doctrines and concepts like Combat Air Partorl (CAP), area sea search, aircraft readiness, the strengthened role of aircraft carriers as distinguished from naval assets and the joint operation between navy and air forces. Combined arms concept move from between different land forces (tank & infantry & artillery) to air and naval forces (bomber & fighter & battleship). A much more effective regional war effort is amplified by the modern war machine capabilities.  2nd Fleet covers the North Atlantic and Scandinavian areas where the story of "The Hunt for Red October" and the real "K-19" operations take place. An excellent game and an interesting interactive designs. You can have a lot of food for thoughts while playing this game, a lucrative gaming experience indeed.

This is even better than sixth fleet.  It is a great system and there are 14 scenarios (4 basic, 9 intermediate, and 1 advanced).

Relatively clean wargame system and the results seem plausible.  Certainly the most popular detailed ops level modern naval game available (and relatively easy to find on the secondary game market).

Dug this game out of the big game box I have and dusted it off.  Started playing the intro games solitair.  Starting to get the hang of the mechanics.  Liking it more each time.

Fantastic Cold War thriller, lots of drama in the campaign game because the forces slowly draw together vs the free-fire approach present in most of the Fleet games.  2nd and 7th have the best rules balance in the series; detailed but not overly esoteric.

RATING: 7.5
My favorite in the fleet series, 2 rather than 3 maps and (mostly) compatible with the rest of the series (unlike 6th fleet).

The Fleet Series games by Victory Games are unique and original. There may be some play balance issues but there is little else on the market for operational/strategic naval operations. Of course with the imperfect implementation of fog of war inherent in the un-umpired board game format this games are not perfect simulations but they are great games.

I love this game.  Great detail and a terrific setting.  Main problem is its complexity.  Used to have a friend who I played with, but can't find anyone willing to do so now.

This game came out in 1986, just when I was getting into serious gaming. I remember being daunted by the Fleet series back then – those games looked like they were serious business, and I was only a fledgling wargamer. Now, more than 25 years later, having finally acquired and played a copy, I'm not sure whether I should regret all the years I've wasted not playing the game, or be glad I can appreciate in my (gaming) maturity the shiny brilliance of the design. The rules and components are clear, well designed and logical, and the game is very accessible but not simplistic – you will quickly forget the "gaming" aspect, and focus on experiencing the situation.

I finally got this out of storage and dusted it off. I still need to go through the counters and see if anything is missing. I found notes I made comparing the ship values with those found for the same class of ship in 7th fleet 18 years ago! Isn't nostalgia good :)

If you enjoy naval combat games, this is a good modern version.  The rules aren't for the faint of heart and you may find yourself hunting a while to track down a particular ship, but it's modern naval combat at a fine level.

Very long, very fiddly, and not particularly accessible.  Fun if you're into the genre and not so bad to pick up if you've played other games in the series, but definitely limited interest for many.

RATING: 8.6
One of the best games I ever played, and the best available look at modern naval warfare at operational scale. For naval enthusiast it is easier to play than "Harpoon", and while, admittedly, the two games have different scale/purpose ("Harpoon" is a tactical game focusing on the single weapon systems), "2nd Fleet" allows you to easily grasp both strengths, weaknesses and roles of various modern platforms. The rules are clearly written and not too complicated. Scenarios abound, and even the campaign game comes with different starting situations/readiness levels. My only complaint: it is markedly unbalanced, with NATO usually having the upper edge. The best of the "Fleet" series (along with "Sixth Fleet" if you take the easy steps needed to port the improvements of "2nd Fleet" rule set to the earlier game).

I enjoy playing all of the games in the Fleet series. Of all the games in the series, 2nd Fleet is my favorite. I love all those Soviet subs without the distraction of some of the third world navies. I've been thinking about upgrading the game to use 3rd Fleet rules. I just can't find the time.

Here are the big guns. The huge Soviet North Sea Fleet is here so be prepared for a high-intensity battle.

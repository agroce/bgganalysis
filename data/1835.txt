My mom and I end up playing this game every year while my father is napping or working.  She complains that I alwaysbeat her, which I do.  I think this game might be more difficult with more players.  With just two, it's really just multiplayer solitaire and you only have to remember items that the other person got.  The art on one side is beautiful and challenging, while the art on the other side is appropriately silly and cartoony, making for two different gaming experiences.  It's a nice tradition we have when I visit.

Great party game for large numbers of people.  Even a couple can enjoy the art and finding images that their opponent won't.  Scattergories-esque, as you must cross out answers you have in common with your opponents, which forces one to look for the less obvious items.  Not a game to take out EVERY get-together, but a very accessible and beautiful game nonetheless.  One of my more favorite party games.  [Thrift $1.09]

Fairly decent party game, as long as nobody has all the cards memorized from playing it all the time.

One that might be worth busting out every once in a while for something different.

Seems to work pretty well as a couple's game.

Simple thrift store find where things must be found on real beautiful pictures. I like the fact that the list for each themed picture is included, so no misinterpretations of the rules. Fun team game as well.

Super duper party game.. but have you noticed a lot of people put up extreme resistance when you suggest pulling out a party game?

My wife loves this.. basically a "find more stuff in the picture than anyone else can in one minute." That's round 1. Round 2, you search the same pictures for more things that nobody else has mentioned yet. We've concluded that Round 2 is not fun and leads to great disappointment, but only in small groups. Have yet to test it with larger groups.

There is, unfortunately, one big flaw I've identified which probably led to the game being relatively unknown (and remaindered from the stores, which is how I got it for less than $4) -- you can't watch the hourglass timer and search the pictures at the same time. We use an electronic kitchen timer.

My mom bought this game for us at a garage sale. My wife and I love this game. The replay value is not infinite, but after many plays, we still enjoy finding new objects in the drawings. I think my favorite part is the discussion about the game after the fact looking at what others found and finding obvious items you missed. This is also a good game to introduce to those who aren't very competitive as the fun is in what YOU can find.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I highly recomend this game.  It's a visual game.  You get a letter and cover up a portion of the picture and try to find as many things as possible that start with that letter. Sounds like there wouldn't be replayability, but there is one side that is all, play-on-words, and the other side has very obscure things, really good for vocab building, and trying to rack your brain for the name of bugs, greek gods, and 
so on.  A game I highly recomend.

I'm glad to have this game, because other people seldom turn down a chance to play , and I really like to play games.  On the other hand, I don't really get the draw of this one.  I usually win, so I should like it, but for some reason, I just don't.

RATING: 6
Cool little "Where's Waldo" type game. The images are very busy with items that you have to name off boggle style for a pre-selected alpha. The only real downside, aside from your eyes burning out of the sockets after a few rounds, is that people start to memorize the images and it becomes a bit mechanical and "memory" like after you have played it a few too many times. They should have come out with an expansion set of images to prolong the life of the game.

Got the book (that half of the game is based on) from Matt.

The artwork is beautiful, and the production quality of the whole game is quite good. However, the game itself is rather dull. It works like a trivia game, based more on one's vocabulary than creativity. Also, during game play everyone is hunched silently over the pictures instead of shouting or gesturing for all to see. That's not much fun for a party game.

This is in my top three of favorite games.  I absolutely LOVE this game.  The pictures are so beautiful and practically EVERTHING in the picture can be related to that topic or letter.  The other side of the pictures are comical as well.  You see something new each time you play!  The second round is the most fun.  Too bad they never made more cards for it though.

This is a game we play about once a year. The two of us will run through most of the pictures. Then it has to go back on the shelf, until we forget some of the go-to words.

We don't play with the second round where you're penalized for re-using words.

This game is really more fun when more people play--we have found it boring with only two people. The game experience being fun depends on how creative and educated the participants are. Succeeding in this game is spotting things no one else will--and participants who can't do this by drawing on their education, creativity or humor really weaken the experience. Still the illustrations are lush with detail and fun to peruse in-between games due to its high production value. The 12 "classic" illustrations are more interesting, but the 12 "humourous" cartoon illustrations have been more enjoyable for most participants with whom we've played.

Reminds me of the "Where's Waldo" books I loved when I was younger. Except that in this game, there are thousands of different Waldo's, and you'll never be able to write them all down in time. On top of that, only unique finds count for points. Pretty fun!

I enjoyed looking for items amongst the very nice artwork, but I did not enjoy the speed writing required. It seems that "scrutinizing" a given one of the twelve pictures would be close to enough. Many of the answers were controversial, causing too many legality debates.

Novel combination of Scattergories and hidden picture puzzles.  The pictures are very detailed (if a little heavy on bird species), so it should be good for a couple plays before it starts to feel samey.  Also, games that use the "Scattergories mechanic" of writing down everything you see and comparing with other players always feel like a slog as you spend most of the game frantically writing.

A pretty standard "name all the items you can think of and then check for the same item on your opponent's list" type of game, but the artwork is very original and unique.  The surrealist style (and slightly creepy inclusion of the artist) in each painting might give me crazy dreams, but I still couldn't look away...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A quick and funnish little game with interesting art.  Players work in teams of two to find and write down as many things in a picture that fit a particular category (e.g. "things that start with 'D'" or "famous people").  

Each picture panel is double sided, with a cartoony picture on one side and artsy picture on the other side.  Both are really fun to look at--the cartoony side is funny and the artsy side is often very clever.  Honestly, just studying the pictures is probably more fun than actually playing the game.

The artsy side also works better for the game, though I don't think either side works well enough.  The problem is that the game basically devolves into "who can write the quickest".  The questions are fixed for a particular picture and literally every thing in the picture is related to that question.  This makes them interesting to study, but bad for the game since you are never actually "searching" for anything--the bottleneck becomes your speed-writing rather than your scrutinizing ability.  More groups and more rounds of play might help combat this problem since you will need to be more clever about which answers you write down to actually score points.

A friend kickstarted this and brought it in to play during lunch.  It was a fast game - so fast we got two games in.  The first one I lost - but it was close, 18 to 14.  I went to owning all of one land, and using the smallest coins first - turns out that isn't exactly what you want.

The second game I kicked ass with 20 some points to his 14... I led with low coins, and I moved or captured coins until I owned all of two lands.  It was awesome.

[b]28.10.2014 - After 6 plays[/b]
[b]BACKGROUND[/b]: This is the first non-card microgame that I have played. I cannot say that I am looking for microgrames (as I prefer longer/heavier games), but since the gaming time with my wife has decreased alot, I am starting to appreciate smaller/faster games. 

[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]: "Area-controlling in 5 minutes" is the sentence that can describe best this game. Eight Minute Empire does not take 8 minutes, but this one is finished in 5. Although she has 10 "coins" in different sizes/denomination, the player does not know which one she can place on the map, as a "coin roll" must be done before taking an action. This "hidden units" mechanism makes for some nice tactical decision, as you never know what coins you can place.

[b]ART/COMPONENTS[/b]: The components are those of a microgame: 2 credit card sized, double sided boards with 20 cardboard coins. I think would be cool to play it with real US coins (as the dimensions of the cardboard tokens matches those). Technically, this game can be played anywhere, as long as you have 20 coins and the boards in your wallet.

[b]DIFFICULTY[/b]: Although the rules are very easy, some notions of area control must be taught to a beginner. Also the scoring is a little bit strange.

[b]THOUGHTS[/b]: Even if it is not a game that I will ask at game nights, it is the perfect beer & pretzel game or even a "wife & bed" game.

Simple with a surprisingly interesting game lurking behind such minimalist trappings.  Interactive, lucky at times, but overall contains some interesting decisions.  For a couple of dollars how could it possibly be a poor purchase!

My only criticism is that the game comes with stickers and punch out coins - why reference American coins in the rules? Dimes? Pennies? Quarters? etc.  Seems a little ethnocentric and a silly oversight since they basically have a game currency to use. Still - the most minor of criticisms.

RATING: 6
Firstly and importantly, this game absolutely accomplishes what it sets out to do. This is a game that packs a surprising amount of punch into a little card and some tokens that can be toted just about anywhere, and there is something to be said for that.

There's a substantial luck factor here. In particular, it seems like being the one to end the game is hugely powerful, and much of the endgame boils down to pressing your luck (e.g., "There are four spaces left and he has two coins left. Do I only place one coin and hope that both his coins flip to my side, giving me a shot at the all-important final play? Or do I try to score as many points as possible now and give him the final turn?").

Compared to other area majority games I find it incredibly difficult to assess the value of any given location. It's really mathy for something so short and quick.

I'm not sure how I feel about the coins left over in your pile counting toward your score. Again, this just feels super dry and mathy for something fairly light.

But, there is some strategy to be had and the game certainly stays engaging for its short length. If you're looking for an ultra-portable simple game, it's hard to beat this.

This is an amazing little game.  Played on a credit card sized map, using actual pocket change for the game pieces, the game is one of the most portable ever invented.  It has a unique balancing mechanism that continues to self adjust during game play.  There are many decisions to be made each turn and subtle strategies emerge with repeated play.  This game appears deceptively simple, but there is a surprising depth.  You can print-and-play it to try it out if you like.  Everyone I have shown this game to has loved it.

I didn't start looking at Kickstarter for new and upcoming games until after this game took its run.  However, I've printed out the Print and Play and have enjoyed playing it a few times with my wife.  Very clever how they use the coins and stacking them on top in descending size order.  Only problem is that I do not carry change with me all that often, [i]especially[/i] enough to cover all coins required.

This is a really nice little game.  Slapping down the coins is a fun activity, and there is surely some strategy here despite the quick playtime.

An envelope game, and you get what you pay for, I guess.   Some good things:  multiple map cards, good looking stickers or cardboard coins.   Some bad things:  no reference cards for the actions (inexcusable), heavily luck-influenced game which depends on the flip of your coins.   It's pretty clever in some regards, with the stacking of different sized coins.  I'm just not sure that I would be inclined to play it very often, but it has the potential to improve with more plays.

Carry this in my wallet everywhere. It's a great little game that you can play at a restaurant or whenever you are waiting for food. The one downside is that I will only play this in those situations, so it is a drawback there. I will say that finding 1.56 in exact change can be fun in itself at times!

Cheap, fun, convenient. Can almost fit into a small wallet (probably will with a bigger one). Not the best or deepest game, but a nice way to pass the time.  High recommend because it's probably the easiest to transport board game in existence.

1st play: 8. SEP/14: Solid fun, a little confused by one rule we didn't read carefully.
2nd play: 9. SEP/14: A game that fits a perfect niche in my collection: a game that can fit into a slim pocket, and plays in 5 minutes.

I think the premise is a lot better than the gameplay. I really loved the idea a game I can fit in my pocket and play with change. Well that part is tough because the change requirements are rather unreasonable. But thats ok, how does the game actually play? Well I would say I love the slap the coins on the counter mechanic, but all too often the choice is just place a coin on a location. And once all the locations are filled the game is over. Which means we kinda just take turns filling the board, and then count up our points. There is very little of the push and pull that the games strategy is built around.

Finally got around to trying this out and played twice.  Seemed very luck dependent, but maybe we didn't play enough to figure out any strategy.  At least it was fast.  I'll give this another spin, but unless something clicks, it will likely head to the trade pile.

EDIT: Tried again with somebody else.  Nothing interesting about this game; the best I can say about it is that it's short.  Not worth the effort to explain.

The primary appeal of this game is that you can take it anywhere and play with coins, but it needs a good number of them in specific denominations. It's quick, simple and very light. There are a few tactical decisions, but luck seems to be very high and the game can literary be decided on the flip of a coin. The various maps don't really add much replayability and could have been printed a little larger in the commercial version.

Nice little area control game. This actually lives up to the microgame promise of being something you could keep in your pocket (or rather wallet, with the cool credit-card-plastic board). I don't think I'd usually have the exact change that the rules call for, but I think it would kinda work with whatever you happen to have on you. It's irrationally fun to slap down the coins.

Fun mini strategy game.  My 13 year-old plays this with me. Its a pretty simple 2 player game that can be downloaded online and here. The rules are fairly simple and the play strategy can be challenging. A fun pocket game that cost me $1.56 in coins for tokens. Printing and laminating of the cards might have added a few cents.

The game mechanics and size is interesting, but it's not because it's a small game that last 10 minutes that it should lack of depth or have dominant strategies.

Either there is some issues with the rules or either it requires much more development. Because the strategy is basically place you highest coin last and you win especially if you can double it's score.

People probably made other variants to fix this. I had some ideas like if you can recapture a pile you previously captured (ex: 3 coin, 2 coin, then 1 coin), Your coin could be worth 1 more extra point.

Another idea is that you could move a part of the stack of coins to reveal a coin you previously placed making become active again.

More novelty than anything else, this is a not-bad little game that shows how much you can do with a minimum of components and space. That said, does anyone really tote this around and play it? And while it plays well with just some coins, wouldn't you rather play something else? Or nothing at all?

I had no idea what to expect from this game -- I'd never heard of it and didn't have a clue what it was about.  But it ended up being a pretty pleasant surprise; for such a tiny game (it could literally fit in your pocket with room to spare), the depth of strategy is actually quite strong. To keep it interesting, multiple maps are provided (four with the basic game) so that you're compelled to change up your strategy from board to board.

Coin Age is very simply designed with just a handful of pieces (two cards and a handful of coins), but it looks just fine.  The theme is pretty loose and its sense of humor is corny, but it works well, forces you to think and pay attention without being really rules-heavy, and is so small and portable you could literally take it anywhere.

Very quick two-player game.

Elegant in the simplicity of its components: the only material needed is a handful of change. Although it does necessitate a specific combination of 20 coins.

There is a very good looking game board available for print and play, but since the board is the size of a credit card, the game can also be played by quickly scribbling a board on a small piece of paper.

Sweet little 2-player area control game using 2-sided dice (coins) and a single card.  Really cool idea, from TMG, whose games I love, and the KS is pay-what-you-want, with $3 allowing them to ship the card to you, and $5 giving them some profit.  Stretch goals are nice, too.  Even has PnP rules and card already.  Abigail got her own copies as well, and I gave a second copy to Joe since he LOVES things with maps.  Keep the credit card map in the wallet, though Lord knows I never have change.

For a short game that uses coins for game pieces and essentially works just as well as a PnP as any retail version - it's actually a LOT of fun!  We used to play penny hockey as a kid when waiting at the dinner table or even if we went out to eat.  Coin Age makes penny hockey look like - well, penny hockey.  Gotta hand it to the designer, he found a way to take ordinary household objects and make a truly fun game out of them.  One of those, "I wish I thought of that" type of things.

6.0 - Mar 2015 - 2 Plays:  While the game isn't groundbreaking, it does achieve what it sets out to do.  It's a small game that you can carry pretty much everywhere, plays quickly, and offers enough interesting choices for it's duration.

Fun and portable. The coin-slapping is cool, but not very friendly to glass tables. It's mostly area control. Luck playes a big role, since the pieces you are allowed to use in your turn are defined by the face showing on the coins.

Fun game but it feels like it needs a few special abilities or more differentiation between the different maps. Could easily be improved with home-variants though

I like it well enough.  Clever idea, nicely produced (except the envelope package is too long for it and bent out of shape shipping to me in the first place) and it plays quickly.  My wife, on the other hand, hates it and asked if it is even really a game.  She thinks there is too strong of a first player advantage but I disagree.

Simple micro-game where players slap coins onto the table and then use the actions that are granted in a area control contest that takes place on a small card.

A bit of luck, for sure, but actually some real decisions to make. Definitely play with real coins. The stickers provided in the Kickstarter work great!

This is actually more of an abstract game than anything else, especially since it has a surprising amount of strategy and thinking for something so short. It seems to me that controlling who has what coins, when coins are placed, and how/when to end the game are serious considerations. It was a great lunchtime game, and I've put the card in my wallet so that I can play it in bars or restaurants.

First of all, this is a brilliant idea, and the execution is excellent. I printed it out on some cardstock, and it looks great. The puns and area names are nice touches.

As for the game play, well, that remains to be seen. For now, it sure seems like going 1st sucks, as the 2nd place player has won both games with a game-ending (and game-winning) quarter placement. Then again, I suppose 1st could hold back and not allow 2nd to end it. Hmmm. Interesting. We'll have to try again!

Here we go, this micro game is really a 'filler's filler' where any game that goes beyond five minutes can fairly said to be dragging.

I have played a couple of games of Coin Age with Mrs Fish and she is pretty unimpressed. The game plays okay and the components are fine, it’s just that there is not much substance to it. Mrs Fish sees it as too luck heavy and, to damn with faint praise’ described it a “maybe a good travel game, something you could play on an aeroplane when you can’t sleep and don’t want to think.” 

I have tried it out with my lunchtime gaming friends during a three player game as something to do when one of us is on a call but they are similarly unenthused. I’ll give it a few more tries before I totally write it off, but so far it has not been overly impressive.

Really not a hard game. When it comes to fitting a game in as quick as possible, this is the choice. But it's almost like dice rolling, but instead of multiple/choices, it's a 50/50 shot for yours. I like outcomes when it shows your "faction," but the game can end abruptly. Still not bad for a print and play.

Most microgames in the market are just horrible games with very few components, or you burn them in a few games, after exploiting all the game has to offer.

But this one is a true microgame, it achieves what it intends: Fully portable in your wallet and enough deepness and entertainment value for the 5-10 minutes the game last.

The gameplay is fluid and the decisions meaningful. Several strategies are possible.

Definirlo un gioco mi sembra troppo un eufemismo, diciamo che è un'idea, o meglio un'ottima idea per ingannare il tempo con le prime due cose che si trovano in tasca facendo finta il tutto sia un gioco da tavolo. Idea simpatica, gioco veloce e senza pretese. Il rapporto tra materiali (nulli) e intrattenimento è eccellente sul resto avrei qualche cosa da dire.

I love the fact I can carry a game around in my wallet and have it with me all the time. 

And the game itself is surprisingly strategic for its size and I personally enjoy slamming the coins on the table a lot. 

Eventually it's now maybe a little more of a gimmick for me to carry it around and it's nothing that I'd bring out at gamenight maybe also due to the small size, but the game is actually very solid and the idea behind it gets a big plus from me.

I have this unhealthy obsession with looking for games that have some sory of depth and decision making, in the smallest form factor. No idea why.

Based on one play: I am impressed with what can be done with so few components. Simply take of of each coin that you have (they go form one to four) and toss them in the air. The ones that land your side up determine how many actions you have and which ones you can do. The goal is to control the board and smaller numbers can be placed on top of larger ones, with the one on top controlling the area. There is even a credit card sized map to take with you and you can play with change. A nice filler.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7

I haven't got any experience with Print 'n Play games and neither do I have much experience with microgames (only having played [thing=129622][/thing]), yet I dare say that Coin Age feels like a pinnacle of game design for both genres. The game delivers a great amount of depth and tactical thinking with the bare minimum of components. The rules are written in a very clear, concise way.

There's such an elegance to the simple depth of the design, the pressure to make the right decisions ("do I place the big coin on an open space, hoping to score high points, or do I put the smaller one on top of my opponent's coin to deny him that area?"). The [i][url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_handicap_of_a_head_start]Law of the handicap of a head start[/url][/i] can be felt when you only get to throw two coins each turn because you spent your big coins so quickly, yet you now have an increased chance at throwing no matching results and getting to capture one of your opponents coins.

Coin Age is highly portable. I've put my Print 'n Play version in a ziplock baggie and which I carry around smallest compartment of my backpack all the time. You don't need a lot of room to play either, so you can basically play the game anywhere (very useful on long train rides - though you might want to tone down the way in which you smack the coins onto the table if you don't like angry looks from the other passengers... :modest: ). The short playing time makes the a great game to play during coffee or lunch breaks, if you're lucky enough to find a gaming-minded coworker that is. Something to keep in mind, by the way,  is that this is a stricly 2-player game.

But the small size (and probably the Print 'n Play quality of my copy) might turn off some gamers. My girlfriend Amber, for example, initially turned Coin Age down because it barely looked and felt like a game (point of reference: [thing=36218][/thing] currently is her favorite game and the one by which all others get measured).

Be that as it may, this easily explained, simple-yet-challenging game is a gem I'm very happy to have discovered this year. I highly recommend you to print out the map, gather some coins and start playing Coin Age!

Cool little game, but nothing to take seriously. It actually fits perfectly in the niche of something to do when rules are being explained to a game that you are already familiar with. Normally you just sit there and fiddle with your phone, chit-chat, or get bored. Well, Coin Age can make that time so much more enjoyable. That and restaurants will actually get this little game played quite a bit, I hope. It's a perfect fit for situations like that.

Because I'm cheap and have lots of stuff lying about, I'm using a hodgepodge of coins for this - the best ones for the 1s I found are simply 1 Eurocent coins - cheap enough as you only need 8. For the others, I used old coins from long past vacations that are invalid by now. I think I have East German (GDR/DDR) 1 Mark coins (really light, probably filled with cardboard) for the 4, and Hungarian Forint/Heller coins for 3 and 2.

All with stickers, of course.

RATING: 5
There's a nice idea here, but the end game just hits me as being so unsatisfying that it lets the experience down badly. Quick to play, easy to teach and learn, portable. Just not much actual thinking required. The player going last always triggers the end (hence why they go last), for the win. So it's a bit of a tussle to avoid your opponent ending it. Hope for the best for a capture or a move if you're behind. The mechanism before all that I find nicely streamlined and neat. It just needs something where a bit more brain power is required. Or, for some this might be the prefect cafe game.

Coin Age is a game that literally fits in your wallet. In itself a brilliant concept, and wonderfully executed as well.

Playing it, we found that it is a surprising fun little game. It doesn't take long, and while you are quite dependent on how many coins you can put out on the map, jockying for position is a nice experience.

Games are over quick, so usually a lot of back-to-back plays can be done. Also, it doesn't take up a lot of space, so it can be played anywhere: your lunchbreak, during airport waiting, in the train or anywhere you have a few minutes to spare.

Brilliant concept, neat little game. Keeper.

[SEP 2016] Found another drawback of this game. Because of its size, it is easy to get lost. Or to become hard to find when you've forgot where you stacked it :'D. Currently I have NO idea where my copy is.

[APR 2017] Onitama has replaced it as the quick filler with my son and Love Letter has replaced the 'portable game' slot. Found it so now I can trade it.

Cheap to make, small enough to carry in your pocket, teachable in a couple of minutes, and very quick to play.  Deeper play than one might initially think from looking at the components.  Worth making, and fun enough for repeat plays.  Worth making several so you'll always have one to give away.  It can be a bit addictive.

And when they are available to buy, buy a few!  Or a lot!  Support clever designers.

Ended up watching the Dice Tower review and read some forum discussions because the instructions were less than clear, an inauspicious start. The game itself was quick and (mostly) straightforward but I noticed my husband's frustration at my seeming runaway win (20 to 10) :shake: so I am not sure how much *he's* in love with it. Too short to feel much involvement one way or another re winning or losing though. Appreciate the different map options.

I'm really tiring of games that a) don't have a definite end b) are under developed Kickstarter games.

Coin Age is both of those.

None of the actions are deeply interested and the game is pretty forgettable. Cheap =/= value.

I don't know what to think about this one. It's obviously not trying to be a heavy game. There are certainly decisions to be made, but the relative depth still seems low. There are better games that fit into the same short time-frame even if the portability factor is quite high with this one.

Cute, if not exactly something I want to play all the time.  A pleasant diversion good for the lulls in a big weekend of gaming.

And oh, the puns.  I can't decide if they should raise or lower my rating, so we'll just ignore them.

Edit: Growing on me.  There's a lot more strategy in this little package than meets the eye, and for such a portable and quick little game I think I'll be exploring it for many years and in a lot of different setting.

Just not a very good game. Most of the time you will have the option to add two coins to the board, but you might randomly have slightly different options based literally on the flip of a coin. I like the novelty in the use of coins and the truly micro size of the game (one card and some coins), but the game itself is just not compelling.

TMG is really carving out a niche in terms of games that are small, successful on Kickstarter, but ultimately mediocre (Dungeon Roll, Harbor, Coin Age). A strange niche to be pursuing.

Sold.

[thing=146130][/thing] is a micro-game of area control for two players and it works in the following way: each player has 10 coins in four different sizes. In his turn, the player takes one coin of each size and shakes them in the hand before slapping the coins in the table. Depending on the amount of heads and tails the player has a different set of actions to do:
- place coin: in an empty area or above other (bigger) coin;
- move coin: can move a stack of coins (or a single coin if this one is the only one in the area) to an adjacent and empty area;
- capture coin: take the top-most coin of an area to your bank.

Areas are controled by coins, but control can change, as a smaller coin can be placed above a bigger coin - the coin that controls the area is always the top-most of the stack (for instance: if you opponent controls an area with a nickel, you can put a penny or a dime above it and take control of the area).

The game ends as soon as someone places a coin in the last empty space of the board or when one of the players is out of coins - whichever happens first. The players will receive points accordingly to the areas he controls with which type of coin (controlling an area with a dime is worth 1 VP, with a penny is worth 2 VP and so on). If the player has the control of a region, the points he gets by the areas he controls are doubled. Finally, each coin still in the bank of the player are worth 1 VP. The winner is the player with the most victory points.

The game plays fast, it is easy to teach, while shake the coins and slap them in the table are almost a dexterity-game-fun on itself! [thing=146130][/thing] provides a nice set of options every turn - not really crazy hard ones, but enough to made you ponder for a little while, like: should you place 2 coins? If you do, not only where but also which size? If you ran out of a size of coins, your options also start to dimish, but you could risk going with only one or two types, and starting capturing coins left and right. Also, it is possible to gain more points taking hold of a region than battling everywhere.

It is, indeed, a good amount of game in such a small footprint (some coins and one card). Is also nice that the game is available as a free PnP, [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/93682/coin-age-print-play]right here on BGG[/url]. The easiest PnP I have ever done!

Will everyone like [thing=146130][/thing]? No, of course not. Not game will ever be. But, if you don't, you can use the change to buy some candy and use the card, if you printed it in a nice cardstock, as a geek-coaster. You can even start some conversations around it!

I sure enjoy my plays so far, so I will use bills for the candy, as one cannot stay away from candy all the time. Or is that no one can lie about everything all the time?... Hum, no, the candy thing seems more proper and wholesome.

Anyway, play it.

My short review (in english) is [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1099182/coin-age-short-review]here[/url].

***

After more plays we found what maybe a problem (for us, it is): the player that makes the final move always won - we usually save bigger coins for the last move, and even if the last coin(s) isn't(aren't) able to win a region, the points always made a difference. I'm guess that there is a way to counter this, but we haven't found it out yet.

Coin age is small and light. It's tough to tell how much strategy there is after two plays. However, you can digest it in pretty small bites, so I'll continue to try and figure it out. By the time I know whether I really like it or not, I'll have easily gotten 5 dollars worth out of the game... and I didn't even have to buy it.

Remarkable little have in a tiny package.  Many of the choices are obvious, and there's more luck than skill, but there's nothing about this that isn't fun.  In the end, it's the concept--a game for in your wallet-- that wins you over.

Thus far, with only a few plays, Coin age is rated at a 4. While I can sense some strategy behind each decision, the coin toss seem to introduce a random element of luck. However, one rule is important in this game and is frequently overlooked: that is, the option to place any coins, even though you are allowed by the rules, is entirely optional. This rule, if properly played, can create some interesting strategies. However, since my initial games were played incorrectly, the luck of the coin toss became overwhelming. Still, I could see one scenario happening: if I could place coins optionally, I may be tempted to just continually place the smallest denomination in order to gain area majority. This game deserves a few more plays before any rating is given.

After a few more plays, the game is just ok, but gets boring really fast. I mean, how many times can you slap the coins on the table and get a thrill from it?

This is a clever little game with a unique "action points" mechanism that I haven't seen before.

A good game and an exceptional value. Initially I was not so sure about the stickers included in the package (there are cardboard coins as well), but after sticking them onto some small change (1; 2; 5 and 20 €-Cents) I LOVE them.
The game itself...well, it is the smallest game you might think of, so the gameplay cannot be super deep. All in all it is OK.

This is a magnificent little game. If all microgames were like this, microgames could be around forever. It doesn't feel like a redux of another game. It doesn't feel silly, too short, etc. This is the only form in which this game makes sense, but it is totally worth playing. Innovative, clever, and suspenseful. Just beware that it can invite analysis paralysis (which is a good indicator that there is substance in this game).

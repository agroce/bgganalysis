GAME: Risk: The Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition
RANK: 1705
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good change from Classic Risk. The map makes the game more interesting - It's 50% larger and the strongholds and sites of power add a lot. It's too bad that it only comes with 4 armies.

RATING: 7
Rating based on 1 (unfinished play) of a 4 player "team" variant.
We took 3 hours to not finish and there was probably at least an hour left of play.  Two newbies playing which certainly slowed the game down.
I had a lot of fun and one of the newbies kept saying "I love this game".

RATING: 6
Much better than traditional Risk IMO.

For Trade
Condition is acceptable. Box shows heavy wear/splitting corner. 
The ring is missing. Does not affect play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1.5
Low card trade-in values ensure that no one gets too much armies for card trade-ins (may be less chaotic, but makes the game drag on until the ring ends it).  Looks kind of like LotR, but a play doesn't portray the books/movies very well. The bad guys have a decided advantage in starting territories, which may be thematic, but seems more like an unfair advantage since good and bad guys have no other differences (not even in winning conditions). The way the ring ends the game sounds nice (because the game actually ends), but ends up making the winner very nearly completely random (since no one knows when the game will end for sure, so they just land grab, hoping that their turn is the last one).

If you like Risk and Lord of the Rings, you might like it, since it's basically regular Risk with a cheap high-fructose-corn-syrupy LotR flavor. The theme is not well implemented and the board is ugly.

RATING: 6
My second favorite version of risk. I love the variable game length and that it doesn't take itself as seriously as War of the Ring. But I don't play alliances. There can be only one winner.

RATING: 9
This is certainly the best version of Risk. I rate it highly for these reasons:

1) Simple mechanics with some depth of strategy
2) Immersive experience
3) Gorgeous artwork
4) Timeless theme

Risk obviously has its weaknesses; dice rolls can wreck you at any time. But it also has a simplicity that makes it timeless.

+ The search for the ring adds another layer into an otherwise basic game.
- In the end, it's still just Risk.


Why it's previously-owned:
We used to play this a lot before discovering BGG. Since learning about other games with a bit more going on, we've never looked back. 
I traded this away for Starship Catan.

A vast improvement on regular Risk, but it's still just Risk. When a game like War of the Ring is out there, it's hard to be interested in this one.

If you're an LOTR geek, you'll love this game.  Instead of fleeing to Australia, you'll be manning the walls of Mordor! Great pieces and fun variant of Risk.

Too many reinforcements. more is not always better. there needs to be a little more restraint in this game. with so many figures on the board single battles go to long and become menotnus.

In my opinion better than the original Risk, and better than the first edition of LotR Risk. The 3 new regions add the missing elements from the original LotR.

RATING: 3
The fact that the moving ring provides for a definite end-time for the game, and the Tolkeinesque theme generally, makes this a major improvement on standard Risk. However, seeing as how Evil can suddenly end the game with a single roll of a pair of dice, the horrid luck element of the original is now magnified.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Upgraded my original version through Hasbro Customer Service.  The basic rules essentially just make the game longer, but I'd like to try the Team variant, where Evil tries to find the ring.

RATING: 7
Large improvement on basic Risk, although it still features combats determined by dice, which drives some people bonkers.  (I don't mind that at all.)  The ring is a nice game mechanic to make sure the game doesn't drag on forever.

better than risk, but not by a lot. There is some shifting map focus which is quite enjoyable.

My version is VERY beat up.

RATING: 7
This manages to be a very tumultuous game of Risk, and as a fan of LotR (books and movies), I enjoy the elements of the story that the event cards add - both when they match the original or differ wildly ("Eowyn's helping the Orcs? Cool!")

Great Game. Very fun to play.

The only change I've made is when you roll for the ring to fall into Mount Doom (and end the game), you have to roll a 6 (not more than 3). This prevents final round suicides that end up winning the game.

Was my favorite game for over a decade.  Love Risk and find the expanded Middle Earth board to be a more strategic and fun setting for Risk.  We preferred to play by the old Risk rules as compared to the Path of the Ring way so our games were always longer, but have always been some of my favorite gaming experiences from college.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.4
A great Risk variant, more interesting than the original game, with lovely components, card action, even comes with a replica One Ring. The board is detailed and quite attractive. A perfect thrift buy for $4, and though I will keep the original for nostalgia's sake, it is unlikely I'd play it again over this re-themed revision.

Pretty fun, Played this one quite a bit. Now just a tad long with kids all around in our group and i always seemed to be on the losing team! Very open map without the bottle necks of standard risk. LOTR adds to the standard game in complexity but also in depth. Ladies liked the standard FFA points game but not the Good vs. Evil game. Added some custom cards instead of the fellowship type cards to spice it up some more.

Risk meets LotR. Basically the same Risk on a new board! However, there are leaders to help you in battle and certain cards that can grant Powers (Under the Mountain) lets you attack under a mountain range; (None shall Pass) closes one river crossing for a turn....
Still Risk but with some interesting and fun editions.

RATING: 8
This is the most fun version of Risk I've played.  There are some problems with it, though.  Even using the One Ring as a sort of timer mechanic, it's by far the longest playing Risk game.  Also, the winner is basically decided by whoever's turn it is when the ring reaches Mount Doom, and they know they can just march across the board without fear of reprisal.  However, conquering Middle Earth is far more fun than conquering regular, future, or mythological Earth--for what reason I don't know.

This is actually a really fun version of Risk.  It elimnates one of the biggest problems of vanilla risk, namely the interminable two-player slug-fest that the game inevitably devolves into, by imposing  a timer (in the form of Frodo's journey to Mt. Doom) which players can influence for strategic advantage.  The theme is also well handled.

These days, though, I'd advise playing either War of the Ring or vanilla Risk instead.

THIS is the Middle-Earth edition to have, since it exapnds the game to six players and completes the map of Middle-Earth. Remarkably well-done RISK variant set in Middle-Earth and covering aspects of the book and the film. Of note is the decision by the designer and publisher to make the trek of the Fellowship determine the length of the game. That certainly lightens the burden of learning the game while keeping the scale of the game and flavor of the theme intact.

Another decent variation on the Risk theme. Along with Risk:2210, they are the best face-lifts of an entry level wargame I've seen in a while. The option to play as Fellowship versus Shadow, or last man standing, gives good replayability and both versions have their appeal.

I think technically it belonged to my brother, but he long since stopped caring. I have it in my collection and when I was playing the print-and-play version of Tiny Epic Kingdoms it was actually really fun to use the little mini plastic soldier pieces from this game (since they were on horses and such.) We lost the "one ring" a long time ago though.

Update: 2 of the 4 box corners have been chewed on by a puppy, ha! Happily he didn't get to any of my favorite games, so I don't mind that he chewed this one. Makes it nearly impossible to trade now though, whoops.

RATING: 3
Better than normal Risk because it has a timer but at a certain point you have to start rolling the die to see if the timer progresses or not. If your like me and don't like base Risk, this just leads to "Noooo another round!?". Our game took 5 hours but I have had more fun in a 5 minute game of Love Letter. People, Risk is just awful. Please go play Small World instead.

Much more fun than regular risk. Still need about 2-3 hours to play out, thus cannot rate it higher. But I do like the ring track that keeps the game play time under 3 hours, while providing flexibility to extend or delay the final turn approaching.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is so much better than standard Risk.  It's great fun (if very heavy on the die rolls) but not so hot as a 2-player -- unless he's awesomely unlucky, whoever goes first wins.  Cool as a 4-player team game, with the forces of Sauron hunting for the One Ring.  Lots of theme in the adventure cards too.  Cool game.

Decent game.  Only played with 2 player teams where the game ends when the evil side finds the ring.  Two main problems with this game: 1) standard Risk issue of offense gets an large advantage over defense.  It seems too hard to hold a line or any particular territory. 2) LOTR team problem.  Since you each team member plays seperately its hard to control entire regions.  We house-ruled that team members could surrender territories to each other.

If I am going to play a version of Risk, this is it.  The map is glorious, tight and beautiful.  The rules variation from vanilla is great and I love that units already start on the board.  I love the various win conditions.  I would rather play War of the ring, but this is (usually) quicker and a little more friendly to non-hardcore gamers.  This game has seen much love over the years with my non board gaming friends!

It's Risk. I haven't any of the variants (in this edition). But having not played play any flavor of Risk in a LONG time, it did remind me of how fun a simple game can be. The cards can be a bit unbalancing, though. Which I guess is part of the favlor of Risk, and especially LoTR.

I also had to buy this when I first saw it, likely in Zellers for about $30.  This time they included the entire map of Middle Earth.  I felt a bit ripped off that they didn't just publish this version, but I guess the first game acted as a preview.
I love the team aspect of the game.  You have a partner, but whoever scores better within the partnership is the game winner.
The game can be over very very quickly if the ring happens to be captured in the first few plays, but it typically lasts the full length.

RATING: 8
Make the last space of the track (a die) a 'once around the table' turn. Then, you should definitely add this rule: everyone's point total is frozen after his/her turn. The highest total directly after their final turn wins the game.

Otherwise it's turn after turn of attacking the leader until the ring is dunked. No fun at all.

New cards, Middle Earth theme, cool miniatures!

LOTR Risk has to be one of the best movie tie-in games. The ring moves from the Shire to Mount Doom, limiting the length of Risk (which is a good thing IMO). Playing on the map of Middle Earth is cool, and helps players better grasp the geography behind the books and movies. And the event cards bring additional actions that make the game richer and deepen the connection to the films. It's all good. If you like Risk and LOTR, you will probably like this game a lot. If you don't, you won't.

Look at my comment of Risk too.

Bought two copies of Risk - The Lord of the Rings - Trilogy Edition at Wal-Mart for 10 bucks each.

Why bother with this one when there are more complex type of wargames out there. The different versions of Risk would be more interesting than the original or this one included. I mean, I played it also and oh my god! I wonder why I expected something really different than the original. I think I would prefer playing the original than this version of Risk with the mission variant.

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time.

Beautiful artwork. Map of middle-earth.

Played once. Not sure I would want to play it again.

One of the two copies I gave as a gift to my nephew. The other copy I SOLD IT.


Sold my other copy to a co-worker.

I've only played it 2-player.  It's a fairly decent adaptation of the Risk mechanics to the LOTR story.  With 2 players you definitely need to impose a limit on the number of armies a player can have in a region - otherwise the balance will start to tip quickly in favor of one player or the other.

RATING: 5
Probably the first time I've enjoyed Risk in YEARS.  Nice theme, more to it than "roll dice, total domination", the mission cards add unpredictability, completing the missions gives you something else to strive for...a nice design, really.  The ring mechanic in particular is very nice, though it is really tough for the Shadow player to find the ring.

My only complaint is that for a game this light, it should not take 3 hours to complete (which this one does).  The only knock on what I feel is a great casual, light wargame with the LOTR flavor.


UPDATE:  Bumped from 7 to 5.  The length of this game is KILLER.  If I have 3  hours, why wouldn't I just play War of the Ring?  And if I have 4-5, why wouldn't I just play 2210 or Clone Wars Risk?

I keep this one mainly because of the gorgeous map and nice bits.  I may have to use these for Wizard's Quest someday...those Orcs would add some 3D to the game.

Risk is one of those games I have to be careful whom to play with. Playing with the wrong person will make the game take forever or severely reduce the enjoyment. However, when played with the right individual(s), this edition is fantastic. The map is HUGE, well balanced, and the various action/event cards take basic Risk to a whole new lever.

From a pure enjoyment perspective, I rate this an 8. However, it gets severely reduced in rating simply for the fact that the game is, still, a little long; also, it is not a game suitable for every player or group.

Fought over a map of Middle Earth, more "continents", leaders, fortresses, rivers and bridges, quest cards, variable but finite game length, all add renewed interest to a faded classic.

Being a fan of Risk and LOTR it doesn't get too much better than this. However it's not just because I like the two - the game is designed well enough and has variants that make it a good game.  I think if it was just Risk with LOTR characters I wouldn't rate it this high - but with the variations and the GREAT map it stands alone a very good game.

This is much better than the original Risk. I especially like the fact that trading in cards always results in the same small number of additional battalions, not a progressively larger number that tilts the original game too drastically. I also like the tie to the theme, including the fellowship movement of the ring towards its destruction. Finally, I like the point system for determining a winner, if the ring gets destroyed, and I like the adventure cards that make minor modifications to the normal game flow. I have only played this 3-handed; it is still a rather long game, but enjoyable.

May 2009 -- I do not own this game, but have enjoyed playing it a few times.

RATING: 7.5
Much better than expected.  Risk seems to translate nicely to a LotR environment.  But ... the game is a little long (with a slower than needed setup) and some aspects (adventure cards, sites of power, and missions) certainly don't fit "seamlessly" into the overall gameplay pattern.  Even after a few plays (fun), players seem to forget key aspects or make incorrect plays (uhh, I have too many cards ... oops, I forgot to conquer a site of power, so no adventure card ... did we move the fellowship last turn?).

RATING: 7
Bought while at University (early 2000s). I still enjoy vanilla Risk, but I love how creative and different some of the franchise spin-offs have been - way better for the hobby than just endlessly re-skinning [thing=1406][/thing].

I prefer this over vanilla Risk. It feels more balanced, and there's more of a narrative. But it really only works well with 4 players, and for the last few years I've always had plenty of other games I'd prefer to play with four.

Sold in November 2017.

Well it's not War of the Ring; but with that obvious point made, it's also not bad  for what it is: a simple themed game of Risk.  Risk is a classic and fun for younger, more inexperienced players.  I don't believe in rating a game low just because it's too acessible.  It deserves a solid 7... it's playable, nice flavour with the theme, and sticks to the basics of Risk.  Buy it for kids 10-14 as an introduction too big time games; then hit them with WotR :-)

Me and my cousins LOVE this game and play it regularly.  Definitely one of my favorite board games.  Who'd have thought you could take an already perfect classic like Risk and make it even better?  My favorite mode is the one wear the bad guys have to find the ring while the good guys try to clear a path for it to safely get to mount doom.  This feature adds a lot depth and strategy that's not in the basic Risk game, and also makes you feel like you're actually in Middle Earth during the War of the Ring.  Brilliant game.

The movement of the ring introduces a welcome ticking clock to basic risk, and having to keep one eye on the ring while going about the usual Risk-style military business improves on basic Risk a bit. Some Middle Earth flavor here but you'll see more sweeping campaigns and the fall of more strongholds than Tolkien ever envisioned.

My favorite of the Risk games.  I like the LOTR theme.  The large board and additional rules help to create variety without compromising game flow.  The evil player(s), however, usaully start with an advantage, due to the consolidation of forces and number of fortresses - if the evil players don't beat each other up, they hold an advantage. The random game length, however, can be both exciting and frustrating.

Finally!  A variant of Risk that isn't the old game with a different map/piece models.  The leaders, event cards, Ringbearer mechanic, and fortresses add a lot of needed depth to a game that is essentially all luck (anyone who's lost an invasion of a territory because you 15 armies were wiped out by 2 defenders can attest to this!).  More than the other variants I've played, this seems to capture the feel of the theme used, in this case the LotR.

Thrift find. 
Unplayed. 

2-4 players. 

Plays best with 3. 

2 players isn't great, although not terrible.

Just a note about ending LOTR Risk (where it's last person gets the advantage). All you have to do is when the ring is about to fall into the fires of Mount Doom, instead of having to roll 4+ make it have to be a 6. That way, the ring can perch on the edge of destruction for a couple turns and no one knows who's going to have the last turn.

RATING: 9
This is maybe the game that has given me the most pleasure of all and would deserve a straight 10 if measured in the fun my friends and I got out of it. After playing Classic Risk through countless nights in my uni times this was definitely a step up with the concept of victory points, strongholds (give +1 defending advantage), leaders (provide +1 in attack and defence) and a defined game time.  If all players know how to play and you play with 4 players - the more players the faster - it still takes 3.5-4hrs in my experience. Some people say it has too much luck and randomness built-in which I dispute as you role the dice so often during a game that over the whole game it pretty much evens out mathematically I found.  Some also say that advancing with your armies across the entire board in one turn is unrealistic in real life, which it is indeed, however, that's a tactical thing you have to watch as you not only can quickly over-expand as nothing is restraining you but also because you can't back-track. On the other hand it provides you with unlimited options. I identified two small issues with the game (which lead to 9 rather than 10 points):

1. It lacks the usual Risk problem that the person who starts has an advantage (-0.3pts) and
2. In the final turn everybody goes for broke and the lucky last person having a massive advantage (-0.7pts)

If you don't like the Lord of the Rings theme I suggest you deduct another point and if you couldn't stand the Classic Risk I suggest you deduct another 2 points (or better keep your hands off it as the basic concept is still the same).

Having played the original Risk, Clone Wars Risk, Transformers Risk, Risk Godstorm, and Risk 2210 A.D.

Captains are included, the map is well-balanced, and the theme is integrated well. If you like Risk and Lord of the Rings, this is a no-brainer.

As I was playing this game, it was all right because I'm a big LOTR fan.  But there were huge swings of control over the last few turns.

Maybe I'd play it again, but War of the Ring sounds way better to me.

For trade purposes: One corner of the box is dented and there are scuffs here an there around the box.  As a whole it still looks decent.

Of the 360 pieces that come with the game there are only 3 pieces missing out of the entire game.  1 black black-rider (counts as 3 men), 1 red orc and 1 green archer. This should in no way effect the game.  The cards are in excellent condition and all are accounted for.

A sentimental rating of course. We combined parts of the first Lord of the Rings game with this one, working on making the deck more balanced. We had numerous house rules, that in my opinion, made it such a great gaming experience. 
For example, when attacking, triple sixes gave you an extra kill. Double sixes on defense, you GAINED an army, lose NONE. To even that out though, if you roll double ones, you LOSE 3. Remember, this is all before I learned about board games.

The best version of Risk out there! (Although coming from a LOTR fan) The addition of strongholds, leaders and power cards is genius and adds a lot of interest to the usual Risk die rolling.  The power cards are a mix of mini missions with a reward, and neat effects on combat or movement. The fellowship - nicely represented by a One Ring replica - acts as a great way of ensuring the game has a definite end point.  We like to play with the ring searching variant.  Best with four players, although I have played more with two which still works ok.  (With two players Good should start rather than Evil)  Three players can be unbalanced due to the psychology of two of the three representing the forces of good.

The bottom of the board is just uninteresting and pretty much perfectly defensible by the evil players.  It is cool that it sets up a giant battle in front of the gates of Mordor, but the extra length and the strategic problems of the bottom of the board make this one less interesting than the non-trilogy edition, for me.  The non-trilogy edition also plays faster, having significantly fewer ring spaces.

The event cards and time-limit of the Ring's journey are great improvements, but it's still a Risk game, so there's a ton of dice rolling and heavy reinforcement swings that can get a little frustrating.

This game is as enjoyable as other Risk editions with the same basic gameplay, augmented by the addition of "commander" units that boost armies in their territory, and a One Ring mechanic that acts as a time limit as the Ring in question moves toward Mount Doom. Once it reaches the end of its path and is successfully thrown in, the game is over and the state of the board is assessed to determine the winner. The four armies come in pairs, two heroic armies and two villainous armies, allowing for a team-up game mode as well.

Nice improvment on the standard Risk! game.  I've enjoyed Risk! as a "beer and pretzel" game, but it's too shallow.  This version adds enough to kick it close to "I'll never turn down a game".

RATING: 6
I unapologetically love Risk, even if it's a bit one-dimensional, unbalanced, and has a tendency to test the fabric of friendships.

That's why I fell in love with this game on first play and played it obsessively for years following. This is Risk made better with the minor modification of adding leaders, plus the dynamic of the board and its forts, and finally with some card choices. I didn't often play with the Ring-to-Mount-Doom dynamic because I was otherwise so satisfied with it as Risk!

Of course, it's still Risk: an hours-long affair with much turtling that ends with massive armies sweeping out all of the minor players. The newer class of games that cropped in the intervening decade brought a lot more nuance to this sort of dynamic, which in hindsight makes LOTR: Risk seem a little less novel and fun. 

I say, screw that. I think its permanent spot on my shelf is well-deserved, even if I don't play it as often these days.

It's risk on a different map. While fun to play in middle earth, it really doesn't change much. The idea of point system makes for more objectives but ultimately every time we play it gets down to the ring being on the last space, then if the final ring movement fails the next person has the chance to push all troops as far as possible and win the game IF the ring moves again... basically whoever had the last turn before the ring moves off the map will inevitably win. Eh, not for me.

If someone insists on playing Risk, might as well play this.  Length limiting mechanic (path of the ring going to mordor), cute theme (lotr), a little variety thrown in (cards) and yet, still the same solid mechanic, gameplay and balance.  I'm not strong on wargames, but this is ok.  I like Twilight Imperium over this, but this Risk is shorter and more casual.

RATING: 9.5
Fascinating Risk-based treatment of the Ring Trilogy which improves on the original Risk in many ways. I find it very tough for the good guys to win and it can be challenging finding your way around the map, even for those who've read LOTR 75 times or more. Strongly recommended to the Tolkien enthusiasts out there, every game I've played has been great fun.

Good RISK game, feels somewhat like LOTR and fun to play.  What more can I ask?  War of the Ring is the definitive LOTR boardgame these days - there really is no comparison between the two.  But this one is very good and fun in it's own right.

The sheen has worn off, even with the theme, I'm not loving this one now. This has a lot to do with the fact that [GameID=10383] turned out to be fun, much better than this, and suits me well for the occasional beer-n-pretzel war-boardgame fix.

Most people think that this game is just another market produced item from the movies and has no creativity such as a monopoly games with a Star Wars franchise. I disagree and think that the LOTR Risk Trilogy Edition has changed the tactics, gameplay, and almost every aspect of the original game. I own 2 Original Risk board games and have been a fan of both Risk and the LOTR books. I was more motivated by this Risk edition than any other. The Original Risk I would give a 6 and I give LOTR Risk a 9.

Fun for a bit, but the game drags on too long and it is too luck dependent, as all Risk games are.  The adventure card system gives it a nice variation and more tactical depth than regular Risk, and the Fellowship movement forces the game to end at some point, but not enough to overcome the random dice rolling combat mechanic and length.  It is a nice diversion, but just shows how much better War of the Ring is when you need a Tolkien war game.

The Triology Edition improves upon the original edition by adding a complete map and more event cards.  The good versus evil variant is much more interesting then just playing for points, but the game is still Risk.  The game requires too much setup and time to play which lowers my rating.

Played 3 or 4 times before logging plays.

I finally played Risk LOTR after so long.  The setup phase is tedious, but after that it flows well.  The ring moving on the board act like a timer, wich is a GOOD thing with Risk.  The components are good and the board gorgeous.  I could play again with the right group, but because of the total randomness and long play time, I like other games better to scratch the 'territory conflict' itch.  Still happy to have it in my collection.

I grew up playing this game in high school with my friends.  We thought it was the coolest and most complicated board game on the planet.  We mostly get it out for nostalgic purposes now.  I still prefer it to regular Risk.  The only real problem with the game is that when playing the good vs. evil version, evil can abruptly win by finding the ring at an early stage of the game (highly anti-climactic).

Bought the original edition and then the expansion that made it into the Trilogy edition.  So I have a ton of extra pieces between the two sets.  I truly enjoy this version of risk more than original.  It adds a lot more strategy and fun. My only rule when playing the orcs:  I Must Have Mordor!!!  You'll have to ask my friend Chris about that...

Theme heavy, well done board, as well as implementing different accessibility routes/boarders.  Not sure if I like the leaders' dice modifying mechanic.

The good version, with the southern part of the continent mapped.

I really like this version, as it adds some great elements to keep things interesting, and gives you a time limit/goal in the movement of the ring.  Plus, the missions add another dimension of strategy, as does following the ring.  Can end VERY abruptly, though.    

Make sure you take the Mines of Moria early on, fellowship or bad guys alike.  It will make your life easier.

I don't know why this version of Risk gets so much love. I found it merely okay. The pieces are all really cool, but the game just feels like Risk with a really early time limit cap on the whole thing. You can't really get much accomplished before the Ring makes it to Mordor, so this just feels like it's all about either moving that piece there or stopping it. Just play War of the Ring if you want to experience a Risk version of LOTR.

Like all Risk games it has a very long set up. If you are playing the regular conquer the world mode you will find that players will stack up (good forces) Minis Tirith and the (Evil Forces) Black Gates, this is because two cards in the deck allow for I believe a 15 troop deployment at MT and a 10+ Troop deployment at BG.. Multiple occasions me and friends played where the game would devolve into a true Cold war of empires sabre rattling at each other with 60+ strong armies situated on these two points. refusing to budge because the risk was too great of losing either area. 

My remedy for this was once the card has been played it is set asides until the next game. This allows MT and BG to be powerful spots as defensive territories but won't promote bunkering down there simply to recieve a massive influx of troops over and over and over.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent version of Risk that is best played with 4 players to truly get the most out of the game.  The variant of the forces of Good protecting the ring on its journey vs. the forces of Evil trying to capture the ring is something that must be experienced to really appreciate the mix of gameplay and subject matter.

My game group uses the house rule to randomly give out the territories instead of the Good and Evil teams always having the same starting locations to really give it a different feel each time we play.

RATING: 5.5
Great game plus pretty good risk variant plus theme I always love. Not best LOTR game or Risk game ever but pretty good at both. Like most game I think are good enough to own I've played it a million times.

I'm not a fan of Risk, but I do like the LotR and I thought this might be enough to win me over. Ugh. I would actually rather play vanilla Risk than this. The cards are interesting in theory, and the rules appear that things will be more strategic, but there's so much rich-get-richer going on that it destroys any enjoyment. The board is also VERY hard to read and the colors made this color-blind boy almost cry. If this ever hits the table, which I hope to campaign against, I will vote that we play regular Risk instead.

It's still RISK. I Love LOTR, but this really doesn't do it for me. the board is to hard to read, the font, authentic, but so annoying. 2210 AD is much better. It still has to high a chance for snowbaling, like clasic Risk.

RATING: 7.5
While the combat is simplistic as usual, the adventure cards, sites of power, and strongholds each add something that makes the decisions interesting. Should I use my leader to forge a path for the ring, or should I divert attention to grab more adventure cards? Should an army be used to go for a ring victory or quickly eliminate good's forces before it's dunked?

When played 2-player with the 4P team rules & the hunt for the ring, it's essentially War of the Ring lite. In our first game, the Ring was found with an against-the-odds roll of "10" with a +2 bonus while in Moria. Seemed tilted toward evil, but then again I played horribly. Lots of room for trying different wacky strategies. 

War of the Ring is filled with nuance, and that's great. When you want to play through the books/movies while shutting down many parts of your brain, this is the way to go. Buckets o' dice and tons of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's a great version of risk, specially if you like lotr. The map is great and well designed, and way better than the other lotr smaller map. As any risk, is has a lot of luck involved, just as much as strategy, but if that's ok with you then it will be always a fun game to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Had higher hopes for the special scenario. It's a bit too luck based. Either the evil side will luck out and get an easy win or the good guy side can just sit around and not die. Nice map varient if you just want to play Risk though.

First off, I have to say that I like this version of Risk a whole lot better than the original.  The Lord of the Rings theme makes it ever so much more interesting for me.

A very fun and cool Risk variant over the map of Middle Earth. Battles ensue while the one ring treks along. Game ends when the ring reaches Mt. Doom. A good variant is playing with 2 teams of good vs. evil.

The Trilogy edition is worth obtaining over the original 2002 LOTR release.

I hope to obtain a copy of the Expansion to the earlier Risk LOTR so I can mix in those cool extra pieces.

I definitely prefer it to regular Risk.  The Ring aspect makes the game a more manageable length (although it's not atypical for one of us to conquer everything before the Ring is destroyed) and creates added suspense.

It does seem weighted towards the evil players, but it hasn't ever been too overwhelming and provides a little extra character to the game.

This was my game of choice for a long time.  As a fan of both risk and LOTR, it was a must have.  Then I found War of the Ring, and well... there's just no turning back from that one.  Still, the game is very fun.  The strongholds and strategy cards can be both a curse and a blessing.  They're fun, but also makes the game difficult to conquer.  Sometimes a basic game of risk is a nice throw back to the simple game.

Why play Fantasy Flight's gaudy, overly-complex, scripted War of the Ring when LOTR-Risk is an option?

RATING: 7
Lord of the Rings Risk is so much more than regular Risk.  It's actually one of the better Tolkein board games out there as well.  Things I like: The addition of leaders, strongholds, adventure cards as well as a built end timing mechanism (the ring) to make sure the game will end. What I don't like: the fact that in multiplayer, good can be fighting good (hard to imagine this), even with the built in timing mechanism, a game can last 3 or more hours (mainly because they're so many places with the new board where you have to roll the die to move the ring).

Note: Especially good to play, then watch one of the movies for an all day, recurring event.

The map for this game is superb and makes it a favourite in our household as everyone loves to battle for Middle Earth. Rules need some tweaking to ensure allies don't have to battle each other, but that's easily fixed. Team play is the only way to play this game, with the One Ring slowly making its way to Mt Doom. My only complaint is the choice of figures. Eagles and Black Riders were never so common in the story and should not have been used as common pieces (maybe as Hero pieces instead?). Plus Dwarves neglected completely. Oh well can't have everything I suppose.

Never a huge fan of RISK.  This map is much more involving...using rivers, mountains, etc.--plus places of power and strongholds.  I like the "fixed" reinforcements for turning in books/sets of cards, rather than the progressive approach.  I love the map--it looks a lot like the original "Tolkien approved" maps but is difficult to read with the dark small lettering on the dark colored territories.  Ah, well...accurate, but hard on the eyes.  Nice components...rules need some clarifying (e.g., when is it approrpriate to play cards in the turn order?  During team play, do cooperating teams share bonus armies for controllring regions or do they have to kill each other off?).  This game could **really** use reference cards for players, detailing turn order, regional reinforcement bonuses, numbers of battalions for turning in card sets/books, etc.  Still, such as it is, quite  a bit more entertaining than regular RISK which I would give a 5 and the LOTR factor gives it another .5 point boost.

In the alliance game where the "good" have to protect the ring to Mount Doom, it seemed the "bad" had a rather large advantage. Also, it's RISK so it still maintains some of the problems associated with that game. That said, the point system in the free for all, the timing mechanism, the strongholds, and the mission cards do much to lend complexity to an otherwise luck-driven war game.

The great theme and the great components are pushing this variant up. I also kind of like the hunt for the ring version of risk. But it has its flaws: The victory of the dark forces by die roll can be a little bit unsatisfying. It would also be nice if the players on each side could better interact with each other. It can be pretty frustrating for a team if one of them holds all but one land of a region. His ally wants to give it to him but can't, so he has to attack this land and loses 3-4 units against his ally just because of bad dice rolling.

It's okay. Best version for the Risk purists. If I wanted a departure from Risk though, I'd rather play Risk 2210. I'm a big Lord of the Rings fan, so the fact that the theme has nothing to do with the mechanics is pretty boring. Also borderline broken with 3 players. Playable only with 4 players, and you might be better off just playing something else at that point.

How many times have I seen a single troop last out against an invading horde simply because that defensive troop kept rolling high numbers?  Risk loses a lot of its strategic value due to the reliance on dice for all of the big actions.

How does the LotR trilogy version deal with this?  Well, honestly... not in any significant ways.  The board is pretty and the pieces are cool and pretending you're fighting for Middle Earth is every geek's dream... but some of the special rules only make the game more ridiculous.  For example, if the evil side owns a territory that the ring passes through on its journey, a random dice roll could end the entire game.  I mean, I get that in concept -- it is trying to mirror the story -- but it's a gimmick that every person I've played with doesn't want to use.

Is it still a cool version of Risk?  Hell yeah.  But do I want to play this when I have an actual strategy game on hand.  Nah.

It is worth noting the if you are going to get this game, make sure it's not the ridiculously half-completed "LotR Edition"; make sure you're getting the "Trilogy Edition".

RATING: 5
I have to come to terms that, despite my love for wargames, Risk has never done it for me.  It's great to play on a Middle-Earth map, but oi, that Risk set-up of placing one army at a time just drives me loopy.  Still, this one does have some  nice atmosphere going for it.

RATING: 6
Significantly better than original Risk - LOTR.  I enjoy the way the initial setup is somewhat similar each time, but with variation as well.  I find it interesting to watch games play out, whether I'm winning or not.  But in the end, it's still Risk.

It's Risk, but with some major improvements: there are far fewer choke points on the board; there is a time limit to the game (no more playing until the last man is standing); and the cards add some interesting twists to the game.  It's not perfect but it's better than the original game.

This is a much better Risk variant than the other rethemed ones that I've seen.  The very fact that the "One True Ring" travels from the Shire to Mt. Doom to end the game is a blessing.  The "Lord of the Ring" theme and other add-ons make the game very tolerable.

Like the non-trilogy LOTR version of Risk, the power swings in this game are immense and game-balance upsetting.  The new territories added don't have quite so many adjacencies as previous ones (which is good), but their addition makes the game quite a bit longer.  Like the non-trilogy LOTR risk, it's still possible for someone to get upwards of 25 armies on a turn (using a combination of card turnins, completed missions, events, territory bonuses, etc...) while the next player eeks out a mere 4.  Overall, I liked this game slightly better than the non-trilogy version, but it's still pretty awful.

This was the first board game which caused me to lay awake at night formulating strategies for my next play. Combines my love of strategic and tactical gameplay with that of a fantastic theme in LOTR. The board, cards, and miniatures are of excellent quality and contribute to the theme extremely well.

My only regret is that over the last 6 years the game seldom hit the table due to our playing the game with the standard world-domination Risk rules, which made for games of exhaustive length, which would often be called with no winner. One memorable game in my college years actually lasted upwards of 8 hours. My last play of the game was the first in which we actually played with the LOTR rules regarding the destruction of the Ring in Mt. Doom serving to end the game. That game lasted about 3 hours, including setup. Moving forward, I'm hoping to be able to play this game much more often if the average game length will fall in the 2-3 hour range. 

I've never played the Team Risk (Good vs. Evil) variation, although it sounds as if it would provide an even more immersive LOTR experience as the two sides battle to destroy or discover the One Ring.

Not sure why I like this game as much as I do. I'm a fan of LOTR so that could play a part. I really don't like the original Risk game. I guess when you add up the good things about the game: battling in Middle Earth, the ring cards, strongholds, leaders, ports that allow you get from one end of the board quicker, and the ring time limit, this makes for a pretty interesting game.  I do think it's more interesting with some house rules though.

It's [gameid=181], and suffers from many of the same problems.  That said, it's a much BETTER version of Risk.  Some of the bugs of the original have been fixed, such as the flavorless metagaming that goes on.  The addition of generals and fortresses is a great one.  A decent pickup, but not as good as [gameid=1829] or [gameid=15045].  If you play it, play with four players on teams, 2 v. 2, with the ring as a timer.  You might be surprised how even those minimal changes can improve the basic Risk mechanics.

The ring is cute too.

RATING: 8
if you like Risk then you will love this version.  Having to capture or protect the ring while it travels to Mount Doom adds a real sense of urgency and requires that you take action each turn.  As the ring moves, so does the battle which makes for very interesting strategies.  Games never drag on as can happen with regular Risk.

If you don't like Risk you won't like this game either (see my comments on Risk).

This is another solid variant of the Risk family. You can play it as the standard free-for-all or you can play a version that recreates the movie, with both sides trying to manipulate the path of the ring on it's way to Mount Doom. Both ways are fun, but be advised...If you quit playing Risk in the past because of its length, this version does run a little longer than the other modern Risk variants.

I liked several things about this game, primarily those that evoked the story: the Middle-Earth setting, the beautiful map, the interesting geography of the map, the minis, the strongholds & power locations, and the timer of the Ring’s journey.

But, those were far overcome by the things that annoyed me:
- it’s still basically Risk, with all the randomness that entails, 
- the setup time is huge (my son kept asking, “Can we get started now?” “No, there are a few more steps we need to do...”), 
- the game takes forever (4+ hours in our 2 person game), 
- the timer can be delayed via chance or people playing a card to delay it, 
- the luck of the bonus cards can set off a runaway leader (in a shortened game, there’s not enough time for the luck to even out), and
-  worst of all, the game comes down to a die roll on whether the Ring gets tossed into Mt. Doom or not. That decides who goes last, and in this game of see-saw, who wins.

I'll never play it... the enjoyment of RISK was beat out of me as a kid when I was always the youngest in the game, was never competent strategically, and was thrashed and trashed. The worst part was that it took HOURS to be be thrashed and trashed with no chance of victory. An exercise in torture for me and therefore I will never play RISK in any form again.

The second of the movie editions (following the Clone Wars version) this re-release features a beautiful board (the first, and only as of now, to feature a board fully representing something seen in the film) and great pieces that "clack" in your hand with a pleasing sound. Those looking for a middle ground between the "endless" battles of original Risk and the almost too short turn limits of the AH versions, this has a nice middle ground, featuring a nearly 20 turn limit that COULD run even longer depending on certian factors (you actually see the ring travel to Mt. Doom). New rules include strongholds, leaders, sites of power, and "missions" that can be completed during the game (by getting a leader to a certian point on the board) for extra points. In an odd move, ALL cards played, even the puny ones, net players points, so often players will find themselve gunning pointless cards to the table to run up the score. It also seems odd that it's not a team game in the four player version, as there IS a diffrence between the good and bad guys (starting zones and point values differ). OOP for a few years now, this one is getting harder to scoop up and below average prices, and while this version feels like a draft run for some later versions (a bit too much is crammed into it), it's a worthy addition.

Risk with a LOTR variant. The new optional rules they added are incomprehensible. However, the new board and peices are beautiful. Points deducted for being a dice fest and having poorly excecuted new rule variants.

If this wasn't drizzled in LoTR sauce, I would have sold the game in a heartbeat.

Play only using house rules, is my advice.

Much as I desperately want to like this game, I can't. It's fatally flawed. I keep asking myself: why play this game, when I could be playing '[i]War of the Ring[/i]' or '[i]The Battle of the Five Armies[/i]'? I just don't have a good answer.

We received this as a wedding present and just have never been in the mood to play any kind of Risk.

Much better than the original risk, adds leaders which make a huge difference in battles, and the ring movement also limits the time of the game by a substantial amount.

Only edition of Risk I somewhat enjoy. Probably because there's a limit on the amount of turns to play the game. The theme helps too.

This rating is from not playing the find the ring variation of the game yet which seems like it might improve the game. The regular game has a ring moving mechanic that is terrible. The moving of the ring through the map does nothing but decide when the game ends.  It is boring, annoying and goes right down the middle of the board. It is a quality Risk map. Too many cards relate to the ring with pretty much no effect on the game. Overall just decent because it is a Risk variation, but one of the worst ones I have played.

In a two-player game, the 'evil' player has a bit of an advantage due to Mordor, but that's okay.  A buddy of mine and I still had some great times with this game.

Would only trade if all pieces are included and box is in decent shape

Fun little game, taught to me by the publisher through a translator.  Seemingly high luck factor is mitigated by short play time (think cribbage-lite).

Simple and light partnership card game but plays quickly and is mildly addictive.

Goita is a recent discovery that has become a favorite in my home. The game is of Japanese origins and is historically played with Shogi-like pieces. That said, it's nothing like Shogi but is instead a shedding game where 4-players attempt to get rid of their pieces first. Like WW5, Goita unfortunately suffers in rank because of its requirement for four players, but it's a great game regardless.

Awesome exciting game! I would like to play this game forever!!
You can conjecture hands of other people that they play how.
Many many things can be predicted by playing.

So japanish game... in a bad ways. Where is the game? Goita is too luck-driven, "all the strategies" are too obvious, partnership-game doesn't feel partnership game at all, scoring system sucks. Yieks!

I put English index for non-Japanese players and it works fine. I really like this unique mechanics and the idea of trying to read your partner's hand. The rating could go up with more plays.

This is an interesting and quick paced partner game using shogi pieces.  Using the real shogi pieces rather than the cards makes it a lot of fun.

A relatively simple, yet interesting card game based on the tiles from Shogi. 2 pairs of players try to outbid the other pair to earn a number of points per game. The first pair to earn a certain number of points wins. 

The characters may put some non-Kanji reading players off. Replayability may not be high given its simplicity. Nonetheless, an enjoyable short filler if there are 4 players.

A very lite and easy to learn partnership game.  In order to play cards, you must match (and in certain cases "trump") the one that was laid down previously.  There is a small amount of strategy involved but is mostly dictated by the distribution of the hands dealt.  Plays fast but probably not substantial enough for long time card players.

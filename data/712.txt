GAME: Blood Bowl (Third Edition)
RANK: 245
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I love the idea behind Blood Bowl: a fantasy-themed game of american football with just the right amount of luck and tactics. Well, maybe luck can be a tad more than the "right amount" (a pretty huge tad, actually), but the point still stands: you have to build your own team and play it to its strength in a game that rewards planning and managing the risks you take with your moves. BB really shines when played in a league, to the point that I’d take one or two points away from my vote when considering a simple, one-shot game. During a league you have the chance to make your team grow, choose new skills for your players and add an intriguing management element to the standard game. 
The rules have been continuously modified since its first edition but I’m afraid that, over the years, the "football" element has taken precedence over the "fantasy" one, trying to push BB towards a more deterministic form, which is quite silly, considering the impact of luck in the game and the huge possibilities that its theme has to offer. I've been told that recently this trend seems to have changed, but I’m still waiting for the good old messy gameplay to come back on the field. It’s true, some of the old rules (namely, the cards) could mess up a carefully planned strategy, but they also helped in putting this game into the right perspective: a funny, unpredictable game of fantasy football that still rewards skill over luck and is playable in a couple of hours at most.

Very,very cool game...especially when paying a league with some friends. The variants are also very cool,with the DungeonBowl one being a favorite of mine. If you dont have the time to play a "big" game...just go with the 7´s version. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like the theme and the game mechanics work well. I just have a problem with the extreme luck factor in the game, especially because of the turnover mechnism where every dice roll could cost you the rest of the turn. The result might be better for the audience, but for the player it is not as satisfying to loose because of bad luck. In Blood Bowl you need luck to be able to execute your plans, while in other games your plans work as long as you dont have bad luck because it is more likely that you will screw up.

Classic sport combat game. Gotten alot of enjoyment out of this game over the years and still enjoy a quick pickup game.  League play is fun but can snowball for good or bad, and the compensation for uneven team match ups doesn't quite do it.

Marvellous game... Really, an excellent 2 player games which encompass all I would like to have into a game: statistics, speed of play and metagame. Still the theme can afraid some people and I must admit that I don't have enough time to dedicate anymore to this game. When I was a student, it was among my top 3 and I think I got a lot out of this game... Also online via FranceBloodbowl. I've surely played more than 200 games of it. I guess I'm too old for this one, now. It's the golden era of the Eurogames nawadays.

Very fun game where there is blood and gore on the field after a match. The game has a very high chance element as everything is decided with dice rolls. Each player has stats which can add or substract bonuses from the dice rolls. The strategy part of the game is good, but being unlucky with your rolls will make even the best strategy fail.

Great game with a wide range of stragies depending on the team you play.
What a pity, it´s only a 2 - person game. There are special season and tournament rules (improvement of your teams after a match and so on....), so more than 2 players can (in different matches) enjoy this great game.

The greatest competitive miniatures game GW has ever produced. Unlike their larger IPs, Blood Bowl has remained largely the same over the past 30 plus years, only being tweaked with the help of community feedback. Despite Warhammer having died and 40k being on the rocks, Blood Bowl still stands tall as a solid classic.

RATING: 8.1
It is in great shape for a game that has been extensively played.  I also have the Death Zone expansion.  The human plastic teams that came with it are 95% painted and I have five additional players plus the Ogre.  The Orc team is 60% painted.  

Reason for trading:  I have the computer version now.  People complain about the AI but I'm ok with it.  Since I have trouble finding opponents for the physical copy, the electronic copy is suitable.

Love the minis but did not enjoy such football-sporty game. The 'blood' added to the game did not entice me any further either. 

Played it and sold it off. Kept some of the teams for my WH game instead.

Best sports game ever! I'm always under the impression that I'm playing a real match when coaching my team, the end of a turn if you fail an action makes all decisions critic ones and generates a constant tension.
What a joy to pull out an improbable touchdown on turn 16 for the victory or hear the skull of an opponent's player under the pression of the boot of one of yours :)

Great, great game. 3rd edition rules were near-perfect for a miniatures based strategy game. Rating based on 3rd edition rules set.

Subsequent updates and changes through the Living Rulebook have dried up and neutered too much of the character of the game for my liking. So much so in fact that we've returned to a house-ruled version of 3rd edition, ironing out the few bits that needed adjusting to play the game we love.

To get a true experience of the game league play is essential.

RATING: 8
Not a great game, as such. Too long for the amount of luck. But it can be a very amusing league (using the expansion rules in Deathzone) as you get to control the team from game to game, dealing with the random events, finances, and watching players gain skills. Those that survive, anyway. Still, I had a ton of fun with this.

Rating is for a league. For an individual game, rating is 4-5.

Rating -- Indifferent for single games, could be talked into a league.

It took a couple plays for me to appreciate the game. It's a fun two-player, back and forth smack down that really shines in league play. Decisions between games about skilling up players and bringing new players on team are as crucial as any decision in the game. 

For beginners I suggest the Orcs or if you want to upgrade, buy the Lizardmen. They are both running teams that are tough, but not difficult to play. Beware of the Elves, they take some experience before you can use them effectively. 

I suggest checking this out if you have a group of 8 or more that get together frequently. At least half of the group needs a copy of the game.

My favorite game.  No other game captures the same tactical wargame feel that this does, yet makes it so very simple to play, entertaining, full of variety, and has a sports tie in which just really takes the cake.

As a veteran on several leagues and numerous teams I think that Bloodbowl is one of the games that has given me the most enjoyment. It is both tense and funny and it has a well balanced campaign system.

The third edition of the game was vastly improved. The turnover mechanic is brilliant. DeathZone supplement is essential for leagues. Living Rulebook made the game even better, but I haven't kept up with the updates.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The most intense game. You really need to keep your concentration. Every move you make is important. As soon as you fail a single roll your turn is over. This mechanic makes for really tense turns where the game may change in the blink of an eye. This definetly doesn't mean that the game is totally random, you just have to set your priorities straight and make some tough decisions. My all time favourite game. One off games are good but this game really excells in tournament/league play with friends where you really can get into grudge matches and such. One of the best parts is the diversity of the teams and that they have managed to make the teams really well balanced. You also don't require very many models to play.

Rate it a 4 if you play with those cursed cards.  Sold mine long ago.

Brilliant fun and a surprisingly good simulation of violent football at that! Random rolls are mitigated somewhat by a set of re-rolls and easy risk/reward calculations. Turn order is flexible with easy rolls at the start of the turn and often ending with a completely wild attempt.

The game also features campaign rules, meaning it becomes even more interesting and immersive to play a full tournament or a league. That requires a lot of time and a lot of players unfortunately.

FUN! I really like this game and it actually has quite a lot of strategy, but only if you play with all the rules. It can get quite long but it&#039;s sort of like Chess with Orks and Humans in my eyes. Even though luck can play a role, but not so much if you plan ahead.

I used to love playing "FootBrawl" for the Sega Genesis.  It was a football like game where there where booby-traps on the field and you could carry weapons to kill your opponents.

Well, I personally like this game. I like the gaming aspect since it's essentially a hardcore GW game like 40K on a football field.  I guess this is what scares most people away from it.  They shy away from a game where we have to refer to the rulebook too often.  But come on!  How can I 'know' the rules if I never get to play it?  Oh well, fun game nonetheless.

RATING: 8
Perhaps the best product ever produced by Games Workshop (though Necromunda is a close second), Blood Bowl is a fantasy-genre sports game that is a blast to play. The one-off games are fun, but the game really shines in the league management where you build up your team from game to game and season to season, hoping to quench a berth in the cup games!

The only downside is that the teams are not terribly well balanced, so not all teams are capable of consistently winning, and the designers of the game have stated that at least one (the Halflings) is not intended to be competitive with the rest of the teams at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The halcyon days of the mega-league I was part of will always be with me. This is a good game, but the XP for players (not you and me, the stars of the field!) and league system makes this game compelling. I wish I could find a similar league (and time to take part!) again!

Fantastic rules system.  The block dice are great.  The whole thing is a huge improvement over the previous editions.

This game is what it is.  Either it is your type of game or not.  Personally, I teeter to the not really my type of game, but in certain circumstances, I would definitely play it again.  It is a little long for the payoff.  The dice rolling can really throw a game to crap, a problem it tries to take care of.  This game reminds me of RoboRally, where there is usually one tremendous way of doing your turn.  The question is, can your mind wrap itself around the problem to solve it?  I tried my best, but this game takes training.  And at 3 hours a pop, I don't think I want to be trained.

Along with "Death Zone," this is the best edition of them all. No lie: I own nearly 23 complete teams, between 2 3rd edition, 1 2nd edition, and some self-conversions...and 14 of the teams are completely painted! I've been running leagues for years...the only reason I don't give it a full 10 is that there's no Plaguebearers of Nurgle in the 3rd edition rules - a gross oversight to be sure. Most of the Living Rulebook cheapens the game.

A fantasy miniatures war game, with a twist.  Instead of engaging your opponent in battle, you are playing a rugby/football-like game.  There is also the added twist that your players can develop over time, gaining skills that allow them to play better at Blood Bowl.  The 3rd edition made fouling an opponent a better option than the current rules edition.  Some players don't like fouling, but it's part of the rules and I have no problem with it.

Good for a quick game but like most GW games once they start stacking the rules and get too many "special Players" it just gets lame.  As in all GW games Chaos is the best.  Don't worry about scoring the first half just kill or knockout as much of your oppenents team and the second half is a breeze.  Try placing two boards on top of each other in the shape in the shape of crosshairs for a razzle dazzle four player gridiron battle.

This is in response to GW's request to have most of their player aids and rules references pulled from BGG. While I understand that it is within their rights to do so, I also believe that their is such a thing as being NICE. That is, as long as someone isn't hurting you, you should be good to them, even if it is with in your rights to be a grade A jerk. I find people that are jerks in these situations to be extremely, extremely annoying. So annoying, in fact, that the annoyingness transcends all rules, game types, and genres. Needless to say, Blood Bowl falls within this category and therefore gets a "2" rating, as it is 'extremely annoying". On the bright side, it is still not as bad as You Can't Check Me, not that I would ever buy either one or ever suggest to anyone one else ever to do the same.

One of the GW offshoot games that I never really cared for. It just never grabbed me...

For a short time we played this campaign style, and I used the unofficial Goblin/Squig team that was printed in one of GW's magazines. I basically just wanted an excuse to paint some squigs though.

The only real positive thing about this game, to me, is that it was/is relatively cheap vis a vis the other stuff that GW puts out.

Much prefer stuff like Necromunda to this though.

Football in the Warhammer universe. Note, I don't like sports games or Warhammer. This is still better than Warhammer IMHO. As a football game you can imagine it wasn't an accurate simulation. As for the Warhammer tie in I don't even know how well that was done. The game was somewhat fun to play.

Great rules, one of the best from GW. Developing field strats is a huge part of the game and there is nothing better than seeing them pay off, or watching your opponents crumble. The games can run a bit long, close to 3 hours sometimes but it flies by with the right opponents. You don't have to know diddly about football to get a kick out of this one.

The best tabletop Fantasy Football and one of my favorite games. A [u]positional[/u]/strategic game with tense and deep gameplay. Lots of different races, skills or special players, several tactics (both offensive and defensive) and player positions. Great components, theme and brutal player interaction, huge replayability. I play it using the Living Rule Book 6 (LRB6.0). A league play mode is, also, possible.
Miniatures painted. Warhammer Fantasy miniatures can be used to playing with new teams (or Star Players), in addition to the original Orc and Human teams.
A gem in my collection!

My only real issue is the amount of book keeping required for league play. That said, Blood Bowl is an exciting game of fantasy football. All teams have their own advantages and disadvantages, and when you play a league (difficult to keep together), you can watch your team grow over time -- or shrink, if your team members tend to get killed on the field a lot.

I think this is the greatest game on any platform that I have ever played.

Yes, there are cons:
- Can be EXTREMELY frustrating when luck does not go your way, and your favourite players die/lose a leg
- Rookie on rookie, or veteran vs veteran is fine. However, rookie vs unforgiving veteran is painful. Rookie will probably not enjoy the game. It is like chess in that way, despite luck being important
- Claw and chaos bash suck
- That's about it, unless you want to complain that your guy can't pick up the ball for 4 turns straight...

Pros:
- Sooooo much fun, soooo much replayability
- Build your own team, love your players, cry like a baby when they break a nail
- So many different teams, and the richest, most fun theme of any game I have ever played (and better than most books/movies

Recommended for anyone, but be patient, and remember it's all for fun.

Blood Bowl is just about the best thing that GW ever did.  The game mechanics are simple but have a near infinite scope for tinkering with and house-rules are common.  The league system is great fun, seeing one's team grow over several games and then get killed off an a particularly blood match just adds to the excitment.

This isn't to say that the game doesn't have problems.  There is a little too much luck for my liking and the handicap system (even with the 4th edition rules) doesn't really give the lesser teams much of a chance.  The flip-side is that the game is just so much fun that I'm prepared to put up with my mate rolling 4 6's in a row to pull of a massive touchdown pass, I know that I'll do something just as crazy soon enough.

Possibly GW's best boardgame, but I have never played Fury of Dracula yet. The Third Edition is greatly improved but still suffers from a few faults. Not at all the tedious military game that 1st- and 2nd- edition were, it is a real action game now. Still too much "sit there while my opponent analyzes his move", but a timer limits that somewhat. Like all games Workshop games, in order to really have variety you need to blow tons of cash on their miniatures and paint them to get a cool experience. Also best in campaigns with a decent-sized group of gamers to create a "critical mass". All of these mean commitment and it is so much easier to just open up another game and go...
 
The Living Rulebook rules added a lot of balance to the teams... much recommended!

I do like this game, particularly if you're playing in a league, but man can the luck of the dice be frustrating in this at times!

Two dice blitz on your pansy wood elf catcher [4 spaces from MY endzone], die elf scum!  2 attacker down results?  Seriously?  Fine, re-roll!  2 attacker down again?  FFS!  Okay, armour... beaten.  That's bad.  Injury... double 6?  Dead?  Goddamnit!!!

Nifty football game in the Warhammer world.  Miniatures look great and the game plays well.  About an hour to two hours for one game.  All the stats are on a one to six scale though, which leaves a little lacking in team variety.

1st Rating 5: Great game, good theme, spoiled for lack of balance: a better setup for one-off games would be necessary; hardly points to field an Elven team for example.
Far too slow for the type.
Expansion lurking features as you'd expect, but still feels 'complete' if you play the included teams only.

Revised to 6,5: I've found new upgrade rules that no longer allow free mix of team players, this completely trashed the game before. Also the too strong Stars may have been tuned down?

One of the finest meshes of deep strategy and hilarious atmosphere ever cast into cardboard.  The diverse teams, limitless campaign seasons, and darkly-comical football theme have made Blood Bowl a timeless classic.

I hate it when an entire game depends on if I roll a one or not.  And that happens way too often.  I got about 5 people to try to do a tournament thing.  My brother made a team of slow, but dangerous Chaos Warriors and although he'd never win, he killed half your team so that you'd lose your next game.  Anyway, it was fun for a while, but people got burned out on the whole project.  Still, it's easier to get a game of blood bowl going some days that you'd think.  I take this off the shelf probably once a year.

Mindig is nagyon vágytam a games workshop féle figurás játékokra. A hely/pénzügyi parapméterek alapján erre tudtam szert tenni, jó 1996 tájékán. Iszonyat jó a hangulata, és jó kis meccseket lehet vele lejátszani. Külön izgalmas a cscapat menedzselése esetleg több meccsen átívelően. Ritkán játszunk vele, és akkor mindig fel kell eleveníteni a nem kevés szabályt. Sajnos évek óta nem vettük elő, node ami késik nem múlik. Ajánlom mindenkinek, aki szeret festegetni, és szeretne vicces 1-2 órás kétszemélyes játékot, amiben van szerencse faktor és taktika egyaránt.

you players develop and you can give them skill that match your playing strategy. Is this a tactical strategy game.

RATING: 8
The best football game, hands down.  Starter box is a huge bargain and comes with everything to play, including two teams of minis.  Even if all you did is play with what comes in the starter box, you will love it.  It uses dice, but this is no mere dicefest.  What you do, and the order you do it in, are crucial.  If this game does not get you hooting and hollering, you are deficient in the fun gene.

RATING: 9
A very good game I think. A lot more tactical than you would first suppose by watching the truckloads of dice thrown around. But calculated risk taking is key, and placement is extremely important, and in the end many things can make the difference in a game beyond dumb luck. In my experience good players tend too win pretty often versus less good ones so that's a good sign. I love the different races and how the style of play varies tremendously between them. You always find yourself looking for new and fun strategies to try out with teams you haven't yet played. Played it to death with my group a few years ago and in the end it became too much. But now, after a little respite, I'm dying to create a new team and set up a league.

A great miniatures football battle game. You can really get into this game, with all of the additional rules, that can be added as you pick up on the game. It looks great and game play is a ton of fun. All kinds of things can happen in this game and they will. Players will be injured, killed, ejected, thrown, knocked down and crushed, cheat and much much more.

The game is a bit on the heavy side and is definitely a gamers game, but it's well worth learning, as it's just so much fun.

I've been a fan of Blood Bowl since the PC game came out back in '95.  Every version of the board game has improved over the previous versions.

I have a mixed feelings of Blood Bowl, on the otherhand there is tons of luck and it's the kind of luck which makes people red in anger, it's way too long at least while playing live and you have to play it a lot to get most out of it (players gaining experience, league play etc.). But there is still a lot of feeling, humor, skill and it's one of those classics which makes you go back to it again and again... I just wish it would be third of the lenght playing live.

Great as a league game and tactically very deep. Way too slow compared to modern games though. A two-player game like this should be 1.5h out of and back in to the box, not 3h. You also need to play a lot of games in a league to get your team going before the game really becomes the best it can be.

In later stages of a league it becomes quite hard to keep track of the skills of your opposing players as well as your own. PC version does all this automatically and games only last 1/3 of the time. Unless you really are into the miniatures, the digital version is all you need.

Good combination of fantasy and football.  Rules are failry simple, but the game requires lots of strategy to win (luck helps too).  When compared to the 2nd ed, "Turnover" rules create more risk and keeps the game flowing.  Obviously, one of my all time favorites.  If I have one complaint, the cost of the minis (and time needed to paint them all) limits the team(s) that you can play and thus, limits variety.

what were they thinking?  Special dice?  I loved many of the earlier version of GW games.  It seems in their quest to make them more accessible to the average kid, they just took a lot of the flavor out for me.  The more a game relied on special dice the less fun I had with it.

A fun game, but expensive, overly complex for its level of game meatiness, and time consuming.  This game is really only worth playing if you have a group big enough for a league because watching your team grow is the best part of the game.  Even then there are serious serious balance issues, which can really make playing the game less fun.  While there are some mechanisms to help out the crap teams in the league, often after the first 2-3 games of a league, you can tell who is going to win the whole thing.  The rules both try to simulate too much and abstract too much.  I would rank this a 4.5 but it is a lot of fun, I would probably play in a league if there was one near me, and attempting to have a sufficiently detailed football-like game is very difficult.  The fantasy theme also adds to the fun factor and attracts non-football fans.

I own a core set, but without a group of dedicated players that want to play through a campaign, it doesn't really make sense to build a team. I played the game online for a while, with the somewhat horrible Cyanide client. No clue whether the second iteration of the video game is any better than the first.

Blood Bowl is one of my all time favorites and I've been playing it alot with different people. It sure lacks the speed you might expect from a fantasy football game, but instead you get tons of fun. I rate it 8, because of the high price, unavailability (extra teams, expansions, miniatures) and the flimsy component and box quality of the fourth edition. Sure you get a bagful of Citadel miniatures, but most of the thin cardboard boxes were already bruised when they were piled on the store's shelves. Not to mention what happens if you travel with it alot...

Regularly played in a league, with modified rules and 30+ teams to choose from.  The best part of the game is improving your team over time.  I don't enjoy one-off games nearly as much.  Since dice are used to determine if anything succeeds, there is some luck involved.  Skillful play helps to mitigate the luck as much as possible, but still sometimes it seems you are just destined to win or lose the game no matter what.

Fun and easy light fantasy football game from Games Workshop.  GW was at its best here, making a game where each side has a small number of models who progress and change as games are played.  You really have to play this in a league to get the full effect.  After a few games, you get quite attached to your favorite players.  I really ought to dust off my Dark Elves...it's been far too long since I last ganged up on an opponent's best player and mercilessly fouled him...

I admit to having a soft spot for Blood Bowl, having had good fun with the 1st edition when it came out in the 80's, so my opinions may be biased by nostalgia. That said, I've never played the 3rd edition until now (June 2009) and one significant rule change has made this a much better game: when a player muffs, the entire team's turn is over. This adds a lot of tactical considerations that didn't exist in the 1st edition, where every player got to move regardless of the outcome. Now you have to think a lot more about the order in which your players execute their actions, as any action may be the team's last. 

Blood Bowl is my favorite sports simulation, even though it does not simulate an actual sport. The game definitely has it's drawbacks and bad design decisions and unbalanced elements, but the system is versatile enough that many of the unnecessary extras can be ignored. Every team is statistically and visually unique and when I think of theme and character taking a game beyond where its mere mechanics place it, this is THE game I think of. I have so many memorable moments from playing this game, and really, how many mere games can offer triumphs and defeats that can be regaled decades later? It makes me feel like a kid, while still presenting a significant tactical challenge.

This game is one of my absolute FAVORITES--it's #1 on my list!--& it satisfies my love for violent fantasy/sci-fi sports themed board games.  Since I can't play GRAV-BALL anymore (get that game license GW or FF & update it--please!!), B.B.(3rd ed.) fits the bill very nicely.  It's a blast creating your teams, painting the models & taking to the pitch to bash each others' brains out with whatever move--legal or illegal--or weapon (illegal, of course) in order to score a touchdown.  The best designed parody of sports--EVER!  I love every chance I get to play this game & it will be in my top 10 games FOREVER!

Ranks right behind Space Hulk as games workshop's best stuff. Love all the different teams and the many playing styles you can choose from. Like Space Hulk  there is a lot of strategy in this but also a lot of dice rolling. Also like Space Hulk it can get very tense. This was a real improvement over the 2nd edition, the turnover rule was a brilliant addition that really opened up the strategy portion of the game. You really have to weigh the risk of your move cause if you fail, it's the other guys turn. Plus the minis with this one were great.

A very fun game of fantasy football! A bit on the rules-heavy side, and takes a few hours, if not an entire evening, to play...

Also there´s a lot of official and fanbased support for the game.

Dwarves rule! I owned a dwarf team for some twenty years and those guys were ever the only miniatures I got over to actually paint and properly play with. A very intense game with a great theme.

I want to love this game.  I first learned of it in the early 1990's when a friend was getting into it.  I only found it last year and bought it with dreams of making my own stadium, painting my miniatures, and expanding with many teams.  Then I saw how much and how rare the expansion teams were and realized that I don't have the time or talent to dedicate to making a stadium and painting all these teams.  So the game has sat on my shelf untouched for a year.  It's really too bad because I really the combination of miniatures and football.

I always want to enjoy GW games for the sake of the fantastic miniatures, but their flagship games have two fatal flaws: you need to paint too many miniatures, and the games aren't actually much fun to play.  This game, along with Necromunda and Space Hulk, is the exception.  The problem with it is just that it is only fun as a campaign game, and as a campaign game, there is a luck element in player development (and survival) that can derail a campaign.

Blood Bowl was one of my favorite games for a long time and I like it to this day, though I probably will rarely play it in the future. My major problem with this game has always been, that I was winning too much, so people usually didn't want to play me. It is probably the only game where I have trouble going easy on my opponent and where I actually care about winning. I don't think I have ever lost a game of Blood Bowl.
I really like the theme of the game and the miniatures are also great. Though I'm usually not too fond of strategy games, I really enjoyed this one. Also painting the miniatures was much more manageable than in Warhammer  Fantasy, because for each team there were only 12 to 16 players. So my teams are actually all fully painted, which makes the game even more appealing.

A very random and chaotic game, but a dynamic reroll and turnover system make it a fun game to play. Always a lot of excitement over the course of one game, and lots of fun for building a team over a season. The league here is currently going through season 9.

RATING: 7
The slow gameplay and my lack of interest in American Football is what makes me not to play this as much as I'll like to. I DO like to roll dice, but sometimes it gets somehow tedious and repetitive and the randomness of the game is cute for the first few games but after that is annoying to have your star player killed because you rolled a certain number. Adding to that, the game is not exactly strategic, the game plan is most of the times deterred by the randomness of the dice, ending in a series of meaningless decisions again and again. The 7 is because the miniatures, and the world around it are awesome and flavorful.

I used to play the 1st edition quite a lot (which is like Warhammer on a football field!) and the 2nd edtion was very good, but the 3rd edtion (and 4th & 5th which use the same mechanic) is streaks ahead. Still play online (FUMBBL and/or the Cyanide PC game) and still play the board version when I can find an opponent!

This rating is actually for Blood Bowl played in a league. It's my favorite game when played in a league.  Outside of a league or tournament, it's maybe a 6.  Third Edition was fun to play, but I play by the latest set of the Living Rulebook these days.  The LRB 5.0 is swinging back toward 3rd ed. rules actually.

Blood Bowl est une simulation de matches de football américain. La différence notoire provient de la nature des joueurs. Dans Blood Bowl vous coachez une équipe de guerriers, violents et sans états d'âme.

Blood bowl est désormais un classique des jeux de stratégie. À la frontière du Wargame, le jeu nécessite de la tactique, un certain sens du jeu et pas mal de "courage" !

This is a great game, full of tense, important decisions, all of which can be undone in a single die roll.  This would get a higher rating from me if it weren't quite so long to play.  It usually takes us 3-4 hours to play a single game, which is often a bit too much for our group.

3rd edition rules are a big - no tremendous - improvement over earlier editions.  The game moves much more swiftly and the turnover rule is simply genious.

RATING: 7
Best described as a "press-your-luck" game. You have to make every d6 roll; as soon as you fail, your turn ends. 

Although that sounds hideous, there are tactics that mean experienced players will (nearly) always beat newbies. 

Asymmetric teams and a legacy-style league add a ton of re-playability.

One of my all time favorites. We played many leagues in the 90s and always had a great time. Revisiting it now I only take a point away for the length of play; we just can't find enough time to play multiple 3 hours games.

Move your players and roll dice to score most touchdowns.

3rd edition was later perfected by the Living Rulebook edition, see that entry. I rate LRB a 10 and this a 6 because I would never play 3rd edition rules again. This was where it started coming together.

Plays: More than 100.
Type: Thematic sports game = A theme-driven game that simulates a sport.
Complexity: Heavy sports game.
# of players: 2.
Playing time: 90 mins.
Player interaction: Conflict.
Randomness: Medium – Dice, but you can choose the desired risk v. reward ratio and the order of rolls.

Replayability: Extremely high, this has depth to explore and a campaign system that lets your team grow and improve. You’re always itching to use the new skills your players have aquired.
Fun: This incarnation of Blood Bowl was where GW started getting it right. Massively unbalanced but lots of fun. The theme is implemented with a great deal of tongue-in-cheek humour, and it’s still a great strategy game “under the hood”. Looks great, plays great.
Memorability: No game I have ever played creates stories like Blood Bowl. You’re always feeling with your players, both when they succeed when they really should fail and when they fail when they really should succeed. You’ll always remember the time that your star Troll blocked a halfling for three skulls – AV break – RIP – regeneration fail, killing the Troll, as well as the time when your Mummy threw a long bomb to a Skeleton for the winning TD in the last turn.

Thematic integration: Extremely high.
Components: Fantastic. GW games always have great looking bits, and this is no exception.

Who will like this: Gamers that like the theme.

The introduction of the turn-over rule in this edition might be the single most brilliant piece of game design ever. It transformed a static combat game into the dynamic sports game that it is today.

The game is good. But on the one hand almost everything in the box is obsolete the moment you buy it: rules, sheets, cards, etc. You pay 100 euros and get pratically nothing in return. In the other hand, the online information is excellent. You can't have it all, i guess. Perfect league game.

"I only need one more 3+ and I've scored!..."

One of Games Workshop's finest productions, many a summer was spent pounding my mate's team into the turf with this game. One of the most played games of my teens! Sometimes I even remember to try and score!

Yeah, so it's more often then not a luck-driven dicefest from start to finish, so what?

Turnovers add a constant sweat to your turn and makes risk management the highest priority. Shines even brighter when you play league play (Deathzone expansion), allowing you to develop teams and manage player skills and stats. 

Teams are purposely unbalanced to offer various skill level teams, but over the years I still saw most of them highly successful at one time or another despite popular belief (my best friend had a nasty Halfling team)! Skaven are my babies though!

Those that love it are the ones that laugh when their star player face plants into the pitch, dies and costs him the game when he tries to Go For It and score. That's BB for you! I try to be a good loser, but sometimes even I'm worn down by my 10+ losses in a row due to awful dice rolling.

Offended by the "protest" ratings. Stop hitting the game and bitch to GW people!

Currently using the "Competiton Rules" set (essentially LRB 6.0) and have spent the last 2 years playing it on www.FUMBBL.com (FREE Blood Bowl online)!

However, in recent times I have become tired of FUMBBL's over competative attitude (I just want to have fun!) and with one of my friends calling it quits I've all but given up on it for now. Maybe again sometime in the future...

This is a game to be played in a league where the characters can evolve, gain skills and even die (that occurs frequently) :-) . The turnover rule (your turn ends right after an unsuccesful move) adds tension and though decisions to make. Those who hate dice throwing games may not like Blood Bowl, but I think that the unpredictability of some moves can add more fun to the game.

Blood Bowl is a truly fantastic game.  Even if I were not a football fan, the myriads of strategies and important tactical decision making would make this game shine.  Add to that a great deal of customization and a cool push your luck element, and it's clear why Blood Bowl is so loved.  The fantasy theme and the (american) football similarities are just icing on a very delicious cake.

What separates Blood Bowl from other great games, however, is its season rules.  I have never seen better extended play rules, and the new strategies and options introduced by playing in a league are awesome.  You really feel like you are managing a real team, and seeing your players improve is really fun.  I cannot recommend playing in a Blood Bowl league enough.  It is one of the finest gaming experiences.

RATING: 7
Not that much fun in a one off game, but when you're in a league the fun this game presents is hard to beat.  The system works nicely giving players the choice to try to beat up the other team or just try to outscore them with finesse.  It can be hard to find enough motivated players for this to get a good league going, and w/o a league the game is someone lacking.

RATING: 10
One of only three games in my collection that deserves the perfect '10'!

A paraody of Amercian Football in a fantasy setting, with teams of elves, dwarves, orcs, and so on. All teams have their strenghts and weaknesses.
The turnover rule makes every move important, so you really have to think things through, but the 4 minute time limit never lets you do that.
It's kinda like Chess with some randomness thrown in. There's always that little chance of failure, but if you play well you can stack the odds in your favour.
If you play poorly, then you'll have to rely on being lucky.

RATING: 8
I have played well over 100 games.  Unlike the prior versions, the 3d edition accurately captures what it was supposed to re-create: mayhem, chaos, humour, violence and fast-paced action.  Skill is the biggest factor in determining the outcome, but luck plays a significant part.  This can be frustrating, but also is very exciting.

You can develop your team, acquiring new players and watching your old ones getting killed or gaining experience and new skills.  You get a large number of different teams to choose from.  The miniatures are expensive, but fortunately, you do not need many for a team. This also means you aren't going to have to spend three years assembing and painting a team either.  The game takes about 2 hours to play, but can be longer if it goes into over-time.  The rules have been updated and several balance issues have been addressed with the newest official living rules.

The game is also available in PC and I find the implementation very good.  Easy to find oppoents or a league.

This was the game that was first "heavily played" in my gaming career. Bought this in 1994 (1995?) and it was played on weekly basis for 5-6 years. One of the simpler games that have straight-forward rules, are fast to play (if you know what you are doing) and are really fun to play!

Usually I don't like sports games, but this is an exception. This definitely needs DeathZone expansion, but is very playable without it.

I've been playing this on and off for over twenty years! PC version is fun, but not as fun as playing with minis. A league of a few players is essential. Playing the PC dimmed my ardour for this a fair amount... I think I had to play it too much in too short a time period. Still without doubt the best thing GW ever did.

Although more miniature that board game this is a classic. Simple rules on a timer with endless possible team mixes makes fantasy football with deathrollers and pogo sticks great fun. It suffers from the rich get richer in progressive team play but as an out of the box game that you can learn fast and take years to master still one of the best games GW ever made.

Incredible opportunity for complete customization of teams. Lots of strategy here, a little luck and tons of fun.  

It has everything I like in a game. Strategy, fast play, minis, customization and something new-the ability to take a team through a league setting that lasts longer than one play session.

If this was more accessible and more available in my gaming circle-it would get a hell of a lot more plays. But it doesnt. This is only thing keeping this from a 8/9 rating.

Great game in league play although a bit stressful as you have a lot of games to play if luck doesn't go your way early in the season. It can be hear breaking if a stat skill up player is injured or killed (str+ wight).
Ultimately a lot of strategy and risk mitigation that can be ruined by a bad run with the dice.

It can play a little on the long side (if you think too much).

One off games are fun but a bit pointless...

Very fun game to play online at FUMBBL, because the games only last 30-60 minutes. I'd rate this a 10, but playing on a board is quite slow and I don't really enjoy the figurines and manual dice rolling, so I'll settle the rating at 9.

The game is fun even when you concentrate none of your power to score - but everything in causing a bloody mayhem on the field!

The game is probably the best miniature game produced by GW. It has sensible balance between tactics and luck and a team consists of ~10 figures. 

I'm glad that the Living Rulebook is updated once in a while, since once again, I don't understand GW's decision to stop printing a game with a lot of demand. Well, perhaps they do have a good reason...

The game really shines when the league is played, it gives the continuity and progress the coaching needs.
The game is awesome. Cruel but awesome!

There is simply no other game even kind of like this one.  Battle football.  I love the concept of a troll throwing a goblin over the line who's holding the football, and oops...the troll got hungry and ate the goblin!  The races each have great tactics unique to them.  Some are good at playing the ball (agile, quick, can do things like jump over players) and some are there just to kill everyone and walk the ball to the endzone on an empty field.  It's also like an RPG in that your players advance in campaigns as they score points in each game.  The game thinks of everything such as scatter plates for dropped balls, duggouts for hurt players, and rules rules rules to do just about anything you can think of.  As a bonus, you can paint the minis and customize your teams.  A landmark game for me.

If you are either a fan of sports OR a fan of medieval-style fantasy, you really should check this out. If you're a fan of both, you CANNOT pass this up. At its heart a very fun game, Blood Bowl is a perfect 10. It has a very clever system which leaves little room for ambiguity, works excellently and does not drag. It creates an incredible feeling of immersion, not the least because of the top-notch quality of its material and its miniatures. And, most importantly -- it allows for a growing hobby, extending the game to any number of aficionados and enabling one's playing skills to grow AS WELL as one's fictional team skills. Goes way beyond a mere game -- it can carve a hobby all its own in your leisure time.

An absolute classic among a certain generation of gamers, and still getting updates and new editions. It's still fun albeit very random and unbalanced.

It's not as streamlined as modern games and there is downtime because players take turns moving their teams.

There is some strategy/tactics, but really 95% of it boils down to:
- Placing your models in the obviously sensible positions to maximise the modifiers from their 'zones of influence'. You can achieve a domino effect by doing this right each time.
- Being sensible about its strong push-your-luck element because your turn ends when you fail something. So, for example, if it's your turn and you want to resolve a football throw that might give you a touchdown you're probably daft if you first try to resolve a few random fights.

The main point of this game is that, if you play with all the rules (search online for its Living Rule book, for example, or find the latest edition on the Games Workshop web site), you can do almost anything. Lay traps, hire cheerleaders, reincarnate players, bribe referees etc.

Notably, it also has a lot of campaign elements. So you can have a lot of fun building your team over many matches. And it's all nicely ad hoc, not serious.

It's an ageing mess, but a glorious one. I'm not aware of anything else quite like it and it really screams 'classic 1980s Games Workshop'.

I've played Blood Bowl since its 2nd edition and have always enjoyed it, a lot, especially after the LRB -release. The gameplay is fast and furious, just like the theme - violent football on a pitch. However there's enough depthness in the game mechanics. E.g. you can play different teams, each having different strenghts and weaknesses. Then again you can have different strategies for each opponent. In addition there's random factors in gameplay, which increase the fun factor and makes you to want 'that second shot'. You should try several teams before you can really master BB.

For one-shot games I'd rate BB a 9, but its the league game, where Blood Bowl really shines. You start with a rookie team, which starts to develop game after game. You get experience for players, collect winnings, buy new players and finally receive new skills for the most experienced players. Its the continuity that really hooks you up to the game. Team members develop into star players and individuals, but there's always a danger of injuries and deaths, which keeps your on alert. Blood Bowl is the only game, in which I can get totally angry at one moment and at the second moment be cheerful. Blood Bowl doesn't leave you cold, that's for sure!

(to Australia) Trade interest: moderate. The only sport I'm interested in. You have to play it in a league with the drafting rules to get the most out of it. The plastic minis that come with it are crap, so you really need to find some metal ones for your team. Also, be sure to use the latest Living Rulebook to get the most balanced play.

Add one or two points to the rating for regular league play with painted minis.

The game is unbalanced, so I suggest giving the weakest teams (e.g. halflings) to the strongest players. You could use a shared pool of minis and hand out teams based on ladder results, or make people bid gold or league VPs for the stronger teams.

One of the only real good games by Games Workshop, finally avalaible again. You get two teams with the basic game (humans and orcs), so in the beginning you don't have to buy more than that. Very fun and lots to laugh, especially if you crushed another one of these Human Linemen again... ;) Even in the basic version a very good game, although your possibilities are rather limited, depending on which team you play. Apparently the most fun when playing in a league, although I never had time for it.

I had previously rated this a 7.5, but in protest of GW's recent cease and desist letter to BGG, I am un-rating the game.  I was in the midst of painting my minis, and have suddenly lost all appetite to play the game, or any other official GW game.  Off to play their also-banned, fan-maintained, NetEpic.  If GW doesn't want to support their fans, I see no reason for BGG users to give them free advertising and product support.

Silly die rolling fun. Players take a team of blood thirsty football players and try to score touchdowns. The fun part is the building of teams with different abilities and using them to the best of their effect.

There is a fair amount of rules and tables consulting for newbies (and there are so many editions of living rules it's not funny) and an experienced player and/or unbalanced teams will make for a sore experience.

Still, all round good tension and fun. Pity that GW in Australia has REMOVED BloodBowl from their product line in favour of Warhammer and LOTR. Meh.

Digital Edition at FUMBBL/Steam nowadays. Have run an online league for this for about a year now, and it's a great experience. People complain about the dice, but it's really a game about risk management.

The big thing with this game is that it's campaign length. This means not only do things even out long term as far as luck, but you also build an attachment to your teams. It matters when a favored player dies, or when you know you've removed a dangerous player from your league, one whose left a trail of bodies in his career's wake. Or maybe some rookie player trips and dies on his first game.

Cool theme, a humorous take on the Warhammer universe. 

Plenty of variety in terms of teams (at additional cost) with asymmetrical playing styles and strengths. Rules for tournaments and team growth also an option, with leagues around the world. 

Rules are good, not completely water tight, and some mistakes can be brutally punished (turnovers!) but there are plenty of strategies and options to keep things fresh.

Like with other old GW concepts, I approached this game with a certain stuck-up attitude. This time (and the same happened with Space Hulk), I was up for a major surprise.

This system has been honed through the years and, regardless of all the dated roll a d6 and see what happens spin, really shines in conveying its theme, and the sense of a streamlined football engagement (I'm no football fun, clearly), leaving plenty of interesting and relevant strategic and tactical decisions. To me, playing this solo is not too far from watching a sporting event unfold (slightly sick, I know). 

I can see why interest in this held up through the years the way it has. Leagues must be amazing.

High replayability, high luck factor. I always liked to play (and did so regularly, participating in local league seasons before moving), but then you need someone who really digs the theme and is interested in games with 30+ pages of rules. So I gave my game and all the minis to my brother (who isn't playing this either).

[u]Key Words:[/u] Fantasy Football/Rugby - Miniatures - League Play - 2-Player - 2h

[u]Summarized Opinion:[/u] Great tactical fantasy football game, especially good in a league/tournament format.

[u]My Rating Explained:[/u] Excellent. Still good after hours of play.

[u]Verbose Assessment:[/u]

This is a great game, and I'm not even a sports fan. Pick and assemble your team and off to the pitch!

It shines especially in the context of a league or tournament as there are rules for injury, prize money, number of fans you have etcetera that will see your team evolve depending on how well it is doing. Winning well will make it easier to hire new and better players, but even a losing team will evolve over a few games.

The game involves lots of dice rolls, and yet it is not heavily luck-dependant as the way you play will determine how much luck you need to win. Play well, and your odds will improve considerably. I love those kind of games, as they have all the variety and surprises of dice-driven games, yet offer the tactical challenge of luckless games.

It's a miniatures game, but not extremely expensive as a full team is only about 15 miniatures. Teams can still be found on eBay. If you're into that, it's fun to paint your team according to your own design.

The game can run quite long if you're the considering type, so if that's an issue you might want to use a timer. The official rules even assume one is used.

Strongly recommended. Do use the excellent ruleset offered in the Living Rulebook, available as a free download.

I have a strong affection with this game, which in the years 1995-2000 became a part of my life. In those years me and my brother (who is the actual owner of the game) with two other friends played five tournaments which lasted for months. Each tournament scheduled 27 matches, one every monday night, and we spent the rest of the week commenting the match and the most memorable plays, making fun of each other, just like real football fans. 
By the way, I have never been a real football or soccer fan, but I definitely am a Blood Bowl fan... Reikland Reavers rule!

In all this insanity we kept records of all stats for every single player (including yards rushed) and at the end of every season played All Star games and compiled a yearbook with all the stats, results and the articles we had written about the outstanding facts.
Still these days, 12 years after the last tournament, every now and then me and my brother fancy about organizing a new one, but we realistically no longer have the spare time for such commitment. Should we never play Blood Bowl again, at least one thing from the game will remain for sure: my nickname (Stug Sturmpanzer) derives from my Reavers star player blitzer (16 TDs and 8 MVPs in 22 games, killed by the crowd in the last match of the last regular season...).

Regarding the rules, this edition represents a decisive improvement over the previous one, allowing an optimal balance between fun, challenge and playing time. Mechanics are more streamlined and the game flows much better. Thumbs up to the two halves/sixteen turn system, re-rolls, irregular procedure (great fun to call!) and turnovers. This rule forces the player to think carefully about his actions, because a single mistake will hand the move to the opponent, so riskiest actions must be kept for the end of the turn, if you can. Sadistically, we halved turn time (four minutes in the rules, two minutes in our games), so time was always running out and this made the game very thrilling and challenging.

RATING: 8
Very solid base game of Fantasy American Football. Even though I don't give a **** about the 'real' version, pummeling your way through a bunch of Elves/Dwarves/Zombies to score a touchdown is just FUN! Rulebook is terrible, so get someone to teach it to you, it's actually quite simple to learn (but hard to execute well...).

BEST THING: it supports LEAGUE PLAY. But for that: SEE LIVING RULEBOOK entry!

- Strategy and fun, at its best. There is a lot of mechanics involved in this seemingly simple game and that makes it a lot of fun but you need to know what you are doing and play agains someone that have some comprehension about the rules. 
- A lot of work, yes you can play the game basically straight out of the box but this takes away quite a lot from the the atmosphere around the game. You will at some stage need to paint the figures comming with the game and you will also need to buy new players to enhance your team and at some stage you will feel the need to buy a completely new team or teams to get a different type of gaming experience. Which will lead us into the next bullet, cost.
- Expensive and time consuming, you will have to buy paint, and new figures at some point. And it will take you some time to get everything painted and set-up to make the perfect teams. But thats also the charm of this game, you will make it your own and you will definitely feel for your players as they get hurt or in worst case your team has a fatality.

For all the dice rolls going on in this game, it really is a lot of fun.

I played a BB enthusiast (it was my first game) and though I only won 1-0, it was the most one-sided game ever. Essentially, I brought American Football knowledge and tactics to the game, tweaked it to take in to account the difference in rules and proceeded to play him off the pitch.

We're now looking to set up a league which I'm eagerly anticipating.

So I recently dropped this from an 8 to a 6... there are simply too many games of this that have come down to good die rolls.  It can be aggravating at times to do everything right and lose miserably.  I don't mind die rolls in games, and in fact generally prefer it, but this game relies far too heavily on them for the outcome.  Still, I love the variety this game brings, and if you can find a good group and can hold a full tournament, I recommend you give it a go.

Updated rules have made me shift this from a 6 to a 6.75.  Still a great game, but... 

When the GW folks tell me that a guy a 6 movment and 7 armor is exactly balanced with a guy who has 5 movement and 8 armor... that's a problem.  ARMOR IS VASTLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN MOVEMENT when playing in a league/season situation.  Especially when said units cost the exact same amount.

This places teams with higher average armor values at the top of the charts season after season, and they're pretty much ok with it.

Paired with the fact that they allow some teams to be jokes/substandard... and that they killed the only team I ever wanted to play... *shrug*

I want to rate it higher, but I can't.

This game looked like it might be one of my favourite games of all time.

Played two seasons. First season, gave this game an "8". Part of that might have been that I won the cup-- but mostly it's just a great game, both complex and simple, requiring strategy, risk management, and good sportsmanship.

Second season, though, was just dreadful-- my team rating was 50+ below that of other teams. And when there's that big of a disparity between team ratings, the game just falls apart, frankly. 3+ handicaps proved pretty useless.  The skills possessed by 200+ rating teams makes it hard, if not impossible, to do much of anything-- and if you can't score star player points, you can't begin to rectify the situation with skills of your own, resulting in a loop of games getting harder and harder.  My last game ended with only two of my team members left on the field.

I understand that the Living Rulebook has introduced a new system to make things more equitable, but as far as 3rd edition goes-- it's great when teams are roughly equal, and falls apart when they're not.

After all these years, this game is still a good laugh and it offers some real strategy despite its randomness. The Citadel sculpts are great, and the various teams that are available for it ensure its replayability. A complete game takes quite some time to play though - probably around 3 hours. The only thing that I dislike about the game is that the game's rules are still subject to change. And the later rulesets (living rulebook v6!) seem more generic & balanced than the previous ones - which were more thematic & fun. I still want to be able to supplement my human team with Ogres, Elves & Dwarves!

rating is for campaign play, and if you've got a group of 8 people to run a season with (using the deathzone advancement rules and such, or just the living rulebook), I highly recommend it.

One of the many Games Workshop releases that has proven its worth on the tabletop. If you like the hobby aspect of collecting and painting miniatures, but don't want to invest a mountain of money doing so, this is a great game to start with. Typically your team  will consist of about 11 players (a few more for reserves if you so choose) and the range of teams allow you to have more if you like. The playability of the game is quite enjoyable as well. Especially for those with vivid imaginations...envisioning the actual sight of a halfling holding tight to the pigskin whilst being thrown down field by a treeman, tumbling upon impact, standing up and waddling in for a touchdown. Fun stuff to be sure!

Lots of time invested in this one. Great game. Like leveling up, like the strategy, like the tension and as a former GW nerd i like the theme. Best in league play though.

The box has puncture in the top.  The components are in excellent condition.  The counters are unpunched.  The figurines are mostly black.  A couple have been partially painted.  I would like to trade this with the Death Zone expansion.

RATING: 7
Rating based only on one play of the base game.  Game shows its age, but as far as sports sims go, this is one of the tighter and more interesting ones.  There's a lot of surprising positional value here.  You'll need the dice to go your way, but there's also a lot of strategy to make sure your plays go according to plan.   As far as football sims that feature player movement, this is one of the better ones, though of course you have to allow for the zany fantasy theme mixed into your football.

Nothing like a game of Blood Bowl for a bit of mindless violence and a victory lap round the table after a touchown.

I have played this couple of times as a teenager, now two plays as and adult. In these later plays we have used the Living Rulebook 5+ expansion. At least it gives more variation, but I don't remember the old rules well enough to say are these new any better. Most likely yes, because they are very similar, so there is no drastic change.

Two player game, which takes quite a lot of time and some table space, but not as much as for example WHFB or WH40K. Miniature requirements are also lesser and there's no irritating(?) measuring on the field.

Updated after five more plays, now "serious" league games. Especially with LBR5+ the game is even better. Updating the rating from 7 to 8.

Started the fourth season, still very good. Now using the LRB6.

25 plays, 4 seasons, still a great game. Next season I'm starting with a new team.

Ended the 5th and 6th season with Orcs, no change.

Along with Warhammer Quest and Space Hulk, Blood Bowl was one of the better Games Workshop board games.  This one crept into GW's monetization schemes though, becoming really expensive if you wanted the complete experience.  Too bad FFG didn't get to do a full reprint, the BB card game didn't come close.  I still hold onto my copy out of nostalgia.

I broke down and picked thus up from GW. I spent 3 hours painting the teams that came with it. I primed them with skull white, used blue where needed on the humans, red on the orcs and green on the bases. At least now you can tell the teams apart and with the green bases they look much color on the field. I'll play a game this week and continue painting them when time permits. *UPDATE*I played a quick (one quarter) game. I love it!

One of my favourite games through times, I started playing it in the mid 90s. There is one problem with it and it's time. 

I don't currently play it, as the setup and transport needed to play in leauges removes the fun and would destroy a lot of the week.

I sold this a few years ago and was always sorry I did.  I bought it again and am in the process (very slowly) of painting the minis.  This is a GREAT game- it really is one of GW's best, right up there with Space Hulk.

A very good fantasy football game with strategy and luck mixed together very well.  Need to play with a 4 minute time limit per side.  Finally, this really shines in league play where the coaches trade verbal jabs back and forth.

RATING: 6
My first game ever (and the game that started me in this hobby) and after more then 20 years still an oldtimes favorite but as with so many games sooner or later a better version comes along that makes the previous game look absolete. Recently I learned about Dreadball and had to chance to try that out and everything about Dreadball is better then Blood Bowl (game itself, League rules, teams, rules, time spend playing, general feeling of the game) so I think I will sell Blood Bowl and will continue with Dreadball and Deadball Xtreme!

RATING: 10
I love this game!  It's a fast-paced, funny and fun parody of American football.  And I don't even like football.  (However, I've noticed that since playing Blood Bowl, I actually understand football better, and (dare I say it) even now find it INTERESTING to watch.  I don't go out of my way to watch football, but now when it's on, I'll watch.)

But Blood Bowl is better.

The gameplay is good, and the various teams have different strengths and weaknesses, rather than just playing with identical, vanilla teams.

It's a lot of fun; I highly recommend it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Definitely the best Games Workshop game!
Everything is present (strategy, chance, evolution of the players through a season), and the dynamics of the game is much better than with 2nd edition. Definitely a must have for those who like Football and tactics

Similar to Necromunda in that it requires only a small number of models and has a campaign element.  Set-up is a lot easier too as there is no terrain.  The gameplay doesn't capture my imagination in the same way as Necromunda though.

This is my favourite edition of Blood Bowl.  Again I had a 4 team league in University for this version.  The guys really got into this one, going out and buying metal minis to match their team (either a proper BB team, or less expensive passable minis).  I bought the Orc team pack with the intention of giving them a cool paint job... they remain unpainted.  Lots of good memories with this game.  Most notably... first game of the season... kickoff roll... a thrown rock... and my friends best player is KILLED.  The dice gods hated him that day and he lost enough players that game that he was only able to field a team of 8 for his second game.

For a 30 year old game, it has held up well. Easy to play and understand. The tactics and overall strategy are still not very clear for me. It is a dice fest and more wargame than anything but it does a great job of simulating this "sport".

Death of the Living Rulebook concept makes this game much less attractive over the long term than it might have been.  Still, league play is great fun.  No other game makes me rage at dicerolls quite like this one.

I played a Blood bowl league a lot of years ago and I realized that I'm the worst player of Blood Bowl, I'm simply awful. But I love the game, I could be watching other players games for hours.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I don't play this game much anymore because I played it to death for about five years (1997-2002) and pretty much got all I could out of it. I took my Skaven team 'Poison Wynd' from scratch through countless leagues and tournaments until every player on the roster was obscenely overpowered. Best result was 17-0 against some Hobgoblins!

This is a great game, not quite the best thing Games Workshop ever produced (that would be Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay), but miles ahead of their other games. A great example of risk management; there's less luck to the game than it appears. Skilled players minimise their dice rolling and maximise their chances when they do have to roll.

Awesome. 

I'll always remember my halfling picking up the ball with a '6', my treeman rolling a '5' to pick up the halfling, rolling a '6' to throw him to the end zone and then............ my halfling landed on his head broke his neck and his back in two places and died. Oh well so close to my first touchdown.

It is a legendary game, mixing the funs of the miniature painting hobby and of boardgames. Every game is a source of laughter, but the tactical side is a very important feature. League and XP systems allow for a lot of customisation and add history to the teams just like a real life sports league. Most importantly, it is perfectly suited for any age, sex, religion and frame of mind!

Blood Bowl literally changed my life and I have played it more than anything else in existence. I have written 8 different "Home-Brew" rulebooks with variations and run leagues which have spanned a decade. I'm not exactly sure how many games I've played but it would easily be 500+.

I love this game, hence the 10. I don't love what GW did with their C&D. However I am rating the game and not the company or it's policies. Has my enthusiasm for the game dropped? You bet. I'm now telling people that want to play/ learn the game not to buy themselves a team but rather to borrow mine.

RATING: 9.5
the best game to build a league around. a single game has tons of strategy, while luck still plays a large part. however, in a league setting, this game really shines as your team and players improve. would be a "10" if played in a league setting... drops a bit if played as one-offs, since you're missing out on so much of what the game has to offer. I think a few of the teams are a bit imbalanced and cumbersome for casual play (I'm talking about you, Nurgle!) and it can be difficult keeping up with rules changes and tweaks, even with the excellent Living Rulebook available -- those are the only things that keep Blood Bowl from being a Perfect 10.

Blood Bowl is probably my all time favorite game, combining fantasy and American football with tons of additional violence! If they would just sell it with painted minis, or even cardboard stand-ups. The third edition is a vast improvement over previous editions, and combined with the new Living Rulebook it's one of the best games ever!

RATING: 7
A good game. Even if I don't see myself playing it anymore, it still gives me good memories. The game could be broken at times though, if you had 9-movement runners with Sprint ability and 4-5 agility, which means you can get a touchdown on turn 1 if you´re not completely deserted by luck. It is also possible to completely obliterate a team by not playing the ball at all. That breaks the league system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Bloodbowl is a lot of fun and third edition is the best printed edition of the game. The Free Living Rulebook online is the ultimate version of this mighty fun game and includes the most interesting teams, balanced rules and the best league play.  My rating there reflects my true love of bloodbowl.

The best edition of Bloodbowl - 1st suffered from &#039;whoever starts with the ball wins&#039; syndrome. This edition gets the right balance of  making plays, but standing a chance of losing the ball. Played many extremely close games that have come down to the last roll of the last move as the decider.

The only miniature game from GW that I still play. I really love it, but you have to play a league otherwise it fells flat after a while.
Unfortunately, to be really appreciated, it requires a group of friends with several different teams, so that you don't find yourself always playing against the same race.

Reprint of Tahuantinsuyu with purty components.  The language-independent cards are more difficult to interpret than the old cards, otherwise the games are identical.  Network-building game with strong elements of opportunism, in that players want to connect to the cities and garrisons built by the other players to score points for their work. Working on cutting people out of segments of the network, thereby denying them such opportunities, is often where the game is at, but it can be difficult to achieve without collusion. The "sun" cards are used in a novel fashion in that they are placed between two players, affecting only them, and are probably my favorite part of the game. Highly interactive.

RATING: 6
Only one play in 4 player but inclined to believe this would work better with 3 as 1 player gets easily left behind in 4 player. Don't think the catch-up mechanism is powerful enough as you don't really struggle for workers. Seems very little way to stop everyone connecting to everything making there little to differentiate players.

[u]Initial impressions[/u]: Like it quite a bit. Runs a little long at 3 hours. The card play is clever and frustrating -- at first glance it seems like there are more negative effects than positive ones, which makes for some confrontational play on the board. There might be a runaway leader problem, but it's too early to say. Once a player has a solid collection of buildings on his route, the points will keep adding up in the Sapa Inca phase. How to blunt that?

Inca Empire is an almost straight re-issue of Tahuantinsuyu, a game I played several times.  It is a network building game in which points are scored for building cities, temples and garrisons at sites you have connected to, and for pacifying regions.  Points are also regularly scored for road connections to developed sites.   The player who best links in to sites that others have built on will likely be the winner.

While I enjoy Inca Empire, I have to confess that it is a little long-winded.  Player turns boil down to placing two roads plus one other action, usually building something.  Event cards add some welcome colour and variation.  I like the way they are placed between two players, effecting both, creating some tricky decisions about what you play and where.  One difference between the two editions is the presence of an additional wilderness road event in Inca Empire (four instead of three).  Given the small deck, the effect of this is noticeable; it feels more difficult to shut an opponent out in Inca Empire.  I don't like that change and may well leave the fourth card out in future games.

The artwork and production quality of the Z-Man edition are a vast improvement.  The double-sided board is really quite beautiful, even if the gradations of colour within a region can be a little confusing.  I understand the decision to switch from text to icons on the cards, though for an English speaker it's a bit of a pain.

RATING: 7
Good network building game. Nice coloufull components. There is a lot of interaction in this game. I liked the mechanic related to the event cards. Each card you play effects 2 players at the same time. The rules are simple enough. It takes around 2 hours to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The game position develops through the building of the roads, cities etc. on the map, and there is a need to share points while also obviously looking for an individual lead. I also liked the special power cards' placement system: your cards affect, for good or ill, two of the players depending on where you place them on the appropriate board, (but later in the turn order you don't have a choice about where to place the card). I definitely would like to play this one again, thoroughly enjoyable, and would consider buying or trading for it.
--
After a second play, I still love it: the network building, the card play, all of it. Even the mechanic where it's advantageous to stay behind the pack (to get first place in turn order) ready to leap ahead at the end, which can annoy me in Power Grid, works really well here. That's partly how I managed to squeak a win on my second play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A spatially interesting game with straightforward building mechanics, engine mechanics, an interesting card placement mechanic, and a good looking board which holds your interest and attention, that plays nicely with 4.  

It does have some issues with game length (particularly if you have players prone to AP) and seemingly too powerful and/or game deciding card effects, dictated substantially by the luck of the draw, not something which I particularly enjoy, or approve of, in a game of this length.

Nevertheless, an interesting game with semi-cooperative elements that seems worth exploring further.  Definitely merits more attention from the BGG community.

Inca Empire, a faithful remake of Tahuantinsuyu, is an interesting network building game.  The central mechanic is a wonderful tradeoff between building infrastructure and leeching off of the infrastructure that others have built.  The game is deeper than it first appears -- there is luck present in the initial setup and the card draws, but it doesn't really have a huge effect on the game.

-- Same rating as Tahuantinsuyu, since IT'S THE SAME GAME --

+ Excellent game. I love how you watch your empire grow. And I love how you can parasite on other players' efforts. The theme is great, too.
- Some people won't like the parasitic aspect of the game. Lost the crayon element of the previous edition which I liked.

RATING: 6
11/12/16: The playing time is woefully incorrect. Our 4 player game took 5 hours which included about an hour of setup and instruction.  I can see this getting down to 3 hours, but not 90-120 minutes as described on the side of the box.

The game feels too swingy for me.  I think that the cards are overpowered and deal a lot of randomness.  You can mitigate them a bit, but how the cards come out really can affect the endgame and overwhelm a winning strategy.  I think that for a four hour game that's a  problem for me and I don't like how much the luck of the card draw affects things.  We also played with the variable end timing, and again the end game timing was a bigger factor than play strategy.

At the beginning of the game one person was saying how much they enjoyed the game and that it ought to come out more often to be played, and by the end of the game this same person was ready to put their copy up for sale.   It's a bit of a shame as I had been looking forward to trying this for several years, but one play rid me of any desire to rush out and purchase the game until I've played it more, which I'm not sure is going to happen.

The iconography is such that you'll spend the whole game looking up cards on your first play.  I think that for some of them they could have put text on the cards.

I expect that if there was an new edition is would address a lot of my concerns.

A játék szép és profi kivitelezésű, a téma egyedi és jó, a 2 oldalas tábla is tuti, és van benne egy ötletes mechanizmus, a kártyák lehelyezése, amivel a játékosok újszerű módon hathatnak egymásra. Kb. ennyi a pozitívum.
De sajnos több a negatívum. A nagy ötlet, amit ki is emeltem pozitívumként fentebb, sajnos elég furcsán működik (talán 3-an jó lehet, 4-en nem nagyon tetszett), mert nem tudok bármilyen kombinációban befolyásolni játékpárosokat (megjegyzem, ha 4 helyett 6 lehetőség lenne, akkor ez megoldódna). Így van olyan rivális, akin egyszerűen képtelenség hozni, ha előnyre tett szert. Hacsak nem játszanak többen össze:) Ehhez kapcsolódik, hogy a játék kb. a felénél eldőlhet, szinte lehetetlen megfordítani a trendet, a gyengébbek kompenzálása teljesen jelentéktelen hatású a játék közepe felé. Kifejezetten unalmassá válik a közepe felé, mivel semmi új nem kerül a játékba végig, túl statikus. A teraszoknak kicsi a szerepe, feleslegesnek tűnnek. Néhány kártya túl erős szerintem (pl. amivel bárhova lehet építeni utat). Van egy rész, ami a sorrend kialakításában is logikátlannak tűnik (aki hátrébb van, az lesz a következő körben előrébb, de ha egymás mellett állunk, akkor mégse...). Erőltetett az úthálózat kialakítás, és az ehhez kapcsolódó szabályok kicsit esetlegesek, kaotikusak...Ide lóg az út, oda lóg, felesleges túlbonyolítások, teljesen az volt az érzésem (érzésünk), hogy egy teszteletlen játékról van szó. És mindennek a teteje, hogy hosszú is. Én tolerálom a hosszú játékokat, sőt amilyen hülye vagyok, pozitív előítéletem van a hosszabb játékokkal szemben. De ez a játék nem ér meg 3-4 órát. Tudom, hogy 1 parti alapján nem illik elítélni egy játékot sem, de ezzel én nem akarok többet játszani. Majd egyszer talán, nagyon soká.... Pedig szép volt, és a szabály alapján még reménykedtem, de valahogy sejtettem, hogy nem lesz minden oké:)

The game is clever and very unique, and has a lot of interaction between players.
The map and the other components are beautiful, but the map is quite difficult to "read" correctly, and every scoring phase is painful.
The first play overstayed its welcome a little, and we had a runaway leader problem. But everything would probably be fixed without some minor rules misplays, and it surely needs some more plays for a thoughtful evaluation.

Initial Impression: This is a fairly abstract game with a very euro feel to it. It has an interesting mechanism in that your actions will help your opponents, so you want to minimize how much you help them while maximizing how much you help yourself. This is a good game for very non-confrontational players.

Very well designed networking/building game. The components are beautifully designed but unfortunately not always clear. The game has a pretty steep learning curve and you can expect a first game to last up to 4 hours instead of the 90 minutes stated on the box. But in my opinion it is time well spent. Others may think this game outstays it's welcome because even with experience, I don't see the playing time going below 150 minutes. There are so many choices for the players and the possible strategies can become overwhelming. But in the end this game is about building an effective network and scoring as much unique points for yourself as possible. The key seems to be to prevent others from leaching on you too much. How to pursue this is a whole other matter. As blocking seems to be almost impossible due to the wilderness roads. The sun cards add some spice to the game and are part of a much needed catch the leader mechanic. I'm not convinced that works so well but more plays will have to prove if I'm correct on that. For now Inca Empire has caught my attention and I'm itching to get it to the table again.

This is a solid nine and I recommend that it be played with the surprise ending variant.  The reason I suggest this variant is to force gamers to make there best moves all the time and not simply plan stuff for the last move of the game.  Because gamers are spread out over a large map it is possible that a player has the game sown up because he has the cards and game position on his opponents.  I plyed a 3 player game and it was very good.  I believe that this would be a harder game with 4 players and better.

A connection game where it seems like it could be better to wait and build roads before building cities, etc.  At least some of the time.  I enjoyed the card play of this where a card affects two different people when played and it stays for the whole round.  It's unique and really made this much easier than it looked game.  I'm glad I got to play and it teeters, after the first play on good to really good.  I love the artwork on the board, as well.

Another that I struggled with at first, but as I grow more comfortable i'm enjoying it alot more (and succeeding alot more). Deeply strategic, great growth and expansion element that is essential to game-play. The interaction with other players is non-confrontational, but not quite cooperative either (an interesting twist). Want to sink my teeth into this one a little more.

 It was a good game. Teaching it is easy. Actions are intuitive. Definitely need to not go off by yourself. I think this can be difficult if both E and W go North. What does South do? In our game, E went North and W went North and South. So early on, South felt comfortable exploring south and later he was screwed as a result. The card interaction is nasty. I really liked that. Figuring out when to hang back and when to thrust forward is critical. Those pilgrimage cards can be huge points. Lots of catch-up mechanisms, possibly too many.

A decent "train" game where connecting to every city, garrison and temple is critical.

Clocking in at three hours is a bit long for what it is.  

In our three player game, the orange player's starting position seemed disadvantaged.

The seeding of the sun cards is what elevates this game to a higher level of game play.

The game may be anti-climatic two-thirds through as a leader is near impossible to unseat. Once someone is connected in to every location, then he's likely to stay the winner. 

The components and board are quite nice.

This game may warrant an occasional play.

Some interesting mechanics and interesting theme but

Took an hour too long with four and most of the time one just waited for his turn to come without any interest what's happening on the board by other players. Maybe the shorter variant solves some of the problems and makes the game more attracting for me?

Very cool game that seems to have some familiar mechanisms, but manages to feel very unlike anything I've played.

I really enjoyed the sun cards, which have various game effects on each player for the remainder of the round.  Very cool way of helping/hindering the players.

The turn order mechanisms also felt very Power Grid-ish, in that having the most points is usually a fairly significant advantage, so timing when (and when not) to take the lead can be fairly important.

Other than that, everything just works very slick!  You need to build a bit of an engine to produce workers, and then send those workers out there to build stuff for points to win the game.

Overall, very good stuff!  This one's a keeper!

This is a tremendous 4-player (only) game.  Only losing half a point because I don't think it's for 3, and also there's a little bit of fragility if someone doesn't know what they're doing and then plays kingmaker, But with roughly equally skilled players, it's amazing.  A delicate balancing act in helping and hindering others in just the right proportions.  Also, fairly straightforward rules.  First game took about 3.25 hours.  A winner!

RATING: 8
Rated 8 after one play. But if I'm honest, I thought it was a nine. My fellow gamers had mixed opinions, so I'm tempering the rating a bit.

My good friend likened this to "Transamerica for gamers." And, that's a pretty apt description. The laying of routes is very similar to Transamerica, but the rest of the game involves dealing with events cards and maneuvering to mooch points off others. I really like this combination. It's a slim set of rules, but plenty of decisions that stem from them. There's opportunity for blocking opponents and making clever plays to circumvent others.

One play is probably not enough to assess, due to the cards. After one game, my group wanted to "fix" the cards, either by drafting, or handing out a standard set to each player, or changing them, etc. I personally liked the cards, and the fact that we sifted through the deck at least four or five times means most players will get to see cards they need. For the pilgrimage cards, two players held onto those cards... one for a long-term strategy, the other to deny other players. Is that a flaw? I dunno--but I'm willing to play this again to see if prior knowledge improves the opinion of our collective group. Hopefully we give this one another shot.

Update: another play, and I'm bumping this up to a 9. For me, this 2nd play alleviated any concerns about the cards. Once you learn the game, you know what's in the deck, and it's a small deck that gets cycled through a number of times. The pilgrimage cards are not broken at all; they offer a bit of balance to the outer regions of the map. It adds to the clever card play.

I'm really digging this game. Between the routes/networks, the "card quadrant," the numerous decisions, and the beautiful board, I just think this game is a winner.

Update: it had been more than three years since I last played this game, and I almost had it in a trade pile. I'm glad I got the chance to play this again--it's a keeper. I was reminded how cool the gameplay is with the need to work with other players... just enough.

RATING: 7
Good connections/blocking game but a bit too long for what it is.

The cards add a random take-that element that isn't suited to a long heavy eurogame like this (The -1 road build card caused huge swings in our game). The starting positions also look like they will always cause at least one player to fall behind with no chance of catching up. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There are two types of points in this game - yours and shared. Conquests, terraces, temple building, and pilgrimages are the primary means of scoring 'your' points. Forts and cities are typically going to be 'family pots'. Most of the persistent scoring comes from the shared items, so scoring rounds tend to be pretty tightly fought despite the outpouring of points. Ultimately, the game seems to be a balance of not getting left out of the family pots, having some of them to yourself for a scoring round or two, making the most of your actions to get your solo points when you can.

So on this pretty basic framework of maximization of scoring on each and every turn, there hang some interesting baubles. The mechanism for playing the sun cards is quiet neat; each player plays a card that affects two players, depending on the quadrant selected. However, the randomness of the cards makes planning moves a bit more  imprecise than I would typically like. That said, they do add the texture that makes this game different and enjoyable. Because of the dense network of potential paths and the abundance of scoring opportunities, there is usually a consolation plan if the cards hose you.

Another lovely little feature is the worker balance of the conquest tokens - do you go for the high point value ones with few workers while they are still around (and you need the workers pretty badly), or do you try and wait and hope that people are distracted by other scoring opportunities.

Overall, I enjoyed this game on the same level as Brass (although they are two very different games). A very enjoyable workout, but ultimately a bit too much of a point-squeezing puzzle to beg to get in heavy rotation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
While not without flaws but both interesting and rather deeper than it first appears.  This is very much a game of riding coattails and of (not-always-so-)minor positional advantages.  

A pleasant, even somewhat soothing game.

The flaws are easily isolated: The "Rural Unrest" cards are excessively capricious and the random game-ending forces jarringly tactical short term considerations into an otherwise fine planning game.  Both may be removed easily enough.

Update: 5 games in and it has been growing one me.  Rating raised half a point to 8.  For all the random caprice in the card draws, card plays and road building, there's an even larger dose of subtlety and inferential control play.

Update: 10 games in.  There's no need to tolerate the random ending.  Just toss the discs and always have the last epoch have 4 Sun/People phases.

After a first play I find it difficult to say where this game would end up would I play several more times. I like the general idea behind it all: I have never really played a road building (or crayon) game before, and there are all sorts of interesting possibilities lurking inside this mechanism. In Inca Empire the author has chosen to turn the game into an elaborate race with the players attempting to create networks with important nodes; constructing something on those nodes as well as connecting later to them brings you points. There is a rather nice balance between attempting to strike out on your own and siphoning off other player's efforts here, although the latter activity will not bring you victory unless your road network is [i]really[/i] extensive. (The players doing the constructing get those 'siphon points' too, so you need to be connected to much more nodes than the others.) So far the game is, in my experience, refreshing.

Then there are cards which influence the abilities of the players. The author has seen fit to couple the playing of a card (either with positive or negative effects) to [i]two[/i] players simultaneously, which means that players face different obstacles and are awarded different bonuses throughout the turns. I'm not really sure about this aspect. The cards you get are randomly drawn, and you only get to select from a small number. There aren't many options to consider, nor do they really lead to interesting variations. At best, they're useful in a pinch (the ‘wild roads’ come to mind); at worst they're annoying for a short while (removing roads in unconquered territory). The fact that the cards are added cumulatively means that there is an increasing number of them laying open with effects cancelling and adding to at the same time. I found this part of the game is too confusing and gamey, especially as the number of cards grew.

Finally, I felt the game was taking too long. There isn't that much variation in what you can do as player, and then the sheer number of the numerous phases begins to feel rather artificial. Had there been more options besides temples, cities, garrisons and terraces, then players would have had something to do in the latter part of the game. There is a variant in the rules for a shorter game; and I think I would prefer the game with that variant in play.

All in all the first game was a pleasant one, but with a few rough spots I'm not entirely sure about yet. I'm being cautious with my rating as a consequence.

[b]Update[/b] The second game, in a relaxed environment with the uncertain end, was a positive experience, more so than the initial one I based the bulk of the comment on. What I hadn't realised is that Inca Empire is a game of point deltas and that you must be very careful in letting someone get more points that way. At the same time, blocking access to sites is hard to accomplish on your own, so the most obvious way of catching up requires some cooperation. All in all there seems to be more than meets the eye to this game. Increased the rating, and looking forward to further plays.

I believe the 3-player variant is an afterthought. This is really a 4-player game - it makes sense thematically, visually (and in every other possible way) and it's balanced better this way. Still, with 4 players it's a great game, especially if you get into the historical theme. It has the same ingenuity that Pandemic has - there are just a few simple mechanisms here, but they do a great job representing the subject. Also, this is a very interactive game, and I like that.

Inca Empire is a great game, with two things to think about.  There are plenty of build actions to choose from, and laying out the roads can be fun.  There are also a lot of cards that modify what players are allowed to do during different phases of the game.  These all keep the game fresh while you are choosing from the list of options available on your turn.  
The first problem with the game is that it is too long.  Toward the end of the game the players are crawling all over each other on the map.  Players end up sharing the same scoring opportunities way too much.  I understand that this is part of the theme, but I feel that it is over-done, and lessens the quality of the game.
The last two scoring rounds had all of our players scoring nearly the identical scores.
The second thing to think about is how the game handles player order.  The player with the point lead goes last each round, while the player with the lowest score goes first.  This actually gives an advantage to the player who is already in the lead because of how the scoring rounds work.  The lead player does have to give workers to the trailing player, but I don't think the balance is quite right.  The lead player does have a little less to choose from, but all the shared scoring (and plentiful build sites) doesn't seem to matter much.
If these two items didn't nag me, This would be a fantastic game.  As it is, I would say that it is a very good game.

3-4 players w/ 2 player option
I'm actually thinking of playing this as a 2-player game in a couple of days. I don't have many heavier 2-player games - but have a friend coming over.
I figured the easiest thing to do would be to use the 4 player board and have each player take 2 empires/colors (the opposites). You could combine workers and your hand of cards for simplicity, and at the end of the game you just total your score for your two empires. Each empire would take its turn in normal order, and you'd have to chose how to balance your use of workers across them.
TAHUANTINSUYO is a cheaper version

Picked it up after the reprint improved on the components (I'm not one for coloring on boards or plexiglass).  Pretty good game after first play (4-er).  Unique card play system as well as scoring system as you build buildings that others can mooch off of.  Rating likely to go up after further plays.

Update: Bumping up rating after 2nd 4-player game. This game is just plain fun brain-burning. Happy to play it any time.

Played it once 3 player, and I am glad to find it has the same feel as the 4-player. 

Excellent game, but don't be fooled by the catch up mechanic. If you fall too far behind, even the extra labor tokens won't be enough to help you out of the slump. Don't underestimate road-building. This game is all about your network and connecting to everything you can on the board.

Very unique game.   Route building without pickup and deliver, and without 'blocking' found in most games like this.   The wilderness roads virtually guarantee you can get where you want to go, and sharing buildings with other players is a necessity.  It actually reminds me of Metro and Cable Car more than Steam or Railroad Tycoon.  Cut the game length in half and it would be better.   Needs to be played with the Expansion Cards, Pizzaro Ending, and 'Hands of the Gods' to see what those do to the feel of the game.

First play was a painful process.  We got some rules wrong and started over.  Then we found some more rules we got wrong and just put the game away.  We all agreed to try it again.   I don't think the game is really as bad as a "5"...but this is where it stands now.

If we can get it to the table again, I expect the rating to go up a point or 2.  I don't see it going higher than 7 though.

Inca Empire is the rerelease of a somewhat obscure game, Tahuantinsuyu, released in 2004 by Hangman games. Less than 500 people own it and there are a little less than 350 ratings. I find it to be a very interesting game, with plenty of opportunities for parasitic or symbiotic play, different ways to win, and enough initial game state randomness to provide interesting variance between plays. 

In Inca Empire, individual players each represent one of the four Apus responsible for extending the influence of the Inca Empire, starting at Cuzco and extending outward in one of four directions. The primary way that this expansion happens is through roads which the player draws onto whatever transparent substance you prefer to use on the board. As they move through these areas individuals are able to use their labor supply to conquer the randomly distributed native peoples (which provides some sort of combination of labor per turn and victory points), build communally accessed cities, garrisons, and temples (which provide both initial lump sums of victory points one shot and then victory points per turn), build personally owned terraces (which provide labor and victory points), and build additional extra roads. 

While these aspects by themselves are pretty straightforward, what adds additional texture to the game, and makes it feel particularly intriguing are how both victory point generation works. Cities, Garrisons, and Temples each provide a lump sum of victory points each turn. While the person who builds them will get these victory points, they do not own the structures. Instead, each one provides these victory points to anyone who builds their road system such that they connect to these locations, thus encouraging parasitic play. Individual players can build roads in such a way that other players are blocked (or at least severely hindered) from getting to any specific location, but usually that requires enough effort that it is not necessarily worthwhile to do so. 

Tahuantinsuyu’s card play also adds nuance to the game, helping to make it greater than its part. During one of the game’s phases, called the Sun phase, individual players each are able to play one of three cards from their hand. What makes this card play interesting is that you are never able to target just one person (including yourself) with these cards. So any beneficial effects you play are going to be shared and negative effects can potentially hit two opponents. However, your ability to effect who you will affect by these cards is limited by your position in turn order. As during any given sun phase no more than one card can be played between two players, this may end up being potentially very painful if you end up with three negative cards and only the ability to play a card next to yourself or a positive card next to an opponent. 

Turn order is determined by relative victory point position. Whoever has the least amount of victory points goes first; whoever has the 3rd most goes 2nd, and so on. Relative victory point totals also matter during the labor generation phases, as those in greater victory point positions are forced to give labor to those who are farther back. This is perhaps the only thing that bothers me about the game. I am not a fan of artificial catch-up mechanisms, but did not bother me that much in my play of this game. We will see if it does so over time like Power Grid and Scepter of Zavandor did. 

So in conclusion, I greatly enjoyed Inca Empire/ Tahuantinsuyu and intend to get the component upgraded Inca Empire when it is released. If you like route building games or those which feature symbiotic and parasitic relationships between players I recommend you check it out. Even if it is not to your taste, you should find yourself entertained for your play of it.

I like the leaching strategy and how you have to try and plan your network around it, as well as what you actually want to build yourself.  And I like the sun cards and how they prevent it becoming too predictable.

Hmmm, the game is promising but seems to be marred by several flaws.

First off, the game starts off promisingly. I like the idea of pacifying areas before building infrastructure (to civilise the place). And you get to score points for doing these things. But then the game degenerates into sneaking in connections just to score 1-3 points (and if you have the wilderness road capability, that becomes so much easier). Unfortunately, it's not very compelling.

Would also probably like it a lot better if it was shorter. There seems to be a deep level of strategy but it's spoiled by some random elements which could derail the game. Random placement of tribes can cause imbalance, which is not good for a long game. Some of the cards, which are distributed randomly, also seem overly powerful, like those giving players a slew of VPs in exchange for forgoing an action or wilderness route actions.

An enigmatic game for me. It started at 9 then went to 8 and now sits at a 7. I can't figure out if good play really wins this game or if it's musical chairs and the winner is decided by the music stopping. That's a bit of an exaggeration, but my point is that it's one of those experiences where you leap-frog points all game and just hope you're on the farthest lilly pad by the end of the game. 

The card-play is fascinating and the main attraction here. I just love that aspect of it. It's the emphasis  on route building and counter-intuitiveness of building that hangs me up. It seems like the better ploy in the game is to build routes and not buildings as the person who leeches the most off others seems to do best. I'll have to try out a strategy of building 3 roads/turn next time to see if this is valid or not.

As I said, it's an enigma for me. Part of me wants to like it and another part feels like there's a lot of point-mongering for three hours that doesn't ultimately lead to a satisfying conclusion as to who outplayed the others.

The card play really changes the game--just as you have your strategy planned, someone can mess it up.  

Early on I desperately needed more workers that others had, and later in the game I finally got the workers--but didn't use them because all I built was roads!  

Turn order important in this game.  Also, a nice method for breaking ties.

Our first play was a ton of fun.  I very much enjoyed the symbiotic play and the card mechanic was always entertaining.  I have some pretty huge reservations, though.  I worry the catch-up mechanisms and difficulty in differentiating oneself from the others makes you feel a bit like you're just treading water for most of the game.  I also feel El Grande suffers from this, so take that as a positive or negative depending on your disposition.  If I feel my moves are significant enough in the early and midgame, this could easily go to a 9, but if not, I could see it dropping to where I'd only reluctantly play.  What a great looking board.

Oh! This is SO under rated here! But to me, it's a blast!
Inca Empire is based on the pre colonial history of the Andean part of South America. The the game is centered on the expansion of the Incas, the most prosperous pre colonial civilization of South America who expanded their empire at the expense of  minor native American cultures. If you want medium/high interaction level games, this is one for you. If you want a game that works excellent for four players, this is one for you. Its game mechanics are brilliant and its components are really top notch and are well designed and beautifully ilustrated.

Negative interaction pure. I preferably play other types of games but this one is actually pretty good and fun. The huge con is that it scales down badly and it's practically only a four-player game.

Excellent route building, VP-mooching game that combines euro sensibilities of timing and money management with mild take-that (or bequeath that, as the case may be) card play. Some randomness with the cards and region chips, but not enough to cause concern. 

Ignore the box. With four, this game will take at least 2.5 hours. Probably 3.

Inca Empire is a strategy game for 3 or 4 player.  Each player is a Inca leader that tries to increase his status in the eyes of the emperor by doing the best job in expanding and improving the empire.
I like the help in this game to the last place player, not only will the turn order be to his advantage, but the first place player also have to give him some of his worker.
I also like the sun phase in this game where each player choose a card (some are good, some are bad) that will affect 2 player.
I also like the scoring mechanic.  You get point for building things but you also get points for each building on your road network.

Pwhee, it's long. A long, intricate, and somewhat inscrutable game at first blush. As is becoming the standard for these things, it has a card deck of unique or nearly unique special power cards that are rendered incomprehensible by an arcane set of hieroglyphs. This is really starting to become a pet peeve for me. Publishers, please, if you have to make games this way, include multiple copies of the card manifests/translations so everyone can play without constantly passing the rule book back and forth. 

Once you get past that, there's a couple pretty interesting systems here. The board play consists mostly of building and scoring where often the best play is to jump in and benefit from the buildings and networks of others. It makes for a very claustrophobic game, with everyone's networks turning into a knotted mess. You think that board looks big? It's not. The other interesting bit is the card play where each card affects two players at a time, sometimes you and an opponent, sometimes just two opponents. The choices to be made here are pretty interesting, once you've properly deciphered the cards.

I would play it again, but the learning game took all of 4 hours. At 2 hours I'd be pretty pleased with it, but I suspect normal play time will be around 2 1/2 hours which is still on the long side for what you get here. We'll see.

GREAT potential.  Sadly, unfulfilled.  Biig pity..

Everything is ok except the fact the game is insanely random.  Innovative event board is the greatest strength and the greatest weakness at the same time..  You can get horrible or extremely favourable events and you have almost nothing to say about this... (the most glaring (but not only) example being Wilderness Road -> it's crazy and ruins the game.. - BUT you can't remove it or limit the number of it without effectively hurting the game -- this is just madness).

Good design - I like the tension between conquest and scoring points, and I like the decisions the card play forces (at least on the first three players).

The board all starts to blur to me though, a mess of roads and cities and temples and garrisons.  I feel like I'm just playing tactically, and that I'm rarely able to plan more than a move or two ahead.  Probably this is because I'm not that good at the game yet, but also the tactics here are just the sort of spatial-relations stuff that causes my brain to burn.

I'll probably need to try this once more.  I think it's a good game but not really my thing.

Players are Incan lords trying to expand and develop their part of the Incan empire better than the other players. Players get points for conquering territories, building cities, garrisons and temples, and being connected to those locations, whomever built them. Players can also play cards that affect two players, either positively or negatively, and creates a certain variability on what you are able to accomplish from turn to turn. Every turn players extend their network of roads and either conquer a territory or build something. Income comes primarily in the form of labor from conquered territories. That's right. The currency of this game is human sweat.

The game play is interesting. It's part race to get the premium locations before your opponents. It's managing your income so that you are not limited in your actions. The cards throw in a bit of chance and the ability to directly mess with your opponents. I liked the game. My main concern is the ability to be competitive if someone gets an early advantage. It is unforgiving in that regard. I'm usually fine with unforgiving games, like Age of Steam, but somehow this game feels a bit hopeless when you get behind and there isn't quite enough choices for those who are behind to even give the illusion of competitiveness. I'm interested in playing the game a few more times to see if most games follow this pattern. There are a few catch-up mechanics, but they are pretty weak. If more play reinforces this pattern, I'd probably drop the score a notch and trade it.

Some interesting things going here. Emerging semi-partnerships; parasitic route building; unique sun cards mechanic. However, the game runs about 90 minutes too long and by the second round the incremental scoring gets tiresome. 

UPDATE:

Potential runaway leader problem. In each of our sessions the eventual winner takes the lead near the end of the second era and never relinquishes it. As no one can un-connect you from a location (as long as areas are conquered), a player can remain there for good, rack up VPs, and snowball there way to victory.

This is a good route building game where all players can use routes to get victory points on cities or temples you built. All building for the inca empire. The sun card mechaninc is quite good and allows the play of affects from cards to apply to two colors (players) only. I think this is a good game.

RATING: 7
I'm not spoiled with connection games of this type, so it was no surprise I would enjoy it. A few things prevent me from gushing. First, the game aggressively and heavy-handedly punishes the point leader, and the effect is felt most strongly at the beginning where points are an indicator of choosing short-term gains over long-term gains and therefore [i]not doing well[/i]. When teaching the game the necessity of tailoring your early actions to fit the situation on the score track cannot be overstressed; trying to get an "early point lead" will leave you with neither points nor resources. Second, the event cards can be extremely swingy, ranging from the situationally useless or inconsequential through the generally beneficial up to the all-powerful Wilderness Road. In particular, a Wilderness Road card played early in a long year will make an astounding difference, and if a player gets shut out of wilderness roads in the last couple of years they surely cannot win. Swinginess is not lessened by the non-negligible chance that a player may be forced to play a beneficial card on their opponents. Third, the rules for wilderness roads are full of holes and ambiguities and effectively must be houseruled in order to play. Rating could certainly go up with proven replayability and of course I would also like to try it with four.

Surprisingly light and long game. The latter is a problem, since getting lucky or unlucky in the early game can have a huge influence on the final outcome, with some player(s) effectively out of the game from round one. At least 1/3 of the game length should be cut. Nothing special otherwise either so not a big hit for me.

Currently suffering through my first play of those game. Perhaps my dislike of it is colored by the apparent foul mood at the table, but I do not find it enjoyable. The other players have said repeatedly that it is "easy" and the moves are obvious, however I find it tedious and confusing. All around, this has not been a fun game.

Gamers who enjoy resource/economy management and games that have something of a "screw you" element may find this game enjoyable.

I finally played this game which had been waiting in my board game shelf for 1.5 yrs. We played the 4-player version. It took us 150 minutes to finish as we had to study the rules quite a lot. The weakest point is probably the too dense grid of paths, making getting to almost any site pretty easy. Pushed by the four-direction in a narrow belt map (real based), the game also quickly divides to two pairs of players going to different dirrections, interacting mainly between themselves (only sun phase cards make it possible to influence the other two as well). Not bad, though. Just the playing time makes you think twice before you start playing.

In my evaluation, the most interesting aspect of this game are the sun cards and how they are played to affect two people in the game.  Road building and creating a good network is also important but not nearly as interesting outside of the race to connect to other people's buildings to leach off points.  The game does a good job of creating the sense of wanting to do more than you are allowed on your turn.  While early in the game you might want to work with your opponents, there is definitely a point at which you want to try and block others from connecting to your buildings.

I played the original game years and years ago, but remember nothing about it. May as well be new to me. This is a really good game. There's a lot going on but it's not overwhelming, it's got an interesting push-pull with regards to dealing with other players, and the gameplay is fairly well matched to the theme. This one deserves to get a lot more attention. It should be considered part of the boardgame canon.

RATING: 7
The production quality of the Z-Man games version is excellent.  All the artwork on the boards and cards has an "Incan" influence.  In addition to the great artwork, the board and cards are very functional.  As for the game mechanics, it's definitely about building networks and connecting them to other players' networks to "sponge" off them. Trying to build in isolation - either through the other players neglecting you or through deliberately blocking them - is a good way to fall behind.  I really like the simple mechanics and the player interaction. In the case of the latter, it's not in-your-face, raw competition; it's more subtle through card play and "sponging" off other player's builds. And though the mechanics are simple, the game has plenty of depth.  Too bad it just never gets to the table.

Very interesting game. It's a blend of co-op and competitive empire expansion. It's impossible for you to really expand your portion of the empire without offering up some sort of support to others or without taking advantage of other players areas. But at the same time you are trying to selectively limit the amount of access the other players have of your portion of the empire. Their is strategy involved, there is slight screwing over of others, and none of it feels over the top or constricting.

Neat route building game where cooperation is needed to outrun those not cooperating but at some point you've got to try to earn more points on the side than you're leaching off your buddies.

Must play with the variable ending in my opinion as that last turn is a bit long trying to connect to each other as much as possible.

The artwork is nicely done.

A train game in disguise?  Inca Empire meshes route building with an interesting set of collaborative mechanics where players can earn points off each other’s improvements.  The Sun Phases keeps the gameplay varied by having players play special power cards that affect multiple opponents, creating create risk-reward choices in who to affect.  Wonderful production value and gorgeous board!

12/11/10 Played a four player game. I found Inca Empire interesting. I give it credit for its unusual theme. Though I laughed out loud at the "90 to 120 minutes" duration estimation the side of the box. Even with experienced players I can't see it being played by four in less than three hours.There are *way* too many things to consider each turn. Possible road segment placements usually number in the 10 to 20 range of possible combinations each turn. I do have some issues with the graphics. Many was the time someone would think one region was two, because the developer had tried to incorporate color variations within a region to represent mountainous terrain. This made half a region a darker shade of blue or cream than the other. And since all regions were either white, cream, light blue, or medium blue, more variations on this theme only lead to confusion. My other graphics quibble is many of the Sun Event cards are too similar. We had several instances of someone mistaking a "helping" card for a "hurting" card and shooting themselves in the foot or giving an opponent a boon unintentionally. There should have been some sort of icon, like a green star for "help" and a red star for "hurt" on each card, to cut down on this confusion. Also, having the score track go to 120 instead of 100 was an annoyance, as we all got way past that mark. So in end game scoring we had to add 120 to, say 53, to get someone's final score. I think that's silly, and could have been easily remedied by making the spaces larger. Its an OK game. But 4.2 hours of it after a 50 minute explanation grew tedious. So I think I'll only be able to take it about once every 12 months.

Not a bad game, but the obsession with language independence means the iconography leaves a lot to be desired. I was confused more than once, meaning I often played a card that benefitted my opponents when I meant to penalise them, and played cards meant to benefit me, but ended up penalising myself.

The game is not co-operative, but it does seem to require that players work together to some extent: those striking out on their own are likely to find themselves falling behind as it's only by piggy-backing on others that you can really progress efficiently.

A clever game in some ways, but it feels a bit dry to me, hence not one I'll play regularly.

Well the problem is not the game it s the poor rulebook esp.  the german edition is full of mistakes. What s so dramatically difficult to bring in all special cases for road building as examples.

This and the length of the game are the reasons why I ll not keep it. Tahu..... was easier because Alan was sitting at the table and no rules discussions came up, but that was 10 years ago

Very nice game. Excellent production, clear rules, simple mechanics, a number of choices but not overwhelming, strategic route building game and sustaining the empire with cities, garrisons and temples. Game flow is smooth but beware of analysis paralysis to keep the game moving. I like the variable Pizarro arrival rule which means you have to hedge your bets a bit. Interaction due to Sun cards which can help or hinder and potential to connect into each others routes is a good thing. My main concern is that it can be too long. suggest that you set a time limit for turns.

Inca Empire is interesting but falls a little flat for me. While I don't think "luck" is a big factor, there is a lot of chaos, as the board is constantly changing and you never know what Sun Cards you'll draw or be dealing with on the next turn. Thus, the game becomes largely tactical, just making the most of your situation on any given turn. Although you can make mistakes, I never felt that I was faced with any really tough decisions. I imagine we'll get another couple plays out of this one, and then it will be gone.

Good.

If the game ended in 1.5 instead of 3 hours, didn't have a degenerate endgame, and wasn't one more of those games [like Caylus, et al] where you end with a score of ~150-200 which you accumulated 1 to 4 points at a time, it might be great. 

I always feel in games like this that have [i]so many[/i] scoring rounds / opportunities and so small a margin of victory [from first to last: less than 10%] that the playing of the game had no effect on the winning of the game, which is pretty much dumb.

I feel like there's a really good game in there somewhere - love the sun card mechanic especially - but the game goes on far too long and the cards are very unbalanced - getting certain cards at the right times (like the pilgrimages for example) is a huge and almost insurmountable advantage.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've only played this once, but I'm rating it so high because it is a game that I definitely want to play again. Very interesting mechanics that I haven't seen in other games.

First, the point of the game is to build a road network that is connected to valuable buildings, which score victory points at certain times during the game. You get points for creating these buildings, but you also get points for merely connecting to them. So, you can get points by connecting your road to your opponent's buildings. 

Second, there are Sun Cards that are played on a side board, divided into segments. This is laid out in a way that each card played will affect two players. If you're playing a bad card you can hit two of your opponents (at least, in the 4 player version). But if you play a good card you will be helping out yourself and an opponent. 

Update: Downgraded from 7.5 to a 7. It's been years since I've played this. The fact that it's 3-4 players, somewhat lengthy and requires a decent bit of explanation has probably contributed. Haven't felt compelled to go to the trouble.

Played: 2 times.

I generally enjoy games where the players interact by building upon what others do rather than simple take that and find Inca Empire's idea of building on other player' networks interesting. Consequently, the idea of playing cards affecting other players appeals less to me but I still want to see how this plays. The unusual theme and my fond memories of a Peru visit further strengthens my wish.

Un bel gioco con tanta interazione e meccaniche interessanti. A dispetto dell'ambientazione più che un gioco di civilizzazione mi sembra un ferroviario.

Tra i difetti ci metto i materiali (legnetti piccolissimi e grafica un po' incasinata) ma soprattutto l'eccessiva lunghezza (con pensatori); il gioco dovrebbe terminare almeno un'Era prima senza appesantire troppo la partita che a mio avviso nelle ultime fasi si trascina.

[b]Inca Empire[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6/8):[/COLOR]

[i]I initially heard of the game because I was looking for games the artist, Alexandre Roche, had worked on. I stumbled upon Inca Empire and was intrigued, but I knew this game wouldn't see the light of day if I bought it. Fast forward a few years and I got to play it at a con with a group I only meet up with while there. 

In short it is a route building game, with card play. Everything came together to create a very engaging, yet difficult, puzzle to solve. There was a lot I liked about the game, turn order is decided by who is first on the VP track which always makes jumping into the lead dangerous as you are not able to react to what other folks are doing. Card play is handled well, you can effect yourself or others with your play. However; two players are always effected by each card so you have to figure out what the best play for you is while taking into consideration how it'll effect other players.  

There is one major problem I have that holds it back for me, scoring is insane later in the game. Since there are so many routes and buildings on the board by the mid point of the game it really becomes a hassle to figure out scores and it'd be quite easy to miss count points during the game. It would be great if there was some way to track each players temples, forts and cities without having to refer to the board. You could definitely home brew something so it is not an insurmountable problem and it wouldn't stop me from playing again.

Inca Empire is a long game, but that didn't bother me at all. Turns were usually quick and you have a lot to think about between turns and you can start planning what you may want to do. There is so much more to the game, so if you enjoy heavier Euros I'd check this one out. It is not a game I'd want to play often, but I'd be happy playing it a few times a year. [/i]

Rating is for our own homebrewed ruleset that makes all sun cards only last for a single building round, not through to scoring.

Instead of random event cards affecting everyone/randomly chosen players, players control who events will affect, but each card affects a pair of adjacent players. This is a big improvement over peoples positions just blowing up at random, but I'm not convinced the cards add all that much to the game. 

The rest of the game is okay, most of the VPs can be leeched: let other people build and you connect in. It is very hard to have things just to yourself, to some extent you just have to build knowing you will share things and accept it.

Exactly the same as Tahuantinsuyu except for better bits, so same rating and same comment, being: The rules are surprisingly easy with little chrome. Players set off on their own paths to establish wealth and victory point claims. The main decision is how much do you hang around the other players and leech off their victory point buildings (usual answer: a lot) and how far do you expand away from the other players to build your own buildings and make it difficult for the others to leech off you (if you can whilst leeching as well). The card play between each pair of players, so it only affects both of them and no else, provides a clever decision point for hitting other players or helping yourself. The cards also provide you with strategic direction, where you can prepare turns ahead to take advantage a card you've been dealt from the start. Other than that it's fairly tactical, taking advantage of what other players build as you can, but I've enjoyed each game and look forward to playing more.

The board play is fairly simple, build routes to be able to build different temples. but you also have a card mechanic where each player can play a card that will effect two other players. In the latter rounds, cards remain for more then one turn and they can give advantages or disadvantages. The board can use some work as it is not always very clear or easy to make out. And it can get long in the end rounds.

Very original game. It really stands apart from the crowd!

It has road building but it's not really a connections game. There's city building and development, but it's not really a civilization game. There's territory conquest, but it's very far from being a war game. There's a kind of engine building, but it's not your traditional economic game. There are also special power cards, but with a nice twist in the way they are played.  

Setting yourself up in a way that allows you to take advantage of the stuff thatt the other players build is key. Try to isolate yourself from the other players and you'll probably lose.

All things considered, it's a very interesting game but very nuanced and hard to play well. 

I like it!

Magnifique matériel, j'adore les couleurs, le style. Un beau jeu c'est important. Les mécanismes du jeu sont assez simples et permettent de se mettre dans le bain sans problème. J'aime beaucoup les tours de jeu sous forme de d'époque (calendrier). Cependant je regrette la présence importante de la carte "route sauvage". Celle-ci donne du poids à l'opportunisme au profit d'une stratégie. Ce qui est bien dommage. Alors pour un jeu plus stratégique, il est préférable de retirer les 4 cartes "route sauvage".

It's confrontational in a good way.

Artwork is amazing and the play time is about right with 4 players (2 hours).

Strategy is deep and you need to keep track of everything that other players does on the board or else, you'r going to miss scoring points opportunities and the game is kind of tight in that area.

Must have in your collection.

It is an interesting game that is based somewhat on the crayon rail games. The mechanics improve significantly on those types of games. The two most impressive aspects to the game are the sun card mechanic and the concept of sharing victory points. Though the mechanics are fairly simple, the learning curve for actual play is not. It requires several plays to develop an understanding of the methods to recover from certain set backs.

Very messy game; bad icons for the cards, the map is hard to read and interpret, and the scoring rounds are tedious. Together these also make the game too long. The sun card mechanism is in principle nice, but the actual effect for the game is not so good and often rather random.

RATING: 7.5
I only played this once so cannot really comment on replayability or how it holds up after multiple plays. I think it is a tad fiddly and I mean literally, the little road pieces and very small tokens but let's put those things aside, they do not really affect the game, albeit the gameplay. 

The game is a network (rail) building system about making sure to connect to other players' networks and keeping them away from your. The road building in itself is not that exciting and only gets more tactical once the board is crowdd enough, which does not happen until the last two turns, so a missed opportunity to make something that is necessary, fun. 

I like the sun card mechanic and this is what makes the game worth playing in my opinion, it is a bit strange that not all combinations are available but what the heck, just take it into consideration. 

The theme is okay, a good idea and reflected in all aspects, from the artwork to the card art, but it is lacking a bit of additional flavouring. 

A good game if you are into rail-games.

RATING: 4
Very repetitive. It definitely outstays it welcome by at least two hours. There is no build up of tension or any opportunity for big plays. If you manage to build point scoring structures early in the game, you'll score for them throughout. There's no opportunity for sacrifice for greater game.

Despite the clever mechanic in which an action card affects more than one player, it's really at its core a take-that game.

One interesting part about this game is in order to score a lot of points, it seems that players have to work together.

The upside:
-Felt there's an extra dose of interaction in comparison to a normal route-building game.
-Parasitic dynamics and card play both contribute in positive ways to distinct this game from other "train games".
-Mighty good looking. The new edition has so much blue *drools*

The downside:
-Undeserved screwage and game ending shenanigans surely don't make this a better game.

GORGEOUS game, with a very clever twist on placing items on the board that you can benefit from, but also everyone else and vice versa; The idea of the sun cards is very clever indeed, all in all one of Essen 2010's best. Very well balanced and a challenge with every play.

RATING: 7
This must be one of the best underrated games.  Inca Empire plays very differently than other games: 1) Players playing Sun cards are forced to either play a good on to benefit themselves and another player, or to play a nasty one to hurt two players; 2) laying roads is interesting as players are both trying to cut other players off from points as well as connect into point generators that other players have built.

Another aspect of the game is that the theme and the mechanics fit like a glove.  Players are high ranking officials in the Inca Empires trying to generate glory for Cusco, while at the same time trying to out build their fellows.  Futhermore, South American societies were very communal which comes out in play during the various game rounds.  A very good theme for a Euro game.

I feel like this game requires the sun cards to be interesting, but the sun cards themselves are overly powerful. Under the right (and essentially random) situations, a player can be granted huge run away bonuses. In our first game, two players drew pilgrimage cards that netted them 20 points each, where as I consistently drew (or was given) mountain pass abilities, which allowed me to connect to EVERYTHING on the board. Without the cards, the game is too straight forward though...

Brilliant, unique design. Fantastic board and components. Route building, a labor-point system similar to action points, and event cards played on a secondary board. Turn order may be the most valuable resource of all. Super-aggressive players will lose late, those who invest too much will never catch up -- requires perfect timing and some luck to win. Balancing mechanics make the build up to the endgame brilliant.

RATING: 6
The components in this remake are fabulous! They turn a game where a certain amount of the enjoyment was lost on eye squinting path detection, into a game that I can focus more on playing. White Goblin Games is an extremely high quality game company and they've done a stirling job with all their 2010 releases. I'm slightly in awe of the beauty of their games.

The card mechanism is clever and I like it, but the cards are rather unbalanced. Why the "Expert Surveyors" terrace card doesn't have an additional cost to build the second terrace (as the "Rapid Expansion" double conquer card does), I'll never understand. That said, there's a nice opportunity to hold back on cards to play them at opportune moments (if you have the control of going first that is). You'll want to be labour heavy and points poor at the beginning, then switch to points production after a few turns. Despite unbalanced card concerns it probably all works out in the end. I enjoy the ride.

Rules are quite simple to understand and commence playing the game within minutes.

I have some concerns with the game from the fun perspective. I'm generally not a fan of games (like Lost Valley) where players leech off the accomplishments of others. Despite the card mechanism and building theme, it boils down to who can leech off the building of others better and without being blocked by the road system. This effectively kills most of my enjoyment of the game because I enjoy the building side of it much more than the leeching side. Consequently I do not enjoy trying not to build here or there because others can connect, or trying to block their connections. I could play a mean and aggressive game, but with the theme of the game I would not enjoy it. This brings me to the point that your success in this game depends largely upon what the other players are doing around you and doing to you. Normally that would sound like a good thing, but here you can make or break another player's game if you so choose. Often even if you don't try too hard at it.

Important: Note that you can use a Wilderness card action to build a road to any point surrounding the centre starting point of the board. This makes it much easier to expand both north and south.

Also important: Play with the variant that spreads the 3 resistance/ 3 income / 0 VP region chips on the board's fist symbols. I recently played a dud game where we didn't and one player (through no fault of his own), was located right next to a 3/3/0 and 1/1/1 region chip for the first turn (perfect of the first turn's 4 income). Then he was able to follow it up with two more 3/3/0 regions for his second turn. Thus ended his need to earn income for the rest of the game and we could have called it right then, as he could just concentrate on building and connecting. To make matters worse the lead player had to hand him a couple of workers before he flew off into the lead on turn three. Needless to say, that player was not me and it seemed ludicrous that my starting position was surrounded by 3/1/4 region markers. High resistance meaning you can only conquer one in the first turn and another one in the second, bugger all income and lots of early VPs (where you don't want them).

It seems that at a certain point (when players have built their income source), the game settles down and players are making about the same number of points each turn for the last half of the game.

It's a game of balancing your phases and a few basic principles:
1. Concentrate on getting income of about 12, which should see you through.
2. Spread your road network north and south with a wilderness card (if you're lucky enough to see one).
3. Connect to everything everyone else built.
4. Build your own stuff as far away from others as possible.
5. Block routes where possible to make it harder for others.
6. Play the best card available, or set yourself up to use one later, but that can be hard if you're not going first or second. So get into the lead so you can control the card placement a little bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This could have been yet another train game of making connections and building stuff to earn victory points, set in an exotic historical background to claim some originality. Nevertheless, it is way much more than that thanks to two simple but at the same time clever mechanics. First, the catch up system in which the players in the lead have to economicly subsidize those that are behind, by giving them some coins in the income phase. Then and mainly because of the Sun Phase, in which players play cards in a grid divided in four sections, affecting positive or negatively just two of them until the next scoring phase. That way, every player has different powers and weaknesses, but everyone contribute, in some way or the other, setting them. Brilliant! Pilgramages, that at their heart are just points awarded to players that fullfil some requirements in retribution of dropping part of their building phase, are also a nice adition to the mix, as well as the Pizarro variant, that makes the moment of the end of the game uncertain, but in a way that you can prepare in advance. Nice game. Recomended.

It is hard to prevent the other players from taking advantage of your network, but that's not a problem, rather it's quite interesting. The way played cards always affect a pair of players is a nice touch, too, and also a way of balancing the game.

RATING: 7
Played once with 4P. Inca Empire is a network-building game which puts players in a quandary of competitive cooperation – clustering roads together increases the chances that buildings will be rapidly constructed in a cooperative manner, but you have to individually look out for opponents who leech off your efforts without contributing back. Alternatively, you could forge your own path and hoard those VPs to yourself, but that would be an equally arduous effort as well. 

Adding variability to the game are the Sun Event cards. Players take turns placing a card in one of four quadrants during the Sun Event phase. The effect of the card is applied to the two players whose colours border the quadrant, and it can be difficult choosing whether to make life easier for yourself (and a neighbour) or whether to sabotage opponents. This is a very intriguing, but potentially also very frustrating mechanism.

Ingrained in all of this is an element of jockeying for turn order. Players in the last position on the VP track receive benefits of extra labour and priority during the Sun Event phase, so there is actually an incentive to fall behind early on with a slight margin to take advantage of the catch-up mechanism.

A couple of nitpicks; first is that as the game progresses it becomes trickier to track concurrent effects of Sun Events as well as to trace the networks during the Sapa Inca phase. Second is that the game runs a little long, even with the Pizarro variant.

A civilization game where the focus is on the routes that you build. There are great decisions to be made in this game, mainly cost vs reward vs reward to other players (who don't have to pay the cost to share the benefits of your efforts). It's apparent now that leeching is a strong strategy in this game, connecting early to what your opponents build while using your valuable resources for other things. If leeching wasn't such an obviously strong strategy this would have been a 9 (.5 off for not having more paths to victory). The sun cards offered other fun decisions, there were occasions where I would hurt myself with sun cards to prevent leeching, and some where I would help opponents so that they would build things that aid me.

Ez volt az egyik játék, amit az esseni képek alapján ki szerettem volna próbálni. A játék kivitelezése nagyon szép. A jelölők, a kártyák mind-mind jó anyagúak, szépen kidolgozottak. Talán a térkép határok lehetnének egyértelműbbek, de a külalakra és kivitelezésre nem lehet panasz. Sajnos a játékmenetre már annál inkább.
A játék alapvetően egyszerű út- és épületépítkezés. A nyersanyag itt az ember. Az épített háromfajta épület ad győzelmi pontot. Illetve az egyes területek meghódítása. Annyi csavar van csak ebben, hogy építéskor és egy-egy uralkodóváltáskor is van pontosztás. A körök végén, az épületekhez vezetett saját utak alapján. A körök vezetők uralkodására vannak osztva, amelyek elején a meghódított területek nagysága alapján kapunk "embernyersanyagot". Egyedüli újdonság számomra a játékban a különböző bónuszkártyák felhasználási módja volt. Ugyanis egy kártyát nem csak magunkra vagy más játékosra játszunk ki, hanem mindig két játékosra. De sajnos ez a két játékos mindig ugyanaz négy játékos esetében. Pontosabban mindig ugyanazokra a párokra lehet kijátszani a lapokat, amik persze lehetnek pozitív vagy negatív hatásúak. Három játékosnál ez sokkal jobban működik szerintem. A játékban sajnos úgy tűnik, aki lemarad az nem tud már mit tenni és ez már a játék 1/3-ánál előjött nálunk. Ez nagyon megbélyegezte az amúgy sem túl erős játékmenetet. Ezen kívül a lapok közt volt olyan, ami szinte alig hatott a játékmenetre, de volt olyan is, ami órási mértékben befolyásolta.
Sajnos azt kell mondanom az utóbbi idők legnagyobb csalódása volt számomra ez a játék. A kártyakijátszáson kívül nekem semmi újat nem adott, emiatt sem értékelném magasra, de a játékmenettel is sok gondunk adódott. Egyedül a kivitelezés érdemel pozitív szavakat.

[Z-man games 2010 edition] {Inca, civilization; variable-phase, resource management, conquer; optimal 4p}  Inca Empire is a solid game, with interesting decision.  However, being the leader in Inca Empire is very unfavorable in Inca Empire.

The Sun Phase is interesting, as you have to decide whether to help yourself (and on opponent) or hurt the other two opponents.

The People Phase is tricky, esp. a player have to balance the road system expansion and construction well.  Early game options and late game options are really different.

I prefer the Pizarro's Arrival variant, which makes the game less decisive in the last era.

Luck is stronger than I expected - in terms of culture markers allocation and event card draw.  Some event cards are powerful than others, esp. when one draws it at the proper timing.

The game components are effective, although the road pieces should be longer.  Why there are no 5-labour tokens?

At its core, this is a route building game (not only to further your own goals, but to poach on other players' builds). 

I really had trouble with the myriad of Sun card, and was constantly looking them up; hopefully more experience will make them more intuitive. Besides that, the Wilderness Road rules were confusing too.

An interesting balance of competition and cooperation, mechanically the game is not complex but some AP can result when performing Construction or Road builds.

I'll be getting a copy, hard to believe this game has flown under my radar for 5 years...

Excellent route-building game. Distinctive event-card element to help or hinder pairs of players. Great artwork & production values.

I'd like to try the variant for a shorter game to see how this affects the experience.

Did not like the micromanaging and number crunching aspect of the game. Was pretty tedious and felt more like work than like a game. There were some interesting aspects to it, and I could see my rating going up a LITTLE bit with more plays.

A simple enough Euro route laying game.

It didn't seem hard enough to prevent others connecting to everything in the one game I played (though the other 2 players both said the game was different to the other games of it they'd played as it was much more concentrated in the centre).

Inca Empire is a fairly complex empire expansion game.  It is beautiful as the board fills up with roads as players expand as quickly as they can north and south to the furthest reaches of the board, and build cities and temples.  It has a bit of a race like feel to it, as the Inca map is tall and narrow with a lot of choke points.

I liked a lot of what's going on in Inca Empire. Player's have a lot of choices, the turn-based action system works well and the mechanic for placing good/bad event cards is brilliant. What's not as brilliant in a game that seems to last much longer than the advertised 1.5 hours is the random draw of cards that are wildly unbalanced in terms of power and usefulness. Much of the game is deterministic and has little or no luck involved. But the cards really dictate who will win. Draw the cards that give you extra actions or points for doing nothing at the end of the game, and you will win. Fail to draw these cards, and you will lose. Given that the game already is long and involved, and is not otherwise luck-driven, an auction mechanic for drafting the cards might have mitigated how unbalanced they are. This is definitely worth a try and got some things right, but the luck factor relating to the event cards coupled with the fact that the end game inevitably devolves into a bash-the-leader affair, will keep me from acquiring or even playing this much.

Played twice with the same set of 3 players. Very nice components. Interesting game play. Wilderness Sun cards are way too valuable and are a total game changer. With 3 players, there may be too much 2 vs. 1 and if a player is more often on the "1" side, he will likely not win the game. The end game is a little blah as players end up trying to connect to existing cities, temples, etc. Would like to try it with 4 players as the 2 vs. 1 dynamic is removed.

Unusual mechanics make this game a must have. Not because of the novelty but because it works so well. One of the best games to come out in 2010. It is challenging and competitive but requires you to constantly pay attention to others. Leeching off of other players is a constant requirement in this game. Love it!!!!

Inca empire has a nice self-balancing mechanism that helps to prevent run-away leaders. It also has an interesting mechanic where you want to try to build paths into your opponents buildings to score points for them.

I liked my first play a lot more than I expected from reading the rules.  I definitely didn't get the way this works until seeing the game play out on the board.  Both the sun card play and the network building aspects force players into temporary reluctant alliances.  My concerns, which hopefully are addressed in future plays, are mainly around the potential for this to turn too much into an El Grande-esque bash the leader fest.

Update.  Well, unlikely to play again because it's out of my collection. Not compelling enough to keep around or play again.

Great Components. Amazing art.
The game has simple rules and excellent interaction between the players. It is a civilization type of game that lasts 2 hours (make it 3 if it is your first time). It is a very fulfilling game that I highly recommend to anyone that likes games like Advanced Civilization, Azteca, Dune, etc. It is not similar to any of the previous games, it has its own unique character, and has a wicked mechanism of event cards that balances and makes this game so exciting. Enough said, proceed to get your copy now!
I have also its predecessor, Tahuantinsuyu. I am glad that I got the new version. The improvement in components is ten fold. The game is still the same. The rulebook has been streamlined and flows nicely.

Inca Empire is a little bit of an unusual game. At first glance it's primarily a route building game. But really it's a card game?

In the game, there are a series of rounds. In earlier rounds you start with more workers, but have fewer "sun" phases and "people" phases. As the game goes on, you start with fewer workers and have more and more of sun and people phases. In the last round, the end is randomly determined so the number of sun/people phases is variable and unknown.

Each round, you'll first get the provided workers for the round and then take your conquered tribe workers. Then you'll have at least one sun phase where you play cards to help/hinder players and one people phase when you build roads and structures. Most rounds you'll have more than one, getting more and more as the game goes along. At the end of a round there'll be a scoring phase where you get points for being connected to structures.

In the sun phase you play one of your three cards. The card board is divided into several sections with each section bordering two players. In turn order, you place a card face down into a section, but each section can only be played into by one player in a sun phase. Then cards are revealed and the effects, positive and negative, are made known. This phase seems to really be the heart of the game. (More on this later).

During the people phase you build two roads and do a single build/conquer action. Roads must be built along a path marked on the board. They must touch a conquered region, even if they extend into an unconquered area. A path can only, normally, hold one player's road. Roads must be connected back to your start location (and if they are destroyed you must rebuild them before you can extend the isolated section), but they can branch in multiple directions. Building roadscan be done before or after your build/conquer action. Additionally, there is a building action that lets you build another road if you want/need to.

Each different building costs some amount of labor, scores you some immediate points, and then scores at the end of the round for all the players who are connected to that structure. Buildings which score more points generally cost more labor.

Instead of building you can conquer a native tribe. There are no distance or adjacency rules to this. Different tribes have different strengths 1-3, provide different amounts of labor 1-3, and provide different amount of points 0-4.

The cards and cardplay in this game are really the essence of this game. Cards either make things easier, harder, worth more points or break some of the rules... most notably allowing you to build impossible routes crossing areas where there are no paths or paralleling an existing opponent's road. The card play mechanism is clever in that you must play a card that affects two players. Because each spot can only be played in once a sun phase, turn order is huge. Playing late in turn order means who you'll splash is out of your control, you're forced to put a card in whatever spot is left, your only choice is which of your three cards you can put in that spot. Because a round can have multiple sun and people phases, cards played early in the round will still be present in subsequent sun/people phases, only clearing at round end. So a potent advantage (or disadvantage) played early in a round with many sun/people phases is potent.

The route building aspect of this game seems fairly straightforward. You want to be connected to as many things as possible (but you might want to hang back pointwise for a bit as turn order is reverse point order). The main real challenge to the route building aspect of the game ended up being the cards. Getting or losing extra road building actions and being able to build "wilderness" roads (the rule breaking roads) is huge. The normal problems of route building could be easily corrected if you had the right sun phase bonus cards in play. Or alternatively if you lost the ability to build roads, or if your roads got destroyed (which admittedly is partially in your control depending on how you build/conquer) that could put a huge dent in your route building efforts.

And that felt a bit odd. The game feels like it's mostly about route building, but that aspect of the game was mostly governed by the card play. That was a bit of a disconnect for me. All the players in our game ended up being connected to everything by the end of the game... the challenge wasn't so much building routes, it was getting extra road building actions and especially wilderness roads when you needed them.

I generally liked the game. But it did feel like most of the game was being decided by the sun phases. There's a lot of time and actions spent outside of the sun phases, which led to an odd disparity where the bulk of time and effort in the game wasn't as important as the brief moments where we decided the sun phase. I also wonder if perhaps there's a Coloretto/Zooloretto thing going on here, where you could shed the surrounding game and simplify it to the core mechanism and have a much quicker simpler game that's just as good, if not better.

Not at all impressed with this game. At least as a 3 players game. The decisions are OK, but if you end up alone in a part of the board, and the other 2 player are together, well, tough for you.

RATING: 7
This is a route-building game where you're racing to reach and build at specific sites on a long, awkwardly oriented map of the Peru/Chile area. You also have to subdue regions to get income to build, and you get points for having your road network connected to everything you or others have built.

There's also some card play: perks or disadvantages that players must apply to a pair of adjacent players (maybe including themselves). This adds randomness and replayability to the game. It also adds the appearance of take-that, but it's more interesting than usual due to the decision of which two players a card will apply to.

I tried to play the short game, but unless I just played terribly, this doesn't seem balanced quite right as the free income (money the games basically subsidizes you with, gradually withdrawn as you hopefully build your own income base) drops off too quickly. I felt there ended up being too many turns at the end of the game where a player was broke and basically had to pass their turn.

Also, I'm not convinced the game has enough tension from the possibility of being blocked. It seems like you get "wilderness road" cards (which let you e.g. build a connection that is already taken by someone else) often enough that you can't easily block somebody's path somewhere. In my first game a couple of players nearly ran a circle around Cuzco (the starting area), hooking up to everything of value. (I admit it would be hard to get the "blockyness" just right, since if it's too easy to block, certain player positions could be at a disadvantage.)

It plays rather smoothly without an excessive number of rules and procedures. It was fun to figure out the best thing to do on a turn, but it was a bit tactical.

[u]1st play Feb 2013[/u] 
Difficult to evaluate in my first play, could go up if play is more against each other than iterated point grabs. I couldn't tell if the Wilderness Trails made strategy irrelevant. Difficult to judge also as my first play included the expansion (Earthquakes & Fighting Gods) as well as a highly disengaged 4th chair and being pressured to play a certain way by the 3rd chair. Overall, this play excited me, the incentives may prove very interesting to manipulate and along these lines the card play mechanic is sweet. I would gladly play again and be very open to re-evaluting it with prejudice. For now, it drops here.

Utterly gorgeous board.

In INCA EMPIRE the players are "Apus" (leader of one of the four regions/suyus). Your job as an Apu is to increase your status in the eyes of the divine emperor ("Sapa Inca") by doing the best job of expanding and improving the empire. Each Apu begins with the manpower of their region of the original empire. They build roads and conquer neighboring regions, increasing the manpower and resources available to them. Apus are awarded for each new region they add to the empire and for improvements such as terraces, garrisons, cities and temples.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting network connection game with an original mechanic for playing bonus and penalty cards. The cards always affect two players, so you have to consider very carefully when and where to bring them into play. Playing time is considerable with four, but the game is exciting until the end. Biggest drawback of the game is the rulebook, which is pretty convoluted (and made us play at least two minor rules wrong on our first play).

There's something very cool about this game that scratches the Age of Steam itch.  The part about building routes in such a way as to help yourself while hindering other players is certainly a part of it, but connecting to the regions that will give you points is another part.  That players can build into other players' networks to leech points off of the work that they've done means that there's a passive-aggressive element to the game, which is similar to Age of Steam, but not nearly the same in terms of actually playing the game.  It's seems to be a clever design in this way, and I really like that part of it.

I have mixed feelings about the cards.  On the one hand, they're rule-changing elements in the game, which is never a favorite characteristic for me, and the fact that they're random makes it even more frustrating.  Still, you get to see the cards before you make your definite plans, so you can still adapt to the cards that are played against you.  You may not get to do exactly what you wanted to do, but at least it doesn't prevent you from doing anything.  They also add to the replayability of the game (without them, the game would become static and scripted), and are such a part of the game that it would be hard to imagine playing the game without them.

A remake of Tahatsinwhatchamacallit, only with nicer components that don't require drawing on with crayons.  For me that's a plus.  Some folks prefer the text on the cards of the original game but I think the graphics work fine once you're used to them.  A player aid would be nice though.

It works, it flows well, but for a too long time.
I strongly suggest to shorten your game.

It is a moderately simple connection game, there is a fuzzy spread of similar yet different strategies to win but if u make the mistake of isolate yourself and go alone exploring, you are dead (as I did).
Some cards are very powerful and i liked the original way in which they are played on 2 of the 4 players:loads of bad tricks to play there.

As a pseudo-rail game, I was expecting something heavier and more strategic.

Inca Empire, for me, has a greater-than-acceptable amount of luck at every step in the game: starting position, conquest chits, card benefits/sabotage, etc.  Also, certain cards (Wilderness Road, Rural Unrest) are overpowered to the point of being game breaking.

To drive the final nail into the "I'll never play this again" coffin, I find it annoying that, as a catch-up mechanism, the first place player is forced to give up labor tokens to the last place player - even if the leader is only a point or two ahead of the person in second place.  I'm not sure how that is meant to be fair, exactly, but it certainly played a pivotal role in me losing a game to the player who should have been the runner-up.

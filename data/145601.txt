Rating August 2017: 5.5 (Case 3 makes more logical sense, but is a little boring and repetitive.)  Placing up for Trade / Sale

Will always play the Grizzled over this. Better gameplay without a semi-okay to boring story to pause and listen to.

RATING: 5.8
After having played only the first scenario: interesting coop card game with a hint(and extra motivation) of a detective story unfolding. While interesting, the final scoring is a bit fuzzy (Hanabi-ish, which is a bit off since the game is not abstract at all, like Hanabi). Nevertheless, an interesting plot unfolding, worth at least checking the rest of the scenarios. If you don’t own it and want a detective/thinky/scenario driven game, better go for Scerlock Holmes or Mythos Tales instead for the same price.

A weird hybrid co-op game. Takes the storytelling framework of games like Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective, and somehow makes the game mechanically more interesting while simultaneously making the narrative far more dull. I'm not sure how the "symbol-matching" mechanics will hold up over time, as it didn't seem obvious to me how to play in a more efficient or informed way: turns often seemed to be guided by blind luck. I still like the game. We'll see how much I want to play it going forward.

Awesome job with the art and graphic design by WizKids, which is a pretty rare feat for them.

RATING: 6.2
Interesting attempt to modernize Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective. I think it adds a little too much and feels a bit disjointed as you swap between a mini-game of hand management/card placement, and narrative slices. 

It is indeed fun, but it fails to really achieve a sense of excellent for me.

Two games in and the arrow is pointing up for this game. The card play is more interesting than I expected, and after losing badly at the second Easy case, I’m excited for the challenge of the Normal and Hard ones.

You play cards to the table to create a chain of required symbols. If you get all the required symbols, you get to flip over the clue and read it. The idea here is to read as many clues as possible so as to correctly answer the case questions at the end of the game. Once you can’t play a card to the current symbol chain, you have to drop out. When you drop out, if you have a Plot Twist (negative effect) card in your hand, you have to play it, so you want to avoid dropping out at all costs.

While it’s hard to plan since you can't discuss the exact nature of the cards you hold, you can play cards that just tread water (don't add or remove any symbols) which then leads to opening up an opportunity for someone else to play. Or to flip a hot tip over to its active side. Two or more hot tips confers a bonus action such as draw a card and is a way to keep from having to drop out of the round.

So I found more angles here than I expected there to be, and the cases seem to require leaps of deductive logic that have already proven challenging. I would caution, however, that 2P-3P is the sweet spot for the game. Playing with four felt unsatisfying because you have a hand of three cards instead of four or six and the choices felt too limited. Playing with a hand of four was much more fun

The combination of the game puzzle to secure the clues, and figuring out the mystery is very cool.  The "easy" cases were not as enjoyable because the solution is too obvious, but the normal cases have been better in that regard. I will say, it takes us almost 2 hours to play a case, and we are not slow players. The time on the box of 60 minutes is not accurate.

This is probably an insta-buy for me. It seems similar to the escape the room style games but in detective film noir(?) style. Old gangsters style. Fully cooperative of course. This game does have the "vague communication" mechanic.

RATING: 7
Nicely designed, and meets the goals set out in A. B. West's "Director's Cut" commentary (aka designer diary). Played with 2 and suspect it's better with 2 than with higher player counts. The simplicity of the clue mechanism is just right so as not to overwhelm the flow of the mystery portion of the game, though I do wish that it relied less on consensual rules for limiting player conversation.

(Update) After playing Case #2, we were disappointed with the solution. The game still plays nicely, so this is more of a content issue than a game issue, and perhaps others wouldn't have the same experience. But I've lowered my rating a bit for now. Will adjust if justified after Case #3.

RATING: 4
For me this was a disconnect between the mechanics. Each of them was good on it's own, but together they felt odd. On one hand you had the story, crime solving and detective stuff. On the other there was a matching card game.
If you didn't perform the matching, your were punished, so there was no idea of trying to solve the "most likely" clue unless you had cards that worked.

For me this game is like a lesser version of The Grizzled.

Fan of mystery-themed games and this one sounds like it's brimming with atmosphere as well as some sound mechanics (cooperative cardplay and symbol-matching, aka The Lost Expedition).

RATING: 5.5
Sort of like two games in one, Strange combination of "silent" card-play and story based deduction. The "mini-games" of acquiring clues feel disconnected from the story part. It's an interesting attempt at making a deduction game like Sherlock Holmes Consulting detective with more game in it.
Unfortunately the game outstays its welcome. The card play mechanism used when acquiring clues isn't interesting enough to keep it from being repetitive. You mostly just play one of the few cards that work when it's your turn, hoping that will work for other players as well. The game lacks a way of deducing what is good for other players.
Play Kreus, Hanabi or The Grizzled if you want "silent" card play with deduction.
Play Sherlock Holmes Consulting detective if you want the detective deduction aspect.

Deadline is a fun game. The content is not offensive to families. The core gameplay, co-operative set collection, works well with players of all ages. We have enjoyed our play throughs and look forward to working our way through all 12 cases.

RATING: 7
A unique game that puts players in the shoes of a noir private eye, attempting to win clues each round to piece together one of 12 cases. Offers Shadowrun: Crossfire-like quick playing symbol-matching cardplay in service to Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective-like deduction, all wrapped up in a bottle of bourbon and a haze of cigarette smoke. Although wired for co-op, the Official Solo Variant with a couple of tweaks makes this a fun little oddity with just enough P.I. flavor and a charmingly simple ruleset I can play on those evenings I want to puzzle out a mystery and play some cards by myself.

What a fantastic little game. My wife loves it and i think the design is amazing.
The card play is like Onirim meets Elder Sign meets the grizzled. The stories are really well thought out and the flavour text is incredible.

What Makes this game even greater is the designers have come up with solo rules that i am really enjoying.  would recommend to anyone that likes simple games that take a lot of thought and enjoy solving mysteries.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Feels a lot like the designer was trying to take Consulting Detective and build more of a game around it. The result is enjoyable, but there are some pretty significant flaws. More than anything else, this game is very abstract for what it is. This is partially because of the card play overshadowing the flavour text, but I also feel like this game spoon feeds you the answers to the cases, so there's not really any reading between the lines. It felt like I was more interested in matching symbols with the card play than noting the details of the case. The writing also didn't feel very period to me, but it was fine.

As for the card game portion, I felt like some things were a little underdeveloped. The hot leads and plot twist cards seemed to just happen too fast, and very little could be done to get rid of plot twists or to refresh hot leads. Even investigator powers felt very limited, as you became a faceless investigator as soon as you used your ability.

Overall I enjoyed this game. Solving mysteries is fun, and the card overlapping here was a fun mechanism to experience. I just don't think this game can be taken any more seriously than just a simple little card game where you may or may not figure the case out.

Seems more thematic than Beyond Baker Street and more accessible than Ace Detective, though unsure about the 'patching' card play as a barrier to accessing clue cards as it may frustrate, whereas Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective avoids such bluster by leaving it up to you without randomised restrictions.

However, knowing it is soloable plus I can replay again with others makes this more appealing then Arkham Horror for story telling.

A light deduction game, where for every clue you wish to collect you have to match the required location symbols with the symbols on the cards in your hand, thats both fun and challenging, but there isn't much deduction in the game, and the case and flavour text on the cards doesn't really  shine through.

I really wanted to like this game as I love narrative based games like SHCD or the new Legacy of Dragonholt. However, there is a big disconnect of the game and narrative experience. Granted, I have only played this solo, but it is like playing Consulting Detective and Go Fish at the same time, but when you make a set you get to read a paragraph from the case book. It looks great, but after two hours on one case all the flavor text on the cards "vanished" and all I really cared about were the symbols at the bottom. In fact, if you try to make a story from the clues you are following from the event cards that you play, it starts to make even less sense (wait, why am I going to a hotel to talk with someone when I was told they are at the dinner and I am trying to go there?). The final question part is kind of a joke as all the cards you discovered are sitting right there and all one has to do is a close reading and everything is right there spelled out. If the answer is not there, it is probably because you had to discard a clue due to the random nature of what event cards were drawn and never got to finish that lead. Overall, a very bland interpretation of what should have been an exciting mystery. I should have known something was off when the player count is 2-4 in a predetermined narrative based game, whereas other games in this genera all support one player.

I really enjoyed this game. We played it wrong the first time. Oops. Our first games are often full of "take-backs," "do-overs," and "Are you sure you read those rules right?" Unfortunately it kept us from solving the case. I'm really looking forward to trying case #2 now that we have things straightened out. I think I would enjoy it even more if the table talk wasn't quite so limited, but that's an easy house rule to make. I am very excited to play again. Thanks for the game, Adam. We're hoping an expansion is in the works.

I'm a huge Noir fan, and bought this for theme alone.  The game play is pretty simple but enjoyable from a cooperative puzzle standpoint.  The card text is rich in theme, but you have to try really hard to bring it into the game since you are really only focused on the symbols they provide.  I've only played one of the twelve cases so far, and will definitely play through the other cases.

I wanted a cooperative game that is easy to teach, can be played in shorter time and I'm really happy with this game. While I can play Consulting Detective or Mythos Tales with some players I missed something easier to swallow for my more casual groups or when I'm more limited by time. Deadline is great! Cardplay for solving cases is fun story is simple but interesting and while you know the case afterwards you can easily play with different players or with the same group again to achieve a better result. Highly recommended!

Interesting, but it took way longer than the one hour which was written on the box. We drew a lot of bad luck cards and thus it dragged on and on. Maybe we did something wrong...

Bonus point for fantastic art direction! Obligatory Philip Marlow voice when reading flavor text.

RATING: 7
Lots of similarities to The Grizzled, but less outwardly brutal. In The Grizzled, even from the beginning you can almost sense the helplessness of the journey ahead of you. Deadline uses the same sort of cards-in-a-line matching, but changes it up a bit. "Solving" the cards that you lay out before you feels very thematic as you're trying to get leads out of people. We played a "3" difficulty game and had to line things up just right towards the end to be successful. Once you're done, you base how well you did upon how many questions you're able to answer. I like the story telling aspect and overall gameplay. Nice game!

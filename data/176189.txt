Zombicide: BP seems to have fixed a lot of the issues I had with vanilla Zombicide. The reason for the lower score, however, has to do with the scenarios needing the player count listed - and not being able to easily play with lower counts. At this pace, Zombicide will have their issues worked out into an 8 or 9 grade game (per my scale) by their 10th iteration. I'm sure they'll get there. For now, I may keep this version, as the theme is up my alley, and the minis are amazing. But then again, I'll probably piece this out, as I have Myth and Last Night On Earth, and this overlaps both too much.

RATING: 6
Light hack-and-slash fare. With all the KS stuff it's good fun chucking hordes of zombie minis on the board and being able to clear swathes of them out with powerful attacks. There's not a whole lot else going on though, and missions are pretty long. Decent fun in moderation. An extra 0.5 for the stellar production.

Great improvement over previous versions of Zombicide.  It's a more challenging edition as there are no longer Zombivors.  Plus you can lose due to the Necromancers creating too many spawn zones.  Fiddly rules such as friendly fire have been refined and now make sense.  Zombie spawn and movement is more unpredictable with the addition of double spawn cards.  Players can now manipulate the placement of spawn zones by destroying Necromancers.  The game can still run long due to the never ending horde but generally a more tense, challenging and enjoyable experience.  Quite happy to have added it to my collection.

我比較喜歡現代背景的喪屍末日，而非中古世紀的喪屍背景，黑死病的複雜度沒有S2高，地圖僅是一般的地下城，沒有機關或不同地形地貌，S2至少有牢門、旋轉門、瞭望台、鐵絲網、汽車..好幾種機關可以規劃下一步策略。不過黑死病有將不少前代的缺點改良，尤其角色卡牌大加分。這次玩風大的黑死病KS全擴，相當驚人，若有愛一定要買KS版。

Fun to play.  Watch with glee as the unmanageable late-game zombie horde approaches you & your friends.  In my opinion an improvement over the modern-set previous games.  Simple game-play & dice rolling mechanics that newcomers can learn easily, especially when playing with experienced players.

I would consider set-up moderate (laying out tiles, sorting tokens for your chosen scenario).

Warning to Completionists: Game comes with 71 highly detailed minis that cry out to be painted. (Can you hear them?  I...I can hear them.)

I didn't play any Zombicide before Black Plague, I even dislike them mainly because the components. The tiles didn't appeal to me and the minis were meh... Then a friend of mine gently introduced me to black plague... I like the medieval themes, the color of the survivors were much better and the zombies were amazingly crafted. I felt in love with all the plastic... then I played it... I hated myself for not giving Zombicide a chance. Its incredible! I loved everything from it! 
Now I don't know if I should have the other five boxes (Season 1, 2, 3 and both expansions from the "modern themed" Zombicide.

RATING: 3.5
I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I wasn't a fan of the original Zombicide, so at first I didn't even take a look at this game. Then I've heard that Black Plague supposedly fixed a lot of the issues I had with the first version. So I wanted to give it a try... and after playing it a few times, I must say that, even if this version is clearly better, I still don't like this game at all!

On the plus side, I like that they got rid of some stupid rules (like the order of shooting). I like even better some of the new ideas that Black Plague introduces, like the medieval theme, the magic or the epic items. Yet now that my mind is not focusing on the hideous rules of the original game, I realized even more aspects that I don't like about Zombicide.

For one thing this game is really long... and that wouldn't actually be a problem if the game-play would offer interesting choices, many possibilities, things to do and to explore. Instead the whole thing is completely scripted: open a door, search stuff to gear up, go out, kill zombies, complete the objective. That's it! Now that last thing might be different, depending on the scenario, but the first 4 will be exactly the same EVERY SINGLE TIME. But that doesn't matter, because the zombie killing part is where the fun of this game is, right? Wrong!

I know that this is probably the selling point for many players, but I just can't stand the fact that the only thing you do in this game is rolling dice! I like dice a lot when they are implemented as a clever mechanism to spice things up or add some thrill to the experience... I hate it instead when designers think that dice-rolling can replace actual solid mechanisms. They don't! It's not fun when all you do in a 2-3 hours game is rolling plastic cubes. It just becomes unbearably monotonous... especially when the zombies never feel like an interesting enemy. They just sit there waiting to be slaughtered by an avalanche of dice.

I also have some minor issues, but at this point I believe I've said enough. Bottom line, Zombicide is just not a game for me, no matter what edition. I don't like Ameritrash games enough to enjoy this game. Therefore take what I've said with a grain of salt, if you're someone that lays at the other end of the spectrum. As far as I'm concerned though... this game is just bad! Bad, bad, bad, bad!

Vast improvement on the original. This one wears its Kickstarter cash-grab badge on its sleeve; "Here are some sexy miniatures! And I guess some rules if you must".

But to be honest it's just good fun. After four editions it hasn't changed much, but just enough to feel competent. Chuck some dice, mow down some zombies. Ameritrash doing what it does well.

Played the tutorial as solo, then played as a 2player co-op. I loved how easy it was to explain the game enough to cover the tutorial. The idea that I then talk about abominations and necros as they come up in future games helps to reduce the amount of rules overhead before the first game.  The player boards are frankly the most important component in the game. Simple standee's or tiles for characters or zombies would not really knock this game down but taking those player consoles would severely hurt this game. They are in however and the game flows really well for it.

No he jugado a las versiones anteriores. Lo compré por las miniaturas y la caja por dentro está muy bien organizada, el material es de muy buena calidad. 

Le eché un vistazo a las reglas y parecía muy simple. Venía de jugar a "Star wars: imperial assault" y me daba miedo qué me iba a encontrar. La experiencia fue positiva porque la Aventura "crece" rapidamente. Hay que medir la subida de experiencia por parte de todos porque añade dificultad al juego, que tiene una importante dosis de azar.

Es ligero y rejugable (al menos un par de veces cada aventura) porque es un juego vivo, muy poco estático. Lo más rolero que tiene es "buscar armas", así que es válido para toda la familia.

Jugadores: Recomiendo 4+.

RATING: 6.8
I just play one scenario and we were overwhelmed by the Zombies. I should play more to see if there is tactics or strategy in this game except trowing dices for everything. I like the mood and the fantasy style. I like also throwing dices, but they are so few in the pool and some time quite ineffective, that I cannot enjoy really the action. The characters grow triggering a rise in difficulty much higher than their improvements. The object deck is too big and give back a little bit frustration waiting for the needed object to complete the scenario. Only two crypt items for a game of 99€ ... come on?!?

Zombicide just as you know and cherish it - now for Fantasy lovers! There are only few alterations as the rules go and everything has been brilliantly transported into a mediaeval Scenario. Not that I did not thoroughly enjoy the "other" Zombicide, but as someone who is into the Fantasy and High Adventure Genres you certainly feel even happier playing this version. The types of heroes, the weaponry, the designs, the old style slaying - aaah, there's nothing quite like it.

I (try to) gather with a group of friends to play a boardgame every month. The most games we only play once or twice and then try the next one, but I've already played Zombicide BP 5 times in three months. We really like it.

+ Beautiful & many miniatures.
+ Nice components with clear functions.
+ Plastic player dashboards to hold the cards in place.
+ Balanced gameplay (not too hard but hard enough).
+ Clear rulebook & basic rules.
+ Freedom to choose your own gameplay and style.
+ Unique characters that grow noticeable stronger during the game.
+ Can be played solo.
- Some specific rules/situations can lead to discussion concerning the rules.

Really worth the money. Can't wait to receive the remaining Kickstarter components (expected June 2016).

Not very interesting game for me, as it always seems to follow the same structure:
Search, search, search until you find and OP item.
Always open all the doors meanwhile you are on blue level, so you can avoid later surprises.
If you fulfill what said, its a piece of cake.
Its very random, as an early abomination and bad draws of cards can make it a inferno

Held off on Zombicide because I didn't like the price of entry and some of the rules seemed iffy, but Black Plague is a great game with its mix of dungeon crawl feel and zombie invasion/repulsion missions. Mechanics are tight, and this can get tough quick, so you've always gotta make smart choices with your Actions, balancing out the use of ranged attacks, Searching buildings and spreading out damage over your Survivors. The components are awesome, from the artwork and killer mini sculpts to those player boards and the pegs to keep track of your stats and health.

I admit I considered getting in on the Zombicide Season 3 kickstarter as it had a lot of great content. But... I couldn't get past the priority rule, when using a ranged weapon on a space with another survivor. But this edition fixes it (well the fix will most likely also work for the other editions) however I like the fantasy theme a little more than the "ordinary" metropolitan Zombicide theme.

Now just hoping for some GoT-survivors and maybe a Conan the barbarian spoof.

Got Hunter pledge from one of BGG user that was by mistake marked as a Knight pledge. Seller offered refund but once I played I was in.

Great game if run by a game master that control not only zombies but also setting his own rules depending on players luck or choices. 
Kept 3 kids from 3 to 7 years old and 3 adults for full 3 missions and never got bored. They actually didn't want to stop and was late night.

Boards are amazing. Cartoony style with a lot of detail and clear to read elements. Dashboards are fantastic keeping your table tidy.

Miniatures could be a little bit better casted but survived a lot in hands of the children.

Cant wait for Green Horde and another session.

A simple and intuitive rule set supports fun and easy play for this versatile zombie romp with a fantasy theme. If you like miniatures, there are plenty to add onto this game, and every aspect of the design has been thought out carefully, including the components, the only drawback being a rather unwieldy number of zombies occupying the board later in the game.  Much like the D&D Adventure series, it's simple and fun to create your own adventures with this game, and every added expansion just broadens your options. It would even be easy to bring in enemies from other games, giving them little tweaks to their behavior, HP, or damage. I'd like to see more variety in the tiles (at least visually), but perhaps this will come in time. This is the zombie game for fantasy fans who don't usually play zombie games!

It's a fun bash and crash dungeon crawler. It's an expensive dungeon crawler, but it has a ton of minis and the scenarios are a ton of fun. It's just a fun way to kill some zombies, but it doesn't involve a ton of thought or strategy.

Plays similar to it's predecessors with a few improvements... can feel a bit like a grind still at times but that is somewhat par for the course with any game that has somewhat of a dungeon crawl-esque feel to it... always searching for better gear. 
Friendly fire isn't nearly the same issue it used to be & it feels like you can get more done in a turn than the older installments in this series. I enjoy this game when I'm in the mood for a good co-op fantasy grind session. 
Kickstarter: Knight Pledge! Solid fun and much improved over it's predecessors in my opinion.

RATING: 3
The Zombicide system got old for me. The designers reduced the tension in Black Plague. It is much easier now. You do not get permanent wounds, do not drop equipment when hit by zombies and the friendly fire rule is tweaked. But not for the better. 

Black Plague is a Zombicide softcore experience now. The Quests are repetitive, the overall design is almost the same.

I love Zcide when it came out - but now I am done with it.

Update: Wave 2.0 did not change that at all. It seems that the designers do not have any new idea to present. It is just the same old Zombicide experience. It lacks tactical depth, it lacks tenson and can end with a card draw. It was a great time with this series but with Black Plague - I say goodbye!

Zombicide version 1 was better.  This series is beginning to become rather tiring and repetitive and it feels as though they have deliberately made the game easier to bring younger players in which sadly completely ruins the challenge and feels like a cakewalk.

The game is to repetitive, place some zombies, kill some zombies, place more zombies, and kill more zombies, gain a level and more zombies will come.  Adding to the repetitive factor is the luck and randomness making planning and strategy very limited.  Adding to these there is the very high price, granted that there are very nice models but for that price you can buy other very good board games, and still have money to buy models from some other good miniature company.

Surprised by how much we like this game.  The first few times I played I would've given it a 7.  But once we got the rules down, and didn't have to consult the book every few minutes, it comes to the table quite a bit and is really fun.  Who knew that killing zombies could be so satisfying?  Really want a Legacy edition, although it looks like Massive Darkness may be creating exactly that!

Wore this out within 2-3 months - but got a ton of plays.

KS Backer, first time playing a Zombicide game.  My wife was reluctant at first to bring this game to the table because it seemed intimidating. One game in though and we were hooked. The minis are beautiful, the rules are simple, the gameplay is fun with a lot of potential for strategy.  The feeling of having a ton of zombie models on the board chasing after your plucky group of survivors never gets old.  10/10!

RATING: 10
Early days and this might get old quick, but currently like it ... alot.

Yes there's lots of luck, yes it's very light - but it's fun. I like the co-op nature (no 1 vs many here), and the improvements over Zombicide are pretty significant. Range attacks now make sense, you can use range attacks into zones with survivors and have some chance of taking out zombies (unlike the original, where you had to hit friendlies). The vaults mean you can move around the map fairly easily and not just get cornered and know you're dead (depends on the scenario of course).

Just need more variety in heroes (of course I didn't kickstart) you have 6, you play with all 6, every game ...

If I want a co-op survival/scenario type game with lots of thought and control I'll go for GloomHaven. Zombicide BP is a pleasing distraction, not much brain power required :)

** Update, hmm maybe I'm a bit obsessed with this game - it's simple, I like that, it's coop, I like that, it's very solo-able, like that. Plus it's a sandbox, you can tweak this as you like, only thing missing is a campaign - but there are fan produced ones :) Maybe Massive Darkness will eclipse this when it arrives, but for now it's my flavour of the month (and I'm spending all my free time painting the minis; Fatties, Runners and Walkers from BP done, Deadeye Walkers 90% done, 2 characters done).

House Rules: Abominations have hit points (based on threat level) weapons do -1 damage to them. Necromancers are their own spawn points, Cabal only in same zone. Crossbows all need a reload.

Good Co-op.  Lots of pressure to level your characters and move things forward without spending too long trying to balance out kills.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is the only Zombicide game I've played and I am pretty impressed.  However, I also have a sweet spot for medieval themed dungeon crawl games so I might be a little biased.  Based on the scenario you pick, the game can vary from easy to very hard.  Most of the quests that come with the base game feel similar - rearrange map tiles, randomize objective tokens, place vault weapons in the vaults (only 2 come in the base game which is a bummer).  Boxes like Murder of Crows, Deadeye Walkers, and Zombie Bosses make the game even more fun and challenging.  The Wulfsburg expansion adds more elements like magical items, zombie wolfs, and ramparts which add nice variety and give you more choices. One element I wish the game had was a campaign mode where you get to keep the same characters and they grow from quest to quest.  There are a couple found online like "The Fire God" and "Places of interest" but they only give your a hero a small bonus if they survive between quests.  You still have to start all over again from zero experience and no items.  However, half the fun and challenge of the game is searching and finding items to build up your party, so starting with good weapons and armor would diminish gameplay some.  I've been play testing some alternatives but it seems to me that the game plays best when you start each quest with a fresh set of heroes.  The game is great to play with 1, 2, 3, or 6 players.  Its just a little awkward with 4 or 5 because you have to split the characters up in an uneven way.  Almost every scenario is meant to be played with 6 heroes.

This game, which has a cool theme and great components, was dull for me. My group emphasized gearing up early in the mission. Once we had good items, we easily crushed the zombies. It turned into a slog to complete the final objective, which was to level a single player all the way up, which felt like a waste of time. Not terrible, but flawed.

Solid components but mediocre gameplay. The hero special powers are bland and indistinctive. The zombies have very surface level differences which do not effect tactical decisions at all. Almost no variety in the scenarios. Surprisingly easy - rules suggest all 6 characters are recommended but I can repeatedly win with just 3. Would maybe find joy in just chucking fistfuls of dice, but many actions only roll a single die. Truly the Michael Bay of boardgames.

Not a bad beer and pretzels game, but can feel like it plays much longer than it should. With some creatures only able to be hurt by specific weapons or combinations, the game can devolve into an interminable race to find that special card in the search deck, and this can cause the game to feel like it lacks meaningful choices for the players. 

It's fun with the right people, and some of the mechanisms are clever, but some aspects drag the general game system to a mere ok.

Fun, if shallow reimplementation of a fun, if shallow game. The game is still too easy for us: we've never had a single character take a single point of damage between us in any Zombicide game. But the game is like a Hollywood summer blockbuster: mindless but just plain fun to play. I was happy to see the stupid friendly-fire rule for ranged attacks fixed here (which we now use in original Zombicide), and I like the addition of magic and fantasy. Looking forward to playing with the dragons, orcs, etc. 

I am secretly hoping CMON moves on to new games at this point (or reboots the original, which I can ignore), because I can no longer justify the expense of the new content for such a fluffy, even if fun, game.

-So much variety with monsters.  I recommend Wulfzburg, Zombie Bosses, crows, deadeye walkers, all the expansion packs with necromancers, plus any others that suit your fancy

This is one of our favorite cooperative games that is easy to teach and a dice fest romp.  Highly recommended.

It's Zombicide. In the Middle Ages. With magic weapons and spells. And Necromancers. 

More of the Zombicide stable but with a fantasy twist. Perfect gateway/intro game for newbies. Also great for a quick game of zombie bashing since set up is so easy and fast.

Also provides a great base game and components for a proper dungeon crawl... but you'd have to make up the rules yourself.

The rating is primarily based on the fact that zombie themes do absolutely nothing for me. As far as I am concerned moving different colored meeples on the board would be more entertaining than a bunch of gray minis. Even if they were a single color to help distinguish small differences like runners versus walkers that would be a huge help.

With that said I did find the game somewhat enjoyable given my dislike of the theme so the mechanics are sound and the co-op nature was very enjoyable as it helped me get thrugh the game. The best thing this game did was give me hope that if I ever can get Robinson Crusoe to the table it will be very enjoyable given the co-op scenario based approach is similar between the two but with a much better theme.

While Zombicide makes you feel like a normal person at a disadvantage, the Black Plague makes you feel more like a hero going against the zombies.  I'm not sure which one I prefer.

The more I play Black Plague, the less I like it.  The AI is dumb (it is zombies so I guess that's a point) and gamey, and the game over stays its welcome.  It's just becoming too repetitive.

The person we play this game with has done a good job of balancing the game's zombie deck and making it more fun (but not necessarily easy).  We've raised the rating a bit.

It's a medium-weight dice-chucker. There's some strategy involved, but since the quests are one-shot it never goes very deep. The quests provided in the base game are too easy, even the "hard" ones. Though I'll admit it's somewhat satisfying to see a giant horde of zombies get completely wiped out when you buff up your team.

I bought this game put it on the shelf and left it there for a while.
Then I played Lobotomy - which was introduced to me as a better, more tactical Zombicide - and was really disappointed.

I was afraid when I tried this and was surprisingly better than that one. This is gorgeous of course as many other CMON games. Also the gameplay has a lot of D6 rolls but not only that one. This is way more tactical than I expected and was overall a good experience.

What I didn't like are three things mainly:
*you have to use all 6 survivors all the time and you have no variety. 
*with 4 and 5 players it takes awkward because a few players will handle 2 survivors while th others only 1.
*there is only 1 abomination figure. Why? I know you can buy more but c'mon, you need at least 2.

Update from 8 to 6:
Massive Darkness is a pure winner over this one.

Dec. 2016: Just played our first scenario and it was quite fun. Not too fond of the lack of variety (only 2 vault cards, 4 different zombie types, 1 necromancer etc) which make it feel like an incomplete game unless you kickstarted it or bought all the expansions. This is probably my biggest problem with modern video games, so I hope I'm wrong and this is a complete game with lots of replayability.

RATING: 9
Fun game, that scratches my itch for a fun, co-op dungeon crawler without the need for a dungeon master.
Rules aren't too complex, which makes this accessible for casual gamers. You pretty much just need one person to know the rule book pretty well, and then the rest learn pretty quickly as the game goes on.
The game mechanics work extremely well in how the zombie phase plays out, despite the lack of a dungeon master, it still offers a surprising amount of strategy which encourages communication and teamwork with your team. The quests are well designed and offer good diversity. Also, the game plays out just as well regardless of the number of people you have playing, since players would just fill in the gaps by playing as more characters.
The production values are pretty solid here, but you get what you pay for. In other words this game doesn't come cheap, which prevents this game from getting a perfect 10, especially if you want to add on the Wulfberg expansion which is recommended.
Also, the difficulty can vary tremendously depending on luck of the draw. I personally don't mind the challenge, but since I'm usually playing this with casual gamers, it can prove to be frustrating for them at times especially when you're often losing more than you're winning. However, we've addressed that by implementing a few house rules to curb the difficulty a bit.
At its best, the game plays out like a good summer blockbuster movie enjoyed over some beer and popcorn - An extremely fun romp that is capable of producing some truly epic gaming moments.

Just stunning! The art, the minis, the player "stations", even the packaging....this game has quality written all over it and it looks GORGEOUS on the table. Can't wait to get the zombie horde and heroes painted up. Probably the best quality minis I've seen in a boxed game, AND SO DAMN MANY!!

The rules are rather deep and can get complex, which has a tendency to bog down the gameplay a bit, but the epic moments that have happened in only 2 sessions of play...AWESOME!

This is a must-own for sure, and I'm very excited about getting the expansions. BUY THIS GAME!

I dont know if it's just the chrome - which isn't a problem for me generally, it's presence inspiring cynicism more than anything - or that coupled with the theme, but as dim as this game is I really enjoy it. It's a veritable dice chucker, but as someone who doesn't really like cooperative games at all, this one works for me. To quantify dim, what I mean is the absolute lack of opacity to the game. Roll a dice to do this. Can I use my hammer to hit down the door? Yes you can. Roll a dice. You have failed to knock down the door. Can I shoot at the zombies. Yes you can. You roll a dice to do it. You have failed to hit them. That sort of thing. 

This game is going for fun factor more than anything else. And by that criteria it succeeds marvellously. You can play this game wrong and still have a good time, there is lots of space for home brewing and house ruling. 

A few criticisms, the rule book is average. It could have been much shorter, it isn't always clear where to find certain rules, though you can read it cover to cover and have a good time, as rules go, but clarity wise it isn't tremendous.

The provided scenarios are nearly all for 6 survivors, which I don't like, it should cater for a full spectrum, as I know some people, myself included, don't like controlling multiple characters, though in all honestly it is quite easy and straight forward to do and i think I would rather have two characters than one when playing with 6 characters.

The game is very expandable in terms of heroes, after adding in wulfsburg and others you will have a farcical glut of hero models. You might be satisfied with the heroes in the base game, the rest are nice to have but not necessary. What I mostly wanted for variety was additional enemies (perhaps even non zombie ones) though perhaps that would break the theme. Secondarily the game would benefit from additional scenarios (now made in the form of a new iteration of this game = green horde).

It has the edge over regular Zombicide in terms of theme in my opinion. In fact I wish The Others had had a medieval setting also - just saying.

Addendum: another recent play with three - perhaps the best player count, this game is just plain fun and is my go to coop and game of this type, with a few provisos.

Basically a Zombicide V. 2.0
Some new ideas are an improvement over Vanilla Zombicide but I very much prefer a modern setting for the zombie theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game comes with deluxe components, detailed miniatures and fine graphics art so much on the modular map tiles as well as on the cards. This is a co-op adventure game somewhere in a medieval city. Hacking zombies down, searching rooms, using magic spells and weapons, opening vaults and attaining objectives. The core game has 10 scenarios, an easy to digest rulesbook with lots of examples and plenty of fine miniatures. The play has team tactics, co-operation and lots of killing different types of zombies. It is fun living tense moments, trying to avoid an endless swarm of zombies and at the same time trying to complete your objectives. A nice addition to the zombie game arsenal.

Really fun game. It's fast-paced and easy to get overwhelmed (DO NOT end your turn on a spawn token!). While it's not a complex game, it does offer up enough meaningful choices to make each turn feel important. I also like that you don't have to role dice for the enemies - keeps things moving. And those minis! Great looking. I do wish the spell cards had more unique art.

A better v2.0 of Zombicide with a fantasy theme tacked on.  Love the character dashboards and just a fun game.

[u]Thoughts[/u]: Not a bad game. I think the combat is perfectly done (arcade-mode hack and slash really works here), but I wish the loot system were heavier -- we should have multiple decks of all different kinds of loot, with each kind only to be found in certain, specific areas of the map. This would force the players into exploring each area in order to stock up on this or that kind of item, rather than having them camp and search from one universal deck until victory is achieved.

All in all though, not a bad game. Looking forward to adding the expansion stuff in to actually find out what I have here.

Első játékra nagyon sok dolog meglepett benne. Leginkább azért mert tele van szerintem totál tematikátlan furcsaságokkal, ami egy ilyen játéknál különösen nehezen értelmezhető. Nem igazán érződik az a kidolgozottság, letisztultság, amit egy negyedik kiadástól azért már elvárna az ember. 
Az ajtónyitással vacakolás, a kevés loot,  a végtelen szobákban való keresgélés elég lelombozó tud lenni.

Ugyanakkor másodjára kifejezetten élveztem. Végig pengeélen táncoltunk, többen is elhullottak, de végül sikerült megoldani a feladatot. És elvileg pont ez az izgalom a játék lényege.

RATING: 7.5
I find the scale really fun, with such huge numbers of zombies bearing down on heroes whose power to slaughter them keeps increasing. My one game of this was overly long, but I think that was particular to the scenario. I was pleasantly surprised by how much tactical planning we had to do, making sure characters were avoiding getting pinned or trapped in a room, or that we weren't relying on a ranged weapon being shot into a space also occupied by a teammate, etc.

游戏模式很简单，游戏元素也不是很多，可以很快上手，推新效果挺不错的，加上玩家板对设计确实相当实用，让游戏体验提升不少。然而正是因为游戏本身元素较少，玩起来个人感觉过于单调，只有直白的骰子点数大小，缺少变化性。游戏主要的体验在于合作，如何根据场上局势分配行动，剧本本身几乎没有剧情，但是不同剧本有不同的设置和不同的任务目标，还是有不同的体验。

A fun Ameri-thrash game. Plays in about an hour with four, which is nice since a lot of similar games have really long playtimes.  The XP system is fun - you can expect to level up at least once in each game and leveling up grants interesting powers.  A lot of interesting items/weapsons to gather which make searching fun.  Combat is well balanced; you can fight well but you won't necessarily win overall due to large influxes of zombie hordes.

Looked good at first. It has great components, and I like the inventory management system. It's too bad the actual play was more boring than not.

Played a six player scenario where my dwarf had a good first couple of turns. After that a combination of poor loot draws and random positioning of monsters led me to do next to nothing for the rest of the game. 

At least you don't have to roll to see if you find anything when you loot, but the random draw still meant that I never got a combat upgrade for the duration of the game. 

Glad I got the play in though, as now I know not to back the Green Horde kickstarter.

Better than the original Zombicide, which I didn't enjoy. This has some of the same problems, like forcing you to put a million miniatures on the board and engage in fiddly movement of them each turn. But I'm not a huge miniature fan, so this is probably just me. 
Actually killing guys and leveling up is a lot of fun, though it's too easy for characters to fall behind the leveling curve and become basically useless.
CMON still hasn't gotten the hang of designing modular boards that I can see well. This, the original Zombicide, and Arcadia Quest all make it hard to tell where walls are and where I can and cannot move.

A solid co-op game. Played it for the first time with six players at my gaming club yesterday. 

We had great fun initially but after a while it felt a bit one-dimensional and repetitive. Would have been nice with some kind of traitor mechanic to spice things up.

That said, it's great for what it is and I'll definitely play it again - perhaps the harder scenarios will prove to be more dynamic when it comes to tactics.

Zombicide gets medieval

Viene a ser lo mismo del ya clasico, pero con armas y ambientacion medieval, asi que ahora las pistolas, hachas de bombero y armas casuales se sustituyen por arcos y ballestas, espadas, hachas de batalla y algunas que otras armas magicas tambien. 

El transplante del esqueje esta conseguido, y algunas de las pegas jugables del original estan moderadas (que no eliminadas). en general queda un juego mas jugable, menos frustrante y mas "redondo". 

En mi opinion sigue sin ser jugablemente un top, pero al menos es mas visitable que el original. 

de expansiones, Yera ya ha comprado unas cuantas: abominaciones, cuervos y alguna que otra cosa mas. Me sorprende que haya una expansion de nigromantes y no la haya comprado todavia.

Great game that is simple enough to play that most people will enjoy playing it. Not just your hardcore board gaming friends.

The set up time can take a bit, but overall I'd highly recommend this game to everyone. Super fun, super easy to play. Just a little head ups, be prepared to lose, sometimes you just can't handle the zombie horde, things will go badly.

RATING: 9.1
I shouldn't really.
I was super excited thinking I would be backing a Zombicide 2.0: Dungeons and Dragons.
But it looks like it is panning out to be zombicide v1.05 the cheesy 80s 90s fantasy movie edition.

I have now played the base set, and it's medievalness is overall, so far, a winner. None of the new rules ruin things, and the new kit and theme make for great fun gaming. 
At least as good as previous seasons. So I've obviously got to give it at least the same rating!
May creep higher when the ks pile is added, and I've yet to play my rue morge for comparing which is the best season to date for me personally. But I'm a sucker for anything with a fantasy theme usually. So am leaning already! 
Haven't wanted, or felt the desire to paint S1-3, but thinking I will go ahead and paint this one. That Necromancer needs to run for the exits in full technicolor regalia

RATING: 6.6
I prefer Zombicide : Black Plague over its post-apocaliptic parent. Having said that, it is very, very similar. I've noted rules / components changes just for the fun of comparing the two:
- Vaults: Black Plague introduces "underground shortcuts" (a.k.a. vaults) that also contain a superior item (like special cars do in modern-day Zombicide).
- Necromancer: I'd call this a new zombie species done just right -except they are not zombies. What I mean by that is - necromancers don't follow the usual rules for moving, don't think like other zombies, which is very refreshing. The fact that they open a spaw point (and players lose if 6 spawn points are open when the necromancer runs away through one) makes them a threat of a different kind. I'll probably try and specialize their spawns a bit in custom-made rules. What I'll definitely do is try and make other zombies more special. Like make the wolvez perceive adventurers by scent (thus ignoring noise and only going to the biggest number of adventurers). It probably won't change them drastically, but it could help. I'd have to test making walkers more stupid (yes, it's possible) by having them move by "following the left wall", until an abomination comes and they then use their normal, standard move. And make fatties attract runners more than they currently do (to serve as shields) - i.e. consider fatties as noise tokens when you move runners, except if they can reach an adventurer in a single round. I strongly believe modern-day Zombicide could use similar flavoring of zombies movement / logic. Making toxic zombies wanting to regroup, for instance. Keeping normal move for berserker zombies only, while normal ones just err until their abomination comes out. I don't know, something.
- 3 life points per adventurer. Yep, that's nice. No zombivor, though. (That speeds games up a bit too.) Oh, and the rules still calls them "survivors", but what the heck - this is fantasy, they have to be "adventurers". :-)
- Armor & shield: this makes adventurers significantly more durable (along with the extra HP). Now we can feel like heroes! Well, at least for a second or two.
- Heal spell: more surviving.
- Ranged target priority change: this has been a game changer for a lot of players (and could be applied as is to modern-day zombicide). No longer do friendlies get selected before zombies when attacking a zone with a mix of friends and zombies. But they do get hit if the attacker misses the die roll, so it's still something you're not sure you want to do.
- Spawning: no random order (i.e. no die roll to select the spawn point). No spawn card for sewers. However there are "double spawn" cards that force the next spawn point to get double the fun. This makes the spawn cards deck deplete very fast, too, thus making "uncommon" spawns happen pretty fast. I've often had necromancers and abominations spawn within 2-to-max-3 turns of the game start.
- Fatties with guts: no sidekicks are spawned with fatties. Thus they seem to spawn somewhat more often.
- Fewer seemingly useless objects. Even "supplies" can be discarted for 1 XP (which would be easy to apply to modern day zombicide).
- No loot loss upon getting hit. I think this helps speed things up a bit. (Just a bit.)
- Starting equipment doesn't feel crap. Actually, most weapons hit on 4+, except some with 3 die or more. It's time to retire frying pans. That surely speeds things up and helps you feel empowered. (This also makes weapons feel more generic, because of the limited differences in characteristics, and the base items deck feels pretty limited because of this.)
- Feel like there are more molotov cocktail components - re-themed to "dragon bile" vial and "torch". Now you feel like you're giving up something when you use the beast, 'cause the torch is expended. And the torch is the equivalent of the flash light.
- The fantasy (middle-age) theme. I like that much more, actually. Now I feel like I could get a whole monster compendium and feel it very thematic.
- Plastic dashboards for characters: these are welcome. They make your character feel a bit more concrete, too. The backpack inserts are a bit fuggly, though, and you'll find yourself bumping cards out of it unwillingly. But they're still an improvement.
- 5 items backpack (instead of 3), and a 3rdslot (for armor or a specific item to your character). Now we're talking about looting!
- Fewer existing expansions and custom scenarios.
- More "village-like" maps. Narrow streets, small buildings. They feel good exploring.
- Only 2 "artifacts" (i.e. super-loot items). And none in the first expansion. And none for melee characters - even though there are 3 paths (melee, ranged, magic). I don't really understand that choice. In fact, fatty-killing weapons are often ranged,and I personally feel like it's nto very balancedto have thecrossbow as powerful as it currently is (it doesn't need a reload, rolls 2 dice, hits on 4+, range 1-2; vs a sword that has a single damage point. Only the hammer has 2 damage, but it rolls a single die.)
- No cars. No horses either. (And no, no steam-punk trains. But a steam-punk themed zombicide would be awesome!)
- Many melee weapons open doors on a die roll. (The axe does this automatically. but not the hammer. What the heck.) Now that speeds things up a bit too, in my view. even if I still hate rolling a die to open a door. I mean, OK, it can fail once, what the heck. But I've seen myself rolling up to 10 times to open a door. I mean TEN TIMES. Does this make any sense? It certainly makes for no fun.

I consider that I'm done with this game. Unfortunately, I started mainting the minis. I need to bring the halfway-though ones to a stable state to be able to part with the game.

For us, definitely a step-up from the "modern" Zombicide series. The plastic player boards and expanded equipment options are great. Rating did drop a bit for us in wake of games that are simply more fun to play. Massive Darkness, with the same gameplay style, gets the edge over this. Still, this can be a lot of fun if the group gets into it.

I think I'd rate it higher if I could find people that would stop complaining about the zombie genre and just have some good ole zombie smashing fun. Haters...

Having never played Zombicide, I didn't know what to expect. In the end, I had a lot of fun. It's definitely a beer and pretzels game but I can see it being a great time with a few people sitting around the table bashing monsters. I like the (extremely) light RPG aspects of the inventory and experience/skills. I did feel like I was lacking some feeling of exploration that I would like in a dungeon crawler (yes, I know this isn't strictly a dungeon crawler), but I was happy with the zombie-rush in its place. That aspect reminded me a lot of Ghost Stories, which is a good thing.

Bad points: the fact that finishing a quest might require certain items, but it might take ages to actually find those items feels like a chore. I would have preferred there to be, say, treasure chests which may contain the items you need, so in the end you have to search a limited number of them before you find the items (kind of like the objective tiles).  Some of the items/spells also feel a bit unbalanced and it's annoying to be in a situation where only one character (+inventory) is useful but he/she is needed in multiple places on the board. With five other characters sitting around scratching their asses, it can be frustrating/boring for the other player(s).

RATING: 6
Cooperative game where each player takes the role of one character and tries to fulfill every specific mission while surviving the zombie apocalypse. The game is a sort of dungeon crawler that has some interesting mechanics, like the noise mechanics, CMON miniatures and a very good components, but, someway, somehow, it doesn't work. I have played 2 times, and I have not enjoyed any of those. I think that the game is not fun enough. One thing that I do not really find a good idea, even if it is related to the noise mechanic that I have already highlighted, is the fact that you can be stuck for some time trying to open a door. This issue, fortunately, has been solved in Massive Darkness, just spend a movement action and door opened. Who had the idea of throwing dice just because of it?
The miniatures, we all agree (I guess) that CMON miniatures worth, by themselves, the price of buying the game but, in this case, I do not really like the miniatures. I am not saying that are not cool, is maybe the theme what I don't like. I prefer more different miniatures that just a bunch of zombies all of them almost equal.
I am more thinking about rating this game with a 5, but the miniatures and the components have to be taken into account but, sadly, I do not enjoy the game, I cannot go higher than 6.

Fantastic hack and slash that ramps up the difficulty beautifully as you play. Almost every game has been a nail biter finish with multiple memorable moments. Looking forward to adding the rest of the KS content to the base game to have more room to customize the party of survivors and the zombie horde. Definitely a keeper, although length of play can be a hindrance to getting it on the table, especially when missions include things like "Get one survivor into the Red level of experience" as a win condition. Grinding out XP for 15 minutes after you've gotten all the other objectives is not fun. Likewise, having to search through the item deck to find all the food in order to win is not all that fun. I've easily enjoyed the missions that are simply moving around and killing zombies while trying to get to different points that have some surprise triggers along the way far more than the others.

The reasons I love Zombicide still hold true for Black Plague. It creates a play space for players to evaluate the risks and odds between the different options for meeting an objective and then working together when the plan inevitably goes all to hell. 

What changes in Black Plague, besides the obvious period weaponry? The best change is when you are targeting into a tile where characters also are. In regular Zombicide, you hit player characters before you hit any zombies, which makes ranged combat very problematic. In BP, you only hit your characters if you miss the zombies. This is still problematic, but a little more logical. Players move in a set turn order. Line of site is more restrictive indoors (also logical). The only impact change for the zombies is the introduction of the necromancer, who creates a new spawn point wherever he appears. The necromancer, when not engaged, tries to run. If he escapes before you kill him, all of the spawn points stay. If you catch and kill him, then you get to remove ANY spawn point on the board. This is truly and new tactical twist that the original Zombicide did not possess.

UPDATE: After a few plays, I downgraded my score a point and traded it away. Ultimately, there just isn't as much variety in this version versus the regular version. Magic was mostly just another ranged weapon. I'm sure expansions will improve this aspect, but it not worth investing in when I have plenty of regular Zombicide.

After one play, seems harmless enough; more interesting than Zombies or Maul of America and less rage-inducing than Last Night on Earth. Much of the game play is automatic, but there are a few interesting tricks with using noise to lure zombies away from other survivors and, with a team of six survivors, there are enough characters to think about task allocation and how best to split up/stay together.  If you have a zombie-sized hole in your inventory, this will be an adequate fill.

I wish the campaign had character progression but see the problem with implementing it (after one mission, characters will have most of the best gear in the deck).

Zombicide: Black Plague is a spin-off of the original Zombicide, but in my mind is superior in every way. The fantasy setting ames the game much more thrilling, the characters seem to have more life, and the abilities are much cooler. Setup doesn't take too incredibly long, surprisingly, and it's fairly easy to explain to newcomers. A few of the rules for sound and sight take some getting used to, but overall nothing is too incredibly difficult to grasp.

Overall, the game is a blast. Nothing beats fighting hordes of zombies with your friends. A solid addition to anyone's collection!

For me the core game works, well. The expansions have no guidance on how to balance and often adding them dilutes the spawn deck making it easier, only one worth getting-deadeyes. I have everything, it gets unbalanced with all aboms etc. You also HAVE TO HOUSERULE for 12 aboms.

Buy the core, save some money, play it vanilla, it's great.

I've become kind of numb to zombies with the glut of games out there with that played-out theme.  For some reason, changing the context from a modern day viral zombie outbreak to a medieval fantasy undead uprising via necromancers feels fresh.  It provides a fun coop dungeon-crawl-esque experience as your party runs about a fallen medieval cityscape carving paths through the undead hordes trying to complete their objectives without getting overwhelmed.

It's Zombicide. It's an okay way to pass some time but I still find several bits of the rules too wonky to give it much credit as a game. The minis are fine, but I'm not much of a minis person so that aspect is somewhat lost on me.

RATING: 7
Definitely a game you'll like better if you play more than one character per person.  Without it, too many game turns are "I take a swing, and miss".  End of turn.  It's difficult to establish a strong sense of teamwork in this game, and it can get boring.  I hear the expansion improves the game play, but I'm not yet inspired enough to make the purchase.  There are just better co-op games out there.  It's a bummer the minis aren't painted and doing so is a huge undertaking (undead pun!)

Does a good job of making your character feel like a powerful badass who can dish out major damage, but don't get cocky, as it's easy to get overwhelmed by zombies, and a minor mistake can still get you killed. As Amerithrash goes, this is one of the better ones.

I went in on this just to get back into painting minis but was very surprised how fun this game is. Once set up, it flows well and the rules are very basic. If you can get 3 to 4 people together this can been one fun  cooperative game. Only issue is the Hero's are not very balanced in the basic set and everyone wane the same 3, oh well "dice roll".

Zombicide: Black Plague takes the zombie apocalypse into a fantastical medieval setting! The arcane powers of the Necromancers have unleashed a zombie invasion in the age of swords and sorcery, and it's up to your group of straggling survivors to not only stay alive during these dark times, but to take back the realm and punish those responsible for the apocalypse!

Zombicide: Black Plague allows you take control of paladins, dwarves, knights, and magicians, wielding powerful swords, crossbows, and even magic spells to defeat the zombie hordes and its Necromancer overlords. The classic Zombicide rules have been revamped for this new incarnation of the game, while still retaining the nonstop action, tense atmosphere and easy-to-learn rules that made Zombicide a classic. Equip your survivor with equipment like chainmail armor or shields to defend against the undead, pick up spell books to perform fantastic enchantments, or light up a pool of dragon bile to create an all-consuming inferno of dragon fire!

I'm a eurogamer through and through. I like nothing more than a game that rewards deep strategy and optimal ganmeplay. But the Ameritrash genre of miniatures heavy boardgames has always had a certain appeal to me. My experiences thusfar with the genre have been hit or mis for me. I don't care for Blood Rage and X-Wing and I absolutely hated Eldritch Horror and Elder Sign. But I love the fantasy themed Runebound. I decided I wanted to try a dungeon crawl type of game so I bought Zombicide Black Plague. The theme appealed to me but I also liked that it's a cooperative game.

My wife and I played this three times over the weekend. I liked the tutorial quest. I loved the first quest. And I thought the second quest was fantastic. With each play I started to enjoy this game more and more. When I'm not playing the game, I'm thinking about the game. I suspect this could grow and become my favorite game of all time.

In Zombicide Black Plague, 1-6 players work together to complete objectives while fighting off zombies and necromancers in a mediëval fantasy setting. Players can play with up to 6 survivors in the base game. Most are human, but among the cast of characters are a wizard, a dwarf and an elf. The base game contains 11 quests varying in playtime from 90 minutes to 180 minutes. 

The game oozes theme. When you open up this huge box and place the tiles and miniatures on your table, you're instantly transported to this alternate fantasy realm. Zombicide is the boardgame equivalent of Hollywood blockbuster. It's grandiose, action packed, and there is something to enjoy for everyone. I still am surprised how much I enjoy this game. I can't wait for my next session.

Ein echt cooles Zombiecite. Das Setting ist cool. Mein Magier hat die Gegner massenweise dahingerafft, mein Zwerg hat den Hammer geschwungen und eigentlich kaum getroffen ;). Der Elb war... nunja, er war auch dabei und hat sogar ab und an was richtig gemacht. Okay, sie waren alle recht gut, aber der Magier, der hat sie alle in den Schatten gestellt! ;)
Mein Mitspieler hat eine Pfütze generiert (hat sich wohl in die Hosen gemacht), die ich dann angezündet habe um das Monster-Zombie zu töten. Wir haben das Labor gesucht und es war natürlich im letzten Raum, wer hätte das gedacht. Wir haben Zombies geschnetzelt, haben an Erfahrung gewonnen und sind aufgesiegen. Es kamen immer mehr und mehr Zombies, aber sie hatten keine Chance gegen uns... gegen uns und MEINEN Magier ;).
Sehr cooles Spiel. Geschnetzel auf hohem Niveau ;).
Alle Helden werden unter den Spielern aufgeteilt. Welchen Held an der Reihe ist führt 4 Aktionen durch (laufen, Gegenstand einsetzen, suchen, etc.). Nachdem jeder Held was getan hat agieren die Zombies. Das war im Groben auch schon die Regelzusammenfassung.
Sehr schön, gefällt mir gut.

The game was fun!  I've been itching to play any title in this series and finally got to.  While I do enjoy fantasy themes, I'd prefer regular Zombicide to this one as I just think the modern theme fits better with zombies.  This just felt like a loose rendition of D&D. Still, with five of us playing, it was a fun game and I picked it up pretty quickly thanks to a good teacher.  Combat is pretty straight forward with a few caveats here and there.  The miniatures are very cool and the momentum at which the zombies spawned was urgency-inducing.  There is something that felt rather vanilla about this, in the sense that I was going through the motions sometimes.  Otherwise, I'd definitely play again. Oh, there are a TON of characters to choose from to when picking who you'll be.

Loooove the components and the gameplay. It's simple and lean and gives so much fun if played with the right people. Spawning random zombies is a cool element, the more the beter, haha!
The game can be played up to 6 people, however the setup doesn't change. This means that the game is very hard with only two people, and too easy with 6 (though we had a great time opening random doors, adding more zombies to the game). 
The game also ends very abruptly. You either win or loose. When the goal is met, the game ends, even though you are surrounded by loads of zombies, I'd like to see a game where we win by eliminating the source. 
Though the game looks gorgeous, the theme doesn't fit very well.. zombies in a medieval/fantasy setting? Maybe dead skeletons would fit better, 
Ah well, forget about it, let's slay these zombies!! Argh!!

I really enjoy playing Zombicide. I would say the core-box is ok but the expansions just make the game really interesting.

Luxurious components, great theme and setting, truly captures the hack and slash aspect of RPGs like DnD.  Good, intuitive and"realistic" play mechanics.  Longer than expected which affects the ability to play it (will take up most of play session and leave little time/energy for other games other than lighter fare).  Possibly overproduced but if one can afford it it's luxurious.  Not sure about how long it would stay fresh with repeated plays before possibly becoming repetitive, we'll have to try and see.

Usually I very much dislike co-op Dungeon-Crawl-type of games, because most of them are pretty dull and boring due to unintelligent AI. However, even though the AI in Zombicide is not really cleverer, I can accept it, because Zombies are not supposed to be clever. They walk at you and attack. It works thematically and mechanically very well. You are not confronted with powerful or intelligent foes, but with a hord of Zombies. Sooner or later they cut off your escape route and overwhelm you. It makes thematic sense and it is a lot of fun. Killing them seems easy at first, but beware, things can turn around in an instant. One moment everything was fine, the next moment your Survivor is no more. 

The game looks great and plays intuitive, without any unnecessarily complex rules. The components are top notch and the expansions add cool things.

Despite the components being much better than normal zombicide this game has no real theme - by which I mean it just does'nt feel like a zombie apocalypse - It feels more like a dungeon crawl. Think I was begrudgingly have to sell this despite the hours of painting all the standard zombies

What a riot! This game gives you the epic feel of a zombie movie. Hordes of zombies crowd the streets, they shamble out of dark corners and some rage with ferocity.

Zombicide with a fantasy theme! It certainly has a slightly different feel with some of the game additions/tweaks... it still looks great and plays great. A big win!

Just outstanding: if you want a game with lots of zombie-killing, soft role touch and amazing moments like in your series/movies/videogames... this is your game!

Ah, and you must love the medieval stuff and all that. If you want guns and all that, try Rue Morgue. Incredible anyway.

I am a proudly owner of the spanish version. Gracias Edge!

I thought it was a dungeon crawler but you are discouraged from fighting, its more about reaching an objective than killing zombies and for this reason didn't appeal to me. also there are 200 playable heroes but very little equipment in comparison

Play twice at the game shop. Introduction scenario is easy. I like the setting that we don't need to act like terminator to achieve the objective. Play time is around 2hrs but seems like there is a lot of cleanup work after, common problem for the miniature game.

Good 
Entertaining dice chucking game where you level up character(s) and complete objectives. It is pretty much a dungeon crawl but with more slaughter that is usually found in dungeon crawls. 

Bad
The difficulty vastly swings depending on the loot and spawn cards pulled. An unlucky series of deals and its almost a guaranteed game over, where as a lucky series of loot cards can make for an extremely easy game to the point of being dull. 

Additionally, there isn't enough variety in the core box so I would also say if you plan on putting time into this game Wolfsburg, the Bosses Abomination Pack, Hero Box, and the Deadeye Walkers (and/or ravens) are required.

This newest incarnation of Zombicide is quite a departure from the original... at least in the theme department. The rules and gameplay remain similar to the original but with a few alterations that make for a better game experience. The theme will divide opinion but it's original and all of the miniatures and artwork are as awesome as ever.

Update 5.3.2017 - Finally got a chance to play this, Unfortunately not a fan and didn't work well for my frequent gaming group.  Even my new gaming friends commented that it felt too simple and too luck based.  for the 1.5-4 hours it takes to play this game there are a lot of other things I'd rather see hit the table.

Pros: Dice Chucking slashing game
Beautiful - and I mean beautiful - miniatures.  When someone with even a little talent paints these things they look so cool and it really helps with the theme.
Easy to teach/pick up for new players to expose them to a dice throwing dungeon crawl type of experience
Zombies - one of my favorite themes

Cons: entirely too much luck involved.  Abominations require 3 damage weapon to kill (which doesn't exist), or dragon bile + a torch, which requires finding both items...in a stretch of bad luck ours were in the bottom of the deck.  
Repetitive.  The different quests offer different setups and objectives but at the end of the day the game boils down to slaying zombies.  Roll to see if you hit, if you do, you kill the zombie assuming you have a weapon that does enough damage.  

Overall: If you enjoy spending the time painting - get it for sure.  I'm certain it would be a little more fun to play with painted heroes and zombies, the detail as usual is awesome.  For my group though it just isn't worth the shelf space or play time when there are other games we know we enjoy more that we could play in the limited game time we have.

We play this with a couple house rules to ensure one player isn't left with nothing to do.  I am not fond of the fact that every. Single. Scenario. In the game is for 6+ players. I would really have liked more player count variations.  But still, all in all, this is a great zombie game that is both fun and campy. Quality components, as expected from CMON, and a fun bad rule set that can be easily tweaked as needed.

One of the best games ever and definitly an improved Zombicide version
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
ZCIDE Fantasy version. Best edition by far. They fixed all the issues that had to be house ruled in the previous versions. 

PROS: 
Characters can use armor (new body slot)
No more loose item on wound
3 wounds
better friendly fire rules
5 cards in backpack ( reserve)
Necromancer.
Tiles have more zones which means you get bigger city with lesser Tiles.

If Fantasy is your thing and want to jump into Zombicide this is where you should start and forget the previous versions. 

CONS:
game difficulty is easy.
need expansion to crank up difficulty. 
some heroes are OP like ironrain on silas the archer.

I may rate this slightly higher for dungeon crawler enthusiasts.  I normally like story-driven legacy games, RPGs, and strategy games like Pandemic Legacy, Sherlock Holmes CD, Eldritch Horror, and Time Stories. I ended up with this when I couldn't find anything else at the store.  To my surprise, the excellent components and variety of items make this a fantastic dungeon crawler.  It has less story than say Mice & Mystics but more soul than the typical AD&D board game.  If you're into taking out waves of zombies, equiping items D&D style, faster one night games, and coop play, this is an excellent choice.  I'll definitely invest in some expansions.

Decent game but the playtimes are really inconsistent and can range from 1hr to 4hrs on longer scenarios. As a result it is difficult to get it played. Also, controlling 6 players or multiple players for solo is generally not my favorite solo mechanism to use. 

A solid solo variant could have saved this for me.

This game does not scale with the number of players. If you play solo you just play all six characters which is great for decision making, but means that you just have to manage a lot of stuff and the table creep is the same as with 6 players. Game itself is fun enough, you just get swamped with zombies and try to not die. The starting equipment is trash so you spend half the game trying to get powerful enough to kill zombies, by which time it's crushingly difficult.

I enjoyed this far more than I thought I would. The game is very simple, but it's also a lot of fun at the same time. It's a game of gathering up equipment and taking out zombies left and right, and it makes for a great time. My only real problem with the game's system is that you can have some anti-climactic finishes if the zombies manage to overwhelm a character and take them out in a single turn. Also, games can run a little longer than I'd like them to. I wish they could keep games of this down to an hour, but you're looking at a couple hours a game, on average. Most of the scenarios can feel samey, but that's fine since the experience of taking out zombies in this game is a lot of fun. Plus I'm sure you could make up your own scenarios if you wanted to.

This completely replaces other dungeon crawl games like Descent for me. Not only are the rules so much cleaner and smoother, but it's completely cooperative. Rather than having to roll attack dice versus defense dice, you just roll to see how much damage you do, and zombies do a certain amount when they hit you. It's very easy to teach, despite the overlong rule book, and the different characters make for a fresh experience every time.

RATING: 3
I have no idea how Zombicide (any version) ever ranks so high. The doubling rule is one of the worst rules ever. The zombies split if they are the same distance. Most people I know just ignore this rule because it is silly. Also, if you make lots of progress and die, you feel completely useless with a new character and that really ruins immersion or connection. I will stick to Eldritch Horror for my  horror. I will say that the minis and game itself is pretty. I am guessing people paid a ton of money so they feel like they should rank this really high.

The minis, which help make this game great, are wonderfully detailed with a dose of homage to the fantasy genre.

A few flaws mar this otherwise excellent co-op dungeon crawl. First, its easy to have a character who isn't as effective or fun as the others. Second, the game can end very unexpectedly despite everything going perfectly otherwise. Finally, the overwhelming horde of zombies, while impressive and frightening, is difficult to manage correctly. However, if you like zombies and you like dnd, then this game's theme can really suck you in.

Since Zombicide is my favorite game, this new version has a tough time living up to the original. The theme of the original is so perfect for me in it's modern day era. So, Black Plague will never quite live up to the zombie apocalypse reality the original Zombicide creates  for me. The new theme with it's Necromancers is a little bit more  on the fantasy side, but it's still good. Don't get me wrong, I do like Black Plague. Let me tell you why I like it...

In Black Plague the new individual player boards are very nice. I think the character sheets are a little small and I do long for the long character sheets of the original game, but I understand they probably already are expensive to make as is. The game play and artwork are very nice for the medieval era. The artwork is a little more on the dull side, but I think that is necessary for the time period. The missions are great. 
The Necromancer's are a force to be reckoned with and  along with the Double Spawn cards they are deadly. 

But there are some things I don' t like. For example, the new fatty rule of not coming with friends. This isn't very challenging and  I miss seeing him with his friends. Whenever we play the original game, I love hearing new players' reactions to the fatty arriving with an entourage.  The biggest problem I have with the game is the lack of excitement from the deck of items. There really isn't much fun variety and humor delving in that deck. Once you have drawn a sword, a dagger, a shield, and a spell...there isn't much left to draw from the deck. It certainly won't look much different anyway. For example, lets say you draw a second spell that doesn't even look any different but claims to be. This is where the excitement falls a little flat for me. Possibly it's the artwork on the cards that could be better. 

In the original game, you might draw a zombie, water, or a chainsaw. Who knows? I never mind seeing a water bottle or canned food...it's just funny! It just increases the anticipation of getting something good from the deck. I have played with new gamers that get so caught up in seeing what cool weapon they might get from the deck that they really become useless to our survival as a team...but that too is funny! In Black Plague the salted meat is funny and you do get somewhat of that anticipation feeling when you draw something new, but it's not as good.

Anyway, I will play this game and have a great time. But I forsee it cannot compete with the original for me and will probably not reach the table as often. I say this but...currently as I write these comments I have Zombicide all set up to play tonight, but I am also thinking I want to play Black Plague as a switch of scenery.

*只有房間可能會有兩格為一區，否則通常一格一區，視線在室外直線到底，往室內有開門狀態只能穿過一個房間，移動則相連格一區一步
>搜索 只能在沒喪屍的建築物裡做，抽裝備卡，可馬上重排身上裝備，每回合只能做一次
>開門 使用有開門效果的裝備卡來開門，骰點不被攻擊效果加乘，特殊顏色門要拿特定裝備開，第一次開門時，建築物每個房間抽一張喪屍卡生怪(其他效果卡額外結算，雙生卡生在下一格)，起始就開門的不會生怪
*地下室可從外面或裡面花一個行動開，但是最相鄰方間都沒有視野，開地下室不生怪，可被搜索，對應裝備如果放在地下室時可花一個行動拿取不算搜索行動
>重整交易 重整身上裝備或跟同區一位腳色交換裝備卡(被交換的也可重整)
>攻擊 使用對應裝備擲骰檢定，遠距攻擊時受傷順位為普通>肥仔或大怪>跑步>巫師，如果攻擊區有友方，則每個沒中檢定改為對其造成傷害，傷害力是該武器的傷害值
*裝備卡 有門符號的可以開門(如果要丟骰就骰值要超過)，四格依序為距離/骰數/骰點超過算命中/傷害，最左邊標示是否會製造噪音(放在對應區，一次行動上限1個)，有雙劍符號的裝備如果兩手裝備一樣可同時使用(目標要在同區)，上方標示經驗值要多少才能使用，需要重新裝填的武器要花一個行動重裝，下回合會自動重裝
*龍油卡可丟對應標記在某個地板，之後丟火把在該地時可消滅上面所有喪屍
*腳色卡下方標示經驗值，正常殺一隻一點，其他任務物品可能也有，過顏色可學新技能，用標記標示之，可能多選一，生怪時，使用場上倖存者最高等級顏色來生怪
>強化咒語 對目標強化，可對自己，每張每回合使用一次
>拿取或啟動物件
>製造一點噪音
>跳過
*每個腳色可拿8張卡，兩手裝備，身體裝備跟背包5張(背包卡沒作用)，隨時可棄
2.喪屍階段 
>所有喪失一個一個行動，同區有人的攻擊，沒人的移動，攻擊幾個造成幾點傷害(記錄在玩家圖版左上)，如果有裝備可擲骰抵擋，三點傷害後該倖存者就移除，多個玩家傷害自由分配(如果傷害可殺掉一人怎可犧牲一人抵銷所有傷害)，移動時往有視線且噪音最多的前進(每個倖存者視為一點噪音)，並走最多路徑，多條則分群(不等分加一隻)
*裝甲可丟骰減傷，盾牌如果同時有裝甲可重丟檢定一次，也可單純檢定盾牌就好
>生怪 根據任務地圖在對應生怪區抽排放對應喪屍，特殊顏色的根據任務需求，額外啟動卡不生怪，讓對應類型的所有喪屍行動一次，多生卡則是下區生兩次，如果最後抽到加抽在第一個抽怪區，沒模型可放時，全部放完，然後對應類型全部行動一次
**喪屍列表 
>普通喪屍  傷害一可消滅，經驗值一
>肥仔 傷害二可消滅，經驗值一
>跑步 傷害一可消滅，經驗值一，每次做兩個行動
>大怪 傷害三可消滅，經驗值五，受到他的傷害不能用盔甲丟骰檔，需要使用特殊道具消滅之
>巫師   傷害一可消滅，經驗值一，進場時放對應的生怪標記並且生怪一次，之後生怪階段也會生，之後抽到的巫師生怪卡改為巫師行動一次，巫師如果該區沒倖存者則往另外一個生怪區移動，當他在逃跑區的生怪點行動時移除隻並放一個額外的生怪點，殺掉他時可以去除一個任意的生怪點(如果還有對應巫師的改成基礎顏色生怪點)當沒有生怪點可放時(場上六個要在放時)遊戲失敗

Guys this game is fantastic. If the prolific amount of content that I own for it isn't indication enough, this is also the game that finally got me to start painting miniatures and I am dedicated to painting all of my content for this game. I also bought the 3D doors and plastic tokens because I felt they were worth it to make the game that much more thematic and beautiful. I absolutely adore this game. It is very thematic, and I know zombie games seem overdone but taking it back to a fantasy setting really brought life to a stale theme. I love the way that you get more powerful as you level up but the difficulty also ramps up exponentially. The game is deceptively simple to play. Just because it's simple, though, doesn't mean it isn't hard! My fiance and I are up to scenario seven and man some of those scenarios felt just impossible the first time we tried them. One thing I will say is if you are not a fan of taking your time to tool up, you probably won't like this game. I find that a lot of our games the first 15 minutes are spent really just searching through the equipment deck finding the stuff you need to really be effective. If you don't spend the time doing this, you're probably not going to make it. Once you hit that orange level on a character, the heat is on and you better be ready!

Very nice player boards, artwork and minis, some good ideas of weapon equipping and dual wielding. But thats about it. Where is the storyline? A fully co-op game that light must have an interesting story text(s) to captivate me or at least human opponent(s) controlling zombies.. or both. The board is also super simple, so mostly you dont have much choices what to do on your turn. No hidden information in a co-op is also a big turn off for me - even if there is not an alpha gamer at table, its still a puzzle with open information and I cannot put my unique input into the strategy.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Enjoy the game thoroughly. Given the relatively basic system, it's VERY easy to house rule things that are too easy. Currently we play with 4 survivors and a scaling health-based Abomination system that's kept track of with a single D6. In addition, there is a limited number of searches per square, which encourages actually exploring rather than holing up in a room and just camping in perpetuity until you find all the good items. That being said, I could see the base game played at vanilla as being both too easy and boring for repeated play, where the most threatening thing is a group of Runners getting an extra activation. When you add Crowz, Deadeye Walkerz, Wolfz, and Trollbominations, things start to become FAR more tense. Because zombie spawns happen after player actions, you need to account for worst-case scenarios and always keep an eye on a Necromancer trying to hoof it for an escape (and likely a game loss), so literally holing up in a corner can be a terrible idea. This game has the perfect mixture of strategy and dice-chucking to keep it moving, but also to think about your current strategy before proceeding.

Regole semplici e abbastanza intuitive, tradotte bene, comprensibili e senza refusi, cosa molto rara in Italia ultimamente. Il gioco mette ansia, le miniature sono belle, le illustrazioni di più. Anche i giocatori alle prime armi potranno trovare il loro spazio. Per vincere sembra che servano le super combo di equipaggiamento ma in realtà serve comunicazione e coordinamento tra i giocatori. La sua profondità è data dall'esperienza che si vive insieme come metagame.

I'm a bit disappointed after my first play. I had some high hopes about this game, due to the very high average rating (8.1 on 06/08/2016) and this being in fact a remake of the original (= it can be more polished). But it didn't feel polished at all. During our first game a lot of questions arise for whom we couldn't find an answer in the rulebook. For example, you should expect that the movement of the zombies would be crystal clear in a new version, but it wasn't (for instance: can zombies hear the noises through a door that is still closed when determining how they should move?). All those uncertainties made that Quest 1 took 2 hours instead of the 60 minutes it should have been.

We just love this game.  The slow but uncontrollable swell of zombie hordes are both anxiety producing and exhilarating.

I like co-ops in general, but Zombicide - Black Plague in this reincarnation - has not clicked for me: it's probably the theme (I've tired of The Walking Dead)... and I've realised that I just don't care if I win or not. Conversely, I'd be be happy to play Dead of Winter (the zombies are just representative of some existential threat, or so I've been told). It rarely helps any game when my dice rolling skills are crap, so I was not upset to have to bail out on Z:BP, which was actually a boon for the group, with someone else rolling my character's dice.

A fun simple dungeon crawler (ish) game. I like that the rules are fairly streamlined and the AI is pretty easy to run but still does sensible moves most of the time. I like how the player characters are different and gain new useful items over the course of the game. There's nothing I particularly dislike about it, but the game system is also not particularly clever or interesting. It gets the job done, but there's nothing that makes me say "That was really cool, I have to play it again!"

This was the first chance I had to play a dungeon crawler as a co-op, and I really enjoyed that aspect of it. However, the first scenario went insanely long (at least two hours) just because all the torches were hanging out near the bottom of the deck. I'm worried that bad luck could result in a really unfun session, but I'd still play again.

Everything is really good about this game.  Zombicide is strange in the respect that if you look at it...it looks like you are just moving and rolling dice to beat zombies...but I've never had a coop that has had so many great decisions in it that you must figure out as a team.(both BP and regular Zombicide).  The best laid plans came sometimes come undone...and while it's random to some degree: it isn't because you KNOW the enemies could possibly do that.  I've been screwed over by both being too cautious and being too aggressive.  I think it's a great game

Enjoy this more than modernicide S2+TCM (which was my favorite of moderncide). The player dashboards are so simple yet brilliant and definitely help clean up and issue from moderncide. There is a lack of variety from no beserker or toxic zombies but this is fixed with dealing with necromancers or zombie wolves, also deadeye walkers help with this. Essentially berserker/toxic zombies were lost but priorities change to stopping those necromancers instead. Also the rule changes regarding ranged combat into a zone with friendlies was much needed. 

I do miss the berserker abomination, but adding in additional bosses or special neros provide different types of challenges.

Regalo de Quintano

Lo mejor del juego es la estetica, es un juego muy bien producido. Como juego es ligero en cuanto a complejidad, la toma de decisiones radica en decidir el orden idoneo de hacer las acciones, y contra que enemigo si fuera el caso.
En caso de jugar con jugadores noveles en esto de los juegos de mesa, puede darse el caso (me paso a mi) que al ser un juego cooperativo pero donde se gana experiencia por muertes y objetivos, tengan la mentalidad competitiva a pesar de que se lo expliques y a la hora de jugar vayan un poco a su aire sin mirar por el bien del grupo. Las reglas son de facil lectura y estan bien explicadas.Lo peor el precio, no digo que no lo merezca pero si que es muy elevado y que si te metes en expansiones entonces se combierte en un juego para mi muy caro para lo que ofrece, con esto no digo que no caiga alguna expansion, ya que ha sido un regalo.

Kicked it.  

Played with my wife and two sons (10 and 8).  The eight year old required a little help (use your "plenty of arrows, son"), but the ten year old was on top of everything for the most part. 

It's very fun.  It's not as challenging as I thought it would be, but maybe that's because we've been playing the "easy" quests.  Playing medium or hard will probably fix that.

I look forward to trying out the expansion and all the kickstarter extras that are coming next year...

One note: just like with most games, this game takes a lot longer to play out scenario than what it says on the quest.

:thumbsup: Deals with the problems of its predecessors in an elegant way (amongst others: no longer automatically hitting allies first with ranged combat).
:thumbsup: The switch to a fantasy theme instead of modern day opens up a lot of possibilities, both in looks and gameplay. Things that would jump the shark in a modern setting, work perfectly.
:thumbsup: Necromancers are a cool, tense addition.
:thumbsup: Gorgeous miniatures. Painters will enjoy these! Great illustrations.
:thumbsup: Tweaks to the Zombie deck (like more and more frequent Fatties) are a lot of fun.

----

:thumbsdown: Scenario design is still all over the place as far as difficulty is concerned...
:thumbsdown: CMON almost buries you with a plethora of expansions. Don't be tempted too much, because set-up becomes a bigger chore the more options you add (even though the options themselves are fun).
:thumbsdown: I don't enjoy multiplayer games, as you can be out of the action for too long. But it works great as a solo game.

Tried this, and it was exactly what I expected: A light, dice-rolling, thematic game that's fun, but not something I'd want to play very often. But sometimes, sure. 

Also, it's RIDICULOUS that there's only one weapon in the entire search deck that can kill an abomination.

Co-operative survival horror miniatures game.

Pro: Easy to learn and teach, tiles and components can be used to create a near-infinite number of scenarios.

Con: Expect scenarios to take a LOT longer than expected, given the random elements involved (dice rolling, decks of cards, tile placements).

Simple Game, normally the best moments of this game comes from the themathic theme more than the game mechanics most of the game it is resolved with a dice role. But still i have good times playing with my friend that like it. Not a game for eurogamers.

RATING: 7.25
ZBC is commonly criticized as a flawed “sandbox” game that is unbalanced and allows abuse of certain game mechanics. Others praise it's virtues for it's flexibility, and that it can be "tweaked" with multiple house-rules and variants without “breaking” the game. I fall somewhere in-between, but lean more heavily towards praising it since it's intuitive, streamlined and simple to play...which isn't a fault for me with this game. If it was a heavier, campaign-based game I think the unbalanced issues with the game would be unforgivable. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
This is not a good game and it is very unbalanced. Have played it twice, the first time I found some powerful bow and was able to stand in the middle of the board and destroy all zombies. Which was kind of OK but not much fun for everyone else.

Second time got stuck in the blue level while everyone else went zooming off into the orange, so the spawning zombies were too tough for my character to fight. At one point one the players was rolling 25 dice on his turn and me just three. Not a lot of fun waiting 15 - 20 minutes for your turn to do just three things that take 30 seconds and then another 15 minute wait while your friends lay waste to board.

Like the idea, but the experience tracker just makes everyone as selfish as hell and plays into the hands of the min max'ers. Slightly more fun when I was wasting the board but awful when you get stuck at low levels. Not one for me.

Zombicide Black Plague had so much going for it, great mix of themes, Period, Plague, Swords & Sorcery AND ZOMBIES!!! Wow, but no, the gameplay is just boring for me. I just did not care about the main objective, the necromancer fealt like a distraction and the zombies were a boring aspect. The way I describe that game is a boring first level D&D Dungeon crawl with a boring set of monsters that are augmented by an unbreachable (for all but one character) armor class and too much focus on encumbrance and where things are located. Wulfsburg made it worse too. Those tower tiles are just useless IMO, and why would they include two of them in the introductory mission? Why? I found the decision making to be boring, the monsters movement was overwhelming and the search function was lame as well. Why can't doors be closed? Maybe roll to see if the door still works and can be closed, but while a character is inside a closed room they cannot search? Not a game for me.

Game is beautiful and the theme pleases D&D fans. But the strategy needed in the game is zero. You attack or you search. The game gets repetitive and boring in the same match. I was playing with an open heart, but I did not like it. It can be a good request for extremely uncompromising players or for children.

RATING: 9
I Kickstarted this (and the first expansion) and got a zillion bonus items for it but even without all that I think this is easily the best version of Zombicide. The changes to the rules, the new setting and the trays to keep track of your characters all make this great. It's still Zombicide though and if you didn't like the first one I don't know that you would like this one (unless it was just the setting that turned you off). Again, like the first, I can definitely see some game design issues and it feels a bit simple for all the flash and artwork but it doesn't matter to me. Getting 6 people together to stomp around and work together staying alive against terrible odds just feels right with this game and I really always have fun playing it.

Easily my new favorite board game. I played it with my wife &  kids -- my 7-year-old daughter needed a bit of guidance, but picked up the basics quickly. And we all loved it. Our first game took a really long time as we felt out the rules, but everyone was eager to play again the very next day. The tense atmosphere created by ever-growing hordes of zombies makes it a nail-biter, and the satisfaction of watching your character improve through the game is great. The cooperative nature of the game is also a welcome change. Top marks!

Roll dice, one thousand million dice. You've got a variety of weapons to kill the dozens of plastic figures that fill the board. Each of them is a variation on dice rolling. If someone can explain to me how depth is created by rolling 3 dice needing 3's and more or 4 dice needing 4's, I will revisit.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I'm thinking that rating this game 10 is maybe too high, but then I don't see a reason why I shouldn't. I love cooperative games, I love fantasy, I sort of enjoy zombie games, depends on the game though. At first I bought this game to get some cooperative game for bigger amount of players and then when we played it for the first time, I was very surprised how everybody enjoyed that game and how we basical kept playing, playing and playing. I'm a huge DnD fan, and when this is not a really RPG we definetly got immersed in our characters and we really felt like we are being overrun by zombies. The rules were actually very easy to explain, the line of sight and zombie movement might have been a bit confusing but in coop game you really need only one person to understand that stuff.
Huge plus goes to the components. The player boards are amazing! Very high quality miniatures that make me to consider learning how to paint them. 9 very detailed tiles from both sides, the only thing is that they tend to bend a little.
I fell for this game so much, that I even started buying expansion, additional survivors and so on. So in the end I spend like 400 euros just for this and I dont regret it.

RATING: 9.5
Awesome Zombie slaying game with great mechanics and cooperative gaming!

For those saying it "could get repetitive"...you could play the same quest 100x and never get the same scenario. What spawns, where it spawns, items you find, etc etc change the game up so even if you played the same quest it's going to be different every time. 

Also, to comment on people talking about fatties not spawning with walkers, fatties take 2 damage. With the core box only, you have 1 starting equipment that can do 2 damage out of all 6 items. This means only 1 hero can take a fatty out. This means, should you split up to accomplish quests, that 5/6 of your party can't kill a fatty right away. This leads to some tense moments when the guy with the Hammer is across the map.

RATING: 5
This zombie chopfest is a bit better as solitaire, but proved tedious as a two player game, where my girlfriend and I had to handle three character a piece.  For a game that plays 1-6--and solitaire--it's frustrating that the scenarios are almost all balanced for six characters. This certainly makes it appear more like a wargame, BUT without the tactical complexity of a good wargame or the spaciousness of a good wargame or the scale of a good wargame.  The line of sight rules and the manner in which zombie groups split are equally annoying design elements.

Essentially, Zombicide: Black Plague is the 1980s Gauntlet video game with plastic toys: chop! chop! chop! run, run, run; chop! chop! chop! pick stuff up; chop! chop! chop!

I gave this thing away after two tedious two person games.

I suppose the theme, profusion of toys, and constant action make Zombicide popular in some circle--like this site--but why should I ever play this thing when Perdition's Mouth: Abyssal Rift is on my shelf?  Interesting maps, varied terrains, great characters, fantastic monsters, interesting wounds, great miniatures...basically, PM:AR is a similar experience to Z:BP, but with a TON of depth and EVERYTHING (including the maps and art) done better and with more originality.  And for fighting against a massive, overwhelming systems, there's the great solitaire wargame D-Day at Omaha Beach.  And for fun adventuring and far better fantasy battle mechanics, Runebound 3rd Edition is a winner.

Of all the co-op versus AI games we've played, this one definitely works the best. I'm not a zombie guy personally, but the theme works here and actually finds itself tied in pretty well in Black Plague. My only gripe is the game can drag on a bit for what it is, especially in the later scenarios.

Good game that varies depending on the team you are pitted up with. I really like the ability to make you feel like its a zombie invasion but also you don't get too overwhelmed until the later stages (usually) thanks to multiple fighting action during each turn and working in a group. When people decide not to work as a group or if your character has issues breaking doors as I was unfortunate enough to have in one game, it feels impossible. Still I've had a great deal of fun playing this game.

After two solo plays, Zombicide was much better than I had feared based off some negative reviews.  After playing a four player game, I am really happy with it as a relatively light, tactically pleasing co-op.  It really is reminiscent of Left 4 Dead in a box.  The downsides are the significant setup/breakdown time, being at the mercy of the deck whenever an Abomination comes out, and the occasional difficulties of administrating the game with strings of double spawns, Necromancer spawns, and the zombie A.I. system.  It's an extremely pleasing co-op dungeon crawler, but the aforementioned issues greatly decrease the likelihood of me ever playing the game within the listed game time of an hour or two.

RATING: 10
Amazing game.  Rules are unclear on a lot of things.  Had to make some house rules.  Other than that, it feels like an epic fantasy adventure, and has provided some of the most "cinematic" board game moments I've ever had!  The parts are top notch, with a ton of gorgeously crafted (and paintable) miniatures, beautiful tiles, and great box art. This game just oozes quality, and it's a good time for all.

I think I like this more than Zombicide.  It seemed cooler to just melee zombies instead of shoot them.  However, the Necromancer rules were confusing.

As a fan of the Left4Dead video games, I really enjoy Zombicide as it carries some of the same concepts. It's a fairly light game to play and explain but offers a lot of choices in the actual game. 

Much more streamlined than vanilla Zombicide + I prefer the fantasy setting. We prefer to play with some house rules that I used in vanilla Zombicide as well.

There are some new abilities for the survivors (like spellcaster), new items (mostly spells and armour, but some others that are basically variations of items from normal [thing=113924][/thing] and follow-ups), and a new type of enemy - the Necromancer, which can create havoc in the scenarios.

The ranged attack rules changed to a more common sense way (you can still do friendly fire, but only when you miss).

Yet, you will get the same walkers, runners, fatties and abomination, working in the same way. The scenarios, while more ingenious, are grounded in the spawn points, search and lots of killing.

The setting is more of my liking and allows for more liberty, specially regarding the use of magic (from both sides, with the presence of the Necromancer).

The minis are still pretty good, the game offers a lot of possibilities in building custom scenarios. But the game is, still, more an arcade game, with powerful characters killing hordes of foes, instead of a more grounded and immersive dungeon crawl with horror aspects. Lots of dice rolling and high degree of luck, with some room (not all that much) for strategy in movements and tatical approaches to combat.

In the end, if you like [thing=113924][/thing], I can see no reason why you wouldn't also enjoy [thing=137988][/thing]. If you don't liked [thing=113924][/thing], well, probably [thing=137988][/thing] won't change you opinion. For me, is good enough for occasional plays - no need to own it, nor would really miss it.

A bit disappointed. I did play all zombicide games, including season 1, 2, 3, all expansions and this one. Compare to the original urban theme, this medieval version is a bit like re-skin. 
The character abilities are not interesting as original one. 

The only thing I enjoyed is the wizard part.

RATING: 7.2
This is a fairly good game. It's been easy to teach and the gameplay is very smooth.  The added variety of different zombie types from various expansions helps keep it interesting but the continuous searching for dragon-bile and a torch can get a bit tedious. Despite the simplicity and randomness, it is still fun.

I don't think it's worth buying the retail edition at all, you only get 6 heroes and a very limited range of necromancers and abominations compared to the kickstarter edition. I'd only give the retail edition a score of 5.

RATING: 7
+ Simple to play
+ Cool figures

- The heroes feel samey at low level.
- No real campaign system, the game resets after each game.
- The game becomes easy once all the heroes reach orange/red levels (fixed with expansions).
- The abomination poses little real challenge (fixed with expansions).
- Expansions are needed very quickly.

I have not been interested in trying out a new ameritrash miniature game lately. Most of them feel unoriginal or have fiddly rules that are difficult to remember if you do not play the game enough. And I did not like the original Zombicide enough for purchase, as I found its ruleset lacking. And yet the Zombicide Green Horde Kickstarter inspired me to purchase Black Plague, because I like the original setting (human zombies) better, and heard that they improved upon the game system. And it does not disappoint! Of course it is still a relatively mindless dice chucker, but now the rules make more sense, and I still love that the enemy phase is really fast compared to more involved games like your typical dungeon crawler. There is no using cards or throwing dice for the zombies - you know exactly how they will act beforehand, and can get back to the heroes (who face seemingly impossible odds) all the sooner. Do not get me wrong - I still own some proper dungeon crawlers, but prefer this game if I want to play an entertaining, simple game with cool minis. Or Arcadia Quest, if I feel less like playing a pure co-op. The only (big) drawback of these games is that the box does not accomodate a quick setup and storing of its components - investing in a replacement insert is almost a necessity.

RATING: 7
Zombicide is a fun hack & slash co-op game that does away with the more nuanced strategy and deliberation of games like Pandemic or Robinson Crusoe and injects a shot of adrenaline instead. I like to think of it as a Resident Evil/Evil Dead simulator, a co-op game if Michael Bay decided to direct and design.

Components: The game components are CMON and that implies they are par excellence. The miniatures reek quality and are beautifully detailed. The map tiles are thick, well illustrated, mostly clear and atmospheric. There is a pleasant variety in terms of zombie molds and the weapons and spawn cards are excellent and unexceptional. The rule book is also adequate and accessible and contains 10 scenarios + tutorial. 

Ease of learning/teaching: The game is simple and once the basic mechanics are explained, the game prods along at a decent pace. As long as one person can take on the role of managing game mechanics, players do not have to deal with the complications of spawns and double spawns, necromancer spawns and zombie movement. I like it because this implies that I only need to explain 4 pages of the rule book to my group and can deal with the lion's share of complexity myself.

Theme: The setting is exciting and the events strongly encourage role playing, exaggerated hysteria, vocal exclamations of triumph and frustration; which is what I was really looking for in a game like this. While the character attributes 'encourage' class appropriate play (i.e. wizards should pick up books, warriors should wield shields and archers should be best with pointed projectiles), the paucity of class appropriate gear and failure of most classes to advance to levels 3 and 4 where their class attributes really shine, imply that one is mostly running hybrid classes. Which is just as well, because in the event of a Zombie apocalypse, one hardly expects the zombies to wait while protagonists gear up to expectations of nerd propriety.

Gameplay: The mechanics are streamlined and in the limited set of events, it's surprising how well the game engineers crises and flips situations around. While one is tempted to follow standard action RPG protocol to start massacring in order to level up, the zombies are stronger and will inevitably overwhelm heroes in a long game. And so smart play revolves around conservative defense, preparing for unforeseen zombie ambushes and focusing on tactical objectives. 

On the flip side, the game has no pretenses of any form of grand strategy. It's a tactical grind embellished with theatrical explosions (fueled by Dragon vomit).

In summation, I have thoroughly enjoyed Zombicide: Black Plague in both solo and multiplayer formats. The base game will quickly suffer from lack of adequate bling, encouraging acquisition of expansions, although to be honest, that's more a matter of fiscal discipline and enjoying what you have rather than what you could have. 
It creates ruckus and generates feelings of emotional exuberance and exhaustion around the table and leaves you talking about that time when character X gallantly jumped before an obese Zombie (creatively named "Fatty" in game parlance), blocked its blows with his shield and smashed his skull in with a hammer. Or failed to do all of that.

RATING: 3
Fiddly with lots of pieces, but ultimately boils down to rolling dice. The little amount of strategy required in addition to the ability to exploit the game system by constantly searching for items. Good game to house rule, but base rules are unengaging while still being too heavy for anyone to just jump in.

RATING: 8.5
A medieval, zombie-themed dungeon-crawl style game with beautiful miniatures and a simple combat system. The game's enemies have their own AI, so no need to designate one player as the "Game Master". As the mission progresses, characters gain XP and access to new skills, but it can be easy for one particularly deadly character to level more quickly than others, leaving everyone in a lurch when the scenario's difficulty scales to the highest leveled character. Unfortunately, there isn't a sense of progression once the game is over, as character stats do not carry over from one scenario to the next.

Definitely enjoyed this much more than base Zombicide.  Much more interesting gear to find and strategies to employ via the tunnels.  Thought the Necromancers added a very neat twist in see-sawing the rate of zombie deployments.   Still feeling it out, whether the rating will rise or fall after some more plays.  I don't really like the restriction of having to play 6 survivors.

RATING: 6
It has great artwork and the game play is pretty decent.  

Getting through the rules was a bit tedious and the game didn't really feel like it had enough strategy.  There's quite a bit of tactical play that is key to winning.  If you respond to threats incorrectly, you will be in trouble.  But learning that isn't too hard, and then after that it mostly just comes down to luck (in combat rolls, monster placement, and results from searching).  If you take out the tactical plays, there's fairly little strategy to the game.

I try not to fault a game in its ratings from being too expensive or difficult to find, but in this case, I have definitely lowered my rating a bit because of the high price tag.  I don't feel like there's enough in the box to warrant that price.

RATING: 8
I think this game is pretty good. The core mechanics are similar to Pandemic, as is usually the case in co-op games. There's a finite number of actions per character from an extensive list and a "good deck with some bad sprinkled in" and a "bad deck" and the game inches toward the climax by drawing cards from both decks. The diseases are zombies and instead of curing them you swing at them with your weapons using a simplistic dice-based combat system. There's also a noise system that guides the zombies based on what they are hearing.

I think what this game does extremely well is the fact that it rarely puts you in a completely bullshit situation where you just die without any way to fight back whereas in Pandemic it's extremely common to just draw a bad bunch of cards and get your ass handed to you in a single swoop of outbreaks. This can happen in Zombicide as well but usually it's preceded by a series of risky moves.

There's a lot of luck mechanics based on dice rolling and luck of the draw but these are mitigated by the fact that they have a very clear context. You don't know what you find when you search a room, you don't know where the zombies come from, you don't always succeed when you try to attack and so forth.

The star of this show has to be the gorgeous plastic minis and the extremely clear and well organized player boards. The game is extremely visually helpful and looks simply amazingly good on the table.

Behind all the visual goodness there's a solid game lurking underneath but the reason you'd want to have this game is definitely looks first and gameplay second.

There's unique content for probably 15 or so hours in this box and there's also a lot of additional stuff to augment the game with. The campaign is also very replayable and you don't have to do the stuff in order.

Easily a favourite of mine. Black Plague is a significant improvement over the original game, especially with the addition of plastic dashboards. These effectively make the inventory system less clunky and flimsy, enhancing the gameplay experience as a whole. I also believe the fantasy theme to be an improvement, if only because the zombie survival genre has grown kind of stale for me.

The best version of Zombicide I've played so far. The theme takes it to the next level and the components for player sheets make it a more streamlined experience and easier to keep track of what's going on with other players (especially when keeping track of new players, it's way easier for them to conceptualize the active items vs backpack when they don't get bumped around so easily).

A great, zany way to spend 3 hours with up to 12 people. It's a board game playground. The only gripe I have is that the difficulty is hard to set and maintain, even though I own all the tools to do so. It's a balance of "what do we play with to make this just hard enough".

This is a cool simple game. It has a lot of minis and I love how the character sheets are set up but...the game is soooo simple. The only downfall to this game in my opinion. Basically all you are doing is killing zombies....which is cool but it gets very repititious  very quickly. That being said it is very fun for what it is, if you are wanting a simple kill zombies game then look no further.

Back in the day, playing Heroquest, I used to dream of facing not only a couple of Skeletons and Zombies at a time, but hordes of them. Now I can! The system is nice to play and easy to explain, but the big problem is the game balance. It is clear that the designers did not pay much attention to this, and so whenever we win or lose, we never know if it was because of us or just a badly designed quest.

Review Date: May 2017

Disclaimer for context: I play every expansion and kickstarter 

Positives: Simple to learn. Great Co-op Game for those who like minis and killing a lot of zombies! Beautiful production of models. Took everything that was good in the original game and improved it and removed the bad rules 


Negatives: Can lead to alpha gamer syndrome if not playing solo. Can become surprisingly mathy for such an ameritrash game. You either win with no challenge or get completely annihilated, very little middle room which is where the flavour is. Horrendously long setup and take down time


Conclusion: Better than the orignal, but still prone to alpha gaming and being too mathy for its theme
 

Score 8....easy kill, easy kill, easy kill, loot, repeat, repeat...get horribly crushed or win without threat

HUGE Zombicide fan. I have all the original expansions, I paint my mini's, I've made my own heroes and had themed night... I mean I'M IN TO IT! When I heard about this expansion I was almost literally foaming at the mouth. It was a reboot, different, and best of all a fantasy dungeon crawler feel. Well turns out it was worth the wait. I think Zombicide worked a lot of kinks out if the game by the time they released Rue Morgue.... and for some reason they started from scratch in all the wrong places.

What I loved:
- The new player boards are probably the best change they made. I hope they release these for the original, because they are amazing.
- The colored bases for the survivors is a small addition... but a VERY VERY welcome one.
- Players do not default to hitting friends with ranged weapons, instead, only missed rolls... this makes SO MUCH more sense.
- Armor rolls are cool. It's nice to have a CHANCE to not get bit.

What I didn't like:
- The necromancer is a cool concept but it's not figured out yet. You spend half the game chasing this guy around and it adds SOO MUCH time to a game that is already pretty long. Way too many of these cards.
- Fatties don't come with walkers, horrible change.
- The double spawn points. Not a bad card, but WAYYY too many. Go back to rolling dice for spawn points as in Rue Morgue if you want to add variation into the spawning.
- Weapons, just more of the same. They had a chance to completely revamp the weapon system and have only some characters be able to use certain types... or maybe draw from 1 or 2 of several different weapon decks based on class.. ect. ect. 

Bottom line... they did not embrace the dungeon crawler "D&D" feel they way I was hoping they would. It's just more of the same stuff and if you want to split hairs about the changes they made most of the major game mechanics they changed wasn't for the better. Plus, all the stuff I liked I can add/house rule to my vast Original Zombicide Collection. Expect those player dashers..... God those things are nice!

It doesn't seem like there's enough actions to really do anything. I didn't much care for the tutorial mission with 2p, but playing the first quest solo was actually quite a bit of fun as I was able to squeeze out a victory on the last turn before I got swallowed up by hordes of zombies coming from every direction. It is a bit tedious to go through all the enemies in order and make sure all the things are moving in the directions they're are supposed to.

This hasn't seen the table since my purchase of Food Chain Magnate. I've  slowed my spending and I'm trying to play all my goodies of days past, but now my Kickstarter rewards are starting to trickle in. It's still one of my favorites to whip out in a jif (lots of setup but there's some technique to doing it quickly, and I think I've got my own way down fairly well).

1-6p Co-op. Might be fun to retheme, but so many minicards. Maybe they could be printed doublesided...

Guillotine games/CMON made a lot of great improvements in the latest version of the zombicide franchise. I just prefer the more modern theme of the prior games.

The gameplay here is equally as fun as the original Zombicide, but I prefer the contemporary theme of the original. I appreciate the tweaks to the system in Black Plague only in how it makes the game feel slightly different. Highlights were the Double Spawn Cards, and Necromancer Spawn Cards. Tons of fun.

This game surprised me. It took what was broken about regular Zombicide and fixed it. Black Plague is a great co-op ameritrash. Bloodthirstry Nun FTW!

Lots of zombies. Simplistic game. It's rather repetitive. You just take turns to smash zombies, there's not much to it. Although I generally prefer fantasy settings, I think the original setting for Zombicide was more appropriate.

Beautiful, simple to pick up, feels narrative

Negative: Necromancers can kind of kill the scenario. House-ruled to a random spell they cast instead of simply running away. No possibility of a real campaign as characters level up too fast.

Due to the theme of the game I like this slightly better than the original Zombicide, however I'm still not really a big fan of the series.

Cleans up the Zombicide rule set a bit, ends up being more fun. Roll dice, kill zombies!

A fun co-op game. Certainly not the best game, and I feel it doesn't scale down to less players well. Very engaging.

Very nice and casual, even girls like it - so a very good entry point for everyone. Fells a bit dull after a few games, so expansions are heavily recommended to improve the experience. Long set up for the casual game though - my feel is that you spend like 50% for the set up and re-setup of the scenario.

Excellent game, wish there were more scenarios built into the rule book.

This game keeps coming back to the table. I've owned it for several months now and it is a weekly guest. There is a bit of a learning curve for the strategy that doesn't quite keep up with the game's difficulty. Luckily, house rules can balance the game.

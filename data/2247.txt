A fast and furious game of fighter combat and bombing campaigns. Has some similarities to Up Front and Attack Sub.
Great quick game of dog fights, which are great filler or warm up on game day.

Would rate higher save for the rule book which is not always clear. Errata addresses questions and contains important updates. I have yet to play the campaign game as well so this rating is for the very fun dogfight system only!

Also have Hellcats and Corsairs.

Will play anytime, anywhere!

This is the first of my old games that i opened again after 14 years. It is a PTO aerial combat game where you fly attacks against flattops, dogfight and bomb Midway or Pearl Harbor.

Because i only play solo nowadays and it includes a solo Pearl Harbor campaign played on the Japanese side i read through the 2 rulebooks. But, for the solo game you do only need a very tiny portion of the rules and it has not much to do with the game itself. You draw a few cards and resolve bombing of the targets. After that you add up victory points. The other campaigns with the full rules are not suitable for solo play at all, because you have lots of hidden cards and stuff going on. 

Good 2 player game but absolutely not recommended for solo play. 

Old collection.

This is a very good light wargame. Those that complain of the card play making it random probably are not card players. It is not simply reacting to your opponents play but thinking ahead and deciding when to play and when to hold back a card. I would guess a good card player will beat a non card player most of the time. Keep in mind the best pilot could be surprised from behind and shot down.

RATING: 5.5
An innovative, ambitious high level concept and system, but the more I play it, the more its shortcomings become apparent vs the history. 

I've enjoyed many dogfights with my sons when they were younger, and played a few campaigns, and appreciate the game's different look, mechanics, and short play time.

However, I find myself chafing more and more over its vanilla flavor, and lack of critical differentiation between aircraft.  My pet rock case in point -- 

Wildcats vs. Zeros; 

The Zero gets better efficiency ratings, and is an agile aircraft, and can't take much damage; fair enough.  But most of my reading states that Wildcats, when using the correct tactics (don't dogfight in close, "zoom and boom" from high altitude, take a shot, then outdive the Zero to avoid getting one on your tail) could often be the equal or better than Zeros.  


But the system in no way allows for the Wildcat to outdive the Zero -- in effect, escape a Tailing situation; they both dive at the same rate.  (and for that matter, the Zero's superior climb isn't depicted either).  Both planes change all altitudes at the same rate, and thus this crucial facet in how they fought each other is missing.

Most US pilots also said the 6 50 cal machine guns had much more punch than the Zero's cannon/machine gun suite.  This was an imporant diffentiator, especially in Pacific war tactics, where the Thach weave led to predominantly head on shots between planes, which was to the more heavily armed Wildcat's advantage.  

But none of that here; same burst rates, and no simple special accomodation such as "one extra hit per burst" for Wildcat, or similar.  Seems a lot of aircraft nuances could have easily been folded in.

So both the Wildcat's advantages are absent from the system.  

I'm sure this could all be debated, and equally sure 100 other aircraft differences between all the planes depicted in the DIF series are equally absent. 

My other gripe, which is probably due to my ignorance.  Why in the world would you ever have your wingman do anything else but go after the enemy's lead plane?  If you go after his wingman, you give him the opportunity to pull wingman defense cards and shoot you.  Ignore him, and the enemy wingman is neutralized your whole turn!  Am I missing something in the rules?  Use your wingman to make the enemy lead burn a few cards, then have your leader gang up next to fight the now depleted enemy lead.

Isn't the enemy wingman supposed to keep YOUR wingman off his lead?  The I Go You Go sequencing is particularly chaffing here, in what is obviously the most "simultaneous" of "simultaneous movement" combat activity you can get.  The "passive" wingman is relegated to staring at the active wingman as long as he moves --  with impunity --  on the enemy lead?  Etc, etc, etc.  Poorly thought out wingman rules.

How can the enemy wingman ever help protect his lead you Your turn?  I haven't found it yet, and find this highly frustrating. 

Last -- yeah, and beyond those mechanics, even if they were ironed out in the system, half the game is Pure Fking Luck on the card draws.  I'm tailing an enemy plane.  I have five cards.  And none of them are burst cards.  So, for that 15 seconds (whatever), I can't shoot the enemy -- just wait until his next hand, for him to try to maneuver out of it.  WTF?  Another case of needing a simple "Avoid DumbshiX Situation" mechanic of say, in a Tailing position, you can cash in any two cards for a two burst shot, or similar Sanity Check rule, to avoid this absurdity situation -- which occurs periodically, I am sad to say. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
An okay aerial combat simulation card game, but it feels too constrained based on luck of the draw and can play slowly as a result of this luck (see below).  Since movement and attack cards are mixed within a common draw deck, you can get stuck with a hand of useless cards for several rounds, especially if you have a plane with zero burst that needs to maneuver in order to get bursts for attacking.  I spent 1/3 of a game with my hand full of un-usable attack cards.  The game would not have dragged out for so long if there were some dual purpose cards that allowed move or attack.

Great topic, I love WW2 pacific air combat. Card game with everything you need in the box. No blind booster packs needed!  Rules are a little cloudy in some areas and it can get a little too complex when you start adding more then a couple of planes to a side. This game has a good variety of planes, especially once combined with Corsairs & Hellcats!

Excellent game system, DiF is easy to learn, fun to play, and takes little time to resolve a dogfight, even with multiple aircraft involved.  Campaigns can be quite a bit longer, while adding little to the complexity of the game, and are where the real meat of the game lies.

RATING: 4
Ahh, we're back to the crappy planes again. With the lousy power ratings on the early war planes, DiF goes from being hugely random to a complete crap shoot IMHO. It's still a system that is neat and flavorful, but wildly over-complicated and opaque to the novice. When GMT says "accessible", what they mean is "accessible to wargamers", which means somthing rather different to me. A fun game which has some appeal, and so I kept my copy of Zero! when I sold off RotL and 8AF, but it has never really been able to get enough traction with me to get it any significant play. 2003 update: Zero! is gone now too :)

RATING: 8
Improves just enough on Rise of the Luftwaffe to earn a higher rating.  I think it's really a mistake on GMT's part to market/package the Down In Flames games in such a manner that makes the game appear like a serious, "hardcore" wargame when it's really a fairly simple card game that could have a much broader appeal.  Zero (and the other games in the series) really hit a nice compromise between simulation and fun gameplay-there's enough historical theme and specificity to give the game atmosphere and grounding but the actual mechanics are very light and exciting.  There is a nice sense of actually fighting a dogfight with the card-countercard system and there's plenty of drama and tension- particularly when you're on the ropes and hoping to pull off a half loop to get out of a jam, Zeros blasting your tail.  I haven't tried the campaign games yet, but as a 20-30 minute card game Zero scores well enough on its own.  Another plus- the game can easily be purchased for under $20, just about anywhere.  Of course, you'll want to get Corsairs and Hellcats with it, which isn't so cheap.

Very fun NON-collectible card game of WWII fighter and bomber combat. Its light and being a card game you can expect some luck. Both the groups I play in like this game. Good for 2-8 players, best with 4 or 6. You can play single combats or campaigns. Perhaps I should deduct one for this being a expansion but its still as much fun as the original even though it doesn't add much other than new planes.

RATING: 7
The biggest problem with Zero! is that relatively even matchups are hard to come by - the Zero! (in the game - I&#039;m told that it was not this way in fact) dominates the F4F Hellcat but tends to lose to the Hurricane IIb.  The only &quot;fair&quot; fighter matchup is, in my opinion, the Oscar versus the Buffalo - when what people are really going to want to play is the carrier campaigns, which are all Zeroes versus Hellcats (obviously, with bombers thrown into the mix).

I can't figure out what to rate this so I'll just leave a comment.  This (and C&H) has the coolest campaign system I've seen.  The different targets, the resource management, the limited special powers you pick for each mission.  Absolutely cool.  An 8, say.  But the actual plane on plane dogfighting is just brain-dead stupid.  I can't look at the cards without weeping.  A 2, easy.  So it is worth getting this game for the campaigns, but you need to find a dogfighting game to apply them to.  I'm working on smooshing together Blue Max and Whistling Death for the sole purpose of playing these campaigns.

Good game.  We quickly skimmed through the rules for a dogfight...so we probably got a few wrong.  But enjoyed playing it.  Plays quickly.  It reminds me of Up Front.  The campaigns look interesting.  I'd like to give them a shot sometime.  Rating is a 7 but could probably go up w/more plays.

[Verssen] Fun fun fast fast game of WWII dogfights. Underappreciated: the ratings are tarnished by folks who probably like long fiddly games instead of furious hand-management card duels.
 
It is a simple, easy-to-learn card game that echoes Up Front but in the skies! Clever design in that diving and flying low earns you extra draws, and climbing into the thin air stalls you out with less draws. 
 
Dogfights are a blast, and the campaign game is fast-and-furious! Highly recommeded.

RATING: 5
Rating based on 3 dogfights to iron out the play sequence and general feel of the game.  This is not Air Force or anything remotely like a serious simulation.  This is a card management game with a huge random component.  The impact of the wingman is such that good draws are key.  It feels like you are going through the motions because there is very little control over what you can actually do.  Going up and down to draw cards and hope for a way out when you're being tailed could be construed like a tactic but it really is just trying to "top deck" the right cards.  I will try the campaigns to see the bombers in action because I think that the serious fun must lie in seeing a larger picture evolve out of the fast exchanges which do not feel like combat but more like a dressed up game of War (the card game).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Update:  Raised my rating up twice, from a 7 to an 8 to a 9.  Ok, I'll call it a 10.  I enjoy this system and am impressed with all the different aircraft you can fly.  Dif reminds me of Up Front, in that once you grasp the rules the game gets better and better.  It also shares with Up Front the fact that it's a very unique system, and it takes more than glancing at the rule book to get it all working.  Wingmen, bombers and campaigns all use unique rules that you need to pay attention to.  I love the hand management aspect of the game and the way cards represent energy and options.  Best with more than one element per side, as altitude positioning becomes more interesting.

Nice WWII air combat card game!  The rules are kind of wordy and take some time to get through but in the end it's pretty simple.  It's just klunky that wingmen have different rules in most cases than leader aircraft and this makes for more head scratching when learning.  Once I 'got' it, I really liked the way wingmen work.  Somehow this game 'feels' like dogfighting to me and moves faster than driving around a flat table in Wings of War (with so many boring non-event game turns).  I have yet to try the campaign system, but you get a lot of game for the money.  I like the detail and artwork for all the different aircraft types.  You can find any aircraft you would wish to fly.

The concept of fighting an air combat using cards to counter each others actions is quite interesting, not to mention the Leader-Wingman rules work rather well.

A scenario/battle can be played in under 30 minutes, while a campaign will easily fit in one afternoon.  Anti-Aircraft and bombing/torpedoing rules also work well.  The designers did an awesome job of fitting everything on the cards, which are used to resolve everything!

The "Corsairs and Hellcats" expansion is more expensive then this game, which makes no sense.

BTW, Zero is missing 4 "Full Throttle" cards, which are included in the expansion (or you can order them directly from GMT).

Dogfight game where you are only allowed to do a maneuver if you have that card.  Therefore, luck will determine victor more often than ability.

RATING: 3
I didn't get past the dogfights (a subsequent detailed description from an experienced player of how a typical campaign plays out didn't encourage me to continue).  The DiF stuff is defintely not for me -- play seemed too repetitive, predictable and lengthy (lengthy for what it is, a spruced-up card management game).  I probably wasn't the right audience for this.  Update: my complete set of DiF (with all C3i material) has been sold.

An abstracted but portable and very fun simulation of air combat in the Pacific. This game has been in my top five for nearly twenty years, and when played with additions such as Ricart's house rules, is even better. Really hope GMT reissues it as a sequel to Wild Blue Yonder, as my cards are getting very worn and dog-eared...

RATING: 8
More stuff of a great system.  I gave ROTL a 9, Zero gets an 8.  I think the reason is that the carrier ops are a little too abstract.  Otherwise, this is a solid game with the usual resource decisions thrown in.  It is a game of wild action, especially when you have Devastators and Dauntlasses trying to get through the Zeros and flak!

A very good card-based, WWII dogfight game.  The mechanics work well and it's very replayable.  Solitaire works well too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rules look clean, but as written seem overly fussy (early 1980s style rulebook format is fine for games like Squad Leader and Wilderness War, but make a simple game like this seem harder than it is). In game play, things tend to move along until you come to odd rule exceptions - which can be remembered for future play. Graphics are decent, but not inspired - GMT's standard clean computer artwork works well for small counters but isn't quite as satisfying for larger aircraft cards. A bit fiddly at first (but not clunky) but gets much smoother with repeated play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun little game.  Dogfights are just a way to learn the game.  The campaign adds significant meat to the game.  Works well in teams.  Rules are rather poorly written.  My gaming group does home-made WWII games in which the strategic movement of units is area movement on some sort of home-made map.  Tactical battles are done with Squad Leader rules.  Next time we are adding in Down in Flames rules for air combats.  Should work very well.

Card driven WWII air combat game. Reasonable graphics, ok game play, very simple. Since it is cards it is portable vs. wings of war for example.

RATING: 6
Card game on the air war over the Pacific.  Intense dogfight is simulated but my group think the system is a bit boring and unrealistic, because of the notion that the planes' action is somehow constrained by the limited cards per se in one hand (you have deck reshuffling at the end of the last action card, but still you get the sense).  As a game, it is all too fun to have in an afternoon.  One of the bonus (and the real selling point) of the game is that you can play solitaire in the bombing of Pearl Harbour, recreating the movies (both the old and the new)in one short session.  There are a total of 6 campaigns in a game (Pearl Harbour is one of them and for solitaire only), allowing you to track the rise and the fall of Japanese Imperial Air Force.  The meat of the game is in the campaign.  You can really get a sense of accomplishment when you finish a campaign.  Card production is top notch with all the plane aerial view from the top and cockpits inside.  Ace pilots also influence the combat results to a certain extent.  The game is rich in historical information about the planes and the campaigns, if not the most realistic simulation on the market.  The matching of cards to respond to your opponent does, if only generally, convey the sense of tight manouver between 2 planes.  The notion that your action is controlled by the notion of luck (i.e. drawing of your cards in your hand) would not make sense to someone. But after all, this is a more game-oriented production.  If you are serious about air combat simulation, check out Clash of Arms "Achtung Spitfire" or Avalon Hill "Air Force" and its expansion "Dauntless".  Zero! is the volume 3 in the Down in Flame card game series.  The 1st volume is The Rise of the Luftwaffe (with Germans on the show) and the 2nd one is Eighth Air Force (Americans over Europe).

The dogfights are pretty bland, with many moves being obvious.  Always thought the greatest promise here lay in the campaign.  Unfortunately, the campaigns here are fairly bland, and incredibly, still have the balance problems they had in Rise of the Luftwaffe.  If they haven't fixed them now...

RATING: 7
Quick & fun, a great filler game for wargamers.  Well, the dogfight version, anyway.  I haven't played it campaign style and don't know if I ever will since I'd have to be convinced that the simplicity of the cards translates well into a bigger format. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The dogfight game is fun but very light, relying (as far as I can see) very heavily on the luck of the card draw.  I find the wingman rules counter-intuitive. 

This particular installment suffers from a lack of decent fighter match-ups.

Perhaps the campaigns give a bit more point to the highly abstracted dogfighting?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Zero! has way too many rules for such a simple game. It is essentially luck of the draw, but with some strategic thinking, you can affect the outcome.  The actual performance of the aircraft were obviously well considered and this adds a lot to those with great interest in the subject matter.

01/21/07 Played three very small dogfight scenarios (2 fighters vs 2 fighters). It was OK. I'd play it again, but I don't know that I'd ask to play it. I would never play the campaigns, ace pilots, or most of the chrome they threw in the box. I prefer something simple. The small hand size means luck plays a huge factor. I did like the wingman concept. And I know GMT loves to adhere to the martial theme, but if I'd been the developer I would never have put words like "Performance" on the cards and expect a new player to have to remember that means hand size. Ditto "Horsepower" means card draw limit. Etc., etc., etc.

I'm not really a big fan of the theme but if you're looking for a dogfight game I would recommend this one.  I haven't tried any of the scenarios just the 2 on 2 dogfights between the US & Japanese; it played quick enough to keep my interest and really boils down to a tactical hand-management game.

Volume III in the Down In Flames series.  Covers the first 6 months of the Pacific War during WWII.  Includes the early war fighters & bombers of Japan, Great Britain and the USA.

Bought this, still sealed, for a mere $10.00 (about £6 at the exchange rate at the time) from the superb Compleat Strategist during a trip to New York!

Similar to Rise of the Luftwaffe BUT easily available and CHEAP!

Rating for Basic Game: A beer and pretzels game of dogfighting WWII planes. Players draft planes of varying points values (depending on capabilities of aircraft). Each airplane has a hand limit, card draw and attack card value which affects what players can do with card. Damage planes have weaker values.

Players then use a hand of cards (attack, manuevere, etc) to to either damage or destroy opposing aircraft over 6 turns. Good fun, plays quickly and has lots of options for team games, controlling multiple elements of fighters, etc.

The luck of the draw is annoying at times but the game plays so quick as to mitigate that anyway. There are some clever mechanics like a wingman having a 'mini-hand' to attack/defend. The simple system elegantly recreates dogfights. Scenarios add historical play value.

I have only played half of the game now (haven't played any campaign yet), but dogfights are nice though. More players make the game more fun.

I think it's a good design, but none of my friends wanted to play it anymore after trying it, so what's the use in keeping it?

Sold.

Dog fights are best played on the computer. But when you're looking for a simple card (war)game, grab it.

Oh what fun!  I just wish this were a WWI airplane game, as my interests lean much more towards the aces of the first great war.  Having said that, I must compare it to Wings of War: Famous Aces (et al), and Zero! comes out favourably in nearly every way.  I've found that in playing Wings of War, I'm watching the board and seeing cards; in Zero! I'm watching the cards and seeing the dogfight, in my head, in vivid detail.  And Zero! has so much more replayability, not to mention its nifty solo-play Pearl Harbour Campaign.  Historical value just adds to the game's overall feel.  Great stuff from GMT.  Kudos, guys!

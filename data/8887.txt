We played this game (my friend has it) about 10 years ago, and I still remember the fun we had with it. I'd like to get a copy of it. Only thing I didnt like was that the units are not identified. The terrain features (grain silo, etc.) were really nice.

A really good medium complexity simulation  of the battle for the city...could be a candidate for the very first 'chit pull' wargame...

RATING: 7.5
A John Hill design I am keen to try, even more than Red Barricades. Interesting game system where one side continues to move/fight until a reaction chit is pulled or a 6 rolled on combat, then the other side gets a go.

After initial play seems intriguing. An early prototype of the impulse/activation type game, but due to being hex based rather than an area movement game it feels quite odd at first. Fortunately played immediately after TP:Stalingrad, so as the Russians had some idea of where I need to set up and defend. Lots of exceptions for various unit types and terrain, so takes a few plays to maximise capabilities.

RATING: 7

Excalibre edition. Not great 'history' but probably par for the course in that regard when it was first published in 1980. Once past that, however, it's an interesting, fun game to play.

Excalibre version. Superb model of Stalingrad fight on a tactical level. Assymetrical sides, which forces players to plan differently. Germans are strong in terms of organization capabilities, Soviets are masters of defense. But I cannot find the way to win as a German. Tough nut to crack.

I think this is under-rated for the mechanics, although it's years since I played it, and even then it was solitaire.  Fascinating system of repeated German attacks, with breakthrough points, and unpredictable Russian reactions by drawing chits.  Possible that it's not much of a game though - after the first 'week' (one turn) it gets pretty seriously bogged down.  Just like the real thing, I know, but still a bit of a drag... then again, quite a few wargames are like that, aren't they?!

Probably the best game on the subject with a few house rules. SOS 3rd Ed. while beautiful it is just too tedious and time-consuming. If you are going to fight an attrition battle only have it take 6-9 hours. Would rate it higher had Excalibur actually incorporated the previous games errata.:(
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I really enjoyed this, but could see an action oriented wargamer getting very bored if he were playing the Russians.  They rarely attack, focusing on maximized placement to do most of their damage.  Think of the Russian position as more of a puzzle, while the Germans are aggressively on the offense.  The Germans need to make every attack count too, as they must clear most of Stalingrad to achieve a victory.  This would be a good one for solo play.

RATING: 6
Good to have this venerable John Hill/SPI title see the light of day again and Don Johnson has provided good service in providing lots of extras.  Not my favorite mid-sized game on the battle (that goes to TAHGC's TURNING POINT: STALINGRAD) but this is still fun nonetheless.  The unusual sequence of play takes a lot of getting used to, especially for the Soviet who has to often sit idly by while the Germans romp on his defenses!

An interesting mechanic where the German player moves until a Russian response is triggered. The Germans have a relatively small number of infantry and armor units and a horde of artillery. There is some maneuver early in the game, but the Russians are forced to the Volga fairly early and rarely have more than two or three hexes of depth to their defensive position. Most Russian artillery is integrated into the other units although there is a significant number on the opposite bank of the Volga. I have not played the game since 1984 so I do not recall many other details of its play. I did not feel the single scale worked for the battle as the early stages were so different from the grind of the middle period of the battle.

Really gets the feel of the problems facing both sides.  CRT is incredibly bloody, and the activation rules ensure that both sides have to PLAN every turn very carefully.  If you just wade in with either side, a capable opponent will smack the daylights out of you.  Fun, tense, and interesting to the last turn!

John Hill is renowed for Squad Leader fame.  The subject on Stalingrad is a haunting dream on me.  I love to chase after every game on the battle.  But with limited time, this has to be delayed.  The Hobby Japn edition cover uses one of the 3W Wargamer magainze cover done by Roger MacGowan on the same subject.  Don't mix them up.  Excalibre is going to reprint this game soon.  The game arrives in Sep 2011 after 2 years of pledge.

Caveat: I'm not normally very interested in Stalingrad games, since I consider it one of history's really stupid battles. This one seemed to be one of the best.

Rather surprising since I tend to like John Hill's games, but this was one of the more gamey wargame experiences I've had. Like an abstract optimisation problem a hundred times over, with the emphasis on "abstract". I can see why he did what he did, and there's a lot of clever stuff in there, especially given the age of the game, but I think that's partly the problem - the age is masked by the fine graphics and the unusual mechanisms, but it still peeks through. I got little feeling of the decisions from the historical battle; throwing battalions into the grinder in anonymous stacks since unit integrity plays no role after setup left me cold.

Was a big factor of Paulus losing that he didn't take the Mamayev Kurgan immediately, which provided the mystic energy to move the sluggish Russians at twice the rate?  Did the Germans really conduct "thunder run" style penetration exercises because they knew which parts of the city had no Russians in them?  Why am I spending a lot of time sorting out German units by tiny division IDs when any organisation is completely ignored from the get-go and it's all just about mixing stacks from the right abstract ingredients?  

Overall, while not terrible, a surprising disappointment, complex, slow, gamey. The articles that came with the Excalibre edition were actually a turnoff because they reinforced the impression that this is a system for tournament-style, , low level factor-counting optimizers (I didn't know one could even do that with a fire-based combat system).   "Always plan an attack on a fortified structure so that you have at least 5/6 of a chance to occupy it". Er, what? 

Now that I have a punched copy, may need to try this solo just to let the locations sink in a bit more, perhaps that will help.  Don't think the factor counting to get a competitive ftf game is for me; too artificial.

Probably has the best memories for me of SPIs glory days. My brother and I used to play this as teenagers, with constant commentary about how we were so close to winning. The turn impulse system always produced amazing outcomes for some reason, with units holding on by the skin of their teeth. One more attack this turn would take a major victory point hex, but the turn always ended!

An excellent game but probably above the upper end of the complexity level that I can handle. Would take 3 or 4 games to get this one down, and I just don't have that kind of time sadly. Regardless, I really enjoyed playing.

I know we are all wargamers, meaning we are generally over-educated, well read and not a little anal (like a lot anal; explain counter clipping to me!) but what are all the knocks against this game for having no unit designations on the counters?

This is a game about Stalingrad. Read Beevor or Craig. Units got chewed up into remnants or mobs shortly after they entered their first hard combat. They hardly functioned as whole higher formations. Both sides used battle groups to tailor make teams for certain tasks (the Germans excelled at this) that cut across unit hierarchy.

Indeed, with the free flowing emphasis on taking the city the game simulates the battle in a far better way then many other heavy handed games (the laborious Streets of Stalingrad comes to mind.) And while not a quick game, it is much shorter than others. Finally, the combat mechanism gives the Russian the feeling he is actually getting to do something during the long periods of defense.

I concur with an assessment that came before mine:

This may be the best game SPI ever produced.

The rules are quite lengthy and involved but they are very clear and detailed, leaving no t's uncrossed and offer a tremendous amount of chrome concerning the two sides capabilities and doctrines, their weapon systems and the peculiarities of this urban battle. The game provides the players with an incredible number of tactical options and decisions.

Comments refer to Six Angles versions.

-----

Components are fantastic - counters have retained the classic SPI look, but are graphically superior with the German units marked for historical formations.  Map is far superior to original.  Play aids were basically copies from SPI version (unless you can read Japanese) and the rules are just copies of the SPI version.

Gameplay actually moves pretty quickly but the pace is about 95% driven by the German player as Russian activations are random and determined by chit draw after German attacks.  A nice addition along the tactical lines - before each combat you must determine a combat type (normal, urprise or ambush) which can have modifiers for the attacker or defender.  The CRT is brutal but somehow just enough Russians reinforcements keep turning up in the city and just enough German replacements are gained to keep them intent on pushing into the city.

I'd say the replayability is above average, but you'll not want to play the same side over and over I'd think.

On the downside : 

1.  The Russian player may get pretty bored as you'll be pretty reactive (stressing movement over attack).  

2.  Counter flipping - as you activate units they are flipped to an activated side.  This is no issue for the Germans, but if the Russians do not activate many units during a turn, be prepared to do some heavy finger / tweezer work flipping stacks.

3.  Bad decisions are seemingly quickly punished and can result in some vast swings of fortune (this may be magnified by the game only being 7 turns long) as units are cut off or gutted in the urban setting.

Reduced to a 5 Rating.  Lots of good things in the game, but too much of a combat factor counting exercise that is vulnerable to min-maxing and hunting for just 'one more unit' to move into a new combat odds column.

Very interesting mechanisms with soviet counterattacks & unpredictable activations. Your best laid plan may suddenly stop after an attack and the building for the conquer of which so many of your men died is again occupied by the enemy. Ouch !
The task is very harsh for the Germans in the Campaign game. What a bloody hell ! Huge piles of dead counters.
My regrets : the game may be a little repetitive & the Soviet player is often very inactive.

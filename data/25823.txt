[ESP] Un entretenido filler cuyo defecto es la dependencia de la suerte en las cartas. De no ser así le habría puesto mejor nota.

RATING: 7
The pirates, once they've escaped, have to flee to Tortuga. Being poor navigators, they land on the other side of the island from their Pirate's Nest, so must walk down a jungle path, and cross a river via ferry along the way.

Takes a lot of the complaints about the original and does something to correct them; a hand limit, a break in the path, an in-game reason you won't be left behind. The different tempo works with the change in how cards are acquired to really make this one feel both familiar and different all at once.

Like it's predecessor, it's Candyland for adults.  I always play with the next 12 cards face-up variant and absolutely love this game.  

While it's got different rules for hand replenishment from Cartagena, I'm still not convinced that one is better than the other.  They're just different.  I'd happily play either one anytime.

The addition of the boat and the revised/alternate rules make this more interesting than Cartagena 1. The theme still makes no sense but the game is OK.

UPDATE: After more plays, I have to say I enjoy the "move your own piece back" of basic Cartagena much more than the "move your opponent's piece forward" mechanic of Cartagena 2. Still like the modular boards of C2, though, so we play this with C1 rules.

See my comments on Cartagena for this is pretty much the same game, though perhaps just a shade better as the presentation is much brighter and the slight tweak to the rules is an improvement.  I'm not convinced that having the boat in the middle of the track, rather than at the end, actually improves the game but you can always revert to the Cartagena layout easily enough and it does at least make a change.

A light racing game that continues to hang around in my collection. Play cards and move your pirates forward. Or, move opponent's pirate forward and draw cards. An interesting tension really. Certainly there's luck of the draw, but plenty of room for tactics as well. Feels akin to Jaipur the Racing Game.

I got this because of the balance fixes to the original Cartagena, but somehow the complexity added makes it less fun for me, and also harder to teach to non-gamers. Having to explain the boat moves on top of everything else makes this not great as a gateway game.

Based on 1 play with 2 players.  Does not work nearly as well for two players as the original Cartagena.  To get new cards, you advance an opponent's pirate.  With two players, you only have the one opponent.  I think it would work much better with more players, so that you could choose *which* opponent's pirate to advance.

More Cartagena goodness -- I know I don't need both Cart. 1 and 2, but I just can't help myself.  I think I prefer the original (though that may just be nostalgia), but I really enjoy the changes in this game too.  I especially like the gold-rimmed cards that force everyone to do a hand-check to reduce their hands to 7 cards - this can be a powerful tool if playing against someone who likes to maintain a large hand.  Also enjoy the boat in the center of the playing field which can force some difficult decisions.  Prettier board and icons than the original.  Great fun!

Reminded me of a roll-and-move. I get nervous wondering if my move will help someone more than it does me. My opponents are also nervous about me doing this ("Don't move the boat - it will help JP!!").

This is similar to the first game, but adds a couple new and different elements. You don't drop back to get cards, but instead move another player forward. There is also a boat that moves between the islands, piloted for free by the person with the most meeples on it. I actually prefer the original version; it just feels right to me and doesn't really need these additions. I believe I am in the minority, with this view, though.

RATING: N/A
A good, light and quite puzzly, hand management game. Our 3-player game took us 20-30 minutes from start to finish including the teaching time.

I enjoy the puzzley aspect of the game where you have to manage both the cards in hand and your pirates. The decision to choose to move your pirate or moving your opponent's pirate to stock up card into your hand is enjoyable.

At this point, I don't remember much about the original Cartagena but I feel like I enjoyed this one a little bit more. The aspect of when to move the boat to the 2nd island, moving it back to the first island to prepare for your next turn or simply letting your opponent moves the boat for you adds a layer of strategy and tactical play there, although minimal, in this version of the game

The cards are a little small, and the rule where all players must discard down to 7 cards when someone plays a gold-bordered card, I almost didn't care for that. Also, the part where when you have all your pirate members on the final nest, and requires an action to raise the jolly flag feels almost unnecessary addition to the game.

RATING: 7
A worthy sequel to the original, this game adds two major elements:
-you must move an opponent's piece FORWARD to get cards.
-there's a boat that now connects two separate islands.  The person with the most pirates on the boast is the captain, so moving the boat doesn't cost him/her an action, though it does for everyone else.
I just wish the cover wasn't so garshly cartoony.

Added level of strategy with the maneuvering of the boat between islands, and moving your opponent's pawn to get cards.  Rules are still simple, the game is short, and it's a good family game.  I think it deserves a higher rating than the 6 I see at this time.

Problem:  The cards are too small in both Cartagenas.

Fun, but a little different from "Cartagena".  In this one, you've already escaped the prison and you're in the longboat.  First, you have to cross Island #1, get in another longboat, use that to reach Island #2, cross that, and reach the Pirate's Nest before your opponent does.  I lost at my first game of it, but thought it was fun enough that I'd like to play it again sometime.  Changed my mind.  I like "Cartagena" better than "Cartagena II".  Giving the latter away to Goodwill.

RATING: 7
Removes some of the simplicity of the first version, which was some of its charm.  I do like it, but the flow is somewhat interrupted by the boat passage.  It seemed a LOT harder to play catch up -- our first game had one person completely done, and the rest of us had one guy at the finish.  I would guess we'll play Cart I a LOT more.

Xmas Gift 2010 (30/12/10). UPDATE: Wouldn't mind a play, it's that circumstances seem to preclude it. If I wish to get newbies in to the hobby, then I would play the original game - still luke warm to one day play, so rating 6 (6/1/12). UPDATE: Finally get around to this.  It does play sufficiently differently to the original, which is a good thing.  However, its not as ‘pure’ as the original, and there are rule aspects (e.g.: 7 card limit) that don’t make it as clean.  The idea of moving the pirates forward to get cards does make it more decision based, and you can end up not being able to move.  Its not a bad game, it was actually enjoyable, but not simply the type of game you would bring out for people to play (rating 6; 31 May 2014).  UPDATE: Unlikely to play as the base game is much better (and components placed in base box) (Rating: 5.215, Sept 16)

This plays very differently to the original! The boat in the middle of the game requires some tricky management, and the change to moving other people forward means you can attempt to make yourself the most attractive person to be moved forward. It feels familiar but you have to think totally differently. I like it.

If you like the first one this will be a no-brainer.  The play is similar but the new rules for advancing other players pawns flips the original Cartagena on it's head.  The break in the board/ferry rule is unique as well and can cause some headache regarding when to ship pirates across.  All in all a wonderful game, but ultimately for diehard Cartagena fans only.

The sequel to Cartagena is another light, fast, racing game, that introduces a river that must be crossed with a boat. The movement mechanics have changed slightly from the original, making mass movement of meeples even more furious and fast.

I also own Cartagena I, which I like a bit more than Cartagena II.    My main reason is purely subjective.  I like the purity of game play of the original race to the boat without intervening obstacles.  In Cartagena II there is the boat in the middle of the track.  Somewhat less subjectively, I prefer the rule for drawing cards from Cartagena I wherein you move your pieces backwards to draw cards.  In Cartagena II you move an opponent’s piece forward to draw cards.  While this can be good for casual and family games because you can give a last place player a tail wind, it can also lead to king making, and I also think this mechanism makes the game slightly less tactically interesting than Cartagena I.  Having said that, I’m still happy to play either version.

Feels like the original Cartagena with too many expansions crammed in.  Using the boat to split the path into two islands is neat, but had too many rules associated with it. Moving your opponent forward instead of moving yourself backwards to draw cards seemed like a good idea too, but we had two-player games lock up too often.  And the freebooter cards are just random screwage.

This game changes the importance of most features of the original.  In order to get cards, players must move other pirates forward instead of moving back.  It also adds the dynamic of the boat in the middle of the game.  This can increase the difficulty of the game.  I thought the orginal was simpler, and it will take a couple more plays to figure out how to best handle the changes.

Similar enough to the original that one can feel good about not owning both.  But if you already own it, it feels different enough that you can feel good about owning it.  So, a win-win situation.

I think I probably prefer the method of gaining cards in this version, as it makes the game go more quickly.  I also enjoy having the two different boards, which slows down the huge moves that can happen in the first game if people are not watching what they're doing.

Cartegena 2 has a group of pirates that must travel from one island to a town with their treasure.  You move over a ship that has limited capacity.  You move by playing cards that have symbols on the board.  You can get more cards by moving your opponents to spots with other players.  

The game is very light and often there are not so many interesting decisions.  However, it has mild strategy and can be fun.  Very family friendly, light filler game.  However, I find it a little boring now after a couple of plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As much fun as the original, if shorter. Instead of moving yourself back to draw cards, you must move your opponents up. Very different dynamic and requires much more thinking. Since the board is split up, you have to use actions sometimes to move the boat to travel between the two. Timing becomes even more of an issue. Shorter then the original too. I suppose you could piggyback the two games if you like a longer game.

RATING: 5
I can't believe I had this rated higher.  Mostly based on me winning.  As long as you can figure out how to maximize your cards, and not make a mistake in playing them, you will only win or lose based on the good old luck of the draw.

RATING: 6.5
Game in a Nutshell: Race your pirates to the nest by playing cards that match icons along the track and moving a piece to the next open spot. Leapfrog your way to victory.

Played as: 2,3,4,5 player

Pros: A fast game to teach as it has a real classic, simple premise. Plays relatively quick. Anyone who doesn't mind a simpler game should enjoy an occasional race as a filler. It also scales very well for 2-5 players so long as you don't mind the increased playtime as numbers go up.

Cons: The draw card mechanic where you move an opposing players character forward can cause the game to go into total chaos. Newer or casual players may make a move that will swing the game wildly. I think it's intended as a catchup mechanic but in execution, it ends up being over-powered. Unintentionally someone may hand someone a win that played in a way where they had no business being competitive. Or intentionally, it gives someone the power to really be an ass. More then an occasional play here and there could lead to quick burnout. The pirate theme is quickly lost in the abstract.

Other: I believe the spirit of the game is to be easy and light-hearted. If your audience understands that, or would prefer that, there's no reason this wouldn't be an enjoyable experience.

Best Use: A quick filler or some light family fun.

I always wondered what happened to the pirates after they escaped from the prison in Cartagena - now I know!  A worthy sequel to the original Cartagena with more of the same but with a few added twists to make it a different game.  Different mechanisms include the boat which you must move between the two islands, the gold-bordered cards which when played cause all hands of over 7 cards to reduce to 7 cards, and finally that to gain more cards you have to move your opponents pirates forward.  I'm happy to have both Cartagena games in my collection.

RATING: 5
Two slight changes to the game and a surprisingly different game emerges (not quite an Asimov style Class F effect for a Class A change, but still, more than I expected). Getting cards by moving opponents forward makes it a bit more chaotic for you as you don't know where your pirates will be - one of your pirates may have been moved by someone else to get cards. Having a ferry in between the 2 islands of boards, having to get your pirates on there and maybe having to use actions to move the ship and then get your pirates off it effectively provides a bit of a mid-game re-set because the first player off the boat provides leapfrog opportunities to those following. A catch-the-leader effect which isn't really wanted or needed. Also not preferred is the increased king-making nature of other players deciding to move you forward or an opponent to get cards. You want to be on the boat when it sails, but in turn order after the player who's sailing it. The ensuing reduction in control makes it less likeable than the original.

Can't really decide whether this is 6 or 7. For now it's six then. The rule I like is the one where you can only receive new cards by pushing other players forward.
The boat between adds some flavour but wasn't used correctly in our first game so it was somewhat the same whether it was there or not.

Strategies are possible but many things depend on other players.

(3 plays) Very pleasant game and an improvement over the first one.  Helping other pirates to move forward to gain more momentum is so much better.  Game is faster, doesn't feel as mean, and is a nice little lesson for the kids.  The boat in the middle is OK, and fortunately, you can just play the old way with the boat at the end if you want.

Jan 2015 - 6.5 - In this game you want to be first to move your pirates to their nest through card play. Probably the most important aspect of the game is hand management. Rules are simple and theme is fun theme, although very abstracted. As a result game is quite dry.

Como gosto muito do original Cartagena, esta segunda versão desiludiu-me bastante, na medida em que permite que se beneficie quem se deseja, sem que tal se trate de uma medida de combate ao líder. A arte não é tão agradável, o modular board não é tão versátil, nem os objectos são tão "piratescos"; a grande vantagem é ser mais rápido e ter agora cartas que controlam a dimensão da mão. Não é mau, mas não me atrai minimamente!

--Nov2009-- Not totally convinced this version is "better" than the original.  The mechanism of moving others forward (rather than oneself back) is interesting - and might end up as an equalizer if all players were equally familiar with the dynamics.  But it's very easy to misread the potential of a given set of pieces - and as a consequence, it worries me a bit that one might win simply because of the inattention of the other players.

Now that said, the other deltas are fine:  the ship-in-the-middle is cute and the necessity of "raising the flag" a fun tiebreaker.

RATING: 6
A fine game, but a bit less focused than the original. The boat movement is great, but the multiple actions makes the game a bit too forgiving -- it's hard to really trashinate the other players.

The gold bordered cards don't seem to have much effect either, but perhaps they are inclining us towards a certain style of play. I'll have to play it more to find out.

Playing time is just right at around 30 minutes.

Like the original, except:
- 2 islands, with boat that moves from one to the other (costs 1 action, but if you start turn with most or tied-for-most pirates, may move it immediately for free)
- max 3 pirates/color on boat at any time
- to get cards, move opponent's pirate forward, instead of moving your own backwards
- hand limit of 7 cards, checked ONLY when someone plays a gold-bordered card
- to win, must spend one additional action claiming the flag at the end of the track

After 1 play, 2er, I think I prefer the original. But need to try it again and with more players.

I like it but prefe the original for two reasons.  First, having to hop over using the boat didn't seem fun to me. It was actually slightly annoying.  Second, I give the orginal a bonus for being the new idea.  In other words, the original gets a bonus for being the original.

This is one of those ideal "gateway games" that can be enjoyed by both newbies and experienced gamers.  As such, I've purchased the game for 2 moderately serious gamers, and I hope that they've enjoyed it!  Just don't expect a very "piratey" game, since it falls just this side of the "abstract strategy" category.  (I have a feeling that I'm "quoting" too many words in this mini review.)  The box is small and portable, the components are functional, and the game is enjoyable.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7/10

On first running with two players, this doesn't have nearly the charm of the original Cartagena.  I'll try it again with more players and hope it fares better.  Update:  It works nicely for four players, where the fact that you have to choose which of your opponents you'll move forward to get cards gives it an undercurrent the two-player game doesn't have.

RATING: 6
For all it's production value compared with Cartagena I think the original as got the edge in simple playability.The new game is ok but your fate lies in the hands of others rather than yourself. Breaking the board up into 2 different sections connected by the row boat would work better if there was more room to maneuver before getting to the boat.Having played again, I definitely think your fate is in the hands of others, your pieces can be ignored by design or accident by all the other players, until it's too late for you to recover, then they can start to move your pieces. You need help to win this game and that's something I don't like.

A popular player or someone not so well known and therefore less likely to be nobbled will probably have the best chance of winning.

Tried as a 2-player, this is a lot better in my opinion, much more tactical. As a 2 player I give it a 7 but as a multi player only a 5 hence the overall 6 rating.

I like the original version quite a bit, but it has three problems:

1) There is no hand limit, which means that players can stockpile an arbitrarily high number of cards.

2) When a single symbol is completely covered, pawns can move the entire length of the track with a single card.

Note that #1 and #2 together support the annoying strategy whereby players can hoard a mountain of cards, wait for a particular symbol to be completely covered, and then sprint to the end of the track for the win.

3) Players (new players, especially) can be stuck in an endless non-progressing loop if their pawns lag too far behind.

To my pleasant surprise, Cartagena 2 fixes all three issues:

1) Gold-bordered cards force players to discard down to 7 cards.

2) Via the mid-track ferry, the pirate path has been broken into two distinct segments.

3) Since players move other players' pawns (rather than their own) to draw cards, it is rare for pawns to be left too far behind.

UPDATE:

After some additional plays, my opinion is that Cartagena II is a solid family game.  Most adults, however, prefer the anguish and brutality of the original.  It's simply not as painful to move someone else forward as it is to move yourself backwards.  Also, there's a fairness issue - moving a player forward a significant amount benefits only that player (often arbitrarily), whereas moving yourself backwards benefits everyone else equally.

SECOND UPDATE:

Nevermind my previous update.  The "move backward" mechanic in the original is great, but I'll never play Cartagena 1 again because of its many problems.  Cartagena 2 is the way to go.

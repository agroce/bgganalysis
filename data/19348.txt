A most unusual and fun game with fascinating mechanics and much depth.  Basically, it's another very good game from Martin Wallace and I think that this is one of his more original efforts.  There are some great ideas in there and yet it remains typically Wallacian: the scarce resource management, the balance between aggressive and constructive play, the different scoring mechanisms, the special order/chit pulls.

Funwise it's better than Age of Steam and maybe on a par with Struggle of Empires - though I think SoE is a better and deeper game.

One thing I know is - it's not a good idea to build too much next to where the Bulgars are going to come storming in.  They can be quite powerful and it is not easy to stop them - though players must make it hard for them to take out Constantinople.

Hey...and this is actually quite attractive as Warfrog games go!  I hope to play it many times in the future.

RATING: 9
Schizophrenic Euro-Wargame in which each player represents a family with interests in the Byzantine court and the Caliphate at the same time. Excellent choice for three players.High rating for the magnificient components and for multiplicity of strategies and treacherous cynicism Byzantine contained, (You can be the byzantine Admiral and at the same time let YOUR arab faction take Constantinople by sea!!  What a rascal!).

Interesting mechanic where each player plays both sides, very balanced.  Never any shortage of choices. A great game overall, but I still prefer Struggle of Empires which has a bit more theme. Clear rules that are relatively easy to teach.

Manual looks better than previous Warfrog efforts, but still could be organised much better. The game is actually reasonably simple, but there is information in the back of the rules that you need to understand the first few pages. The game itself is another Wallace winner. Loads of conflict in a quick package (3.5 hours including rules for our first game, less than two for subsequent games).

RATING: 6
A cross between a wargame and a Euro, but this one seems to play for me more like a Euro game, as all players play both sides. 

It has been mentioned already that "who ever did this in real life?"

victory is on points tally of how well you can balance your play for each side i.e. Arab/roman, and gain VP's.

The end result is mildly entertaining and very Euro-game. 

However I think the game is an example of Wallace trying to devise clever systems which actually detract from the theme and period.

Juego con una mecánica curiosa que no tenía del todo claro fuera de mi agrado. Hasta que lo probé, la verdad es que me gustó. Hay que mantener un equilibrio entre dos bandos que se enfrentan entre sí, hay que saber tomar decisiones a largo plazo, y a su vez controlar bastante al resto de jugadores. Muy estratégico, algo complejo pero muy gratifiacnte de jugar. No apto para no jugones.

Initial impressions: Nice twist that you control both forces (Arabs and Byzantines). You have complete freedom to choose your own path. Easy combat system. I like that between similar armies the result is unpredictable but if a large army attacks a small army/city it will always win. The game also has a simple economy system.

RATING: 7.5
I enjoyed my one play of Byzantium. Like many games, it's one that would benefit from a second (and third play) relatively soon after the first. Decisions made early on the first turn have a huge effect on your position for the rest of the game, and its hard to know on a first play what exactly you are trying to achieve. I brought my two armies on almost randomly, for example, and that cost me later in the game when I realised how hard it was to move them. Theme a little clouded by the fact every plays two factions, one on both sides, but a good realisation of the events of the period.

RATING: 6
After one play, not quite sure whether I like this game a little bit or am essentially indifferent to it.  The enjoyment of the game is presumably in planning ahead and allocating your cubes to various parts of your board, and spending your cubes and money wisely to boost both victory point tracks at roughly even levels.  It seemed largely uninteresting, but there was clearly something there.  Maybe it was best to think of the whole thing as an abstract exercise?  It has a nice map and nice disks of purple and white.

It was a struggle to get through the rules.  I guess if you've never played a eurogame before, this might be fun, but I guess I just got a little bored with it.  The idea of playing both sides was interesting, but there was something about it that detracted from the fun as well... It seemed to make it all sort of pointless.  In the end, I guess I just didn't find it very fun.

Single play. This may have interesting mechanics, but it's got no soul. Unlike Liberte, the "sudden death" game (Constantinopole) seems restrictive ... if an Arab army did take Constantinopole, that would be one thing, but in fact the Bulgars are the bigger threat and that just makes a random element if one player decides to take 1VP for a chance of losing. (Which happened, and happened).
 Sold after my one game.

I played a 2 players game only. So, my rating could raise after a trying this one in a 3 or 4 players setup. This game is design to be played at 3 or 4 players. Don't try this one at 2 players... it is completely broken even with the end of turn variant for 2 players. The combat system where you make hits on a 4, 5 and 6 on die roll is not really convincing. We played with the combat system of Mare Nostrum but it doesn't make the game better with two.

Another classic Wallace game. Distilled strategy of a light wargame but an excellent economic game. Lots of interesting details in this diamond, like the "Hannibal" retreat rules, the fact that you forfeit your faction vps if they are less than half of the other faction vp's etc (brilliant mechanic!). Excellent game overall, without being too complex like other Wallace games. I loved too many different small details to list here.

Allocating the right amount of actions and cubes to either side is a tough balancing act.  Having too many troops devoted to the wrong army can be crippling. This actually makes poor die rolling more tolerable. At times I didn't mind losing troops for it eased my expenses and allowed me to reallocate my troops to the correct army.  Unfortunately, I played poorly during my one and only play.  

I do wish that there was a variable setup.  I bet that the opening moves become scripted for experienced players.

RATING: 5
On the plus side: 

1) excellent and attractive physical components (though I will always prefer cardboard counters to wooden cubes).

2) rule-book is better than average for Martin Wallace, looking quite spiffy in colour, and actually providing some examples.

3) a neglected theme receiving a bit of attention.

4) in terms of a "cube-management" game, it is both strategic & tactical.

5) it has a good "feel" to it, whatever that "feel" might be.

On the dark side of the coin:

1) it is not a history game, but a cube-management game that uses a slice of Byzantium to spice up things.  How historical is it?  Other than the ebb & flow of take, retake, lose, retake, raid, counter-raid, etc., there does not seem to be much in the way of history in action.

2) the combat resolution is to laugh, or cry, really, when it all comes down to rolling the dice.  The only thing taking combat above the level of RISK is the fact that both armies can hurt each other on the roll of the dice.

3) the Bulgarian threat to end the game by taking Constantinople is just wrong if we are dealing with a game set in the 7th century.  Raid, annoy, bug the bejabbers out of, threaten, rattle some sabres, etc., yes, but Constantinople fall?  Give me a big fat historical for-the-sake-of-all-that-is-dear break. Constantinople did not fall until the 1400's, long after virtually the rest of the Byzantine empire entered the dustbin of history.    GROAN!

RATING: 7.5
Played twice now (once three player, once four player) and I like it. It is, however, one of those games where I can fully understand why some people won't take to it. It is a bit fiddly as far as the cube and money management systems are concerned and it is pretty punishing on mistakes, particularly if committed early on. The sudden death endgame is a real threat and can be difficult to combat until players gain experience - I suspect experienced players will always beat newbies. Also, there is no getting away from the dice - personally I have no problem with this random element but I know some poeple will dismiss it as a dicefest - it isn't but I can understand why some will fume when their well thought out strategy collapses when they roll six ones. However, for me most of these cons are actually pluses - a game that will take quite a few playings before its subtleties are revealed. You certainly need to keep a close eye on the other players and there is a lot of info to process. For a game of such weight It does play relatively quickly though. A four player game shouldn't take more than two hours once a practice game is under the belt. My only criticism is that, while the themes are well observed and the two sides in the conflict behave quite differently,  I feel it lacks a little in the drama, momentum and atmosphere stakes (apart from when Constantinople comes under attack - nothing like the prospect of a sudden end to sharpen the senses!) Will be very interested to see how it plays with two.

Wallace mixes a wargame with a german game. The result is quite good. It is a conquest game, with a lot of interaction by conflict. Attacking is not disadvantaged, so much action.
Resource management is important and having two factions to be cared add angst to choices. My main concern is that, unlike my preferred Wallace games, Byzantium lacks that special sparkle.

Interesting game where players are controlling both sides in a conflict. When you keep the points in balance you score for both but if one has more than double the points of the other you only score the higher one. Cube management game with a lot of possibillities and a lot of traps to fall into. Very unforgiving of mistakes in the early game. Game plays in three periods which have a very distinct feel to them as the possibillity to score points shifts considerably between the periods. Need to play again soon.

I finally got this game to the table and it didn't disappoint. It has the typical early Martin Wallace design flavor. 

You are playing both sides of a war and the need to be balanced in the scoring for both sides along with an early game condition keeps the game interesting and engaging. It has hints of [thing=24181][/thing] or [thing=29937][/thing] where you are not playing the army represented on the board, but you are controlling it. 

The game seems fragile and will shine more with experienced players to keep things in a state of equilibrium. The dice can be torturous, but that said, it works fine and gives the game it's appeal.

Rules wise, the game is not difficult or complex, but implementing your plans can be perplexing for the uninitiated. If you enjoy Martin Wallace's designs, especially the earlier ones, then this title will not disappoint.

Great game for Wallace fans. This is very unique in its mechanics but the gist is basic resource management around the fall of the Byzantine Empire(theme). The game is mostly positioning and timing and works best with 3 players. The two player game needs some rule tweaks based on the pass mechanic and doesn't work as the rules are written. "If it's not Wallace it's Crap!"

A wonderful game that really shines with 4 players.  The strategies are not at all obvious at first blush, and the interactions among the many choices the players can make are subtle.  Nicely aggressive, a little bit cutthroat.

The rules aren't perfectly clear, however, and they do leave out a few cases that are relatively likely to occur.

Beautiful components, and a wonderful board that very clearly displays the players' options.  One of best I own.

Decent euro-wargame.  Fair level of interaction among players.  Army cubes sort of get recycled so players are encouraged to build forces and use them; two reasons to not carry over big armies between turns are (1) army upkeep costs gold and (2) you get half of your dead guys back into your cube pool (which is very useful).  There are few Byz. civil wars, use them wisely.  Final scoring encourages players to try to do equally well for both sides (Arabs & Byz.).  It's bad when multiple field armies of the same type (Arab or Byz.) move to the same side of the board because they will quickly run out of things to conquer.  The special rules have a huge effect on the game... ex. movement out of Constantinople is special, Byz. field armies cannot move into the desert, the Bulgars cannot attack via sea routes, and the game ends immediately (with special scoring) if Arabs sack Constantinople.  The emperor action can be very valuable.  Players can make the game go fast or slow... the best way to slow it down and wait for your opponents to commit their forces is for you to buy or play just one army per turn for a while.

Some people dislike the dice combat - I don't have a problem with that, when you plan an attack factor in your likely losses, or better bring an army big enough  that losses don't matter. This game rewards agressiveness which is refreshing, and it scales 2-4 fine, although the 2 player game has a minor problem with the end of turn (your opponent passes you get just ONE more action ...). Couple of things would have made it better - moving the Arab treasury so the cube pool was in the middle of the play mat & using thinner 'disks' - play this with clumsy players and the stacks get knocked flying.

 Even with 2, it was very good and I look forward to trying it with more. It's one of those classic Wallace games where players are faced with too many options and never enough time or money (cubes). Players need to balance multiple currencies as they try to advance their control of different areas while avoiding blocking themselves in. 

The basic gist of the game is players control two armies, Byzantium and Arab. Each player controls the same two types of armies and has different currencies for each. Byzantium armies can only take over Arab cities (not your own) and Arab armies can only take over Arab cites (not your own). Everyone can take over Persian cities. Taking over cities gives you VPs for Arab or Byzantium and controlling cities gives you cash at round end. The goal is to strike a balance so you get points for both at the end of the game (too much one way or the other and you only get points for the one that's in front). Even with two, the game gets crazy enough. I'm really looking forward to seeing how this changes with more players.

2-4 | (4) | 120 min | 12+ | Martin Wallace
Byzantium is another solid game from M. Wallace that has been overshadowed by his other, more successful titles. Some of its mechanisms are reminiscent of previous Wallace's games: area control and alternative ending conditions from Liberté, dice combat and tile selection from Struggle of Empires, interests in both sides of the conflict from PoR... The combination of all those features and its less trodden theme (nicely implemented by Wallace as usual) make for an interesting and enjoyable game where you fight against other players, not the system. I can picture myself getting a cheap or second hand copy if I find one.

Owned for years, but only played for the first time today (3/1/13), this is a pretty easy Martin Wallace title. The mechanics took me but 15 minutes to understand and I worked out a winning strategy pretty quickly. Played it 3 players and it seemed okay. It has the potential for a 2 against 1 beatdown. And the end game gets real slow due to analysis paralysis as everyone tries to figure out the most cost effective way to earn and deny VP. I wouldn't want to play it all the time, but certainly had fun with it last night.

Really spoiled by the strong option to rush for Constantinople before you fall too far behind and after 3 successive plays that way we concluded it was easier to stop someone one turn and then grab Constantinople yourself than to keep someone else out for the rest of the game. There may be a way to avoid this but after 3 successive disappointing plays we concluded that we could not see a more successful strategy so the game was always going to end up being played this way which is a shame as the play on the rest of the board was quite enjoyable.

While an imaginative game of the fall of the Byzantine Empire, Martin Wallace's rule-writing muse (which I've usually had a more favorable opinion of than others) has certainly deserted him this time.  Perhaps one of the worst cases of rules writing ever to come out of a Wallace pub.  Recommended, but until a definitive errata and explanation of legal cube moves is released, this will be a difficult one to put at the rating the mechanics truly deserve.

1 play (2p)--I like it. Plays quickly. Rules took a little work but not too bad. Strong sense of strategy. Although there is some euro-mini-maxing it doesn't seem to get in the way of my fun, falls more at the end of the game. Tactical choices take in mini-maxing but there are so many choices. Really like the smart & simple battles, the procession of sub-turns, the quick choices. Also like the army resource board, functionality, the "move" logistics. I need to try this with more players--probably changes it a lot.

It has that characteristic in common with many of his games, that it feels unpolished. Maybe part of it is Warfrog's components, I'm not sure. At any rate, I don't view it as a negative, just a distinctive characteristic.

The novel thing about Byzantium is obviously the ability to manipulate armies on both sides of the war. The multiple paths to victory are reminiscent of Liberte, but I think its emphasized much less here. The combat system works well and is kept nice and simple.

I'm looking forward to playing this again, but I wouldn't put it on the top tier of Wallace games.

RATING: 3
I dithered back and forth on what to rate this, but the bottom line is that I didn't care for it at all, and don't plan on ever playing it again.

Byzantium is basically a war oriented economic game. This sort of idea should be a familiar one to anyone who is familiar with Martin's previous games, and indeed, a lot of the stuff here seems to be recycled from earlier games. The special actions reminded me a bit of Way Out West, the constant combat of Tempus, and the economic tightness from pretty much any Wallace game you can name. Ok, well, most of those games are pretty good, what's the problem? The problem is that this game doesn't seem to have any heart. In Wallace's other combat heavy games there is some sort of hook which draws me in. In Struggle this is in the form of the special chits and the alliance system. In Tempus it is through card play and the neat action selection mechanism. In Way Out West the special actions are a little more interesting. Byzantium though, seems bland in comparison. Players represent both the Byzantine Empire and the Moors, but the two sides differ very little (as in, a couple of special actions are different, and the Byzantines are restricted from a tiny slice of the board) and the play just seems methodical to me. Players battle back and forth, attempt to take over territory, and gain as many VPs as possible. City scoring starts out lucrative, but by the end of the game everything is trashed and building cathedrals/mosques (a pricy method of VP generation) seems to be the only viable way to keep up with the Joneses. This all comes together feeling very scripted in spots. The Moors start out with more armies and very little territory, so they ravage their way into the Empire. Meanwhile, the orange fellows (a side harassment factor) attack the Empire in the north and there is some minor intrigue from within. Then the game settles down into combat for points for the rest of the way, with the end game, again, seemingly best dominated by church building.

I know it sounds like a lot is going on, but in reality it seemed to me that the average turn was just some guys attack some other guys, lay siege to their town, and lay waste to a city. Gain some points. Rinse and repeat for around 2 hours.

I highly recommend Tempus or Struggle over this title.

Thrift store find for £2.50.

Played twice as a two player game.

The rules are poorly written, and there is no index.

The game is quite fun and quick.

It is definitely a game rather than a conflict simulation, and will not satisfy grognards looking for anything more than  a shallow historical insight.

RATING: 7
A definite wargame with some Euro mechanics, Byzantium fits in nicely with titles like Wallenstein and Friedrich.  The theme is fairly rich with some nice historical chrome and there's plenty of room for interesting decisions throughout each turn- a typical Wallace design trait.  I really like games where you play two sides of a conflict (like Guerilla), and playing both the Byzanitines and Arabs (and the Bulgars too!) leads to some difficult choices.  The learning curve is a little steep and as usual for a Wallace game the resources are T-I-G-H-T- a good challenge for gamers looking for something more than the typical Euro game b***s***.  This is also the best looking Warfrog game to date- still not extraordinary, but better.  I was also impressed that I understand (roughly) how to play the game after just one read-through of the rules.  If you know Warfrog, that's nothing short of incredible.

Ok game. The problem with the game is that it is counterintuitive: it is difficult for new players to grasp the basics . This is aggravated by the length of the game (about three hours), which is more than a typical euro requires. Consequently, it is rarely played. I like the look and theme of the game. Once you have learned the basics it can be quite fun.

Byzantium is a weird game to play. It has what I think are typical Martin Wallace characteristics in the sense that it doesn't resemble any mainstream mechanisms; and it takes some real effort in figuring out what you must do to play the title succesfully. If you just 'muck about', the game doesn't cooperate and becomes rather boring and 'is that it?' You play [i]two[/i] sides of a conflict in Byzantian times and obtain points for both. If your highest score is over half the lower, only the highest counts, otherwise they are added. (If you went [i]huh?[/i] at that, then you've experienced the Martin Wallace touch.) 

The background in this game is the rise of the Arab empire, decline of the Persian one (which noone plays), and holding-on-to-things Byzantine empire. Money is invested in both sides in order to strengthen cities and attack them according to very simple rules. At the end of a full game turn, armies cost money to maintain so there is a tendency to run them into the ground just to save on costs, but on the other hand, building them up again costs a lot of money, and a lot of turns too. You are basically attempting to channel money as effectively and as efficiently as possible.

The game is indeed, as the rules make out, simple in that the mechanisms are fairly straightforward. There are a few nasty details because the two sides aren't quite the same, but all in all, once you've played a game, you'll have most of 'em pinned down. What is difficult is the strategy. I found out the hard way that you should not, under any circumstances, have Byzantian and Arab cities of yourself next to eachother. You gain points by attacking cities of other people, so [i]spread out[/i]! In addition, do not make the region of the Greek peninsula your hidey-hole, for other players will delight in kicking you out with the pesky Bulgars and gain Arab points to boot. Granted, all these things are in the designer's notes, but it is still gratifying to learn these on your own. I'm not quite sure about the 2P game yet, though. With 2 players, it is rather difficult to find cities to conquer—after all, there's but four armies running around on the map. Therefore you tend to use the civil war-option rather a lot, and this feels a little constraining. The game works better with 3 players, and things will proably really heat up with 4. What I like a lot less are the dice. They can make or break a campaign very easily. It's basically a 50% chance that you lose 1 unit of your armies per die thrown against you: easy to calculate, sure, but at times brutal. Not a member of the Dice Done Right Club™...

For now: lots of headscratching, being fairly sure there is more to things than meets the eye, and making another appointment with the empires of the Middle East around 650 AD.

[b]Update[/b]   I'm really not sure about this game; in large part caused by the fact that I just don't seem to get it, much less figure out what its main attraction is supposed to be. People claim cities, bicker about them,  get income, try not to pay too much wages at the end of a game round, and put each other under pressure with the sudden death option. Okay, I get that. But in practice...? Army boxed in? Too bad: lose points and/or a lot of money in order to get it to a better position. Special actions taken (in particular the civil war ones)? The board turns as syrupy as molasses as regular armies need to cover quite a bit of ground to reach an interesting spot. Attacking cities? It's of little use in attacking puny 1- and 2-token specimens, and attacking 3-token biggies sees your army dwindle to nothing in record time. Taking precautionary steps to defend your cities with a bit of levy? Smart move... unless noone attacks you. Oh, you want the Bulgars? Too bad, only two times per game turn and I just took them for the second time. Nothing really [i]happens[/i] in this game once the first turn is over. It's squabbling over a point here and a point there, trying to squeeze one more point from what feels like rather barren ground already. Does the game require such an elaborate ruleset then...? Downgraded by two points.

[b]Update 2[/b] I was able to find an interested buyer soon after I wrote the above, with the result that Byzantium has now found a better home.

Love the concept behind this game.  The idea of each player playing for both sides of the game is fabulous!  However, I am not a wargamer.

A resource management and a wargame wrapped together. Everything is twofold in this game: everyone controls 2 factions, has 2 scoring tracks, 2 different treasures, and 2 kinds of resources (money and cubes). Bet I will end up with split personality...

With a few plays under my belt, I have to say that I really like this game.  The back-door strategy of sacking Constantinople really excites me.

Update: Byzantium hit a wall in the form of a game buying glut.  In a half-dozen plays, Constantinople has fallen 5 times.  This has lead many in my group to question the game's mechanics.  This is supposed to be a back-door strategy, not an every game outcome.  I counter by saying that our defensive measures are simply inadequate to prevent this play.  However, I wonder.  I need a few more games to be sure if it's us or if the game is broken.

This was a real blast with 3 players.  What I've heard leads me to believe that it doesn't work quite as well with 4 -- maybe the map and/ or resources are too tight.  But it's a very cool hybrid Euro/ lite wargame for 3.

RATING: 8
After several plays, I can say I've enjoyed it. The mechanics are fairly unique, with each player having two scoring tracks, one for the Arabs and one for the Byzantines, that must be kept relatively close or else you'll lose points in the end.

Meanwhile, the cubes perform double duty as both an action selection mechanism and an army building technique, and the combat system prevents anything from ever becoming deterministic. Probably best with 4, but still decent with 3. You will need to play with an unofficial variant for a 2p game to work, however, as the pass mechanics as written don't work right for it.

Lots of tough choices, interesting mechanics and good theme, too. Thumbs up.

I like this game.

It's a Euro-wargame with player-versus-player battles but of a limited and attritional nature. 

The dice add a measure of luck but not usually overwhelmingly so.

The Bulgar factor must be carefully explained to first-time players otherwise the game can end quickly "by accident".

I like this game, or did I already say that?

RATING: 5
Players represent some power broker behind factions of both Byzantines and Arabs.  The object is to take actions over three turns, accumulating victory points for both factions, which are recorded separately.  Points for both factions are totalled at the end of the game, unless one faction does really poorly, or the Arabs take Constantinople (in which case only Arab points count).  Mechanics are take action/manage cubes/manage money - actions take cities, build forts and churches, and move/attack other cities.  All good, hearty stuff that brings in points and money, and smacks down the opponents.  Wallace does some awful stuff, but this is half decent.

I really like the mechanics, but parts of it are awkward and slow. The board develops slowly, leaving enough stability for good strategy and tactics. The Bulgars seem poorly balanced to me... they strike too fast & too randomly (either they end the game, or get mutilated, based on one dice roll).

liked setting.  gameplay didn't grab me.  played once.  I must play again and maybe again.
edit: played 3 times now.  3rd play the best; game coming out finally.  Isn't as thematic as I hoped.  Really wanted Crusades feeling, this feels more mechanical than thematic.  It's not bad.  I think Martin Wallace is obsessed with players playing all sides of a war.  In this case it works, but feels unnecessary maybe annoying.  Sometimes I just want to kill one side.  I'm liking this game more so maybe I'm wrong.
Played like 5 times now and it just doesn't seem special, yet always calls my name on my game shelf telling me how special it is. 
 I say "okay you better be good this time" 
I play it and as I box it up I say. "Come on Mr. Game, you have to be a little more interesting.  You have to feel a little bit like the Crusades and not be just about owning purple and white disc towers."

It didn't take long to realize that this one just wouldn't catch on in the groups I play with.  It's basically a war game where you play on both sides of the war at the same time (a mechanic that made no sense to me and didn't feel very thematic, either).

3-4 player euro/war game from Mr Wallace. Good game, works well with 3 since theres no need for serious alliances and a bit of stop him form winning will always be there. You play both sides of the conflict which is cool. Despite the rule book this is a relatively light game, that plays in under two hours even if it goes the full distance. Ultimately it boils down to getting the maximum returns out of your armies and resources in terms of more cash next turn and vps.

Played 2 4 player games, and won both. 2nd game I conquered the capital.

Game is unique in the way of scoring points. Each player controls both nations. Each player has to score points equally enough for the chance of winning. If one of your nation scoring value is twice as your other nation scoring value, you just score one and not both nations together. If that happens, you just lost the game.

When Martin Wallace's heart is in it, the result is usually a fascinating game. The same here: "Byzantium" is a challenging game that might have some concepts that need getting used to, but all in all this is an interesting wargame effort, in which no player plays a distinct side, everybody has a shot at great conquests all the time and representation of armies on the board in now way reflects the victor. As usual in Wallace games each player has only short action phases in which there are a lot of possibilities, and dice DO play a role, although not in a balance-damaging way (the combat system is elegant and simple). Very recommended and an unusual game in it's own right.

Unlike POTR, Byzantium has a more wargamey aspect, as players have to manage not just one, but two opposing armies and manoeuvre them on a point-to-point movement mapboard without getting entangled in one another. The logistics aspect is the challenging part - Wallace rightly describes the game as a cube management game. But the heavy aspect of cube management makes it feel a touch less exciting in gameplay than POTR.

RATING: 7
Very interesting play mechanics make a 2-3 hour wargame--of sorts. The wrinkle, you are able to control armies from both Arab (white) and Byzantine (purple) sides and your score is mostly the sum of the scores you get from both sides--if you keep your two scores in balance. You can also play the Yellow army (Burgars ?) as a spoiler.

Nice mechanic and game turn mechanism combined with an interesting upkeep cost make this a very interesting game.

A cut-throat and aggressive game forcing you to play two sides against each other.  Lots of difficult choices and options on every turn.

RATING: 8
This is a great, streamlined little wargame. From the economic aspect of managing cubes to the quick, clean combat resolution.  Not an ounce of fat on this game.  It's a great mix of planning and warfare (with plenty of conquest and not too much economics) and is my vote for the best euro-wargame mix.  I like it more that Friedrich, Perikles and Shogun.  I'm sure it's not for everyone so try before you buy, but I really love it. It gives you a nice wargame feel of pushing armies across a map and has some end game conditions and special actions that make it possible to land a lightning blow. It's a great option for a three or four player wargame (which is hard to find in a two hour format). Again, a nice game with a digestible level of rules.  It's got wooden bits and a Euro look but your turns are not limited by the game system like so many Euros- you can try some bold moves and go for broke when you wish (the Bulgar invasion).  I really like the back door strategy options in Martin Wallace games.  The board artwork and bits are great and the orange map and purple bits look nice together. Looks great on the table.

Note:
It may be a bit too abstract for many wargamers, at least that is the reaction I've seen from some of my friends.  Still, I really like the game and love its strategies.  It has a learning curve and that may put some people off.  One wargamer I played it with didn't care for it and said it had 'too many cubes'.

RATING: 4
There's some nice ideas here.  Playing both sides of a conflict is interesting and there is some nice tension between managing your cubes, points, and money.  It's ultimately a game of dice and multiplayer direct conflict, though.  So I'd only recommend it if you don't find anything inherently wrong with games of that type.

Strikes an engaging balance between economics, cube management, and maneuvering and conflict. Hints of Liberte with players controlling all parties of the struggle and a sudden-death victory condition with Constantinople.

This is a weird one. It is difficult to figure out what to do at the start of the game. I think I need to play it again before I can get a solid rating for it. As the game went on it became more clear how the game should be played and it also became more enjoyable.

Ok after 2 plays I think I can safely say that the game ends in one of two ways. Either the Bulgars take constantinople and the game ends short and whoever was able to lead the bulgars to victory will win. The other way the game ends is that it goes through all 3 turns. Both kind of suck. The game is much too long for what it is. I prefer longer games but this type of game is not really one I want to play for 3+ hours. There is little fun factor and I was mostly trying to play through it quickly so we could play something else.

Interesting dynamics, but likely won't play again without a lot of interest from other gamers.

I had trouble to rate this game. On one hand we have a decent gameplay, this nice dual scoring mechanism and some resource management, different strategies for victory are possible. This makes the game interesting. But on the other hand [b]rolling the dice[/b] to resolve fights [b]ruins the game[/b]. This huge luck factor is not appropriate for a game of its weight. Struggle of Empires has also dice rolling but resolving fights is more sophisticated.
Conclusion:
The game could get a rating between 7 and 8.
Stupid dice rolling makes lose it 2 to 3.
End rating 5.5 (as a compromise) but I  probably will not play again.

RATING: 7
Still need to figure this one out.
Rating based on one play AND with three people. 

SO I wouldn't count it as representative. 

It is fairly easy to close oneself up, so three words are most important here: position, position, position. 

Place your Arabs in such a way that they can attack Byzantine cities far away from your own. 
Take only the richest Persian cities. 

By turn 1 and a 1/2 decrease both your armies, maximise your income!

I think this game's very very tight, but if not played well, it may easily bog down. 

To be played again!

This is, by far, the least obtuse and cleanest Wallace design I've ever played (edit: after Steam). Granted it's still a bit obtuse (and overlong), but I'm surprised by how simple and enjoyable this is. Every game feels like the development of the Arab empire and the decline of the Byzantine one. Also works with two players, if you adopt the house rule that you may not pass if you have cubes left.

RATING: 6
By this stage in Warfrog's evolution, I think Martin Wallace was just inventing things that fell out of his head, and it was starting to show. This bizarre wargame, in which you play both sides was certainly original, but it doesn't really do enough to shine. It includes a little worker placement and little die rolling for 'hits'. Like most multi-player wargames it would work better with just 2 and save the frustration of feeling arbitrarily picked upon. Nothing very wrong here, but the chaos factor is high and there are so many better games to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An initial rating.

I like the mechanics, and they all fit together, but I just don't know what the best course of action is when playing the game.  However, I'd really like to explore the gamescape more fully and I'd hope that the rating would rise with more plays.

The one fly in the ointment so far is the Bulgars and the mechanic where they can sack Byzantium and end the game.  It just seems too easy and a bit of a distraction from the Arab/Byzantine conflict.  I'm sorely tempted to take them out of the game and try Byzantium a few times with just the Arabs heading for Byzantium.

It's a neat game up the usual high standard set by Martin Wallace.

The streak of Euro-Wargame hybrids I detest continues with this offering from Martin Wallace.  The game, like most in this sorry genre, is outright boring and way too methodical.  War is supposed to be chaotic and tactical, not dry and deterministic.  It also makes little to no sense why you control both armies on each side of the struggle.  Byzantium boils down to a calculation game of cube management that evokes not a even a smidgen of interest or daring.  It's way too by the numbers and entirely too 'meh.'

RATING: 7.5
A delightful game.  The design is elegant and simple, and provides the players with many interesting and meaningful choices.  Playing as both the Byzantium and Arab factions gives the "cube management" an Ikargura-like twist.  Overall, it was very solid.  I think there are a few minor areas of the game which could be improved.  It seems like armies are somewhat powerless in the late game against the tide of mosques and churches.  It would be nice if the mosques/churches were tied into the map in some way, or interacted more fully with the other factors in the game. The winner in our game scored the majority of his points on the second and third turn by investing his cubes in taxation and building mosques. He essentially didn't have an army.  It was somewhat frustrating to be able to raze his cities, but not his places of worship. :)  Overall though, this is an excellent game and is definitely worth a play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.9
(10/07) After a play and a half, I'm just not super impressed.  Generally I like playing all sides of a conflict, but in most other games (Gheos/Imperial) you have investment decisions in how much to support each side.

In Byzantium, I just never cared about the outcome of the conflict, even if I was involved.  If I lost, it lessened my financial burden, if I won, I gained some VP.  The dice definitely *helped* add some tension and enjoyment to the game, but it wasn't enough.

If you are interested in a Martin Wallace waro though, this one does have very approachable rules and a reasonably short playtime.  It also has reduced downtime due to short incremental turn actions.

In the end, I'd rather play Shogun.

RATING: 8
Byzantium is very well produced for a Warfrog game (the rule book is even in colour!) The game mechanics are more streamlined than previous Martin Wallace creations, but Byzantium is still a medium-heavy-weight game with tough decisions to be made throughout. It has many of the Warfrog trademarks including a strong theme and the use of dice (rather than the cards more typical of Eurogames) to add a certain element of chance. Byzantium has more wargame elements than PoTR or SoE, but these are still integrated into an overall framework that is closer to a Eurogame. After three plays, I still have some reservations about Byzantium (it can be unforgiving on players who make a mistake or overlook a situation) but my opinion of the game is improving with every play.

I wanted to like this.  I really did.  Poor rules explaination with lots of die rolling fiddly rules makes it lose a lot.  I can see a few things that could be tweaked to make it outstanding.

RATING: 8
I played this after Perikles, but I think its reputation for counterintuitive play and length are a little overdone.  This is definitely doable in 2 hours after the first play.  And, playing both sides was just not that confusing.  There are lots of nice little historical touches that make this a quintessential Wallace design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Like a Ming Vase, Byzantium is fragile yet beautiful. When handled with care by the right group of players, a wonderful strategic narrative unfolds over the course of the early-, mid-, and end-games.

The first time my group of three played it, the game shattered quickly into a million pieces. But we taped it back together again and had a great second play.

Byzantium is recommended for folks who like games like Imperial & King of Siam, and thus can avoid self-identifying too strongly with either of the factions on the board. However, be advised that there's quite a bit of luck involved. Bad luck isn't crippling, but very good luck can send the system spinning out of control. That said, the game would not be nearly as interesting without that dynamic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like several original concepts from here (e.g. you score 'Byzantinian' and 'Arabian' points separately, each player controlling his 'own' Byzantinian and Arabian armies, civil wars etc).  I don't mind that rules don't seem easy and intuitive at first.  That's the price for originality here.
 Everything seems to work fine, but somehow the game just didn't grab me so much to own it or at least to play it from time to time.  Having choice I'd rather be playing other Wallace's designs.

Another solid and interesting Wallace offering. Fantastic theming and sense of history as the Arab armies swarm across the ravaged Byzantine and Persian empires. Innovative gameplay and mechanics: As all players play both sides, it is always a kind of friendly feeling, though it is a game of conquest and plunder. 

Three negative aspects: 
(1) End of game rule doesn't work well with 2 players (To avoid this I used a house rule that you may not pass in a 2 player game unless you have used up your complete dice pool), 
(2) the combat resolution is pure luck (huge luck factor), when it all comes down to rolling the dice. This rolling the dice to resolve fights ruins the game. The only thing taking combat about the level of RISK is the fact that both armies can hurt each other on the roll of the dice (To avoid this I used a Mare Nostrum combat rules (sum the result of all the dices, and each 5 points, a loss causality), 
(3) It is way too easy for someone to use the Bulgars to attack Constantinople to end the game quickly (To avoid this I used a house rule that you add 2 cubes or zero cubes and attack).

RATING: 6

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It's a good game, perhaps underrated by most. It's very original, since players don't have to lead only one of the two sides of the conflict but through their actions they act both as Byzantines and Arabs, aiming to maximize both factions' scores. It has a wide replayability since every single action brings a different and unpredictable position on the game. This doesn't allow to have a fixed strategy line which is good since players have to "catch" opportunities to score points in a different way every time. I think it's only for expert players since there are a couple of dangerous moves to be definitely avoided since they may let a player win early because of the fall of Constantinople.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I don't know. This is a Martin Wallace game, so I should like it. It has neat ideas, elegant solutions, and feels good. Still... because of the limited movements, the game progresses too slowly. There are some moments, when it feels way too random. I don't know.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Well-crafted multi-player pseudo-wargame. Many interesting choices. Feels quite abstract despite the close graphical adherence to the theme - probably the lack of a well-defined role for the players contributes to this. The game is also surprisingly fiddly (especially the cube management part) - eg. for all actions, you take cubes from these places, except for this action cubes have to come from here, and for this other action cubes must be taken from here, etc.

The game features the (by now) well known cross-over feel we have come to associate with Martin Wallace: Abstract and eurogamish in its core, the game still allows players to build units and send them against the other players.

This again leads to a feature often found in this type of game where players face a seemingly arbitrary choice of which other player to attack. The one who looks like he's ahead? Or just an act of revenge against the one who attacked you last turn? Anyway, plenty of potential for whining by everyone involved and for decisions to be based on grudges rather than rational arguments. Not a feature I like in my games anymore!

Still, despite many similarities in feel, I would have to rate this one considerably higher than Struggle of Empires. Doesn't say a lot, of course, since I really dislike the latter game, but there you are. I can recommend Byzantium, but on the condition that one likes the multi-player wargame dynamics mentioned above.

This was an interesting game with some area control leading to victory points and revenue. You also get to play both sides of the Byzantines and the Arabs. You need to keep a balance of both. There is some element of randomness in which die rolling is used in the battles which could be annoying, but it is fun when it helps you. Overall the battles are based on strength so you have a good idea if you will win. I'm not a big fan of war games, but I liked this Euro wargame hybrid.

A lot of rules (a little fiddly), but I see lots of potential for this one. Its a Euro wargame, which means its more about managing resources than war. The whole army/levy/siege thing was a little hard to assimilate, but once you got it, the game played quite quickly.

And the Bulgars were a bit weird, in that they could cause the game to end early, leaving everyone feeling a bit unhappy after investing much time building up their army.

The game feels really good, but is clearly meant for at least three players possibly with some house rules for passing and Bulgars. Warfrog has set an enormous standard for their productions here; everything is of high quality and looks really beautiful. There seemed to be just some minor problems with gameplay, passing system almost ruins the game for two and the Bulgars seem to be too strong. Also, if the game plays to the very end despite of the Bulgars it might be boring in the end as the best way to acquire VPs will be building churches and mosques. Rules are long but it's worth reading and learning.

Decent block-management game with a war theme.  The separation of powers wasn't as interesting as I had thought, there being such little difference in Byzantine/Arab capabilities.  Without the player interaction of Wallace's better games, I doubt if this will have staying power; it certainly won't for me.  For a three-player conflict game, I greatly prefer End of the Triumvirate.

I wish the game was a bit longer, but it works well nonetheless.  A great resource management game, where for the first part of your turn its easy to forget how much money you're spending, then you realize you need to start keeping track of how much you'll need to keep up your cubes.  I wonder how this would work with 4 players with only 3 Arab cities to grab at the start? I find this stale-ing on my list because it is abstract and therefore harder to get people into it and explain a lot of little rules.

Very good and original, but under-appreciated cube-management strategy game in which you try to balance and maximise your victory points earned by the two rival empires during the war between the Byzantine Empire and the Muslim Caliphate. The unique twist in this game is that all players control both sides and need to earn victory points for both sides. Conflict is resolved very straigthforward by rolling a number of dice based on the strength of the attacking force/defence with a 50% chance on inflicting casualties. Nevertheless, the stronger opponent will usually win the battle and hence the impact of this dice rolling on the overall game play and strategy is not that huge. By the way, you'll want to recieve casualties, as you have to pay for the upkeep of your armies at the end of the round. Take in account that if the balancing act with the victory points really doesn't succeed, then there is always the option to sack Constantinople for a knock-out Arab victory ...

Nice atmosphere surrounding the game - even though the players, as they are playing either side can become a little frustrated as the mechanic to do this successfully isn't immediately understood.

I find this a tense and engaging effort that I have yet to completely decipher. Doesn't hit the table much, (sigh).

What a sweet, tight, solid, entertaining game. Another Wallace gets it right. Can be a bit difficult to understand what is going on at first, but instead of taking sides, you are influencing both in order for your interests to come out on top. The mechanics push historical-like events, almost like a wargame. Many many tough decisions, and an almost Knizia like scoring that forces you not to neglect one side for a higher score on the other. This one needs many more plays.

Nice game.  Very enjoyable to play and unique in its feel.  It has a very tight economy and tough, tough choices.  The battle system is _very_ bloody.  Militias are very important and very expensive.  In any case, I was very impressed.  Not my favorite Wallace game, but certainly it is very good.

The concept of playing both antogonists is intriguing and there certainly are many neat mechanisms.  The game itself just lacked that special spark that hooked me like Liberte did.  I would like a second play just to see if there was something I missed, but I doubt I will ever get another chance.

Played three-player games on 12/08/07, 01/26/08 & 02/28/09. Eh, I've played games by Martain Wallace that are better and ones that were worse. I think my main frustration during the game was often feeling that if I did anything it only made my situation worse. Either I would leave myself open to attack, or I'd run myself out of money doing something just to avoid passing. And passing left you open to being whacked and not being allowed to retaliate. So the first two games soon devolved into stagnant affairs where we were all guarding key cities with our armies, afraid to leave them. A three hour game of chicken. Result: chaos plus frustration equals boredom, a strange equation. In my third game early on I saw things heading in the same direction, so I threw the game (via the Bulgars) to end it early. It annoyed my opponents, but to me it saved me 2.5 more hours of slowly losing. I then lowered my rating from a 6 to a 5.

RATING: 6.5
Quite a good game I think, although I don't rave about it yet. I will play it more often and update my opinion here.
Update: still not raving about it. The ratio time spent vs. quality gameplay / or fun factor is too low. I am more critical with these longer games. Quite a number of randomness in the game as well. It is a game of points optimization and cube management. In the first round you seem to score the most points. The third round is important for a good position for the final scoring. During the second round no significant score was added. Nevertheless I ended up second, so these comments are not because I lost so badly.

Initial rating after 1 play with 3. Great looking Wallace game, first play triggered quite some rules questions, so have to play it again to give a proper rating. Which will then likely go up.

Very interesting game though, the "play for 2 sides" bit gives a special vibe to this game.

Essen '05.  Great-looking Wallace game, so of course it joins my collection.  Played a three player, and it was challenging, with no 'two vs one'.  A lot of choices, and we made lots of mistakes.  One other player liked it enough to want to purchase a copy, the third player lukewarm, as she was not sure what she was supposed to be doing much of the game, something Wallace games often have.

Nov '17- Remains one of my favored Wallace game, back from the time he made good stuff.

Brilliant design!  I ordinarily don't like games with combat; however, this game is clever and ties multiple elements together in an ingenious way.

Very different wargame from Wallace, where players control both sides of the conflict. While the mechanics are novel, there is a jarring feeling to playing the game; there is something in there that doesn't quite work. Plays fast for a wargame; that is pretty much the only reason why I would pick to play this instead of, say, Struggle or AoS.

RATING: 7.5
I love that each player is playing both the Arabs and Byzantine forces: these forces each have their own treasuries, armies and victory point totals.  At the end of the game if a player's lower score for one of the 2 forces is less than half of their higher score than they only score the points for their highest scoring force rather than adding them together. Play-wise the game is fairly straight-forward but there are some extremely difficult choices to make.  It really comes down to management of your actions (controlled by cubes), taking advantage of your positions and squeaking out a (fairly) balanced number of VPs for each of your forces.  After the first play I wasn't extremely pleased but over the couple of days that followed I kept thinking about the game, possible strategies, it's balance, etc. and it dawned on me that this was another fabulous Wallace design.  Would recommend playing with four.  UPDATE: subtracted 1/2 point as after the newness of the unique design wears off you see that it's really a very tactical game.  Perhaps too tactical.

Only played once solo and then not complete. Very Wallacian game ... both players play both Byzantines and Arabs and score on 2 different victory point tracks. Essentially a game of cube management where you need to decide whether to allocate cubes to field army, militia, movement, elite units etc. I'd realy like to try a proper game.

RATING: 6
I actually enjoyed my one play (well, technically two) of Byzantium, but I'm not sure I need to play it again. My enjoyment came primarily from aggressively exploiting Wallace's obtuse rules: [i]So there's a sudden death condition? Let's go for that. Now that I have a lead in Arab points, I can use the Bulgars to attack Constantinople for the win...after just fifteen minutes of playing?! LET'S DO IT![/i] I also have to admit that I got quite a kick out of seeing my advantageous position gradually diminished by my opponents, only to still win on a lucky roll of the dice at the last possible moment. Thrilling!

The problem with Byzantium is that, once everyone knows the rules, the sudden death antics are easily stopped, leaving behind little of interest. You can't let anyone get too big a lead in Arab points, so everyone should get an Arab city to start the game. If Arab parity fails (likely due to the luck of the dice), the fall of Constantinople is still pretty easy to prevent by taking a couple Special Actions. As long as everyone does some straightfoward due diligence in these areas, the game comes down to getting Byzantine points from grabbing cities and attacking other players' cities, which in turn comes down to a bunch of dice rolling. In other words, Risk.

That said, it seems like we got at least one significant rule wrong in our first play. I also think this could play differently at different player counts: with just two, I think this could be a quick but interesting duel, and with four, I can see more intriguing alliances emerging than what happened in our 3-player game. Thus, I'd hesitantly volunteer for another session of this, just to see what it was like.

Interesting game. There is a lot going on, and many paths to take. Must play a very balanced game. The downside is that it plays a bit long, and is highly prone to AP. The luck of the dice is a big factor as well. But besides that, a pretty cool wargame. For sure a game you cannot hate in one sitting, for if you do, you haven't played it enough times.

A totally underrated design by the great Wallace.  I'm still stunned how wargamers especially think his games are "lightly themed."  Instead of having chrome to your eyeballs, Wallaces focuses on gameplay and elegance first, THEN on theme, and after 3-4 hours with 4 players, you realize that you've played a loose model of the fall of Byzantium with asymmetrical powers, unique victory conditions, and nailbiting gameplay par excellence.

Committed AT-ers and literalist wargamers need not apply.

In the era of the Byzantine empire, players control Arab and Byzantine armies. One has to manage their money and forces for both, as your victory points will be the sum of both forces. In this cube management game, one selects actions to move, redistribute units, attack, control cities, or take special actions on the board. There is a chance for a sudden death Arab victory if the city of Constantinople falls. I'm not a wargamer, so my rating reflects the fact I am lukewarm on this game even though there are elements that are pretty good. The sudden death victory condition needs to be managed with experienced players, and when playing with someone for the first time they need to be warned about the possbilities of this happening. Because perception plays a role in this game, and whoever is perceived to be in the lead will be mercilessly attacked, I'm not a huge fan of this. There is also an element of luck with the dice as well. Not a bad effort by Martin Wallace. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice-looking Warfrog game (!!!) with a great premise and a substantial, but not unreasonable, amount of combat.  The simple, hit-or-miss battle system doesn't thrill me because there's nothing you can do to mitigate an unlucky streak, but that's not enough to keep me from liking the game because even the most high-rolling aggressor will run out of cubes eventually.  Also, in the meantime, there's a fair amount of other things to do besides fight, even if a few of those things are overpriced (Church/Mosque) or unappealing (Fleets, Tax).  The sudden death endgame is an interesting touch, and a good way for an unlucky player to perhaps pull off a surprise victory instead of pushing his or her armies to the limit for a shot at one paltry victory point (there's a fair amount of that towards the end of the game).  Byzantium pleases, but does not overwhelm.

a deeper game than I gave it credit.  It really is about resource management with a strong area control element to it.  The game and swing strongly from turn to turn, but this is in fact from the decisions that you have made.  Classic Martin Wallace game mechanics, such as a list of actions that you can take each turn, but you are limited in the number that you can take.  I would like to try this one again, as I feel I didn't fully grasp it the first time around.

Need to keep an eye on Constantinople to make sure it isn't taken by the Arabs, unless it would be in your favor. Best to just take as many areas as you can without concerning yourself with keeping too many. If you build units, you should use them, otherwise they are just a drain. Take the option to add disks to your cities, they are worth money and points, plus they help your city strength, while keeping these benefits from others.

Byzantium is a fascinating combination of cube management and war that works rather well. The system forces one to make tough decisions, you also need to take risks. Playing two sides at the same time is a wild idea that works. There is a lot of interaction between players and no downtime at all. Thematically this game is strong. The playtime is a bit over two hours (but there is a possibility for sudden death!), which is just about right. The rules are not as clear as they could be, but once you play the game you understand what it is all about.

A hybrid between wargame and Eurogame that's interesting and which changes in feel as the game develops, spreading out for the easy gains and then fighting out the consolidated positions.

Once explained it appears like a great game, but then we were all somewhat let down.

I love the abstract/historical simulation.  The art is exquisite–Peter Dennis's best work.  

I am not so crazy about the dice-resolved combat system.  Our three player game came down to a single roll at the end: the two other players were battling for Constantinople. If the city fell, the attacker would have won the game.  But the city stood, and I won the game by a comfortable margin.  Kind of silly for such a strategic game.

This is an odd beast and not an easy game to grasp right away. The rules don't help either. 

Players play both sides of a war and try to score as many points as possible with each of the armies. Final score will be the sum of both scores. It's confusing and tough to figure out in the beginning but there's a good game in here. The cube based economy is a good idea and it works well.

Ir's hard to get players to want to play this, though.

The question "What's the most efficient conversion of money/cubes into victory points?" will never leave your mind while playing, but there are so many options for doing so and so many opportunities for other players to interrupt your plans that this is still an excellent game.  The evocation of the Arab conquests and the wealthy but underprepared Byzantine Empire also works pretty well, and the fact that all players have the power and the incentive to manipulate both sides of the conflict created several interesting situations and decisions.

Completely unintuitive.  It took 1/3 of my only play so far to realize I was doing stupid things and another 1/3 to figure out how not to do it again.  The last 1/3 was spent realizing how much I'd messed up and trying not to play kingmaker.  Still, the veil of confusion feels lifted, and I'm eager to improve on my pitiful showing.

Regrettably, the next time I play this I'll probably have forgotten everything again.

An entertaining cross between a Eurogame and a mild wargame. (There are a few similarities to Phalanx's Alexander the Great.) The game is enjoyable and the turns are fairly tense.

RATING: 7
Another very good Wallace game from what I call his historical series. 
I consider Liberte, Perikles or Struggle of Empires better - this holds it own with these outstanding games.

It has some fascinating ideas.
The Arab/Byzantine sides are asymmetric. The Byzantines have money and position but the Arabs have the larger army, and the initial turn forces the Arabs to attack and conquer. 

The players don't really represent either side, but have to manage an army, money, and position for both. The players score is a combination of both the the Arab and Byzantine score. Combine with some limited civil war possibilities where you can attack other players position on the common side - you have a rich game with a lot of options. 

The Bulgars represent a wild card, prevents any area from being safe for the player trying to accumulate Byzantine points. If they successfully attack Constantinople (ahistorical, but works in the context of the game) it is a sudden death ending with the Byzantine points being worthless, provides yet another thing for the players to consider.

The game is attractive, I like the art on the map and the player mats, also thanks for using purple for the Byzantine pieces.

This is a beautiful game, but I wish the disks were thinner.  There is so much going on in this game for such simple rules.  You need to track money, cubes, special actions, relative placements of your two factions, where the Bulgars are, two sets of points and of course everything your opponents are doing.  There is very little player downtime with lots of action and strategy.  Great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
One play, four players.

PROS:
* Clever mechanisms -- players control all factions -- allow symmetric play (all players start off in the same position) on an asymmetric board. 
* Luck is somewhat mitigated by mechanisms that restrict who you could attack, and how often. This also limits the length of the game.

CONS:
* Mechanically illogical. I don't have a problem with controlling two factions. I do have a problem with the difference between supporting your attacking and defending armies. You have two pawns on the board, each pawn representing a faction. You may only attack with these pawns, and you support them (with ubiquitous cubes) individually. However, when you add support to a city (with more ubiquitous cubes), you are supporting ALL the cities you control equally -- it's like having one virtual army supporting all your cities simultaneously! This game would probably make more sense if it were rethemed to contemporary warfare, in which multinational corporations fund guerrilla armies or military coups. 

* As with many Wallace games, early mistakes not only cost you the game (which I don't mind), but give you little to do during the game. The only way to make money, and thereby supply your armies, is to take control of cities, which creates a rich-get-richer scenario.

Other comments
* This is a very simple, but counter-intuitive war game. Make sure you have someone explain you the rules well, especially the difference between supporting attacking and defending armies, as well as how income is generated.
* Luck did not seem to dominate as much as other reviewers noted. Because who and how often you attack is very restrictive, getting a good position seems more important than lucky dice rolls.

Based on watching, rather than playing, two games so far, both of which finished early with the Bulgars sacking Constantinople.  I'm really not sure about this one; remeniscent of Liberte, but with dice resolving conflict like Struggle of Empires, I worry that it might inherit the criticism that bad luck can hit a player too hard in a game of its weight.  But then I took three games to realise that Struggle is a masterpiece.

It seems like it really needs 3 or more players; I doubt I will ever play a two player game of it again.

Also, as a pet peeve, the thickness of the wooden discs is twice what they should be and I find it very annoying.  They get stacked too high and become too unstable, as well as block view of the board.  Landing on their side too easily, they roll away.  I'm in search for thinner discs or to cut these down.

RATING: 7
Excellent light wargame that plays well with 3 or 4.  The three turns each feel quite different - from easy point scoring by claiming cities in turn one, to desperate fights picked against key opponents to force a 2 point swing in turn 3. The mechanics restrict attack options so there is not too much whining. Rewards both planning and opportunism, but none-the-less has a fair dose of luck: especially in the crucial Bulgar siege of Constantinople. Feels like an extra round of development would have tightened it up a little.

You are at the same time a Byzantine noble AND an Arab sheik, you score points separately for the Byzantine and the Arab, but you have to balance the two factions so you can add the points together.

And there is much more going on.

An interesting ride with a very abstract feel to it.  As a result, really need to be in the right mood to play this (hence the 6 rating).  We did play 4 player, and I wonder if 3 player might be better.  Think it is a valid comment that this is a game that winds down not up as most points on the board are taken and folks cash in on the churches/mosques with a possible go for the prize at Constantinople.  But somehow, when facing a game of multiple actions and area control....In the Shadow of the Emperor scratches a lot of the same itch in a much richer game.

RATING: 6
One word:  Byzantine!

The big problem with this game is that you play both sides--but in real life no one did this, so it feels artificial from both an historical and a game playing point of view.  Who ARE the players suppposed to be representing?  So you end up attacking poeple for basically minor reasons.

That and a silly Bulgar rule  (though actually they were a constant threat to the lands west of Constantinople), their presence simply hands the game to a player who tries for the brass ring.

RATING: 6.5
feels very repetitive. Big problem IMO is the bulgarian-rule. Although i understand why it is there (to give players already beaten in VPs the chance to win through the backdoor; which is in principle a good idea) it is too much dependent on die rolls and luck. ONe lucky shot on byzanz is the victory ... No planning is necessary for that. Also, i cannot imagine that the bulgarians will ever attack without full strength (they hardly take any losses; and will build up fast anyway.)But with fixing the bulgarian rule, the big problem is the repetiveness of play: YOu move there a little bit, you conquer there a little bit, next turn you do the same ... no climax in the game

UPDATE: After many many years I came back to this one, and I must say, my critics was a bit too harsh. Some design mechanics are wonderful, for instance, that conquered cities are degraded by one. I raise my rating from 5 to 6,5

--Aug2007-- Only 16 months without a play - but finally got it to the table.  The game is somewhat typical Wallacian fare:  learning how to play mechanically is very different from having a clue about how the game should ideally progress.  Nonetheless, it's a nice clean system that can be picked up fairly quickly - even if one wallows in dithering indecision and self-recrimination for opportunities missed as play progresses.  It's got a bit of the flavour of Liberté (powerbroking, both symmetric and asymmetric victory conditions) which ain't a bad thing.  Rating might go up if I could play it more.

RATING: 9
Excellent. Very simple and clear what you're trying to do, with a bucket load of options each turn and every one of them useful in some way. Each turn flies by as players do one thing and then execute it quickly. You're not sitting twiddling your thumbs waiting because it's go go go. Yet, despite the simplicity, there's a good historical feel here. Nothing too deep, but it's all recognisable stuff from history, and in a nice, light, not getting too bogged down in the details way. Combat is kept simple - there's no modifiers for this or that - so the pace is hardly slowed down at all.

I had a blast playing this. I skimmed through the rules at super speed and yet walked into it with a decent understanding of how it worked - not necessarily how it all fit together so I could play well, but well enough to launch into a game and enjoy myself. Well written rules and a nice clean system make this game light, but a reminder of what games can be - fun. Looking forward to many more plays.

Finally played Byzantiunm. My interest in trying it had dropped off a lot from the initial excitement, and as such I haven't bothered to play it until now. As it turns out, I think I'm happy with that - I'm not a big fan of this game. It's not a bad game perse, but it's sort of fiddley and silly and I'm not too excited to play it enough to get good at it and like it better. With repeated plays, but rating would undoubtedly improve, however I don't expect the game would get more than a 7 from me - ever. The way I feel about it right now, 6 is pretty generous.

Отличная, самобытная игра. Безусловно продолжатель лучших традиций автора, первого этапа его игротворчества. Как и другие ранние работы Уоллеса, всё очень складно придумано, не без агрессивно-боевой составляющей. Однако аналога среди его же игр назвать не возьмусь. Здесь есть и стандартные фазы, и всего три игровых хода, и целый набор различных действий, но... всё это обернуто в оболочку баланса между развитием двух наций. При этом каждый игрок управляет обеими нациями.

RATING: 7
The battle rules are abstract, yet they work well. Playing both sides of the conflict is innovative though it takes some multi-tasking and detracts from the immersiveness of the game. Balancing the Arabs and Byzantines can be a bit of a pain-- scoring points can be bad! I like the theme and the cube management mechanics. As in other Martin Wallace games, there is a steep learning curve.

[BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Resource Management. Rating after one 3p game. Really like mechanics and the feel/flow of the game; playing and scoring for both Arabs and Byzantines is very interesting. Each of the three turns felt very different due to the resource flow and how tight everything gets after the initial land grab. Looking forward to more plays, suspect my rating will go up further.

Finally traded after not getting another play for several years. Kills me to get rid of a Wallace game, but I couldn't hang on to it.

Not a bad little wargame after you get the hang of the mechanics. Allows for some good back and forth play and combines resource choices for your armies that affect the outcome. Drawbacks? Probably the dice for those who hate luck; and the fact that taking Constantinople can get you victory (which I used to win).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Man, it is crazy trying to wrap your head around this initially.  The problem was that I couldn't figure out who I was and what I was doing.  The mechanics are quite good and the play is intriging, but I was searching for an identity when the game forces you out of one.  I finally put my finger on it.  I play a corrupt money launderer.  The moment I figured it out I had a blast!  There is so much going on in this, that it will make your head spin.  But, the game is solid.  

You have to make profits by pitting both sides against each other.  There are great elements taken from previous Warfrog gems whose familiarity is welcome in order to grasp how the rest of the game operates.  

The scoring is is wacky and wonderful. You can score for the Byzantines and for the Arabs but they are scored on two different tracks.  The points are added up but the catch is that if you score less than half in one country than in the other you don't get the lower points.  Wallace makes scoring the Arabs tougher so that it forces players to push the Arabs up quickly which nicely mimics history.  The biggest catch is that if Constantinople falls from either the Arabs invading or the Bulgar horde, then the game ends imediately and all Byzantine points are eliminated. Wallace has done his good work again.

I'm not a big Martin Wallace fan. Actually, his name on the box is usually a reason to steer clear, possibly playing somebody else's copy first. I bought Byzantium based on the description and looks alone. I had some fun playing it, but those typical Wallace 'features' (annoying imbalances, badly written rules, long playing time) have so for been a reason why I haven't played it again.

Will probably end up on the trade pile. Would like to play it once more before then, but I'm not sure whether that's going to happen.

Unique war game/eurogame hybrid in which each player controls an army on each side of the Arab/Byzantine conflict and tries to profit from both sides as best he can.  The rules are very simple but the strategy is anything but.  It's very easy to make a wrong move and get yourself overly committed in one way or another.  Definitely not for those who don't want to have to think much.  This is a hard-core gamer's game similar to Age of Steam in depth.  Good stuff.

While I enjoy this game, I think it has a certain limited amount of replayability. There seems to be one major "script" to each game leading to the winner, rather than multiple paths to victory.

Just another well-designed game of Mr. Wallace. More a cube-management game, than a war-game. The fights are fast, easy and quite predictable; it's a good one. It's very interesting, than you fight with the Arabs as a Byzantion, and with Byzant as an Arab, and collect victory points of each side - and sometimes in a civil war you beat an other player as Arab vs Arab... The rules could be seem a bit difficult, but they aren't - at half of the first turn you'll be a professional.

Can't wait to play. After visiting the city and learning some of the history in modern-day Istanbul, I ran out and bought a copy. I'll report after I play it.

Played my first play last weekend. It's an interesting game. One I'd like to revisit soon. It seems that if one player wants to take down Constantinople, he can fairly easily. It's the other players who should make things hard for any one player to go after Constantinople. In my game, I got ahead with Arab points and went for Constantinople. It worked out great. I won a quick game. None of those players would allow me to do it again if we all played another round.

I'll keep it in my collection to revisit it later. I don't see it ever making my top 10 or anything, but still a good game. It's a Wallace after all.

RATING: 3.5
First Impression:

What a mess. My first play through this was a rules fight. Partially because the host hadn't read them well, partially because the game is rather fiddly.

And why is the game fiddly?-Because it's highly thematic! Which would normally be a good thing, but in this game it doesn't matter! Since all players play doublebackstabbing nobles you can't really immerse yourself with the byzantine-arabic struggle.. Its outcome is rather unimportant for you. And the worst is that you're not doublebackstabbing your opponents, just the game. 

Oooook, what an experience.

RATING: 5
This game has some clever things going on -- playing both sides of the conflict, civil war actions, etc.  That said, the gameplay left me basically indifferent to the game.  I like wargames and I like medium to heavy euros, but I've yet to find a hybrid of the two genres that I really enjoy other than Shogun/Wallenstein.  So Byzantium, like End of the Triumvirate, Nexus Ops and others, just isn't quite what I'm looking for in a game.

It is so hard to figure out what to say about this game. It's not like anything else I have tried. And that is a very good thing. It also means it is very hard to find out what is the right thing to do when. And with a right restrictive game like this it also means there is very little room for trying different ideas out and thus the game has a rather steep learning curve. That said, I keep thinking about it so it definitely has some good qualities to it. I just haven't quite figured out how and why yet.

Whereas Struggle or Liberté combined theme & design perfectly well, I don't feel the same about Byzantium. The fact that you control both sides seems very abstract to me and I don't see what exactly it brings to this game or this specific historical period. I have the impression that the mechanism are original but don't really fit.
The Bulgarian attacks in the North are also very strange historically speaking. With a little luck, they might take Contantinople and I don't see any incentive for a Byzantine player to defend that region.

RATING: 3
Really strange game with very forced rules. It simply doesn't make sense that in every turn there can be three civil wars, or Bulgars attack twice. The connection between the Arab and Byzantine armies feels unnatural; as Arab you can attack every Byzantine city except the ones you own - as Byzantine. Why? What does that mean?
When playing I became most annoyed by the movement cubes: you must have them in order to move, when under attack you can sacrifice them but as attacker you can't. Bollocks.
The strangest thing is that you can build up a new army if the previous one has been devastated, which can pop up anywhere on the board. As if you can hide an army of 20.000, as if you can parachute an army.

Anyway, I played once and managed to get the Bulgars to conquer Constantinopel, therefore my Arabs (which were leading the VP-track) won. Yes, Arabs won because Bulgars conquered Constantinopel.

Conclusion: typical Wallace with overly complex rules for a ridiculous fake-simulation. Why not keep it simple a give players a clear overview of the actions going on?

Can't wait to play again.

RATING: 8
I'm surprised at how much I like it. The simulation of history is fascinating.  Although it's not clear who exactly the players are supposed to represent historically, the progression of the game nonetheless imitates history quite well, with the Arabs making heavy inroads into the Byzantine empire, and the Persian empire all but wiped out.  The end state of the game feels reasonable, and emphasizes the punitive nature of the conflict.  Playing both sides of the conflict works in a way that, really, it doesn't feel like it should, and that's truly wonderful.

Some of Wallace's wargames, such as [gameid=38309], are interesting, but ultimately flawed.  I enjoy those games as studies in game design, but not as enjoyable gameplay experiences.  A few of Wallace's simulations push me beyond detached interest and truly engage me.  Byzantium, like [gameid=9625], manages to achieve this transcendent state and become great as history lesson, great as game design, and great as experience.

An unusual game - both in terms of mechanics and overall conceptualization - that is ruined by the Bulgar end-game condition.  It's too tempting not to throw the Bulgars at Constantinople for the auto-win if given the chance, so it always ends up happening.

Also, at some point in the game, troop movement becomes overly limited.  Army pawns eventually get stuck within one or two spaces of wherever they happen to run out of steam.

Even given the problems listed above, I'd play a few more times.

The rules do suck in this one. 
Maybe I'll give it a second chance.

Martin Wallace. Great game.

RATING: N/A
Finally managed to play this after an initial aborted attempt. While we generally love Martin Wallace's games, Laurel and I just couldn't warm to this one. I think part of the problem is that it feels a little like a wargame, but we have loads of top quality wargames that make Byzantium seem a little weak in comparison.

another Wallace "Euro-Wargame"...this one is about managing two opposing forces and their income and expenses at the same time...dice battles, action selection and balancing two VP tracks control the stratagies...like many Wallace "Waros", there is also a shortcut to victory, if you can pull it off successfully...

If you can accept the premise and get through your first play (there's a definite learning curve), this is another solid Martin Wallace war-euro.

칸다미르와 더불어 수험기간에 산 유이한 게임!(현재로서는.. 아무튼 앞으로 더 사는 일은 없어야 한다. 도락을 잊어야지!) 마틴 월러스 게임 중에서 르네상스의 제후와 더불어 유이하게 땡기는 게임이었다. 사실 암사동에서 더 싼 가격에 구할 수도 있었겠지만, 이번 구매도 그런대로 저렴하기는 하다. 배송비가 천원 밖에는 안들었으니까. 이 게임은 칸다미르와는 다르게 상당히 전략을 요하는 녀석이다. 그래서 나름 기대가 된다. 워게임과 유로게임에 양발 다 걸쳐 있는 녀석이니까.

Never got to play this with experienced players. I like it, generally, but the situation with the Bulgars train-wrecked every game I played.

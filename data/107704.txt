A game of great potential which I definitely want to play again.
Pluses - very strong political game, quick and balanced battles, clear path to victory
Minuses - hard to recover, rich gets richer, too random events

En la primera partida de aproximación una cosa ha quedado nítida para todos los jugadores. Este juego no se puede jugar a 4. Hay 10 puntos en juego (Papa, Rey y 8 feudos). Si para ganar en solitario hacen falta 3, y en alianza 4, es muy fácil expandirse y llegar a esa cifra entre 4 jugadores. Por lo tanto a los 3-4 turnos ya se empieza a precipitar todo extremadamente rápido, lo cuál es un poco anticlimático pq cuando estás empezando a saborearlo, de repente se acaba sin poder evitarlo (demasiadas combinaciones para la victoria como para poder evitarlas todas). Además, si los 2 jugadores más fuertes se alían, tienen casi asegurada la victoria en alianza ya que los otros dos no podrán hacerles frente. 
   
Nos quedó claro a todos que son necesarios al menos 5 jugadores para una mayor competición e intriga por la victoria.

Por lo demás el juego dejó buenas impresiones y hay que dar más oportunidades para evaluarlo bien.

Very interesting game with emphasis on player interaction. This is a game of political intrigue, not a conflict simulation. You are very open and you can't win without cunning politics.
4 or less player leaves too much room on the board and play becomes erratic.
The rules are well and understandable written, but extremly unprecise on details. You want to have the FAQ along with it.

I dreamt to play the games Fief or Fief II since the eighties, but had only the occasion to play this edition in 2015....

Very nice design but the rules are quite complex and not adpated for too young children.

Very thematic medieval warfare/politics game. 

It is all that the Game of Thrones should have been! 

In my game, a notorious murderer, Duke Gauvin, became Bishop, then Cardinal and at the end Pope! 

Hope to play more.

Fief is a game simulating the leadership of a european kingdom in the middle ages.  Marriages, religion, warfare, all the meaningful stuff is there.  The game is originaly a 80's design (before we had to decide if a game is euro or ameritrash), but has been streamlined so it can be played in a more reasonnable timeframe (adding one victory point, that is, one title of pope, king or one fief, lengthens the game considerably).
Diplomacy is key here, and what the game has kept from it's 0's rules is its brutality.

I need to play this with at least a nearly full compliment of players to know if it is really as great as I think it is.  Right now it's looking pretty good if not excellent.  It has politics that matter and threats that can be countered with diplomacy, negotiation and alliance.

The game is perfect.  It has a lord with no arms and a knight wearing a bra.  I honestly think it might be illegal to criticize a game containing these things.  Also, the english rulebook seems to have gotten shorted on this week's comma rations as it only has one in the damn whole book.  That said, it is still my favorite game from Essen 2011 and ranks extremely high on my list of favorite games ever.

The rules are a mess: needlessly complex, badly written, and sometimes incoherent, the game is too random and your perfectly planned path to victory can get ruined with one roll of dice, when your heir to the throne is suddenly struck with the Black Plague. Yet, the three times I played it nobody seemed to mind these small faults and we thoroughly enjoyed planning royal marriages, hiring assasins, stoning bishops and escaping from prisons through secret tunnels. The theme really carries through to the gameplay and is highlighted by the beautiful components.

Take control of a medieval family and try to become the most powerful! Make alliances, kill your wife or husband to get its territories, or be a good ally.... But make sure no one's trying to double-cross you. A fantastic diplomacy/strategy game!

Un jeu très tendu, très riche de par ses dimensions tactiques et diplomatiques (élections) avec plein de coups retors. La protection des remparts est illusoire à cause de la carte Souterrain et le dé supplémentaire de la pucelle décisif. Les cartes sont vraiment importantes et les batailles aléatoires. Mais quels rebondissements et quel plaisir !

Based on one play: One of those games where you don't need a lot of points to win however there are very few ways to get points. You battle your neighbors and vote to give people power but each vote can give a point and with only three points to win no one wants to move forward. So you form an allegiance by getting married in order to win as a team, which now requires four points. Each turn you basically look at who can win and try to stop them while at the same time trying to sneak a victory but since the path to victory is obvious you have to just hope you make it. I can see how this would have been good back in its day but compared to political and battle games we now have it just isn't very fun.

There's some really interesting stuff here, above all the elections. However, our game seemed to end well before it had actually begun with the election of king giving me the ability to suddenly catapult myself and my ally to 4 points on the fourth turn. There seem to be a lot of rules (and I say this as a wargamer) relative to the amount of actual game they provide. On the other hand, I wish combat had been made a bit more interesting. Still, I'd certainly play this again and maybe my rating would improve.

Interesting take on a semi-take-that push and pull Diplomacy-type game. It has a lot of very interesting and cool elements, but is really bogged down by trying to be so historically accurate. Having votes based on some things and give bonuses to other things and so many fiddly rules really turns me off of the game. There are some neat emergent things with titles and some combo powers, but the game is very imbalanced overall and really relies on players to self-balance everything. Feels like it could be a bit more streamlined and faster instead of so many little votes and things going on. The whole marriage and breaking marriages for alliances is really fascinating and I'd love a game based more around that. Either way, decent for what it is, but nothing amazing. Overall I think Game of Thrones is more interesting (although not by a ton either).

Read the rules, it makes me smile. Very excited to play this!

[Update 15-08-2013] Played this with four other newcomers to this game and it was great. Expect this to get better and better as we start to understand the relative value of things. But already, scheming was high and all really enjoyed this. Will defenitely get replayed, could become a group favorite.

[Update 28-10-2013] Kickstart coming 10th of November!! Will definitely check that one out!

[Update 17-12-2013] Replayed it again and it was indeed even better. Got several requests for this to be replayed again. Right now one of the group's favorite games to be played.

[Update 11-02-2014] Couldn't resist and jumped the gun on the reprint, including all expansions and the building pack. Figured that I probably would've bought the expansion pack for it's own price, so might as well get an upgraded base game with it. Should be no problem selling off the great first edition, as this game is very, very good on its own already.

[Update 11-02-2014] KS finished. Trading off this edition to see interest. Ideal path would be to keep it until 'KS replacement' arrives. Else I would be 'without Fief' for quite a while :D

Really, the flavor of a fief game is just outstanding!
There are so much things to do ,argue with, discuss and think about!. A pure pulp game, with diplomacy, twists and turns, traitors and weddings...
Just love it!
Gather 4 friends of yours and try a fief session, hypocrasse suggested!:)

Negotiation driven wargame. Area control of colored fiefdoms by claiming villages and creating Fief Lords that tax the mills. Vote for control of the five bishoprics to claim tithe for that regions tax roll or become Cardinal and receive tithe from any mill. Finally, become Pope when there exists two Cardinals. Create alliances through marriage between lords by exchanging rings. This gives a benefit with the "f" dice. Alliances can only be broken by annulment, plague or if that isn't convenient then assassination! All this while raising armies, waging battles, and having nobles captured for ransom. First player to claim 3 victory points wins. Events are radically swingy. Rules nightmare. Watch White Queen for a primer or to set the atmosphere. Quinns does a brilliant breakdown.

A really nasty sort of game that has a disaster of an English translation for the rulebook. But, if you can sit back, do some external reading, and wrap your head around that the game is more about diplomacy that war gaming, it can make for a very memorable experience.

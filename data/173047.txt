Love the look and theme! I was hoping the expansion helped mitigate more the very random card drafting mechanic but so far the verdict is "still too random". The number of rule exceptions quickly become tiresome to keep track of. Perhaps with a wild suit added or some other significant addition it'll be worth adding to my collection?

Αλλο ένα Drafting παιχνίδι με κάρτες. Εδώ οι κανόνες είναι σχετικά απλοί. Υπάρχουν 5 είδη καρτών. Σπαθιά για να κάνεις damage, καρδιές για heal, δισκοπότηρα για πόντους, mana για να πάρεις spells και κοράκια που σε βλάπτουν και χάνεις μια από τις άλλες κάρτες σου για κάθε κοράκι. Εκτός και αν μαζέψεις φουλ κοράκια οπότε κάνεις παπάδες. Κάθε γύρα κάνουμε draft 5 καρτών σύνολο, άρα το πράμα κυλάει γρήγορα.

Μετά το draft ανοίγουμε τυχαία κάτι tiles για να δούμε τι θα γίνει πρώτα. Πχ το damage. Τότε δείχνουμε πόσες τέτοιες κάρτες έχει ο καθένας και αυτός που έχει τις περισσότερες κάνει τόσο damage όσο η διαφορά του από τον δεύτερο καλύτερο. Με τον ίδιο τρόπο λειτουργούν και τα υπόλοιπα σύμβολα. Για να κερδίσεις πρέπει να μαζέψεις πρώτος 6 πόντους ή να πεθάνουν όλοι (έχουμε από 5 life αρχικά) και να μείνεις μόνος σου. Βασικά δεν πεθαίνουν ακριβώς αλλά γίνονται κοράκια. Αυτό σημαίνει ότι δεν μπορούν να κερδίσουν εκτός και αν ξαναγίνουν άνθρωποι μαζεύοντας στο draft 5 ίδιες κάρτες ή μια από όλα τα είδη.

Το artwork είναι περιορισμένο και αρκετά dark, ενώ οι magic κάρτες αλλάζουν αρκετά τους κανόνες και δημιουργούν εκπλήξεις. Δυστυχώς δεν μου άρεσε το random resolution order των καρτών. Ειδικά στην παρτίδα μας που κρίθηκε στο αν θα βγει το damage και θα πεθάνει ο τελευταίος αντίπαλος πριν βγει το δισκοπότηρο και κερδίσει εκείνος από πόντους. Επίσης η τράπουλα είναι μεγάλη και παίζουμε κάθε φορά με λίγες κάρτες και δεν ξέρουμε την κατανομή των καρτών. Αλλιώς είναι να υπάρχει μόνο 1 mana ανάμεσα σε όλες τις κάρτες και αλλιώς να έχει συνολικά 5 οπότε όλα είναι ανοικτά. Χώρια το όλο χάος από την magic κάρτες.

Από την άλλη είναι καλή φάση που δεν έχει elimination και πως αν κάνεις 5άδες σε κάποιο είδος παίρνεις τρελά μπόνους. Επίσης ο χαμός με τα spells έχει την πλάκα του. Άλλο θετικό είναι πως το παιχνίδι μαθαίνει στους παίκτες να κάνουν hate drafting για να σπάνε το μονοπώλιο στα είδη και να μειώνουν έτσι το effect τους.  :arrrh:

Για casual χαβαλεδοκαταστάσεις είναι καλό. Αν προσπαθήσεις να το αναλύσεις περισσότερο θα δεις πως είναι πολύ random για να δεχθεί την οποιαδήποτε ανάλυση.

RATING: 8.1
A fun drafting game, I love that sense of direct conflict using Health points, and also the fact that 'eliminated' players are actually turned to Ravens, who can have quite a lot of fun pecking at the players still in the match...and perhaps even a shot at redemption. I'm not entirely getting the theme here, I guess it's like Edgar Allen Poe meets Game of Thrones; but the components look nice and it's just another of those games you don't expect much from and then become pleasantly surprised at.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
This won't win any awards, but its actually kind of fun.  This should of just been called "Cutthroat Caverns: The Card Game" and used the same theme / art... since that is basically what it is.  It's a card drafting game, with a large amount of take that.  Not sure I like the drafting mechanism much though, since you first pass 3 cards, then 2 cards, then 1 card, and this is always from your 5 card hand.   I prefer to draft 1 from the pool, add it to my hand, rinse and repeat.  Wouldn't mind playing this one more going forward, and this definitely has that Smirk and Dagger feel if you like their games.

A take that type game which has some interesting choices with the cards that cancel other cards and the random resolution of the different suit effects.  The magic cards are interesting can give you a leg up if played correctly.  If you are into the take that type games then this would be great for you, but as someone who is not really a fan of this type of game it is just meh.

Card game based on Edgar Allen Poe's poem, Nevermore.  It has a press your luck kind of element by the fact that if you're the only one playing the type of card you get more bonuses, but if there are other players playing the same card the bonuses diminish.  Scoring is based on what cards and such you collect.  Crows are bad, unless you're able to collect a lot of them.

RATING: 8
Simple drafting game with claws, makes effective use of only five different card faces. Players win by either accumulating six VPs or eliminating everyone else. Although player elimination is present, but players aren't actually eliminated from the game as they're transformed into ravens (very fitting with the Edgar Allen Poe theme, otherwise the theme is barebones) but can still influence the game, either by winning with cards during the resolution phase and pecking those who come second place or by transforming back into a human by having five of one suit or one of each suit. Shadow Magic cards allow players to screw over other people, while Light Magic cards generally benefit the player but can also do some dramatic plays like skipping the drafting phase entirely.

Lots of shit talking with the people I play with, which dramatically increases the amount of fun I have playing this game. Playing this straight without banter would be an exercise in frustration for me.

A unique take on drafting. No progression on the cards like other drafting games, but takes just as long in order to achieve one of 3 possible victory conditions. Highly interactive.

Very light since you don't see many cards and won't be able to deduce much of your opponents strategy that round due to the limited draft.

RATING: 4.5
It's a drafting game that just doesn't seem to balance well.  Scoring points early means you'll get semi-eliminated first.  You can come back if you get the right cards in your hand, but the card distribution is random every time, so it's almost never worth trying and you choose to just screw up everybody else instead.  The game is too random to be a full-feature game, but the time it takes to play is too variable to be a reliable filler.  It's one of those games that can be fun for a few rounds, but it'll inevitably start to drag.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This game is just north of fun, but can be an absolutely amazing time with the right group. The magic cards are a mechanic I feel like lacks elegance, but the game as a whole is rather fluid.

RATING: 4.2843
Each of my three games of this lasted over 1 hour.
AND each of my three games became a grind after 25 minutes.

If you don't get magic (either light or dark), you are at the mercy of those who do and the game they decide to play.

There is very little method of "catching up" when the "magic" folk have 3+ cards that will stop your cards, stop a round, or advance their cause.

If the game was over in 20 minutes, that would be fine.

OR if the game were longer AND if there was a way to balance the magic distribution (house rule of every turn the player with the lowest magic gets 1 magic of choice), that MIGHT be fine as well.

I just can't enjoy the game with the current mechanics.

Great quick fun drafting game. You really have to be aware of what you're passing, and not just totally focused on your hand which makes for great play.

The fact that when you're out of health you aren't eliminated, but in fact have more options to being aggressive with your play is fun. Added to the fact that you still have a way to win the game makes it a fun state to be in.

The art is beautiful, the game plays great. Highly recommended.

Smirk & Dagger proves once again that backstabbing is the way to go. Though this is by far not as bad as Cutthroat Caverns when it comes to the backstabbing department, it is still a great game with card drafting, trying to outsmart your opponents and play some nasty cards from time to time.

RATING: 5
Feels like cutthroat caverns the card drafting game. The choices are kind of limited each round because you tend to aim for as many of a suit as you can.

Interesting mechanics but the drafting part is quite light, it's an ok game if you have the right expectations for it coming in.

Purchased at GenCon 2015, Nevermore is from Smirk & Dagger - the makers of Hex Hex. While also a take-that game, there is less randomness in Nevermore, allowing more strategy to take hold. Magic cards provide hidden edges when used at the right time, and the inability to outright kill a player is a fantastic feature for player buy-in.

The game itself is phenomenal!  However, the cards were made with relatively cheap material; after playing 15 games (at a food & drink-free table), the cards stick together and do not shuffle neatly/consistently.  We will have to get card protectors before we can play it again.

Really interesting game.

I like games with interesting decisions and this has a ton of them. 

It also has a ton of crazy randomness in the magic cards, which I had mixed feelings about.  When the game was short I enjoyed the randomness, because it led to a lot of funny moments and some nasty "take that" surprises.  However there were also games where the randomness caused the game to drag on and in longer games there is so much magic that the game completely breaks down and it loses all focus and structure.

Overall it's a game I enjoyed, but would only play again in the right situation/mood.

Update:  Upon further review I'm dropping this down to 6.5 because as we've become more experienced with the game we're making better, more strategic decisions and as a result the short games are becoming more rare and the long drawn out games are becoming more frequent.

Card majority drafting game with some different mechanics. Racing to get 6 victory points, which are earned directly through cards or drafting collections of cards.

The cards resolve at different times, depending on when they're flipped in the hidden order.

Card game that feels a lot like King of Tokyo when played.

Nevermore is a casual-style, card-drafting game in which you quickly build your hand each round, collecting cards you want and poisoning your opponent's hand by passing along cards you think they can't use. Whoever holds the most of a given suit, gains the power of that suit to attack, heal, acquire Light or Shadow magicks and score victory points.

Unique card game where you are trying to acquire one of five suits.  Some suits attack other players, some provide victory  points, others heals, other provide black or white magic cards.  It was interesting but reminded me a bit of bang but without the social deduction element.

My first Smirk & Dagger game. It was alright. It's a very simple game of card drafting and majority scoring. It goes on a little longer than I would like though. A game this chaotic shouldn't go on as long as Nevermore does. This seems like it would be a better game with more people, and if it ended after 4 or 5 rounds at most. At the end of the day though, if I want a game where I'm trying to score points or beat the other players down, I'd just play King of Tokyo.

Decent card-drafting game of trying to get more of a suit than others.  The passing strategy seems to be more important than the keeping strategy in this game vs other similar types.

Light card drafting filler. Short and to the point. And like the game box says, it's important to watch what cards you send to the other players in the drafting phase.

Turning into ravens instead of being eliminated is a great and important detail. You can't win as a raven, but there is a chance you can turn back into a human.

Card Drafting game where you are trying to gain majorities. Hard to manage the cards since so many will be passed to the next player. Found there to be no real build up and much too long for the game being playing. Didn't mind the game but ended up trading it away.

 A neat little game of drafting and drafting. And shouting "CAW" over and over again. Each round you draft by passing three, then two, then one card to the left or right, and then resolve the different types of cards in a randomly generated order. Whoever has the most of a card type gets its benefit an amount equal to the difference between the number of cards they played and the second most played. So cups give VP (with 6 needed to win), daggers deal damage (with each player starting with 5), hearts heal (healing three over your max in one go gives you VP), and radiance which gives you white magic spells (which can be played at different times to produce game changing effects). Then there are raven cards. If you have a raven card, it has to be played at some point to negate another card. But, if you end up with leftover ravens at the end of a hand, then if you have the most you can get more powerful black magic spells. If you manage to get a hand of five ravens (which can be made easier by some spells) you instawin the game. So shoving away ravens all the time isn't necessarily bad, and failing to get a conspiracy will usually net you some black magic cards.

Each round moves really quick as there are only five types of cards to choose from, and it takes a fair amount of rounds to start accruing VP. If you get killed by daggers, you're transformed into a Raven, and then you can win by turning everyone else into Ravens, or you can try and get a straight or five of a kind to turn back to human.

Pure chaos filled with too many take-that actions. The cards range from game breakingly awful to totally useless. It is totally possible for this game to never end, since it is even easier to take away victory points than it is to gain any. Nevermore is a chore to get through. A few obvious house rules would improve this game ten fold.

About all you can ask for in a quick drafting game. Clever mechanics for winning a suit, the winner given power to damage, heal, gain magic spells or victory points, depending on the suit. Has a "shoot the moon" mechanic with the Raven suit, which is a lot of fun. Easy to learn. Worth $20 (I paid more at GenCon, but it's GenCon).

I'd actually true-rate this around an 8.5 for "games I'd like to pick up and play quickly with casual gaming friends." I bumped the rating up to 10 to counter-balance people who, for some reason, rate games that are of a type they don't enjoy playing (similar to a vegetarian rating a steak house).

1.15.17 - (2 plays) Not bad for a 20-30 minute drafting game. I'll play again if it's suggested. The drafting and set collection was more fun than the spells. Nice mechanic to avoid player elimination.

Played 3 times in a row with 5 Players. Quick and Cool Game. :)

It's not to boring or to complex for a card game. Turn others into raven is really fun but they will hurt you back. Love it :)

+ Short Game around 30 Mins (you can play it more than once)
+ No Down Time (Shuffle Cards is normal in a card game)
+ No player will be eliminated
+ Powerful and useful Cards (even if the black are slightly better)
+ Beautiful Artwork
(+ No Big Table necessary)

I don't understand why its so underrated. Sure its a filler Game, but really worth it price.

A drafting game that doesn't use the drafting mechanism all that well. Unfortunately luck of draw is way too strong with this game, and some cards have way too much "take that" element that just makes the game painful to play.

This game works differently from any other drafting game I've played, but I liked it. The difficulty a raven faces in getting back into the game means that they usually end up just attacking other players, which speeds up the game towards the end.

There are a lot of novel ideas in this game -- I like the twist on drafting (3 cards, 2, then 1 card), and the 'light/dark magic' cards that change the rules a bit. The 'first place minus second place' is also a cool idea. The rules around what happens when you become a raven are interesting, too. The main downside is the tendency to beat up on the leader, especially with some of the magic cards that can really swing the game. I'd definitely play it again, though.

RATING: 5
This is a really random drafting game that gives me Fluxx-ish vibes, and for me that's not a good thing.

In this game a large deck of cards containing 5 different possibilities is shuffled and each player is dealt 5 cards at the start of each round.  Then a drafting phase occurs where players will pass 3, 2, then 1 card all in the same direction.  Then a random order of rounds corresponding to the 5 different cards takes place and players play the cards they ended up with during the appropriate rounds.  These cards allow players to attack other players, heal, gain special spell cards, and earn victory points.  The goal of the game is to earn 6 victory points or eliminate all other players.  The last card type is the crow which is special because it cancels out other cards but if you start a hand with 5 you do one damage to all other players and gain a victory point and if you end the round with any extra you also gain special spell cards.

Here are some of the problems with the game, first of all it is entirely too random.  I enjoy randomness in games as long as players are presented with ways and opportunity to mitigate that chaos and there is none of that here.  The rigid structure of the draft makes it so you very rarely are able to collect the cards you need or learn or effect what other players besides your immediate neighbor receive.  And then you have COMPLETE control over what your immediate neighbor is getting and the same goes for your neighbor on your other side who shapes 60% of your hand for you.  On top of that there  is an issue where whoever is doing well gets the full wrath of everyone else at the table immediately so the only real way to win is to take a lesson from the tortoise in Aesop's fable.  Because of this also you have a case where a simple card game that should be over in under 30 minutes can end up taking hours because the game is endlessly delayed by taking out whoever is currently doing the best.

The ideas here are neat, I will give it that, but I think it needs to be refined into a little better of a design that fits the form factor of this large group/small footprint game.

My daughter really likes this game. I'm not a hard-core "Take that" kind of gamer, so for me this isn't a top-of-the-list favorite. I do, however, really like Cutthroat Caverns by the same publishers, so I guess there is a little back-stabbiness in me after all.

I picked this one up after positive reviews from the Dice Tower. While I am not as high on it as they are, I still think there is a solid, engaging, fun game here. Basically, Nevermore gives you card drafting + set collection + some take that (this is Smirk & Dagger after all) in a well-produced game. If you like those elements, chances are you'll enjoy what Nevermore has to offer.

Smirk & Dagger's best game design yet, and probably also their simplest.
Two of the people I've played this with have gone on to buy copies of their own because they liked it so much and could see their other friends liking it as well. 
The only down-side is that the initial rules explanation can be a bit overwhelming for new players, and it takes a hand or two before everything 'clicks'. Once it does though, it becomes a very interesting and deliciously mean little game.

This game managed to make card drafting, interactive and without needing a ton of scoring to find out who won at the end.  It's pretty much everything I ever wanted in a drafting game, but for some reason I'm not too excited about it after I played it.  I don't really have any complaints about it, it was fun, I'm just not in a rush to play it again.

Won a signed copy in a BGG contest.

Different from many drafting games in that you can make plays to affect the other players besides hate drafting. There are some really interesting elements working here such as working for the second highest in a suit to minimize the reward for the winner as an alternate strategy to full blown card denial.

I will say that even though I love player interaction there are a handful of cards that can make for epic plays but can prolong the game past its prime length. Easy enough to play without those though.

Push your luck set collection game. Great rule to avoid player elimination with turning into a raven and still "playing" and able to come back to life.  Seems some dark/light magic cards are much better then others. Not my favorite of the drafting games but pretty good nonetheless.

There is something here but also a lot of little things to remember (an non-issue for those who will play a lot).
I like the non-elimination and drafting. Drafting is brutal with the 3-2-1 and may leave you feeling with less control. Set rules bonus rules (do more than 4 damage, X of kind, etc) should have been printed on the rotation reminder board. Interesting but some rules are a bit disjointed (probably balancing issues).

Two rules of design are violated here: (1) players who are effectively eliminated in terrible games shouldn't have to keep playing and (2) terrible games shouldn't have VP-loss mechanics that extend game length.

In the plus column, this has one of the most brilliant mechanics ever created: if you hate the game, you can feed VP cards to the players to your immediate left and right to end your misery quickly.

And in the "you knew it was coming" category, here's the conversation held at the end of every session:

[i]"Wow, that was mildly entertaining. Shall we play again?"

"B*tch please," croaked the raven. "Nevermore."[/i]

I have yet to play this with more than 4 people and I think it might be better with more. With the lower player counts though, it is rather boring. The theme doesn't come through and it's not as engaging or interactive as I would like.

RATING: 5
Chaotic negotiation game with significant random elements, and a decent theme.

Each round, cards (store locations) and then tiles (stores) are randomly distributed to each player, and then players essentially negotiate for anything and everything (stores, store locations, money), in an effort to make the largest groupings of stores together, in order to achieve the ultimate goal of most money (larger grouped stores equals more money each round).  Pure negotiation chaos, which makes the game very unique, but necessarily great.   Can be frustrating if your store tiles and/or locations are in bad spots- true you can often turn them into valuable items for others, but sometimes there's just nothing that can be done.  There are also random event cards drawn at the end of each round, which can have a not unsignificant impact on income.  All in all, an interesting but somewhat overrated game that probably isn't worth the $100 or so you'd have to pay to obtain a copy.

To win without negotiation requires a LOT of luck. Negotiation and bargaining skill -- aided by a sense of what something is REALLY worth in game terms -- is a requirement for winning using skill.

Aside from Diplomacy, not many games do this as well as this one does.

I don't really know whether I was disappointed or not when I finally got to play this game. Basically Chinatown is a good trading game in which everything is nicely balanced. But still if I wanted to trade, I'd play Bohnanza. However, the game plays relatively quick which is a good thing.

*Rating based on one play.

This older title is almost pure negotiation.  There's just enough to the game to make things to negotiate over, but the meat of the game is in the negotiation.  For that reason, it's a highly interactive game, but not in a take-that kind of way.  Rather, it's almost semi-cooperative in that you have to think about what the other players want in order to make appealing offers to them, or at least be able to convince them that a deal is good for them.  I enjoyed this type of interaction.

However, I feel the game is just a bit too simple for my taste.  I would have liked a few more layers of depth to it.  I also felt that the end game was rather disappointing.  Maybe it was just the way our first play shook out, but there were almost no trades in the final round, which felt anti-climactic.  I feel like there needs to be more of a ramp in income for larger, incomplete businesses.  As it was, in the final round, my options were limited to playing out my three tiles for $1,000 each, or buying a matching one for an extra $2,000, but at the cost of $1,000 for the tile and the loss of $1,000 for having an extra tile I couldn't play.  The other players were largely in the same position, so the last round was very unexciting.

In the end, I felt it was a decent game, but felt it had some room for improvement.

RATING: 5
Based on a single 3 player game. There just didn't seem to be any trading which I'm told is the whole point of the game. We played without the randomisers and as such, we could easily calculate the worth of all trades and so therefore didn't bother (and 2 players wouldn't collude to better the 3rd). Might play again if it were 5 player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.23
One of the best, purest trading games there is.  That's good and bad, of course--it means the enjoyability of the game is highly influenced by the players at the table (and how good all players are in assessing the relative value of particular tiles).

FAMILY, STRATEGY

Develop wealth in Chinatown (in New York) by bargaining (trading) for land and businesses with other players. Player with the most cash after six "years" (rounds) of play wins! A highly interactive game.

This game can be a real nail-biter. In one game, only $10,000 (the smallest denomination) separated Nick and me. 

Recommended with 4-5 players (best 5). 60 mins.

A game that is all about its negotiation phase.  Every other phase is just setting you up with resources (buildings, businesses, money) to trade.  I like the high level of interaction and I like the potential for some surprisingly involved trades.  While I've had fun playing Chinatown, there is a slight sense of "is that all there is?" about it.

I owned the Filosofia German edition of the game.  It's quite nicely produced with decent artwork, although the bits do  rattle around in a great big box.

Simple negotiation game where everything and I mean everything is up for trade. Super easy to teach and play. There is quite some luck in the tile draw. What I did not like about the game is how easy it is to calculate the value for each tile to each player. This does not leave  much space for negotiation and 'smart' plays.

All in all it is a good gateway negotiation game.

RATING: 7
This is almost a pure negotiation game.  As a rule I'm pretty good at these types of games.  For example I've won well over half of my Bohnanza plays, despite the fact that the typical game has at least 5 players.  I've only played Chinatown twice, both times mostly against players who've had much more experience with the game than me, and I've won both times.  On reflection I think this is due to two things.  With negotiation games, despite the fact that I am otherwise fairly introverted, I go out of my way to make deals, and I have an intuitive feel for exactly when to drive or not drive a hard bargain.  I like Chinatown, though don't know that I'd ever ask to play it.  Z-man's edition is visually very attractive, but I have to be honest, the box is just full of air and the retail price is a bit high for what you get in terms of components.

The rules are simple. As long as you don't attract the type who'd refuse to buy a new car over a $100 difference, it's fun. Anything/everything can be negotiated/sold. There's a little bit of math, but not too much. The new version does a better job than the old version in describing the maths (values of the buildings). The first time I played this, the term Elegant suddenly made perfect sense.

Un par de partidas no registradas.

Aunque los componentes de la edición de Filosofía son bastante buenos (salvo la caja, demasiado grande para lo que trae), el juego nos dejó un poco fríos para lo que esperábamos.

Muy azaroso en la obtención de los terrenos (puede resultar decisivo) y si el grupo no es muy extrovertido la fase de negociación decae y el juego flojea bastante. Por otro lado, jugarlo con alguien demasiado calculador y matemático puede resultar insufrible.

La mecánica es simple y puede resultar repetitivo para jugarlo a menudo.

RATING: 7
An interesting blend of pure negotiation and high luck elements.  The random draw of the land plots and the business tiles makes the game highly luck dependent.  This is off-set by the amount of negotiation that the game encourages.  Effective trading will lead to better results, but you most be good at negotiation to convince people to "let you win".  The drawback to the design is that if a player gets great draws and doesn't need to negotiate, it can be very tough to win.  [GTI Code: AGCD]

Chinatown fills by itself a niche in the hobby: it is a light weight pure negotiation game.

Many parts of its design are potentially bad, especially when seen with the eyes of the modern boardgamer: the game is full of randomness, but after the district card have been dealt, all the information is open and therefore each deal is calculable. And there are issues with potential runaway leaders too...
But in the end the game is fun, the negotiation that ensues is very thematic, and the relative short playtime makes the game don't overstay its welcome.

I thought I didn't enjoy pure negotiation games, but Chinatown made me change my mind!

Initial Impression: What a great game! The rules are super simple and this has to be one of the easiest games I've ever taught. The gameplay is quick, with only 6 turns, and each phase of a turn is short and sweet. The main mechanism, the negotiation, is done just right as people aren't hindered by constraints. There are just the right number of resources to negotiate with and even AP prone players will be able to keep up with the wheeling and dealing. I can see this getting to the table for many more plays.

Played once as a 5-player game with the rules explained to me.  Keep in mind that I hate negotiation games which feature the random distribution of resources.  Anyway, Chinatown allows players to negotiate anything in their possession for as long as they want to continue talking.  I usually do not have the stamina for these types of games for the trading rounds take forever when people are trying to get something from one person so that they can trade it and something else to another person, but more than one person is trying to do the same thing... After five minutes of this I endup withdrawing and hoping for the trading rounds to end as soon as possible.  

The components are fantastic!  The money is the best paper money that I have ever seen in gaming.

Great negotitian game. I feel it a good game to play only if negotitaion is fast & players avoid too much analysis and just negotiate with what they feel. This way game is quick, fun and enjoyable. Otherwise I think game will go tool long with few deals, too many calculations and might get boring.

RATING: 7.5
Simple mechanic but very nice feel and flow through the phases. There is an element of luck with the plot card distribution and business tile draw, but this is offset to a degree during the trading phase. Initial impressions are that I like it alot, but wonder if the rub of the luck might start to p*ss me off eventually.

You have GOT to be ready to play this.  That's all there is to it.  There will be some ball-bustin' negotiation with everything on the line.  It is not a game for a casual evening.

The only thing I really don't like about it, is the money in the z-man printing---SUCKS.  If you have poker chips, I highly recommend bringing them out.  Otherwise, they use the green-back system with different currencies, and it makes it really hard to deal with.

Other than that, it's a really awesome game to have in my stable and it fills a pretty big hole on genres of games I don't have.  It's like the only good part of monopoly condensed and undiluted.

I don't like negotiation, so I went in with a bad attitude, but I ended up liking it. I wouldn't choose it, but I would definitely play again.

Let me warn you, negotiation games rank as one of my least favorite genres.  With that said, Chinatown is among the better entries.  Unfortunately, the values of items gradually grow translucent as the rounds progress.  Thus, the last two rounds fail to captivate as people haggle over a couple thousand trivial dollars.  Traders of Genoa still holds the title of best negotiation game.

Good negotiation & trading game.  Almost a pure negotiation game... leaves me wanting more structure and faster turns.  It's possible to get crushed by luck once in a while if you cannot get the right locations or you get crappy cards and pick the "wrong" ones to keep (i.e. building locations that nobody cares about).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
A bit abstract, a bit of luck (cos your tiles and card locations could be really really bad!) and a lot of negociation in this tile laying / set making trading game. Not enough structure for me really with all that luck, but you can't take this one too seriously.

Much better when using the Westbank Gamers variant (hidden business tiles and trading property cards). Seems to be a comfortable step up for gamers who enjoy the trading aspect of Bohnanza... 
***UPDATE*** Downgraded to a 6 as the luck of the draw factor rears its ugly head. I won the last game by a reasonable margin and most of that was down to the fact that I drew an inordinate amount of tiles for a particular area. When looking to scratch my 'trading' itch I look to Traders of Genoa.

The fun thing about this game is the free form wheeling and dealing. It's set collection with a twist because of the area control. Towards the end the options to trade get less and less and the last one or two rounds often feel a bit like an anticlimax.

I would say that the play time is actually less than advertised. Which is great, given its weight.

Real disappointment - feels a bit like Acquire with trading thrown in. Downtime is horrible, listening to others arguing over who should get what gets tedious fast, deals between 2 people are okay, but when it involves 3 or 4, or is dependant on other trades happening (so you have chains) whole thing drags, would hate to play this with a slow player! 

Also there's no real balance mechanism for the rich getting richer - if I have a tile you want and I'm ahead of you why would I trade? Only if I'm forcing you to a deal that helps me more than you. Of course people behind the leader need to trade to catch up. There's too much open information, yes cash is secret but it's not hard to track, especially as income is open and deals are open too.

Was desperate to get this, having played it now I'm not!!

First play of this game I own, with 5 people. Upon reading the rules I was afraid luck of the draw would factor too heavily into who might win, but this wasn't the case. The other thing I thought upon reading the rules was this was a streamlined game without a lot of finnicky side rules or exceptions, and that was absolutely true. Nice.

We played with a 3-minute timer on negotiating, and it was a fun game with lots of deals and swings in who seemed to be was winning. I held out giving one player the key piece he needed to complete a 6-store set until the last turn of the game (when he could do the same for me), and that was the difference that let me win this game. Will be interesting to play again; I could see this going up to a 7.5 or maybe even an 8.

I really like business in a game and Chinatown has that aspect in it. I feel that there might be a bit of a runaway problem in the game if all players don't know what they do and definitely there is a possibility for a king-making.

Edit: Now that the new version is out in Finland and I have played the game few times I raise the rating. Chinatown is definitely a solid business game.

Almost more an experience than a game. Players build and expand their businesses in the districts of Chinatown. This wound feel very much like Acquire (and maybe that's by design) but for the idea that everything is liquid and tradable: empty lots, buildings, future promises and victory points can be bought or sold in exchange for what you want.

I know it's expensive. This truly is one of the greats and worthy of your time.

RATING: 6
A very fun, if mildly unsatisfying game. The constant negotiation is really interesting, and reminds me a lot of Bohnanza, except in Chinatown you might actively pass on taking something that could benefit you in favor of taking something that you know your opponents really want. Bargaining power is ultimate power in this game, which is really neat, and makes this game unlike any other that I own.

Unfortunately, you still can't get around the luck factor: drawing the right cards or combinations of tiles can simply favor one player over another, and no amount of cajoling or begging on the part of the other players can change that. Of course, you can refuse to trade with someone in the lead, but often you're so limited yourself that you need their help more than they need yours. So, ultimately it's a fun game, but maybe not a very good one.

RATING: 7
Excellent negotiation game, but it can take a while since calculating the value of the deals isn't hard (just time consuming).  Luck of the draw plays a larger role than I like.  If you draw lots that are far away from the other players, or businesses that nobody needs at the moment, you aren't involved in the deals and your position stagnates.  Add to this that not all lots and buildings come out during the game and you can end up in a position where your best investment options are never available.  Sure, you can (and must) account for this as you play, but this style of game makes it particularly painful to lose based on luck (bad rolls in a dice game = expected; not drawing anything of value in a negotiation game = sucks).

Absolutely wonderful stripped-down negotiation game.  Everything is able to be traded, yet the predictability of long-term value is not particularly esoteric.  The math is there, but since it is on the surface, the game becomes about the risks and rewards present.  Luck mitigators and enough options are present to help ensure the game is not decided by lucky draws.  Highly recommended.

I'm not much on negotiation games, but this one isn't half bad.  As is with any negotiation game, it may be pretty group dependent as to how much I enjoy it though.  If the haggling goes on endlessly, I'm going to hate it.  If the bargaining is reasonable and executed fairly quickly, I'm going to enjoy it a lot more.  Chinatown actually does a great job at taking a very simple idea and making into a pretty neat game.

RATING: 6.6
Enjoyable stripped down game that's very pure.  It takes the negotiation mechanic and frames what little other mechanisms occur completely around it.  This means your enjoyment of the game depends on your engagement in making deals which is both good and bad.  I definitely dig its simplicity and old time Euro feel.

With that being said, I don't see myself itching to come back to this one.  It does the negotiation well, but I think I'd rather play Cosmic Encounter every time, or failing that Sons of Anarchy.  Both are more dramatic negotiation games and allow for more bravado and memorable action.

I was considering Sidereal Confluence, but I know that the game is probably too heavy for our group. Chinatown is also a real-time negotiation game, but I think it is much, much lighter.

A lot of people talk about Lords of Vegas being a better game, but Patricia doesn't like dice. I think that might make this game a better choice.

Though it's currently between print runs, I managed to find a new copy at a reasonable price.

I have played a couple of three-player games, and I like it. I suspect it'll be a lot more fun with more players.

I play this with open tiles and open money, plus start players with some cash. I feel it increases the odds of deal making, which makes for a more enjoyable game. Playing this game without making deals would be a waste of time. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoy this game when I play it (I'm a sucker for the genre), but the fact that the deals are fully calculable makes it hard to want to bust it out that often. In a game like this, if everyone is making optimal deals then it all kind of comes down to luck of the draw... and in this particular game it's too easy to see if a deal is optimal or not. The hidden money definitely helps but it's not really enough, I think. Still, it has a really nice pace and it's a good length so it's easier to bust out than something like Genoa.

Wouldn't be surprised if my rating drops over time, though.

A very easy game to teach and should play in under an hour provided players don't allow the trading phase to drag on endlessly. 

This fun peaks around turns 3 and 4 where the trading is key. Early on, everyone is being cautious and waiting to see if they can pick up some connected premises and sets of buildings and then towards the end trading is far less important. Players just fill up their vacant properties knowing they'll not complete a business.

Good negotiating game where everything is negotiable. A lot of this game depends on the game group it is played with, Definitely best with 4 or 5 players for more interactions.

Beautifully illustrated game of trading. Everything is up for grabs. The one major complaint I have with this game is that the currency is all the same color. Makes it difficult to keep the pace of the game going quickly because you are always stopping and verifying what money is changing hands.

Chinatown is the best negotiation game I have found so far. There are just enough rules to provide a framework for the haggling, but the free-for-all negotiation is a blast. Very, very interactive, especially when there is no true structure to the trading.... anything goes. This type of game might be a turnoff for some, but as long as everyone is not a total introvert, or at least has 10% of a used-car salesman inside them... this game will help them discover it.

If every negotiation game needs a "driver" to generate the haggling, Chinatown's drivers are the need to collect certain tiles, followed by the need to gather the adjacent spots to place those tiles. There's never any downtime in Chinatown, as the round ends when everyone decides it should end. There are strong motivations for negotiating.

Another perk is that Chinatown is truly a gateway game. It's very accessible for new gamers, and the incredibly attractive Z-Man Games edition adds to the pull for newbies. There is a single but important nitpick--I can see the merit to critiques about the endgame grinding to a halt if gamers start to "do the math" in the final rounds, but the remedy is to pick the right players, and possibly, to introduce the optional bonus cards that dole out a little extra cash for certain building sizes. I'm still convinced this is the ideal entry-level negotiation game.

Had a lot of fun with this one.  I really enjoy games where bartering is the meat of it.  It really feels like when you're doing well, you're doing well because of you.  There is quite a bit of randomness in the game with drawing cards and tiles, but it didn't feel like that imbalanced our game much, I think it's required to force some people to negotiate.  I look forward to getting this back to the table quickly.

Traded for Villa Paletti. Never played. Kind of a shame, but every time I thought about playing a negotiation game, I either wanted Genoa (for serious negotiation) or Lifeboats (for something light) or Intrigue (for some thing evil). And now there is Greed, Inc. Chinatown will never see action.

This is a very good pure negotiation game.  I think I slightly prefer Traders of Genoa (also in the Alea line), but Chinatown is more "free form" and will certainly appeal to the haggler in the group.  This game is one of the easier ones in the Alea line to understand... and can play rather quickly if you set some reasonable time limits on the trading phase.

Chinatown is a game where you are a Chinese immigrant in America 1960 something and you are trying to make your business bloom by building shops and making deals with other Chinese immigrants. The one who have the most money in the end RULES CHINATOWN WITH AN IRON GRIP!!! or that's what i like to think.  

Chinatown is as the subtitle say a game about negotiation. If you look in wikipedia it says "Negotiation is a dialogue between two or more people or parties intended to reach a beneficial outcome", this game is not about two parties getting a benefical outcome.
This game, in the deep of it, is about mind games, tricking your opponent into thinking it was a good deal by using false logic and math. 

And the feeling, knowing that you have tricked your friend giving you their hard earned money to you in a desperate move you improve their income but you have really just lured them into a economic trap where you have the leverage, is goooood. 

As you might have guessed this is not a friendly game. 
You can play it as one but it would be a boring variant of..well.. life. 
This is you taking up the role as a cutthroat angry  Chinese immigrant willing to kill (no you cannot do that in  this game) for more money and more power. 

This game is not something i bring every game night, but it appears about 6-8 times ayear on the table. 
It is easy you teach and takes about 1-2 hours with 5 people. 
I could teach my 5 year old son this game but it would probably end up with me stealing all his money and dancing. 

This game is hubris in a box and i love it!

Chinatown doesn't get me. It's not bad, but it's really only about one thing: all the same terse negotiations you have during the final stages of Monopoly. Now imagine hours of that sort of friendship ending shouting match with nothing else behind it. If your table likes that sort of gameplay, you'll probably have a good time here. If even one person isn't as into that type of conflict, however, it's going to throw the whole thing off.

RATING: 2
Chinatown is a game with way too much open information and it additionally, like most trading/negotiation games, depends heavily the personality of the group you're playing it with for maximum enjoyment.

The basic idea behind this game is pretty simple: you want to control blocks of businesses on a board depicting Chinatown. The business tiles are randomly drawn, as are the lot ownership rights, and both of these can then be swapped about freely during the trading phase of the game, which is the real meat of the game. Players ideally want to get connected lines of like businesses, with the rarer business types paying out larger returns if you get a complete "set".

I played it with a group of 5 people, which seems like it would be the best scale, but the luck of the draw, though fixable by dealing, seems a little too dominant in dictating who has the upper hand. Chinatown felt like a math puzzle at some level as well. The game should be fun for its free-wheeling haggleathons, but everything ended up feeling too calculable which really stifles negotiations.

The "I've got what you need and refuse to deal with you" aspect is also a large one for me, if someone is in the lead and you're in second, and they draw the last tile you need there is no way to get it away from them. The real killer though is the nigh completely open information, it is way too easy to calculate the value of a given trade out, and hence, negotiations frequently end up stalling out. The only place you can get ahead against savvy opponents is in the draw, which isn't exactly a mark of distinction for me. Calculable information can be OK, but I think that it has to be transitory, i.e.: there can be events that occur which change that value significantly. This is why, for instance, the calculations of Modern Art work for me (you don't know when the round is going to end, you don't know if the painting is going to maintain its current value) and why games like Container and Chinatown don't...you know what the stuff is worth, flat out, and it's just a question of trying to get a fair cut of the action.

One of the early alea disappointments from back when the label was actually reliable. I had expected that its reputation would suffer noticeably when it was reprinted, but somehow this one continues to attract fans, and I can honestly say it's one of the few well-regarded games that I dislike where I can't even academically understand what people are seeing here that I'm not. I think Traders of Genoa is still and likely always will be my go-to in the pure negotiation genre. It has all of the haggling of this one, but adds a lot of closed information about the value of items which makes things move along much better.

This is a negotiation game in the truest sense of the word. In it, players acquire ownership of sections of city blocks then place tiles, representing businesses, onto the block-sections. At the end of each turn, each tile you've laid gives you some sort of payout, but completed businesses pay quite a bit better. Most money at the end wins!

I don't like this game as much as I should, perhaps because the dealing gets more stagnant as the game goes on.  It's a fun game where there's lots of dealing to be made, but I prefer something like Genoa where deals can get downright creative and valuation takes on a very important role.  Still, it's a classic and one that I'm sure I'll play again.

After one play. This is one of the better negotiation games I have played. With the right people for that type of game this is fun. Negotiation is wide open, and almost anything goes. Rating isn't quite as high as it could be because of the playability. You really need the right people to make it fun, and I hesitate to say that a majority of people would fit into the "right people" group. Otherwise, quite straight forward rules and very little downtime, (unless you have nothing left to bargain for or with)

Overhyped game which needs quite a few rules changes in order to work properly. 
The so-called "Westbank variant" helps a lot. 
Other fixes are needed to give more incentives to complete bigger businesses.

Without the variants, I give a 3.
With all the variants, the game is an 8.

After playing I can't really imagine why people were pining after this game before it was republished. Massive sums of money exchanged hands... but after having played I conclude it has nothing to do with the qualities of the game and everything with a severe case of completitis—that nasty disease which has the infected person try to 'collect' as many things as possible from a series, against better judgment about the qualities of the things collected.

I perceive to be the main issue of the game that a deal's worth can be accurately calculated. Once players know how to do this quickly and accurately, Chinatown becomes a game of speculation against the luck of the draw stack and bag—my what interesting diversions. The only way to make this game work is by simply ignoring that you can calculate matters, but then I wonder what the purpose of the game is in the first place. If a trading game is going to work, values of lots must have different values to different people. 

I think I'm going to leave it at the first game.

I was really surprised that my youngest son found this game so enjoyable. Everybody is making deals with everybody in a mad chinamans race to earn the most money.
Any deal could be made : Plots for store tiles. Store tiles for cold cash etc. etc. Lose every game we play but I don`t mind as long as I know he loves the ride. If you get upset for being left out of the lucrative deals being made , then this is not for you. If you like this excercise in bargaining out loud and social interaction
then this might just hit the sweet spot for you.

I find there's some strategy in deciding how long to wait to begin setting up your tiles and where, but beyond that, pretty easy -- get properties, match tiles and group them together. You also want to get properties/tiles valuable to your opponents, so you can sell them off or hold them hostage. That adds some nice interaction, dealings and timing.

I didn't think that I would like a pure trading game, but Chinatown proved me wrong. I do seem to enjoy some negotiation under the right circumstances. Since I haven't a lot of games of Chinatown under the belt, here are just some observations. They might change with further plays: 

* The rules of the game are dead easy to explain. Setup and rules explanation will take five minutes at most. And this is a game that can be played with casual gamers.

* Chinatown isn't for everyone. I had some complaints from players who didn't like the open and chaotic trading phase. I guess, they would prefer a more regulated setting for their trades.

* Most of the values can be calculated during the last two rounds. So Chinatown can become a little mathy in these. I'm not sure yet if this might kill the fun in future games.

It's hard to peg this game. I feel it really revolves so much on what you randomly recieve and just throwing down shops to make sure you recieve as much money early on as possible. I find it enjoyable though.

Great game if you wish to argue with your friends for 90 minutes.   Pure negotiation and lots of luck, there's no planning here, which is this game's downfall.   A lucky card draw can boost a poor salesman all the way into the winners circle.

I'm something of a Jack Nicholson fan, and Roman Polanski certainly has his moments.  So it was with little surprise that the opening scene had me giggling like a little girl.  Unfortunately, I took my sister/mother to see it.  While she liked it well enough, though that scene at the end hit a little close to home for her...oh, wait.  You mean the game Chinatown?  Oh, I hate that game.  People won't negotiate with me and it makes it painful (and long). Update: second game was less painful, but still not a favorite.

You need to have these one of those open-negociation game in your arsenal.

On my first game, I kep focusing on net gains from players to play my strategy and commerce but miserably failed to keep track of how much other were throwing in money in their exchange !

Essentially, need to make the right commerce with the right mixture of Lots, Commerce rights and money !

Easy to pick up and certainly much more fun with 5 players !

Controversial game for me. It's the only game that despite the fact i enjoyed it VERY MUCH,i give not such a good grade. That's because i think the element of luck is 50% and negotiation only 50%. The negotiations freedom is one of the best things i've ever played but the luck factor is EVERYWHERE in the game.

Wide open negotiation game.  You have money, tiles and markers (on the board).  You can trade any of these in any fashion you'd like.  The objective is to place identical tiles next to one another.  The game is amazingly simple for what it is.  And suprisingly, it moves along very quickly.  For some reason, I expected there to be more meat to it.  But overall I liked it quite a bit and am looking forward to playing again.

Players wheel and deal in building lots and businesses in Chinatown.  Players lay claim to lots which they can keep and develop as businesses (for money) or trade them away for cash/other lots/other businesses.  Very easy to pick up, and the trading is free-form but works very well.  Enjoyable negotiation game.

RATING: 5
This game is well-put-together, and seems to work fine with the official rules (I see no reason for the Westbank Gamers variant).  The amount of luck (which is fairly high) seems just about right-- enough to counterbalance the perfect information (and possible kingmaker problems) during the negotiation phase.  I just find the negotiation aspect to be too open-ended for my tastes-- there's definitely room for creativity when coming up with deals, but it's a little exhausting.  I prefer the more limited trading that goes on in games like Settlers of Catan and Civilization, or the very structured trading systems of Basari and Res Publica.

This is almost exclusively a pure negotiation game.  Board position can be deceiving, because whoever makes the best deals should win the game, regardless of how the board dominance appears.   I liked the fact that this game was distilled down to wide open wheeling and dealing, with just a little bit of extra stuff in there - but that's what sets it apart from the others.

RATING: 7
One of the best, when it comes to open negotiation. Since the trading phase is completely open, you get some really unusual deals all over the place, and it's hard to keep track of just how much money each person has. I'll always happily enter into a gamble deal: "I'll take your 2 restaurants, but I'll hand you any and all tea houses I draw for the rest of the game."

Game comes to it's weakest moment in the last two rounds - when you know that this action will literally give your opponent x money and make you y money, negotiation gets more difficult. Best if someone drives the game to its conclusion if people are getting caught up here.

one of the requirements for a good social boardgame (in my humble opinion) is INTERACTION ... otherwise, we may as well sit in front of our computer playing 'Hearts' with three pseudo 'people' .. or have that ubiquitous pack of playing cards laying red nine on black ten ... Chinatown offers interaction in spades ... pure negotiation, where anything .. that is, anything, goes .. trade cash, lots, shoppe tiles, put together a package and make an offer no one can refuse .. sure you can determine how much money one is going to make in a round, and subsequent rounds, but, just what are they going to give up (how much cash are they including in their deals) to obtain that desired goal ... this is the ultimate in wheeling and dealing .. great no-holds barred action across the table , and a  game whereby you help others to help yourself .. the final round always tends to peter out ... but the action up until then, is absolute WCW Mayhem ... one of the best pure negotiation games out there, and a guaranteed good time, to shake those shy turtles out of their shells .. highly recommend ...

Everyone likes, if not loves, this game; and I mean everyone! Even my dad, who hates board games, really got into the spirit of this one.  I do too, except it's the only game people want to play when I have them over.  The rules are simple: distribute, trade, build, make money.  It does a lot of the things Monopoly does but without the tedium.  I'll take a Dim Sum shop over Kentucky Avenue any day of the week. It's wheeling and dealing at its finest, and my gateway game of choice. Heck, it's one of my games of choice.

I upped my rating on this game after playing a few other trading games.  Chinatown is awesome because I feel it does a great job of keeping a player's focus on interacting with their opponents.  If you aren't trading nonstop, you're not winning this one.  The deals in our house can get a little crazy, yet everyone still has fun.  Play with this additional victory condition to encourage competition:  don't just track who won, but give special recognition to anyone who is in the 'millionaires' club'.  It made our group really step up their game :D

A notable exception to my dislike for negotiation-heavy games. Chinatown is the game I desperately wanted Monopoly to be; a mix of chance, positioning, and bartering. The negotiation side of things is prone to math-iness, since players can more or less figure out the value of another properties, which is my biggest complaint. Chinatown doesn't have anything revolutionary in the box, but its a near bulls-eye.

[3 plays] This game is possibly more enjoyable than it deserves to be.  But I do have a couple of problems with it.  First, it sometimes feels like the game is herding us all toward the optimal-efficiency solution.  Second, things can bog down, especially in the late game, when people get really focused on calculating the exact value of trades to everyone. It really takes away the wheeling & dealing, negotiating flavor that it seems like this game should have, when every time you try to make a deal, the other party gets out their revenue card, methodically figures up exactly how much profit you'll make from the deal, and offers a price that takes it all away from you.  All this can be avoided by dealing more aggressively earlier in the game, before anyone can tell the value of anything for sure.  But that just makes the game more luck-dependent.  And you can end up feeling that you spent an elaborate 2 hours answering the question "Can I draw X tile from the bag right now, because if so I win, and if not I lose."

A great social game based completely around table trading, with elements of area control & set collection. I like highly interactive games which get people talking a lot.

You may want to consider house-ruling it to limit the time available for negotiation in each round.

For some reason, all my friends love to play this game. Don't get me wrong, the game is solid fun, but that's not why they like it. They like it, nay, LOVE it, because they get to point out all the racist Asian crap that permeates this game.

"I own a laundromat! How very Asian of me," they say.

They have fun making deals, also. "Oh, look at me! I'm stingy and a penny-pincher. Just like an Asian!"

After we put the game up, my racist friends all shake their heads and say, "Man, that game was racist."

*****
Out of print, you must buy this game. Not for children, nor inexperienced gamers, this is a superb, absolutely pure negotiation game. Some luck in the draw, and it helps if players are ready to deal, but the skill lies in squeezing the deal. Maybe 6 rounds is a tad too long, players are doing the sums by the 5th round, but this is still a great game, with the winner often being a surprise. What I really like too is that the player left with several business tiles lying in front of it clearly cannot win, and deserves not to since they didn't trade them away.

Only had the opportunity to play Chinatown twice, in back to back games. I admit to falling in love with this game. So many crunchy decisions! So much angst! You may only succeed by jostling and elbowing your opponents as you fight your way to the victory. Lots of emerging gameplay in this title. People come up with the craziest offers and deals to try and sweet talk you out of your properties or businesses. 

One caveat, however, keep this title away from the meek hearted. There's so much negotiation in this game, that sometimes you just gotta hollar like at a fishmarket! Shrinking violets won't be able to succeed. 

Play this one with your nearest and dearest loud mouthed friends, who love to chat and laugh. Have a great time!

[b]Simple, wide-open trading game that is a classic of the genre.[/b]

PROS:
- easy to teach/low rules overhead - better for casual gamers
- nicely coloured and illustrated business tiles
- good value for what you get

CONS:
- values are static, so trading can be mathy
- the money is American, so it's all green; colored money would have been very helpful here
- sometimes the last two rounds feel like going through the motions: count income and split when making deals

After [b]2 plays[/b]. Negotiating game, used to be a 7 or an 8, but too repetitive and too lucky. It is still a good game and lots of people like it, but I find it loses some steam after the initial fun. 2006

It's been a long time since I last played this. I just bought it, figuring it would be a straightforward, strong trading/economic game for my younger niece and nephews. It works on that level, I guess. My [b]4th play[/b], I feel the same was as I did back in 2006. The set payout prices means a lot of deals come down to calculating exact incomes and splitting the difference. It's missed some of the gambling aspect that you'd get in a game like Bohnanza.

A free for all chaotic affair best suited for more than fewer players.  I generally dislike games which allow or generate an anything goes atmosphere.  This usually favors the quick and loud to get their way first.  In fact there are a few players in our group which refuse to play such games.  While I don't think Chinatown is the worse example, I would prefer a negotiation mechanic which would have some kind of a format so that everyone would be on equal footing.  I'ld like to try it again with the maximum number of players just to see how loud this gets.

Muy chulo, de negociar y comer orejas, familiar y de duración contenida. Muy interesante la mecánica de negociación con 3 tipos de recurso diferentes (edificios, tiendas y dinero) que permite que siempre haya cosas interesantes para mercadear. Seguro que saldrá mucho a mesa con novatos, primos, etc. Recomendable.

This is a good game, but I rate it down because it really only works if the different players have compatible haggling styles and compatible notions of what it means to be a "good sport". Incompatible haggling styles can easily double the length of the game (that's not an exaggeration), and incompatible notions about being a good sport can lead to annoyance or feelings of mistrust.

Hard to do better as far as negociation games go. It still suffers from a problem that plague any negociation game, namely, a player can do kingmaking easily if he doesn't correctly evaluate his stuff. Then again, in this game this problem doesn't seem to appear as much as in others. Also, there is a somewhat important luck factor, but you don't seem to notice it too much since you can greatly improve your situation with exchanges.

Elég egyedi, üzletelős cserélgetős játék. A szabályok pofonegyszerűek, a játék szépségét maga az üzletelés adja. Egyben talán ez a hátulütője is: nagyon kell hozzá a megfelelő társaság, mivel a játékmenet nem annyira szigorúan vezetett, mint más játékok esetében. Magukban agyaló, számolgatva elmerengő játékosoknak nem ajánlott.

Chinatown is a free-form negotiation and trading game. Quite unusually the values of the properties that are haggled over are entirely transparent to the players. You know exactly what a certain lot or business is worth to another player - with the sole exception of random future draws which in some cases may or may not increase the value even further.

This is a huge problem. Without uncertainty about what other players can do with what you're giving away there is no game left. All it is about is whether or not people do the math to determine the tile values, and if everybody does that (and it's not like that's a difficult thing to do; you can mostly even read it right off the player aid), it comes down to who draws the more lucrative lots and businesses.

Chinatown is a negotiation game. You can trade anything for anything which usually I don't like because I can't get my head around all the possibilities and it can make a game very long. However since it is such a pure negotiation game you don't have to do other things in your head which makes it ok.

Still, beware of AP players, If you can't go with your gut a little bit and feel like you have to min/max every situation you could potentially spend a long time on each turn.

I have always wanted to play Chinatown as I really do enjoy negotiation games and this one is always listed as one to try if you are in to that sort of stuff. I thought it was quite good in the end! I did find it a little spare, however, and I wish a couple more things were going for it. I'm a little concerned about the 'luck-of-the-draw' with the cards. There's always a chance that you can draw just the right cards to benefit your growth or just the wrong cards to be in a bad position for both growth and negotiation. Still, it works well for what it is and I have no serious qualms. Though, I enjoy 'Genoa' quite a bit more as my go-to negotiation game.

Chinatown is 6 rounds of pure trading.  The players trade tiles and also the gameboard locations on which to place them.  This is a pretty-good trading game.  Extremely fun game, plays quickly and is easy to teach.  Great game for non-gamers.  The price was high enough that I sold my copy... it ain't THAT good...  Traders of Genoa is better (see my rating comment there as to why), but this has a shorter play time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Unlike most trading games that I have played, Chinatown allows for multiple-party trading instead of the typical limit of 2 players trading (or trading with one active player).

There is, however, too much information, and trades are too mathematical.

I learnt so much about negotiation thanks to this game. To me, this game is almost a semi-cooperative game because you can not win by just looking after your own selfish interests.

Negotiations in its purest form! You can use this game to teach students how to negotiate in non-zero-sum conflicts. I like the simplicity of rules (although they are simple at the cost of some randomness influencing the outcome of the game) and I like the flow of this game. Every turn there is something new and the situation changes rapidly with almost every transaction. I think it's THE ultimate negotiation gateway game.

If you have some friends you like, the game with them is a great pleasure. And if you like negotation games you HAVE TO give Chinatown a try.

A negotiating game where anything can happen and all trades are valid. Very fun to play with 4 or more players.

Least ranked game in my collection but still the funniest trade game ever, pure negotiation in a quite easy game with tons of interactivity among players. I accept that Traders of Genoa is a bit better but Chinatown is far more accesible and after all a more funny game. Luck has a lot of importance and if you play with the wrong group it could end up being pretty boring, but with people who love this game and are good at trading and negotiation the game is a blast. It is also playable as a long filler and family game. I have the old ALEA edition which added a nice home rule that was forgotten in the new edition(connection to main streets necessary to start a new bussiness). All in all, a pretty good game that with the correct people turns out to be a fantastic experience.

Received in January 2013 in trade, in exchange for Big City.

This is a good negotiation game, but it's the kind of negotiation where you end up feeling you've never got a good enough deal. The last couple of rounds become a mathematical exercise which is less fun than the early and mid game. I prefer [thing=11][/thing] as a negotiation game, which incentivises generosity so that the trades flow more freely.

Traded away for Canal Mania and Raj in April 2015.

The ideas of PvP trading has always attracted me. But the actual games that I've tried over the years kept failing in this department. I started to think that perhaps trading just doesn't work the way I want to in games.. And then I tried Chinatown. This game is pure magic. I explain the rules in 2 minutes, and as soon as the game starts, all the trading "hell" breaks loose. What a fantastic game!

RATING: 3
Chinatown is Sid Sackson's Metropolis with all the good parts removed. The only thing happening here is making property/business/cash deals with your opponents. That's fine, but it means that the game will succeed or fail based on the strength of the trading. And the trading stinks. Why? Because there's no hidden information, and it's extremely easy to calculate or at least approximate the expected value of any deal. Trading games work much better when there's some mystery about how much the "traded thing" is worth to different players. There's no mystery here. Thus no one overpays for anything, and what's left is a simple game of "trade or use everything in your possession and try to draw good tiles and cards." There's some interest in that, but mostly it's an un-fun game.

after completing my trades, i sat there for 15-20 minutes for 6 turns doing absolutely nothing, while everyone else kept trading. Optimizing players slow this game to a crawl. Would gladly play again with a 10 minute time in which to trade. Without a timer...I would find someone else to play two player games with between turns. Higly unrecommended

One play with four, one with five. The core concept is pretty cool, negotiating for locations, businesses and cash. The issue is that players have so much latitude that things can get bogged down and ugly.

If I'm in the mood for negotiation, I'm probably going to stick with Quo Vadis.

6/2/2013: My favorite games are pure negotiation games. I haven't played this yet, but I predict I will rate it a 9.

4/11/2015: Finally (!) played this. Yes, it's a fantastic game—free form trading is the best form of trading in life or in a game. 

It's nice because the game has a discrete end point (6 turns), which means you optimize your trading for the medium term. You can win by deal-making for capital assets and de-focusing on revenue streams. Of course, with a long enough time period, the players with more land and buildings would win, but 6 turns keeps the game more trade-oriented.

It plays better with more players. With 3 it is kind of dull. Players’ aims and interests do not intersect. There is not enough conflict and not much to trade for.

Három fővel egy parti.

Látszatra és szabályolvasást követően nagyon sokat vártam tőle, ehhez képest kevésbé nyűgözött le.
Szép az új kiadás (a régit nem ismerve), bár a pénzt erősen figyelni kell, nehogy összekeverjük, a játék nem lett rövid, az alkudozás növelte az időt.
A legtöbb esetben tiszta volt, hogy mi mennyit ér, csak a partnert kellett erről meggyőzni. (pl: "Ha ezt elcseréljük, akkor te a hátralevő fordulók alatt 200-zal keresel többet, én 40-nel kevesebbet, tehát adjál 120-at, s így mindketten 80-nal járunk jobban a harmadik játékoshoz képest.")
Ez így túl steril volt, viszont eltérni az összegtől számára hátrányos irányba egyik partner sem kívánt.

Vajon milyen lehet 4-5 fővel?

(JAB Mars 2012) C'est un jeu intéressant pour sa dynamique dominante de négociation. Toutefois,ce n'est pas tout le monde qui aime jouer à un jeu seulement de négociation. On est dépendant des autres et ce n'est pas toujours évident de juger les offres de chacun. On ne veut pas se faire rouler, mais si les offres sont équivalentes, les joueurs se retrouvent avec un écart très minime. Ce n'est pas le genre de jeux qui m'intéresse absolument. Je suis moins friand des jeux d'argent.

Fairly straight forward, easy to learn.  Speculation and trade (between players).  Randomness is somewhat alleviated by the fact that you receive 2 more cards then you keep, thus selecting the ones you want, and you can always trade/exchange businesses (tokens) and lots with the other players.

Easily the best negotiation game I've ever played, partly because there are so few restrictions on what can be traded and how many partners can be involved in a trade. We often found ourselves jockeying for positions or tiles that we didn't need ourselves, but knew we could later trade as part of another deal with another player. I actually felt my brain knot up a couple times, as it can be quite tough to foresee all the possible implications of each deal. You've got to be willing to speak up and initiate deals, and remember that everyone has a price! Great fun!

Lowered it from 5 to 3 after the second play. To me it's too luck-driven. No negotiation skills can help you if you've got a bad hand in the beginning. This is the only game in the Alea series that I'm considering trading out.

Okay, negotiation games stress me out--how much is something worth to me or the other player? These types of games require assertiveness and a sense of brashness that are not present in most games. Chinatown has a lot of random elements, and the way the properties are acquired reminds me of Rhinelander. Placement of businesses is sort of like Acquire. However, the collecting and forming of sets of businesses reminds me of Monopoly. The theme is light, but the negotiating is heavy, sort of making this "Traders of Genoa-lite". Can be reasonably played in 45-60 minutes. Very easy to learn, but making the most of your negotiations is hard. I like this better than Genoa--less stressful. Rating: '7'.

Since this game is pure negotiation it is much more player-dependent than many other games. Since I play with a rotating set of players that means this type of game doesn't really shine for me.

It doesn't help that my single player was ruined by a player who began playing irrationally part way through ("I'll give you all my money for that useless tile") which turned it into a battle for second place.

I'd like to give another try one day because I find the total lack of structure somewhat fascinating (i.e. people who refuse to trade for something that is clearly (to me, at least) in their best interest because they are paranoid or conservative or whatnot).

The total lack of structure means there is room for some creative trades but in practice they seem pretty uncommon -- but perhaps that is a consequence of "lack of consistent set of players".

Very nice middle-weight negotiation game.  I prefer this to Genoa because it's even more open-ended--more about the negotiation and less about the rules.  It's perfectly possible to work out three-way trades, trade strange things and so forth.  Of course there is a random element--if I draw the tiles I want, I don't have to trade for them--but other than that, it's all about how well players can negotiate. (1 play)

What a great experience! Finally, this game really makes use of trading as a mechanic. Trading is actually the only game here. Compared to Bohnanza it is heavier, but more satisfying since everybody is trading at the same time. Compared to Genoa it is lighter, but more stream-lined. In Genoa you can try different strategies, but in the end it still comes down to trading efficiently. Chinatown does what it does so well I currently feel no need to play any other trading game.

Oh and did I say that the trading really feels like haggling in a crowded market place? The theme fits perfectly here :)

Probably the simplest and most fun negotiating game I've played to date. Get your property, get your tiles, get your money and...GO. Make two way deals, three way deals, a screw it I don't want your Laundry, give me that seafood! Chinatown brings the best and worst out of every one. I've never had anyone have a bad time while playing (at least not until the very end). Without the random year cards that were in the previous version this game can get stale by the last round. It's also not a game I'd play twice in a row but i'd pull it out on occasion/frequently enough to warrant it such a high score. It stands the test of time.

Wow, where to start?  This game may be one of the most simple games to explain with the most basic mechanics, but there is nothing simple about the negotiations that will erupt during this game.  Play time is also highly variable dependent on the types of players.  A timer might be a necessity.

Feb10:

I had avoided it forever. Mainly due to the statements of "It's all calculable". And really, they are more right than wrong. You can really calculate out what many of the deals are really worth.

However, there are more that still have that air of intangible. I think I will play with your unplayed building tiles hidden next time. I just need to find some tile racks to fit in the box.

The recent printing was just gorgeous. It was really easy to teach and made perfect sense. We got going, and the negotiations started flying. The interaction was fun and jovial. We all threw on some wacky accents just because.

I would recommend a timer, 5 minutes worked for our 4 player game. I always like the idea of negotiation games, but so many of them seem to fall a little flat. Genoa is too long. Bohnanza is great, but a little light. Quo Vadis is solid, but too abstract for most people. I think Chinatown hits a happy medium.

RATING: 8
initial rating 2 plays 5 players....

Like any "real" trading or negotiation game this will be very group dependant. I found this to be a very unique game, it felt a little like aquire just due to placement and building buildings but it is completely different. A pure negotiation game through and through where almost everything is up for trade. The real unique thing I found is that there are no turns at all. People get their placements and their buildings, everyone flips over which buildings they have and then WHAM! The race is on to get the best trades possible done before someone else undercuts you. 

The placements and buildings are handed out randomly forcing you to make the best with what you have and almost ensuring the best negotiater will win as bad placements and buildings can be overcome through trading to a large degree. A real blast with the right group, 5 being best I think but 4 would be good too. Lots of yelling and laughing and 2 or 3 people trying to deal with one guy all at the same time. 

It's true all info is open and that could be somewhat modified but it worked great for our groups. Some deals went longer by trying to calculate but mostly things were done more hastily and that way is certainly more fun. The last 2 rounds things are definetly "easier" to calculate and then you might try to work out the value and split it in half with the other trader, this was fine too. Players of relatively equal skill will be important as a weak player could ruin deals or make too good of deals killing the balance.

Some luck, a little chaos and only a little strategy but great tactics and a lot of fun really make up for this. Overall a very fun title and hard to beat for pure negotiation, I prefer this to TOG as its much shorter and more "fun", if I want a longer more strategic nego game I'll go for TOG or Die Handler. If you're playing this slowly and calculating everything I believe you're not "playing" the way it was intended; fast, furious will be fun, any other way, not so much so won't be for everyone. If you want full on interaction this is it!

RATING: 7
I love this game. The negotiations are really fun since everything is up for trade. There is almost no game mechanics here except for the end of round earnings from businesses. And here's the brilliance of the game, the entire game is driven by the players itself. Players create their own rules for trade with other players and determine the value of the trade. 

Be warned though, negotiations in this game can sometimes get out of hand and noisy so you might not want to play this in a place where your gaming group could stand out for being too loud. (kinda reminds me of those bargains and negotiations being done in a Chinese market). The game is also very heavily group dependant so gamers that don't like to negotiate may not like this game.

Chinatown is a negotiation game where the principal game play mechanism is trading randomly drawn board locations and set collection chits with other players in an effort to generate the most recurring income.  The constant interaction makes the game fun for a group of shrewd negotiators.  There is a lot of randomness due to the manner in which resources are allocated among the players, but the ability to trade means that the randomness should not dictate the winner.

This is a great trading game, easily my favorite in the genre. It's simple to learn and a lot of fun trying to cut the right deals. It can range from excellent with the right group to so-so if played with the wrong people(people who won't negotiate to be precise). Newbies can screw up pretty easily by giving away too much too soon. Considering it's simplicity & depth of play, this is without a doubt one of the best games ever!

I finally played this at a recent convention with 5 players all for the first time.  No one was overly thrilled with the experience, but at least 3 said they wanted to try it again with 3 or 4 players.  With 5 it happened (and seemed likely to reoccur) that at least one player is out of contention early on due to scattered tiles that have little appeal to other players, and lack of essential business tiles at key times for exploitation.

I played this for the first time in August 2010, it was one of the first games I ever played and I really liked, I played this again last Saturday and I still think it is a great negotiation game. The rules are very simple but the game can be lengthy if players allow long negotiations phases. I have had a blast every play and I totally recommend it for social gamers (as with all negotiation games it depends on the group). 

There is no hidden information in this game and that makes easy to calculate the profit of each trade, some people find this to be a problem but I like to see how well can I trade with this conditions. I prefer Genoa but this is a good game nonetheless.

The game always makes for a lively, loud and vigorous session, if you like negotiation games try it out!

Chinatown was in my top 10 games for a while. It was one of the first games I ever played and I do love negotiation games. I’m downgrading its rating as I don’t always want to play it, but I’m usually I’m willing to play so it´s now a 7.0

RATING: 7
In the increasingly crowded design space of modern board games, Chinatown occupies a place of its own as a lightweight pure negotiation game.  There is none of the delicious complexity of Genoa in this rule set, it's true, and normally that would be a turnoff to me.  Negotiation tends to insert a complexity of its own into any game which features it, though.

Relatively friendly to first-time players in that the valuations of most items are transparent.

Simple but ingenious and fun negotiation game. I imagine having a couple of games under your belt to get a feel for the value of potential trades without doing the sums to the nth degree would speed things up a bit. The ability to do rapid mental arithmetic is a help.

When you're in the negotiation mix it's a lot of fun, although depending on the card/tile draw there can be turns during which there isn't much of interest the others can offer that will help you much. On such turns you're likely to feel left out of things a little and it can thus drag a bit.

Only played this once so far. As there was only three of us it went quite quickly. The game itself was quick to learn and the rules simple enough. We did set a time limit of 10 mins to conduct all negotiation and trade, but we concluded our business in about 7 or 8 mins each round. 
I was interested in this game for a number of reasons one being anything goes in trade and the other being the social interaction. This game brings out a side of people that remains hidden in a lot of the time and I can see this game hitting one of two extremes, either very frustrating or incredibly fun. I had fun with my small group in our first play, time will tell how this game will fit in my list and how often it hits the table. ... so far it's a keeper.

Chinatown is a wonderfully satisfying experience that combines various random mechanics as well as the unpredictability of the human element of trading. I'm not generally a fan of games with open negotiation and factors that don't allow me to control my own fate, but this game is a blast!

Bohnanza on steroid.

Great negotiation game. But have several issues. First, there's math here, LOTS OF EM. If you want to win, you better count your spending and earning. I lost because giving my opponent 10.000 discounts, which is sucks. 

Second, if you're an introverted players, you will certainly not enjoying this game. You have to be proactively sees prospects and persuades people. Other than that, you're stuck.

Third, with many things traded, sometimes you may feel the deal is one sided and then you regret it later. Well that's a part of the game, but, back to first issues, with 3 different aspects being traded, lots of counting will be used here

Decent game, but it'll take the right crowd. We teetered on the brink of cold calculation of future returns at a couple points, which if taken to excess would suck all the life out of the game. Location tiles and shop tiles are all a random pull from a bag, although you do get some choice in what to keep. If you fail to get anything directly benefiting yourself or of trade value for another player, it can be a big setback. 

Excellent quality on the reproduction, no surprise at all seeing as Z-Man's name is associated with it.

My group really wanted to get a hold of this game so last year we bought a copy. Well we got to play it twice and then it began to collect dust. I recently got to play it again and it is a nice little negotiation game. We played with the rules as written and it was enjoyable. I was suprised the game moved as quickly as it did since negotiations are open for as long as players want to deal. It does seem to be important to keep your options open during the early game. All game information is public, except for money, so everyone can see the impact of every potential trade(however, that's not to say that everyone actually sees the impact). A game that I'd like to see come out a few more times.

Chinatown is an almost pure negotiation game. The board is made up of six grids of squares, each square on the board having a unique number. There is a deck of cards - one card for each square. There is also a bag of tiles with various businesses (Antiques, Restaurant, Photo, Take-Out, etc.) ranging in value from 3-6.  On each turn players draw cards and keep a few (depending on number of players and game phase) and claim ownership of the spaces they keep. Then business tiles are drawn from the bag (again, depending on # of players and game phase). Once drawn, the negotiations begin! Players can trade any number of spaces, tiles, cash, and so on to get the combos they want. Tiles are then placed. Adjacent tiles of matching businesses are worth more, when enough adjacent tiles are built to match the value number, that is considered a "complete" business and pays the most. Then income is paid out and you do it again. Whoever has the most money after 6 rounds wins.

Negotiations are obviously at the heart of the game. In the first and last rounds, the negotiations are weaker because the board is either too empty or too committed to do much, but the middle rounds are filled with negotiating possibilities. It seems quite possible that a player with a number of lucky draws could run away with the game without having to negotiate much. Whether or not you enjoy the game depends on how you like negotiation. If you love negotiation, there's a lot to like here. If you dislike negotiation there's almost nothing to like. One aspect that people may not enjoy is that it is very difficult to tell who is in the lead and by how much.

Feels like Acquire + Big City with the negotiations of Genoa thrown in for good measure. The result is an easy game both to teach and play and does so in under an hour. 

UPDATE: 2.15.11 
I've somewhat cooled on Chinatown. If you get the right plot/shop draws early on its much easier for you to snowball your way to victory. Supposedly the negotiations mitigate this but a good player isn't stupid enough to trade away a good combination of plots/shops. Chinatown does play quickly but if I'm going to suggest a trading game it will be Genoa.

A negotiation game.  My daughter and wife love this game, so I will never get rid of it.  Here's the thing.  At a certain point in the game, you can calculate what each tile is worth to you and your opponent.  That brings negotiation down to a screeching halt.  You will only get very even trades and if one player is winning, no one will trade with you.  For me, it doesn't work at all at three players, which represents most of our plays.  Maybe my love for the game will go up if we begin playing at four players.

Chinatown reminded me of Acquire, which I did not expect. You have fewer turns but draw more tiles from the bag. Instead of spending your money on stock, you can spend it negotiating with other players in order to get the tiles and spaces you want. Instead of big payoffs from mergers, you receive steady income from businesses, which ramps up when each business reaches a certain size. Everything is public, so you can see what you have that might be valuable to the other players and vice versa. You spend six turns making deals against the randomness of the draw and see who made the most money. I rather liked Chinatown. Does a lot with a little, and plays in about an hour.

Update (3 plays): Unfortunately, I think the first play is the best play, because people only have a decent feel for what they're doing, rather than an exacting approach that takes into account all future income. In the early game, there is some uncertainty about trading because you don't know who will draw what and change the picture. But even then, I find that players can be a bit disingenuous. I'm willing to articulate exactly what's at stake on either side of a trade. Other players tend to present fuzzy, incomplete, or irrelevant math. Rarely on purpose, of course, but still. 

Reading the comments on this game, my guess is that quite a few players don't/can't eyeball a trade and quickly determine it's value. For them, working through future income seems like some kind of lengthy analysis that goes against etiquette. I guess ignorance is bliss. 

I'm downgrading Chinatown to a 6. I think it's my first pure negotiation game, and there was a real spark for me before each trade involved the entire game-arc. It's sad that the first play is the best play. Definitely need to try Genoa. 

Final Update: My rating slides with each play, and I'm out of patience. I now strongly believe this to be a flawed or problematic design. During my last play, I actually watched the game get worse before my eyes as new players figured out how to calculate the value of tiles. For a brief moment, there's an illusion that you can make deals in good faith based more on a gut feeling of what it "seems" to be worth. Once that illusion is crushed, the game goes out the window. 

The main issue here is that [b]overwhelmingly[/b], people don't WANT the deal-making to be as deterministic as it is. So you basically have a camp of fans who outright ignore the way the game works, or who make a game out of misrepresenting the way the game works (swindling) and then you have everyone else who does the math. Once you've played a couple of times, I can't imagine that you'd want to be at the table in mixed company, regardless of your angle on the game.

I'm not sure how I feel about this game yet. The negotiation is a bit odd with so much open information, several times it deteriorated into calculating the benefits each would get and splitting the difference in the deal. Although there is lots of opportunity for more speculative trades as well.

I don't think we know how to play this properly yet, so the 6 is a lower limit for sure.

I'm bumping up my initial "6" rating to a 6.5 after two widely separated plays. Chinatown is/can be fun, even uproarious, but, like most/all negotiating/tradiing/voting games, it is prone to, even predicated on, a metagame that not everyone will enjoy and that can easily leave someone on the outside for little reason other than interpersonal factors only semirelevant to the game. In my last play, the guy who probably played "best" in the abstract--was most aggressive with trade proposals, had the best sense of the tradeoffs--ended up coming in last because he came off too "hot" and made it so no one wanted to trade with him. Not a game I would recommend for every audience and situation, but, as advertised, it is almost pure negotiation, which is worth something.

I have the large-box Z-man edition from several years ago. I don't object to the size much, but I'm not a fan of the money, which comes in odd denominations that are easily confused for one another from a distance (because they're all green-on-white "simulations" of US bills). This may make money easier to hide, but it's also easy to make a mistake. I think I will trip poker chips next time even though it will be harder to keep the amounts secret.

Like any other negotiation game, you have to make sure you're playing with an appropriate group for it to be any fun.  It's hard to not compare this to Traders of Genoa, since they're both Alea negotiation games.  I'd have to say that I like this a little more, mainly because of the shorter playing time.  I guess there are more options in ToG, and there's a huge amount of luck in Chinatown (because of random tile/card draws, which are much more important than the card draws in ToG), but it seems manageable.  I can see what others have said about being able to calculate what everything's worth, especially at the end, but that doesn't bother me too much.  I really enjoyed the game - the graphic design is pretty good and the board and pieces are attractive.  I'm not sure that this is worth the crazy prices it's going for, but I'm glad to own it and would gladly play it...with the right group, that is.  I didn't find the negotatiation aspect to be as aggressive as other games, however.

I enjoyed playing the new version more, but this was probably because of the people I played with.  The new version's box is way too big, as the game has very few components (thus meaning it is way overpriced), but for reprinting a highly-coveted OOP game, I can understand.  The board itself is very nicely done and the business tiles are nice, thick and sturdy.  Overall I like how this version looks better.

I don't remember the business outlook cards from the other version too much, so I can't comment on that.  Ultimately I think I like other negotiation games better.  There is a huge amount of luck riding on the card and tile draws, and the end of the game ends up being pretty unexciting as people just collect money, and most tiles and cards drawn are of little value.

Very simplified trading game. Its even easier to learn than Big City (which uses the same plot-of-land mechanism).

The random tile reward was a little iffy, but I suppose it injects some uncertainty into the end game.

Wide open negotiations aren't for everyone, because there are people who want more control and less chaos and intuition. That's why you really need the right crowd for Chinatown. How buildings and shops are coming to play are good mechanisms, but it's a bit lame that there's no variable in profits. Now you can count open all the values of all the trades which isn't realistic and makes the game longer. The non-Alea box is terribly oversized.

What is with this game?

The sandbox negotiation round is about as fun as it gets in gameplay for me. It's wonderful and enjoyable, but the game has a serious flaw. Others have discussed it more eloquently, but the problem, ultimately, is that the more you play, the less enjoyable the game becomes. The game boils down to who can make the best and quickest calculations of the value of the deals in negotiation. That is what this game is -- who is better at mathematics.

Also, what is the incentive to take risks beyond a certain point in the game? One example: by the middle of the fourth round, I had three completed businesses on the board, passively earning me $270,000 per round. With two-and-a-half rounds left (more than a third of the game), why would I want to make any deals unless I drew something spectacular? And if I did draw something spectacular, why would anyone else want to deal with me?

Chinatown is a tremendous amount of fun -- I enjoy it -- but it is slightly flawed.

This had the potential to be an excellent trading game, but some things got in its way.

This is a game of negotiation and trading. The goal is to make the most money in 6 rounds by building 'shops'. This involves getting ownership of adjacent locations on a grid and then getting matching sets of tiles into those locations which will earn money at the end of each round. 

This is the best negotiation game I've played. There are two things about this game that really stand out. I really like that there are three distinct but interconnected resources (tiles, locations, and money) and that you can make any sort of trade deal that you can manage involving any combination of resources (including your $'s, which are your victory points). I also like that you can deal with anyone and you can make deals involving multiple parties. It is basically completely open negotiation and trading which is refreshing and gives a sense of control and flexibility not found in other negotiation games.

A pointless game.  The value of a given tile is fairly easy to determine.  The group determines the appropriate "price" for a given tile.  In our group it was 50% of the expected value, but it could be any arbitrary percentage.  The group will trend towards that percentage for all trades.  So it comes down to who gets better tiles.

There needs to be more ambiguity in the value of the tiles.  For example, "Modern Art" has a range of values, and it can be hard to determine that value.  A game like "Ra" makes it even more difficult to determine appropriate value.  Without ambiguity, the game is a simple mathematical exercise.

I guess if I was playing with mental weaklings, I could take advantage of their inability to make the appropriate calculations, but I played this game with strong players, which was, as I stated right at the beginning, completely pointless.

I don't like full information negotiation games in general: since everything can be calculated, you are only negotiating in the hopes that somebody makes a mistake. Granted, you don't know which buildings / businesses are going to appear the next round, but that's just a layer of odds to add to your calculations.
Rather than all open information, I would've rather seen negotiations with non-symmetric information where different players know different things (see Hab & Gut for a non-negotiaton game using this mechanism). 

The new version looks gorgeous, but has one *gigantic* flaw: all the denominations look exactly alike apart from a very small number on the card. In a game where money is constantly changing hands this  means mistakes are bound to happen.

This game is definitely showing its age.  The grid-like board is a little odd, and the fact that it's not a pure grid just means that the numbered plots can be harder to find.

It has a really simple rule set, and that's part of what is a bit frustrating about the experience -- it is difficult to teach people how to play it.

Also, you MUST play a game like this with the right people.  It is a trading/negotiation game.  As a result, it's hard to figure out the right group with which to get this to the table.

Greatly overrated.  Trading game where the value of most everything can be (tediously) calculated and actual haggling obliterated by intellectually rigorous players.  It then just devolves in a grind where which tile you randomly pull out of the bag is determinant.  It's cute that a slick negotiator can sometime get a small edge, but that doesn't redeem the game (which there is precious little of).

It's an acceptable trading game where player trade properties and building types. Players try to make larger groups of buildings to get more money.

I think the puzzling part of the game is trading. Yes people have money, which should make trading easier, but in our group, most people try to trade items instead, that would prevent the necessity to calculate the future income of their investment to know how much the item are really worth.

This lead to a puzzle where you needed to make chains of trade to be able to get what you want. It reminds me of math trades and I imagine players geek enough would have set up a math trade with a computer and collect want list of each player.

RATING: 8
An excellent, simple and elegant negotiation game.  I'd recommend this & Bohnanza for a light to mid-weight negotiation game with Traders of Genoa (also great) for a deeper negotiation/trading game.  I tend to favor this game with less than perfect information or a Hidden Goal variant (i.e. - end game bonus reward for businesses on a certain street), especially with serious players.  Another option is to keep tiles secret and reveal only when offering to trade or placing on the board.  This way, there is less perfect information.

Admirable but flawed attempt at a medium-weight negotiation game.  Too much chaos in the card and tile draws between rounds, and the payoffs are too fixed and calculable to engender truly interesting dealmaking.  I would rather play Traders of Genoa (on the heavier side) or Dragon's Gold (on the lighter), so I don't see myself playing this much, if ever again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun and very social game with nice components. There is a lot of satisfaction in demanding a really expensive deal on an item that your competitor desperately wants. For most players, their dodgy used car salesmen side comes out as they try to describe a deal beneficial to them as as a great opportunity for their victim.

The subtleties can take a few rounds for new players to work out and playing two games in a row to give them an equal shot at victory feels too repetitive.

Your extended family keeps dying and bequeathing you parts of the quarter called "Chinatown", while, at the same time, you keep compulsively buying whole shop outfits without knowing what shop they are exactly for. Those you have to match up to bigger shops of the same type, backstabbing your fellow players into dealing you the stuff they would certainly need but you need more for stuff you don't need but they need even less.

Finally got to play this classic negotiation game. Unfortunately for me, negotiation is one of my most disliked ingredients in a game. I don't like doing it. I'm not a dealmaker or a haggler. I'm a "let me make my purchase and be on my way" guy. A mark, if you will. In the real world I'll gladly take a price hit if it means ending the transaction sooner.

Chinatown, however, isn't too bad. Unlike Traders of Genoa, there's not a whole lot of faff on top of the trading and haggling that you also have to deal with. It's a lot more straightforward and, for me, easier to value the transactions. A lot of my gaming pals love Genoa, and while I certainly recognize it's a good game, it's not one I particularly enjoy playing. Chinatown, in my opinion, fills a very similar niche but with more zazz. I wonder if I can convert them?

Chinatown has nothing much to do with Chinatown (the theme is completely bolted on) but everything to do with free trading. That's where the joy of this game resides: in all the sneaky, backstabbing, irrational deals that will keep happening, over and under the table. Of course, like all free form negotiation games, it needs the right group of players and there will be some opportunities for king making but you should nonetheless try it out. IMPORTANT INFORMATION: *keep the tiles and money you own hidden and lie through your teeth about them or deal values will be too transparent and suck the fun out!* Don't let the dry board fool you: Chinatown is lots of fun and a great game for conniving bastards. Intrige, however, remains the undisputed king of this category.

Received for Pocket Battles Elves and Orcs in Essen 2013 MT. An excellent trading game - this is a lot of fun but also a lot of work. Lots to think about here, I am very pleased we got this.

Much lighter than I had expected, but still a pleasant surprise.

Has similar aspects to Acquire, but plays much more like Big City. Add trading to the mix, which I do so love, then you make a game of endless possibility. The trading knocks out the random element for the most part.

I played the new edition, but plan to break out my original and see how the bonus cards play out and whether to include them in future plays or not, and also to see how the different layout effects the game (I suspect not much).

Classic Alea.

Fantastic negotiation game.  The rules are simple enough to learn in two minutes, and when everything is completely up for grabs, everyone is deal breaking like we were in... well, Chinatown.  The board looks absolutely beautiful when the game is done, too.  (I was lucky; I picked up my Alea copy for a song...)

Chinatown is a negotiation game where you are randomly given city blocks and start with some money.  You are then allowed to make deals to buy or trade locations.  You then get business tiles that you can place.  You can buy, trade or sell business tiles from other players as well.  There is a final placement of tiles and an income phase.  

If you like light economic games with heavy negotiation this is for you.  

This is not a family weight game.  I would say it is just beyond family weight but still relatively light for most gamers.

It needs .... something.  I really enjoyed this game the first few times I played it, but it really loses something with repeated plays.  It's just too easy for someone with a logical approach to things (and hey, we're gamers, that's about 95% of us!) to predetermine the actual value of trades, thus making the luck of the draw in pulling tiles and property control the outcome almost entirely.

Per BGG admin: about as simple (and elegant) as an (interesting) negotiation game.

Not as good as Traders of Genoa, but easier to play and with a shorter playtime. Therefore, more accessible to all students.

Only immediate downside: Not 2 players.

Z-man edition seems preferable. (see Ender's review)

2003 Weeell, I would like this game to be good but it's only average.  It's too transparent, too easy to evaluate trades hence trading beyond the first couple of rounds (of six) involves no risk and outcome is all down to ones luck in drawing cards/tiles.  Fewer players actually seems better with more resources each to banter with.

Played once. Nice trading/negotiation game. I'm generally not very good in this kind of free-form negotiation (I'm deliberating too much and so the impulsive players have already set the tone), but it works well.
The end-game is a bit anti-climactic as there are only marginal gains left, no big payouts, so the dealing becomes marginal as well. Still, would very much like to play again.

Initial rating; will probably go up. We love negotiation games but our first time through was only so-so. We played again immediately, but with the same players and mood, the second game was much the same as the first. We much prefer Sheriff of Nottingham or Genoa to this because a negotiation game without hidden information is just a math exercise.

Played this on New Year's Eve 2015 with Erin's parents and my mother. It works well as a social/drinking game with an extremely simple rule set. It's sort of difficult to explain if you haven't played it before, but once you have, this game can be explained to newbies in 5 minutes. I like the bits (I really appreciate no paper money), and the plastic discs are preferable to cardboard chits, IMO. Depending on the group, I could see this game being anything from neatly regulated to total chaos. Our group was closer to the former, with a few rivalries being formed in the process. I felt like I had no chance of winning, but actually came out to being a close second because of a strong final round. I LOVE THIS GAME. If you like negotiation games, you need to have this in your collection. If you don't like negotiation games, this game probably won't change your mind. However, for what it's worth, it's the best pure negotiation game I've ever played.

After a second game, I can see how players can get screwed with bad location cards, and how others can get lucky with great location cards. In other words, if someone gets lucky by receiving great positions (positioned closely together) and is able to negotiate well, they are most likely going to beat a person who negotiates well, but doesn't get any good location cards. That's sort of unfortunate, but should be expected in this game. That doesn't take away from the game for me. Of course, the tile pulls are totally random too, but tiles seem to be easier to negotiate for than positions. I've lost both times I've played this game (mainly due to unfavorable location cards), and I still LOVE it! 

Update 3/21/15: Played with Haren, Blaine and Tyson. This was the first time to play with friends. The game had the the same sort of "serious" tension, which I like. It's not lighthearted, but it's still fun! After playing it with both family and friends, I don't really have a preference either way.

Nearly pure negotiation, the purity only somewhat tainted by the draw of the tiles.  It is an excellent game.

Although I am not fond of negotiating games, this is not a bad occasional activity. That said, in negotiation games you perform as well as your opponents let you. If you have a winning reputation, you don't get much favors. So much for chances. Still I did win last time, that is because of the big luck factor in this game. The order in which the tiles come out is unpredictable. If you draw the right ones and the type your opponents focus on don't come out until last round. So not really great this game.

Finally got my first play in and I've gotta say it was a lot of fun, heaps of table talk lots of deals , I think I would enjoy the game at 5 pleyers more than 5 as people would be closer. 
Our last round was a little bit lame though as there was really nothing to trade of value.

If you're into negotiating games, this should be high on your want-list if you don't own it yet. Bought the reissue immediately after first play. Easy rules, explained in a minute. Enough depth to be a gamers game though. And Tons of Fun. Rating WILL go up if it stays this good after multiple plays.

The purest negotiation game I've played.  If you like negotiation I highly recommend it as it's a great design.  The play is straight-forward but you'll need to use your guile and get into as many (profitable) deals as possible in order to win.  UPDATE: knocked down another half a point as I don't really look foward to playing this.  Played with 3-players and it was god-awful (not enough buying and selling chaos for my taste).  Would rate as 3 with 3 players.

good negotiation game.  i think i might prefer container.

*******

Container is far more fragile and only can really play with people that can absorb how everything works.   this is more accessible.  Playing with a good group can add a couple of points to the rating. 

If playing with gamers that are fairly chintzy when it comes to trading, this will fail miserably (same as Wealth of Nations).

RATING: 7
OK negotiation game and can be an enjoyable game for non-gamers.  Chinatown was one of the first eurogames that I played way back in the early 2000s...

A problem I have with the game, is that it is relatively easy to calculate the expected future value of a trade due to the open information presented in the game (i.e. payoff matrix for groups of like business tiles).  The question then becomes, what is the "group think" discount rate and just how much of my gains do I have to give up to complete this trade?

This problem of readily calculated payoffs gets worse as the game nears the end.  So, fun first couple of plays, less fun thereafter.

Nice looking game, and good fun, with tons of negotiation, but I think I'd prefer to get Genoa. Perhaps if the negotiation itch is still there and I want another game like it I'd end up getting this.

Though of course, if the price is right...

And the price was right, and I still don't own Genua, so quite happy with it!

After my first play with only 3 players, I know why this is always listed as a recommendation for me here on the Geek.  The best sign of a good game - after every deal made, every person sat smugly back and thought, "I really got the better of them on that one."  And then in the end, the final scores were 1.3 million, 1.29 million, and 1.26 million.  Pretty close scores for such a back and forth game.  Really enjoyable.

I dislike negotiation games, and this one is pure negotiation. Draw some tiles, then everyone talks at once, scrambling to con someone into giving them the tiles they need. If Bob has the tile you need, and Jim needs that tile too, you better talk louder and faster than Jim, and hope you have something to offer Bob that he needs more than whatever Jim is offering (which mostly comes down to luck of the draw). Evidently, there are a lot of gamers who consider that sort of thing fun. I am not one of those gamers.

I can see why this one's a classic, lots going on here.  I think this one really depends on the group you play with, though, people have to be willing to deal, and it can be daunting for beginners to grasp what a fair deal is.  However, after one play, that becomes pretty clear.  This is the game that Monopoly should be.

Játékostársaim az első játék (felelőtlen bartelezés) után nagyon óvatosak lettek. Gyakorlatilag megakadt a játék. Sajna egyenlőre nem tudok neki többet adni.
Update: Bebizonyosodott, hogy nem működik a mechanizmus. Túl sok benne a szerencse. Ha nem sikerül (mint ahogy általában nem sikerül) jó helyre húzni és így zsaroló potenciált kialakítani, akkor gyakorlatilag kiesel a játékból. A probléma ott van, hogy egyszerre mindig kb. 3 embernél kell, hogy legyen megfelelő - bizniszre alkalmas dolog. Na ez az ami hosszú távon kizárt.

This is hands down the best negotiation game out there. 

The only Cons if I really tried to look for them is it is theoretically possible for someone to grab the exact tiles and lots to not need to negotiate. There is a slight bit of luck, but that luck can usually be mitigated by making smart trades, the more people the more other people can downplay that minuscule amount of luck.

Otherwise the game as it usually plays out is extremely interactive and just straight up tense negotiation.

With the right group, the open negotiation of Chinatown can be great. The rules are simple - draw lots and shops and try to form groups of similar shops - so the players can focus on finding deals that are mutually beneficial. However, I also share the concern of many others, who point out that the benefits can be calculated towards the end, limiting the scope of negotiation and reducing the game to luck of drawing the right tiles.

It is very possible to calculate the exact potential worth of any asset in any configuration. Not only does it slow down the game to an excruciating length, but it also solves it, sucking all the interest away. So you're basically in this weird configuration where you need to frustrate the players by setting arbitrary limitations (like a timer or no calculator allowed) for the game to work.

Pas mon type de jeu du tout. Je n'aime pas trop les jeux de négociation, et celui-ci n'est que ça. Il faut lire le jeu le plus rapidement possible afin de maximiser les chances de voir nos offres être acceptées. Il faut être plus persuasif que les autres, ou alors fin calculateur. Parfois on a le sentiment de n'avoir rien à offrir, et on regarde passivement les autres joueurs transiger, en se disant qu'un tel se fait avoir... En fait, ce sont les joueurs qui font le jeu; sans eux, pas de jeu.

Je n'ai rien contre la pige de tuiles, mais quand chaque tuile est unique, la part de hasard est un peu désagréable... 

On a observé qu'à y rejouer souvent, ce jeu risque d'être plus appréciable. Peut-être, mais comme bien d'autres (meilleurs) jeux!

(After 2 Plays) 10/12/16: I love that Chinatown takes the best mechanic of Monopoly, and turns it into a game with the trading. I have always loved the trading in Monopoly, so to have a game centered solely on that is awesome. The only real negative to the game is the fact that it can bog down if someone is counting out every possible deal. I understand the math isn't so hard to figure out, but I have played with people who will work out each trade and refuse to trade unless they are getting the substantially better deal. I like this game to be played quickly and freely. sure I may make some boneheaded trades, but I had fun doing it and taking a stab at possibly hitting a homerun with a deal.

Awesome game of pure negotiation to get ahead.

Made a few modifications to the rules for sake of ease.  
-I teach the game where we do not shuffle the cards after each round.  Annoying to get the same card you just discarded in the previous round.  Only after all the cards have been played through do we shuffle the deck.
-Also, I teach the game to have everyone hold onto their property cards and trade them accordingly with negotiations instead of discarding them into the box.

Chinatown is a super fabulous game about the bare essence of business and negotiation. Chinatown is a prime example of the technical term of "game theory" and waging the decision making questions: What happens if I take this action or make this offer, then what are the consequence? How will the other player react?  Chinatown is a great game of the high mindedness of negotiation. 

Warning:  do not play with "sensitive" players that could easily feel cheated during the negotiation  play. 

As of this commentary, the game is not in stock, but is expected to be in print in 2018. Check the publishers website. Beware of the high prices and fakes  in the secondary market.

Chinatown is a functionally simple game. The board, cards, and tiles are really just to provide a framework and context for open negotiations, the heart of its gameplay. The free-form nature of the negotiations are similar to Bohnanza and the spirit of Cosmic Encounter, so if you dislike those games Chinatown is probably not for you.

ZMan's reissue is graphically a huge improvement over the Alea original. My only wish was that the game was set further in the past, somewhere near the end of the 19th century. Then it would have been more historically accurate.

Chinatown turned out to be everything I'd heard about it, which was exactly what I was looking for. Its so nice when something actually meets your expectations!

I place Chinatown just one or two notches behind The Traders of Genoa, and mostly because a player can get hosed by a terrible lot draw, but hey... that's Chinatown.  And I love how easy it is for new players to understand its goals.  This game has exactly one trick -- almost everything is up for negotiation -- and it plays that one trick almost perfectly.

Still, in a knifefight, Traders wins.  But just barely.  And there's definitely room in my library for both of these gems.

To me a definition of a perfect 10 for a board game is that you can't wait to play it again. And to me Chinatown represents this perfectly. It doesn't get played very often because of a pretty strict player count but when does get played, it is always a blast.

I love these trading/negotiating games and this is certainly the purest and the best.

Good game, you need to work with other people to get what you need while trying to give up as little as possible.

RATING: 6.5
The game does a great job at what it is, a simple negotiation game that relies on the basics, with no unnecesary complexities or adornments. The luck of the draw is mitigated and it is secondary to negotation. Still, you cannot negotiate out of certain bad luck scenarios.

With public information, it's very easy to calculate the benefit both parties will get from a certain exchange. That usually leads to split the benefits 50%-50% and means that those who are lucky enough to draw the most valued business tiles and places are potential winners.

Some time limit is needed for each negotiation round. 4-5 minutes worked fine for us.

The strategic/tactic content is very light. You can even talk about "push your luck" instead of tactic. You place tiles and do deals hoping that you will be able to draw or negociate similar tiles next to those, and you can take more or less risks.

On a personal level, I don't enjoy negotiating in real life, and also not in games. It's fun during some turns, but then I become bored of it. And I like it even less when you know the real price of whatever you're selling/buying (and you will with open information). I quickly become frustrated if I don't get the real value from something. I think I will enjoy it much more with secret information, but I don't know if the game will work that smoothly.

Pretty much every aspect of Chinatown screams 'hate me' to the modern gamer. It's random, loud, chaotic and relies on a degree of co-operation not easily come by in my game group. There is potentially a ridiculous runaway leader problem, and players who take it too seriously may open a profit-loss book to the boredom of the rest of us.

But, from deep within this, comes the beauty of the theme. You can almost believe that all this shouting and chaos was how whole blocks of Chinatown were founded. There's certainly a great stock-market feel to the whole thing. And, out of the layers of ridiculousness, a great game is formed. Very much needs the right group to make it work, though.

ZMan edition with very attractive bits. The new board is huge.

Player pay-out cards use red vs black text to distinguish different information. This is a stupid piece of design, but it's easy to create a colourblind version.

The game is mostly structured haggling, with a small amount of risk management. Fun with the right people, but all players need to speak-up.

Editorial Mode On:
A good game which allegedly upsets people by portraying Chinese immigrants as stereotypes. If this game is the worst thing in your world, well, you need to read newspapers... what idiocy... it also shows Chinese immigrants becoming financially successful business owners - I suppose that's bad too?

Trading and negotiation game with open informations (expect for money). I think they got the trading aspect right. Sometimnes, you may want to make a deal with player A just for getting into a better position when negotiating with player B. That's cool. Luck may be a decisive factor - doesn't bother me. I imagine that the sweet spot for this game is 4 or 5 players. 

Altogether, I have to say that the game was a bit dragging. Use a timer?

[b]Chinatown[/b] was sold via auction 11/5/15.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Yes I traded this game, but not because it isn't a good game. Essentially Lords of Vegas is a bigger hit with my family so Chinatown left our collection (although now that I'll have more space for games I may seek out another copy). What sealed the deal is we enjoy the amount of randomness introduced into LoV due to the takeovers and card flip (which determines payouts) so you never have perfect information. If you play Chinatown with the wrong crowd (well to me at least since I prefer playing fast and loose) Chinatown can devolve into a math exercise with people calculating exactly what their $ gains will since there is no way to mess with peoples buildings. So did it really stand the test of time? Since I would always be willing to play a game I'd say yes, just because a game is no longer in my collection doesn't mean I don't enjoy it.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- A pure negotiation game that works extremely well in a family setting.
- Very easy to teach, clean rule set and you are engaged the whole game (there isn't any down time).
- I will mention that the game can get pretty intense because everyone is negotiating at the same time. (We slowed it down a bit so my daughter (9) wouldn't get overwhelmed.)
- Production is good (although I'd prefer wooden discs to the plastic ones) and I appreciate the much smaller box.
- Not sure if I'd play this with less than 4, I think it would fall flat.

I was very happy when whole family enjoyed Chinatown. Up to this point we have played Lords of Vegas, but I'd been a bit weary of introducing a pure negotiation game because there isn't any luck involved, whereas in Lords of Vegas you have lots of die rolling which can swing the game in some unexpected ways. Because of that fact I definitely think there is room in our collection for both of these games, depending on what kind of mood we're in.

Both games are great fun, but the one thing Lords of Vegas has over Chinatown are those insane die rolls when everything is on the line and you could lose a huge casino to an opponent. However; I think Chinatown offers a more exciting negotiation environment because you are negotiating not only for the lots, but also the different business types which means you usually have something everyone else at the table wants.[/i]

RATING: 6
Trading/Set collection game, simple. Businesses are only worthwhile in sets of 3/4/5/6. There's less luck than Settlers (I think), but the trades are harder to evaluate.

You are not (simply) trading one resource card for another like Settlers, but trading various combinations of building sites, businesses to put on those sites and cash. Future promises are allowed, but non binding (so people don't try to make them, paper they're written on etc.).

After 2 games, groupthink says: it's easier to make sets of tiles than building sites; also, all things being equal, 5/6-tiles are worth more than 3/4-tiles, because ultimately that's where the big money is.

The reason I traded it away is that it plays very similarly every time. And each turn is a lot like the last. After a few games it was very easy to value everything, and from that point forwards it was clear the games were being decided by luck of the draw, so I stopped playing it.

4-5 Players, Preferably 5. Can also play just as well at 6 with house rule



*****House Rules*****

1) Business tiles are kept face-down and secret. A player can reveal them if he wishes, but doesn’t have to.

2) Each turn a player does NOT discard two of his plot cards. Rather, he can keep through the trading round and even trade them to opponents. He has the opportunity to discard cards BEFORE refilling his hand at the beginning of the next round.

3) When receiving new plot cards at the beginning of each turn, a player receives enough cards to bring his hand back UP TO the larger number listed on the player aid card. Thus, if a player held two cards from the previous round, he would only receive three new cards in rounds 2 – 6 (in a four player game).

4) Each turn, a player is dealt a number of business tiles equal to the smaller number listed on the player aid card, regardless of how many business tiles he kept from the previous round.

*For 6 Players*
The distribution is:
5/3 5/3 4/2 4/2 4/2 2/2
and
5 3 2 2 2 1

This is a completely open negotiation game that's oddly reminiscent of Monopoly--you're desperately trying to trade for properties that are next to one another so that you can complete sets and profit even more from them.  The rules are very simple.  However, I found the open negotiation aspect to be a little troubling, as sometimes it's hard to get people to budge from their asking prices.  Maybe I'm just not a big fan of that mechanic.

After all, thats what negotiation games should be about.

(01/18) I usually hate trading/bidding dynamics. I checked Chinatown on discount and saw it's was a lot negotiating and thought "meh" but then I read about it being part of classic games like Ra, Castles of Burgundy, etc. and did more research, I stumbled on a review that was made by the guys at SU&SD and it highlighted the incredibly free form trading mechanism this game had, and how it elevated it from a simple math game to a good interactive and specially positive interaction game. and decided to buy it (in a combo with Biblios) 

This is one of my favorite games, even if I lose, I often have a good time, the interactions feel genuine, you actually feel like you have shops on a market, rather than just putting stuff around a board. you actually feel for the stuff you build.

You win this game by having the most money, and usually it is a close victory.

Really love that you can negotiate literally anything.

Pretty easy rules, but a lot of fun to play.

A lot of people knock the end game, but they don't understand negotiation. Everyone says it is simple math and whether things benefit them, but a great negotiator knows it's not about deals that just give you more money. If Player A thinks he is 20k ahead of B but 50 ahead of C, he would consider giving C a +30k deal that gives him nothing, just so he doesn't make a deal with b to give him anything positive.

I won x2 by taking those deals late game because the leader didn't want to take any deals that didn't profit him more than the other person. Strong negotiation is only the first part of the equation.

It's everything you wanted in any economic, business, or negotiation game, and it does it in less than an hour. I rate it lower only because it just doesn't work with less than four. Once you cross that threshold, it's golden. There are hardly any actual mechanics, so it's extremely easy to learn. The 'a-ha!' point for players happens as soon as income is generated for the first round.

If someone grabbed "Monopoly" and turned it into a fun game, they'd end up with "Chinatown".

I consider this one a gateway game for people who have only played the mass market games such as the aforementioned one. There's money, there's trading, there's buying/building businesses, it's pretty short (compared to, you know, "Monopoly"), no player elimination (we've seen some crazy unexpected underdog victories).

There's a luck factor involved, so your strategy will most likely change every time you play it, keeping it fresh.

A free-for-all negotiation game with lots of great competition. Easy to teach, just one small paragraph of rules. It's a good companion to Acquire, which is a high compliment. 

I could think of additional rules to make it more tactical (e.g., the ability to overbuild/demolish, different maps, maybe an auction for tiles), but that would destroy the quick and cutthroat part of the game, where people build themselves into a corner. So best to have the game as it is -- more about negotiation than rules. And that aspect makes the game unique from other rule-heavy auction/trading games.

This is a game that could lead to AP. It is a heavy trading game and every trade could give you or someone else a good amount of money sooner or later, but you have to trade to play this game - there's really little to no chance you can do anything without trading because of the way the properties and shop tiles are distributed randomly. I really like the game, but it's definitely better when played with friendly people. If people get cut-throat or if people start trying to calculate profits 5-6 rounds out, it gets tedious.

Great game. People usually need 2 games before they really understand the value of buildings and locations. Beginners tend to be very deal aversive at first.

Although the beauty of Chinatown over ToG is that trade off's are more obvious, deals are still freeform in that money, unplaced businesses and vacant plots can be negotiated and I don't have the maths brain to determine if I'm getting a fair deal or not....that's why only resources trading in Settlers is still the most accessible and the most fun.

Like most social games, depends heavily on the group.  One idiot (or deliberately dickheaded player) can wrench up everyone's plans and make a good time frustrating and seemingly unfair.

As a fan of early Euros, Chinatown has been on my to-play list for a while. I rather enjoyed it as a less chaotic take on real-time negotiation than I'm the Boss. The final round is a bit annoying though - once everything is perfectly calculable there's no game left. Sackson managed this better with the random game-end clock in I'm the Boss.

Without question, this is my new favorite game. PR has a lot of benifits, but it can't brag about simplicity of rules or depth of interaction between players like this one can. I have never had a screaming match in PR, but I had one in my first game with this one. Board gaming at its finest.

Edit: Time has shown this game to be not as good as it one was. But it is still a classic in my book.

Edit: OK, it is not time that has been unkind to this game. Actually, it is that I suck incredibly bad at this game and know too many people that don't suck at it.

A neat cutthroat negotiation game. And when I say negotiation, I pretty much summarised the game already. The whole game hinges on the players' willingness to take part on frantic, fun and feisty negotiations with each other. Imagine Settlers of Catan's trading phase: The game and you almost know all Chinatown is about. The theme and art is neat but more or less pasted on. Like the game, but I can see how some might fail to actually see the game in here (lack of mechanics) but to me, the interaction is where it's at anyway, so I enjoy this kind of game.

The upside:
-The kind of game where you can negotiate everything for anything, and that will only work with the right group.

The downside:
-Kingmaking is an issue, as one will be inclined to provide the better deal to those who do not seem to be winning.
-All the choices seem tiny ones, and even if you make a lot of those, there's a certain lack of importance and relevance in the shape of your game.

Brilliant.  
This is a pure negotiation game that doesn't incentivize you towards duplicity.   
It's as pure a model of the free market as I've ever seen.  Everyone needs to work with everyone else to get what they need, and if you act shady people won't want to deal with you.
Extremely streamlined and easy to teach.

RATING: 7
Thought the broad trading guidelines (you can trade anything) would result in a game that quickly bogged down in protracted negotiation, but as everything is open, trades are fairly fast and straightforward. More "let's benefit both of us" than "I just got screwed in that deal". Luck of the tile and card draw has arguably more significance than your trading abilities, but a smart deal can help poor card deals. Fast playing and particularly easy to learn. I'm generally not a fan of negotiation games, but this is probably the best I've played, mainly because of the open nature of the game.

I've had so much emotional oscillation packed into two plays of this. Pleasure, pain, frustration, elation, and more... and this is all brilliant! I would play this at every opportunity. It doesn't get more than an eight however, as the component quality is lacking. The shop tiles are peeling, and although they aren't handled much, I'm aware that they may need some attention in the future. Also, the finish on the coloured ownership markers is poor, and two of the yellow ones are stuck together fast. I'm thinking of replacing the business district cards with tokens to be drawn from a second bag.

some drawing randomness, and the negotiation part is not that strong. 

but it's depend on the group I think. 

Edit: After second play with my best friend group.
Wow! this game is amazing with the right group, the negotiation is very tense and really the meat of the game.

But still, the experience and feeling around the table is great, it's still need some calculation on ROI, which is fine but the problem is you need to negotiated your way to get those ROI. It's not my favorite mechanic when mixed together.

EXCELLENT STRAIGHT UP NEGOTIATION GAME
Randomly drawn properties and business tiles, cut deals, generate income.  Great game with game geeks or the family.  Probably best played fast and loose.  Overly analytical players could suck the joy out of this one.  I'd rate this one as an underappreciated gem.

Z-Man version - nice production with wooden and thick tile bits and great artwork (although I think I like the Alea art better). Two plays: one 2 player and one 5 player. Simple but elegant game. Great for a mixed crowd of gamers and non. Super easy to teach and lots of interaction. I liked the five player best. I enjoyed the games but I'm not sure about staying power. Could get stale after 10+ plays. We'll see.

RATING: 7
(+) Terse rulset that allows players to drive the game.  
(+) Tense, thick, heavy player interaction. Those with weak constitutions and/or poor bargaining skills need not apply.  
(+) Playtime is relatively low if players are sharp in their planning and decisive in their negotiation.

(-) Underwhelming final round as players trade in formalities lower on the negotion aggression continuum.  
(-) Most aspects of the game are calculable, and can contribute to some mild AP.  
(-) Out of print.

I like boardgames that are packed with player interaction and that is exactly where Chinatown shines. The game itself is simple, elegant and provides the framework needed for the open, unlimited, free-for-all negotiation that makes this game shine.  Everyone is involved in every stage of the game and the game length feels exactly right. Even if I don't win I feel fulfillment from having built up my businesses! Component quality is good. Even though the cards are really small, I prefer them over flimsy paper money.

--Nov2008-- I rather enjoyed my first outing in Chinatown.  The open-ended trading was fun; and the game (with these first opponents, at least) didn't bog down in calculation.  I could see it doing much more poorly with some different opponents, but it's definitely worth the occasional visit.

Heavy pure negotiation. 

I would play this often with the right group, but 
I would never want to play this with the wrong group, which says more about me as a player than it does about the game. Negotiation isn't my favorite mechanic, and this game was made for those who love negotiation and interaction. I prefer either cooperation or being the master of my own fate. 

I had a lot of fun playing this game and can admire it for what it is.

The rules for negotiating are much more open and as a result you can make more satisfying deals. It's such a great one.

very accessible Interactive Euro

I once played this with my wife & a few male non-gamer friends where we had tapas and gin and tonics with the game, and the negotiations were extensive and convoluted, but always diplomatic and uplifted. Both of them afterward said that it was the most amazing boardgame experience that they'd ever had...they didn't know it was possible to enjoy a boardgame that much. I remember that time whenever I play, and always want a gin & tonic as I lay out the pieces. 

I did like the Monopoly negotiations of my childhood, and do miss them from time to time. This recreates them nicely, without all of the tedious rolling and moving.

Negotiation in its pure essence.  In fact, there is almost no other mechanics, unlike [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=32&Itemid=1]Traders of Genoa[/url][/i] and [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=48&Itemid=1]Bohnanza[/url][/i], which is still the best of the genre.  As in all the games of this type, it can be ruined when players decide which deals to make based on apreciations different from the development of the gameplay itself.  Besides, other players' bad deals may influence the results.

RATING: 10
Trading, nothing but glorious trading. This game is all about speculating on what could be useful to you in a few turns. Generally trades are small but a couple times a game a "big deal" involving everyone at the table happens. The key is to gain in small increments while making your trading partners feel they're gaining in bigger increments. I love it. The first round is sort of boring and the last round is overly deterministic, but those middle rounds are great!

A játék nagyon rendben van és ez az új kiadás egyszerűen gyönyörű. A kézbe kapott lapok és a zsákból húzott üzlettípusok szerencsefaktora bőven kompenzálható a fő fázisban amikor az ember próbál olyan előnyös üzletet kötni, hogy a számára fontos helyeket megszerezze illetve a megfelelő üzlettípus lapocskákat is begyűjtse. Nagyon magas az interakció a játékosok között, szinte állandóan szereplője mindenki, nem kell várni a következő játékos lépésére. 1-1,5 óra alatt bőven le tud menni a játék ami tökéletesen megfelelt nekem. A szabálya rém egyszerű ezért olyanoknak is érdemes lehet megmutatni, akik ritkán játszanak. Talán a Bohnanza-hoz hasonlítanám egy kicsit.

This is a great trading game. Note: this kind of game is completely dependent on the players. If they don't get into the game, then it's going to be fairly lame.  But, if you get people who like wheeling and dealing, then this is going to be great for you.

I think this game's reputation benefits strongly from it's unavailability.  The idea of literally everything in the game being tradeable is great, but the game sort of grinds to a halt in the later rounds when no one really wants to trade much.

I finally realised that this game is what Monopoly would have been with the benefit of several more generations of game mechanism evolution.  It's got the trading, investment, risk based on probability and random aspects but loses the disastrous roll-and-move mechanic that overwhelms M.  Will snag a copy of the upcoming reprint.

Game of trading your businesses in Chinatown. Easier to explain than Settlers, with 4 people fits into 1 hour (for 2nd game). I was a bit worried there will a bit too much math in the game but it didn't prove that way.

The game has a very compact set of rules and the majority of the game is in negotiation as you try to outwit your opponents and establish the most profiting businesses in order to earn more money.

RATING: 6.5
Played once with 4P, and another with 5P. Chinatown is a free-form negotation game with a splendidly simple ruleset. Players haggle over 6 rounds for the ownership of lots and the rights to establish businesses. As with any negotiation-heavy game, the usual caveat applies that you need the [i]right group[/i] for this – play with those willing to speak up, are playing to win, yet won't drag out negotiations endlessly.

So assuming you are fortunate enough to have such a group, they also need to be into calculations (but not too much). The negotiations here are a bit too mathematical for my tastes, because while speculation on future lots and tiles means their values are not precisely calculable, players are still able to fine-tune trade values to a degree. The unevenly distributed element of speculation also leads to a few dull rounds – too little information to work with in the first round means very little can be negotiated, while the steadily decreasing randomness renders the last two rounds practically calculable.

What saves Chinatown is the inherent chaos of the free-for-all negotiations. As long as you can think on your feet and get players to agree to reasonable deals quickly, you should be able to catch number crunchers off guard. Because in the end, making the most [i]good[/i] trades trumps making one or two [i]optimum[/i] trades.

Since chaos is a good thing here, it then follows that Chinatown plays best with the maximum number of players. Sure, it will frustrate those who want complete control and order over negotiations, but I wouldn't want to play it any other way. Strengthening the case for playing this with a full table is that it lowers the odds of players drawing into a set of contiguous lots early on.

To recap, Chinatown needs a group with an uncommon combination of qualities – primarily, being willing to perform calculations yet able to tolerate some chaos. The brilliant rounds are bookended by mediocre ones, and the currency denominations in the Z-Man edition look confusingly similar. It's not the ideal negotiation game for me even in the best circumstances, but there are brief moments halfway through the game when it feels like one.

[2 plays] A pure negotiation game, so this surely isn't everyone's cup of tea. As with all negotiation games, there's the risk of bogging down, the risk of hard feelings if certain people won't deal with certain other people, and it can become a contest of personalities. All that said, I liked it fine, and I think it is rather well done. I'll happily play this again, but I may not keep it for myself considering it will take the right group of players to get this on the table again very often.

A lightweight negotiation based game: players are dealt cards that correspond to plots of land. Negotiations are made for buidings, plots, money etc. They then build (from a random pool) buildings that score $$$ at the end of each of the six rounds.

This is the game that Traders of Genoa should be (less obtuse scoring methods, better handling of elements of negotiation). It's quick, fun and easy to get involved in. Much of the game requires players to know what things are worth, what the tile pool is like and how best to score early.

I dislike the 'random' end of turn card bonuses and they can easily give players an extra $5-15k. I say, scrap it!

Magas fokú interakciót igénylő játék. Kínai kereskedőnegyedeket építenek fel a játékosok különböző fajtákat és megpróbálnak egymás melletti ugyanolyanokkal többséget szerezni cserék által. Az egymással való kereskedésről szól az egész játék.

[2011-07-21]
A nagyfokú interaktivitást kedvelőknek kifejezetten ajánlott, de tulajdonképpen ez a jó játékmenet elrontója is. Ha ugyanis elkezdjük számolni, pontosan mikor és mennyiért éri meg egy-egy csere az más szerint rontja a játékélményt, viszont ha nem számolunk, akkor tulajdonképpen kockadobással is eldönthetnénk ki nyerje a játékot. Másrészt pedig a laphúzásokon a cserék ellenére is sok múlik érzésem szerint, ha valaki első körben jól húz, nagyon nehéz megfogni. Illetve igazán csak 4-en, 5-en jön ki a játék igazi ereje. Nálam sosem lesz kedvenc, de aki szereti a kereskedős játékokat azoknak nagyon ajánlott.

Great trading game!  Unlike other negotiation games, in that it is absolutely reliant on making the most deals rather than the best deals.  Game isn't designed so much for the Big Score or the Swindle. The only fault is that it everyone wants to make one last deal, but people wanting to stretch out a game because they are so into it doesn't seem like it should be a strike against it.  High potential for good fun.  Play only with social people that want to make deals.

*two months later*  Some of the shine is coming off.  A powerful factor is simply the luck you have in drawing your tiles and your aggression on the trade floor.  Many people like the later element, but in practice its a bit nasty for a lighthearted group game.

The king of tactical negotiation games, virtually devoid of strategy and totally dependent on wheeling and dealing.

A fun game where everyone (for the most part) is involved at all times. My problem is that (like Santiago) most of the math is right there on the board so it's a lot of calculation and I'm not particularly good at it and I don't really want to do it. It's not like I can't do the math but when you add in the trade potential for another building, plus cash, plus the value over time, plus how it's going to affect the other person's income, I'm somewhat thrown out of the game. However, like I said, it's still fun, it's just that I'll probably never win.

Solid negotiation game, although I still like Traders of Genoa much more.  Still, it's got a pure wheel-and-deal mechanism as you take what you're dealt and try to work it so that you can create something that's going to pay you out.  The game seems like it might drag, but really, the negotiation is generally simultaneous, doesn't draw out all that much, and with only six rounds, this game is not overly long and quite engaging.  In a strange way, this reminds of Monopoly in that you're trying to collect complete sets of a given property.  Of course, the lack of roll-and-move and bankrupting your opponents as an objective really raises this one quite a bit.

UPDATE: The more I think about this one, the more luck-based I think it is.  I still enjoy the negotiation aspect of it, but the card and tile draws can go a long way to cheap deals leading to victory.

UPDATE #2: Really seeing how luck comes into play with this one and just is not among my top choices anymore.

This game is all about trading and negotiation, and as such, it's a ton of fun.

At Origins, I generally stumble into games just by being in the right place at the right time and by being willing to try just about anything. I stumbled across a couple guys who were eager to try Chinatown. I had heard of it before but knew nothing about it, but figured why not?

The rules were simple enough to understand as they were taught to me, and strategy became apparent as the game went on. This game was a challenge for me, though, because in general I feel like I do poorly at games that require negotiation and barter. (Although actually, while I didn't win this game, I didn't do too badly either.)

Play again? Probably not. It was fun to learn the game and meet some new people, but this game just didn't do anything for me.

RATING: 7.5
[Alea 1999 edition] {Merchant; economic, trading, set collection, tile-laying; optimal 5p} An interesting and challenging negotiation/trading game. Among my negotiation games, Chinatown requires the heaviest negotiation skill because you can virtually negotiation any items in Chinatown. If you can't negotiate, you can never win in Chinatown. In Chinatown, any kinds of negotiation, except future promises, are allowed simultaneously. You are not bound to negotiating with an active player, or a negotiation between 2 players. A typical game runs around 1 ~ 1.5 hours, which is shorter than Diplomacy / Traders of Genoa. Since there are plenty of interactions in around an hour, it's enjoyable to play Chinatown.

There is some luck in drawing plots. The variants proposed by West Bank Gamers can be used to increase the control and depth of Chinatown. I prefer playing Chinatown with 2 variants: Bonus card is known before negotiation and new business can ONLY be built if it has access to a street.

It's sad that this game is OOP. I recommend this for those who like trading games.

[Updated] It's a good news that Chinatown will be reprinted in 2007.

Loved this game the first time I played it. Very social group who got into the spirit of the game; however, I had to lower my rating a bit after playing it a second time.

This group was much less in to it and spent more time calculating the actual values of trade offers than going with the flow. Much less enjoyable.

An excellent game when played with the right crowd.

If you like trading, and making deals you'll like this but you'll also need to like maths as there is a lot of working out of pofit margins in this game.

The free trading mechanic is a fun twist, but the more experienced gamers will recognize the value of each trade more clearly, and rip off the less experienced gamers.  The last turn is boring, as everyone is able to calculate exactly how much everyone will make or lose on each trade, spawning much analysis paralysis.

RATING: 7
It was perhaps a bit too simplistic and the negotiations weren't as exciting as I expected.  Perhaps with more players it would be better as I only played with 3.  I believe this game can benefit from expansions.  Money not being smaller is a little weird.  I was hoping to have to pay for properties or buildings to balance an investment risk, as is there's no deterrent or hard decision when building, just a matter of getting the tiles you want.  Tile placement is very fun here and leads to the most fun.  I also wished to see hazards happen to your buildings, like fires, vandalism.  Maybe even caused by other players.

Update 2011-
I like it, I just don't know why it's not a favorite, can't quite put my finger on it.  Perhaps all the randon negotiating players do and the refusal of some to make good deals becaus ethey mistrust you personally.  My family loves it and rates it a 9 though.

The corrected rules and fun players reaffirm the socialability of the game. Easy to teach, and plenty of laughter. New players like it alot. Raised it to a 8.5

**241209
Raised the ratings to a 9 after playing with Chap, Yaohui, Karen and Jon. This game proves that it works even in usually serious players. Easy game play tilts its score slightly above Traders of Genoa, and more interaction push it over Santiago as well.

RATING: 8.9
How negotiation games should work. Just enough structure to point players in the right direction, but enough freedom to do as they please.

For me, the trading and deal making in this works better than Bohnanza and I'm The Boss, though I'm The Boss is definitely funnier (just not more fun). I'm keen to play this again soon to see if it stands up to repeat plays.

Update: I'm beginning to really love this game, though it's not one I can play frequently because I find it exhausting. Of all my games, it's probably the one I want to win most every time it hits the table. Everything is for sale as a price, everything is negotiable.

I had particular fun in my last game; trading away a spot that was valuable to me to another player to give me leverage against a third player who then gave me enough money to attempt to buy back the original space I'd traded away and still leave me with a healthy profit. :D

Rating up from 7.6 to 8.9.

Very Very nice negotiation game.  This one is pretty pure as far as negotiation goes.  Which leads me to compare this one with I'm the Boss.  But this one might achieve the same level without quite being as mean as I'm the Boss can sometimes get.  Which would be a plus with newer players. 

I believe this one has found a home in our collection.

A nice negotiation game. Less "friction" than (Traders of) Genoa. Has money to lubricate trades, so bargaining is smoother than Bohnanza. But, suffers the problems of all trading games, interminable negotiation with players who don't know the balance of the game or are indecisive, screw the perceived leader, a bad or uncaring trader can destroy the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I love this game. Just the right length with lots of negotiation. The only flaw is that it is "solveable" once half the board is filled up. You can calculate exactly how much a property is worth and then either split the prospective profit with whomever sells the business/title to you, or just refuse to make a deal that doesn't get you more than 50% of the profit. It'd be much better if the second half of the game had the same sense of uncertainty that you feel at the beginning of the game, which would then prevent players from simply phoning in the second half of the game.

This game is everything Monopoly wanted to be. There is no dice and it only lasts 6 rounds.

For serious gaming no way. For a gaming evening with casual gamers or family yes way. Social negotiation game. This is on the nice side, it's just business, no invading your country or other serious back stabbing involved. Luck of cards and tiles may put you in a good position without the need to negotiate, so don't take this game too seriously. It's just for fun.

Update: I prefer Genoa over Chinatown any day of the week. Last rounds of Chinatown are just too boring, because you can already calculate just about everything and Chinatown is too luck dependent for my taste. Genoa is exciting to the very end and you get the same social negotiation aspect.

I love this game!  It's basically Monopoly on steriods and without the massive lag-time, crappy rolling dice or BIG Loser feel.  Even with 6 people it can play in an hour and leaves a big game feeling in its wake.  There's tons of interaction and it's extremely easy to teach.

I think it's quite nearly a perfect game.  Buy it.

The game is pretty straightforward after you play a few times and know how to value things.  In the back of my mind, I know that the game could be a lot better with some different types of tiles, but I can't deny that I really love this game!

I had an idea for some special tiles that would mix things up, but I can't imagine they'll ever see the light of day.  After playing for a while, the deals are getting kind of predictable.

After a few plays, I felt like the game was getting a bit stale.  Since physical game size is a consideration in my game collection, I decided to trade it off.

RATING: 6
Here's my problem with negotiation games of this type - its technically "solvable". Here's what I mean. If you need my one space on the board to finish your business, I can see that you will make an addition [for example] 5000 each turn for the next 4 turns over what you would make without finishing. Meaning that at a minimum (there is possibility for bonuses, but I'll ignore that) giving you the space is worth 20k. Fine pay me 10k and we're good. And that's what I mean by solvable. A good player is not going to just give up money/points to another player unless the deal is equitable. Since the equality is based in math, the deals (should) be zero sum. Which means - the winner is determined randomly based on the cards that come out and the tiles you get. There is no "secret way" to change the endgame outcome - you just get lucky or play with people with no math skills...

RATING: 6
Everyone labels Chinatown a "pure" negotiation game. Negotiation is certainly front and center, but I have trouble understanding how anything can be a single "pure" mechanic. Chinatown is no different. Planning when and where to launch your new businesses is in important exercise in timing. Likewise, and probably most importantly, you have to be able to quickly and accurately calculate your expected profit for each move.

Each round you receive a random hand of cards that correspond to number squares on the board. You also receive a random hand of shop tiles, which you'll use to build up your business empire. The randomness is annoying, but probably comparable to a game like Acquire, where you might get frustrated, but you typically have options. In any case, frustration is key to making the game work because it forces you to make trades with other players. This means you'll want deeds and shop tiles that are either really helpful to you, or really helpful to someone else. Middling tiles are nearly useless.

After you receive your deeds and tiles, the game opens up for a free-for-all negotiation phase. If that sound daunting, don't worry. Despite the open-ended feel, there are typically only a few things you're looking to get done. And because information about everyone else's holdings (except money) is open, it's quick and easy to assess who you need to talk to, and what they might be interested in. I'd say the level of negotiation is only slight more involved than [thing=11][/thing], for example. The real trick is trying to understand how much you should pay (or demand) for each deal because there is a lot to consider.

And therein lies both the strength and the weakness of Chinatown. You'll likely have a strong desire to come up with some sort of evaluation for every tile placement, every deed, and of course every negotiation. The number (and complexity) of calculations you should probably be performing is astronomical, but the game is much more fun when everyone is just sort of eyeballing it all. Experience will help. Most importantly, everyone needs to work together to make sure no single player gets out to an early lead. These things are easy enough to keep an eye on. The more elaborate trades, especially late in the game, are where things get tricky.

Overall, Chinatown is a solid game that I'd gladly play again. The only thing giving me pause is that evaluation problem. I know I could be playing a more mathematically sound strategy, but I know shouldn't do that because it will bog the game down and kill the fun. In other words, it's a game that fights against its own nature -- but I probably just need to get over myself and have fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I love this genre of games, but for me, Chinatown doesn't stand up to Traders of Genoa.  Chinatown does play faster, so that is a plus.  It feels like the information is too open in Chinatown.  Everybody knows what everyone else has, and everyone knows exactly how much others stand to earn from a given deal.  But still, it has tons of interaction, and if you enjoy trading/negotiating games, this is a winner.

RATING: 7
This is a very fun game, full of frenetic free-for-all dealmaking. Prone to wild swings of luck (even when you play with the much needed bonus card variants) so don't take winning too seriously, just enjoy the experience.

UPDATE 5/19/13: My opinion is about the same, but a couple of flukey games increased my feeling that this game approaches an un-fun amount of luck. Be warned.

I purchased the German version by Filosofia since the Z-Man edition is through-the-roof expensive as it's out of print right now. I'm glad I have it. I played my first game the other night and I can see the great potential it has for interesting interactions and strategic planning. It's fun to hold something somebody else wants and talk about what I can get for it in return.

The rules are simple enough that nearly all ages can play, yet the gameplay is compelling and interesting enough to entertain all ages as well. It is well deserved of its high family ranking.

Recommended. Rated an 8 after my first play.

RATING: 6
The game was exactly what it was billed as, a pure trading game.  In fact it is almost a complete sandbox.  You get some properties and some industries and then you are open to trade anything you want, any kind of deals you want to make.  

There are virtually no rules that I can see for trading, and the book literally says you may trade anything.  So promises, lies, residual payments, etc are all on the table.

Then you build out the stuff you acquired and make money, rinse and repeat.

The game requires all the players to want to be involved in and trade, this is not a game where you can sort of refuse to be involved in the trading aspect, as you will have no fun and you will lose.

The game also lends itself to some kingmaking because a smooth talker can just get awesome deals for themselves, but I think that is the point of the design.

If you like games with trading, wheeling, and dealing, then this is a game you should really try. Each round players draw plots of land. Then players draw shop tiles, but leave them in front of themselves. At this point it is time to make trades. Everything is up for grabs trade wise. Only shop tiles already built cannot be moved, otherwise claimed plots of land can be swapped at will. Owned shops are up for negotiations too. My group loves this game. I bought it in the sale bin last October, and within a week 4 more people in the group bought it. That is a mark of a good game.

It requires a certain group of people to make it work, since if there's just one person that doesn't like to negotiate and/or is unwilling to calculate the potential value of trades, the game can fall apart. The open information as well as the set number of rounds can make the last round or two a bit anti-climactic. That being said, it's still a great trading game and a personal favorite.

RATING: 6.5
This could be fun but I think there are some alarming issues. If someone wants to buy something from you, you can calculate what they will gain from having it and ask for some percentage of it (any percentage you can think of). Often there is no one else to sell the same thing (especially if it's land rather than a placeable business) so there's no competition to keep prices reasonable. Sort of the opposite problem of Bohnanza, in that there are too many possible deals. I don't think it's that interesting to see how much you can extort from someone.

Interesting to think of how to handle the early game situation where the buyer doesn't have on-hand a reasonable percentage of the worth of what he wants to buy. Maybe a deal could last into future turns (but be non-binding).

Getting screwed by the tile draw seems like a real issue. If everyone has the same deal-making ability I guess the rest is just luck, because I don't see much non-obvious strategy...

The last turn of the game seems to completely suck as there are only useless plots of land still in the deck for the most part. People just empty their hand to get a few more bucks out of their useless holdings.

Trackable money, theoretically secret, is a potential issue too. If people play mainly for first place and have an idea about who's in the lead, the game could break and have kingmaker situations.

It's turned into a favorite of our group (for some of us, anyway - I've heard it said that you either love it or you hate it, there's no inbetween) and is one of the best bartering and negotiation games I play.  I especially like the components of the Alea Edition! Strange, it's about Chinatown NY USA, the game components (American $$, tokens, street names on the board) are all English, yet the rules were published in German only, and Alea never released an English edition of the rules!

Unknown why it doesn't use the six card multipliers to count rounds.  Also, the rules don't suggest the standard variant from the 1st edition.  I simply like the original edition better, but these bits are very nice, as is the board. (I finally played a game with this edition, and the big board and tiles are really nice to play, but I do miss the 6 turn card randomizer and was unaware the rules don't require a business to have road access in this edition. That's very WRONG!!)

This is a negotiation game in the truest sense of the word. In it, players acquire ownership of sections of city blocks then place tiles, representing businesses, onto the block-sections. At the end of each turn, each tile you've laid gives you some sort of payout, but completed businesses (formed of three to six connected tiles of the same type) pay quite a bit better. All these resources are dealt to the players randomly, however, so players must trade to get matching businesses and adjacent locations.

A pretty sweet trading game with straightforward mechanics along the lines of "I want what you have, you want what I have, let's make an equitable trade." Except of course, you are constantly trying to swing the trade in your favor. Players try to negotiate a purchase or trade for shop lots and businesses in an effort to establish a chain or cluster of shop lots operating a single type of business. Success means expanding your business and bringing in more revenue each round. A really simple yet intense trading game. Not for folks who don't like negotiation games.

There's nothing wrong with this game, but I find this experience extremely exhausting. The way I went about this game was treating it as a giant math trade. If anyone wanted any of the tiles that I had, I got them to trade for the tiles I wanted from other people. Never deal with people directly for the stuff you want. I won the game by a significant margin as well; make sure you hold onto your cash!

Trading game set in New York's Chinatown. Incorporates open trading for numbered lots, business tiles, built businesses and money - good play involves creativity in the trading phase, which is the meat of the game. When played with the standard rules, seems to involve a run-away leader problem if certain players are able to build decent businesses in the early turns while others cannot - this is mainly an issue as that capacity is essentially dictated by the early lot and tile draw. There is also an issue where the open information may be prohibitive to trading as players can see the benefits of certain trades to others. I may like to try this with the "West Bank" variant introduced in these forums, which may correct some of these issues by adding some hidden information. Despite the issues, Chinatown shows promise as the game is very interactive, simple and has an original theme - new players generally "get it" after one round. As for the components (Filosofia/Z-man) - (1) unlike the droves on BGG that seem to overwhelmingly shun paper money, I would have preferred that here instead of the small hard to differentiate green money cards; (2) the board is beautiful but my copy is prone to warping; (3) the reference cards are a little small; (4) otherwise, the art, the wood disks and business tiles are excellent quality and the game includes the necessary draw bag for the tiles.

I love negotiation games. My love for the genre is one part nostalgia (too much monopoly as a kid-- where fearsome, wild trading is the only enjoyable memory from those many wasted hours) mixed with the overly romantic ideal of mastering the artful deal. And so it makes sense that I'd like Chinatown. But, like so many loves rooted in the romantic, a more sober look reveals that the object of desire is greatly flawed. And like so many loves rooted in the romantic, that hardly matters!

Chinatown is great! Chinatown is terrible! Both of these statements are true I am happy/sorry to report.

Chinatown is great! As a romp through the rush of good deal making Chinatown is great. The rules are so very extremely simple (the game works for gamers and non-gamers!), the game length just right and the complexity of the possible deals rich enough to  allow for real creativity. ("Hey! I'll trade money and tiles for property spaces and an established business over there") As two hours spent trying to get an edge with a few inspired deals this is a blast.

Chinatown is terrible! Truly crafty, artful deal making relies on asymmetric information and asymmetric value. Sadly, Chinatown lacks asymetric information which reduces any positive deal outcome to either: (a) coming out ahead via luck or (b) duping an opponent by being better at the (simple) maths.

In Chinatown, the precise value of most deals-- and all late game deals-- is calculable and known to all players. If everyone can do the math we'd expect that optimum play would produce zero sum trades. If optimum play produces zero sum trades then the winner will be determined by the luck of the draw-- who pulls that last factory they need out of the tile bag or the 5th property space card right next to their adjacent four.

The only way for a negotiation game to avoid this trap is to include asymmetric information: I know something about the future value that you do not which leads to asymmetric value: the value to me is different than it is to you because of how I can use what I get in combination with things I already have and know. A good example of a game that has these elements, and thus an example of a superior trading game is Traders of Genoa.

It is interesting to note that the geek fix to this "Chinatown Problem" is to introduce asymmetric information by making property locations closed until the end of the round. (In the rules as written this is open information.) Many claim this introduction of asymmetric information completely "fixes" the game. (See the "Westbank Gamers Variant" thread for more.)

OK. So there is the fatal flaw of Chinatown: that the value of all deals are known to all in advance. This essential problem is spelled out in many of the critical game comments here on BGG. But yet, like real life trading, just because something has the elements required of a zero-sum trade, doesn't mean that it will be one automatically. Why? Because even if the particular concrete elements of the trade are calculable, not all players will calculate well or even calculate at all-- and this is what saves Chinatown: the asymmetrical information isn't in the conjunction of the players' hands and board state, rather it is in knowing which player is the sucker and how to get what you want from him/her.

In the words of some great anonymous poker player (or Chinatown player?), "If you don't know who the sucker at the table is, it is probably you." What emerges in (I imagine) most games of Chinatown is that someone at the table is more willing to give favorable deals-- which is a nice way of saying there is likely to be a sucker at the table. And what is known to different degrees by the other players is who that player is, and what type of negotiation (hard ball? soft sell? bestest-friends-foreverish?) is needed in order to be their primary trading partner. Chinatown is saved from its own fatal flaw: the asymmetric information is: "who is the sucker?"; the asymmetric value is: "how do I present a trade offer from my portfolio that maximizes my trading with the sucker?"

So, if every player at your table is a hard-core number chomping robot, this game will come down to luck of the draw. But if even one single player is making deals by gut, the flaw is fixed and gaming the player's at the table is pure negotiating bliss. Bring me a table with at least one sucker, and I'll show you two hours of electrifying gaming delight.

This is a game of pure negotiation and trading and nothing else.  It's as pure of a game of trading as you can get.  The few mechanisms that exist are simply there to provide a platform to trade.  As with most games where people are yelling over eachother to make deals, it can lead to some animosity if your group isn't laid back enough.  It's a fun, easy to teach, and quick game... but I favor other games with additional mechanisms more.  Namely Lords of Vegas and Bootleggers.

I don't usually go in for these types of games as they can drag out unnecessarily.  This one is setup very nicely although I often curse the event cards, they never go my way.  There are still times when I think this game requires a timer but for the most part trades are easy to value and things usually move along quickly.  I particularly like the tendancy for chain trades as these can be very lucrative and very entertaining.

One play left me pretty lukewarm.  I like the trading, as I almost always do when it's present in a game, but the economic system that it was paired with left me somewhat cold.  We crunched out the value of stuff to make it a very staid, dry affair.  I think this game would have been better played more off-the-cuff, not calculating out what things are likely to be worth down to the strict amounts.  Trading would have been freer that way, and there would have been less downtime as people stared at the board doing math.  But, as the endgame gets closer, it's awful tempting to start doing math.  This game is probably going to be a one-and-done game -- not good enough for me to seek out again.

I was lucky enough to pick up the new Z-Man version of this game recently.  Let me note right away, the cover art made me cringe a little with the stereotyped Chinese Man but the rest of the art and components are all top notch. My one quibble aside, this is a fantastic game.  I LOVE the "anything goes" trade round.  With five players, stores and building spaces are being swapped all over.  It plays relatively quickly.  Not too much chance for AP here, the biggest area is deciding which buildings to keep.  I highly enjoyed my plays of this game and it is one I can see being a regular in my gaming rotation.

Tons of fun but not for the quiet or timid. Chinatown demands haggling, kibbitzing, deal making, and persuasive argumentation.  Almost free form in its necessity to swap businesses, prime locations and filthy luchre.  It moves right along and end games always end up very close.  this is one my group keeps coming back to and it is because of the constant and high spirited player interaction this game inspires. Chinatown takes the best aspects of collecting revenue "sets" and breathes life and personality into swapping property and building your kingdom of fireworks factories and laundrymats...
Do yourself a favor, burn your monopoly board and take a trip to chinatown.

Chinatown is in my opinion a poor design. There is a two-tier set collection aspect which is pretty straightforward and boring, the twist being that players get dealt a bunch of tiles randomly and then have to trade with each other to hopefully complete more and better sets than the others. The major problem here is that despite all the randomness there isn't enough ambiguity. Deals are dry as the values of what is being traded are pretty straightforward. The calculable nature of the game makes the randomness seem that much more offensive.

This may be the best game I've played as far as forced trading goes (I'm not sure where I'm classifying Bohnanza) -- I'm just not sure that I'm a big fan of that. Catan, for example, allows trading with others but also allows trading with the "bank".

I played it with 3, it seems like it would be better with more people. Maybe I would enjoy it more with hidden information or other rule variants?

New York in the 1960’s. A new wave of Chinese immigrants is moving into Chinatown. The adoption of the new immigration act has launched the district in a demographic boom! It now reaches Canal Street to the north and Bowery Street to the east. The immigrants, hard-working men and women, are arriving by the thousands to buy buildings, establish businesses and fulfill the American Dream! In this game, you are one of them. With all your savings in hand, the Big Apple is up for grabs! Will you know how to use your talents and acquire the most extraordinary fortune in America?
\13\\13\
The board represents the New York Chinatown of the mid-60’s. It is divided into 6 districts containing buildings numbered from 1 to 85. A game is played over 6 rounds. In each round, the players receive income from the businesses they have managed to establish. To generate the maximum income, shops of the same type need to be built on adjacent buildings. At the beginning of each round, players draw new Building cards and new Shop tiles. They must then use their negotiation skills to acquire adjacent buildings and establish businesses. But it is not always that easy...

In this game where everything can be negotiated, only the hard laws of the market prevail.

This is probably the most free form game in my collection. Each player gets a random set of business tiles, a random set of property spaces and then is let loose to make as many deals as possible to try and turn those locations into money. Anything goes, the player that has the most money at the end of five rounds wins.

It's seems much too straight-forward to be any fun, yet I've enjoyed every session. My only concern is that once everyone is comfortable with the game, the trading will become predictable. I have the Z-man version, so there are no random payout cards to mix things up. I wish I knew if these helped the game, because if they make it better or prevent the game from getting stale, then it would certainly be worth it to proxy some up myself.

Played it at Great Hall Games with Alex, Vincent, and Harry. It is a negotiation game. I don't feel that comfortable with negotiation games, since a lot depends on the personalities of the players. However, the challenge of being out of my comfort zone is reason enough to play again. :)

I won my first game largely by going only for the small businesses.

In this game, players get money, locations, and businesses. They must trade with each other, striving to make the most money by the end. Sets of businesses (located next to each other) make the big bucks.

Excellent trading game.  Translations are a little rough in terms of understanding scoring/pricing.  Otherwise, this is good family subject matter.  It produces very tight scores, even considering that scores are not monitored until the end.  It is also playable by children, if older players take care to counsel the child regarding advantages/disadvantages to the child's position in trade offers.  Some room for modifications, including larger-than-normal buildings (otherwise, "orphan" spaces tend to occur and players run out of motivation when buildings get to maximum size).

Meatier than Bohnanza, but runs faster in our groups. Rules are easy to learn even for casual players, getting a grip on what everything is actually worth might take a few plays. Quite pretty and component quality is excellent (Filosofia/Z-Man). Parts of the game feel a bit abstract (you get random lots and businesses for free from somewhere) but other than that the game has a nice feeling of trying to make deals and building your businesses in Chinatown. I like the runtime of this game with the caveat that this might be better with a lower player count. 5 - player game can go a bit long and it feels like making deals becomes harder since you have less things to offer.

Provisional rating (8). Bit of a grail game for me, shame this edition doesn't have the "bonus" business scoring cards. Looking forward to trying with the Westbank variant.

Updated: Superb game, and non-gamer friendly. Like Cosmic Encounter, the mechanics are simple and the right crowd will make this game a blast - even if you lose twice in a row (as I did). I can understand why this might not work with all groups, but an animated bunch plating nasty - or nice - will have fun.

Updated: Still enjoying Chinatown, just wish it told a story. That's not Chinatown's fault - it does what it does brilliantly.

Set in 1930's New York City, we are Chinese immigrant business people trying to gain a foothold in Chinatown. After initial setup of our venture starting plots it is pure negotiation to trade and expand our businesses in the seafood market, sewing shops, laundry, restaurants, and antiques. The negotiating reminds me of Pit. "I got oats for corn, need corn". You know, and can see you are obviously helping the other trade partners but you hope you are gaining the advantage. Trying to be subtle and indirect may work at first but eventually everyone knows what you need and how valuable it is. It always ends up where somebody gives away the game.

This game heavily relies on trading to be interesting but it's set up in such a way that trades are rarely made becuse they are not equitable for both parties. 

If someone gets lucky early it's natural to avoid trading with them to keep them in check and the game ends up being a bit of a luckfest as people happen to draw tiles or locations that complete businesses for them.

It could be the genre just isn't for me. I'm not a traders of Genoa fan either. (Though this game is much more problematic than that game)

A bit too much open information, making the last turn a bit calculatable. Using the Westbank Gamers variants push it up to a 7 or 7.5. Even with the game as-is, it's a pretty good family trading game. Needs the extra hidden info of a variant if played with math-head game geeks though, or the trading can stall out as everyone does the math.

Z-Man Edition comment: Huge box. Very nice components. No business outlook cards. Plays the same. Use some playing cards for the business outlook cards.

after first play this is my initial rating. I don't own many negotiation/trading games..perhaps the most popular is bohnanza. I also own Die Handler, and, although I believe to be a good game, doesn't stir up the fun factor and enthusiasm from other players while playing. Chinatown on the other hand had two things going for it. 
1. The rounds, and game played quick, probably not far from an hour. We stuck rigourously to the 5 min deal-making time limit. 
2. Everyone got 'into character' with this game. All adopting rather bad chinese accents in pray. This resulted in lotsa laughs, and additionally, fun.

Obviously number 2 relies on the group a fair bit, but I think this is an excellant game and was worth shelling out the big money to get my hands on it, as it was recommended to me at the same time as die handler and instead I went for Die Handler, but I think this is the better game.

UPDATE:
Prefer to play with the variant that we draw x number of cards and discard 2 each round. Rating has improved considerably.

A single kingmaking trade (intentional or not) can render the earlier part of the game completely moot, which is a pernicious hallmark of free-negotiation games.  That's why I can't possibly enjoy them.  And here, ALL present and future earnings are open for inspection, which makes kingmaking - and negotiation in general - that much more heinous.

Also, one player can get especially lucky by drawing building spots that happen to be adjacent.  How fun it is when someone wins the game due to a jackpot card draw.

My favorite negotiation game so far.
It's so simple and easy to teach and people start negotiating like crazy really fast!

You need a good group though! Excellent game!

Very pure trading/negotiation game.  It has a feel of Acquire, Modern Art and Bohnanza.  It is fairly quick to teach/learn and is not very complicated.  Trading can potentially bog down if players are stubborn.

I'm not sure if this is really my cup of tea. Rating based on one play. I suspect it would go up if I played more.. once you start to know the value of the different shops in relation to the difficulty of acquiring the space needed to place them. I'm not so good at free-form bartering, I guess.

Imagine a simpler (lol) version of Ra with auctioning replaced by free-for-all trading of tiles, except the lucksackery is squared because players randomly draw not only the set-collection business tiles but also the locations in which they're placed. (Contiguous placement required, the numbering system on the board recalls Acquire here.) Players can suffer shortages if tiles from the set they're collecting aren't pulled, arbitrarily causing loss of income provided that they were fortunate enough to have already accumulated the needed build space, but the bag contains more copies than just the complete set so players are more frequently screwed by needing area to build their already assembled sets of businesses. Lucking into numbers that border is crucial, and the process takes multiple rounds. If the numbers you need are never drawn, kept, or opponents hold out because you have nothing (and cannot obtain something) to offer them, expect to lose income for each round you're tardy. Players can haggle on price but the information is perfect - you know exactly how much the benefit is worth and for how many rounds - so I would imagine a few plays might even codify the numbers.

Or think of it another way: trading is mutually beneficial to the parties involved, meaning their position improves relative to everyone not involved. Thus, the person that trades most often has the greatest chance of winning. To be able to trade most often, you must have the most to offer. Having the most to offer requires drawing all the best business tiles and building cards. See the dilemma?

Negotiation with a capitol "N". Needs at least 4 and preferably 5 players. Possible risk of imbalance and accidental king making if players of vastly different experience play together.

The trading element tips this game to those with a silvered tongue.  There is luck in what you are dealt, but it is possible to turn crap into gold, or a sweatshop in this game.

Another gorgeous Alea big box game.  The artwork is perfect and overall quality of components is what you'd expect from Alea.  The game itself is good, but seems pretty stripped down.  If you want pure negotiation, this one is excellent.  But there are other games out there that have a real game going on in addition to the ability to argue with your friends.

A trading / negotiation game in the truest sense.  There is a little luck in drawing land plots or shop tiles that you either need or are trade-able for what you need.  Negotiation games take a knack for coming up with a deal that is mutually beneficial.  Some people have a good feel for this, and others don't.  Playing this type of game with the right group of people is paramount.

This one has a good deal of angst in making the deals. Do you make the deal or wait a turn and see if you draw the plot or tile you need? There is a good balance there that makes this an exciting and fun game.

It turns out I really like trading games!  The first time I explained the rules (draw cards for lots, draw tiles for businesses, trade anything, make money from businesses, rinse and repeat...) we felt a bit leary of something so simple. I'm still suprised how much we laughed during that game! We got heavily into the number crunching near the end (but the early uncertainty was probably more fun).  I'm not sure how I would have felt about what I got in the box if I had to pay the full MSRP... but what you get is a very attractive game.

A word of warning to others.  If you have the tendency to think people are out to get you or to take things very personal, do not play negotiation games like this.  With that said, I realize the haggling aspect is central to Chinatown (which I suppose is a fairly accurate reflection of my culture's way of buying and selling goods), but I can't say I enjoy it very much.  Prime real estate locations and shop tiles you can bargain with are valuable to have, but it is equally important to not to push your luck too much and learn to compromise because no resources are 100% definite, unless it happens to be the very last one available.  Bottomline is Chinatown has far too many random elements for me to truly call the experience fun.

A fun negotiation game provided players are willing to actually make deals and keep things moving along. I suspect that the enjoyment factor could be quite group dependent.

[thing=11]Bohnanza[/thing] and [thing=1406]Monopoly[/thing] gave birth, illegitimately, to Chinatown, who was nannied by [thing=3528]Priceless[/thing].  This is a very fun fusion of those three games with nice limitations, such as the fact that you play merely six rounds.  I always enjoy this game.

Rating after one play. Very good negotiation game. I just love these game where you need to rave like a madman to accomplish thing. Game suffers a little bit from a fact that every information is in the open, especially late of the game everybody counts every trade they make and this drags the game a bit and draws some fun from the actual bargaining. But still, this gave me the experience I expected from Genoa and I think Chinatown succeeded in the attempt little bit better than the big G.

After 1 Play: I don't have much experience with negotiation games, but I enjoyed my first play of this.  It took a few turns to get going, but after that some interesting deals were made.  I'm hoping to try Traders of Genoa soon, so after that I'll have something to compare this to.

After 2+ Plays: I liked this game significantly less after playing it again.  The real problem is the transparency of what each item is worth to each player, which make the negotiations a lot less interesting.  Moved rating from 7 to 5.

Awesome game!  The rules and gameplay are so simple... the gets out of the way and allows you to truly "play" with your opponents.  This is pure negotiation where anything goes and everyone has a vested interest in every deal that goes down.  Great fun with the right group.

Of the trading games I've played, this is one of my favorites because it allows you to be creative with your trades, encourages interactivity, yet doesn't bog down or devolve into pointless discussions (I'm looking at you, Traders of Genoa).

Easy recommendation for those that need a high social factor that isn't just take-that action cards or something.

1/1/12 -- Chinatown and I didn't ultimately work out, so I filed the official divorce papers.  I always wondered why RGG never printed the Alea version of this, and maybe now I know why.

11/30/08 -- I don't feel my first two games have adequately shown this game's depth.  It seems like there is more room for insidious and layered deal-making that we haven't quite gotten to yet, which means I'm looking forward to further exploring the game.  I like that it's quick and simple (although Quo Vadis? still has it beat).  Playing the trading phase with a time-limit of 5-7 minutes seems like a good idea (since late-game trading phases started taking a long time while people tried to eke out every last dollar from their trades) and is something I'll attempt to try out next time we play.

le sous-titre, l'art de négocier, n'est pas inscrit pour rien, puisqu'il s'agit de l'intérêt presque unique du jeu; un peu de hasard vient bousculer les plans; ce jeu peut être dur sur l'orgueil, attention donc aux joueurs bouillants...

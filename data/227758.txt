GAME: Kokoro: Avenue of the Kodama
RANK: 2350
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Kokoro: Avenue of the Kodama uses the same art as Kodama which is a pretty and fun little game. However, that’s where the similarities end. In Kokoro you are trying to connect spaces on the board by drawing lines with dry markers. Every round a card is flipped over to tell the shape of the line you are allowed to draw this time.

The box is absolutely beautiful, but the playerboards and the cards do not quite have the same appeal. As a puzzle Kokoro is great fun. However, personally I missed greater strategic depth from the game since the there seemed to be only one winning strategy, i.e., try to draw one long line connecting all sanctuarys and guardians. Perhaps the game could have benefitted from some incentivens to have a maximum number of routes instead of just one.

I recommend this for groups and families that do not care so much about longer term thinking.

RATING: 7
Fun, quick, and enjoyable.  A game about drawing pieces of roads and hoping they connect in the future.  Definitely has some "press your luck" element as you decide if you want to try and chain every single sanctuary together or if you cut your losses and go piecemeal.

Not something I would need to own, but would play again.

Harder than expected to teach to very drunk people new to path drawing games.  Lol.  Lesson learned.  So many T junctions ended up on cards and that is of course impossible in this game.

I used to really enjoy Avenue, the predecessor to this game, so I decided to upgrade to Kokoro. Love the retheme, and hope there will be many more games set in the Kodama universe. I also like the added variability in Kokoro with the decree cards and the randomised Guardian placements. Unfortunately my wife isn't really into spatial games, but not to worry; this is one I can enjoy solo or as an appetiser or dessert on game nights.

Kokoro: Avenue of the Kodama has lovely art and interesting game play. I really enjoy this game and can see it getting a lot of game play. It's got a good amount of challenge and planning in a relatively light game.

A quick game where you draw lines to try and connect worms and flowers to a different scoring area in each of the 5 rounds. However, if you score less points compared to the previous round you'll lose 5 points for that round so there is some strategy of scoring low and trying to slowly build your score. It might even make sense to purposefully take 0 or 1 points in the first round and work on connecting the corners of your board for end game scoring conditions. Overall I enjoyed my play of the game, but didn't think it was anything special and there are more enjoyable 30 minute games that I would rather play. Lastly, one comment on component quality, the dry erase boards are a nice touch, but the erasers on the markers smeared more than they actually erased so keep some tissues handy for cleanup at the end.

[b]Rating based on - 20+ plays, -1 player -2 player[/b]
Kokoro is a 1-8 player path building filler game (similar to Karuba) in the 'Take it Easy' style of games where one condition is produced by the game, and the players individually decide how best to implement that condition into their own personal game. It's also commonly lumped in with the 'Roll 'n Write' games, but in this case there is no roll of a die but the draw of a card to produce the aforementioned condition. Every round a sanctuary card is revealed that will be scored and path cards are revealed showing a path direction which you must find a spot for and draw on your player board. After 4 golden path cards have made their appearance the sanctuary is scored and the next round begins. Your aim is to connect as many flowers and caterpillars as you can to the sanctuary that's being scored, however, if your next score is lower than the previous one you score 0. You also score bonus points at game end for flowers or caterpillars connected to the relevant guardians. Add up your score at the end and minus 5 points for every 0. The person with the most points wins!

Kokoro is based on Avenue by the same designer, and the basic game (described above) plays exactly the same as Avenue. However, Kokoro also includes decree cards which change the game slightly from play to play. eg. 'During the game players may use 3 paths as 4 paths and vice versa', or dictate an end game condition that elevates the puzzle to the next level eg. 'At the end of the game players score 6 points if their guardians are connected to each other by paths'. The decree cards definitely make the game more fun and interesting, but you can also play the basic 'Avenue' game without them.

Having owned and played Avenue a few times I didn't find it very inspired or the deck very fair. Despite shuffling well we'd often draw 4 gold path cards in a row which led to a whole heap of nuthin'! I don't know if the card distribution was changed for Kokoro, but we definitely get a lot more done (even from game 1), and we go through practically the entire deck now, whereas in Avenue we'd often have more than half the deck remaining. I like playing this game a lot! It's the kind of game where you think, "Oh, I've just done a terrible job! Just one more go and I can fix it." That drive to make a better puzzle and/or improve your score, the quick playing time, plus the variability of the decree cards and the tension of hoping the right path comes out before the fourth golden card is drawn will keep me coming back to this one for a long time. It plays great with 2 players, is a fun solo puzzle, and due to the multiplayer solitaire nature of it, should play equally well across all player counts. Artwork + Production Quality = AWESOME!

Feels quite similar to karuba in that you all use the same drawn card/tile on an individual board trying to connect things in various ways to score.
Honestly I prefer karuba of the two for the simplicity of having tiles rather than the drywipe marker which invariably gets smudged all over everything - plus the markers in my copy do not work particularly well

Maybe I would like this more if players had different maps.. or different objectives (there are 'new rules' included which I have not yet played with) but secret goals might have been fun.
Its a bit frustrating that the rounds end randomly and you can get caught out and quite penalised points-wise if the round is unexpectedly short.

Feels like a roll-and-write game without dice.  There is good satisfaction to making the paths connect.  I even enjoyed score-chasing, when I tried it solo a couple of times.  I have not played with the variable objective cards, but I can see how those cards will add some fun and extend replayability.

 - Very pleasant non-confrontational activity for a large player count.
 - Has a nice, low(ish)-risk push-your-like feel.
 - My wife and I like chilling out on the couch playing this together.
 - Noobs will get royally schooled by experienced players for their first game or two,  but should soon be on the same level as everyone else.
 - The special rule cards are good, and a necessity to give the game a little variation, but they unfortunately don't change the game that much.
 - Feels pretty good when you manage to pull off your strat, however it can feel really annoying depending on how the cards are drawn.
 - I recommend this game (or something similar) for everyone's collection as it's a crowd pleaser, albeit a rather mild one.

2017-11-14 - This is a fun little path building game. Think Karuba, but instead of draw a tile and place, it's draw a card and write. It has a nice push-your-luck element, too.

Overall Kokoro is a keeper. I enjoyed the cerebral challenge of planning an optimal route while counting the path cards as they are revealed. My children found the game challenging but not overly frustrating — especially when I let them modify their path slightly! Adding the decree cards provides extra variety and challenge.

Playing the same moves onto separate grids is interesting in games like Scorewords where players take turns to choose moves and others copy them, but feels too frustrating when they're spat out at random here, and when each round ends randomly. Nicely designed player boards and novel score ramping, though.

Neat little game that is more than the sum of its parts. Definitely feels like an improvement on Doodle City, and the game-changer cards are a nice touch. It isn't advertised as such, but I think fans of push-your-luck games will really enjoy Kokoro. It's light and breezy...almost to the point of being relaxing...but there are a lot of things to consider when drawing on your player board. There are a few corner cases that aren't covered in the rules, and I'm not sure how often this will come off the shelf, but I'm really enamored with it right now.

Very fun filler where you are trying to form paths in a grid connecting scoring squares to other squares with point icons, but the sequence of when each scoring square will trigger is mostly unknown and critical.  It's very similar to various roll-and-writes, but with a fixed deck of path arrangements.  I think, but am not sure, that the deck is big enough that there's no point tracking which paths have already been played to try to predict the likelihood of what will come up next - it's not supposed to be that kind of game.  But I think the deck is better than using a die to randomly determine what shapes come up as I've seen in similar roll-and-writes.  I do wish that they had perhaps made multiple versions of the board, not that different players could have different boards, but rather than one game you could all use board A, then next game all use board B; mix up the location of the guardians, temples, etc.  Easy expansion option.  But I guess the variability is supposed to be in the deck of bonus scoring, that's a pretty large deck, rather than variability in board set-up.  This game is also just asking to made with more laminated boards, since it's a roll-and-write that can play infinite number of players.

RATING: 9.5
For me the perfect family game. Multiplayer solitaire or not - I just love games like Kriss-Kross or Extra!, where everyone has the same starting position and sooner or later is brooding over his very own weak decisions, and so final results may widely differ between players. Family and friends love it. ("I need a 4! Give me a 4! Oh no..." etc.) After playing the initial "Avenue" I got the kickstarter version with extra map and decree cards, lucky me.

I have not played any other game like this one, and it definitely makes players want to go one more time.  Because of the way each person is playing against themselves from round to round, it makes me feel like if we start a new game, I could do better than last game, rather than looking to do better than the other players.  It is quite clever in that respect.

It’s a great game with a lot of excellent map planning elelmenrs built in. It’s easy to teach and the addition of dry erase boards over the paper is a much welcomed addition on top of avenue. The rule cards add some
Great replayability. The dry erase markers that I got in the board seemed a bit dry which is my only gripe about the production value. I don’t know if I just got a defective set or if the markers are just lower quality. Bear I’m mind that you may need to get your own set of dry erase marker, maybe?

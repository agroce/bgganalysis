A nice Clue variant for the Harry Potter fan. There's some cute and thematic artwork. And a few small differences in game play that provides a little unique flavor.

RATING: 6
I don't know enough about the original Clue off the top of my head because it's been so long but my niece is a huge fan of both Clue and Harry Potter so this seemed like a slam dunk after I read about the "Discover the Secrets" modernization of Clue.  This is apparently cut from the same cloth.  Components are a bit lackluster for the cost I paid but I thought the game and thematic integration was solid.  No discovering you're the murderer, our game didn't feature a simultaneous discovery and mad dash to accuse, and the variability with the shifting rooms and tension/game-quickening negative action deck worked out great.  If you're reading this you're probably at least modestly interested, and if so I'm recommending it to you.

RATING: N/A
Others say: too much randomness, flimsy cards, this version screwed up the underlying good game that is the newest version of basic Clue (i.e. Discover the Secrets), and the "dark" cards are too arbitrary... which can result in rapid player elimination just from bad luck in card draws.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Had a chance to pay this, and despite its potential it has a bunch of problems:
- There are a lot of presentation problems. Cards are insufficiently distinct, board print is in miniscule type, and room are hard to distinguish.
- The "dark" cards are too arbitrary. In our game, one player was rapidly eliminated from the game by bad luck. Again, there is little risk management here and a lot of pure random screwage. While neither system is satisfactory, the one in the new edition of the Clue base game is better.
This had great potential, all they had to do was do a nice presentation and not screw with the underlying game too much, but they succeeded on neither count. It's still a decent Clue variant, and Clue is still quite a good game, but the high potential for player elimination and the lousy graphic design conspire to sink it.
---
This was an impulse buy, because I've been enjoying the new Clue: Discovering the Secrets, the the concept of a Harry Potter Clue tickled me. This is because for me anyway, the Harry Potter books often seem to be misfiled under "Fantasy" or "Epic Fantasy", which they really are not - they're mysteries. So having Harry Potter as a version of Clue seemed cool. Mechanically, it also solves a number of thematic and gameplay problems in one shot: the players can't be the perpetrators, the suspects are all NPCs, so no more being jerked around or having to remember if you started in the room or were moved there. And no more winning by figuring out that you did it. The hazard cards are more incremental and more manageable than the ones in the new Clue, so that seems like a big win over the "one in 6 you die" thing, and better scaled for the number of players in the game. All told, this seems like a superior version to the new Clue. The shifting board is thematic, but also has the potential for frustration, so not sure how to call that.

On the down side, they used the same dumb clear-plastic pawns from the new Clue. I really don't like those things, and they're even worse here where they spoil the look. I think I'll try to get some plain old colored plastic pawns.

Anyway, what can I say. it was an impulse buy. I still need to get a regular, plain-old Clue though.

RATING: 6.5
I've always quite enjoyed Clue and this version makes it slightly better. Not a lot, but just enough. You have House Points that could put you out of the game completely. You lose them from Dark Mark cards but can protect yourself against these using Help cards. These add an interesting element while pushing the game along sufficiently. It is a shame there is player elimination, but again it just moves the game along.

RATING: 5.5
Great take on Clue, this Harry Potter one is going to be fun for any fans of the books or movies. I'm not really into them like a lot of people are, but the game is fun and interesting. 

The secret passageways change throughout the game with dials under the board, so that's an neat twist.

RATING: 7
Better then the original because of the added mechanics of moving doors and openings of secret passages.  Not a huge fan of the house point system, Ive been eliminated within a few rounds, but we've made house rules that allow you to gain more, (gain the amount points lost if you use a card) and save others players from losing all of theirs.
     Good game, fun for the family and not too long.

A nice update on Cluedo, which I hadnâ€™t played in about 30 years.  There are lot less spaces meaning the action occurs quicker than the older game, and the ability to travel between rooms by Flue Powder, keeps the action moving along.  Nice Harry Potter thematic touches, such as the rotation rooms, as well as the deck of spells and dark cards, are welcome.  I liked it.

It's Clue.  However, with cool effects, players that can be eliminated from the game, and removes the stupid "I can be the murderer and not know it" by making the prominent Harry Potter villains the suspects.

The only bad thing is you can no longer strategically use accusations to move players away from where they want to go; as a result, since the table usually figures out the answer about the same time, it's a dice-off to reach Dumbledore's office, with little way to stop someone who gets lucky.

I like this better than basic Clue, though.

RATING: 6.3
If you are a fan of the original clue and Harry Potter, then this game should be in your collection.   This is a nice spin on this family classic wherein the rooms can change allowing for secret doors to move and open between rooms.  And with the house point system, players can actually be eliminated from play.  There are Help cards to protect yourself but you need to collect quite a few of these.  Some are better than others in that they can protect from multiple Dark cards.  The game board is nice looking as are the cards.  The player pieces could have been a bit better quality to go with this special edition game but they work.  All in all, not a bad game and breaths a bit of life into this.

This didn't take care of the random nature of how many questions you get to ask.  Instead of rolling poorly, you can have doors close on you just as you are about to make it in there.  In addition, you also can be killed.  So you got that going for you.

On the plus side, I really found it thematic.  So Harry Potter fans will probably enjoy it.

Adds fun new elements to the basic Clue game, if you're a fan of Harry Potter. The shifting board is hilarious. And unlike most reviewers, we love the House Points.

Maybe it should be called the Everyone Dies edition.  It can be hard to even survive with all the curses going around Hogwarts.  In a 5 player game we hurried but still were down to 2 players, one who missed on his guess and only one left to answer who was almost out of House Points and out of the game.  Sheesh.  Next game everyone survived just fine.  Definitely feels Harry Potter-like with the events and changing board.

Clue is a great game. Harry Potter is a great theme. So, that should equal a great game, right? Well, kinda. I do like the characters and most of the cards. The rotating doorways is also a nice twist. But the game still suffers a bit as the classic does: poor dice rolls can do you in and kids may get a bit bored if it's not their turn. Additionally, there is a "house rules" component, which is fairly weak. That is why I give this game a "6", while the classic version merits a "6.5".

24Dec08 - Thanks, Mom! I love what they've done with Clue. Hogwarts has doors and secret passages what open and close, changing the board from turn to turn.

Lose all your points and you're out of the game.

Revamp on the old classic clue (or cludeo) but adds the Harry Potter twist to it, they have done well to incorporate the characters, spells and items of the HP series. I love the House Point mechanism where u can be out of the game whenever u lose all your house points, I find it helps to speed up the game and increased the chance of the game beating the participants. Fans of the HP series and originally game this one is pretty much a must.

Clue, with some added HP themed features. All players have a certain number of House Points and can receive curses throughout the game, which lower your HP. You have Help cards which will protect you from certain curses. Also, the board is constantly changing, (e.g. doors open and close, secret passageways change, etc) which is really cool.

Very much different game than the traditional clue though it shares the hunt for the missing person theme. Each corner room in stead of having a secret passage across to one room, has instead a movable wheel that changes where it allows you to move to. This gives the game a lot more variety.
And of course, for HP fans there are all the main characters to play as.

It's okay. Clue is the mass market game I want to keep around for my son. The variations:
* A timer like mechanism called house points (HP) - if you run out, your game is over.
     *Randomly occuring events (Dark Marks appear) drain your HP, allys like Hagrid and Professor MacGonagal help protect them.
      *If your house points dwindle, you better guess now! 
* Roll and move is modified by the fact that rooms become variably accessible-simulating the moving staircases at Hogwarts! Simulated through a fancy dial thing, pretty thematically cool.

Had a very frustrating experience on my third play of this twist on the classic Cluedo. Having solved the mystery some time before my rivals, I found myself trapped in a room unable to move to the part of the board necessary to make my declaration.

Failing to get the flu powder you need to escape whilst bad luck erodes the lead you built through skill is not a great experience. Don't plan to play again unless forced.

Fun little variation of Clue.  The changes add quite a bit of randomness, but they also add significantly to the theme.  I think it's a net gain in fun.

Unfortunately, the components are pretty poor, especially compared to some of the other themed Clues, like Simposon's Clue.  The players are the question mark tokens from the newest Clue, cards are flimsy, weapons are cardboard tokens rather than little pewter models.  But the most egregious offense is the board, which is a usability nightmare, just behind Indonesia on my list of worst boards ever.  All of the fonts are tiny and difficult to read.  Not to mentions it's bland, bland, bland.

But again, components aside, it's a pretty fun little variation.  Some of the differences from standard Clue: 

1. The suspects are a different set of characters than the players.  This means that you won't be teleported around by people accusing you.  Everyone but me seemed to prefer this.

2. The secret passages shift, and doors can randomly become locked or unlocked.  This is thematic and pretty fun, despite being completely random.

3. Players can lose "house points" through a deck of random encounters.  Lose too many house points and you're out of the game.  You can help buffer yourself from these events by picking up random helper items and allies.  Again, this is all very random but adds to the theme and is pretty fun.  Also adds a small amount of strategy since you can decide whether or not to devote time towards getting helper cards.

This games requires house rules (TBD). There is a highly random aspect of losing house points which cause players to be kicked out of the game due to poor luck. It feels like there is a rule missing (mechanically and thematically) that would allow a player to gain house points and stay in the game; which would save this game.

Durch die Flopulver Mechanik gefÃ¤llt mir die HP Version von Cluedo um einiges besser als das Original. Wenn Cluedo, dann diese Version!

This variation introduces the Harry Potter theme which I love and is very unique. It definitely adds some interesting elements and changes up the traditional game mechanics.  Although still basic, this edition has to be one of my favorites.

Not particularly fond of Clue. I am terrible at it and I have yet to figure out how to properly narrow down things. Harry Potter Clue is a bit better than the normal version, as it adds an element of chance and it makes moving around the board easier. Still, not my cup of tea.

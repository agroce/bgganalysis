This presents many more difficult decisions than the original and also the need for more hints; e.g. "Don't touch this pile!" Or, "Play after I lay down this card; trust me". My wife and I love to play it.

Had fun. Surprisingly long first game for us. Also, I probably had the most fun when one of the players had to play really bad cards. :P

A nice re implementation of the game. Adds a few new rules and ups the difficulty a little. I think I prefer the original more for it's simplicity but will play either just the same.

[url=http://fortressat.com/articles-analysis/2767-idiots]Cooperative games are not games, they are puzzles. And whether I win or lose against a random inanimate/unintelligent algorithm, I am left feeling unsatisfied. I'd rather play a One versus All or a Team versus Team game. [/url]

+ kann interessanter sein, vorallem wenn man häufig "The Game" gespielt hat
+ man könnte nur "Extreme" besitzen & kann damit auch das normale "The Game" spielen
- Regeln müssen im Auge behalten werden

Okay game, not a Spiel des Jahres game for sure, but I do however enjoy it and enjoy playing it solo as well. - Only played without the 'extreme' rules.

Fun little filler.  Enjoyed the teamwork in trying to puzzle out how to manipulate the piles without sharing direct information.  The game does not do anything ground breaking, but it is a fun little co-op game.  I have heard some take issue with the card design and I disagree.  I have a lot of bright, happy, colorful games.  While not necessary here, Skulls are a nice change of pace.

Do you enjoy The Game? If you do than you will probably enjoy this. I don't know how anyone would win this game, it is near impossible! First one was easy but this one is so much harder! It adds a bunch of symbols that effect game play and thus making is super hard. I really enjoy it a lot actually. We lost with about half of the deck remaining. I can't wait to play this game again! I like a good challenge.

I tend not to buy themeless games, but I saw the potential here to find an engaging solo game in which to rehearse mnemonics for the numbers, associating them and then recall (which is far easier in visualised form than just bland numbers), and so far I have improved my score.....

Not sure if the changes add much to the game except to create more chaos.  Sure it makes the game more challenging but there are times where you are just forced to play bad cards.  Not sure if that is fun.  Still, a fun filler game though especially if you haven't played the original.

Excellent game. Quick, tense, entertaining, easy to explain. I just really wish they would use a less macabre artwork. Minus 1 star for the artwork.

[NSV 2016 edition] {Abstract; cooperative; optimal 2-3p} It is a nice cooperative game filler.  Players works together to build a sequence of cards to 100.  It needs high degree of tacit agreement to make it work.  This is challenging enough and its deployability is good.

I don't think I can win this puzzle yet.

This edition is better than the previous one because you can play the basic games without the action cards :)

I prefer more friendly card illustration...

I bought this "Extreme" version because with it you can play the original game and the Extreme version which increases the difficulty. I'm still getting to grips with the base game and finding it very interesting and satisfying as a solo experience. It's playing odds/risk mitigation which is one of my favourite mechanics. The co-op mode will increase the communication aspects which I will likely also enjoy, but even solo this is a fantastic game that I expect to be playing a lot!
'18/01/02: Have now moved to playing Extreme and I'm yet to beat it solo after about 5 games. I love this game for a solitaire fix
'18/01/28: The Extreme version is really tough - I've yet to win after about 20 games. I'm regularly coming quite close now, but no wins yet. Not sure if it's easier in co-op than solo. Fantastic game.

Nice upgrade to the original. It adds many more choices, and it often changes the way you play significantly. It's a bit more luck-based at times due to the card effects, though.

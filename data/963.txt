Good with two, three or four. Lay tiles to maximize points for yourself while screwing your opponents.  Easy, fast and fun with a puzzle-it-through abstract thinking process. Theme independent with Alhambra themed artwork - smart way to repackage a game and make it sell.

Terrible, terrible, terrible game that uses Alhambra for no real good reason. The name is just a sneaky way to make this primitive, pre-school matching tile game into something a sucker like me actually would buy for his Alhambra loving wife.

New edition has some nice artwork but I wasn't a fan of the actual components as it was extremely difficult to place a tile without knocking other tiles out of position. Luck of the draw seems to have a significant impact on overall game play and scoring (one 1st play, drawing the high influence tiles seems better than the low influence ones although there are some clever moves to be made with the low influence tiles). Renaming of the game is a total gimmick to cash in on the Alhambra name, which does a disservice to Alhambra.

A játék első felében azt hittem, lehet (érdemes) tudatosan játszani ezt a játékot, de most inkább úgy gondolom, hogy teljes káosz, szinte semmit nem lehet előre kalkulálni. Az ilyen típusú játékokat ketten jó játszani, 4-en, ahogy mi játszottuk, szerintem komolytalan. De ha eleve így állunk hozzá, hogy ezt bekalkuláljuk, akkor akár jónak is tűnhet a játék, mert maga az ötlet jó!

Unless there is considerable PA most games should end in less than 25 mins (no way 45mins). Very easy to pick up the rules. Little room for forward planning owing to random card draw and not knowing what other players will do. The enclosure of cards that need to be flipped causes some disruption and chaos. Visually cute but very lightweight.

I appear to like all the Dirk Henn games that Queen has developed, and this is no exception. That my overall rating is a bit low is more a reflection on how often I want to (re)play it, not on how much I enjoy it when I do. If we had a smaller collection it would probably come out more often and be enjoyed more.

Like all "pick-up-a-tile-and-play" games we immediately kick in our house rule: "players choose from two tiles in hand and replenish at the end of their turn". This has added to our enjoyment of Carcassonne, Ta Yu, Metro and many many others, and I would not want to play this with the simple draw-and-play option.

p: restating the obvious: nothing to do with Alhambra apart from a desire to recreate sales-figures but graphically it appeals a lot more to me than it's previous incarnation Carat does. But all the pretty pictures can't hide the completely abstract game and players on both sides of the "abstract vs theme argument" might find that irritating.

In essence it is a basic influence-the-multiplier game with the single twist that equal stakes cancel eachother out, creating the option for runners-up to steal the points. Which is also where the fun is to be had, I must say.

Enclosed multipliers get scored by multiplying the amount of trees in the dominant colour with the hut-value. This can create some truely shocking scores; almost lapping the scoretrack in a single turn is feasable. That does feel odd and creates a slight feeling of "no control" as large differences can be undone (or done) in very few turns for no apparent reason, sometimes without a chance to do something about it. Saying that, with a couple of tiles in hand there are usually decent moves available, even allowing for some forward planning. It is equally suitable for 3-players as the neutral colour can still be used to top or cancel out other people's strong presences.

There is nothing ground-breaking in this game, but the way it is executed offers the opportunity to spend an enjoyable 40 minutes. Great filler to chill out with or if you are waiting for other players to show up. 

variant: it might be nice to give all players a drawpile that contains an equal spread of tree-value-tiles. If you get most of the 6 and 5 trees-per-tiles, and  align them so that your trees match the high multipliers, and the other tree colours rest against 1's and 2's, you should on the whole be able to win the game without much problems. Equal draw-piles would make a level playing field. Boom Boom.

RATING: 5
Decent, very light tactical puzzle game. I wish it had a bit more room for strategy. Scoring tiles immediately pays off far better than trying to strategically place high-valued trees in your color. That was the reason I lost—by a landslide. I like the rules for two players, playing with two colors each, and only counting your lowest score. We've implemented this scoring rule for a couple of other games as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very tactical, but there doesn't seem to be much room for strategic planning. It's just as important to minimize your opponent's scores by reducing the number of types of trees around high scoring buildings that you have no hope of winning as it is to try for narrow wins with three or four types of trees around interior buildings. When playing with two players, I recommend each player take two colors and, instead of adding the total scores at the end of the game, the winner is determined by whose lowest scoring color was higher. One quibble I have is that the game is extremely fiddly. Flipping the buildings after they score is a bit of a pain, and it would have been much easier if the building tiles had been made just a little thicker than the garden tiles.

This game gives you a multitude of decisions, it's just that none of them are really any good.  I don't like games where the only move you can do is to worsen the position of the other players in relation to you, rather than better your own position in relation to the other players.   This is one of those games.

It suits us, but this is not the game for you if you don't like a fairly dry numbers exercise.  Making a bad move can bite you more than once, as it will have negative consequences on several scorings.  This makes you want to play very carefully, but that can lead to downtime.  As a whole, the game has a good, simple design and the rules can be learned very quickly.  It forces you to manage how many points you risk giving to your opponent versus how many you might win yourself.  We play 2-player, which makes luck of the draw important.  Although it is not easy to keep the pieces lined up on the board, it looks quite nice as it progesses.  (We have the Gardens version.)

Dull, lifeless numbers/tile laying game that will probably play well with kids, and as such it avoids the "1" or "2" gutter.  There really isn't anything here you can't get in Samurai or Metro, both of which are superior games.  Honestly, this just isn't my kind of thing to begin with so if you like simple tile-laying games, go for it.

Good abstract that reminds me a bit of Batt'l Khaos.  Pasted on themes don't bother me a bit - good fun in this one.
This is a game that calls for the suction cup Nerf bullets for picking up and flipping the point tiles. That can be a pain in the neck otherwise.

RATING: 4
1 play. I came in last, so take this with a grain of salt. This is completely abstract. Game is way too simple for a big box game. Your entire turn consists of flipping a tile and placing it. Not even anything so complicated as placing a meeple. Being in a position to close out scoring tiles is a huge advantage. Felt like way more luck than an abstract should have. Sort of reminded me of Cronberg, but the latter is superior due to choosing which intersections to score, and the variety of space types.

Die Gärten der Alhambra is a simple area control game which is easily teached and quickly played. It doesn't involve much thought, just a little dexterity in flipping over the building tiles. Fun as filler or at the end of a long day of playing games.

After having acquired its parent game Carat at Spiel 2006, I discovered that that version plays a lot better, as the board is so much clearer, and the central influence discs are circles instead of snugly fitting diamonds. The only snag: Carat doesn't have a scoring track... If you like the game, and play it often, I recommend you hunt Carat down. For reasons of ergonomics, Die Gärten gets 1 point deduction; Carat retains the original rate.

Very simple game. Quite pleasant though. Would play again with friends. Quite pretty. 

Would like the bushes to be a bit more obvious (have patterns when they get to 5/6 and take more time to count so you can see how many are there at a glance).

Some real strategy here potentially.

Interesting but VERY abstract game (The theme is completely tacked on, but quite pretty). 
Components are a bit fiddly.
I foudn there to be a bit of a disconnect between the randomness of the tile draw and the mathyness of the way it plays. If i get to play it again i'll suggest the variant where each player has more than 1 tile in their hand.

The (only) game i played was incredibly swingy, i lost by a small margin after having been in the lead for most of the game. I also lost due to kingmaking which was a bit annoying... The last 2 tiles that were played completely decided the game.
The game felt too random and swingy for a game with such clear information and simple decisions during each turn.

Players play a tile onto a gridded board, attempting to take control of the gardens adjacent to the scoring palaces (numbered tiles).  Tiles are gardens that show 1 to 6 trees in the four player colours.  When a palace is surrounded by trees, highest untied tree colour earns palace value by different trees.  Harmless, bit dull (simply calculate relative gain for you), very quick to play, looks wonderful.

The main problem with this game is that only 50% (or less) of the points you will get are a result of your own actions - the others play the game for you by placing your influence, and they don't always think about it.

Aprovechando el éxito de Alhambra Dirk Hern nos recupera un antiguo juego suyo de tema mas bien abstracto y le pega como tema los jardines del generalife, Aunque el diseño del juego es agradable, el juego en si me parece aburrido y tedioso, Piensa uno mas en no beneficiar a los oponentes que en puntuar uno mismo, para el tipo de juego que es le encuentro demasiado sesudo y no va con mis gustos, lo único interesante de él es la duración, que no suele llegar a una hora.

RATING: 5.5
Okay game, slightly boring. I think one thing that it suffers from is that on the last turn, you are likely to end up in a position where you are trying to minimize the number of points the other players might score rather than getting one last chance to up your own score. For some reason that bugs me a bit. Plus I think this game can get stale quite quickly. You wouldn't want to play it several times in a row for instance.

Alfonzo says, 'just when you put this beautiful picture together, you're done and have to put it away'.  Okay, so it's like a jigsaw puzzle that turns out different each time.  I appreciate that the art on every garden tile is unique.
I think there is a little more decision making than Al was saying, but there isn't much.

Elegantly simple design (as often with Henn's games) and lovely presentation. The fiddly counter-turning-over mechanic isn't too intrusive, especially if you can put your finger on a nearby tile and just flip against it. Nice, likeable, and plenty of scope for strategy with the 3-tile variation, but, like Metro before it, fails to feel either particularly innovative or clever. Makes an excellent gateway game.

RATING: 6
Not what I expected from the Alhambra franchise, but a decent game none-the-less.  I've only played once, so my rating is very conditional.  There are some very hard decisions to be made early in the game with each tile draw (forcing ties so that you can score a "2nd" place is a key to winning), but near the end the game almost plays itself... there always seems to be a 'best' move.  It's the lack of tension in the end game that keeps me from rating the game higher.

An enjoyable multi-player abstract. Plays very quickly and doesn't appear to have strong left-right binding or chaos problems. I don't understand why it's so far under the radar - I like it a lot better than Samurai or Qwirkle and a little better than Ingenious. Maybe it has more luck than I'm admitting, given that I won my first play without too much difficulty.

Photos here don't do justice to the board, it actually looks quite nice.

This is near the bottom of my rank list.  I played this on a whim at Gamestorm 2012.  The pieces were difficult to play because they all sit so close together.

I will never play this again and will certainly turn it down.

Nagyon szép, mutatós, ahogyan a tábla megtelik fákkal és a pontokat tartalmazó lapkák épületekké fordulnak át.
Tetszik a pontozás is, hogy többségi egyezőség esetén a felek tulajdonképpen kiütik egymást, és jöhet a nevető harmadik. :) Az is remek elem, hogy a pontszámot meg kell szorozni a körbeölelő fák típusának mennyiségével.
Kiváló bevezető társas, egyszerű, gyors, szép, van benne döntési lehetőség bőven. Persze a szerencse mértéke nem elhanyagolandó, és bizony sokat számít, hogy a játékostársaink mit tesznek a körükben.
Először túl egyszerűnek éreztem, de elég érdekes ahhoz, hogy máskor is leüljek mellé. Kettesben is remekül működik, sőt kiszámíthatóbb az egész. Már akinek ez pozitívum. Nekem az. :)

Others here seem to think this is a straight forward and obvious game. I'm probably too stupid to play it, since to me the moves are very un-obvious and the whole game feels dry and calculating.

Kind of a nice combination of tile placement and area majority -- reminded me of Carcassonne if the coloured meeples were already printed on the tiles, forcing you to place a meeple of each of your three opponents every time you placed one of your own.

Very simple rules. Sometimes you don't have too many options if tiles are only low ones. It is hard to see how many trees there are on tiles when there is more than 3. There should be number printed there to make counting easier. Usability has been sacrified to a better looking game. Never tried "advanced rules" of having 3 tiles in hand. Might make game a bit less random. Could also add significantly to playtime which would be bad.

I personally like game most with 3 players. One neutral color gives some more options. With 4 you usually most also choose what you want to give someone else when you place a tile and that feels a bit wrong to me.

Visually appealing, and not a bad game, I'm just not enthusiastic to play it again.  Rules are easy to teach, but new players (or players not paying attention) can set up the player after them for a scoring opportunity.  Tiles fit tightly on the board, yet you have to flip them when they get surrounded... sheesh!

Sticking the "Alhambra" name on this was misleading, especially since it was released as the actual expansions were being produced.

One of those games where it's so simple, you wonder why you didn't invent it first.  Seriously, if it wasn't for Dirk winning Spiel des Jahres in 2003, this would be my early guess for SdJ 2005.  You can teach this game in 90 seconds.  On your turn you take a facedown tile and place it on the board, that's it.  It plays fast (30-40 mins), great for girlfriends and families and gamers too.  It reminded me alot of Carcassone and Metro - I think if you like either of those two games you'll enjoy this one.  Another winner from Dirk, I enjoyed this one more than the original Alhambra.  Plays great with 2-4 players, probably optimal with 3.  However, some may not like this as much cause there is really nothing "new" with it.

Simple tile placement game that has a very limited amount of decision making. The light weight, luck of the drawn tiles, and chaos, especially in 4-player games, places it at a 5 rating for me.  But it has its strenghts as well: it is a great introductory game, a good filler, takes under an hour to play, and at the end of the game the finished board looks nice. Note that despite the box resemblence with the game of Alhambra by the same designer and publisher, the gameplay does not have any similarity or anything in common with that game. It is just an attempt to capitalize on the success of the original game.

Interestingly, we played it on the heels of Sudoku Challenge, which is a draw-a-tile-and-place-it-in-the-best-spot game with virtually no decision making to it.  In many ways, this game is the same.

Played Carat.  A fairly interesting combination of numbers, some math, and flavors of Raj scoring.  However, the game play is a little dull and the decisions aren't as tense or novel as appear to be.  At least it is very quick, but scoring can take nearly as long as the actual game (as does setup and clean up).  I think I like the game more than my rating implies, but the tedious setup, scoring, and clean up overshadow most of the mediocre game.

The Gardens of Alhambra --  Played once; three-player.  Elegant rules.  Beautiful artwork.

I like Alhambra, and I've liked every Alhambra expansion I've tried, but I had heard that The Gardens of Alhambra actually has nothing to do with Alhambra. It was originally a game called Carat. And apparently it was re-themed, re-named and re-released under the Alhambra umbrella solely to sell copies to Alhambra fans who might not suspect that the games are nothing alike. I have a short list of reviewers whose recommendations I heed, because their tastes often coincide with mine. At the time of PrezCon 2008, none of those reviewers had reviewed Carat or The Gardens of Alhambra, so I had still never bothered to check it out.

My mistake.

Good thing that during our trip to see Jon and Cindy at PrezCon, Jon mentioned that he and Cindy enjoy it. Turns out, it's elegant and engaging. It plays quickly, yet it has satisfying depth. Carat was released in 1993, ten years before Alhambra made Dirk Henn famous. In the years surrounding the turn of the millenium, eurogames surged in popularity among American gamers. It only made sense to re-release Carat after that shift in gaming sensibilities. Some gamers prefer the graphics and components of the original. I very much prefer the Gardens edition. The architectural garden theme changes the game from a dry "colors and numbers" abstract to a visually engaging game with a lush landscape which is beautiful both during placement and after tiles are flipped.  

Yes, I've read some complaints that the garden-themed art sacrifices function in favor of form (it requires more attention to count the trees than to simply add numerals), but I've found that  the number of trees in a cluster can usually be gauged at a glance.  In fact, I think any loss in function is more theoretical than practical. Some people may assume that counting trees will be more difficult than adding printed numbers, but in practice, I find it easier to make a quick assessment of the general value of tiles by noting the size of the colored clusters of trees.

In our PrezCon session of The Gardens of Alhambra, I was the start player, and the initial setup happened to favor the start player. (I've learned in subsequent sessions that this is not typical.) I scored big points early and held the lead for the rest of the game. This does not mean the game was unchallenging. In fact, my early lead made me the obvious target, and we didn't always play nice. The choices were engaging throughout the game. Placing a low-valued tile to decrease your opponents' scores may seem to be an obvious choice, but the available locations often precluded such single-effect placement. Frequently, placement which offered immediate detriment to your opponents concomitantly left openings for them to benefit only moments later. This makes for engrossing play.

RATING: 7
A draw a tile, place a tile abstract with some built-in agony. Each tile features 1 to 6 trees in all 4 colours. The trick is to place your trees against scoring tiles to maximum benefit whilst hosing others. Pain is compounded by the fact that you sometimes have to give an opponent points in order to score.

The tiles are lovely to look at but the fact that one must flip scoring tokens is annoying and constantly shifts the tiles around the board. Still, a decent effort.

Nice fairly light tile laying game.  A few interesting and difficult decisions to be made: do you go for maximum points or stop someone else scoring big?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A nice abstract game about placing trees in key areas of a garden to get the most recognition.  The scoring dynamic makes placement very interesting, as a player can force two people to tie for winning the area and steal the points by being third.  Very nice, but it's a bit frustrating to pick up and flip tiles that are tightly placed on the board.

Nevével ellentétben semmi köze az eredeti Alhambrához. Lapkalerakós ez is, de teljesen más módon. Nem mindenki saját, hanem mindenki egy közös Alhambrát épít. Amin az épületeken levő pontokat a mellé rakott egy, kettő illetve négy kertekbeli növénytöbbséggel lehet megszerezni. Egyszerű, gyors, nem túl nehéz játék. Megvan benne a lehetőség a keresztbetevésre, illetve más segítésére, de ezek mind olyan esetekből adódnak, ahol magunknak keressük a legjobb megoldást. Jól működött négyen, de biztosan teljesen más a játék két személlyel. Tetszett.

Mweh filler with a botanical slant. Not particularly arabic in any sense.

RATING: 6
A quick game to learn and play. A high luck factor with the tiles. A decent filler that only allows up to 4 players.
Update: I bumped my rating down a point. I find it too light to play even with family. The choices are just not interesting.

RATING: 6.5
Played once with a group of four, but perhaps I couldn't see the big picture and was bewildered by the game, because I came in dead last, fifteen points behind the next lowest player.  I guess I couldn't get any of the multipliers to work for me.

We love Alhambra, so the Gardens was high in our want list - until we played it, and found it too fiddly.

1 play (2er).

A decent abstract, I suppose, but it was annoying having to constantly fix the board. Will try it next time with the variant where everyone has a hand of 3 tiles from which to choose each play.

Shares nothing with Alhambra except the name.

Similar to Knizia's Samurai, you place tiles to add influence to adjacent spaces to collect points. Unlike Samurai, this has less things to track and scoring is straightforward.

Unimpressive game where all you do is place a tile on your turn trying to close out areas to score them.  Way too much luck for the time it took to play it.  Very few interesting decisions.  Quite a disappointment.

Die Gärten der Alhambra.  The 2-player variant (2 colors each) is considered very tactical.  English version in Dec.?  Too similar to Cronberg??

This unexpected tile-laying game has shown real staying power at my house.  The Gardens of the Alhambra is very easy to teach and gives both gamers and non-gamers plenty of enjoyable decisions to make.  The lush depiction of fruit trees adds magic.

A simple fairly-fast-playing but thinky abstract where players struggle to control the high-point buildings by placing the most trees of their own colour around them. Each placed tile contains between 1 and 6 of each of the four colours of trees, one colour per side.

Made much more interesting by the multipler effects forcing players to trade off vulnerability to takeover against getting more points. The tie breaking (all ties are disqualified) opens the path to manipulation as well.

I think the retheme helped the game be less eye-bleeding while still remaining pretty visually clear in practice.

I like this a lot. It's got simple mechanics with quite a bit of strategy and no two games are the same. And it's got pretty colors. Can't forget the colors

Interesting scoring mechanism, especially the decisions necessary to determine the best placement of the current tile. Pretty! It's nothing like Alhambra, but nobody ever said it was. If you don't like mathy games then don't buy this one (very simple math.) I've played many games of this not recorded.

Urrrgh, you couldn't convince me to play this game ever again. The design is just really poor and I quickly got really discouraged at the multitude of colors and swirling patterns. Luck plays too much of a role in this game and just not fun at all. Pass

Dirk Henn (Metro); abstract influence game; formerly known as Caret; Gardens of Alhambra is a good filler game, easy to explain, with some tricky choices. By placing your color flower next to a scoring building, you are helping someone else out with another building; not the same as Alhambra or the other Alhambra games

I only played Alhambra once and picked up this game later at a sale. It is a very light game and a bit fiddely with all the tiles on the board. But it is a very good game to bring to the table with non-gamers.

RATING: 6.5
Provisional rating after one play.  The artwork and theme help hide the fact that, as far as tile-laying games go, this is pretty much an abstract.  It seemed easier to play defensively, rather than play for "the big score."  Is the first player at a disadvantage?

RATING: 4
At least it's short--although the amount of down-time seems disproportionate to the rest of the game.  Spend 30 or so minutes min-maxing where to place your tiles.  Sure to bring out any tendency you have toward analysis paralysis. The best aspect of the game is that the board looks pretty when you're done.

An abstract "borrowing" of the Alhambra brand (there's no overlap between the two games at all), but one that I find a tad better than the original.  Player interaction is much more direct, at any rate.

Played the Carat edition. OK if played fast but each player needs to take their time or they can give the game to the player on their left. Which means it is prone to AP.

RATING: 6
Played once (with 4 players). A decent tile-laying game, which as such suffers from the typical problems of the genre (like, for instance, Metro or even Carcassonne). The luck of the draw plays a huge role (not that some tiles are better than others, but some are just better when you draw them - and during a relatively short game, luck doesn't always balances out), and with more than 2 players, king-making is a very possible problem. Still, this game is a rather pleasant filler.

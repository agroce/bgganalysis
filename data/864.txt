A collectible miniature game. My interest in it was taking those rules and transfering them over to the Heroscape tiles. There it was the center of gaming for me and my game friends for about 2 years. Now - I no longer want to play. Mage Knight without our adjustments - nothing I want to play.

RATING: 7
A very simple and fast-paced skirmish wargame, doesn't need a huge and dedicated table to play a good game, and it lets you play small skirmishes or decent-sized battles as you like. The main "drawback" is the increasing amount of "special powers" that keep balance apart, but besides that it's a good game. I always find myself re-painting my minis, though...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Collectibility was a major mistake with this one, but assuming that all the players have roughly equal-sized collections (or are willing to lend figures easily) it's a winner -- both better than and cheaper than most other fantasy miniatures wargames.

RATING: 5
I'm glad this game exists, because it led to Heroclix, but I don't like measuring in minis games. The grid is much easier. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Simple and light miniature game. The battle system is both quick and flavorful. The clicks make damage checks easy to follow and give units the 'weaken' feeling lacking in most miniature games.

Paintings and plastic quality are questionable.

I was always put off by minis games that needed painting and games which had stat lookups in books and cards. Mage Knight was prepainted and all stats were on the dial of the figurine. Even after 17 years, this is still my go to minis game. Unfortunately MK 2.0 killed the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I'm rating the first version here, based on about 15 months of weekly play back when it first came out.  The collectibility isn't so bad because few if any figures are broken and you can always buy singles from resale websites.  The paint jobs suck compared to hand-painted metal miniatures, but I don't play games to paint miniatures.  The rules are extremely well done and I hear that version 2 is even better.  Very simple to teach. Nice to-hit and damage resolution.  Abilities degrade as damage is taken (which I like better than Mordheim's method or just "hit points".)  No extraneous card for each figure.  The result is a highly tactical game with plenty of choices for creating your band of skirmishers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I bought Mage Knight as soon as it was put on sale, because I was curious about the innovation of "Clix System". Moreover, the idea of combinaning wargaming and TCG elements really attracted me. Mage Knight has pretty simple rules, maybe even too simple. Sometimes I had to look for further guidance on rules because I didn't believe the game could be so "easy". In few times, I lost interest in Mage Knight. What about miniatures? Their quality was poor: painted badly and easily beakable, while the Clix System often became stuck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Downgraded the system. Too commercial now. 
Defensive play is rewarded. Not exciting enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I spend more time making armies than playing the game, though 200 point battles are most ideal. Concept of "pushing" forces players to be defensive which makes the game less exciting than its potential.

Great game. I prefer Mage Knight Dungeons but this is still great.

RATING: 7.5
I don't know why the reviews on this are so low or why the game is no longer produced. This game is as enjoyable as you want to make it and even though the pieces are not a perfect fit they can be used as standard D&D pieces,runescape pieces, and other board games that utilize miniatures. I love this game and would rate it higher if new pieces and or expansions were still being produced.

OK tabletop minis game. Miniatures are not of a great quality. Still the gameplay is easy to pick up and a game once in a while can be fun. Problem is, other mini's games are just that much better.

This game revolutionized miniatures with its attractive figurines, simple rules and mechanics (compared to, say, Warhammer, it's direct competitor) and affordable price. Its big (and for me, huge) drawbacks are its collectiblity and reliance on miniatures-style "gotcha" tactics. Check out Heroscape first if you're considering getting this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I have played this a lot. There was a group of us that started playing it as soon as it was released and loved it.  Then they came out with version 2.0 and admittedly it's a better rule-set, but many of my hundreds of dollars became obsolete overnight.  After that experience I have been soured to collectible games.  At least with jumping on them in their early days.  Wait a year after one of these has come out and buy a lot on EBay for a tenth the price.  

These minis have served in many games.  I have also cut them from their bases and used the models in other games.  The paint jobs are generally good and they are pretty durable.

RATING: 7
A miniatures system that had a lot of promise when it first came out. The "click-based" figure concept was brilliantly conceived but unfortunately tied to a "collectable" marketing/business model that eventually sunk it.

The miniatures game system overall was very well designed and the game play value was excellent initially, until the "suitcase" phenomenon (common to most collectables) and constant rules/edition tinkering quickly sunk it. The player prepared to spend the most money had the better armies - it was that simple. I miss the game but glad I finally woke up to how much money I had wasted on it...

RATING: 4.5
The father of the CMG, Mage Knight was fresh and innovative in its day.  Eventually, though, it grew too ponderous under its own weight, and developed into a cluttered mishmash of rules and poorly-balanced figures before being canceled.  The world it created was (and still is) interesting, but there really is not much else.  I still have my collection of Mage Knight figures, and occasionally use some of them in kit-bashes, but I have little desire to play the game any more.

Collected some of the minis when the game was fist published. The birth of the base-click-mechanics. Was very much fun for a while. Im still happy to have these as we use them as NPCs in some Heroclix szenarioes and as spawns of the Apocalypse Dragon.

RATING: 6
I have a love-hate relationship with this game.  My friends and I played weekly for over a year, and enjoyed every game.  Considering the many cases of boosters, single $25 figures, terrain, and gaming table, I invested well over $1,000 in this game.  When version 2.0 came out, it completely crashed the value (monetary and gaming) of my figures.  Still, I have a huge collection of figures, castles, dragons, and titans.  Haven't played in a while but the game is quite fun.  EDIT: I sold off my entire collection for a fraction of what I paid.

A really cool game to play for those of you who like miniature games like Warhammer. It's easy to learn and fun to play! Neither does it cost as much as Warhammer does...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Was into this for a very short time, basically take the expensive aspect of Warhammer, subtract the inconvenience of painting, and you have Mageknight. 

Like WH the game is riddled with broken figures, and I could never get into it, prepainted figures also meant less individual personality for your force, which is one of the things I really enjoyed about the GW games.

To be fair, I'm not much of a mini gamer to begin with, and I used to find myself roped into these games by more enthusiastic friends time after time until I eventually learned my lesson. Honestly though, booster based games like this are the last thing you want to get into when pre-packaged options are out there.

I like the game much better if you don't play it "tournament style" but instead divvy up your own collection into balanced but "not-cheesy" forces and play a homemade scenario. Game is more of an abstract strategy game than a true fantasy skirmish game but the game is fun and the "fluff" adds to the "suspension of disbelief". Plus the miniatures come pre-painted (poorly, but painted none-the-less) so you get the "miniatures experience" right out of the box (although you really should invest in true miniature terrain for full effect).  Update: Gave away or threw out my figures.

RATING: 5
Used to own this one, and my collection totalled more than 1000 figures.  Then WizKids followed in the steps of WotC and started releasing expansions faster than the average gamer could keep up with.  Add to that the fact that the Unlimited and Lancer figures are now no longer allowed in tournament play, and you have the reasons why I sold everything on eBay.  The game itself was fun, and the figures and original combat dial well-made.  Part of me hates the fact that it's all gone now, but honestly, I have a lot more shelf space now.

Really good collectable minis game for small scale tactical combat. The early figures are hit and miss for style, but the two expansions that are out now have great figs with good paint jobs.

Tried to be a replacement for Warhammer, but the lackluster theme (fluff development) and poor miniatures made it fall short.  The clix were innovative, but a pain to deal with in practice.  Hard to see, have to keep picking up the miniatures, etc.   HeroClix was a big improvement on the system.

Bought.

Pro: Interest mechanic with the click system. Good theme. Decent to excellent quality figures. If the negatives did not exist this would be a 9. Not nearly as much a bucket of dice as Warhammer and has far more reasonably price figures.

Con: It is a miniture game. I prefer games with marked movement simply because its too easy to fudge positions in a mini. This kept the game from being a 10. The second edition set was far more powerful than the first. This pushed the game down to an 8. Collectible figure game. This pushed the game down to a 7. The combination pf collectablity and  mis matched expansion powers was disasterous. If you really liked the game and invested money in buying rares and uncommons as singles you saw their value totally evaporate when the second edition came out. This pushed the game down to a 4.The last collectible game I will EVER buy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Own one starter set's worth.  Mixed in with Mage Knight Dungeons for play in that system.  Not fond of the ruler-style movement.  Game would be much improved with a Heroclix-style grid map.  As it is, very clumsy, and there were some bad decisions made on this game that totally destroyed it.  On top of all of this, I can no longer stomach the collectibility of a game.  Give me the whole thing a box, y'know?

My rating is based on the origional rules system.  I've played the new rules, with the mission counters, etc., and I'd have to rate it a 5.  The origional was a nice, cheaper and easier to play alternative to Warhammer, but in my opinion, the new rules over complicate the game and turn it into a turf war instead of a fantasy battle game.  If you have the chance to play the origional version, don't pass it up.

When new, this game was a great answer to those who like minis but can't paint and don't want to be overcharged by Games Workshop minis. Was quite fun for a few years, but anything collectible these days isn't appealing. Still a great minis game for it's time.

Easy for new players but has sufficient depth to keep skilled players interested.  Really three games in one: Rebellion (skirmish), Conquest (large armies that may also include optional large figures such as dragons and chariots), and Dungeons (dungeon crawling).  Each game type uses the same figures and variants of the same rules, but each game type plays quite differently.  Very high replay value.  Mage Knight 2.0 is an improvement over the 1.0 version of the game.

When this game came out, I was enamored by the concept of this game.  Upon playing it a weekly game night, the sheen wore off quickly.  While the game was pretty ingenious.  The rules felt like they were punched out by monkeys.  And speaking of punching out, this game instigated more arguments and fights than anything else that I have ever played.

The best part of this game was forming your armies.  I would spend more time away from the game table building armies then actually playing the game.

RATING: 6
Used to play this game several times a week.  A decent entry who's main selling point at release was its clean mechanics and short playing time.  Unfortunately, it favored ranged combat and certain mid-priced units too much, which rapidly narrowed down the field of tactically acceptable armies.

The mass-combat version (Conquest) significantly expanded the playing time but pumped some life back into the game.  I had fun with it, but there is a significant increase in playing time and record keeping.

What a mess.  The concept is reasonable and I like Wizkid's system of making miniature games which don't have the same massive investment of other miniature games (even if they replaced the high financial cost and effort of painting with a high cost in collecting).  The problems come in when the game got a massive pile of complexity added with no actual play benefit.  If you can strip it down to some simpler form then it might get a point back but the game as it ended was a patchwork monster with bolted on ideas that didn't take into account the whole.

Bought about a dozen Rebellion starters for $4 a piece when v2.0 came out.

Had 3 storm golems in all. 

Plan on playing sometime, but with a grid instead of those flexi-ruler things.  I HATE having to measure out and knocking your piece over and stuff like that.  Hero Clix comes with this grid, and it works GREAT, so I don't see why the others don't use this system.

I've only played first edition rules, and haven't played it since getting into Euros.  Vastly better than the only other CMG I have played (D&D minis) because the rules are much more streamlined, and there are a finite number of special powers that you have to keep track of.  It doesn't really stand up to a good Euro or wargame in terms of fun:time ratio, but I would still be willing to play Mage Knights once in a while.

RATING: 6.1
This game isn't too bad. Some miniatures were vastly overpowered whilst others were pretty poor. The later releases often made previous figures redundant and the quality of the painting changed vastly per model, it was often pot luck if you got the model painted well, average or poor though at least they always seemed to try harder on the very rare miniatures. Thats another downside, the player who obtained the rare miniatures had massive advantages (I know this as I was one of those players). The click system is a very nice innovative feature but as this game relied on moving via a tape measure, having to pick up the model, click the base and put it back EXACTLY the same was a chore. The rules aren't too bad but this is not a game to be taken too seriously which is a shame as the developers seemed to take it that way.

I don't like movement where you measure, line of sight without a grid or hex board and I don't like firing arcs. I also don't like knowing exactly what my opponent can do at the start. It has no surprises. Miniatures games are for adults who like playing with toys.

I enjoyed the collectability of this one for a while but that is the only reason I am giving it a 6.

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a deck is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

I did not follow this game too long.  Seemed like an even bigger waste of money than the average ccg.  Cool concept that spawned off themed duplicates like star wars/heroclix.

The click-base was a good concept which probably spawned one of my favorite games (Heroclix) but I just didn't have the time/money to build my own battlefields and playing on an empty table was boring (Heroclix solved that problem with maps).  I think I spent more time buying Mage Knight than playing it.

2009 Edit:  Alot of what everyone says about Wizkids and Mage Knight, good and bad, is true to some extent or another.  But in the end the game is great. Collectibles suck of course.

I highly recommend the 2.0 expansions Sorcery and Omens.  They are better than 2.0 base set, and they caused me to up my rating.  [edit: Dark Riders, when played by Wizkids rules interps, is totally weird...use common sense instead or just skip this expansion]

Updated rating after more years of playing.  Great gameplay, replayability, creativity in scenario building and so on.  Awesome.

This is the best tabletop game of all time and one of the best games in hobby history imo.  I'm an old wargaming grognard and I really mean that last sentence.  

The haters below make good points...I detest collectibility too...and, after WK made a good profit, they really let the rules go all over the place.  Good, legitimate criticisms.  The base game is still great however.

RATING: 6
I played Mage Knight when it came out and was done with it right after the first expansion. The game was too simple for my tastes, and over time devolved into the "Big Bound" armies and forces dominated by Corpheus and AD. 2.0 did a good job of fixing many of MKs most glaring problems while adding just enough complexity to make the game more interesting and still be a simple 50 minute affair of flinging dice and having fun. It's collectable so it looses points for that but you can get by with just a starter and a few boosters and have fun.

I play exclusivly 2.0.  The minis are beautifully sculpted, and they are painted very nicely.  The click base system is an excellent invention, something I was trying to do with my G.I.joes growing up by giving them hit points and trying to make them suck as they got hurt.  2.0 adds items, domains, spells, etc that really add some fun customizing abilities to the game, making each battle very different.  The rich backstory to the game is unbelievalbe, and each piece usually represents something that the did in the story.  I've spent a shameful amount on this game, and have nearly every piece including the promos.  Finding players is difficult however, since people tend to only play living games...  Still, I can get my wife to play every now and again and it is always a blast.

I had hopes of this doing the one thing Titan did not - reflect step loss (in the unit's capabilities) throughout a battle. Combat dials do that splendidly. However the overall game rules for this and Heroclix seem perpetually going from one extreme to another. Like Heroclix, I would say house rule your own game and enjoy the great pieces and combat dial system here.

Great concept. Not a fan of collectability, but what're ya gonna do? Played the first set and Lancers and a little bit of dungeons before money/time became an issue. Good times though.

So much to like with Mage Knights. The dials are a fantastic idea and really do take the place of chart searching. The figures are extremey cool.

The activation system stinks. Igo Ugo with no opp fire makes for bland, tactics-limited gameplay.

Tons of rules problems that cannot be fixed, bad figures, "collectable" nature (Read: ripoff!) and a tedious rules system.  This game is the running joke of our game club.  This game is like watching paint dry, or maybe a soccer game.

The first miniatures game I got into.  Loved the mini's, but got expensive.  I liked the accessibility, but ultimately wasn't satisfied with the core rules and ended up using house rules.   The pacing sucked.  Didn't like future expansions.  Then I discovered Heroscape.

The game has good fundamentals but the pointing system of the units were way off, consistently favoring large ranged strikers over infantry. The minis themselves are usually mediocre-to-bad, although later figs are much improved (particularly the large figures). This is a fair game if you want a light fantasy minis wargame, but the balance issues makes it hard to take seriously - these guys really abused the collectible aspect by making 90% of the figs shit, I kid you not. The MK2.0 rules give new bonus abilities to all melee units, and this helps, but does not fix the bad gameplay. 

But hey, you know what? Just play Heroscape instead.

This is a super game. Well thought out & well put together. You can make it as big or as small as you want. We play on a hex mat though. It transfers easily to a hex grid & now we don't have to measure all the time or worry that when we "click the bases on the pieces, that we've moved them from where they should be.

The first collectable miniatures game, this started as a great game, easy to learn and to teach.  But the company's two-faced marketing decisions as well as their pathetic inability to properly playtest new figures for the game so as to keep gameplay balanced and fun killed this game off long before they finally stopped selling it.

An extinct miniatures game for players wanting a less hardcore experience than most miniatures games. Game stats and abilities are tracked on the base dial avoiding the need for massive rule books. Has been succeeded by Hero/Horror Clix.

The revised Mage Knight rules are fantastic. Wizkids took everything they learned over the course of developing Mechwarrior, and applied it to Mageknight's second edition release. For the most part, everything is decently balanced and the changes made to how the different attack types (magic, melee, and range) interact allow for both varied tactics and interesting army building. The expansions however, were not so good. Dark Riders, which added cavalry, was full of unnecessary additions to the game's rule set. There was nothing necessarily unbalanced, just a lot of rules that did not add anything to the experience but complication. Do we really need three intelligence levels for mounts?

No.

Another nightmare provided by this expansion was the introduction of a mount with a charge special ability on the dial, which was completely unnecessary considering all of the mounts already had the ability to charge naturally. The result? An absolute nightmare of special rulings, crazy interactions, and vastly overpowered armies. It pretty much single handedy destroyed the tournament scene, and the game never recovered. The follow up expansion, Sorcery, added spell casting and spell books, but it was also botched. What should have been a nifty addition to the game was actually a train wreck of unnecessary rules. There are three different ways to ready spells and four ways to cast them, a differentiation that added nothing but headaches to the game. If spell casting had been added to the system a little more elegantly, it may have revitalized the game.
Instead, they were ultimately the final nail in the coffin. A couple more expansions followed, but by then no one even cared...

I have fond memories of Mage Knight. After all, it is what initially got me back into gaming after a very long sabbatical. Without Mage Knight, I'd never have played Mechwarrior, never met the core of my great gaming friends, and never have discovered BGG (albeit indirectly). I still like the basic game, but the expansion rules simply suck. I have re-written rules, altered mechanisms, and changed special abilities (with pretty good success) but what good is a game that is 60 percent house rules? If I teach someone to play my way, they are in for a shock if they go elsewhere for a game. Generally I look upon house rules with disdain, so it's difficult for me to continue playing a game that needs so many of them to function.

Mage Crack.  I have a lot of these.  At the time I thought this game was great, but I don't think it holds up.  Much like Magic I think I enjoyed the thrill of the hunt and the organization of the armies (deck building) more than the actual game.  I recall asking at the local Games Workshop store if they carried these minis and I thought the guy was going to hit me.  Obviously pre-painted minis with clicky bases were WAY beneath him.  Funny that.

Tried to get into this in college. Seems I caught the tail end. I bought and few Dungeons boosters. Nothing really come of it.

I like the clix games. It's a really neat concept. I saw some people playing [gameid=7929] and it looked very similar in concept.

Grid-based tactical combat.

Maybe I should have gone with [gameid=3864]

Loved MK 1.0 and collected a zillion figues. Burned out by MK 2.0 (despite being a better balanced and clever design). I enjoy the click base concept and think it worked especially well for a miniature combat game. The sculpts got increasingly more impressive as the series went on.

RATING: 6.5
Mafia City is a nice bidding game with beautiful components. 3 painted miniatures and great quality poker chips do a great job to transfer the theme perfectly to the game. The game has a great catch-up mechanism where players draw more of the very powerful cards. The game probably plays best with 4 players. With 5 players there can be quite crowded places on the board which usually is bad for players with fewer chips.

It is an area control with "take that" cards. The theme fits well in the game and the rules are simple. There is a lot of interaction in this game and the bash the leader exists but no one can loose victory points so the game shall end in polinomial time.

A pure area control game with a mafia theme. Players are trying to control several parts of the city. Each section offers a unique ability to the person controlling it. Players also have some cards that can be used to spice things up. As in most area control games there is a king making issue.

Really interesting cut-throat Euro area control game. It reminds me of El-Grande with a huge dose of additional theme and some ameritrash swinginess. The cards can be brutal and provide for much of the drama, casting a shadow of the very direct and straightforward area majority game.

The area control aspect is amplified due to a clever control mechanism that benefits players being lower in the stack of Mafioso on the location (all deployed gang members are stacked vertically). Additionally, each area controlled offers a thematic special power in addition to the victory point.

Enjoyable game that has you wanting to come back and play repeatedly.

Written review: [thread=1021663][/thread]

Mafia City is an [b]area control/influence game.[/b] You [b]bid[/b] for control and power in the different city regions with your mafioso (represented with poker chips). Cards are used to help accomplish your goals. Clever [b]hand management[/b] and a little bit of [b]card drafting[/b] luck will go a long ways in helping you acquire control the city.

Skillful [b]negotiation[/b] will also be required when trying to deal with the opposing mob bosses. 

*****************************************************
The way in which you can combo the scoring phase of the game really gets me thinking, planning ahead, and trying to second guess what my opponents will do.

It is an Area Control game - during the scoring (Or 'location') phase 7 unique districts are checked for majority control. In the case of a tie, the person who got there first wins majority (with the exception of two districts, where there is no tie break). That person gets 1 VP.

Ok - nothing brilliant yet.

By winning the VP, that person also gets a benefit associated with that particular location (each location has a different benefit). These benefits can often swing and changed the majority of locations that have not yet been scored. So, with some clever planning and outguessing, you can start to cascade and combo scoring opportunities that were not even present at the beginning of the scoring phase.

It is really clever and drives your every decision when placing your Mafioso on the board. It reminds me of the action pawn placement and resolving phase in [thing=104020][/thing].

This game is brilliant in terms of theme and game play, which is all directed at how to maximize and cascade effects (and VPs) in the scoring round in your favour.

This game is delightful. A fantastic interactive game.  All of the rules are straightforward and easy to grasp making the game an overall lighter medium weight. in this category it is an easy 9 for me.  

An area control of sorts but the chip arrangement is crucial, so the investment in area seems a bit more tense.  Each area will give a player a victory point and an ability.  Cards are also crucial.  Card powers are nicely balanced, not too harsh on a strategy. If a player is disgusted by a card, they could have made the choice to invest in drawing more, so as a gang member you should show no mercy, as your fellow players will also destroy you if they have the chance.

This is the kind of game I'd like to see nominated for a spiel des jahres It is easy to grasp, shorter time length, great player interaction, and tremendous subtlety as the story begins to arch.  The last few turns become very intense with players focused on destroying one another.

Very well-designed, amusing and suspenseful bidding/area-control game with some neat little twists due to various action-cards and regions with different effects. The game features fantastic artwork and great production value: the game box is perfectly designed, the components fit exactly into the insert and are very detailed and thematic (pre-painted minis, poker-chips for the gangsters etc.). One of my highlights of Essen 2012!

Auction Game. Solid.  Works well with 5 and 4. Slightly different w 3 -- tighter but still good. One thing is that it takes a bit of time to understand the function of each district -- and also how player order is resolved.  Player aid suggested.

First played at Essen 2012 with the designer.  Immediately purchased it as soon as the game ended and had him autograph the box.  The interaction between players is high, and the opportunities to screw your neighbor are plentiful.  Play is divided into 3 main phases.  The first phase is the action phase and it is appropriately named.  Players use a combination of poker chips and action cards and to bid (or change someone else's bid) on the different locations in the city, each with it's own special power the owner receives in phase 2.  One location gives more cards to his owner, another more men, and one allows it's owner to sell some of his action cards for victory points.  These locations are numbered and are sequentially resolved in Phase 2.  Just because you currently have the most men in one location at the end of this phase, does not mean you will own it by the time that location is resolved.  The owners of the Prison and the Docks have the ability to remove your gangsters (chips) from the board, the latter does it permanently via the Hitman.  Both are resolved (owner is determined and special action for the location is executed) at the beginning of the phase.  There is hope though, the final location, City Hall, controls the mayor, and the Mayor has the authority to resolve the locations in any order he/she chooses.  At risk of losing the business district you control if one of your guys is sent to jail? No problem, with the mayor, you can resolve that location first and take the victory point before the owner of the prison takes one of your men.  While I do have a couple of hard core gamers willing to play 4+ hour games, most of the gamers in my circle (including myself) do not always have the luxury of committing that much time and Mafia City fills that gap nicely and staying under the 1 hour mark in all 12 plays I've had and between 3-5 players.

Area control game with lots of take-that.

Good game though it takes at least a second play to be decent. It's not immedietly clear which tiles/territories are valuable and which are less so.
Only downside really is that the tiles look very colourless from a distance and that the minis don't really add anything.

RATING: N/A
A mafia theme with worker placement + area control of 7 different locations (where each territory controlled has a different power if you have most influence by the end of the round).  A lot of jockeying for position with advantage usually for playing last (however having earliest influence gives you a tiebreaker bonus).  There are several combative tactics and aggressive strategies primarily through cards.  There's also some "harm anyone at any cost" b/c it's a game about opportunity, it doesn't matter if they're in last place or first.  There is also quite a bit of free form discussion or negotiation to persuade others to do what you want, or not want, so be weary of "discussion gamers" making it a negotiation/kingmaking game.

Semplice gioco ma per nulla banale. Veloce e strategico si spiega in pochi minuti e queste caratteristiche lo rendono facilmente apparecchiabile. Al momento è poco conosciuto e sottovalutato ma si tratta di un gioco di maggioranze, forse pecca un po' di longevità con alcuni quartieri più 'importanti di altri'. Gioco comunque gradevole che consiglio.

Well designed and nicely themed game of backstabbing mafia bosses. Rule twists and game material (using poker chips for mafioso was a great idea) provide great atmosphere and two-faced decision making. 

It was rather low on my Spiel 2012 radar but one demo round was enough to convince me. Compliments to the young lady at the Stragoo booth who explained the game to us. It was one of the very best demoes I have experienced in 15 years of Essen-going. Very nice job!

Looks like the average rather abstract tactical filler game with a struggle for majorities aided by special functions which are granted to those holding these majorities. Not sure how much the hand cards make this a game of luck rather than strategy. The folks whom I watched playing seemed to enjoy it though.

About [thing=131232][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=131232][/thing] is an area control/influence game mixed with hand management. In the game, players are mobsters, the chiefs of powerful gangs, and they vie for control of several places in the city. This is done in a very confrontional way as one might expect, as it fits the mechanics and the theme.

And, by the way, there is a fine amount of care in the theme - while the game does get procedural during play, the locations abilities make sense, the cards and even the tie breaker has a meaning theme-wise. Very nice indeed.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Is pretty straightforward: players start with 7 mafiosi (in a 4 players game) and leave 4 out in the recruitment/reserve stack. Then, in clockwise order, in their turns, players will either add one mobster (chip) in one of the 7 city locations or play one card. The card can be played by its text effect or its symbol (which have other uses). Done. That is the game.

Now, after all players have passed (by not being able or wanting to play a card or add a mobster), the round is over. Each location will be score, following order of the number on them. The control of each location is worth 1 point. Also, the controlling player can then use the location ability, which are:

1) Jail: arrest one mafiosi from anyone, anywhere, and put it in jail (won't be available in the next round and won't count for control this round);
2) Harbor: allows to move the Hitman to and adjacent location and, if the player wants and can, she may discard a Hitman card to "kill" (send it to the reserve) a mafiosi in the location the Hitman is;
3) Fight Club: recruit one mafiosi from the reserve;
4) Police Station: the controlling player can look at the hand of cards of any play at any time;
5) Business District: draw 3 cards and keep 2;
6) Gentleman's Club: if the controlling player discards a card with a +1 symbol, she gains 1 extra point;
7) City Hall: the players influencing the Mayor can decide, in the next round, which will be the order of activation of the locations.

The order above is the one the locations will activate. So you can see, with only 7 mafiosi available at first, that losing one to the jail or, even worst, being killed by the Hitman can throw some disputes for influence in certain places way off track of what someone might expect. And how each one has some very attractive feature (the Police Station is the weaker in my view, but do allow to know if you can use a card in someone and if that player will be able to defend, or if the person can use the Hitman, or the Gentleman's Club, so is useful for information as intended; still, is the weaker).

Also, is important to add that, in case of a tie in influence (which happens quite often), the tie breaker goes for the player that added first a mafiosi to that location, that is why player put their chips in the same stack at a location.

Finally, again in the order of the numbers (or decided by the Mayor), per each location, players will decided if they want to take out all of their mafiosi there or keep them. This is done in order from top of the stack to the bottom - and remember that, since ties (that happen often) go to the player nearest to the bottom, staying at one spot may be key to winning a location.

Then everyone receives a card (if there is a single player in last player, this player gains one extra card) and a new round begins. Play will go until the trigger for the game end happens - 13 points, in a 4 players game. The player with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
What place to influence: not only because of the points they can earn, but also for what they can do - both of these things must be added to: who is controlling it now? Who do you want to prevent from gaining control of that spot? If you enter in a fight for control, say, in the Business District with the same player controlling the Jail, you have to consider that one of your mafiosi influencing the Business District will be arrested. Do you want that? Maybe is worth to leave that player alone, and try to control the City Hall, so in the next round you can fight for the Business District, as you will be able to active if before the Jail. Or you can try to control the Harbor, as you will have a big bargain chip: don't send my guy to the jail, or I will kill one of yours. 

These types of thinking and re-thinking and trying to outfox the others is the meat of the decision-making in the game.

In a second tier is the card play. This isn't less important, no, I call it second tier because they are more straightforward - though there are counters to several of them, cards are hard to come by, so is hard to prevent people from using cards most of the time (but not all the time, and a timely block can make all the difference). But the game works so well without them, I almost wish they aren't in the game, and were, instead, replaced by once per game uses of several abilities, and that, by winning the Business District, you could "refresh" one or more - this would cause changes in the locations as well: the Hitman could always be used, the Gentlemen's Club would always give 2 points, the Police Station controller couldn't be target by the Jail ability nor the Hitman. However, though this would definitely give more control in the hand of the players, it would also add more potential to some deep AP and could make a fast-paced game turn into a slog. Still, the heart desires what it desires, and this game without cards is what mine does. Anyway, I went way off-track.

There is the decision of leave a place or not. I considered that, while staying help in tie breakers, leaving gives the player more room to work with, since if a player passes early (due to not having many mafiosi to put on the board), she can be affect easier by changes in the game state, by someone coming heavly with mafiosi to take the place, or by the use of cards.

Finally there are, for those controlling certain places, some important decisions: which mafiosi sent to jail, use the Hitman or not, which order to activate the locations.

Overall, the decision aren't hard to made, but there are several ponderations behind each of them.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Fast-paced game;
- Euro, yes, but with a ameritrash heart - more theme than one might expect;
- Simple rules: easy to understand and to play;
- Clever mechanics make the game feel unique;
- Good production value - the game even come with minis for the Hitman, Policeman and the Mayor, all not truly necessary, but is great that they were included to enhance the visual aspect;
- Lots of player interaction - this isn't, by any stretch of the imagination, a multiplayer solitaire.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Full of "take that" cards;
- There can be some "bash the leader", but at least the points are open, so the real leader is being bashed (unlike what can, and most often do, happen in hidden points game like [thing=40692][/thing]);
- Catch-up mechanism is weak: usually one single card more, and there is no way to know if the card will be of help;
- There is the possibility of a real fist fight, as the game is mean! Ok, not all that much, however, is true that [thing=131232][/thing] isn't a family night sort of game, and will be more appreciated as a gamers game.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Indeed like a mobster trying to take control of city! If this isn't the best compliment the game can get, I, at least, can take of a better one.

You think you can trust someone. You made a deal with him: just stay out of the Harbor, and I will keep my mafiosi away from your turf at the Business District - I don't like those yuppies anyway. And just when you thought you could concentrate you forces in take out that bastard recruiting like a madman at the Fight Club, your "friend" with a false sheepish look on his lying face puts a chip in the Harbor. "I only got Hitman cards!", he says, as an excuse. "But that is even worst!", you reply. "I won't kill [i]you[/i]", he says. "How can I trust you now?", you interjects, seeing that you three mafiosi in the Harbor will receive the weight of 4 yellow mafiosi. And you aren't even in the lead, and now you got to deal with someone backstabbing you and promising he is legit, while trying to squeeze points elsewhere, or enter in a fight were everyone will be losers at the Harbor. Theme, man, theme!

As it might be already clear, we liked [thing=131232][/thing] very much. It is unique, has little in matters of rules, but offers a lot in gameplay, interaction, meaningful decisions, and all in a very reasonable amount of playing time (around 60 minutes).

Though there are rough edges in the luck of the draw for the cards, the nature of the "take that" and the "bash the leader", well, in this game these things fit well enough. You can't always have the thing you need, and must use what you got; and receiving blows and having to deal with several good-for-nothing mobsters all trying to be you when you are at the top, well, is part of the business. If you can't handle, you should consider leaving town and never to come back, or your soft belly will be even softer with some river water inside of it.

After all, this is [thing=131232][/thing], and is recommended.

Suprisingly quite easy to get into, but with interesting decisions. I'm still unsure about the cards, lucky draws definitely influence the game, but the winner is still decided through tactics, reading your oponents and backstabing (and a bit o luck as mentioned). I'm glad I ate through a pile of cereals to get this game even though my girlfriend won't play this.

** Abstract strategy game with pasted on theme **

Mafia City is a 90-120 minute abstract-strategy area control board game that pits players (min 3, max 5) as Mafia bosses vying for control over a fictional city made up of large Hexagon pieces (locations) in order to win Victory points.

Dependent upon players, players will try to be the first to a set number of Victory Points (ie: 10) and each round a new first player will start the round and play always continues clockwise.

A player wins 1 victory point for every hexagon they control outright (majority); in a draw its the person who got their first. Each location has some kind of power or benefit that the controlling power will be able to use.

There are 2 hexagons which do not follow this rule, and thus no-one can control the location but may be able to get some kind of benefit from it.

Each round is broken up into phases,

1. Action
Players will put their coloured poker chips onto spots they want to control, players can also play cards or discard a card or pass.

2. Location
Each location (hex) is resolved in numerical order; the player who owns the mayor can control which hex gets resolved and in what order.
Resolving it just means the player who has control gets 1 VP and undertakes the power of the location

It is important to note that the players poker chips on the locations do not return to the player after each round; instead they stay at the respective locations and players only have a limited number of chips; but can recruit more from the reserve.

3. Strategy
Each location, players can remove one, some, all or none of their respective color ; but the player with the mayor resolves the order of the locations first.

Players can also play cards, cards have two uses: the text it says (when it can be played, etc), and icons. The icons do various things, such as removing a disc, cancelling a reaction card. In all cases, the icons need to be paid in matching pairs to undertake its respective action.

Okay, down to my review. I didn't like this game. Maybe I need to play it with more players; it certainly is a game that does not work with 3 people, you need at least 4 or the maximum, 5.

Here's why I didn't like the game. It's very abstract and the theme is pretty nonexistent.

I never felt I was in the "mafia", the box art looks super awesome and gives the player the idea they will be selling illegal cigarettes off a truck or maybe setting up rackets, or doing other "mafia" things; but honestly none of this happens. There is no sense of progression, or money or anything like that.

Its just an abstract area control game with a mafia pasted-on theme; and its a race to get a certain number of victory points. Its also very repetitive. I am very disappointed with the game but I will try to play it with the maximum number of players; maybe this game only shines when its at the maximum number of players.

I would play it again, but its not a game I want to keep.

Now sold.

This is probably my favorite cooperative game. It takes Hanabi and flips it into a deeply tense and thematic game. I've found a lot of players don't like the stress of the timer, but for me and a few friends I play regularly with, it's perfect.

Edit (09/2017)
After many more plays of this game, I've only become a greater fan of it. The missions that are included with the game offer such amazing progression and variety. I've purchased a second set so that when I'm done playing and replaying all the missions, I have a bunch of extra parts to design my own.

This is a great game that I really enjoy playing.  The key is that you have to have the right group to play it with.  I have two gamers that I play with that seemed skeptical when I brought it out, but then we tried it a couple times, and then we played it again and again.

The timer is a riot, and arguing over a move is not an option because the bomb will explode soon.

A major surprise for me. I was expecting to hate this game after hearing some initial reactions to it. After crunching about six plays into an evening though I can say I definitely love it. The theme gets a little odd in places, but the gameplay is so stressful you really feel the tension of the situation, especially with the app as a timer. Will gladly play this just about any time. My rating here could definitely go up. My only negative is that the initial print run has a frame for the board that doesn't actually fit the board. Hopefully TMG will remedy the situation. I hate feeling like I got a lesser product as a KS backer than 2nd printing buyers.

Found via Kickstarter and am VERY intrigued.  IMHO, there are only two cooperative games worth playing: Hanabi and Space Alert.  The reason is because it minimizes the dominant player effect as a result of imperfect information (Hanabi) and time constraints (Space Alert).

I've read through the entire rules and am very excited about blending two of my favorite games.  Optimistic about this and may actually try to do a print/play.

Unsure.  Perhaps another real time game too far.  Hard.  It's bad enough trying to keep track in Hanabi, but the "double blind" effect here is a killer.  Probably needs more plays, to be fair, and my score may improve if it proves less nasty.

A further play - with the programming face up - shows promise.  There are strategies here that will work.  I was gonna bin it, but I want to try again.

The last 3 plays have been great.  We won twice, both the Alpha and Beta training missions BUT we played Beta face up for programming.  None of us want to play a memory game, and it's tough enough at present without that.  But looking at the character cards I see there are quite a few abilities to mitigate that issue.  And we did win with a couple minutes to spare so I can see us upping the difficulty and ever going blind over time.  The key is fast decision making.  AP kills.  If you can't think of what to do, just give intel, because you lose nothing and the game moves on.  Definitely a game with winning strategies, as I'd suspected.  Rating going up a bit.

Unpublished prototype at Geekway 2014.

Using a timer and not limiting hints make this a unique take on the face-out cards concept. Hints being given out rapid fire, you're trying desperately to remember what's been hinted, what's been played. It's immense, frantic fun. 

Could use a few tweaks here and there, but even the PnP was very strong. I hear it's on Kickstarter in Aug., I'm going to be backing it day one.

Update: Had some issues with the production. A rare miss for TMG in that department. But the game shines as much as ever. Played with the roles and almost found them to make the game too easy. Still, it's a fantastic one to play.

Rating could go higher based on further plays, however there can be difficulty in getting this game played. I believe that it appeals to a narrower group of people, who don't mind the stress of real time (though it is less stressful than Escape) and also don't mind making errors. With the right group it can be quite hilarious as you give out clues which seem to be forgotten instantly, or you rearrange your hand to make it easier to remember, but then forget how you arranged them as you are under pressure or focused on something else. You end up prioritising hostages when you are down on time, and there is a lot of ribbing going on when people inevitably make errors.

Side note: I used one of the 'pod' figures from Thunderbirds as the robot. Much better than the robot chit that comes with the game.

Bomb Squad doesn't beat around the bush which given its timed nature is a very good thing!  Each turn players have one of four actions to play.  It is clear that a huge amount of play-testing and streamlining has gone into the game as there are no unnecessary rules.  There are similarities to Hanabi (co-operative, deduction, players can't see their own hands) with cards being used to program a robot.

This game is brutal as there is a time-limit (I have to add the caveat, we have not played with a time-limit yet because we are not fast enough to make those times).  You are going to want to have efficient team-work, preferably having played a lot of Hanabi.  With that said it would have been nice to see an alternate timing method with a more cerebral, artificial time-limit either imposed by the deck of cards or an allocated number of turns.  Oh, and don’t make mistakes!

I can't wait till we get good enough to do it against the clock because I can already see it is going to be one heck of a ride! :-)

So very, very good.  I can see this getting a lot of plays as it just appeals to me.  It is a fantastic cooperative game where there cannot be an alpha gamer, plus the real time nature adds to the tensions and really brings out the wonderful theme.  Has garnered mostly very positive comments from those I have played it with, although the high levels of tension and the need to memorise a lot of information can be off putting to some.

Frantic, intense Space Alert meets Hanabi.  Harder to remember your hidden cards (and what has been played) with time pressure.  One person with AP equals certain doom, so this is definitely not for everybody.  This is the type of game you'd have to play repeatedly with the same people because of the learning curve.

A really nice twist on the Hanabi mechanic, this game combines that uncertainty of information with a programming movement game akin to RoboRally. Unlike Hanabi, efficiency of actions comes not from giving a few well-though-out clues, but rather from giving many clues as quickly as possible. The game is played in real time, and so the speed of clue giving is crucial and a few duplicate clues won't really hurt anything. This game is frantic, with less room for clever clues than Hanabi. I found this to be a very enjoyable experience and a strong contender for the best real-time game I've ever played.

RATING: 6
I really wanted to like this game because I love Hanabi, but this game is not Hanabi. It is a frantic memory game, not a deduction game.

In Hanabi, the goal is to always play cards in their numbered numbered order. You also do not need to remember exactly what a card is--if it plays, play it. If it is junk, you can junk it.

In this game, you need to remember what the actions of your cards are and their color [ie: number]. Because the number doesn't correlate to an order they need to be played in, the number wasn't helpful to arranging and putting into temporary memory, but important to know. Also when you discard a card, you need to remember its attributes if you want to get any recharge on  the robot's batteries. Oh, and you hold six cards in your hand, not 4 or 5.

I've only played the game once, the basic scenario. Won with plenty of time to spare. I'm hoping the game will get more interesting with the later scenarios, but am not going to hold my breath on it.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (September 2016)

Bomb Squad is an ok to good cooperative game! It takes Hanabi´s core and takes it to the next level!

The rules are pretty easy to teach, you can do it under 9 minutes. Playtime is very fast and can be around 20-30 minutes (due to the different scenarios) including the setup. I hate when the rulebook doesn’t have a detailed list of components, that’s not too much to ask, is it? There is no way to verify if the game is complete when you buy it second hand!

The components look great, but I dislike the puzzle frame. The frame suffers when you assemble/disassemble it AND in my copy of the game the puzzle pieces don’t match :(.

The theme is fun and engaging! It is much better to use the free app for the game, but any timer will suffice.

Bomb Squad is a scenario based game, perhaps once I have played all scenarios the game will no longer hold my attention, but I doubt it. Trying to accomplish the mission was a lot of fun! The game is hard, so playing through all the scenarios will take time. There are also characters power´s adding to the game´s variability/replayability.

The decisions needed to play aren’t very complex, but as you have limited communication and have a time constraint, they are fun to make! Bomb Squad is full of tension and as you play your cards face down, you have to have a good memory (I love this).

Bottom line, Bomb Squad is a solid game and I will keep it in my game collection. With more plays it can even get an upgraded rating from me. It takes Hanabi´s engine and build around it to offer a more thematic experience. Beating the game isn’t easy and it has lots and lots of replayability. The puzzle frame didn’t work for us as it can easily get degraded. Bomb Squad is one of those games that you want to play again as soon as you finish it!

Rescue the hostages and defuse the bombs in the time given. The catch? You can't see your cards and need others to hint them for you. It's really a combination of Habani (card hinting) and RoboRally (program cards for play) with a timer [not included].

PLUS: cooperative real time forces all players to focus
MINUS: timer not included, not good if you have players who want to strategize/can't remember what cards they have

Bomb Squad 當做花火的進階版實不為過，加入限時的要素讓整個遊戲變得更為緊湊，花火的小技巧在這個遊戲得發揮的淋漓盡致才行，玩家扮演拆彈小組利用卡片編程以操作機器人從事拆除炸彈、破門，解救人質等危險又緊迫的工作，由於看不到自己手上的牌，因此必須技巧性的提示其他玩家，除了記取打出機器人需要的動作，還得顧慮機器人的電量是否足以完成任務，這在限時的遊戲過程中並非容易的事。
跑過訓練任務後，感想是這個遊戲實在不適合人太少，否則要記得多又雜，實在是很具考驗的遊戲～

I am surprised by this game. I don't understand why there is no cost associated with giving clues, aside from spent time. Players can easily take several lightning fast rounds of giving clues to obtain information about their hands. I can't imagine not doing that. It's bordering on a broken game in my opinion.

Throw Hanabi and RoboRally in a blender.  If that sounds fun to you, then this might be a game for you!  :-)  A cool timed cooperative game where you don't see your own hand of cards, but you see everyone else's hands.  Giving clues as quickly as possible to get cards played to gain battery and programming moves for your bomb squad robots to maneuver around buildings to disarm bombs and save hostages before time is up!  A number of scenarios (with varying difficulty) keep the game fresh and challenging.

One issue I did have with my first printing of the game was that the tile frames were a bit too tight to contain the room tiles.  Thankfully, TMG did make fixed frame pieces, which they sent me, and now everything fits perfectly.  :-)

A fantastically fun, yet somewhat stressful game of programming a robot to rescue hostages and disarm bombs. On paper, it all sounds so easy, with the exception of the timer... but in practice, it is a hairy, complex, and fun exercise in player communication and action.

This is an inventive co-op. We had fun with it. In the end, it went up for trade for a few reasons. The first is that it started to feel samey after a few plays. Even with the different scenarios and robots, the strategy of how you used your cards always stayed the same. The second is that we didn't like how sometimes winning or losing was decided by card draw rather than by how well we were playing. And finally, it felt a bit unbalanced for two players. For example, I expect the card draw luck problem would be mitigated with more players, having more cards. The difficulty would also vary based on having more players with more special abilities. It felt like the two-player game should have added time to the missions.

(7/16) 6. I was excited about this game, but my one play fell a little flat.  The combination of high tension+real time+a touch of fiddliness might be too much.  Gonna give it another try.

Estimated shipping "April 2015" - arrived in December 2015. KS also includes the bonus game "Bomb Squad Academy" for free.

This is the only "Real Time" game I will play. I cannot stand Galaxy Truckers and I won't even try other RT games because it puts me under a kind of pressure that I don't enjoy. This changes in a Co-op, so maybe something like Space Cadets might be OK.

The Android App for this game is awesome, I couldn't imagine playing without it despite it not being a requirement to play the game.

I've played the training missions and the first Scenario. The Scenario is easier to win at than either of the training missions because you don't have to rescue all the Hostages. We play with the Variant: No Programming, because I hate memory games and I'm trying to remember enough without also having to remember which Instructions have been played face down.

It took a while to get into a "technique" with the game because we've played quite a lot of Hanabi. While Bomb Squad is "Hanabi meets Roborally" there are some significant differences - particularly the method of recharging the main battery.

A fun and challenging real-time game. You have to play fast, but I feel like there's more emphasis on also being careful and actually playing the game than other real-time games I've played. It's not just frantic nonsense; it's actually a fun game.

Realtime Hanabi RoboRally.  Kind of.

Your cards are face out and you give hints in the fashion of Hanabi, but instead of careful hint planning, there is no limit to the number of hints, so they happen much more frequently.  You then use your cards to create a program which, when run, commands a robot to move, open doors, rescue hostages, and disarm bombs.

This is fantastic fun with the right group.  It requires tight teamwork, plays quickly, is very tense, and failure just makes you want to do better.  If you like real-time games, this is definitely one to try out.

Created a PnP for this one.  Elements of Hanabi (cannot look at your own cards) and RoboRally (programming a robot to cross a room, open doors, rescue hostages, and defuse bombs), with a real-time countdown.  Frantic, and fun.

Un jeu vraiment stressant! Essayé à 3 joueurs. Il faut désamorcer des bombes en équipe avec des cartes dont on ne voit pas nos propres infos. Un mélange d'Hanabi pour comment on donne les infos, Robot Rally pour la programmation des actions face cachée et EScape pour l'aspect timer (avec l'application c'est pas évident de se concentrer). Il faut se concentrer sur nos cartes, la programmation a faire, les infos que les autres joueurs se donnent pour pas donner les mêmes infos et gérer la batterie du robot! Wow ca fait beaucoup. Un bon jeu que j'aurai plaisir à rejouer mais que je n’achèterai probablement pas. 3/4 semble une bonne configuration, plus de joueurs cela doit devenir vraiment ingérable :)

Got this game after finally trying and enjoying Hanabi.  This game takes the hidden information mechanics from Hanabi and takes them to a more enjoyable level for me.  I like the tension the timer brings, but also like how the card play is not as punishing when you make a mistake.

Group enjoyed it - was chaos at the start, totally underestimated the time pressure.  Second game went a lot smoother as people got into the flow and swing of things.  Great cooperative lunchtime game.  I really can't say it enough, but this makes a great lunchtime game.  The time limit helps, and when there is a minute left, you know the cards are available to play but it needs to go around the group.  We are really enjoying this.

Co-op and timed. Hard to get people moving quickly enough to make this game work. You really need to move fast and have an excellent memory for the cards in your hand. App is helpful for sure, though not entirely needed. Played the first mission and won that training mode. Played mission #4 before that one and lost miserably. A game I will have to revisit sometime. Hard to get to the table though.

Test played the prototype. I like it and will probably pick it up.

Pros: Fun filler, and the first training scenario plays especially fast and smooth.

Cons: In the second scenario, it feels like there should be a penalty for reordering the already programmed cards. It seems strange that you "program" the robot, but then can change the order of the cards with no penalty when you activate them. This actually felt like a disconnect from the theme. Savvy players will manipulate this. Also, the programming scenario slowed down the feel of the game play, despite the timer.

I will enjoy seeing the finished version.

If you LOVE Space Alert, and want to add a Hanabi like challenge to it, this is probably a game you will love, but I just found it frustrating and annoying. 

We played the same scenario twice. The first time we lost horribly cause we spent so much time trying to figure out how many moves each colour movement card was (there is a number on the card, but it's located where the player's hand is and you can't ask them to move cause then they know what they are holding). We added a legend onto the board for our 2nd play, and that helped. We diffused both bombs, but none of us enjoyed the game.

Was excited about this at GenCon (having played it there) but the final version did not hold our attention as much as I thought.  Also, component issues with the frame that holds the pieces have not been resolved.

Bomb squad tries to combine Hanabi + Space Alert, two of the few games I rate 10s. So this should be a huge hit for me. Instead, the mix misses what, to me, are the fun parts of both. Hanabi is all about trying to come up with clever clue to convey as much information with a single clue as possible. In Bomb Squad, time is the only limiting factor on clues. Trying to think about your clue is wasting time. Better to give the simplest, most straight-forward clue possible to minimize time. Space Alert is about trying to decide, in limited time, how to use limited resource to challenge a variety of threats. There are lots of approaches to take, and much of the fun is in deciding what to do. In Bomb Squad, the routes are fairly straight forward. So you are just trying to get the cards in the correct order.

About [thing=142267][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=142267][/thing] is cooperative game of a [thing=98778][/thing]-type: players don't see the cards they are holding but see the others, and can give clue, play or discard them. The thing is: [thing=142267][/thing] tries a more thematic approach, while using the same basic premise.

In [thing=142267][/thing] conversation is still limited, but the number of clues isn't - the pressure doesn't come from blind discards after the clues ended, it comes from the timer, as the bomb is set to explode and limits the available time for the players to coordinate, and the programming of the robot, as is possible (even likely) that not everyone will remember what was already played and what is still needed.

There is true cooperation in [thing=142267][/thing] and the hidden information aspect and the limits in conversation mostly prevents the rise of an alpha player.

The addition of theme brought also the addition of stuff: the box, while not huge, is several times bigger than the tiny one for [thing=98778][/thing]. [thing=142267][/thing] comes with several tokens, cards for special roles and, most importantly, tiles for the scenarios and for the robots. Therefore, the heart of [thing=98778][/thing] has been transplanted to a much bigger body - still, the heart beats the same.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
After choosing a scenario and setting it up, players can, in their turn, do one of these actions:
- give intel;
- play card;
- discard card;
- activate the robot.

Give intel is the same as giving clues in [thing=98778][/thing]: you must pick a type or a color, and give a clue regarding all the cards in the hand of the player you are giving intel that fits the criteria.

Cards are played in a row, face down, which is the programmation of the robot (the things it will do later). A discarded card, if the player can say what it is, gains one energy to the robot, which is normally necessary, as activating the robot spend energy, and if it runs out of it, the game ends in defeat.

Up to a point, once the activation starts, a programmed card can be discarded. This might be important as all cards must be used, and if they can't, the ones that can't make the bot lose 2 energy.

The goal of the scenarios change, but usually is deactivating all the bombs, with some adding the rescue of the hostages or maybe other things. The scenarios end in defeat if the time runs out or the bot has no more energy left. Plays win if they fulfill the conditions required in the time given.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Which clue to give and to whom. What to play (remembering what was already played). When to activate the robot and in which order use the programmed cards. When and what discard, which is important to keep the battery of the robot going.

Overall, the decisions aren't hard. What makes them difficult is the added pressure of the silence and the time running out.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Constant cooperation;
- No alpha player;
- Even while being scenario-based, the game provides a high amount of replay value, not only due to the nature of drawing cards, but also in respect to the number of scenarios, the different types of situations and the star rating (points), unique for each scenario;
- Good production value;
- Short playing time

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Real time: the pressure of time running out doesn't fit well with everyone, specially those wanting for a more relaxing time while playing;
- The gameplay tends to be more chaotic, not like the precise cool of [thing=98778][/thing], as clues must be given fast, even if not the best ones to give, and remembering the cards, specially after activating the bot, is a challenge in itself.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Is your first day on the job, and you get to operate the robot. However, the communication is down and only fragments of informations come from time to time. You don't have a clear picture of everything that is going on, and yet you have decisions to be made, as the clock is advancing - the bombs might go off any minute now. What do you do? What? Do it fast! Come on! Now! Go!

Sure, [thing=142267][/thing] has stress, but isn't the kind you will find in a control room for airplanes. No. Is the kind one might have while waiting in line for a movie when there is no confirmed seats - you are in a hurry and likely wanting to get there fast, to get a nice place, but there is truly no major worries regarding the experience. Still, you might not want to put yourself in a situation you have to be hurried and need to act fast. Many don't and find the overall experience more tiresome than fun. Real time games will usually have this issue for some.

For me [thing=142267][/thing] worked pretty well. On our first foray into it, we played several times and wanted to play again, but we didn't have more time (oh, the irony!), which is a mark of a winner - as replay of games isn't a thing in my gaming group. I like cooperative games and I enjoyed the real time and hidden information aspects in [thing=142267][/thing]. Therefore, I do recommend it.

Cooperative card driven programming of the bomb squad robot to save hostages, open doors, and defuse bombs while conserving battery power. By no fault of the game, this one will never hit our table. This game uses every mechanic that my wife and many of our group deplore.  And, it uses them all at once; blind information, memory recall, limited communication, programmed movement, and count down timers! All that is missing is conveyor belts and disintegration chambers. Personally, I'd give this a go.

This is very similar to Hanabi in the game mechanics, but with stress as a factor instead of brain. I very much enjoy the theme. The replayability is great! However, the game is a bit easy with certain systems, which also makes the game the same every play. The challenge in Hanabi appeals more to me.

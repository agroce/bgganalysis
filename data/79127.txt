RATING: 6.5
The genius of this game is that the mechanics work so well with the theme. However, the setup takes about 30 minutes and the two full games of it that I've so far played have both taken 3 hours. 

On the whole, though the game is probably not as bad for this as many others, I still found the amount of small details (particularly the ship power settings) to be fatiguing to deal with.  

Its not a bad game, but I don't know how much more I'll be playing it - I had another game-night right after my latest play of this and we played three games of Ghost Stories and one of Claustrophobia. There was a powerful contrast with the Fleet Captains session (by the end of which I really didn't care who won and just wanted a break from it)... we didn't have to squint or think about rules with the two shorter games - we just focused on the experience and had fun.

Fun game marred by crappy components. I really enjoyed playing it, but the models snapped when looked at and the card stock was tissue then. Sold it to finance other portions of my collection.

RATING: 5
Awful mass-market production...arrived with broken minis, minis broke effortlessly during play.    Visual design may have been professionally done but the results are horrific:   extremely poor font choices on the clix wheels and on the cards, plus, there's no reason to have the game title on the back of every exploration tile.   There's just a lot to hate in the production, so I give it a ZERO.

For gameplay, I give it a 10. 

Thus, this game is a 5....

RATING: 9.5
[2-4/6] Note: Use FFG standard sleeves (silver).

First play: Klingons open unstable wormhole IN a stable wormhole setting off a whole chain of insane reactions. The Federation begins to complete multiple missions (though choosing to ignore a distress call right outside the command post) quickly getting 8 of the 10 VPs needed to win. The Klingons attack and obliterate a pair of ships to bring it to 8-7. The Federation is on the brink of victory with the Defiant developing a Warp Experiment and transporting an away team back to the ship to make it 10-7.... However, since the Klingons went second, they have one more shot to match the points to win. They all power to their engines to get to the Defiant, blow it out of the skies to detonate the Warp Experiment before it is completed, getting them 1 VP for the burning ship and 2 VP for the failed experiment, winning on the very last dice roll.... 

BRILLIANT.

This game would be a 10 if it wasn't for the quality of some of the components... So far it's 9,5 for me and it's the closest thing to my "grail" game. Definitely most cherished part of my game collection. It's got the things I love: Star Trek theme and modular board, not to mention spaceships and fantastic gameplay. It needs a lot of space for setup but it's always worth it!

Rating after 1 play: Thoroughly enjoyable game.  Loads of variability in design, excellent mix of card distributions and just enough luck.  My only complaints are that the game feels a bit "fiddly" with many ambiguities in the rules.  And that font is eye-wateringly dreadful.

Apart from those small negatives, I really am excited about my next few games and exploring different strategies.

Play as normal, but add cloak tokens all over the other side of the map.
4 tokens would be real ships and 6 tokens would be ghosts. Each token would move with a simple die roll. If a token moves into a space with a fed, it's flipped. If it's an echo, it is removed. If a ship, it attacks. The feds could initiate attack by using the standard sensor scan to flip it. The tokens would only move in a forward direction, never backwards. 

1-2 = forward northeast
3-4 = forward east
5-6 = forward southeast

however a fed presense would trump this roll. If there is a fed ship adjacent to the hex that contains the token, the token moves into the hex with the fed and does not roll for movement.

RATING: 6
Unimpressed with this one, as if the game design was not quite fully developed.  Play seemed a bit too random with encounter cards, a bit too fiddly with the mechanic of constantly asking players to study the columns of ships (?), and a bit too solitary in play with wholly asymmetrical goals (presumably, as you get better at the game, you study your opponents goals and try to thwart them.) And though I respect the somewhat creative combat approach in this game, it was simply not fun as a mechanic.  This would be in contrast to the creative combat approach of Game of Thrones which was kind of fun.

And I agree that the components are inexcusably flimsy. Just put the hexes on cardboard, and  make the cards thicker! And yes, a ship broke on the first play of the game, and yes, turning the dials on the ship just does not work...literally...and as a gaming mechanic.  Perhaps true Trekkies like to fiddle and fuss with their fragile plastic ships?

Still, if you are a Star Trek fan, this might be the best Star Trek game out there, and you definitely should try this game.  But...IMHO, Eclipse and Game of Thrones do a much better job of capturing their themes.

Played a number of times now.

It continues to be quite entertaining and varies considerably from game to game.  In a good way.

I am enjoying the various strategies and general feel of the game.

Outstanding replay value.

On the negative side, game length/downtime can be an issue when playing with four players and it's a little tricky to keep track of all of the actions each of your ships are allowed to take.  Some actions (E.g. adjusting your ship settings) can be taken by all ships every turn, while others (attacking) may only be executed three times, no matter how many ships you have.

Basing this entirely off of the one short game I played:

This seems pretty good, but a bit hefty on the "RNG" side of things. I'll probably not end up picking it up, but wouldn't balk at friends bringing it... I just have too many other wargames that I would rather play if I have 2 people.

I love the fluff incorporated in the game. Really would love to see the 4 player game pan out.

RATING: 9
Components: YES on the 2nd print run, FAIL on the first. The term "tiles" is a LIE. They are hexagonal CARDS. The clix miniatures and mechanic work great in the game! Cards are plastic but could easily become worn.

Gameplay: YES, clix are great, overall gameplay could be even better (see below)

Exploration: YES

Combat: Mehhh YES

Missions: Mehhh

Development: FAIL. Apart from assigning crew members there is no long term thinking here,only long term tactical strategies. Building defenses for example, could be a nice touch for longer games.

Cards: YES!

Game Setup: YES! excellent mechanics in the game setup, except from the spaceship "drafting", which is actually random.

Theme: Sure.

Outstanding game, dripping with Star Trek theme. There is definitely luck invloved in the system test die rolls as well as missions you get and then missions you have active, as well as cards you draw from your deck, but the luck is pretty well offset with strategy.

This feels like a real Star Trek game, better than the disappointing Star Trek: Ascendancy (still a good game but with a couple of flawed mechanics). A pity that the cardboard component budget had to be so low, because of the Clix minis so to keep it at a price they could sell enough of them, as that is the only downside to the game (apart from the small clix dials that is a strain for us with older eyes).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Consider Star Trek: Frontiers, Star Trek: Ascendancy or investing in a Star Trek: Attack Wing collection instead.  Not terrible, but obsolete.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Even if you don't like Star Trek, there's something in here for you.  It's got tactics, story, options and good old in your face combat.  The miniatures are pretty average (same as in Attack Wing) and the quality of the other components is a bit of a let down too.

In fact the quality of the components is the only thing that stops this one being a 10 really.  Other than that, great fun, and it's fairly quick to play as well.

To solve the component issue, use premium thick sleeves on all the cards, make a card box (cut out the insert(s) to suit) and laminate the location deck tiles.

If you can get past: 1) The way the clunky rules are written (most everything is in the rule book-you just gotta turn over rocks to piece everything together), and, 2) The problems some people have with the miniatures and the tile cards... If you can deal with those two issues, then the GAME is an ABSOLUTE BLAST! The game play, the theme, and the game mechaincs shine. They shine so much that this game is getting a 10 from me, where otherwise the two issues I mentioned would lower the score. And did I mention that it's fun?

The game where you play out a season of Star Trek, rather than a particular show or battle. Quite fun, although a bit random: several games have been decided by the victory points from randomly-rolled encounters. But even there, the lion's share of victory points are earned the old-fashioned way: exploring strange new worlds, influencing new cultures, and blowing things up.

Some of the components are problematic (ships not 'clix'-ing right, thin cards, tiny chits, etc.) but the game is pretty fun. The missions are really what kind of drives the gameplay. I liked how you get to build your command deck and am interested to see the different things I can come up with there in future games. Decent game I'm afraid it won't hit the table too often but it'll be cool when it does.

This is basically an "adventure RPG" board game, similar to Tales of the Arabian Nights or Middle-Earth Quest, but with a Star Trek theme. If you are/were a fan of the show, you will have lots of fun exploring planets and stars, finding yourself trapped in time loops and black holes, and encountering Ferengi merchants and all of the other familiar faces from the show. If, however, you are like me and have never watched Star Trek, or you don't understand or care about its universe, then the game can be frustrating. As long as you let go of winning and just try to enjoy the theme it is actually a very fun game. If you care about being able to predict the game events or control what happens to your ships, you will hate how random and arbitrary it can be.

UPDATE: Since I last made my review, I have watched all Star Trek series and movies. Twice. I love this game.

It's OK.  I don't find the gameplay exciting but it works.  It's weird mixing generations together but I can see why they did it (to appeal to as many people as possible).  Wizkids' clicky bases are not a good choice for this game because you adjust them frequently and a "click" has no meaning.

Fleet Captains is, in short, Star Trek in a box. The ship minis are pretty nice, the cards are thematic, the faction mission distribution is thematic, and it is just an overall fun game.

A tonne of components, but a surprisingly accessible ruleset. I'm amazed at how much Star Trek they were able to cram into this box!

 9 is based on one play with 2 players.  We didn't see nearly all the encounter deck and didn't cycle through many cards.  A look through the decks to see what's there would be handy.

On the third play, we tried with 12 points but it seemed a little long.  Klingon victory for the first time :D

4th play was a shorter 8 point game.

5th play was 3 players: 2 Feds vs. the Klingons.  Klingons managed 11 of the 16 points before the Feds won.

Awesome game. Very thematic. The components aren't the greatest. The clix ships are pretty good. A little dry brushing and a wash will do wanders for the models. The card stock on the tiles is very thin, and the cards themselves are too thin as well., the tokens are functional but rather bland regarding the artwork, but the overall experience is what makes this game shine. The missions that are custom to the type of ships in your fleet keep each play through feeling different than the last. The rules aren't too complicated, and fairly intuitive. Overall, this is a very good game once you overlook the poor quality of some of the components. Mini expansions with more federation ships would be nice, Truly a very "Trekkie" experience, the game actually feels like several episodes between the missions and the various encounters.

This may not be the best gave ever, and it has horrible "tiles," but it is definitely fun to play.  The reason I can't go higher, is that sometimes, your ship is left without any very meaningful actions to take, and there is so much luck in the game.

Update: There is too much luck in the game, and sometimes the missions are either impossible or boring.

I've played this a few times, and I like the game but I do have a problem with it.  I have never seen the Klingons win.  They have a focus around combat and almost require it to get their points, but they aren't really better at combat than the federation and it really feels like an uphill battle.  Still the pieces are great and there's a wonderful exploration feel to the game.  There are one or 2 objectives that are a little too strong however.

RATING: 8
I am such a Trekkie, that I have as much fun reading the cards as trying to overpower the Klingons.  I find myself quoting Star Trek quite a bit as I play.  I won 2 out of the first 3 games I played.  Tough game, but fun.

RATING: 7.5
Decent game but good lord, people are not kidding when they say components in here are flimsy.  The cards and hex tiles are basically paper with a linen finish.  And I have never seen such cheesy dice in a game before.  Reminds me of a prize you get in a cereal box or out of a candy machine.  But one thing I do disagree with is complaints about the rulebook.  I think it's fine.  Everything makes complete sense and is pretty well written.  The only thing I could see is that, to me, it's kind of laid out like almost like a magazine.  But no problems whatsoever understanding it.  Game play is good and I'd say, overall, a very entertaining game.  Use your own dice.

RATING: 7
It succeeds at what it sets out to be. It feels like you're playing a Star Trek game and not a game that happens to have Star Trek pieces. The rule book is not organized very well and finding certain bits of info can be tricky. Strongly recommend leaning from somebody that already knows the game. Really not that difficult once you've played a couple of rounds. It flows nicely and makes sense.

The clix dials are only marginally better than useless and I suggest ignoring them completely. Use the cards instead.

Finally, dear Lord, be careful with the ship models as they do like to snap right off.

RATING: 6
Been looking forward to this for a while. Little disappointed though. Card stock far too thin and models not glued together very well. I was also missing the two player starting location pieces though you don't really need them. 
Game play isn't bad but took a couple games just to understand the rules correctly as rulebook is not very well written.
Really needs expansions to add new ships, other races (Romulan, Cardassian and Dominion) otherwise this game will get stale quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Components are "OK" the cardstock is not as good as expected. The ships are nice and gameplay is easy but I miss a little bit of everything. There should be some risk und danger when visiting planets, the ship battles could also be more fun I wish they had more detail (which weapon to fire and which shilds I power up like SFB). The encounters are the biggest surprise in every game. These tell the story.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The components are a mixed bag. The clix idea is nice and the images and thematic text on the cards and hexes are great. But, the overall quality of the materials used is really lacking - especially the hex tiles (minor imperfections ruin the uniformity needed to keep the identity of the hexes hidden). You can sleeve the cards but the hexes are another matter.

This game also isn't necessarily balanced - but who cares. With Fleet Captains, it's all about theme and this game has theme in spades. I enjoy this game just for the experience of it.

RATING: 8
The game is a lot of fun and if you are a Trek fan then this may be right up your alley. Don't let the name of the game fool you this is not a Star Trek Wargame. There is combat, but it is also balanced with exploration and the completion of missions in order to earn victory points.

The components are a mixed bag. The ships are really cool, but strangely unpainted. I can not think of another WizKids Clix game that has unpainted miniatures, so that is a minus in my book. Also, the plastic used for the models is very brittle, so be careful. Dropping a ship on a hard surface will most likely break something. Keep the box insert for the ships, as it is the best way to protect them. I find the safest way to remove the ships from the insert is to grasp them by the disk when pulling them off.

The Clix dials are hard to turn on some of the ships, so again be careful when trying to turn them or you may end up snapping a piece off.

The counters used to mark things like victory points, cloaked ships, etc come punched and are nice and thick. 

The tiles used for the various star systems you explore are really thin and flimsy. Watch out when shuffling them I have already damaged some of them after only a couple of plays. The cards used in the game also use a very cheap, thin stock. Finally, the cheap little dice that come in the game are a joke.

The game is a lot of fun and I am glad I got it. I would have rated it a couple of points higher if it were not for the crappy components.

RATING: 10
Love it. It has reignited my love for Star Trek, but besides that, this games has everything I love in a competitive adventure game. The mission-driven victory point system is really at the heart of this game for me, I love this mechanic in games. Combined with that is the right amount of randomness in the encounters, and the location tiles, with the ability to respond and mitigate by customizing your command card deck at the beginnning of the game is perfect. Great ships and the crew cards you assign to them really get you attached to the importance of each and every ship in your fleet. The amount of player interaction is perfect as it is driven by the combat mission cards primarily. That makes each attack you make mean something more.

I can't get enough of this one, and it's certainly earned a new place in my top ten favorite games.

RATING: 7
Bad: Component quality is bad, as in, many of the ships break, or their bases don't work.  Also, pretty Ameritrash-y with the dice rolls, random explorations, card effects, etc.

Good: The fact that you choose how big to make the "board" and what the VP goal is means you can tailor a game to what you want at the moment. Games usually last 1 hour or less, but if you play with all the ships for multiple hours you can.

Verdict: I'm biased because of the theme, and without it I probably wouldn't like this game that much.  There are also balance issues with cards (and the two biggest ships).  But I always have fun playing it, so that means a 7.

RATING: 5
Rating after a couple plays. Meh, it's ok. I like the clicker stands to indicate settings and damage. Unfortunately, the game is overly complex for what IMO amounts to a mission-based Twilight Imperium III without a construction phase and the fun removed.

As the Klingons you want to focus on combat, but to get into combat you have to move quickly. That's all well and good, right up to the point where you run into black holes, quasars and encounters that damage your ships before you ever get a chance to even get into combat. And by then the Federation has explored or scanned enough to win the game. Boring.

In short, the tile placement is just too chaotic. Starting with a habitable planet next to your starting area can be the difference between victory and defeat. Which means that winning or losing the game depends too much on factors outside of your control. Dumb.

I found the game itself a bit fiddly and long, too, and there were definitely some rules questions.

Sorry folks, but this game is highly overrated.

This is one of the few games with this much direct aggression that plays 3p (with the expansion) that I actually like.  Much like Dune, the theme helps allay my concerns about having to wade through the politics of "don't attack me, attack him".  And the hero-clicks base is used pretty well here (though the information is necessarily repeated on cards).  Heavy heavy doses of luck, though, which was brought home when in my first game I couldn't get out of my home planet without taking at least one damage.  All the worst cards in the game came up there, and I got destroyed.  But I would play again anyway.

Bad quality components but the game itself is ok, plays fast and is easy to understand. Had I been a Trekkie I would probably have enjoyed it more as I would have recognized the characters and incidents on the cards. Now they mostly just looked cheesy. Not too fond of some of the super weird missions and encounter cards either but most of them works.

I like the deck building aspect, choose your deck after which ships you draw. Nice touch. The ship models where you can choose how to divide the energy between weapons/engine/sensors/shields are cool as well, especially if painted I guess.

Players play either the Federation or Klingons in the Star Trek universe.  The goal of the game is to earn victory points by surviving chance encounters, destroying opposing ships, or completing mission objectives.  Each turn you get to move your ships, explore space and take actions.  Actions include attacking, influencing, repairing and so on.  First past the victory point threshold wins.  Large, lavish game with great miniatures, thin/sticky cards, and a mixed bag of counters and hex tiles.  Thematically, Trek fans will be in hog heaven.  The game however is a Nexus Ops spin off, with a ton of chaos added, and a rulebook three times as long.  The end result just felt messy to me.

First impressions after one play.

Love the concept, love the models, although the Klingon ships are all too similar.  

I definitely see the reasons for the "DungeonQuest in space" comparisons I have read.

I did not seem to me that all the mechanisms of this game hang together well.  The Clix element is an interesting idea for handling power allocation, but I found it to be very fiddly in practice.  It is obvious that the Clix models were shoehorned into the design.

Thee challenges seemed often very lopsided.  Either you had no chance, or you crushed it.  Which side of that you ended up on was often chance.  Also, some of the missions are trivially easy, while some are pretty much impossible, and this is not entirely balanced by the VP payout.

Other miscellaneous complaints:
* Clocking is just a big pain to track. 
* A tied roll in some types of tests is a success, and in others it is a failure. That really couldn't have been harmonized?
* Disappointing ship models.  The biggest usability problem for me is that, while the Federation ships are nicely distinctive, and Klingon ships are hard to tell apart.  More argument for why they should have been painted!  The Clix bases are big pain.

My overall impression so far is that the concept is excellent, but the game mechanisms are largely half-baked.  The game is a mess of stuff thrown together to give a "complete" Star Trek experience, but the execution is lacking.  I'd play this again, but I'm not too excited about it.

Great game, not so great components.  Too much mission diversity in terms of challenge/reward, where one easy mission gives 2 or 3 vps, while a harder one can give 1.

All the money went to the nice fleet miniatures - all the other components are crap, even for a much cheaper game. Flimsy cards, paper-thin hexes, clix that don't click, tons of small, largely undistinguishable counters and the two smallest dice you're ever going to find. 

All this would be irrelevant if the game was good. And it might be, for some people. But I pretty much hated it. Turns take forever and are subject to the whims of numerous subsequent random elements. In my game, the three hexes closest to my command post were a black hole, a subspace rift and a nebula. While the Klingons were flinging around the board, cloaked and gaining points, I got to move, take damage, and spend my next turn moving back to get repaired. On turn 3, it was like turn 1 all over again for me... in what turned out to be a 5 turn game. FUN!

Pros: Card drafting\deck-building element of the game.
      Klingon ships look really cool.

Cons: Everything else, really.

Add 2 to this rating if you dice and miniatures-type rulesets. Add another 2 or 3 if you like Star Trek - I don't particularly although I don't dislike it too much either. 

Playing this when I could've played Reef Encounter or Age of Empires III was a bad, bad choice.

Really enjoyed this.  There is a bit of a learning curve (in terms of the different actions you can perform as part of your turn).  As others have mentioned, the components aren't the best.  The hexes are flimsy and the two dice that came with the game made me laugh when I took them out of the box.  I really liked the miniatures and the clix system fits well.  The best part is how star treky this feels.  Everything ties well into the show.  The Federation acts like the Federation.  The Kingons act like the Kingons.  The random encounters are fun.  The designers did a good job of incorporating all of the different series into one game.  Next time we are going to play with more VPs because it seemed like the game ended right when it was getting good.

The game play is fun, but the components are pretty poor when you consider the cost. Biggest gripes for me are the tiles and the starship models:

1.) The thin cardboard tiles may be easily torn/bent. It's inevitable. 
2.) My copy included several ships which were broken, had numerous misaligned parts, or coated with gobs of glue. It really broke my heart when I opened the box.

Maybe these items will be properly addressed in a 2nd edition.

Great game! Especially if you like Star Trek ... and who doesn't?

Setup and preparation can take some time, but the game itself plays rather fast. It's very chaotic, so you need to improvise more than to plan a few turns ahead. Turns can take a few minutes though. The game can be a bittle fiddly, so I recommend to toss the insert and use another storing solution to minimize setup time.

Another thing to consider is that because there are so many different cards and effects, chances are that you will encounter (get it?) situations where how the rules play out may be a bit vague.

Rating is for the poor quality of the components and content (not game play) and the big disappointment after I opened my box:

The ships, in really thin plastic, is the worst quality I have ever seen from WizKids and I was a fan of the clix from the beginning.
With first MageKnight figures till the end, Dungeons, Mechwarrior, HeroClix, Horrorclix, CrimsonSkies..., and I still own over 6000 figures,
but this is cheapest standard! 

The same with the really thin card, which you have to immediately pack in card sleeves otherwise they will be damaged after one or two plays...
No publisher in 2011 should be able to sell such a product!

Unfortunately I have to remove all following WizKids products, like the MageKnight Boardgame, from my wishlist... Seems some publisher learning only by loosing money...

Played 1 time with 2 players for 3.25 hours.

AUG 2013: Well...hmmm. My first two turns were a lot of fun. And then my friend and I began to get bogged down in the rulebook. And the more we read the rulebook, the more bogged down we felt. Seriously - I believe this to be the worst rulebook I've read so far in my life.

However! I see a lot of promise in this game. I think it does a great job of capturing the Star Trek narrative (eve for a casual Trek fan like myself), and the gameplay was quite enjoyable. I'm a fan, and could see this going up to a 9 for me.

Just lost a game when The Traveller scooped a Federation ship out of the hex I'd pinned them to with two Birds of prey as they landed on an unexplored hex fulfilling a 3VP Mission Card they had just cycled to.  SO. MUCH. FUN.

2013AUG30 - Rate 8 - This game was brutally unfun. Bad die rolls for me, and I had an awful deck. The key in this game is to make sure that your deck works for your strategy, or you hold fistfulls of uselessness.

An instant favorite. This game captures the feel of Star Trek very well. I get to explore the galaxy, engage in starship combat, decide whether it's best to be cautious or just charge ahead and get stuck in black holes, even have my ship rip through the very fabric of space and time and emerge as another ship! The basic mechanics are quite simple, but there is seemingly endless variation from deck building, random card draws, dice rolling, and of course an opponent who has also built a deck, is drawing cards randomly, etc. Every turn something crazy can happen, and though you must always be prepared for the unexpected, you also always feel equipped to handle whatever the game or your opponent throws at you. And instead of making it a hodgepodge, this randomness really gives the game that overall Star Trek adventurous exploration of the unknown flavor. Plus, there is no runaway victory; everything is well balanced and feels solidly devised and tested. Most important, of course, is that it's loads of fun.

Thematic, strategic, tactical, beautiful. My negatives don't match what I have read: I agree that the cards are thin, but they shuffle well. The finish on them is superb,and having tiles that can easily shuffle is so very satisfying.

Negatives: 
chits: hard to sort out system modifiers and no attention given in an otherwise superbly designed box for storing the chits. (also the dice provided with the game are insultingly terrible)

The Klingons are not intuitive to play. So far, the game seems balanced towards the Federation.

The Star Trek adventure game that I've been waiting for! A little bit fiddly, then again I've only played this once. Really brings the Trek theme to the table. The encounter and mission decks plus the various combinations of Fed/Klingon subdecks give this a lot of replayability. The minis are a fragile and the scale of the ships is out of whack. The thin cards and location tiles didn't bother me as much as I thought they would. I could see them wearing down easily though.

FC is a very thematic game based on a world that I have grown up with and is still very close to me. The game really does bring the flavour of Star Trek. However, it felt at times too much like a Choose Your Own Adventure book, with a lot of narrative and little real choices to make. There are quite a few 'gamey' things about it as well which don't make it feel totally engaging. I felt a little too random as well, where by the drawing of the right Mission Cards, you can either win it or lose it. Perhaps with more plays one would feel more like taking on some of the more complex actions and that would bring up the competition. Its odd that the game could be played largely without a number of the major components. Hmmm... Oh well; top marks for the 3D ships!

Really like everything about this game except the click action bases for the starships. Some of them just do not want to rotate, and I get very frustrated to the point of deducting 1 point from my review.  I sleeve the cards, so I can live with the production value of those.

For Star Trek fans, this game (after 2 plays) seems to have high replay value.  Looking forward to future expansions with DS9, other alien races, and more ships

Impulse buy from the clearance shelf at my FLGS.  I like thematic games.  I like Star Trek.  I handed over my wallet.  A fairly simple skill based system with great graphics, though I wish the cards were of better quality.  Particularly love the exploration aspect of the game.  I might have enjoy this game most as a solo/cooperative variant (offered here on BGG), but I found that it was more exciting against an opponent.

If you are a Star Trek fan, this is probably the game that will enable you to geek out the hardest.

RATING: 4
Poor components and inbalanced game play harm what could have been a fantastic Trek game. I will revisit rating after another 10 games but at this time I feel ripped off and misguided by fanboys who fail to accept the game has serious problems both with components and balance.

Feds = Science missions (Boring) and avoid Klingons
Klingons = Rush accross the board not scanning (lets hope you dont hit a black hole) and attack Feds at every possible opportunity if they haven't won already.

Map layout can decide who wins or loses, a few bad tiles as Klingons and your stuffed.

Some missions are simply ridiculous as well.

RATING: 7
Just one play in... does a spectacular job of catching the theme of Star Trek (esp. the whole "all power to the sensors" moves you can make & the plethora of encounters). Caveat: it's gonna be a little fiddly for the first play or two until everyone can wrap their brains around the system - then, watch out! I think it'll play quickly, cleanly & w/lots of fun in the rather pricey box.

RATING: N/A
Lots of things I like about this game: the ship models, the way the gameboard is generated, the character cards, etc. But for me, the game is somewhat undone by two aspects: First, exploration is limited by simply turning over a card. I would have hoped there was more of a story that unfolded. And second, the game is strictly about conflict between the factions. It's really about the Federation vs. Klingons, or with the expansion, the Federation vs. the Romulans. Or with a fan-made expansion, the Federation vs. the Borg. Combat is way too important. But many, many Star Trek stories are about different types of conflict that don't involve combat. So the game's approach is very limited and doesn't get at the core of the Federation's reason for existing: exploring the final frontier. That's there ... but it's not the real core of the game. The core of the game is combat. Plus, the game simply scares the bejesus out of my family. My wife or daughter always want to be the Federation. So then I play the Klingons. When they see the Klingon ships slowly closing in on their position, they freak out and quit!

The only thing dragging down this game is an atrocious rulebook. Almost the worst of any game in my collection. Players need constantly to refer to it, and it slows the game down.

In this space exploration game, the players play Federation against the Klingons. The players try to fulfill different missions which give points. While space combat is an important part of the game, there is much more the players can do to get points. To aid in your cause, you construct decks with events and characters that can be played and choosing the right decks is the main strategic decision in the game. I do not mean that the game plays itself, but the rest of the decisions are mostly tactical.

I only played in a four player game. With that you are more at the mercy with the missions you get as each team share the same mission deck, but their ships might be more focused on one area or another. Building your decks seems to be more strategic in a two-player game, but the nice team experience is hard to neglect.

This is what I would call an experience game. The game itself doesn’t have anything that feels new and fresh, but the feeling you get when you play it and the flavor of the cards is enough to sell me.

Nothing about this game should work. It feels like the rules were established by a sick baby trying to reconstruct Runebound in her head. The rule book is horrendous. The components are way under par--the cards and tiles can actually rend your hands with thin little paper cuts. Make no mistake, you will open this box, read the rules, and just sort of physically deflate. 

Yet this game is somehow (by accident?) fun. Memorable stuff just happens in this game, and you will constantly peer over the game board, trying to determine if your opponent needs one or two more points to win the game. Helps if you like the franchise.

I usually see licensed games, and assume it will be crap, as publishers seem to rely on the license to sell the product.  With that in mind, I was very pleasantly surprised with this game.  It is not your typical mass market crap.  

The game seems to be themed everywhere from the original series up to just before the 2010 or 2009 relaunch.  I have not really followed most of the ST universe beyond the original series and the first few movies.  However, even with the new and old material all mixed together, I never really felt distracted.  Neither, did I feel that the game required I know the universe to enjoy the game.  

We played standard 2player set ups with a 10pt fleet.  It sounds small, but made for a fast moving and satisfying game each time.  After the first game, play really sped up for us as actions are many, but simple to implement.  

The game focuses on exploration, with encounters and some combat.  Actually the mission decks for each race are well tailored to how they behaved in their respective shows/movies.  Klingons have more combat oriented missions than the Feds who might have more exploration, settling, etc. type missions.  Victory points are scored for completing missions, blowing up enemy ships, and building starbases.  Most will come from the missions.  

I liked how combat was handled.  It is part, but not the crux of the game.  Even if you lose a ship, you need only spend an action next turn to deploy a new ship (with an increase in fleet size!).    I don't think a player can really ever be knocked out, as this is not a conquest game.  

Each player also has a command deck which can aid you in combat or in completing other missions.  There are even familiar crew who can board your ships to boost your ships' abilities.  You only choose 40 command cards each game, so can have different deck compositions each game to further extend replayability.  

I haven't even talked about the bits.  The ship sculpts on the miniatures are wonderfully done.  The art is all either directly from or inspired by the shows and the ship displays.

I'd have liked card board for the tiles, but the tiles are still a very nice card material.  Using the cards, I assume also allowed them to include many more locations.  I see that as increasing replay variability and an overall positive.

I'm ready to play this again, and looking forward to picking up a copy.  I hope and expect there will be a Romulan expansion in the works.

RATING: 6
Good game that captures the feel of the theme. The cards and tiles have nice design and artwork, but are horribly thin. I have heard about broken miniatures and hard-to-operate clix bases, but my set is nice. The victory point system often stops the game at odd times, in the middle of a major battle for example. This mechanic makes a game feel unfinished. 
The lopsided balance is my biggest complaint: the Federation can huddle at their own end of the board and gain a good victory point lead while the Klingons try to traverse the tiles to make contact. If I discover house rules that help to restore game balance, my rating should increase.

The components make the theme shine in this one.  Although I think the clix system actually inhibits this game a little (I would have been fine with tokens on summary cards), the models are incredible.  This game captures the Star Trek theme well.  It has it all: exploring, fighting, tribbles, and Orion Slave Women.  You'll be quoting Star Trekisms all night long!

RATING: 4
This is clearly a thematic game without much concern for strategy or balance. But even so, it irks me by mixing different eras and crews in the "Star Trek" universe. I wish they had at least taken some care with the pictures in each of the various command sub-decks, but images from the original series, for example, are spread across all of them. There is even a card in Capt. Picard's sub-deck that shows Lt. Uhura!

It's definitely cool to play with those miniature starships from the various series and movies, at least if you play the Federation (less so with the Klingons, I imagine). Each Federation ship model is unique, but there are some duplicates in the Klingon fleet. Of course, they come with the annoying and unnecessary "clix" bases that Wizkids shoehorn into every game they publish and only serve to increase the cost. This time, fortunately, there are also reference cards with all the relevant data, emphasizing how useless the bases are.

The game is needlessly complex and awfully luck-driven, but I got some enjoyment from the thematic experience, as I'm a big "Star Trek" fan - which probably means my rating is a little generous.

Wow.  This game has hit the nail on the head for me.  It has the right balance between randomness and strategy, handles both strategic and tactical situations equally well, and tells a heck of a story.  I bought 2 copies, one had the production problems you've heard about (cards loose, one broken ship), the newer one was fine when I opened it (having the card overlay and foam on the ships minis).  At first I wanted thicker space tiles, but after playing I think I like the thinner ones, as it makes it easier to shuffle and keeps storage space down.

The randomness can be a big let down for some people, so be aware of it before playing.  However, for me, managing the randomness in the game (and in life!) is what makes it worth playing.

I even made a tactical minis game from the components, check out the forums for the rules.

Fantastic game, and a very rare 10 rating from me.

The energy management system (ie. cliks) works well and keeps the game simple.  The models are nice and detailed.

The cards are very thin, which is Ok as you can sleeve them, but the System location hexes are the same thinkness, which is very sad, as they skimed on the wrong components.

Gameplay is OK, although the Klingons have to be agressive.  You may want to move, then adjust your energy level if need be.  Scanning is nice, if it's an objective.

Only played one game, with 4 players, and it was a little long, but this is due to inexperience.  Will definitely be trying this one again.

Edit: Tried a 3-player game with the Romulan expansion, and we all liked it.

There is one nonsensical rule about winning the game, which disadvantages the first player.  If he scores 10 points, then all the other players need to do is match his score to steal the win.  You got to be kidding!?  Needless to say, we have stricken out this rule.

I am a gigantic Star Trek fan, and this game certainly tries to capture as much of that feel as possible.  However, I find the game to be a bit of a mess. Aside from the fragile miniatures and poor components, the rules took many, many extra reads in order to play the first time.  It's been a few months since I last played, and I suspect I'd have to spend a good while again with my nose in the rulebook. 

That said, I do enjoy the Star Trek experience the game provides.  If not for that, I wouldn't return to this game at all.

This game reminds me a lot of nexus ops with how you actually win. It was chaotic and mildly fun, but I beat my opponent silly.  I'd like to say I was just awesome, but I think I got quite lucky on my mission draw.

The game seems a bit simplistic in terms of tactical ship combat, but I only played once. I don't think the click part of the game is useful, it would be better to say you have W/X/Y/Z power to distribute amongst the systems depending on your damage level and just let people set whatever they want.  The clicking seemed to actually hinder play a little.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A free form Star Trek game, with the selling point of attractive miniatures. The Clix bases really are a solution looking for a problem, the ships are large enough to overhang the window in the base and the font used is far too small. Drawing ships at random is a success determinant as a few big ships are much more powerful than a lot of little ones. You also need to quickly recycle your mission cards as difficulty and reward are by no means equal. I'm very much a Trekkie, but found this rather bland, a real shame as a little more structure in the game could have made this a winner.

Want to play through a season of Star Trek? This is your game. Sure, you get completely screwed sometime. That's part of the ST universe. Go in with the view you're creating the plotlines for a few episodes, though, and you'll end up having a lot of fun.

Also, more balanced that most would have you believe. You need to play each faction differently, but they can all win at a pretty equal rate.

Enough about the components, though.  The game itself is AMAZING!  So much fun, and a must-have for any self-respecting Trekkie.  Nothing captures the feeling of Star Trek like this!  Probably my favourite board game right now.

RATING: 7.4
Not quite the space exploration experience I was hoping it would be. Though it's true this is the closest board game experience you can have to actually experience a Star Trek episode, it's still not close enough for me. 

Star Trek: Fleet Captains is, at heart, a simplified tactical minis game. the game is about combat, and although the use of the Clix figures is innovative and thematic, it boils all the intricacies of being the captain of a Star Fleet ship in conflict (should I raise shields? Load torpedos? Increase power to engines? Lower shields to beam down an away team?) down to one decision--what Clix setting should I use this turn? 

Exploration is also similarly abstracted--essentially every encounter (which are only drawn about 50% of time and only when landing on unexplored hexes at the beginning of the game) and many missions just amount to die-roll tests ("I need to scan this nebula--so I've got to roll an 18 for a sensors check"). There's not much engagement with narrative, or complex choices to make about how to handle alien encounters (which to me was really the heart of what Star Trek is about). Star Trek: Expeditions has much the same problem, though it trades narrative depth for shallowness in intergalactic  exploration and general variety. At least Fleet Captains has scads of cool spaceship minis to play with...

Anyway, once I subtract my own expectations and desires from the game itself, I have to admit it's fairly fun for what it is, and it is satisfying to coordinate the galactic conflict between the Federation and the Klingons--jockeying for desirable planets, trying to complete missions, cloaking, diverting all power to shields--er, I mean clicking the Clix base--but I still find myself wishing I could boldly go in search of new life forms, wrestle with the Prime Directive, investigate space-time anomalies, and in short, spin out story after story like I was living through a season of Trek. I can't say I have a strong idea what that might look like wrought in cardboard (Descent 2.0 in space perhaps?), but I'll know it when I see it, and sadly, ST:FC falls just short for me.

This game definitely captures the feel of being in a few star trek episodes.  The rules are not the easiest thing to comprehend, but it's worth it.  Best played with just 2 people, even with the romulan expansion.

A giant box of broken spaceships, broken rules, nasty cardboard components and unacceptably cheap card stock. I don't even like Star Trek. Incredibly, my eldest son and I LOVE this game. It's like Arkham Horror in space that plays in a fraction of the time. Requires a lot of DIY to make it serviceable though.

OWNED SINCE 2013
This game is great. I was very hesitate to buy this at first, due to the poor quality I kept reading about, but I am glad I finally got it. I bought my set in June of 2012, and the components are fine. Sure some of the clix are harder to move then others, but I can live with it. Yes, the card quality is WizKids, so not so good, but I will sleeve them and problem solved. The tiles/ board will need to be laminated, because I don't see it lasting too long otherwise. I also wish the game came with more tiles, or at least the expansion has some, but the game works fine as is. My kids 9 and 11 years of age can play this game. They have no troubles and generally understand the strategies needed to win. My wife, not a Star Trek fan, also likes this game. Is is not combat driven, and at the end of the game you wish it was a little longer because you did not get a chance to do everything you wanted to. Highly recommended to anyone, a must for a Star Trek fan. I think it is the best Star Trek game yet, and I don't see one capturing the theme any better. The "War of the Rings" for Star Trek.

RATING: 7
I'm not a big fan of games that use minatures.  However, I really enjoy this game.  I am a big Star Trek fan so that probably makes me lean in favour of the game to begin with.  I've played it four times now and two games were close, one was a blow out and one within three points.  Two games saw a great deal of ship to ship combat and one game had basically none. One game had several encounter cards activated and two saw almost none.  All games lasted under an hour and a half.  Although I would have preferred heavy cardboard stock location cards, I can certaintly live with the components as they are.  I personally don't see what all the hoopla is regarding the components.  The box insert is incredible for storing the mini's and thank goodness for the cheat sheet that shows you were each ship goes.  Although I was fortunate to receive my copy with no broken ships, I certaintly wouldn't have been surprised to see a couple broken due to shipping.

RATING: 6.5
Good game with good mechanics but there is something that it makes me not wanting to play the game as often as I should. The truth of the game is that this IS Star Trek, for real: the missions, the exploration, the characters, the races abilities, how to play each race, the things that you are allowed to do, are as if you were on the series. There are many wonderful things about this game: the ships are amazing, the box is well prepared for fitting every model, exploring a new location, configuring your cards deck... amazing. So, then, why that rating? The fact is that it has many amazing mechanics, for instance the combat and how the ships change to yellow or red alert is very well done, but, in my experience, the game is boring. I don't now if it has to do with the players I had played with, but it has felt like hours to be waiting for the turn to come back. This factor is even worse if you play the cooperative version with 2 players per faction, and if you add the romulan expansion, trust me, I have been waiting 30 minutes for the turn to come back, that is not acceptable, and I understand that this has to do more with the other players than with the game, but I think that the game doesn't really help with that. Another issue that I see, is that combate is not encourage, exploration is encouraged, once you get to the late game phases and you are able to claim one yellow objective after another, it becomes a bit crazy.
Positive:
1. This IS Star Trek. Highly thematic
2. There are some great mechanics that match perfectly the theme
3. The models are amazing
4. The ships damage mechanics work very well
Negative:
1. 75 minutes of play... please, do not make me laugh!! think more about 180
2. Cards and tiles are not very good quality. Are very thin
3. The different ways to victory are not well-balanced. Exploration is more encouraged than combat

RATING: 7.5
I'm a Star Trek fan, but the first games weren't a blast in contrast to the statements of many claiming the game would be a 'dream come true' for every trekkie.

Still, the game is good.  But beware: it's quite random, not full of strategy/tough decisions and taking you wherever it pleases, not neccessarily where you would want to be.  If you loathe such features, just _avoid_ the game.  I usually do, but not in this case - I like the theme and the game is finished quickly (just over 2h with some experience) so that I can tolerate the fact the game is more about fun/narrative than long-term optimization and a true battle of minds.

To make the game longer you can always set more VPs as a winning condition.  This flexibility is great btw.

I'm not yet ready to give the game an '8', but quite close.  I just need to feel more of an atmosphere and exploit _smoothly_ and _effectively_ all possibilities offered by the game (close to that).
The problem is that the lengthy rules, plenty of options and active abilities might overwhelm the players in first games or at least cause them to focus on the rules/possibilities rather than on the flow of the game itself, planning ahead and the theme/story that unfolds before their eyes.  This way some tension is lost :(
I hope the problem passes for good with more games under the belt.

--

Complaints:

- quality of components is doubtful, BUT the real pain in the a$# are those damned clix discs.  They rotate very stiffly (easy to damage the plastic ships) and instead of easing the gameplay they make it a hard struggle with components (additional effect: increased playing time).  That's a scandal for such a price... :-///

- ruleset is horrible.  Rules are badly edited, inprecise in many places, worded doubtfully and there is a lot of gaps in them.  Even the most basic rules (like fulfiling missions, end of the game etc.) are unclear.  There are tons of questions here, on bgg (I recommend to read the appropriate threads) and looong FAQ already...  Heroclix should send the guy responsible for rules editing back to the Monopoly rules writing again.  Really - the ruleset looks like it was created by a person editing the rules solely for hipermarket games so far... :-///

RATING: 8
The closest you'll ever come to sending your own fleet of starships to explore a region of space. This game genuinely feels like you're playing through a series of Star Trek! DS9, of course. Y'know, with continuity and consequences and other things the other series liked to ignore. I will always love this game.

Positives: The miniatures are to die for! I've never seen such detail in board game miniatures! Location, encounter and command cards have beautiful pictures and are fixed in Star Trek canon. The core mechanics are simple and cover most of the situations you come across. Anything they can do in Star Trek you can do in this game.

Negatives: So many tokens, and most of them unnecessary. Location cards are very flimsy and hard to pick up, which makes exploration frustratingly fiddly. House rulings sometimes required as the rule book skims over some specifics and the online FAQ does little to clarify things. Klingon command cards have quite a lot of repetition.

Fleet Captains is oozing with theme and conceptually brilliant. The blending of mechanics here is a major strength. The ships, command cards, encounters, and missions all work together very well. You truly feel like you are commanding a fleet. Lots of fun to be had here and isn't just for Trekkies. Yes, the actual gameplay is quite random (card draw, exploration, die rolls for encounters, combat, tests, etc.), which I normally don't like, but the game is just so much fun. I'm a euro guy through and through, but this is one of my Ameritrash guilty pleasures.

Totally bought this on a whim after my wife and I got our tax return; she bought shoes. 

Narratively driven, wonderfully immersive, and intuitively designed, Fleet Captains truly is Star Trek in a box. The game offers strategy (mission cards), tactics (unpredictable exploration, encounter, and rival factions), and a good dose of luck mixed in making for a remarkably high replay value. 

If you are a Star Trek fan I can think of no better game recommendation for you.

RATING: 7
This is one of these games which is sort of all over the place in mission statement and rules, with components that somehow seem both sumptuous and chintzy at the same time.  The game play can be incredibly random due to the high variance in rewards from locations and encounters.  And yet, for all this, it can be quite a bit of fun to play if you get into the spirit of things - a big part of this is without a doubt the limited number of actions and rapid pace of the turns, which normally go by very quickly and keep the players involved.

RATING: 7
While I like a lot of what's going on here, Star Trek: Fleet Captains is more than a bit messy. The rules are alright (though they are laid out poorly and exhibit a riot of fonts), but there are so many interactions--command cards, location tiles, encounter cards, mission cards, dice results--that some weird edge cases are likely to arise that are not explicitly covered by the rules. (The official FAQ is decent if inevitably incomplete, and has, much like the game itself, basically been abandoned by Wizkids). The models are decent; the Clix bases are a good idea, but for physical manipulation and visual impairment reasons I prefer the paperclip method of tracking power levels on the (sleeved) ship cards themselves. The location tiles are black-edged thin cardstock and are likely to fray or become otherwise marked (not to mention that the backs of neither the Romulan nor Dominion expansions match that of the base game), and their irregular-hexagon shape is a rather odd choice that makes handling them a little more awkward than it ought. Even if experience speeds up gameplay some, I think I'm always going to find this too long for quick play but not long, meaty, or strategic enough for "epic" play; the game has the aesthetics of a deep game but has the aspirations (though not the smoothness) of a streamlined Euro-ish game.

On the positive side, and unlike much contemporary Trek, both official and fan-based, this game feels less driven by war and OMG huge fleet clashes than by exploration and limited engagement. More than just flavor text, the Encounter cards often (within the paradigm limits of the design) do a pretty good job of evoking the feel and resolution of particular episodes or plot devices. The rules do leave something to be desired--did we need "greater than or equal" for some skill tests and only "greater than" for others?--but they do give a wide compass for play (combat! scanning! transporters!) without a lot of unique mechanisms. The mission decks are going to inject a lot of randomness, and, yes, you're going to get missions you can't do or at least don't want to do (a problem exacerbated by the half-finished yet still released Dominion expansion, wherein espionage missions requiring cloaking are often drawn by expansion ships not having cloaking devices), but they do generally align in an interesting way with ship capabilities (some ships favor science missions, others combat or influence) and force fluff (Klingons have very few science missions and are much more combat and influence oriented, for example). The variety and composition of the Command subdecks could've been explained better, either through some sort of cheat sheet (like ones you can find in the Files section here) or (in some cases) more transparent names, but they do allow another way to tailor one's options to one's missions and ship selections.

All in all, this is a good game, maybe even a very good one, but one that exhibits a frustrating lack of polish and whose support, both physical and conceptual, by Wizkids has been pathetic. You don't really need much more than is in this box and maybe the Romulan (and maybe even the Dominon) expansion, but think how much better this game would've been with, say, small add-on packs, some scenarios, maybe even a co-op mode against a neutral, AI-controlled Borg?

[Wizkid's Horrible Service]
Firstly a comment about Wizkids. My copy arrived with a few broken pieces and unclickable bases. After a series of email exchanges which lacked any sort of apology (as though it was MY fault for purchasing a faulty game), I finally received the wrong replacement parts. What followed was a typical horror story of bad customer service, in which they stopped just short of saying I deliberately misled them.

[Game Itself]
The game itself is pretty unique in that players are quite free to fly around and perform their actions as though they were actual starship captains. And there are quite a few things to do while trying to complete one's mission.

The one part I found a bit weak (in an overall, pretty good game) was the destruction of enemy ships. The compensation of +1 Fleet Size AND a pick of your next ship for 1 Action seems absurdly powerful. Its almost not in your best interest to kill off an enemy, which plays out a bit weird.

I played this once and maybe it was just bad luck or whatever, but this game STINKS! It's so random it's not fun anymore. Also, it seems to be extremely unbalanced in favour of the federation who mostly have to do easy scanning and influence missions whereas the Klingons are stuck with a heap of difficult combat missions. Oh, and the components are atrocious! I'm giving this a relatively good rating because it at least tells a nice story that stays with you long after you've played the game.

I've played this once but did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would (based on video reviews and other BGG hype/enthusiasm).  It felt very solitary for the first half of the game as we worked our way towards one another and I didn't enjoy the exploration as much as I should have because I was constantly having to fiddle with the Clix and cards.  I don't like the cloaking mechanic but admit I don't fully understand it yet.  I'll definitely give this game another few plays but this might see the trade block in 2013.  I own the expansion so I'm also going to have to try a 3-player game.

I've only played once, so my rating is more of my enthusiasm level than a true fully informed opinion.

My bad luck in this game was rather comical.  I was the first player.  I found a supernova right next to my base.  One ship was destroyed, another damaged, and the systems I had explored were wiped out.  I suppose I should have scanned before going in...

My opponent did no scanning and spread control markers over 4 sectors.

I decided to send my remaining fleet to the same sector, (still no scan), and while safe, I didn't get much done.

My opponent cruised all around and uncovered much more of the board, spreading control markers freely.

I decided I needed to spread out, like my opponent, and promptly got my 6pt Klingon battleship stuck in a black hole.

By then my opponent was winning 6-0.  I conceeded.


So the game is flavorsome.  I like Star Trek, so I should enjoy this universe.  But the game play didn't evoke the theme as much as I thought it would.  

The multitude of cards to pick from is a two-edged sword.  I can see how it will extend replayability.  But as a newbie, needing to evaluate the several decks was daunting.

I'd play again.  But my enthusiasm is muted.  It is a lucky game - flip the right tiles, random encounters, roll the right dice results.  Nothing wrong here, but there are plenty of random elements working.

I suspect that if I played it more, it would become easier to play, and more fun. My first session was a blow out, and that is just going to sometimes happen on games with this many random elements.

Only thing keeping this from being a 10 is poor component quality.  Got rid of the thermoformed tray immediately and put them in large soft dice bags... because I broke one trying to put it away into the tray.  It's not terrible, superglue will fix... just disappointing.

Gameplay is awesome.  Definitely star trek in a box.  My buddy and I are huge trek nerds, and this was a blast to play - we kept hoping to get random encounters.  We may use a variant rule next time where you can choose to take an encounter if you want... they were the most fun part of the game.

Will definitely get this to the table again... hopefully we'll be able to try out the romulan expansion.  Considering using some of the homebrewed borg stuff from the forums as well.

Star Trek: Fleet Captains, designed for two or four players, is set in the "Prime Universe" of STAR TREK (as seen in the various TV series and movies up to Star Trek: Nemesis) and is more adversarial in nature when compared to Star Trek: Expeditions. Each player takes the role of a faction (or race) from the universe. In the base game, the choices are Klingons and Federation. Each faction has a number of ships (on Clix dials similar to the Heroclix line of components) of varying ability and with a corresponding “size.” Fleets of ships are drafted to a given size total which reflects the victory points required to win. Thus, larger fleet sizes lead to higher point (and longer games).

The quality control by WizKids was exceptionally horrendous.  Cheap card stock, paper hexes, and worst of all, clixes that didn't rotate.  When a company focuses all their games around clix, one would expect them to do this well.  I gave up trying to rotate one of the Klingon ships.  There is no excuse for this but thankfully, the game is good.

The ship models look pretty sweet despite the clix rotation not always working smoothly.  Highly thematic as a game goes although this game blends many of the different Star Treks together, including having two different Enterprise models in the game.  The ships drafted inform what goals you select which you should consider carefully as you draft four decks out of nine or so to mix together and use.  (IE, don't take a deck focusing on military if you only have one military goal or two).  Clix are used to indicate your blend of shields, weapons, engines, and sensors.  As a ship takes damage, ship capabilities decrease.

Love this game. Fresh board each time, good minis. This game is a lot of fun and really captures the startrek feel. It does however have one of the worst rulebooks I've ever seen for a game, and because of that it can be difficult because there are lots of minor situational rules that don't even come up every game so it's hard to remember them, then you need to look them up and you can't find them in that terrible rulebook, so you hold up the game finding them ugh.

RATING: 6
Somewhat disappointing game that loses points for some gamey/fiddly rules though the basic engine of the game is decent.  I like the idea of the varied missions and secret missions.  There seems to be just enough combat without it devolving into a free for all.  The resetting of the clicks on the highly fragile and hard-to-handle pieces is tedious and the presence of a stack of modifiers cuts into what should be a more elegant resolution system.  To be fair, I've only played once so perhaps it would low more smoothly with further play.

Originally (2013) rated a 9 rather than a 10 due to -0.5 for component quality and -0.5 for balance issues - tougher to play as Klingons.

Lowered rating a little bit compared to some new favourites. This is still a great thematic game.

If you love Star Trek, any of the series, you must own this game.  It incorporates many characters from truly great episodes and the movies that you will immediately recognize.  The game appears complex on the surface, but it is actually pretty simple to play as the rules are very intuitive.  It plays fast (about 1 hour) and scales to longer games if you want to.  And the ships are so cool.  

The only small issue I have with the game is the heroclix numbers are very small and sometime difficult for me to see.  Other than that, it is a must buy including all expansions.

Flavorful effort at bringing the TV shows to life. It's a bit of a mish-mash but you can find yourself feeling like there is a Star Trek episode happening on the board before you as the game goes on. I guess I do wish the encounters would happen a bit more often, once most of the hexes are revealed it becomes more of a war game.

RATING: 7.5
Fiddly game with poor quality components, a terrible insert, and model bases which need to be disassembled, filed, and re-assembled for the sake of playability.  I will still buy every expansion that Wizkids decides to release for this game.  It is, in a word, sublime.  Feels like a season of Star Trek, every game.  All the complaints over the components are easily resolved with sleeves, model files, and a bit of creativity.  The mechanics work perfectly for the theme, the game is imminently replayable, the limited luck is significantly mitigated, and what story development!  All that being said, the game is long, fiddly, has a ton of components, and an enormous box.

A very cool and fun game. It does capture the Star Trek Theme quite. 

The mechanics are all well done and theoretically straight forward. However, the rule book is definitely not the best and over complicates the actually simple mechanics and leaves certain points unexplained. Also some rules seem overly fiddly for no real purpose. I strongly think this game needs a second, streamlined edition. If they ever release one it could be an outstanding game. As is, I find myself thinking about house ruling certain rules, just to streamline the game.

RATING: 4
Lots of nice miniatures, an overload of tiles and cards, but it doesn't come together in a very good game.  Multiple levels of randomisation (random tiles and randomly chosen encounters randomly determined, random mission cards selected from multiple decks and random command cards selected from certain decks chosen from all the decks!) make it look as if the designer couldn't make up his mind and that's how the game plays. There is no real narrative, and no feeling of flying around a real sector. Made worse by the anachronistic ship combinations, Galaxy class and Constellation class ships together.  Would have loved this as a teen.

Amount of interaction is going to depend highly on the players. The game doesn't really force you into conflict and such. I'm not an informed Star Trek fan, but the fact that there are other types of missions and methods of achievement does make the game quite fun and it does feel Star Trek-y. I wish the hexes were board rather than paper. That alone kind of dials the game down.

RATING: 7
For $70 you're buying some very cool minis...and that's about it—the rest of the components are crap. The card quality and graphic design are crap too. The manual looks like it was designed in the 1970s.

Apart from all that, the game is pretty fun. You need to resign yourself to a big, fat helping of randomness and the thematic nature of the game means there are a LOT of rule ambiguities (here come the FAQs!).Overall, I'm not sure I can see myself buying this game...but I would enjoy playing it again.

RATING: 6
On a first play, this didn't impress me. The components range from pretty nice (the ship models) to near-misses (the iconography, which fits the theme but is boring as hell) to outright flops (thinness of the cards and mats). A lot of corners were cut, and it shows: Compared to comparably priced high-end games with lots of bits like Claustrophobia, Space Hulk 3e, Conquest of Nerrath, and Earth Reborn, the components in STFC fall way, way short.

On top of that, the clix aspect is just annoying. Many of them don't move well, and they add nothing to the game; little markers affixed to the ship cards would have been much smarter. How WizKids went from the ring-turned model to this base is beyond me; ditto with why a company known for painted minis would bother with unpainted ones.

All of that said, the shoddy components and cut corners didn't keep me from enjoying the game -- or wouldn't have, if the game had been more fun. I wanted to feel like we were telling a Trek story, but mostly I was just mildly bored.

I should have been more aggressive and forced more interaction (the lack thereof was part of the boredom -- it was like playing two separate games), and that's probably what I'd do on a second play. And I would play this again, though I wouldn't clamor to.

From reading the rules, I expected an adventure game where you flip a card, perform a test and see what happens. I was pleasantly surprised that every turn feels like solving a mini-puzzle with many options. In that sense, it reminded me of the excellent Mage Knight, but with a greater emphasis on the tactical (as opposed to strategical) decisions. The luck factor is defenitely there, but it never felt out of my control.

Definitely download the faq and a copy of rules for each player.  Took us 3 hours for our first game completely from scratch.  Two ships broken- will look to get replacements.  Rules were long but straight-forward with faq holes.  It would be nice to see an updated version that integrated the Faq. 

Will get little plastic clippy arrows and put them on the ship cards.  Worried I'll break the ships adjusting the deals vs sliding a clippy back and forth on a card.  Also hurts my hands and required a wrench  for the Klingon dreadnaught. 

Didn't like the way the location hexes curled but i guess card stock would have raised the cost another $5 bucks and needed more space in the box.

Enjoyed the game quite a bit.  Lots of laughter which is unusual for a 2 player game.  Not sure it is balanced.

A mix of great and mediocre components make up this highly thematic and satisfying game.  Too much randomness to be strategic, I'm not sure how this one plays for non Star Trek fans.

For me, the biggest drawback is the rulebook.  It is among the worst ever written...completely disorganized and shoddy.  No table of contents, order of sections is simply random, and when a rule is described that interacts with some other rule, there is no page reference to that other rule.

It's good to see a game that at least tries to incorporate mechanics based on exploring the galaxy and colonizing strange new worlds. It's do bad that this game doesn't commit a little bit more to those themes. I think my biggest disappointment with this game is that its influence and installation mechanics feel a bit under-developed and lack utility. I really like the variety and versatility that the command cards provide, and the unique ship abilities provide lots of opportunities for creative strategizing.

Feels like Star Trek all around, great sense of exploring space and having encounters and battles.  Video stills for art is meh and card stock for cards and "tiles" (paper really) is flimsy.

Thinking about this one. Sounds fun but between the price and the cheap card quality I may wait and see. If this was an iPad game I'd buy it in a second.

Update: I can't stop thinking about the storytelling aspect of the game. I love that you get to do so much more then just combat... you get to do the types of things that happen in the shows and books. It will be interesting to see how cinematic and immersive these choices actually are.

I'm still concerned about setup time. I like the idea of deck building before the game but not looking forward to having to re sort all those cards between games.

Update: introduced this to gaming group and everyone was overwhelmed. There's a lot to lure and a lot of time spent reading and explaining card texts. Not sure if his will gt played as anything as a solo game. The randomness makes it a decent solo game but a poor competitive game. 

Note: the game had been collecting dust for so long I decided to donate it to Goodwill.

02/04/17 Played a Klingon vs. Federation game in 123 minutes. 
It was interesting. Actually it was better than I'd feared. But it was still somewhat tedious. The mixing of all eras of Star Trek kind of irked me. The game is all very logical and well thought out. Yet time mostly dragged by, as the first 3/4 of the game we had no interaction with each other. That's rather boring. Also, the HeroClix type bases are *extremely* hard to rotate.  So much so that after two attempts I stopped trying, and had the game owner do it the rest of the game. For I feared I'd have to use so much force I'd break a ship.  He agreed it was difficult to do. He also had painted his ships. I saw photos of them unpainted. Blech!

Played as the Romulans and had fun, but wow did it drag out as the Klingons were always attacking. We played 6 rounds in 3 hours.

Thought the Encounter cards were interesting and the objects added some nice theme and variety.

After several plays, I can say without a doubt that I and my gaming group adore this game. To those complaining about the price and quality control: Wizkids is new to this. Give them a chance. This is a great game and deserves to sell on that merit, not to languish on shelves and end up not receiving the expansion content it deserves simply because people feel they cut too many corners. Personally, I don't see how the game as is could have been made for any less than $100.

RATING: 8
The really frustrating thing for me here is that Star Trek Fleet Captains  could have achieved the heights of greatness. I could easily have seen it achieving legendary 10 out of 10 status which I rarely award and it certainly had the potential to do so but Wizkidz failed to realise the potential and make it reality. And I put it down either to sloppiness or poor decision making as regards the production by the Wizkids, not the design itself which is pretty darn good.

As a game, it works very well. The mechanics flow and there are a good selection of choices to be made. Your strategy will be determined as to which missions are pulled and how you approach them. The turns move along quickly as you become familiar with the system. Its not just a combat game but includes exploration, diplomacy and so many aspects of the Star Trek stories that will keep m interested to replay this game again and again. The key characters are there, other than Benjamin Cisco and Deep Space Nine (big whoopsie on that one guys…). The theme isn’t just pasted on and is completely integral to the gameplay which I think is just brilliant. I felt like I was experiencing a Star Trek adventure and it was darn fun indeed. Its hard to imagine a better Star Trek experience in a board game. I LOVE playing it. I love the variety of missions and events, the changing game board, the easy but effective combat, the cool cloaking rules, away teams, TRIBBLES… All of it really… Fantastic effort to bring in many many of the aspects of StarTrek into a playable game system.

But…

The production, from the broken models, to the card-stock, to the clix base system is just not good enough. If you take on an iconic theme such as Star Trek, the production needs to match the brilliance of the game play. Am I being harsh here? Maybe, but there are high expectations here and that’s the risk you take with an iconic franchise. The game design was failed by aspects of the production. It slightly feels like the models and clix system were paramount which led to some unbalanced production decisions. Wizkids should have done better.

Damn it Jim! I LOVE Star Trek Fleet Captains but why couldn’t they get the production right????!!! This is currently and most likely to end up being, my choice for my game of the year in any case. But it could have been even better!

So, due to this great frustration, I can only give Star Trek Fleet Captains an 8 out of 10 where I so wanted to give it a 10.

Incredibly fiddly and random, but fun nonetheless. It's not really a strategic or tactical game - it's MUCH more a narrative game - I'd compare it to Arkham Horror before I compared it to something like, say, Battleship Galaxies. And sure, players can attack each other and are competing, but in the end, it's much more about the random encounters, the accomplishment of objectives, and the stuff that happens in between.

I have a love/hate relationship with this game. On the one hand, I love Star Trek. I love flying around and exploring stuff, decloaking and ambushing other ships, and spreading my influence across the galaxy. However, I *hate* the minis, specifically the non-clixable (clix as a verb, really?) ships. Stupid. I also dislike the similarity to Arkham Horror (the random encounters with dice rolling, the incredibly convoluted and not-very-intuitive rules). So I'm incredibly ambivalent - maybe a few more plays will cement one side or the other.

Dripping with theme- this game is so immersive, and so tells a story.   The models are great once you paint them.  The rest of the components are bad for a $100.00 SRP, though.  You gotta be kidding me with those dice and the card stock.  But if you have ever wanted to see what it is like to deal with the things a star fleet captain must face, this is your chance.

Updated 11/11/16:  Who am I kidding,  if you are a Trek fan this is a 12 !!!! , otherwise at least an 8.  This is hands down the funnest and most exciting game in my collection.  And that is saying a LOT when I compare it to other great games in my collection (i.e. War of the Ring, Star Wars: Rebellion, Android: Netrunner).  Just LOVE it!!!  Every game is like watching, no - being in an episode or movie of Star Trek, win or lose (I lose more) so much fun!!!

You know there are games that are thematic, and then there are games that are THEMATIC.  This game is OVER THE TOP THEMATIC!!!!!
After 3 plays this game is just FREAKIN' AWESOME! First couple of plays are going to be a bit slow to explain the rules, and figure out how everything fits together (I HIGHLY recommend RangerRob's AWESOME rules reference in the file section).  But once this beauty gets rolling, it's just quite the sight to behold.  Unbelievable, how all the game mechanics just fit so well, and interact with each other.  This game does the Star Trek universe right.  So glad I picked it up!

I agree it is more of an experience game, than strategy or tactics, but it does have those in good doses, as well as luck.  If you ever enjoyed watching Star Trek episodes, you will most definitely enjoy this game, NO DOUBT!

I easily give this a rating of 9, and can see it rising to a 10 after some more plays.

As for the components issues, I really didn't have any issues.  Here is my breakdown of the component quality issues.
1) After I opened the box, there were cards that did break out of their plastic wrapping and were strewn about.  However, there was no damage to them.
2) Yes card quality could be better.  But I have no real issues with the card stock that was used.
3) No broken ships.
4) Yes, some ships are a bit hard to turn.  Problem can be solved easily.  I don't feel I need to do anything at this point.
5) Ships are not to scale.  I don't care, they look AWESOME!.
6) Ships are not detail painted.  I don't care, they look AWESOME!
7) Sectors tiles are thin cards, not thick cardboard stock.  Not really a problem for me.  Does make it easy to shuffle them, and doesn't require an even bigger box.
8) Rules are ALL there.  I suppose they could have been a bit better organized, but I really didn't have any issues with them.

Bottom line.  If you want to play a FUN and THEMATIC (assuming you like Star Trek) game, then this is it!  It doesn't get much better than this.  You will have stories to tell your grand children ;)

No other game out there catches the feel of Star Trek like this game.  Exploration, science, building, combat, this game has it all.  My only complaint is that the Federation wins all the time because the Klingons are so combat based.  The Fed player just avoids you it's tough to get those missions accomplished.

I've only had the chance to play this once. It's got great theme and is a lot of fun, but it quite involved as well. The rule book isn't great, so I'd highly recommend downloading one of the play-aids on BGG.

The clix on the ships are not strictly necessary, as the cards have all the info you need.

If you're a Star Trek fan I would recommend the game. Less so if you're not.

Pricey game based on the Star Trek universe. The game has quite a lot of depth and variety but it let down by poor component quality, particularly the space tiles that make up the board which are thinner than beermats. The plastic ships are also pretty brittle and the cardboard chits are low quality. Just don't get me started on the micro-dice included with the game. When I spend £80 on a game I expect to at least have dice larger than a breadcrumb

RATING: 5
Star Trek: Fleet Captains has been called Star Trek in a box and I agree, they've managed to pull it off pretty well.

The basic gameplay isn't too difficult to learn, but there are some features that can get complicated pretty fast, (cloaked ships, for one).

A massive, sturdy box protects the delicate ships well and houses the other components adequately. The ship models are well-detailed, but not to scale with each other. The instructions are thorough, but terribly laid out; it is better to learn the ST:FC from a veteran player rather than the rulebook. The most disappointing component is the cards, including the locations, which are made out of paper-thin card-stock and are not well finished.

Overall ST:FC is just too fiddly, it takes forever to set up, and the Klingons are at a disadvantage as their warlike nature has fewer paths to victory than the Federation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I've only played this once, so I don't want to pass judgment without having a thorough understanding of the game. I played the 2v2 game as Federation, and I took a beating early game. I had three ships under my command and my Klingon counterpart had the most jacked Klingon ship available. He took it, plus a second ship, and a card that gave him +10(!) to put about 34 damage at my strongest ship and destroyed it outright. That left my other ship undefended, since it was a science vessel, and me at his mercy. I think I need to get a better feel for the combat, since it's REALLY about the initiative. You don't want to be on the receiving end if you can avoid it. I think there needs to be a lot more parrying than I was doing, so the next time I try the game, I'm going to be less indifferent about being attacked. I may even make more attempts to merge forces and go on the offensive. I think I was frustrated by how easily my ship was destroyed and that just soured the rest of the game.

It isn't the best game ever ;) but maybe it is one of the best adventure game I have ever played... 

(If you are a big Star Trek fan stop reading this now and go buy this game. This is THAT game you have wait for all your life)

Pluses:
- The game is full of theme. Even gameplay works great with theme. You feel that this is Star Trek. There is almost everything you can imagine. There are: cloacking devices, taking prisoners from enemy ships, beaming up/down your team on the planet, building outpost/colony/starbase. There are even Tribbles! :)
- Simply rules. Everything is very easy after first play. (But IMO rulebook could be better. 32 pages of rules for such a simply game. Come on!)
- Fast gameplay (but not dynamic because of downtime). Our games took us about two hours each. For this kind of game it's fast.
- High replayability (because of starting deck building, a lot of "space" tiles and big encounter deck)
- Game looks awesome!

Minuses:
- Significant downtime
- This is an adventure game. It has a big random factor.
- Mission cards seem not well balanced. 
- There are no Eras or something. You can have Kirk, Picard, Odo and Data at the same time on a ship. 
- Starships looks great but they are made of a soft plastic. Two models we broke during the first play. Also clix works hard on some models. 
- So small numbers on spaceships clix (For me "6" looks like "8"!)
- Cards are very thin. Not an issue. The problem is that tiles are made of the same material as cards. And this is a problem. Gameboard is hard to manage and tiles lie in little disorder. They should be thicker.

RATING: 6
A fun and surprisingly light 2 or 4 player strategy game, especially given how many options the player has and how complicated everything seems initially!

Despite the game being an enjoyable romp, the production quality is unfortunately quite poor. The cards and location hexes are incredibly thin and prone to creasing, not to mention tearing! Additionally, although the ships look nice (and there are quite a few of them), the "Clix" dials are ludicrously hard to turn on many of the ships in my set.

Felt in love with this beautiful system. It captures the life and death in Star Trek Universe with the thrilling of the explorations. I am a lover of Star Fleet Battles, but with this game I'm having a lot of fun and excitement, without the complications of a very detailed starship combat system.
Only one suggestion. Download the rules of the romulan's expansion! You will find a couple of very simple, but important rules updating for the base system; they change and improve a lot the way you can play and enjoy the game :)

Great thematic game. Feels like Star Trek. Not had many repeat plays due to there only being the 2 factions. Will probably see more plays once I pick up Romulans.

Update: Romulans have increased the number of plays but still does not see that much play time due, mostly I think, to number of players/time.

A 2 player Nexus Ops on steroids, in that you're trying to achieve 10 VPs  by achieving Victory Point card requirements in the same manner as Nexus Ops (ie explore stuff, achieve some combat wins, etc). Rather than growing an army though, you're moving out onto hexes and exploring them to begin with and later engaging with enemy ships or building stuff or other, whatever achieves your victory point cards fastest. Combat is a pretty easy (weapons ratings + potential card modifier + 1d6 > target's shield rating + potential card modifier + 1d6) where ships have 3 damage points. Combining ships as a pack to add ratings together can make sense. There's lots of potential actions to do, making for a busy rules book with the inevitable enormous FAQ due to sloppy cards. Components are an ordinary thin flimsy cardstock, the ship models were mono-hued. There's decent decisions to make each turn, but it boils down to a move, do-stuff and roll to see if you succeed type game, and when this is limited to 2 player, or 2 teams which is admittedly more fun, it didn't do enough to grab me. It feels like you're playing more to enjoy the theme than the game-play and the result is kind of secondary (which it probably is based on how much luck is involved in the VP cards you get and the die rolls along the way).

A 2-player Star-Trek-themed sandbox game using miniatures to race to 10 VP. Massive replayability. This feels like a few back-to-back Star Trek episodes, any series. Large learning curve due to learning the system and the many nuances. The rulebook needs reorganizing. The game needs player aids.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Epic, well-themed Star Trek game. Ships explore, encounter aliens and anomalies, and battle each other.

What I didn't like:
- Combat is pretty much a requirement (I'm a pacifist)
- Fiddly setup (took almost an hour our first game)
- Horrible font makes some numbers very hard to read
- Longer than I would like (our team 12-pt learning game took over 2 hours)
- Some missions seemed very difficult to track

I think the weight of 3.2 might be a bit high. I'll say 3.0.

This was the sort of game that desperately needs a player aid, as you're presented with 20 kajillion things you can do each turn.  Once you get into the game, you kind of get the hang of it though.  I am concerned about game balance, as it seems like it's possible for the Federation to win using their non-interactive stuff before the Klingons can even get to the Federation side of the board to try to win with their interactive stuff.  Component quality is great in some areas, sub-par in others.

One of the better Star Trek games available at this time. 
It is not necessary to be a fan to enjoy the game, but it helps. It's by no means a perfect game, but it can be a lot of fun.

Looking forward to the expansions.

A number of variants are available as well as solo rules.

This is probably one of the most nerdy games I own next to Earth Reborn.

edit: sold. Couldn't get anyone to play this anymore and my wife would only play the co-op variants which were mediocre in my opinion. Sigh. Still a good game though. I stare longingly at the expansion sitting on my flgs shelf and wished someone would have played this game with me.

Deck building / Area control game with public and secret objectives. Feels a little like 3 player Twilight Imperium. The deck building aspect both helps re-playability and hurts in that no matter how you build your deck, there are some missions from each pile that go into your deck. What I mean to say is a military starting ship will still encounter some exploration or science missions and be at a disadvantage, and a science ship will have to do some military. Not to mention, since starting ships are semi-random, there's a pressure to dig for the best ship during the upgrade times. This game also has a TON of downtime between turns, especially for what's basically a 1 on 1 or 3 player (with the expansion) game.

The ships in this game are really fragile, and the bases are hard to turn for the "click" gimmick.

There are some huge loopholes in the rules that completely ruin the game and make the Federation win every time.  For that reason alone I gave it a low rating.  If you modify the rules to adapt, it's actually not bad.   Also, The creator/publisher of the game is "Wizkids", I had never bought a Wizkids game before this, and I never will again.  the amount of broken pieces, printing errors, manufacturing errors, was ridiculous.  I had to go back and forth with wizkids for almost 5 months just to get a proper game. It was also the most painful customer service I've ever had to deal with.

I really liked this game.  The ships are way too cool.  The strategies are deep and fun to play.  

The map board sucks.  Such cheap little hex shaped things.  Way too thin.  They should have been bigger and thicker.  Someone on the files section has a bigger layout you can use.  And get the insert location sheet or you will never figure out where the darn ships go when putting them back in the board.

But I love that fact you can customize the board, the amount of ships and all that.  I have all the expansions and love them.  So many choices and richness added to the game.  

The game also has a good balance of fighting versus earning the victory points.  All 3 games I have played were very close.  This is a great game and would recommend it highly.

Possibly the best board game I've ever played, it neatly encapsulates all the ingredients for a good Star Trek episode(or rather movie). Yes though I wish the quality of the components were better(two of my ships was broken off their bases in transit - easily fixed with superglue), this minor quibble is the solitary wooden outhouse in the face of the all consuming lava flow of fun.

Based on one play: This game was very thematic and enjoyable. One of the best factors was that it always felt like I was able to do something fun, meaningful, and thematic every turn and I was always in the game. I played Mage Knight the next day and there was a stark difference between how difficult it was to do anything in that game compared to how easy it was to do fun interesting things in this one. I am really pumped to play this again ASAP.

After reading all of the negative comments regarding the components and quality control, I am pleased to report that my copy (ordered through Cool Stuff), arrived in mint condition.  All cards were still sealed in their shrink and all of the ships were completely undamaged.  The only minor issue was that one clix (the Yeager) was stuck and would not turn.  However, after reading a very helpful post here on the Geek and easily popping open the base, that problem was quickly remedied.

Having played this a few times must say that we enjoy the game play with it's move, explore and action phases. There is a ton of variety with all the different ships, command cards, missions, events and sector location board layout. It can be fairly quick as well or may play out longer depending on missions drawn. Hope to see an expansion bringing out other races as well.

Updated after more plays.  I REALLY enjoy this game.  It's fast to learn/teach and turns go by quickly.  Doesn't have the tedious downtime of something like Twilight Imperium (which I love, but can just never ever bring myself to commit to a 4-6 hour game) and doesn't take thirty minutes of refreshing everyone on the rules like Arkham Horror always seems to require.

Tons of variability for lots of replayability, though still a surprising balance in the game.  The majority of games we have played ended with final scores within 2 VPs, usually with each player hitting/exceeding the VP goal on the same turn. I am impressed such variability and balance can go hand-in-hand.

This game feels very Trek, and also has wonderful mechanics. Being into Star Trek made it that much more fun, but you wouldn't have to be for some great gameplay. 

There are a variety of approaches to winning through combat, influence, and science so it doesn't have to be combat heavy. Our first game was won by completing science and influence missions, and avoiding the aggressors.

The biggest complaint was a fairly minor game element. It would be nice if the space tiles were better quality and actually looked like open space on the back instead of the Star Trek logo. 

Update: I laminated all the location tiles, and they are much nicer to feel and play with now!

1) It's WizKids so the component quality is absolute garbage. (Also, no one wants to use the damn Clix system stop shoving it in everything)

2) An absolutely shameful lack of DS9 content. (Even in the Dominion expansion) Where is Sisko!?

RATING: 6
An adventure game masked as a strategy game. If you like adventure games and are a fan of Star Trek, it's a must have - it's very thematic and provides a very series-like experience. Others should probably skip it - lot's of rules and not many difficult decisions.

This game just literally drips with theme.  Easily one of my favorite games, although I may not get to play it much and my wife doesn't seem interested in learning.  My only minor quibble is how easy it is to cycle through to missions you want.  I house ruled that to count as an action.

RATING: 4
Overly complex for little reward. You spend more time watching your energy usage and wandering into uncharted space than you do fighting your opponent. The components are cheap (thin cards, brittle plastic pieces), although the artwork is nice. The rules are not well written, but nicely illustrated. Too many rules are devoted to uninteresting things and too little is devoted to action. I love Star Trek, but this game didn't make me feel like I was in the Star Trek universe, but rather in some sort of Star Trek bad dream....or the latest Star Trek movies, whichever is worse.

I will preface this review by revealing that I am a major Trekkie, and I fully acknowledge that my love for all things Star Trek means that some bias will sneak into this review here, BUT this is a fantastic game. It has been said that this game is Star Trek in a box and that is absolutely true. So well designed and obviously created by someone that has love and respect for the IP. There's exploration, missions, encounters with strange alien races, and combat. Everything we love about Star Trek. I do have to comment on the components. The ship clix models are really nice and there are a lot of them! More than you would expect (the box is pretty big). The cardboard tokens are nice and come pre-punched. As for the other components...well, that's a different story. The dice are comically small, and the card stock is so thin on the cards and board tiles you might think it's a joke. I sleeved my cards, and while it made them better, I still have to be careful with them because they're super bendy. I also laminated the tiles with 5mm laminating sheets and a $20 thermal laminator I bought on Amazon. It made the tiles nice, thick, and sturdy and made the game more playable in my opinion. It might be difficult to to play the game with the components as they are. I understand that the quality of some components had to be sacrificed so the game could retail for less than $100, so I personally am not upset by the component quality. I didn't mind making some upgrades (much like Geordie La Forge might do) to make the game components better. The gameplay itself is of the highest caliber. So is it worth it to buy this game knowing you may need to put in some work into the components? If you are a Star Trek fan, this is a no-brainer: absolutely. If you're less than a Trekkie it might be a maybe. My wife, who has no affinity for Star Trek whatsoever, likes the game, but if you don't care about the theme, the sketchy component quality may leave you wishing you had purchased another game (especially considering the price point). But if you like Star Trek, you'll love this game! Qapla'!

I love Star Trek and sci-fi, so this game was high on my list of things to buy. It appeals to the trek fan in me, and that makes me like it a lot.

However, the components are extremely flimsy. The cards are way too thin and made out of inferior materials. For this alone, I can't give it a 10. If the components had been made a bit better, this would have been a full 10.

The heroclix starships are a joke. They come broken and do not rotate freely. You have to disassemble the stands, file all of them down on the inside to remove burrs, then use petroleum jelly to make them turn properly.

The terrible card and tile materials are what kills this game for me, though I really like playing it.

1 play, 4er team game.

It seemed to be pretty fiddly, but there were some neat ideas here. I like the deck customization, the exploration, and mission structure; but it seemed to drag on a bit. I wonder if it's better with just two players? Anyway, I don't think I need to hold on to it; I'd be happy to play someone else's copy from time to time!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The board is made of a number of face down hexes. Each player has a starting hex and area where ships enter the board (and can leave for repairs). Players draw a random mix of ships with point values which sum to the same agreed-upon number. Ships each have unique allocation of their points between 3 areas: science, influence, or combat; players will create personal objective card decks by drawing cards from these respective decks. Also, create personal decks by selecting several decks (4 of 10?), each of which are a different mix of cards with different strengths and weaknesses. Players shuffle their decks separately, then draw 3 objective cards (which become missions; some are left face down, secret from other players) and a hand of power cards.

On your turn, each ship may:
- make one free turn of its dial (there are 3 groups of settings: full health, 1 hit, 2 hits; each has a different mix of numbers allocated to attack, shields, movement, and sensors).
- move up to its movement allowance: 1 to enter adjacent hex, then variable points to cross hex, as indicated on the hex. 
... If discovering a new hex, roll a d6 to see if there's an encounter (hex gives target number); if so, draw from the encounter deck and resolve.
... Hexes may also have special text; resolve as indicated
- play Crew card to a ship; these remain there the rest of the game (but can be discarded for a one-time benefit) and give additional effect (e.g., add to movement range)
- take ONE action:
... attack
... cloak (Klingons)
... scan
... repair (at home base)
... etc.

Combat is against another ship in the same hex. It's fairly simple: each side may play one of their cards, attacker first. Then roll d6 and add the attack or shield value on the ship. Ships may combine their attacks to target a single ship. The attacker inflicts damage based on the ratio of attack:defense, rounding down; for each hit, defender cranks their dial down to the next range (ship is destroyed after a total of 3 hits).

Various actions may satisfy the mission card conditions; if so, place them in your score pile and immediately draw a replacement.

The first player (or team) to achieve the preselected VP target wins!

Playing Fleet Captains provides players with a rich, thematic experience that really [i]feels[/i] like Star Trek. Sure, there are random elements involved, but in my opinion it doesn't detract from the gameplay. I really enjoy the game and do not regret the purchase.

Looking forward to playing a 3-way game with the Romulan Expansion.

Looks interesting but with Eclipse now out, it is not high up on my radar anymore.

RATING: 9
This game is a two player (or 4 player with teams which I haven't played yet) game of exploration and combat.  Players take on a fleet of Federation or Klingon ships and explore unexplored tiles, establish control over locations, build structures, and attack their opponents.  Most of the game's victory points will come from mission cards players have (both revealed and secret) and each player also has a deck of 40 command cards that give them a wealth of other options.

This game is fantastic.  There is so much content and such a wide variety of options to pursue.  Many of the locations have special abilities, there's always the chance to have an encounter that could be positive or negative, the 40 cards that make up your command deck are only 4 of 10 different decks, the ships all have different stats and special abilities, there are 3 different types of mission decks, and much more.  This game is going to feel different every time and, for me anyway, it always feels fun.

The one thing I'm not a huge fan of though are some of the components.  Many might call me crazy for thinking that, especially once they see all the heroclix-style ships...but look closer.  The ships are very cheap feeling and fragile and many of them are the same model with different names.  Just from shipping one of my ships jostled apart from the stand and I needed to superglue it back together.  The art on the cards is good though and aside from the miniscule dice the rest of the components are passable but nothing to write home about.  Also, if you are a fan of Star Trek you will love seeing all the different characters across the universe in one place.

RATING: 7
An exceptional game concept, one that's growing on me. I tentatively rate it a 7 (Pretty good.) My concerns are threefold.

1. The components are not all of the best quality. The tiles really are too thin, and the cards ridiculously flimsy. The satin finish/coating will help mitigate this somewhat, but the old "they spent the money on the sculpts" argument doesn't work here, since this is Wizkids we're talking about, not a smaller company with fewer resources.

2. The rules are HORRIBLY organized. While written well enough, they introduce the wrong concepts at the wrong times, and in fact the document doesn't even get round to describing the actual function of each game piece until AFTER the rules are given, which makes absolutely no sense. 

3. The game is extremely open ended in terms of options on a given turn. A player could theoretically perform several actions before his turn ends. Not a deal breaker, but could be painful when playing against those with analysis paralysis, and with those who intentionally bend   aspects of a game and feign ignorance in order to gain an advantage.

This is Star Trek plain and simple. I haven't seen any other game of any type anywhere that quite captures the feel of the various series (hint: it's not all about fighting). Game play is solid and there is so much variety that even without expansions you can play again and again and not play the same game twice. I recommend getting an expansion to add three player capability. I own the Romulan expansion because I'm a TNG fan and it was the first one available. I agree with others that the hex-tile components are a little weak but with the volume of tiles included the price would be even higher (!) and the box would be bigger (!!). The incredible game play makes up for this slight wearkness. Buy this game.

An experience game for Trekkies. Lots of great ideas - the deck selection and mission generation being the most notable. My rating would be higher by a point if a) I cared about star trek 2) the components were of a better quality. If i'd had to pay for my copy I would have rated it a point lower as the components are not up to the cost of the game

This game is a Trekkie's dream come true.  It's super-thematic and really tells a great story.  The ships are really awesome and the Clix base works perfectly for this game.  This is everything you could want in a Star Trek game.

On the other hand, I think it's a bit fiddly and there's a bit more downtime than I'd like, but that may just be because it was our first game.

I really don't think this is worth the $100 MSRP they're asking and it's barely worth the $70 you can get it for online.  If this was selling for $50 it would be awesome.  The non-ship components should be MUCH better for the price you're paying.

Game itself is an entertaining mix between an adventure game (think firefly, fortune and glory) and a small skirmish game.

Where it really does shine is theme. That literally oozes through everything: the miniatures, the encounters, the command deck cards, the heroclix mechanic used to redirect power... when you play a turn, it feels as if you are performing an episode of star trek the next generation. This game perfectly captures the essence of the show.

Would really, really recommend this to any fan of the show. To non-fans: it is still an ok game, but there are other adventure games that might trigger you more, and there are certainly better skirmish games out there. 

If you look for a combi of these game subtypes and don't mind the space odyssey theme (or want to drag in some trek-fans), give it a look.

I'm a casual fan of star trek, but highly enjoy the immersion into this fascinating universe.

For any fan of star trek or anyone who desires a fun playtime this is the game for you. This game truly exudes "star trek" from every corner and is ripe for expansions. The most important thing to remember in this game is that winning isn't everything. Sometimes you will just be unlucky with dice rolls or card draws but there is still a significant amount of strategy in mitigating the randomness. This game is hilarious (there was one playthrough where we drew the mirror universe card and everyone instantly wanted to put on goatees and so different every time). Amazing for a game group that wants a good time.

Awesome 

Why a 10?

yes the cards ARE too thin, yes the location hexes ARE to thin, my rating is based on the shear ENJOYMENT factor. Yes the rules are a little disorganized, but they ARE ALL there, they may take 2 or 3 readings.(play the game read them again especially the last few pages)

we have played several 2 player games and 1x4 player team game. We thoroughly enjoyed them all. Each time I play I realize that there is more and more to this game than at first meets the eye.

There are times when you don't quite know what to do with your turn other than scan the surrounding areas, however this is part of exploration and discovery that Star Trek is about. The thing with this game is that unlike Fantasy Flight type games ( which I also enjoy ) where every thing has a specific order of events, eg , you must move, before attack, before reinforce etc, with Fleet Captians you have much more freedom to act in whatever order you wish.eg. playing combat cards, we assumed that you had to play them before rolling dice and at same time, however, you can play as soon as combat is declared or wait until the dice are rolled as long as you keep to the one card limit, this adds too the excitement. 

This game is a light strategy game, it reminds me of a good adventure game like Runebound but with lots of player interaction.You can focus on the science missions, or just charge in all guns blazing.

A good example of the feel of the game play . My Son had the original Enterprise, with Captain Kirk, & Spock & Bones. He Explored a Location, it was a an Unstable Wormhole with the chances of new discovery or certain death. " What would Kirk do?" Of course if there's a chance of certain death all ahead full straight through the wormhole! and more things like that...

Some missions seem very easy but every game we play has been very close, and it becomes a real race to reach the target victory points while trying your best to hamper the enemy.

If you like Star Trek you will love this game, if you want an easily playable space adventure that is just fun and does not take itself toooo seriously then this is right up your street.

Board games are about fun, enjoying a bit of unreality with your family and friends, and this one hits the target.

Really looking forward to any expansions, I would like to know what is planned so I can save up. I hope it will allow three player games.

well done to the designers , more please .

A huge selection of sculpted models and there are a lot of options in the game, but for me, it is severely lacking in value for money compared to fun.

It is also weighed down by a lot of rules and exceptions and the numbers on the ships are so small you cannot see what your opponents' ships can do without continuously borrowing their player cards.

There is promise here, but it just doesn't do it for me.

Received as a Christmas gift. A couple of the territory hexes were a little dinged, though.

Update: Played once, in a 4 player team game. It was fun, but felt kind of random.  The encounters accounted for a good 8 points of my team's 18 points at the end of the game.

Update2: The ships are great. The quality of the rest of the components is TERRIBLE.  I still rate it an '8', but this would be a '10' if the card stock was better than it is.  The price point is high enough that having components of that low quality is basically inexcusable.  That doesn't mean that I don't enjoy the game. On the contrary, I do. But it does mean that I can complain about it.

RATING: 7
Star Trek: Fleet Captains is a good game. Not a great game, but a good game. Let me explain:

1 - The quality of the components in this game is horrible. The map tiles are literally as thin as two A4 paper together. As you have to shuffle these tiles every time, and as they are hexagons (no possible sleeve), they will wear out and get marked. This is terrible because a great deal of the game is not knowing the map and discovering locations, and if the tiles are marked, this part is lost. There are 350 cards in the game, and also, most of then must be shuffled constantly. Luckly, these cards fit easily in sleeves (MTG size). The cards are of a good quality, much higher than the tiles, but are still thinner then your regular bycicle card. There are many tokens, but most of then doesn't even need to be used. The tokens are not thin. Lastly, the ships. They are well made (not out of this world good, but you wouldn't complain about their quality). But the clix isn't good. On some ships, it's too hard to clix, on others, too loose. On some ships, the clix only turn to one side. The ships are sorted in a plastic case, but it is very hard to search for the ships in the beggining of the game. The game literally comes with a map of the ships in the case to help, and it helps, but it is still painful. Overall, you feel the game is cheap, like they designed the game and then tried to make the most profit possible. That's the only reason I can find, as this game is very expensive at U$ 80, and you still have to buy boxes to store the components, because in the box you don't have where to put then.

2 - The game itself is enjoyable. The rules are simple, as most things you need to know are written in the cards in the game, apart from the core rules. It is played fairly fast, in about 1 hour for a 2 player game (which I recommend). A two player game has about 6-8 turns (3-4 per player). But the worse part in this game is the waiting. The game is played in turns, as you make everything you want, then your opponent get all his actions, and so on. The problem is that each turn takes about 10 minutes. So when your opponent is playing, there is nothing for you to do, and you just have to wait. In a 4 player game, this is even worse, because you do not play at the same time as your partner. You have to wait for him to play and then make your moves. Overall, this waiting gets the thrill out of the game, and the game feels as it is always being played slowly.
The random factor in this game is very, very big. It is involved in almost all actions. I understand that being this way, the game was able to be playable in 1 hour, but in some cases, the random factor gets frustrating, specially in battle. Every battle has the players throwing a D6 dice and adding the result to the attack or defense. This wouldn't be a big deal if the numbers were all 10+, as the dice would be a medium interference. But when you see that a attack or a defense in a ship is for example 2, throwing the dice can make the attack/defense go up 300%... affecting the overcome completely. After some plays, I can say that when you throw a 1 and your opponent throw a 6, it doesn't feel like bad luck. It feels like a bad designed game, really. The encounter cards can be very bizarre too. You may draw a card that damages your ship and all ships adjacent to it, and then your opponent draw a card that gives him a Starbase (biggest construction in the game) for free, no tests needed. Missions can be really easy, or hard, and this is, of course, determined randomly. The "deck building" is a joke. Just calling it "deck building" makes me laugh. You have 10 sets of 10 cards, and you pick 4 sets. But the sets are VERY generic and look alike, so much that even if the 4 sets were picked at random, it wouldn't make too much difference. Discovering the map is fun because there is the chance of an encounter, but the tiles itself has VERY little difference and impact in the game, apart from some special ones. Combat is also fun, apart from the dice.

3 - The game is VERY well themed. I mean, if you are a Star Trek fan, you will really enjoy this game. But when I say this, understand that I say a real fan. I really like Star Trek, I watched all the movies (I have all of then in my collection) and enjoyed, and watched a great part of the series. But I can't say an Enterprise ship number out of my head with 100% conviction. With that said, I enjoyed the theme, but it wasn't enough for me to give this game even a 8, for example. A real Star Trek fan would enjoy this game much more, even though the game is obviously flawed.

4 - Check the rate 10 reviews. 99% of then are of big Trek fans, and they overlook any problem the game has (some of then even admit it). Rate 9 reviews are of big Trek fans, that were unable to overlook the horrible components, but overlook any other problem.

5 - Last words: the random part can be overlooked, if you don't look to this game as a strategy game (calling it a strategy game is a joke, as the only action you do without randomness is building construction and scanning tiles). Considering this game as an adventure game, it is pretty enjoyable. It is played in a light tone, because with so much random, you never lose a game and think "I played poorly". In the end, you just do what you can with the cards given to you. So, a light game, fast and with lots of random. I gave a 7 for this game overall pratically ignoring the components quality.

Denser and (much) shorter and than Twilight Imperium, with added Star Trek theme.  I like the variation introduced by the mission card changes and deck selections.  Our game had less interaction than I was expecting, but that might change in a different game.  I enjoyed this and would play it again.  One gripe though - the clicky bases are horrible: way too stiff and difficult to see.  Next time we'll ignore them.

Star Trek: Fleet Captains is an experience game first, drenched in flavor text and Clix minis.  But there's also a fast-moving game of exploration and conflict in that big box, and it meshes with the Star Trek universe quite nicely.  Some messy design choices and a massive rulebook make this harder to learn--and to teach--than it should be.  Setup and takedown are significant.  But the game engine is solid, making this my favorite experience title.

The Admiral of Star Trek games, Fleet Captains perfectly captures the exploration, characters, diplomacy, and action of the series' in boardgame form. The components are more TOS-quality, and the mandatory clix-bases are as annoying as Tribbles, but this is otherwise a fantastic game for Trek-fans everywhere.

I really enjoy this game! It's not a complex game, but it will be overwhelming at first to new players. DON'T GET DISCOURAGED! Play a few games and to get the feel for it. It is a lot easier than it looks but don't quit on it before actually getting to understand or play it. 

I like the mini deck building in the beginning, the exploring, the strategy, adding crew to your ships, transporting crew off of peoples ships as prisoners lol, battles, cloaking; everything. It's just an overall great experience and game. 

My only gripe with the game is not from the card quality, but actually that there are not enough tokens (such as +2 shields, + 1 Engines, etc etc.) When you have a lot of modifiers to your ships as well as your opponents ships, you may run out of the tokens real quickly. It's not a big deal though, just wish they had more.

This game is a lot of fun and I can't stress enough how important it is to sit through this game and play a few games until you get a better understanding of the game because the enjoyment is so much more when you ACTUALLY understand everything.

Last thing, print off what I like to call the "Abridged Rules" from BGG and use those to help introduce it to new players. It's easier to read than the 32 page instructions that the game comes with. Oh and always keep a bottle of Superglue in your box! You'll thank yourself later for it!

Ships are great but besides the production quality is pretty crappy. A game this expensive mustn't come with dented cards. Interesting game with a narrative arc. But 2 factions only? In - again - a game this expensive? Really? Makes the narrative pretty scripted.
Mhhh, what will the militarywise strong Klingons try to do?
What kind of strategy will the influential federation pursue? Will definitely not buy into what will be most likely totally overpriced expansions as well!

As someone who enjoys Star Trek, I liked having a variety of ships from the series, but that's about the only thing that really worked for me with this game. The component quality really isn't a deal-breaker for me; it's the thematic shortcomings that really bother me. I wish that the designers had chosen a particular era and stuck with it. The rules are very fiddly, so instead of feeling immersed in exploration, I mostly felt like I was managing an office: worrying about power adjustments, discarding and drawing cards every turn until I get a mission that I can accomplish or a command card that is useful (I found the command deck construction aspect tedious), scanning to make sure that I didn't fly blindly into a black hole, allocating actions between various ships. And if any theme is crying out for a good cooperative game, it's Star Trek. Yet this game insists on forcing the players into armed conflict. Should I keep it just for the ship models... we'll see.

Silly and over the top Star Trek game which is an absolute blast to play. Very thematic with lovely model ships, crew cards (complete with quotes...) and tasks which have you completing science, engineering and tactical missions while encountering all manners of clichéd events.
The game is unfortunately let down by poor quality components; flimsy card location tiles, HeroClix ships which don't quite 'clix' and a rather poorly written rulebook, but thankfully playing the game largely makes up for these issues.

This is definitely a game for Trek lovers. While I am not exposed to other ST designs, this is as close a game to the Trek universe as you will get. The design is amazing and stays really true to the Trek universe and canon. Unlike Star Wars where action is fast and furious with lots of space combat, ST has always been more focused on space exploration, planetary excursions, conflict resolution between intergalactic species, temporal distortions, spatial anomalies and trans-warp technologies. However, when combat in deep space occurs, it is often a slugfest between lumbering capital ships and not between the nimble and maneuverable one-seat starfighters.

This game captures the essence of ST where all the ingredients I described above are incorporated into the game. I love how the command deck enriches the game play by introducing elements from different story lines derived from the various series: Tribbles, Q, Borg, Dominion, etc. they are all there. While this is a mish-mash of characters, it is possible to carefully craft a deck to reflect a particular story arc. Still, this is a minor concern. While the rules are more complex than your regular Euro genre, the complexity is quite intuitive and makes a whole lot of sense. This really makes the game flow better. The variety from the encounter/mission/command decks will make this game stay fresh throughout the years.

A few minor concerns: the clix can be quite tough to rotate and frequently, one has to be careful not to break the base from the ship.  The components such as the hexagon maps are really substandard and thin. Inexcusable. Finally, I really wish the Federation ships are uptoscale. At least Enterprise E, the flag ship should be larger than the USS Sutherland. Hell, the size indicated on the ship cards is larger but the physical sculpt is actually smaller. Just not cool

It's Star Trek. Getting a crew together, exploring space, being prepared to defend yourself from other races. Red shirts don't die enough but it's bloody fun otherwise. The components could have been better (I'm looking at you cardstock!) and the print on the clix could be bigger.

Sounds REALLY cool, but pretty expensive.  I keep flip flopping on this.  On one hand the game play sounds awesome, but there seem to be some quality control issues.  Mostly damaged or poorly assembled ships and thin tiles.  I may want to wait until they come out with a 2nd printing where they may address these issues, but who knows if that will ever happen.  I might want to jump on now and hope that if there is a reprint they offer an upgrade pack.  What to do?

Tremendous replayability and numerous paths to victory make this the best Star Trek board game ever produced. The ships themselves looks great, though the rest of the game's components are unfortunately cheap. The rules are good, though the writing and editing in the rulebook itself leave much to be desired (grab the very large FAQ document before playing). Even despite these warts, it's a gem of a game and just plain fun.

Each player begins play with a fleet of ships and starts at opposite ends of an unexplored sector of space. This sector of space is represented by hexegonal cards (which are shuffled before play and placed face-down in a pre-determined pattern). As each ship progresses through the sector, you turn the tiles face up, revealing what is in that part of the sector (a Class-M planet, a Class-J Nebula, empty space, etc...). Hopefully you will discover and acquire resources while simultaneously denying them to your opponent(s).
\13\\13\
When conflict inevitably breaks out, you and your opponent(s) will battle it out for sector supremacy. Last fleet standing wins the sector for their respective faction.
\13\\13\
Each ship will be on a base with a dial and accompanied by a "Ship Card". The Card denotes three different statuses for each ship; normal operating, Yellow Alert, and Red Alert. Each status affects how your dial plays as well as how the game and your opponents interact with you.
\13\\13\
There is also a deck of cards involved that each player brings with their fleet, and these are used during gameplay to affect the outcome of battles, player interactions, etc...

RATING: 7
This is a totally new direction for Wiz-kids and I think I like it. Not only have they found an alternative use for their clix dial, they have released the best Star Trek game ever made. The scope of the game is something I'd expect to see from Fantasy Flight, as is the token count. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that the stock of both the cards and the tiles are way too thin for the frequency with which they are handled. I also suppose the anachronistic nature of having Federation ships from different eras exploring the galaxy together will make some Trekkie's head explode, but I don't follow the timelines closely enough to care. It really is a solid game, I just wish the price point wasn't so high. I'm afraid the game would wear out before I'd gotten my $100 dollars worth out of it.

UPDATE: While I think this game is on the right track for creating a great Star Trek experience in a boardgame, I can't shake the feeling that the balance of the standard rules are a little off. Every game I have played, one or both players have achieved 3/4 of their victory conditions before the galaxy has been fully explored and in many cases, before first contact between the players has even been occured. Maybe that's intentional, but it sure feels weird. I should have an opportunity to play with the expansion sets soon, so I will see if they improve the experience.

If you're a Star Trek fan, this is a gotta have.

The title says it all...you control a fleet of ships, taking on missions, confronting enemies and dangers in unexplored space, and sometimes getting some good fortune along the way. 

Even though winning this game is based on collecting Victory Points, it is so rich with Star Trek/Space exploration theme and content that collecting VP is merely a by product of enjoying the perks of finally being 'at the con'. We do not use the dials on the ships, we use the ships cards with paper clips to mark the current alert status. That being said, the ship details are very nice indeed and if there were more time to play a game of this length, which can go upwards of 2 hours or so, then it would be one in which I could say I would be willing to play 'anytime'.

 It's a planner, a thinker, but a whole lot of fun...and I do not think one needs to be a 'Trekkie' to appreciate it. It is good enough that we are making room on the shelf for the Romulan expansion.

I agree with the general consensus that this game has very cool ship models with subpar cards and tiles. I can deal with that.

I bought mine slightly used for a good value.

RATING: 6
I was expecting a light, thematic  game of space exploration and combat.  But with 60+ minutes of setup and rules explanation for our first session, Star Trek: FC isn't nearly as light as I was hoping.

Not that the game is particularly heavy.  It isn't.  But it's heavy [i]enough[/i] that it'll likely only hold the attention of Trek-loving adults and older teens - meaning that it just won't fly as a family game.  So there go my holiday gift plans for the year.

As to whether the game strikes the proper balance of length and randomness, my initial evaluation is somewhat negative.  The semi-strategic elements that do exist - maximizing battle odds, juggling VP goals, long-term planning - are counterbalanced by pointy-eared heaps of chaos that will penetrate your dilithium tolerance shields no matter how powerful they might be.   

And then there's the "boldly exploring" bit.  That's where I was hoping that Fleet Captains would tickle my fancy, but the archetypal Star Trek shenanigans appear infrequently at best.  The most thematic aspects of the game are found in the encounter deck, and an encounter only appears on a low-odds die roll when a new hex is flipped.  The hexes themselves aren't terribly interesting as explorables, and after the first game you've seen most of the hexes anyway.  So the novelty of exploring new worlds wears off after only a game or two, I think.

Finally, the coordination between team members in the four-player game results in an avalanche of downtime.  So the impatient and foolhardy (i.e., me) will inevitably suffer. Besides, a single card - fooled you! combat canceled! - can nullify a team's best-laid plans regardless of whether they spent six or sixty minutes weighing their options.

Not a purchase, clearly, but I would play again - with two players, at least.

An interesting game with good theme. The portrayal of the plastic ships is awesome and they could be painted for customization too. There's good strategy, tactics, and depth. The replayablility is strong.

The overwhelming difficulty I have with Fleet Captains is that it's so fiddly and tedious. The setup is pretty long, you really need a lot of space to keep the game board organized and the amount of game information to absorb per turn is extremely high (lots of modifiers for ships, cards, etc). It can be a fun game for sure (especially for trekkies), but it's too tedious an experience for me.

Typical 4X game of exploring stars and planets.  The minis look nice, but the cards are flimsy.  The missions add some twists ala Nexus Ops, but they are a missed opportunity because they are so generic (e.g., destroy an enemy ship) and often boring.  Why not give the missions more of a story to them.  Similarly, some of the encounters are a bit interesting, but I was surprised there were not more encounters with alien races.  At least the game keeps moving and you don't get stuck for hours working on technology tracks or building up your army.  I was hoping for more tactics in combat beyond move into the same place, maybe play a card, and simply roll the die.  The major shifts in your spaceship's abilities seems a bit gamey.

I had been meaning to pick this one up for a while.  It seemed to get great reviews and I'm a huge ST:TNG fan, which seemed to be reflected well in this games theme.
As it is, I went and picked up the game and both expansions all at once, and after having played it a few times now (both with and without the expansions)I can say the reviews are well warranted. If you are at all a Star Trek fan, you'll really enjoy this one.  Despite it's high random luck factor (card draw, random board, dice roll, etc..) it manages to keep me engaged (no pun intended) because the mini stories it weaves are so thematic.  When you get stuck in a time loop, you have a whole episode play out in your head.  When a romulan ship uncloaks, I play the romulan theme in my head (I actually started playing each race's theme on everyones turn.  totally gets everyone in the mood)
Now, the warning
WARNING!!!!  This game is VERY VERY VERY random!  You can end up being screwed over by bad luck, and no amount of tactical finesse will get you out of it.  But, like i said earlier, that's entirely forgettable.
What ISN'T forgettable is the fiddlyness of the rules.  While, on the surface, they seem straight forward (and they really are), you'll often end up in situations where you must house-rule something because it just isn't clearly written out how something should play out.  This seemed to happen most with the random mission cards - one had you "place a crew card on an enemy ship", which [in the context of the expansion with saboteurs/espionage missions] most likely was meant to read "place a saboteur on an enemy ship", but could also mean "transport a crew member to an enemy ship" who's only purpose aboard an enemy ship would be to become "prissoner/cargo", as the rules imply - especially important to distinguish because only two of the four races have the ability to place saboteurs on enemy ships, yet all four can transport crew/cargo... so if all races need to be able to complete this kind of mission, shouldn't you allow the transporting version of the rule even though it is LESS thematic?.   
These kind of things seemed to come up more often than they should ("is this mission's two system tests supposed to be done at the same time?  can I do one one turn and the other on my next turn?  can I make a combine test with two ships?" etc...).  They're not game braking per say.  But, if you go into this game wanting a purely fair and competitive experience, you'll probably end up arguing with your opponent over some vaguely outlined mechanic or another, just to win that one victory point you need to end the game.  If you don't have an interest in prolonging the game for the theme's sake, you'll despise this aspect of the game.
On the other hand, if (as I said above) you are at all a fan of the setting and theme of this [essentially sandbox like] game, you won't care about the poorly written instructions.  You'll simply imagine how the event might play out in the show and make up a rule that best fits that interpretation.  It's a testament to how well themed this game is that it almost entirely overrides my OCD/type A need for order over chaos, rules over anarchy,  logic over illogical.  This one might even make Spock smile.

Great game but component are low quality , thats why i gave it 8 instead 9!
Cards and tiles were still little wet , and hexes(tiles) came in 4 different sizes(1-2 mm cutout difference) so shuffling is hard lol

For once I must concur with doctor Vasel: this is Star Trek in a box. As we all know - cards are very thin and are prone to wear and tear. Too bad it is largely a solo effort, but highly thematic. Too expensive and it yearns for an expansion, at least one.

Mixed feelings - very rarely played, but cannot give it a bad rate.

I like it, but I don't love it. I think I will love it with more chaos, which means I need to break out the expansion with a third player, which could make this a 10 for me.

I think my rating will increase if we sit down an play it more, currently it is just a complex game that sits and we talk about it. The few times we have played it was fun

Have to be in the mood for this one.  A party game that can drag on far too long.  WHY IS IT CALLED TURBO?????

An update to Cranium, the now classic party game. A thrift store find. Like new.

Recommended with 4, 6, 8-10, and 12 players. 60 mins.

Much faster than regular Cranium.  Pretty good for a party game!

RATING: 5
One thing about the game is that it is at least varied.  Even if there's too much luck involved in moving on regular spins, the activities are generally OK.  It takes too long to play, however.  You get to the finish, and you still have four more things to do...a little much.  Not too bad, however.

Another classic from my pre-hobby gaming days.  There are better party games now.

Haven't pulled out Cranium in a while, but I loved how with many of the Cranium games they could be played as individual players or as groups. My favorite moment playing this game will forever be my Grandma humming a tune and then when the time was up admitting to everyone that she had no idea what she was humming. Definitely one of those games that brings families of all ages together.

An attempt to make Cranium a shorter game.  It's not quite that successful at that, but it's still a lot of fun.  The randomizer gadget is cool.

Okay party game, but the difficulty level of cards is all over the map... from obscure people & places to simple objects like "bicycle".  Therefore, luck of the draw is significant (i.e. you hope you don't get stuck with Trafalgar Square as your first card).

Takes too long to play. It suffers from the same problems many other American roll-and-move games do. Not tactics, just take it as it comes.

It's Cranium, yet again.  Still fun for the right group.  The timer plays an annoying tune for 60 seconds, so for some events it just sucks.

There is a category or puzzle in this game for everyone. Lots of laughs and it is fun to see people's talents come out while playing. (10+ plays)

Lots of things to do, and lots of possibilities for humor in a large group! One of the most inventive party games I've played!

Plus, the drum beat of the electronic timer has become my new theme song.

Likes: Cranium is just a good time!

Dislikes: The Sculptorades clay given dries out way too easily, especially since people tend to distract themselves with it.

Some of the activites are fun (like using one of your team as a puppet to act out something), but it's absolutely silly to have things with such a wide range of difficulty within the same category (true/false versus multilpe choice for instance).

This is probably the only game where you need to make a fool of yourself that I enjoy a good amount. With my family this usually provides a lot of laughs.

RATING: 5
You have to have the right group of people to play this game.  A group that's willing to be crazy can make it fun, but it depends too much on the skills of the people playing rather than good design to make it fun.

For Cranium I wrote "Terrific family game, terrific party game.  You may not remember who won the next day but you'll remember the laughs you had for months."

This is basically the same game with new cards, a timer and a few tweaks.  Love the original game and love this.

RATING: 7
My original favorite party game. It incorporates so many different versions of party games: charades, spelling, drawing, trivia, etc. No one seems to want to play games like this any more, but I still enjoy it.

Adding to the already popular activities of the original game, players will now find themselves making puppets of their friends, reading each others minds, noodling over uncommon facts, gazing at close-up images, and figuring out which items are not like the others, while racing against the clock. Cranium Turbo Edition includes 1,000 all-new cards; 16 activities, including six that are new, an exciting new electronic timer with music and lights and a faster paced, 3-questions-in-60-seconds Turbo Rally Rounds. 

Maybe replace my Origanal Cranium?? (keep and use old cards??)

It's fun once in a while. I like other party games better most of the time. The rule changes seem to balance out between things I think are better and things I think are worse so it stay about where I'd rank regular cranium.

Not something I want to play often or with only a few people.  You really need at least 4/team to make this game fun.  (otherwise you get someone like me who knows jack about pop culture and you you're screwed)

The turbo name obviously doesn't refer to the speed with which the game is resolved (at least with 4 teams)

RATING: 4
Maybe there's something wrong with me, but I find this game dull, dull, dull. I didn't like playing standard Cranium a few years ago, but decided to give the Turbo version a try and was very disappointed. The tasks are either way too easy or way too hard. When we played, we FORCED ourselves to laugh, which in itself was fun, but we could have done that without the game.

Surprisingly this is my favorite version of this game. Streamlined movement and game play coupled with the addition of an electronic timer and Turbo Rally questions makes the game fun for once and resolves some of my problems with the original design.

Best version of Cranium with most varied gameplay, nicest components, most fast-paced feel and most replayability. Cranium itself already being probably the single best party game, not just for it's diversity but for the way it makes all the variety work together in such an elegant way rather than a contrived way. Cranium is a fun, low-luck, high-thinking, fast-paced and fun fun fun party game and turbo edition is the most nicely produced.

UPDATE: This game is starting to show it's age. There are simply more fun party games out there. Getting Telestrations and Dixit because I feel like they will be more fun and more ever green. Furthermore, Reistance, Werewolf, and other bluffing/secret identity games supplant this one along with Balderdash. Cranium while accessible, no longer has a place in my collection.

Played this once with Marcel and Gwen. Seemed like a lot of fun. However, the "puppeteer" cards seem to require more than 2 players per team.

Also, if you don't know a lot of pop culture, you might be screwed, so again bigger teams are better.

A pretty cornerstone party game.  The turbo edition adds something extra which is good.  You have to do a lot of silly stuff, so it's good to play with close friends and family.  It can take a while, but is perfect for large groups as teams.  It can be frustrating though when your team gets "make the civil war with clay in 20 seconds with no gestures" and you opponents get "True false" questions.  All in all a good one to bust out every once in a while.

Fun with the right group of people. I do like this better than regular Cranium. Had to buy playdough - the stuff they had in the box dried out within a couple of months.

I don't really care for Cranium.  It takes to long, and the various questions/mini games can be more annoying than fun.  This one is extra annoying because of the electronic dice/timer.

Best version of Cranium I've played. It has the best categories/components (no dried out clay), and it has plenty of replay value. Really fabulous party game for a large group.

A fun game, although there are much better party games out there. The variety of question types means that you'll almost certainly end up doing poorly in some area, and then the game drags when you get those subjects. The electronic timer is a little annoying, too, especially when you're trying to whistle/hum something!

The amount of fun is based heavily on the personalities in the room. I enjoy this game

I like this as a party game because you get to get more active than all the other ones I have.  There are charades, singing, drawing, and even an improv-style game where you have to move another player into different positions.  There's also general knowledge questions, picture identification, and other stuff.  All-in-all a very good variety of different things to do.

This edition comes with an electronic device that selects the category of your activity for that round as well as the number of spaces you get to move if you get it right (yes, basically a roll-and-move mechanic, ugh!).  The worst part about this game though is the clay.  It is awful.  Even on first opening the game they don't seal it well and it is already hard and crumbly.  You can knead some life into it but it is difficult to do anything with at that point.  It sticks to everything and crumbles and makes a mess everywhere.  I hate it!

Similar to the basic Cranium game, the Turbo edition uses an annoyingly noisy and flashy electronic device in place of a timer and rolling dice. The original version of the game seems a bit more classy to me.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
No other party game gets the players more involved than this!  I especially like the different categories as they appeal to just about everybody.  I would definitely recommend it for families!

I am not sure what makes this game "turbo" though since it really doesn't play any faster or provide a more intense gaming experience.

The game components are very nicely done and attractive.  My only complaint is in regards to the clay provided - it has to be even cheaper than Play-Doh and doesn't last for very long!

A dexterity game with some of my favorite characters in board gaming. Unfortunately there is no excitement here, which is something I really look for from dexterity games. I could be convinced to play it again, but I certainly don't need to.

Ordered it as part of the Devastation of Indines Kickstarter.

I found that this game ended up being to fiddly with all of the powers and keeping track of health.  I'm typically not much of a dexterity game person, but would prefer something that is simpler rules (Crokinole, or Elk Fest)

A finger flick could either win you the game or send your disk flying to the floor. Another fun game where in order to win, you have to do your best to eliminate the other players, before they eliminate you.

UPDATE 3/11/2014: I have got quite a few more plays in of this and I absolutely love it even when I lose.  My latest play was against my brother.  It was a quick 2v2 intro game.  I lost pretty badly, but I think I would have had a better chance if I had remembered my own character's ability.  We started with an 8 card draft where after each player was picked, we passed the draft pile and drew back up to 8.  I feel like I got some good characters.  I went with one ranged character and one with an AOE for extra damage.  I went for some items after taking a 2 damage beating and happened to pull the dynamite too far away from any enemies to pass it along and died right there.  And then when I tried to at least even the score by taking out one of my brother's duelers, I forgot about my AOE and went for knocking him off the table instead. I think maybe I just wasn't thinking clearly after having one of my guys wiped out simply because of the luck of the draw on items.  But, regardless of how the game went, I still enjoyed it.  That tells me that this game is a solid 10 in my book.  My two youngest kids (6 and 7) and my 13 year old all love this game almost as much as I do.

I have only played this game once and it was against my 6 year old son. We didn't use items and we only did 2vs2. But I love dexterity games and that one play was amazingly fun. I only won by 1 hit point in the end. The concept is simple enough that my son was able to pick a good lineup and he picked up the movement vs attack concept very quickly. I can see immense potential in this game. Add to that the fact that I love dexterity games.

This is a great game from one of my favorite companies, level 99 games. My kids and I have so much fun playing this. It is a fun game, however the rulebook is terrible. It was missing key rules and the ones that are there are ambiguous. I recommend this game, but keep in mind it is a simple flicking game with rules issues.

RATING: 7.5
Super fun dexterity game that really feels like a massive arena brawl. Varied and interesting character powers and items add a layer of fun. Needs a large, flat play surface and can be quite fiddly with character health and cards.

I like this dexterity game;  cool art, the excitement of picking up special items, using your skill for attacks and tactics of which character to use and who to attack.  There is huge flexibility on how many players can play and there is always fun banter and laughs when this is on the table (of course anguish too when your move doesn't work the way you want). Equal fun with my 10 and 12 year old boys and our regular game group.

RATING: 7
I like this game a lot!  I feel that everyone should own at least one dexterity based game, and I would recommend this one.  The only issue is that if you don't have a large table, then the game is almost unplayable.

Basically, you flick little discs that represent characters.  They move and attack by flicking them across the table.  What makes this game really cool is that you actually build the terrain yourself.  I've used books, cups, rocks, and various other things.

I haven't had the chance to really play this game with other people, but I've played solo and really enjoy the mechanics of the game.

I don't get to play this very often but it's a rather fun "minis game" with a cool combat resolution system. Obviously designed by someone who really knows what they're doing given the range of different powers and how they interact with dexterity.

A pleasant disc flicking game that would be perfect for recess if I was still in school for young people. The added player affects are novel, but almost got in the way of what is really just a silly dexterity game. I'm happy to of played it once and would not need to revisit this one.

Excellent little dexterity game. The characters add a level of theme and interest to the disk-flicking nature. It is pretty freeform (ie you have to make your own map, I find coasters and books work very well).

It also would have been nice if it game with some damage counters so you will have to provide your own (use pennies or something)

I wish the game came with terrain, though lacking it makes the process of setting up an arena more satisfying when you think of something really cool to do.

Other than that: A disc-flicking combat game with lots of special abilities. Some abilities seem better than others, but there's enough drafting and target choice to smooth that out. Surprisingly awesome.

Flicking fest. If you like flicking, you will like this because it's quick & fun.
If you don't like flicking, then this is not your game.

They've got some very funny modes.. like playing soccer or volleyball while at the same time trying to eliminate the oposing players.. pretty funny stuff.

If you don't mind the open ended rules and very flexible structure (which I love) this is a must buy DEX combat game! Gives you much more depth than it's apparent from the rules or videos. Possible because you have 3 character team to play with and even strategize! Had a blast with different sized groups (2, 5, 8)! Small package means this will follow me everywhere from now on :)

Dexterity game. Flick the various World of Indines characters into terrain and, hopefully, each other.

Rather hampered by the need for terrain without actually including any. Also just not very flashy in general. Compare it to Flick 'Em Up or Cube Quest and... yeah. Gotta admit production values/components aren't up to standard.

Fun dexterity game, doesn't require too much thought as in this game you just have to be good with your flicking finger! 
Loads of game modes like elimination, racing and even football! The vast amount of character cards and item cards ensure the game never gets dull.

A nice dexterity game, with looooooots of characters that have different abilities and powers.

PROS
- Massive replayability with all the content included.
- Easy explanation and gameplay.

CONS
- It requires a surface and some random objects to act as obstacles.
- Some people may find the abilities too much for a dexterity game, just wanting to flick disks around.

Flicking dics game is pretty cool. The special powers make it more interesting. Although I would prefer not having a built in mechanism for knocking discs off the table since it just seems like a recipe for losing things in every corner of the room.

RATING: 7.5
Fast dexterity game that gives the players just enough strategic options to feel like they have good decisions to make beyond simply flicking well. Good fun, though the manual suggests this is more of a game kit (supply your own terrain, make your own game modes), what is printed here is worth trying.

Dex game to knock everyone out! shoot the discs to get the hit points and knock people out! Reminded me of Flick 'em Up- made me want to play Flick Em up more.

Feb. 2014: Played Josh Edwards copy in a 4-player game with John Sizemore and Lynn.  It wasn't horrible, but not my kind of game.  Sort of a cross between Magical Athlete, Crokinole & any game with lives.  Most importantly, it needs to be played with folks who *want* to play it. Also, it would be great if the components allowed for different colored discs for different players so that you could assess the board more quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The printed rules are woefully incomplete, failing to mention basic rules like 'ranged attacks' or providing enough of a formalism to work out character power interactions.

The game itself is simple and fun with lots of variety.  The basic elimination game suffers from turtling unless it is on a small arena, in which case it suffers from random kingmaking and simple leader bashing.  However, the variants show a lot of promise and will likely remove all my criticisms.

update:  the variants are indeed interesting.  Also, the games are lightning fast and brutal, but still offer tactical maneuvering.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fine for a 2 player game but in multiplayer you can get ganged up on and swiftly eliminated. There is nothing you can do to defend yourself. There's is no negative reprocussion for ganging up and no diminishing return for continuing to dogpile on a player. Also, as should go without saying in a game with this many characters, the characters are not balanced. If you want a light dexterity game, this is a good one. If you like having a semblance of control over what's going on, you'll probably end up frustrated.

Fun, light dexterity game. Would be a seven, but the rulebook completely omits key rules (ranged attacks and item capacity). Marketed as a sandbox game but feels half-baked. And sorting characters during set-up is a bear due to lack of names on discs. No way to mark damage included in box. Still fun if you like flicking and fighting.

Here's what you get: some wooden discs, some cubes, some character cards with variable stats (health, attack, move) and a special ability, some treasure cards, and a rather bare-bones rule set that encourages player customization. 

Here's what you do: flick your wooden discs at your opponent's discs while leveraging whatever powers/items you have.

While that may not sound like the most stellar of endorsements, I actually find the game rather endearing! It's simple fun that plays quick and is inviting to non-gamers. (There's also a draw if you're into Level99 Games or their Indines universe, but that's really just icing on the cake.)

Competetive Catacombs, without the fun.  In our 5P game, one of my characters was dead before my first turn and the others powers were useless, and they died after the second flick.  Once the field was down to two players, we all had to wait 30 minutes while they dodged around each other.

Fairly fun dexterity game, very light rules make it good for tired evenings, younger kids, or newer gamers. Quite "moddable," with lots of variants, which is nice.

I am not a huge fan of flicking games, but within that genre Disc Duelers is a pretty good choice. Mainly because the discs are durable and very smooth, rules are really simple and a game of it is usually pretty short. In my opinion, these are all requirements for an enjoyable disc flicking game. The main drawback of this game is that the rulebook is really loosely written. Almost expecting the players to fill in the blanks. Certainly not everyone's cup of tea. And again, I personally need to be in the mood for a dexterity game - something that does not happen very often.

Fun little game that has no problems getting on the table and keeping players of all types interested until the last flick. Love how the rules are versatile to add more replayability.

A fun, chaotic game of beating up the people in front of you, behind you, and cursing the people to the side of you.   Racing is involved.

Not a true "strategic" game, but it was a good time, and fun for what it is.

We wanted to like this game and we had a fun to a certain degree while playing it. But that was thanks to the theme and graphics. Yet the gameplay itself was lacking. I felt like I didn't have any interesting options. Almost all my turns were no-brainers, everybody in place would've played the same card. I just felt like 80% of the game went on auto-pilot. For the majority of the game I was stuck with 2 steering cards with one movement. Which resulted in always playing the third card I kept on getting. Maybe fun for kids, but not for me. We didn't add any more stuff from B board tiles, since those seemed to bring nothing but more randomness, not more options, strategy or tactics. Unfortunately it's a letdown, game had potential.

The game works, but I am not the target audience. While an adult can play it, this is really for kids that want to smash Gi Joe guys around on the floor of their room. The repetitive action and samey card effects just drag for anyone over the age of 13.

It is a step up from roll and move at the very least.

RATING: 6.5
Mario Kart in board game form.  If you like the feel and play style of Mario Kart, I'm pretty sure that you will like this game.  The number of map tiles and customization allows for tons of track designs.  You can make them as complex or as simple as you want.  Buy two base games for endless track options!  The characters are loosely based on those from the classic Hannah Barbara cartoon "Wacky Races".  A fun little racing game with a twist.

My only real complaint about this game has to be the player tokens.  With so much care and thought seemingly put into all the rest of the components, the player tokens are just simple colored cars.  They aren't very imaginative or thematic to the game.  It would have been nice to see them at least look different for the different characters or something.  I have seen people customize their games with their own player tokens (most notably actual Mario Kart ones, lol) but finding anything in the correct scale is next to impossible,

Good game for kids and adults. Mario Cart board game basically. The main issue I have with the game is a LOT of information seems omitted from the rulebook. There is a "judges ruler" in the box but no mention of how to employ it. The back page mentions a "championship" mode but directs you to the Redglove website which only has this in Italian (sadly, I am unilingual). Many of the forums mention playing 2-players with "bots" but the base rule book says nothing about it. I still enjoy the game but it leaves a lot to interpretation/judgement

I put 10 because someone put 1 and this game isnt bad it's really funny... if you want something harder to play give away!

Edit...
Removed the 1... this is my real vote.
Now i've played more that 10 races, in 2 with 2 bots, in 3 with 1 bot, and in 4... everytime great!
Now i'm waiting for some expansions...

Mario Kart: The Boardgame. I suppose in a way it does succeed in transferring the video game to the tabletop because it feels somewhat similar to its paragon when played by unskilled players: luck-driven and mostly arbitrary. You cannot even change lanes unless you get the proper card in your three-card hand.

Maybe it is designed for kids, but hardly can kids remember all of the rules. The game plays itself. There are little or no options in a turn: cards do all the same thing, every turn and you cannot even choose whether to activate card's ability before or after the movement. There's really a lack of creativity in this game.

Sur un circuit à la Formule Dé en plus simple, vous avez une voiture avec des petites capacités spéciales. Vous pouvez balancer des bombes et des missiles à vos adversaires, via les cartes de déplacement/tir. Une petite mécanique fait que les voitures "respawnent" quand elles son détruites et une autre fait qu'on est jamais complètement à la ramasse.
Mais c'est drôle les dix premières minutes. Après, on s'est emmerdés comme des rats morts.

It's a really inexpensive and simple clone of Mario Kart as a board game.

It does have a modular board, card based movement (thankfully not dice), and a few other decent things going for it, but the production values are low.  I can't recommend for anything but young gamers, maybe 10-13 years old.

RATING: 7
Un Fórmula D para niños que gusta (y mucho) también a los adultos. 
Buena calidad de materiales, una estética bonita, 6 coches con habilidades diferentes para elegir, 12 losas con dibujos por ambas caras que permiten la creación de circuitos por parte de los jugadores. La cara A representa el modo "fácil" y la B el modo "difícil". Pueden combinarse como se quieran, lo que le aporta una rejugabilidad elevada.
Partidas cortas pero emocionantes y siempre divertidas con constantes cambios de posiciones.
Una mezcla entre Fórmula D y Mario Kart que hace las delicias de toda la familia. Muy recomendable.
Además incluye una figura de volcán, fichas de nitro, una figura de puente elevado y la posibilidad de hacer campeonatos a partir de la descarga de archivos desde la página oficial del juego.


Nota:
El poder especial de Nivel III (3 estrellas) de algunos coches (rojo, amarillo, blanco y negro) permite avanzar 8 o 10 casillas de golpe, lo que puede suponer una gran ventaja respecto al resto de coches (rojo, azul).

Por las partidas jugadas, hay una clara tendencia a que los coches azul y rojo lo tengan bastante más difícil para ganar una carrera debido precisamente a esa debilidad en su poder especial de nivel 3. 
Y es que poder avanzar 8/10 casillas de una sola vez además del movimiento que otorga la carta es algo muy difícil de contrarrestar, por tanto...

Si se juega con niños, éstos pueden coger los coches con el poder especial más poderoso mientras que los adultos los otros coches, en principio, más débiles.
Si la partida es a 2 jugadores adultos, a menos que uno quiera probar a hacer una machada o una carrera épica contra los elementos, se recomienda que los 2 coches o bien sean la pareja azul+rojo o bien cualquier combinación de los otros 4 colores. Mezclar un coche fuerte con  uno débil puede suponer un paseo fácil para el jugador que esté en las manos de uno de los coches más fuertes.

This is basically Super Mario Kart in board game form.  There are two sets of cards that you'll get depending on your placement during the race.  Red cards are more powerful but are reserved for those at the back of the pack.  Green cards don't advance racers as far as red but are for those cars doing well in the race.  It can get a little tedious if those playing aren't buying into the theme.  I played with two others.  Before I sat down to the table, I watched a game of five.  I'd think that's too many people, thus creating too much downtime in a game that focuses on speed.

People will call this Mario Kart: The Board Game.  Is that their sales pitch or their shorthand?  Doesn't matter--the description is pretty spot on.  Either you'll play Mario Kart or you won't.  That should tell you everything you need to know about playing this game.

RATING: 7
Un Mario Kart da tavolo, altissima interazione con gli altri giocatori, ci si fa letteralmente a pezzi per cercare di guadagnare posizioni sul tracciato, il movimento e le armi vengono eseguite tramite delle carte azione che, in pieno stile degli analoghi videogiochi, sono più potenti tanto più si è indietro nelle posizioni. Ogni giocatore ha inoltre il proprio personaggio con delle abilità personalizzate ed esclusive.
Unica pecca è l'accanimento su un giocatore che può portarlo ad una retrocessione estrema sul tracciato (Quando si muove si arretra al primo checkpoint)
Molto adatto ai neofiti

Don't go into this game expecting a lot of strategy or tactics.  It's more of an "experience" game, which means the fun is derived from things that happen during the game instead of big decisions you are making.  If you can't stand any "take that", a little luck, or light gameplay, stay away.  If you're looking for a quick game that will offer some laughs, then this might fit the bill.

It does feel a bit like Mario Kart and the gameplay is very straightforward.  On your turn, you pick a card from your hand.  Activate the ability on the top and then move the # of spaces listed on the bottom of the card.  You only have a small hand of 3 cards, but does offer a bit of hand management.  You'll be launching rockets at your opponents, dropping bombs, boosting special abilities all while trying to avoid obstacles in your path.

Nice race game with the same flavour of Super Mario Kart.
It can be a little bit boring if it becomes too long - and this can happen depending on the boards. 
If it goes up to 8 players and gets more cards, it can go up to 7. 

EDIT: With the exp it became more interesting and the 8p limit is really good for me because we are often more then 6. Then 6.5 -> 7

Board game version of a kart race? Customizable? Chaotic? Modular? Hell yes! This game is a grandious show of fun, with bombs, unexpected turns and most games end up head-to-head, while still not being (too) frustrating for the loosers. 

If I had to make one criticism is that some tiles make the game drag on for a little too long while players grind their way through them. But then again, you are free to just leave them out!

El circuito base es "hasta 10-11 años", por eso si bien la partida fue corta, se me hizo larga. Tiene restricciones a las opciones que no eran necesarias. El mecanismo de emparejar (catch-up) es demasiado fuerte, al punto que es tan difícil salir último como salir primero.

De todos modos, ni bien descubrí que había un reverso en los tiles con circuitos más complejos me picó la curiosidad y estaría más que dispuesto a probarlo, porque en verdad, plasma muy bien la temática propuesta.

This is supposed to be a board game version of Mario Kart essentially - and to do that it needed to play fast and be hectic...and it pulls it off! Plays well with all numbers but playing with 4+ (by adding bots if necessary) makes it nice and wild. Powers. Rockets. Boulders. Boosts. It is all here with tremendous variety of tracks and special track features. Great fun and fast.

Great to play with kids.  My first thought when seeing and playing it was not Mario Kart but Wacky Racers.  Has good replay-ability due to many configurations to be formed and extras to add in.  We always (over a dozen plays so far) get a laugh out of what happens in the game - ways cars get sent back, boosts, quirky combinations, etc.

It is exactly what you expect it to be. If you want a light goofy wacky racers Mario Cart game this is it. 

If you only want a strategic Euro there are tons of other options, this isn't worth your time. I thought it was good fun, but a little imbalanced. The nitro in the expansion helps  to make up for characters that have better special powers. 7.5 with the expansion.

Looove this. Fast and ridiculous and usually very close. The catch-up mechanics are good but not frustrating. Setting off chain reactions (bombs, pushing cars, etc) is really fun.

In 2015 they publish a game that absolutely lacks of creativity.

You have 3 almost identical cards and every turn you play one of them. Sometimes you throw a die. Basically you have minimal control over the gameplay.

Estremely chaotic and unpredictable, occasionally very funny with roars of laughter. I would suggest no more than two laps because really the 80% of the race is just random bashing. Depth zero, you just need to play it for what it is, blindly dealing hits to opponents until someone manages unknowingly to cut the finish line.
Very good with kids, unless they can't stand being bashed.

Finalmente provato qualche partita durante le vacanze natalizie. Ho provato il circuito base con circa tre partite per limare il regolamento. Anche questo gioco si presta a gruppi numerosi,molto meno divertimento in "soli" due giocatori. Molto carino.

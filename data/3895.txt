Splendid game. Beautiful miniatures. Combat mechanic still amazes me. I prefer 1st ed ship designs with 2nd ed critical hits. The medium and large fighters feel like battleships in terms of damage they can hold. Since movement is simple, it's easy to control up to 10 ships per player. The (2nd ed) rules for light capital ships are interesting, but I guess the basic system don't support it's addition ver well.

A good tabletop strategy game, best played as a series of small dogfights rather than a large space armada. Good damage control system. However, I still prefer 'Full Thrust' overall.

Great fast play starfighter combat!  Initiative leaves something to be desired, but house rules can fix that.  Lots of supplements.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Tactical individual ship (small fighters) minatures game. Best bit is you roll one set of dice to 'hit' and if successful read the same roll for damage, making it quite fast. Problem is initiative is crucial (like many air combat games) and there's no 3rd dimension at all. Played a fair bit in the early 90's, even painted some of the figures. Now it's gathering dust.

Among the better space combat games and one of the better games for playing with more than 8 people... but still awfully darn long, with little promise of engaging you.

Excellent Game (always want to play it).

Absolutely Brilliant one-roll mechanics for lightning fast and smooth sci-fi play! 

ICE is ridiculed for Rolemaster as being complicated and I think a lot of people missed this great game. These kind of mechanics could be used in so many other ways!

If only the ship construction system was consistent and balanced this would be a true "10", Still I'll Always want to play this one.

Try to mix in some heavy and light ships for a more interesting battle.  Too many light maneuverable ships make the game very dull: "I move behind your ship and shoot... now you move behind my ship and shoot... repeat as necessary."  While not the best space combat game I've played, it has enough variety to make it interesting.

ok space combat game.  Didn't really strike me as great.  All is at the mercy of the roll of the dice which is ok but I am more of a strategy type game player - although I suck at them too.

Ultimately, it gets weaker with every expansion you add, but the basic engine is very slick and a lot of fun to play.  There are some quirks (such as the fact that higher defense value ships will normally suffer more damage when hit), but if you view it with a beer and pretzels attitude, they shouldn't bother you too much.  Still play it every year at conventions, just to stay in practice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of my favorite space dogfighting games. The damage track is what attracted me to this game. The sensation of trying to hold my battered starfighter together while trying to maneuver into a good firing position puts me right into the middle of the action like any good sci-fi space movie would. Playing time depends on number of ships involved. Rules range from simple to more time-consuming if the optional advanced rules and gear are used.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Exceptionally easy-to-learn and fun space fighter simulation game.  Played this tons and tons of times with friends just getting introduced to this style.  Big black cloth starmaps, lots of dice, beautifully designed fighters, and quick play made this game truly awesome!

For a simple game there is more complexity than is needed.  Silent Death was a spin-off of the Star Strike space combat system for the Space Master RPG.  It was simplified but much of the good core mechanics and ship construction was lost.  Then unnecessary complexity was glopped on top of the system in the various expansion books.  I still like the game, but it could have been so much better.

There is a lot I like about this game, the combat system is awesome and streamlined in a very nice fashion; lots of flexibility, but at the same time doesn't require 20 dice throws to determine whether you hit and how much damage you did. However the movement rules didn't quite stick with me and whoever goes first will definitely be blown to tiny little bits. This could have been prevented with a 1-turn ahead move plotter or something like that, although I guess that would remove from the fast pace of the game.

Great fast space game. Original way for the "hit" and "damaga" rolls: you rolls only one time, and the dices tells you if you hits and how much damage.
I own the "metal express" version, with some ugly (IMHO) metallic ships miniatures, and not so bad looking cardboard ships counters. The maps are in a gloss thin paper, but counters are very strong: i drop a full glass of water on my counters, and you can't see what was wet and what was safes...
A friend buy the new version, with beutiful plastic miniatures, and very beautiful PAPER counters, but the counters are now very thin, and he must glue it on strong cardboard by hands.

I loved Silent Death when I was younger.

RATING: 6
A light, enjoyable game of 2D space combat. It has two features I really like. One is the combined die roll that resolves both whether a shot hits or not and how much damage it does, as well as wrapping the gunner's skill into the mix. The second is the damage track, which shows the incremental deterioration of the ship under fire.

Later supplements unnecessarily complicated a game that was at its best when kept simple.

I like the Beer and Pretzels side of this game. Easy to learn, fun to play, and relatively fast though if you want realism go elsewhere. Complaints are I'd like the Houses to have more originality in them rather than using the same old basic fighters. The later House modules were starting to address this but sadly too late with ICE dying at the time. With the Grubs (dark killing aliens) versus the Ulunkalukla (Hawaiians in Space) the background needs to be revamped BADLY. I just couldn't have cared less about the background. This game is in LIMBO since MageKnight owns the rights to this game with ICE trying to get something worked out.

RATING: 10
Easy to learn rules but with some nice depth.  In particular, some really clever thinking went into the streamlining of the combat rules, giving some impressively detailed combat results with a minimum of dice rolls.  Plays fast, but you can add on as many of their offered optional rules as you wish to complicate things up nicely.  

Probably one of the BEST starfighter combat games out there.  For me, it's always felt very "Star Warsy" in its 2-D presentation of starfighters streaking around at full throttle with weapons blazing and with pilots desperately wrenching at their controls in a vain attempt to twist out of the way of that incoming flight of torpedoes.  

And where it differs from Star Wars in its importance placed on torpedoes and missiles, it makes up for it in sheer variety of ships from which to pick.  There are so many sourcebooks available for this game full of more and more fighters and even some smaller not-quite-capital sized ships, that it can be hard to keep track of them all.

Great game.

RATING: 8
First time out we played with half of the rules for simplicity's sake and the game sucked!

Second time out we played with all of the rules (even some optional ones) and Silent Death kicked butt!!!  

I'm a Star Fleet Battles die hard and I really like this game!  Sometimes less is more!

A lot of fiddle that bares no resemblance to actual space combat and little richness in tactical options.

Fun game in space. Great for large groups, with a varied and wide selection of ships and fighters. Assuming the new owners get their butts in gear, we should be seeing more good stuff.

A classic game with tons of replay value and a very novel dice mechanic system - your "attack" roll also determines your damage, whic speeds things up dramatically. A huge variety of ship designs, and a very cool integrated damage track, so as you cross off ship damage, your ship slowly degrades or critical hits occur. Great rules for both one-shot battles or campaigns. Way ahead of its time, and worth digging up to play.

THE space fighter game. I used to take this to conventions and run it. I had no problem introducing to novice players.

No one can hear you scream in space.

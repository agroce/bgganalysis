RATING: 8
Initial Impression: Richard Borg has done it again by modifying the C&C system with just enough tweaks to make the system feel unique to the WWI theme. In particular, the tactics cards, offboard artillery bombardment, and trench runs really add to the flavor of the game without adding to the rules overhead. My one gripe with this package is with the production values. In particular, the miniatures are so small as to be difficult to discern from across the board. Memoir-sized minis would probably have been a better choice. Similarly, space on the cards was not optimized and there's alot of blank space which could have been better used to increase the font-size for the text. Those gripes aside, not being particularly interested in WWI, I feel that if anything will fan the flames of interest in this conflict it will most likely be this game.

Update after multi session play and another upgrade after I played the game solo now WITH the boardgame on the table AND the AI coming from my Surface 4 !!!

But helas the AI is beatable even on hard difficulty. Still fun trying to win with the less losses possible...

Great game as I never thought the C&C system could be applied to trench warfare. Actually this game is the first historical correct wargame of the series. 

The extended system and chrome work this time. Since WW1 has almost always the same kind of battlefields in the West the trench maps portray WW1 warfare in an incredible accurate way.

Add the extra combat cards with COUNTER play on the other side's turn and the uncertainty always reigns in this game along with the protection cover in trenches.

Artillery is massive ... and mostly ineffective... MG fire can be deadly ... HQ resources are ALWAYS needed but you will see, you will run out of them before you know...

Memoir 44 was made a different and better game with the Breakthrough rules and certainly in the D Day Landings, my feeling is that the Great War is already excellent with the basic box.

Comparing the historical C&C systems I now put Ancients first ... because that period is on top for hampered Command and Communication problems in warfare. Followed by both TGW and The Napoleonic era. Battle Cry is the least developped while indeed basic Memoir 44 shows that WW2 was never really suited to have any simulation value.

I doubled down on the Kickstarter. Richard Borg is the only designer that could induce me to give that avenue a try. 

Update 7/22: Early reviews are positive, some saying that this game matches very well with their understanding of tactical trench warfare in the First World War. I've long said that the C&C system is at its best recreating linear battles. And battles are not much more linear than tactical trench battles of the Western Front during the First World War!

Update 8/4: Played through the introductory scenario as the Germans. My opponent as the British gamely "went over the top" and tried an assault. As the out-numbered Germans I largely shot back. In a second game as the British, it took some effort to create a weaker point in the enemy trench line. Then I committed to broad-front attack so that sheer mass and proximity would overwhelm at least one of the sections.

Attacking is very difficult and you'll need to take advantage of every piece of terrain the scenario and shell craters that Reserve Arty strikes give you to get across No Man's land. And don't forget the Combat cards. The great majority only cost 1 or 2 HQ tokens and many will help you get a needed edge when you're making that fateful crossing. Get that hand of cards built up! 

Great fun, but I need to play more!

Interesting iteration of the Comamnd and Colors/Memoir system. The way terrain (trenches/craters/wire) is modeled, along with combat dice and artillery, gives this a distinct period feel. Rushing no man's land feels as thrilling and risky as it should, and the scenarios do a great job propelling you into treacherous and climactic assaults. Overall, this is a great game with tactical nuances and solid drama.

I love miniatures, so I bought this game for its 3D aspect.  Unfortunately, compared to serious WWI boardgames, it does not play like WWI battles.  The sides are too close in size for the attacker to survive.  The flavor of the game comes randomly to both sides in cards.  Those abilities should be a function of the side, the year, and the situation.  The scenarios are very similar.  To win, the attacker must concentrate in one area and overwhelm the defenders there, but the C&C system spreads out your actions across three sectors, preventing such a concentration.  No flamethrowers, no gas, all units are identical quality.  Rules easy to learn. Should be interesting for non war gamers.

Played this for the first time tonight at the Aberdeen Wargames Club. Excellent game, and as the British I really felt the pressure of having to go 'over the top' to stop the Germans running away with the victory.
The pre-start bombardment is very good, opening up channels through the barbed wire and providing much needed craters which provided cover for my poor Tommies crossing No-Mans Land. The tactician cards really add to the whole gaming experience as well. The board has a green and a brown playing side - how very dismal the brown side looked....just right for creating the right atmosphere. I have to mention that the Plastic Soldier Company minis are my favourite so far for all of the Borg games I've played - different poses for infantry, and full teams for mortars and machine gunners - the attention to detail is excellent.
Looking forward to the rest of the scenarios....and then there is the Tank expansion and I hear there are proposals for future releases for other Nationalities --Russians, French.... I've played a few of the Borg variations (Napoleonics, Battle Cry, Memoir 44) and I like them all. Just Ancients and Battlelore to go........but so many scenarios....so many add ons and double board games.........

Good game. Evolves nice and smoothly. Takes a bit before you can play without having to take a look to the rules booklet, but to be fair that happens with most games. So, nothing to worry about. 
Plays well solo if you randomise the enemy turns. That can easily be done by randomly extracting his command card and then playing as if it was your go. 
Played once with my wife (the wife test is the best one to know if a game is good for the no-geek friends) and she liked it. She actually pushed me to set up the next scenario. Is not that I expect her to become a big fan, but I know she will always be happy to play when I suggest a match.
Now played twice with wife. Wife test passed!!! Quite addictive little game. Simple rules, fun. Good!

Captures the feel of WWI trench warfare.  I love the Artillery mechanic, it is unique to this C&C game and very effective in finishing off wounded units that usually run away and can never be killed in other variants.  The 'Lore' system of HQ points is done very well here.  It adds strategy without adding a lot of new rules.   Overall, a top notch addition to the C&C family.  Can't wait to play it more.

I've owned or played nearly all of the numerous iterations of the 'Command & Colours' system but have ended up being a bit underwhelmed by most of them. They have the advantage of being easy to get to the table and play in a couple of hours, but for me they often don't evoke the warfare they are trying to and the luck element is just too dominant in deciding the winner.

Having had this version explained to me at UK Expo I was hopeful that it might have managed to improve things but alas not. It does manage to represent WWI warfare better than 'Memoir 44' represents WWII but there are still issues and the luck is just the same - the luck of the dice compounds with the luck of the card draw.

In terms of 'capturing' the nature of WWI warfare the main glitch for me was the ease of tactical artillery - it was possible to call it down on virtually any turn in whichever sector you wanted - albeit with the chance of it straying from the exact hex aimed at. This just doesn't reflect the battle field comms of the period  and due to the lethality of leaving the trench resulted in dissolute shelling of wherever the enemy was concentrated most to try and inflict some hits whilst waiting for the right combo of cards to come into your hand to sprint across to the opposite trench. 

So nothing to see here that would draw me into playing this version of C&C again - I have sold all of the versions I owned with the exception of the Ancients, which I think the system was designed on and for which it works best.

More beer and pretzels silliness from the C&C line of games. This one has a nice wrinkle with bonus cards that can be used by spending the currency of HQ tokens. At the same time, however, your off-board artillery is ordered using HQ tokens. At the end of your turn, you have the choice of taking a bonus card or loading up on HQ tokens. Some reasonably nice decisions there. 

But since this is C&C, your battlefield decisions don’t matter as much as the cards and dice. It’s suicidal to leave your trench and run across No Man’s Land, so your best bet is to use off-board artillery to hopefully soften the enemy up and then go over the top. Your opponent will be doing the same thing, so you both sit there and roll dice to see whose arty hits first and then who has the cards to mount an attack. The dice take care of everything else. 

I’ve played Battle Cry, Memoir ’44, and Ancients, and the only one that I can take seriously is Ancients. The way you form and maintain your lines and make use of leaders while always having the “battle back” capability offer some reasonably compelling decisions. The others have little to do with any real battlefield tactics and are really just dressed up games of dice odds positioning. 

That said, I put this one somewhere between Ancients and the other games due to the HQ token element. I like the decisions there, and whereas I may not play this one for serious strategy, I can play it for a representation of the chaos and carnage that was WWI (I just won’t have much control over whether I’m dealing it or receiving it).

As to the components, I think it’s fairly obvious that going with PSC was a mistake. The British bayonets were notoriously problematic, but just the idea of having to clip and assemble figures for a game like this does not make sense; the extra value is nowhere near commensurate with the extra work required. 

While the bayonets were annoying, I’m also peeved at the KS bonus artillery sets. I assembled the guns and cleaned the crew figures only to learn that they sit off board and there’s no need for them to be in figure form whatsoever. They’re intended to replace the artillery chits that are simply much more practical and take up way less space.

Memoir 44 gameplay enhanced with tactic cards (like lore cards in Battlelore) plus rules tweaks for WWI flavour - added game play but also added rules overhead.

All the bits are very good (although I wish they had gone for the regular playing card size command cards rather than the skinny FFG ones) and the rules booklet is very well laid out.

The minis are very good although a little smaller and lighter than the Memoir minis but with some additional variety of poses and a very good level of detail. The hard plastic will make painting easier and more long lasting but, unfortunately the hard plastic is also a little more brittle so some issues have been reported getting the minis off the sprus.

The deeper board is great and also ready for epic play.

I have issues with this game.  This is a preliminary rating, but I've played a lot of C and C based games, so I think I have a pretty good feel for what is going on after only a few plays.  

On one hand, it is the C and C system, which is well established.  I actually think that the components are fine, as opposed to a lot of the other commenters.  I guess I just realized that it was a hard plastic and used my nippers that I use to cut out the Games Workshop minis.  It worked fine.  And the tanks are pretty amazing.  The board is nice, the cards are nice, the artwork is good.  Overall I like the presentation.  

On the other hand, the game is very, very thematic.  Too thematic, in fact.  You are entrenched most of the time and if you stay in the trenches you get a significant boost for your defense.  If you go "over the top" your guys get mowed down.  So there's almost no incentive to do anything other than sit in a trench and take pot shots.  I suspect that it would be more fun as a game if you had one soldier/flag mitigated at range and none at close combat, but, then again, I need to get more into the scenarios before I give it a final rating.

This is an excellent addition to the Command and Colours stable of games and may be my favourite of the bunch.  What stops me giving this a 9 is the quality of the hard plastic figures included.  The sculpting is fine, but the figures (being designed as wargames figures) are quite brittle and the sprue design for the British makes it nearly impossible to take them off the sprue without losing some bayonets.  PSC has acknowledged this as a problem and it sounds like they will correct it in future printings.

Just once I wish a C&C come would come out that didn't brilliantly tweak the game in subtle ways to totally capture the flavour of its setting. The Great War is not that game.

The terrain rules are excellent and simple, the difference between being in the open and being in a trench is absolutely huge,  just like it should be. The combat rules are great, ranged combat is iffy, close combat is very dangerous. Artillery is powerful but unreliable. Machine guns are terrifying. Everything feels just like it should for a WW1 setting.

The pre-game artillery barrage which creates gaps in the wire is a very neat touch, and adds some variability to scenario set up which means they'll play out differently each time.

Lore, ahem, Combat Cards are also lots of fun, and allow lots of additional scope for strategic planning beyond what is offered by the Command Cards.

The scenarios I've played so far seem pretty balanced too, which is a decent feat considering the attack/defence asymmetry. It's a shame there isn't a bit more variety, but that isn't realistic given the theme really.

I wish the rulebook had a few more examples in it, there's plenty of white space where they could have gone and people who haven't played a C&C game before could probably benefit from a bit of assistance with LOS etc.

There are some other minor quibbles too trivial to bother typing, but overall this is yet another superb addition to the C&C family.

Richard Borg has once again done a magnificent job.

The overall feel is right between Battle Cry and Memoir 44, but with an interesting twist with MG units, mortar units, off-board (reserve) artillery units and reworked battle dice that interact with the terrain.  Interesting innovations are also included (HQ tokens and Combat Cards).

The MG units can combine fire (crossfire) and are very potent out to a range of three hexes.  The mortars are slightly less potent out that far, but have an extra hex of range, do not require a line of sight and can be used to clear wire.  Normal Infantry has declining firepower at range somewhat similar to Battle Cry and Memoir 44.  The reserve artillery units have unlimited range, do not need a line of sight and can clear wire, but have accuracy issues.  The accuracy system is based on a one hex drift possibility driven by dice that elegantly allow for critical hits in the target hex. 

The reworked battle dice interact with terrain differently than in the other C&C games. Essentially, terrain allows you to ignore flags and/or infantry symbol hits.  However, burst hits always count and skull hits always count in close combat (skull hits never count in ranged fire unless a Bomber figure is involved at a two hex range).   The net effect of all of this is that it is very dangerous to be in open ground.  It effectively increases your vulnerability to ranged fire by a factor of three versus being in a trench.


The Combat Card/HQ token system essentially moves the reaction cards and other special cards that have traditionally been in the main Command Card deck into a separate Combat Card deck.  Each player had a Combat Card hand in addition to a Command Card hand.  Combat Cards can be played by spending HQ tokens.  HQ tokens also fuel the use of the reserve artillery units.  The effect is that in gameplay you have to manage three drivers (Command Cards, Combat Cards and HQ tokens) rather than just one driver (just Command Cards).

The packaging of the Kickstarter copies of the game and the hard plastic British figure sprues have been problematic.

While the poor Kickstarter packaging is horrific, most reports seem to indicate that, while game boxes are dented in and the stretch goal scenario sheet wrinkled, the stretch goal artillery sprues are mostly coming through safely.  However, there have been some exceptions. 

With respect to the hard plastic figures, it is very important that they be very carefully cut off of their sprues using a good pair of sprue cutters from a hobby store.  An Xacto knife will also be needed to clean the flash off of the bottom of the base on each piece.  Finally, a small amount of plastic model glue will also be needed for the MG figures.

If you take your time, there is no real issue with cutting out the figures except with the bayonets on British figure sprues.  However, even that issue can be minimized by being careful. PSC is offering  a free replacement British figure sprue to Kickstarter backers who have broken British bayonets.  Note that broken bayonets can be glued back on to the figures with plastic model glue.  Due to the welding nature of plastic model glue (when working with hard plastic), once reattached, the bayonets are very sturdy.  To keep the figures safe, they should be kept in a hard plastic container like a Plano, not in the plastic baggies that come with the game.

The GOOD NEWS with the hard plastic pieces is that the detail on them is excellent and they are of a consistent scale.  Furthermore, once cut out, I found that they are very sturdy to handle.  Finally, even though they are a bit smaller and lighter than the soft plastic figures in Battle Cry and Memoir 44, I found in actual game play they were just as easy to handle as the plastic pieces in the latter two games.

The rest of the components to the game (i.e., the mapboard, terrain tiles and cards) are good to excellent in physical quality.

There have been some complaints about the thickness of the cards.  While they are thinner than in the other C&C games, I found them to be more elastic and easier to shuffle.  They are also air cushioned and appear to be more resistant to moisture (i.e., sweat).

The only other thing I will add is that the artwork for the certain terrain tiles could have been a bit clearer (e.g., on the forest tiles) or of better quality (e.g., on the hill tiles).  However, this is of small consequence.

Overall, this is a great addition to the C&C series of games.  The game play is more interesting than for Battle Cry and the Memoir 44 base game.   The complexity is about the same as C&C:Ancients and slightly less than C&C:Napoleonics.  All of the components are good to excellent in quality -- as well as sturdy -- once the hard plastic figures are successfully cut off the sprues and safely stored in a hard plastic container.

Update 11/21/2015: After four months and 10 scenarios I continue to be impressed. In particular, I am finding the Somme scenarios to be quite interesting with their greater variety of terrain, somewhat unusual trench configurations, high victory thresholds and additional ways to win (e.g., capture of mine crater hexes and the exit of units).  In a couple of these scenarios, it didn't seem at first that the British could win, but in the end they did as the Germans got worn down.  Nevertheless, it was very close.

Richard Borg isn't afraid to tack on complexity, but for whatever reason he just won't take the necessary step of making the scenarios balanced by giving the defender a reason to play for time.  Also, the tanks seem grossly overpowered.  Not really to my taste.

Comments apply to basic game only. I find that this game captures the feel of WW1 trench combat surprisingly well for such a "light" system. Attacking is really hard and needs careful timing, but the defender is also stretched and fully engaged throughout. The (mainly 1916) scenarios are probably slightly in favour of the defender, but less so as my opponent and I have improved our game understanding and appreciated the subtleties of card play.  Lots of replay value here...

Really like this C&C game. Terrain is easier to work with than Memoir 44 and the rules make sense. Artillery is fun to use as an off board unit. Tense game play that makes you think twice about coming out of the trenches. Cards are beautiful and nice quality. Figures do require some patience removing from sprues, but I like that they can all fit in a small plano box. Glad I own this and play it quite often.

UPDATE: 2/3/16 - I've been playing this solo and enjoying it quite well. I do a random command card for the other side and choose the best combat card possible. It's not a perfect solo game, but it's still fun. 

Could really use an expansion about now!

A great Command and Colors game system version of WWI.  I really love this as a brief break from my favorite game like this, Memoir 44.

The figures are OK, but I often prefer to use Airfix 1/72 figures for infantry.

I also bought the French expansion which I think will take are of the issues with the production value of the figures.

RATING: 5
08/05/17 Played half of one scenario. At that point the game owner and I had had enough. 

The game in general suffers from being *too* accurate to its period/theme. Alas, historical does not necessarily equal fun. World War One was known as a meat grinder and that's what this game is. Its attrition with a capitol A. The defender ensconced in his trench is king. So like in history, the war drug on and on, as making any attack was basically suicide. Now the game could have alleviated this monotony by including some 1914 (pre-trench warfare) and some late 1918 scenarios (when the Germans were on the ropes). But noooooo, they decided to go with the mid-war period where every battle looks almost like every other. Pffft!  I also found the wording of some of the cards, and rules obtuse and needlessly confusing. 

I was glad I got to try The Great War, but I really have no desire to ever play the base game again. Maybe, just maybe, I'll try again when they publish some 1914 scenarios, or some eastern front battles. Or if they add some "toys" (tanks, cavalry, gas attacks, flame throwers, stosstruppen, airplane strafing, etc.). Until then... pass! I think I've now played five of the Command & Colors line of games and this one is the runt. 

Side note: If I had been the owner who was forced to cut the brittle figurines off the plastic sprues I would have rated the game a 3.

RATING: 10
I've played the first 5 scenarios. I keep my rating of 10. First of all: this is the first war board game my wife decide to play. And she thinks it was a lot of fun. 

Well, seriously, TGW enhance the C&C experience I've had with M44. It takes the dynamics of Winter Wars expansion --all the difficulty of hitting the enemy and the Combat cards-- and add the HQ management to put the game play in a new level. The no-man's-land and the reserve artillery also contribute decisively to recreate the WW1.  

I was worried about the quality of the minis, but they look really awesome over the battlefield ! The bayonet-gate? Use a sprue cutter, some plastic cement and that's it.

I'm looking forward to the upcoming expansion: Tanks !

More C&C goodness delivered with a few subtle tweaks to evoke the period. Very nicely done. Otherwise it's the usual free wheeling battle system that you already know and love.

Much better than M44. Fundamentally gets the challenge of tactical WW1 challenges.

Very good, but I'm worried about imbalance as the attacker. More plays will tell.

UPDATE: This is a really great design. Which is surprising, considering the conflict. Would love a Middle East expansion.

Has dethroned "Ancients" as my favorite "Commands and Colors" title. I really like the way the C&C system works here. 

The "British bayonet" issue with the sprues is frustrating and unnecessary to be sure, but doesn't affect gameplay Don't let it dissuade you from checking out this game.

RATING: 5
A fairly simple and quick-playing 2-player tactical-strategy game using the Commands & Colors system adapted for WW1 trench combat.

I would rate this game quite a bit higher if it weren't for the rather poor production quality. Firstly, the plastic figures all come on sprues, so if you aren't ready for a bit of tedious work before you play, then STAY AWAY! Secondly, the British infantry have incredibly fragile bayonets, making it almost a certainty that you will lose a few as you painstakingly attempt to separate them from their sprues. Thirdly, the cards are pathetically thin and almost certainly require sleeving if you intend to shuffle them (or even handle them) normally. Fourthly, the rule book and cards are rife with spelling and grammar errors as well as extremely obtuse and awkward wording, making it more difficult to learn how to play the game than should be necessary (and no, I am not considering the British spellings).

Game has been sold due to aforementioned disappointments.

RATING: 8.5
I love WW1 war games and I have found this game very funny to play; at the moment my favourite in the command and colors series. Ok, it is not truly a WWI simulation like my preferred title Der Weltkrieg (SPW games), but it gives to me the tension of the attack preparation and the frantically defense with shells, infantry bullets and MG firing everywhere. The vote is about the system, after playing three time, but only the two introductive scenarios  After playing more scenarios I'm going to recheck my vote

[b]The Great War[/b] was sold via the marketplace 3/1/16.

[i]Total impulse buy and I really paid for it. First of all while the minis are beautiful they were very difficult to remove from the sprues without snapping off bayonets. That topic has been covered enough in various threads, but it is ridiculous that a plastic mini company dropped the ball when designing the molds for the sculpts. 

My biggest gripe with the game is that it plays out exactly like trench warfare should and that's really not fun. The game puts an artificial timer on one side to force them to be more aggressive and suffer a lot of casualties while trying to reach an objective. While historically accurate, but not as much fun as it's main competitor in my house Memoir 44. I much prefer the tactics you employ in Memoir and really don't need two of these games in our collection since they are both time intensive to set up and play (if you play each scenario twice).

What did I like? Well the reason I bought the game was for the added combat card mechanic similar to the magic cards in Battle Lore. I really like how these cards enhance your strategy and influence the tactics you may employ. I would love to see this system adopted to Memoir in an expansion, it seems totally viable and would add a lot to the game. I'm sure a lot of people will end up loving The Great War, it really depends on what your looking for in a light, tactical war game.[/i]

RATING: 7.5
Promising gameplay docked a point because of the irritating physical presentation.  No more cutting and/or assembling plastic figures for me.  It was a pain in the ass (though less so than Samurai Battles, a royal friggin' pain in the ass) and I'm done with it.  Rediscover counters, guys.  They work just fine with much less fussiness.

This delivers the best history of any game in the series so far.  That also means that play can be slow and frustrating till someone is ready to go over the top.  But give it a few plays before deciding it's not for you - the planning and anticipating the big push can be engrossing.  Definitely not as quick and clean a gaming experience as Memoir or Battle Cry, but rewarding in a mud and blood sort of way.

Another excellent implementation of the Commands & Colors system. It really encapsulates the feel of WWI combat without being the boring, drawn-out slugfest that much of the war was. You can charge and take on some serious casualties, sit back and bombard with long range artillery, and overall, it takes some skillful card play and a little luck to get the victory. I'm really enjoying this one.

This may well be the best C&C version yet and I have played them all.  The cards & conditions (ex. ignore 2 soldier rolls while in a trench) really suit the warfare of the period and give the game play a real sense of tension.
No more aimless running amok over the map; doing as much carnage as possible. Now, every move has to be weighed and considered. Crossing no-man's land too early will be suicidal.
My only complaint is that gas attacks are rather under powered and not subject to gusts of wind to change direction.  This could be corrected with an expansion/second printing.
Cavalry units would be a nice addition too, even before tanks.

Command & Colours Does a very credible version of the great war WWI. I normally shy away from the first world war as it was a brutal war of attrition, but interesting card choices, on top of the regular C&C Command selection gives meaningful choices that stops the game feeling as stagnant as the actual war was but still giving it a real flavour of the conflict

Having hundreds of small pieces to cut off of sprues ended up being too much of a barrier for me. Shame, since I was an excited Kickstarter backer. Memoir 44 is good enough for my collection.

After one play - not bad! Like Samurai Battles, I wish the "lore" cost requirements were a little more stringent, but having to balance between using cards and artillery is certainly interesting.

Tough, but very well done! I find the C&C system mixed with trench warfare SO interesting. The HQ tokens and cards are a bit like the lore in Battlelore, and that's no bad thing... Some of the command tactics cards are insanely powerful, but seem very appropriate for the setting (if devastating to be hit with).

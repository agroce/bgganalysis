:cry: :) :) :D :D Impressions from first play -- this is clearly a snowball economic. It's a fun train game, but the design choices leave a lot to be desired. There are cards with mistakes, and keeping track of income is a mess. Keeping track of events and economic conditions is also a mess if you're not sitting right on top of it. The cost connection printing is terribly tiny and hard to read, even if you're looking at it "right side up." The markers for income on special stuff are a hot mess. The (original) rule book is a disaster. 

I like the game, but it's got enough flaws that I can't rate it higher. This game might be "better," but Railways of the World is "cleaner." 

After doing this as a 10x10 in 2015, I had to downgrade it. There isn't much variability after a while. Supposedly some new cards are coming out to fix the imbalances.

A really interesting train game, and very different from other train games. However, there are several problems:

* Too many production problems (most annoying being the huge box).
* Lots of number crunching that needs recalculating every time the economic condition changes. 
* No way to catch a runaway leader except my least favourite one, targeted take-that action cards. 
* Lots of chrome and poor rules make the game hard to learn and teach. Once you understand it it plays smoothly, but there's quite a hurdle to get started.

A network building game in which the networks are built as in Power Grid.  Whereas Power Grid offers fixed pay-offs simply for connecting to a town, placing a depot in Rails earns you nothing unless you also own a business based in that town.  And here, I think lies one of the issues with Rails; it has a big map that is absolutely crammed with towns and potential routes between them.  There's hardly any competition for connections.  And because there's no competition, it's really difficult to pull back an opponent who takes a lead.  Hence, I think, the need for take that cards with which to relentlessly beat the leader.

On top of that, all of the decisions in this game felt quite obvious.  Which business shall I choose in this turn's draft?  How about the biggest earner that I can easily connect to?  Where shall I connect to?  Places where I own businesses.

To three hours of mild boredom add the irritations of a cluttered, poorly drawn map with text in a hard to read font.  Add the further irritations of an incomplete and ambiguous rule book.  This game feels under-cooked in all respects.

Euro mechanisms (particularly Power Grid style depot placement) meet a weak version of Silverton (no market manipulation, nor bidding for resources).

Maybe if players steal cards that they don't terribly need,

Why on earth is this ranked so low? Yes, the rulebook is crap and you are left to figure things out on your own, but the game itself is very engaging and really fun, not to mention thematically interesting from a historical perspective.

There are so many choices and paths to victory that the game seems totally open at the beginning. Should you go for hotels or mail routes? Or maybe take the capitals and set up a long network of trade? Or shoot for short-term goals? Is it better to take a business that prospers during a depression or during booms? Is it worth it investing in businesses with sheep? What about cities at risk for flood or fire? So many choices, lots of replayability.

Rails of New England sees you as an industrial magnate, establishing businesses and building railroads to connect them to major market cities. You start the game with one depot and a couple of unconnected businesses. You'll build new businesses and new depots, claim mail routes and passenger routes, all with the goal of having the most money at the end of the game.

likely a reimagining of silverton in the NE. there is a lot to like about this economic game, but a horrible graphic presentation, which likely adds an extra hour of play time to novice players, couple with a rules set that leaves plenty of room for questioning (adding extra time for novice players) means a game that is likely a 7.5 or maybe higher is a 5.5 due to extended play time and uncertainty of how to play.

hence i think i like the game, which this is suppose to be, it' just i'm not sure i'm playing that game.

In 1996, this would have been mildly hot stuff. In 2011, it is decidedly "meh". 

Except for the small group of people that love this exact sort of thing...too procedural, insanely fiddly, almost all decisions pretty obvious (ROI FTW). And then, you add the semi-random screwage and take-that card play. Whee.  :/

The quality, design choices, and physical production don't help.

Medium-heavy complexity economic euro. Each person starts as a rail company starting from a different New England state capitol and build businesses across New England while attempting to connect them to the market cities of Montreal, Boston and New York to increase the revenues.  Economic cycles vary, but can be prepared for in a limited fashion as some industries are more resistant to bad economic cycles.

(03/18/2011) Comment based on 1 play.

I would consider this the next "Silverton". I've played Silverton once prior, and while it was interesting, it was quite fiddly and random compared to Rails of New England. The RoNE mechanics of how the economy goes through boom-and-bust cycles is brilliant, where the economics of Silverton feels more like playing Yahtzee, while RoNE comes across far more sophisticated--it is clear that the designers put a lot of thought into the economics model of this game. Different businesses garner different levels of income depending on the cycle, and it is possible to anticipate through indicators on turn cards if the next several turns will be a time of prosperity or depression; this economic shift occurs gradually, so that players can prepare accordingly. 

While comparisons have been made to Power Grid, where players build nodes instead of track, there is definitely a "train" feel; players race to build depots at strategic nodes through the cheapest routes, and to potentially lock out other players from key cities. There is no pick-up and deliver, but rather players collect variable income from the businesses they have bought, depending on if a depot services the city where the business is based. There is also a sequence of random, yet historically based events that can affect economics and building, but these too are laid out ahead of time, with enough time to prepare; it is very unlikely to be blindsided like in other games that employ random events, such as in Empire Builder.

The components were fair, but I expected more from Rio Grande Games. The board fold and die-cut counters are reminiscent of classic Avalon Hill (think Squad Leader quality), and while the graphics are nice, the stylized text is small and hard to read. The rules were somewhat confusing, and we struggled through them the first several times. After checking the rules forums on BGG, it became clear that there were a number of issues that we didn't catch. There were several bits whose use were not explained in the rules, but we managed anyway. Although the game has been slammed for the "poor" rules, once they are ironed out, it is quite pleasant to play and packs a lot of brain-melty goodness that plays in about 3 to 4 hours. The first few times may be longer due to lack of familiarity with New England geography. Several other 18XX veterans have commented that this is a pretty good train game, and we are all open to playing it again. I rate this an '8', as I am willing to overlook the rules and see the game for what it is.

(05/08/2016) Update after 4 plays.

It has been five years since my third play, and possibly for good reason: the game is clunky and the rules are a mess. Even with the rules rewrite that is now available on BGG, relearning the rules after many years was a confusing and frustrating affair. Once play got underway, however, it was a enjoyable experience, much more like a network building game of Power Grid or Thurn and Taxi, than a train game. The asymmetrical starting positions and development of each of the players' networks were fascinating to watch unfold. Still, it bothered me that the game is rather unforgiving--a mistake or two resulting in a lost action can result in lagging far behind fairly quickly. The game seems to suffer from a runaway leader problem--once a player has a slight edge on income, he/she can get better businesses and build more routes, resulting in more income and so on. The winner of this game was apparent, in my mind, at about the halfway point. There was really no way to reign him in, other than hope a random event would knock him down. Perhaps it was because the group decided to not play with the various "take that" cards that are available in the card draws? Maybe those cards are necessary, like the calamity cards in Civilization or Age of Renaissance, to keep the leader in check? Still holding at a solid "8", but the long play time may keep this game from coming back to the table anytime soon.

Interesting connection game with an economic mechanic borrowed from "McMulti" (aka "Crude: The Oil Game") and connection mechanic borrowed from "Power Grid".

However my biggest problem is the "event" mechanic which is semi-borrowed from "Empire Builder" that can just really swing the game by unevenly punishing only certain player(s).  The other problem I found is it gets cumbersome to compute your income each round... having up to 10 businesses (period C, 8 otherwise) each which has 6 states (depending on whether it's connected to your network or not, and then 1 of 3 economic environments), then mail routes and special route income as well as sheep income (period A) and extra income for being connected to 1 or 2 extra major cities... I usually did the math twice just to make sure I had it right (except when nothing changed between rounds which is rare).

You have cards in hand that list businesses and the cities that they are in. In each round you have a chance to select one more business. You can play the cards face up to activate the business. To get higher income the business needs to be connected to a major city. Pay for a route to connect to your nearest depot and add a depot to the new city. There are also other types of cards that give bonuses for additional routes. It is nice having the cards in your hand so you can plan your best route. I really enjoyed this game.

RATING: 6
A railroad game for thematic gamers? The number of ratings and the rating itself show that there's only small overlap between railroad fans and thematic gaming. Most of the guys at our boardgame meetup are more on the Ameritrash side of gaming and weren't interested in playing this on theme alone. Actually, they might have liked it better than they expected while us Eurogamers were at least partially disappointed.
In first place, there's a lot of luck what cards you are dealt in the beginning and what is drawn each round. Experience will help to weather parts of it but some gamers will get a headstart in this economic snowball simply by getting better cards. To compensate for this, there are action cards which allow to target other players directly. Balancing by negative player interaction is not exactly my favourite gaming element. I don't enjoy the obvious tactic of not getting ahead of the pack to avoid the target cross on your forehead. The bad thing is that Rails of New England needs this element as otherwise the game could be decided early on. The rich get richer here if nobody does something against it.
Nonetheless, I enjoyed this game at least partially. It succeeds in creating an experience as you really get the feeling that you are building up a railroad network. Each player has a unique position from where to develop a basic strategy and implement it tactically based on specific business opportunities. Many small elements like the subventions for building something specific or events give enough flavour for players who want a story in their games and who don't care for clever mechanisms or negative interaction. While I occasionally enjoy a thematic game, the player targetting is too severe without any compensating benefits. I rather play Silverton which can be unfair and punishing as well but I prefer being beaten by the game system randomly than on the merit of being too successful.

Decent effort but a bit too long. Elements of Power Grid and Silverton. Compensation track too fiddly - you end up recalculating the three payouts most of the time anyway. Spent a lot of time trying to locate the various towns on the map - it begs for a grid and associated town index.

I'm giving it a 6 based on the solo play (which is not officially supported, so it's not very fair). Silverton seems the much better game, with some interesting decisions of when to sell and which resources to go for.

Here you automatically get a business, it's just that building depots there and to some market cities gives you extra income. Also the income depends on the market situation (depression, normal, or prosperity) but it doesn't vary nearly as much as Silverton and you don't have any control over it either.

I'm curious to try it with other players and see if my opinion of this improves.

Pleasantly surprised. I thought the events would ruin it for me, and that the core mechanics of building depots and buying businesses would be a bit too flat to make the game worth the time investment. Instead, the core mechanics seem fairly solid, and the events, along with the special routes, subsidies, and mail contracts, add some needed flavor to the game to keep things interesting. However, I do find that the action cards are an unwanted distraction. Most of them are take-that, and if you go with the optional "friendly" rules in the rulebook and remove the take-that cards, the action cards you're left with don't really add anything to the game. So IMO, it is better to just play without any action cards whatsoever.

For many, "train" games (placing track, pick-up & move, stock, etc.) can be a love/hate experience, but given that, for the most part train games are generally well done (especially ones based on the same mechanics).

I like the general premise and structure of the game, and it's cool that the five states each play differently, but there comes a point at which the flaws become impossible to ignore.  Lots of economic depression can make Rhode Island a runaway leader, Vermont is too susceptible to harmful events, and situations in which no useful actions can be taken are too common.

"Economic/route-building game that isn't as much like Empire Builder, Silverton, or Power Grid as you might be led to believe.  I had hoped to solo it (as I do with Crayon Rails games), but the swingy economic conditions prevent meaningful comparisons of high scores from game to game."

What I like:
- Meaty economic game
- Routes are fun (and not too much blocking)
- There are several different income sources

What I don't like:
- Late-game businesses are not way better than early-game
- Re-computing income is tedious (even if you use the trackers)
- The pointlessly-huge box isn't helped by a mediocre insert
- Rulebook left some important things out
- Is probably going to take longer to play than it deserves

I've only played two solo learning run-throughs so far. I would put the weight around 2.9, lighter than BGG voters.

RATING: 7
Rails of New England is a connection game in which players are trying to maximize the income from their various business cards by connecting them to major cities. Cities are connected a little like Power Grid--buying a depot in a city costs the connection cost from your closest depot, plus the cost of the depot. Multiple depots can be built at once, but depots beyond the first greatly increase in cost. Once the city specified by the business card and a major city have your depots, the income provided by that card will increase. Each card lists three levels of income, depending on the economic state. The economic state is determined randomly, but is visible three turns in advance so that players can plan. There is also a queue of events that can occur; most events are triggered by a die roll. Like the economy, events are available to be seen far in advance so that players can plan for them. However, many of these events effect some players more than others because of where they are geographically, in some cases there's really not much that can be done. I really liked what the game was trying to do in general, but I was frustrated by some of the specifics, namely the events, the take-that cards, and generally the random availability of business cards each round.

This is a decent game.  There are so many ways of making money, but nothing is overly complex.  The only two problems that I found with the game that made it long were calculating incomes every turn (use a calculator!) and deciding which businesses to buy (geography takes a bit of getting used to, but with four players, finding locations goes pretty quick).  Also, a cool aspect in the game was that each player has a different starting location which gives each player a different focus.  I really enjoyed my first play and would rate it a 9, but -1 (for game length, it took 4 hours to learn the rules and play).  If we can get this game down to 2.5-3hrs, the rating will go up.

This is a train game that looks like it's been merged with Power Grid.  There are some cool elements, such as the businesses and how you make connections, but it also has its fair share of shortcomings.  The greatest problem is that it seems to run longer than it should.  There seems like there should be a few less turns, mainly because when it appears as if the game might end due to cards being bought, it can bring the game to a screeching halt.  The business cards also have some SUPER POWERFUL actions mixed in, which if you get hammered with a couple of times can just ruin the game for you.  I did like the fact that it differed from Railways of the World because there didn't seem like there was one AWESOME place to start like on the USA map of RotW.  I also liked how the events and market came out.  I wanted to rate it higher, but I just can't based on its warts.

Необычные железные дороги. Если не учитывать, немного превышающую норму, количество пересчетов в партии, игра вполне оправдала ожидания. Чего не скажешь о качестве... Более отвратительно сделанной буржуйской игры (тем более от RGG) я не встречал. Правила написаны с ужасным количеством опечаток, сырые, целые таблицы в них неточны. Вообще, создается впечатления, что вложенные правила это какой-то промежуточный рабочий вариант авторов. Эргономика коробки отвратительна - сама огромная, а компонентов не то, чтобы много, но поле меньше размера коробки почти в 2 раза, из-за чего юзает внутри и царапается. Игровое поле бракованное по швам. При этом величина самого поля напрашивается быть крупнее - названия городов с трудом читаются, а они в игре главное. На 9(!) картах значимые опечатки. На поле также есть косяки. В игре не хватает дополнительных компонентов (на картах и поле специальных помет), облегчающих подсчеты, напоминалок и прочих второстепенных полезных утилит, помогающих не держать в голове в течении партии море детализированной информации.

A real mess! Too much going on a lot to think about and the game doesn't help: the board isn't clear on almost anything, cards are equal on their backs when they were supposed to look differently, rules are even worse than unclear.

Some good ideas with the deals and the market changes but that's all. A very solid idea and design that didn't work IMO because it wasn't tested enough and mainly because the production doesn't help the game play like it should. It is really a shame when this happens because designers aren't the owners of this kind of responsability.

However, minus points for Rio Grande. The rule book is poor (incomplete as far as I can see), the board is made of poor stock, needs to be bigger ,graphically looks like a prototype and is another beige mess that is so not helpful for colour blind gamers.

Despite the production problems it's top of my want to play list

One play and worried. The board is a mess, makes the game extremely difficult to play as the towns are unreadable from across the board - spent 30% of the game trying to find the location of businesses.

Plus worries about run way leader - if you get lucky with card draw then its cheaper to buuild a network and your income is larger. The cards are a clunky catchup mechanism.

Otherwise like the ideas - need to play again with more than 2 , preferably 4.

Very enjoyable economic game in which you try to have the greatest net worth by investing in successful businesses. There are several ambiguities in the rules but the designer seems to be answering questions here on BGG.  Warning:  Expect a long play time the first go around (there is a lot going on in the game and we were pretty unfamiliar with New England geography to know where all the cities were), ours was ~6 hours for a 5 player game.  The rules as written in the box are not the greatest and the components are kind of weak considering if it's from Rio Grande.

Enjoyable fairly lengthy economic & network-building game. First 4-player game inevitably started slowly as we got to grips with the rules. Subsequent turns accelerated as we understood the economic system & the various assets we could target.

Four games in and its hard to imagine playing this again.

RoNE has been given a poor shake due to the numerous minor issues with the components and exposition of rules, none of which is a game-breaker.  Yes, there are one or two printed errors, but all of them are easily patched.  Yes, the rulebook is unclear in several places, but clarifications are easy to come by in the game's forums.  Yes, it has a big honkin' box and insert; so what? On the table, it looks and plays handsomely.  If you like old-fashioned economic sandboxes, there is a good chance you'll enjoy 'RoNE', too.

I like the theme of this game and would love to play any other ones with this same kind of theme. But this game wasn't fun

Train wreck of a production, but the game is actually pretty good.

As the owner of the game put it... "This is the least railroady of all the railroad games."  This is really more of an economic game pretending to be a railroad game.

There is marginally some route building in this game, as you do want to connect to some specific cities, but largely you only want to build in cities where you have businesses. The game lets you build businesses which payout at variable rates depending on the economy and whether you "are connected" (have a depot in that city and a market city).  And there's a bonus for every additional market city you connect to.  And there are some special routes you can claim if you have depots in certain cities.  And there are cities that let you claim a state's mail delivery route bonus.  So you do kinda want to make certain "routes" but it really doesn't feel like a route building game that much.  

The businesses are largely generic as the "goods" don't matter except for the Maine player who wants two specific types and some players who will want hotels.  There's a bit of funky sheep business going on in the early game too.  So businesses are mostly just a schedule of payouts for different economic conditions tied to a particular location which you may or may not be able to "connect" easily.  And some of them are more susceptible to the disaster events.

I really liked the game.  It's a long game but it didn't really feel long while I was playing... well except when one player would forgo the game for other activities.  My only nit is really that the Maine player's paper/lumber bonus thingy seems a little wonky.  Sure Maine has further to go to get to a market city, but I think the bonus more than offset that in our game.  Maybe it was a perfect storm of the right businesses coming out, or maybe we failed to compete adequately, but it sure felt a little unbalanced.

Good cross between standard rail-building and Power Grid-style connections.  Random deck of businesses and events keep it from getting predictable, so good replay value.

Played it at GOF 2015 with the author!! Plus we had the new and revised rules! Even then, the game is essentially unplayable. The cards are unbalanced. If you get the Pinkerton card you are likely to win. The map is tedious, even if you live in New England. Very disappointing experience. Will try again, but that requires quite some "activation energy".

Under-rated. Very interesting game when you get someone to teach it who understands it. The economic aspects along with the route building are great. Some people are not going to like the disasters but at least you can see them coming and do some preparation.

An interesting spin on connection games (e.g. rail or power), with some unusual mechanisms I'd like to explore more.  Unfortunately, there as a lot more information to look at in any given moment than is practical.  The business cards have nice illustrations of the business in question occupying much of the upper half.  Much more useful would have been to have a minimap that shows where the heck the town or city is.  The industry illustration could still be on the card as a washed out background, or a smaller icon.

The health of the economy is controlled by a die roll, but you lucky dogs see it coming two turns in advance, which mitigates its effects greatly.

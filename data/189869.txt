Played once in a 2-player and it was OK but didn't feel it worked as well as I had hoped.  It seemed pretty to and fro with little to no strategy and therefore no building towards long term goals, which started to lose my interest.  Would rate it quite low but it hasn't really had a fair trial yet so I'll give it a middling rank for now and try it again some time.

A pleasant little game, though I had higher hopes for it. The butterfly colors are tricky to distinguish, especially across the table. I was playing Kingdomino, where there is an auction and tiles are numbered, and I thought that that game is more elegant while having the same goal.

RATING: 5
The card-playing and drafting is interesting, but unfortunately the point scoring relies on set collection when everyone is fighting for the same cards, so naturally it just becomes luck-of-the-draw for whether or not you can complete something on your turn.

Similar car flip to Honshu with two players.  Some strategy as you want to block your opponent from scoring.  Art is nice and card luck isn't overwhelming.  Quick and fun.

PnP of kickstarter version played. Overall a great, short, easy to teach and easy to play with the young ones but enough decisions to keeps adults entertained kind of game. I only played the 3-4 player game, but I could see a 6 player game being even more competitive. Beautiful art on cards, love the cohesive theme - cards are drawn from the deck to the 'field' where butterflies can be captured in your net (to your hand) and then played later (to the jar) and delivered for points. Simple to teach, straight forward to play, but some strategy when desciding what card to play in order to fulfill the order (for points) versus trying to prepare for an upcoming order, versus trying to play early enough to get the butterfly you want from the 'field'.Butterflies are a little smaller than I would like on the delivery cards, which is what you are trying to match for points; just hard for some of us olders to see colors clearly. Small butterfies on the delivery cards made it hard for grandma to play with the rest of us. I agree, a little hard for me too. My daughter loves the theme, and all of the beautiful butterflies on the cards. I like the balance of trying to look ahead at the upcoming delivery and trying to balance going first now to choose the butterfly card I want to capture in 'the field'. Come on, 15$? This is well worth it.gpv;15;10

* Kickstarted! *

Players choose a card from hand for both selection order (from the deck cards in the field) and to add the card's butterflies to their jar after taking the replacement card. Then, the up to eight butterflies in the jar may be used to take a garden card that earns victory points towards winning the game. Nice art, easy to learn… but the rules confuse garden and destination cards, which is a moment of confusion.

PLUS: a unique theme, easy to play
MINUS: rulebook confusion, not big on strategy

Nice filler game, have only played as 2 player, interesting decisions and nice artwork. Thing in someways that the theme makes it a bit more fiddley to play with my local board gaming group, as butterflys are everyone's thing. The game is nice though, like how the low / high / ablities make for interesting scoring moments in games.

Lightweight game where your make actions that take 2 turns to fully resolve. Or maybe each turn is like half of two different actions. I don't think the special powers add much to the game. They increase the complexity from "I can easily introduce this to non-gamers" to "When playing with non-gamers, I'll have to remind them of the special actions each round". They increase the breadth of the decision space without making it deeper.

The core system is fine and worth playing.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I've played a bunch of Dr. Finn's games and this is may be my favorite. Butterfly Garden is a relatively straightforward game, but has just enough to keep it interesting without any extraneous rules [i](which I find to happen a lot in his games)[/i]. Butterfly Garden is a set collection game with a few tweaks that set it apart from other games. The beginning of each round you play a card which will not only go into your tableau, which will be used to fulfill contracts, but also determine player order. In the 2p game turn order is extremely important as it determines which contracts are available for you to fulfill and since there are only two contracts out each round there is plenty of opportunity to thwart your opponents plans. 

The amount of player interaction is what elevates this game for me, you have to anticipate what your opponent is going to do and play accordingly. The 2p game feels especially strategic, based on how contracts can be fulfilled, and is probably my favorite player count. The artwork is also quite nice and the production is top notch. Butterfly Garden has definitely flown inder the radar, but I'd check it out especially if you have a chance to pick it up on Dr. Finn's site when he runs a sale.[/i]

Decent quick playing card game. It reminds me a little of Jaipur.  You are collecting cards with various combinations of butterflies to turn in for points. Unlike Jaipur, this game has a bid for turn order which can matter from time to time. Though this game plays to four, I believe Jaipur is still the better game. For some reason the market theme is a little stronger in that game.  Butterfly Garden is still an enjoyable game and can be easily played with a wide variety of people.  However, I can name many, many card game fillers I would choose before this one.

--Mar2017-- It's pretty; there are decisions.  Not too bad.  There's also a lot of chaos from the side effects (of the side effects) of the players choices:  so the end result seems to be pretty random.  Happy to play more, though.

Individual cards have one or more colorful butterflies.  Game points are awarded by assembling a set of several cards that fulfill a demand card that requires a specified assortment of colored butterflies. 

The count of visible demand cards is controlled to be fewer than the number of players.  Other players may be chasing the same card that you are. Turn order may matter.

A unique number on each card also serves to  establish turn order each round. Players must balance  playing a single  card between one that improves their color collection, or gives them turn priority.

Filler draft card game using hidden bid. Multi-use cards serve as bid value and butterfly combinations. Bid, draft card to hand, add bid card to jar, use cards from jar to match contract patterns to score points. Rinse, wash, repeat with some decent timing and strategy between getting a good bid cards versus collecting more butterflies.

Fun little contract fulfillment game. Cute  artwork and supports a good player count range (2-6). Very light, as the only way to fill the contracts is by getting lucky and drawing the necessary cards first. Wouldn't necessarily call it a "great" game, but it's definitely a good game.

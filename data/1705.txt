A really enjoyable bit of fun with more strategy than one might originally think. Our four player game lasted about an hour and was totally enjoyable. I hope to play this one again.

A fun card-based hockey game.  No hockey knowledge needed, at all.  Very much a poker-like game where reading your opponent / anticipating their play can lead to success.  Also rather random.  All-in-all, a fun game!

Basically War on ice skates.  Certainly more to it than War, but still shares the mechanism.  Longer than it needs to be...I'm a little surprised that people think it's best with more players, I would think that would make it go on longer.  I'd play again, but not one I'm going to seek out.

Owned as Phantoms of the Ice.  Off the shelf for the first time (after 20 years or so!) as we were in need of an 8 player game.  Enjoyed by most.  A little luck dependent as a result of the card draw.  A good beer and pretzels game.

Found the old Avalon Hill version (complete) at a thrift store when I was visiting my father in Northern Minnesota a few years back.  Just recently my boys were clamoring to learn a new game, so out Slapshot came.  Easy rules and play, and my 5 and 7 year old were quickly enthralled.  We all had fun and HAD to teach it to any of my gaming friends who came calling over the next couple of weeks.  Obviously not a deep thinking game, but still a fun party type game to fill in some time after you've burned up all your brain cells playing deeper games earlier in the evening.  Play is easy enough so that my boys can play by themselves without my assistance.  It's a winner all around. [Thrift $2]

RATING: 5
Can't say that I saw much of a game here.  The problem is that you get to choose your opponent each time, so the winner is usually pretty probable each time.   That makes it slightly lame... it would be better if you got more for beating better opponents and less for beating the weak guys up.

Update Apr 2011:   I remember now why I disliked this game... it's simply too long.   As a 15 minute exercise I would agree it's fun, but it's about 3 times too long for what it is.   Rating revised down to a 5 from a 6.

Ok, so I kinda sorta had fun playing this, but it was mainly do to the "wow, this is pretty bad, but so much so it's kind of hilarious" effect.  So, I can't rate it too poorly since some fun was had.

However, the game is essentially a game of drawing/stealing cards, and "playing" your team (hand of cards) against an opponent.  Playing an opponent is essentially a game of war, where you flip cards and see who played the higher card, scoring a goal for that player.

Now, you are allowed to order the cards yourself before the game of war.  However, the amount of bluff/double-bluff involved with organizing a hand of 6 cards is such that it just feels plain random to me.  To speed things along, we just shuffled out hand of 6 to see what happened, which seemed more fun than actually bothering to try to "outsmart" or outguess the opponent.

In the end, Slapshot is a just plain silly game that might be fun once in a while for the ridiculousness of it, but doesn't really have any interesting gameplay to make me want to play often.

I'm going to give this another shot with some rules tweaks but we played it and it was booooooooring. We played unlimited trades and that the both teams start with 0 points (that's how the Avalon Hill 1982 edition says you should play). I'm going to give the newer editions rules a look through and see if maybe I feel like bringing this out again. I'm thinking I might sell it though.

Tom Dalgliesh & Alan Moon game. Superb, Flawless game. The best light game i have ever played. You start to grow fond of the various players and everyone laughs and has a great time. We try to play with 5-6! The version I play uses players from Power Play, Phantoms of the Ice & Slapshot editions. 
Purchased in college, later in marriage and also from a trade.

Nice little game that's especially great when you need to accommodate a large number of players.  Here's a tip: instead of using paper & pen to keep track of how many trades and drafts players can make, give everyone a set of chips to spend - one color for trades, another color for drafts, and don't worry about tracking games played.

Slapshot is an unofficial end to the WBC convention on Saturday night as many people get up and leave early Sunday. It has a reputation for being something you actually do not want to win b/c it starts late and you have to stick around to play the next round.

Well, I had a severe case of beginner's luck, qualified as the last team for the playoffs then cruised through them undefeated for the victory. There's an unlikely combination of cards whereby a super lame character can actually score against goalies (who usually block all shots). It's rare, but I kept him in my deck and somehow scored three times with him (called "Pucking" someone). Despite winning my first ever WBC heat, I had no intention of continuing as I wanted to play Werewolf, so I didn't turn my table's card in. Did I miss my big chance to win a plaque?

This game needs six or more players who are in a rowdy mood to be any fun.  The individual hockey games are played in a manner that is very similiar to the very old, and very boring, game of war.  The theme is fun and the games mechanics promote fun for players in the right type of mood.  I won the WBC event in 2005, and came in fourth at the WBC in 2006 (out of 100  players) so I have no axes to grind with this one.

This is awful and also really long!  Its basically the card game war, with a hockey theme, and some mechanics for drafting and trading new cards grafted on.  I guess the hand management aspects are supposed to provide the strategic depth here, but the hockey matches (basically flipping over cards and comparing values) is so inane and mindless that I couldn't get much enjoyment out of the drafting and trading.  The trading is forced instead of by choice which breaks with the theme.  

Just not a good game.

Finally had a chance to try to new Columbia Games version, and it actually exceeded my expectations for what I thought the game was going to be.

For me, it was more of a social game than a deep strategic exercise, but the game did actually offer real decisions to make each turn.  The home ice advantage was a good balancing mechanism and the overtime rules made for some good fun.

The only bummer was the price point on the game . . . $25 retail was a bit high for what it is.

Meh.  It's okay.  The strategy mainly seems to be "get good cards," but getting good cards is sort of a crap shoot.  Maybe I'll play it again some time, but no big loss if I don't.

Draw, swap, or play... your only options in this great little hockey themed game.  There's a lot of randomness in this game... maybe a little too much for even MY tastes, but I find it to be a compelling little filler.

Try to get your team in shape for the playoffs... then play games with what's left.  The "Bruisers" can make or break a game, but higher hands will usually prevail.

I'd love to rate this higher, but the card draws are just too random.

A fun game for the right moment, as it is very light and quite random.  But it is a light-hearted game, with amusing artwork.  It kind of feels like War, but it is not completely random, and the trading makes for some interesting twists to the game.

Charming game.  Definitely fun.  Control is almost non-existant.  A dog-pile on the weakling effect can happen, making the game a bit painful for the victim.  But this status is temporary, as each opponent can only target you once, until they complete the rest of their games.  In the meantime you will improve your team through trades and drafting.

One of the most unique cards games that I have ever played. So light its hard to take a loss at this game seriously at all, most of the time you are cursing your luck, or chanting "WE'REE NUMBER ONE!" Games are played out in a non-random War fashion that has just a couple of simple rules but makes every game exciting, even when the outcome seems predetermined based on what the two teams looked liked. The addition of the Bruisers to the game was brilliant and keeps even the most honed team from running away with the championship. It may be simple, it may be chaotic, it may be very luck depenendent, but damn is it a fuckton of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Light card game which allows players to build hockey teams which are really hands for a series of games of war.  The cartoony humor on the Avalon Hill cards is a little dated and politically incorrect (not to mention goofy).  This can be a fun game with a large group when no one wants to think too much, but I will generally prefer a number of other light games to this.

RATING: 7
Got this game as a child - played it like crazy, even running a solitaire season. It's basically war, but, for some reason, the jokes don't seem to get old. Plus, there's nothing quite like identifying the 'weak one' at the table - the team with the worst players and no bruisers, that EVERYONE can take a turn with, and feel confident about getting a win.

This is basically the card game 'War', only with a hockey theme. Why rate it an 8, you ask? If you have ever been to this tournament at the WBC, you'd know why. It is usually played late Saturday night, so everyone is punch drunk from a whole week of the best boargaming anywhere. It consistently attracts over 150 players every year. If you go (you should go...), don't miss this tournament.

A very fun little game that unfortunately needs many players to achieve its maximum potential.  The only problem with adding more players is that it extends the time of the game.

This game has lots and lots of luck but it is very fun.  Basically you draft a team of five hockey players.  The players have varying skill and the occasional ability.  During your turn you either force a trade with another player, play a game, or trade with the deck.  The AH version is definitely the best version available.  Very few games work better with a Monopoly style outer track but this does.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I had heard a lot about Slapshot from a buddy [i]([user=madcapmartini]Mat[/user])[/i], specifically the tournament at the WBC [i](in which he came in 3rd place this year)[/i]. When Mat had some folks over for his birthday he ended up busting this out, who could unseat the champ? 

The artwork is great, each hockey player is a parody of a different character, mostly from movies and comics. The game play is simple, imagine the card game war with the ability to trade cards from your hand. Therefore any fun you will have playing the game will be completely  dependent on the people you play with. Slapshot serves as the perfect vehicle to have some laughs and bust your friends chops. Needless to say we had a blast, and in the end I was able to emerge victorious after Mat's wife and I battled for the cup! 

Where does that leave the game for me? I could see playing this with my family at holidays and having a lot of fun, but I think it would tank at a meet up unless folks at the table embraced the silliness. Slapshot is definitely a game worth experiencing at least once and one I'd recommend for family get togethers.[/i]

RATING: 6
Card game with which players can draft teams, set up schedules, and play out a season and then playoffs. Players are rated 1-10 but some cards have special abilities, in particularly the ability to injure opposing players, which forces owners to draw new player cards, which can change team strengths and outcomes. It's a good design and probably better with more players. My sense is that one's enjoyment is proportionate to one's love of hockey: I'm not a hockey fan, and as a game there doesn't seem like there's enough to it to satisfy over the long run. I pre-ordered the game, then totally forgot about the pre-order, but was reminded by the company, so I followed through and got it, June 2011. Sold December 2011.

RATING: 6
This can be fun with the right crowd when it's played quickly. Basically you trade in low cards for blind cards, hoping to get higher, or steal a card from someone else (and give them a low in return) or, once you feel like your hand of 6 cards is high enough, you engage another player in a match-off. Sort your cards (or simply shuffle them if you're in fun mode), both reveal one, whoever played the higher card scores a goal (unless one was a goalie, in which case no goal). Repeat until all 6 cards have been played. Most goals wins the match (in a tie, do it again but first goal wins). There's a few other tweaks but that's the jist of it. First to win 8 matchoffs plays off against the player with the second most wins for the game win. So there's not a lot of science, it being blind revelation and all, and don't challange unless you have a decent hand, but if everyone's in the right mood, play it real quick, cheer for the goals, etc, it can be some light fun for a bit.

Jan 18: 2012: This is disappointing with more than two players. The game drags exponentially with every player added to the game.

I should try the advanced version in which players must gave games with each other an equal number of times. With the basic rules, players will want to hold games with the weakest player, unbalancing the game.

Jan 11, 2012: One game, two players, did not finish the game due to time constraints.

Wow, this game is good!

Awesome combat/hockey game mechanism: you play war with your opponent with a six card deck that you stack yourself. The randomness is somewhat mitigated by the fact that (a) each deck must have one goalie, two defencemen, and three forwards and (b) you do have a sense of the strength of your opponent's hand. 

Too bad that the card quality is shit, especially for a game that's about $20.

One thing I prefer here is the much smaller German Power Play box version of this game by Amigo. What's with the Slapshot mid sized box Columbia Games? What can I say? I like the small boxes so I can have more games.

The fun here is what you make it. With the right attitude and the right crowd this is a bit of silly fun to lighten the mood. Where it goes wrong is overstaying its welcome. Five rounds to the playoffs and a best of three would be plenty for this type of game. There are not a lot of meaningful decisions to be made, which certainly speeds up the game, but it'd be nice for a variant to be added that would give it a little depth. Surprisingly after reading the rules and expecting a lot of spectator boredom I found this wasn't the case. Players are scouting the opposition and looking for weaknesses to exploit and bruisers to either avoid or play against for a good hand enema. You just play this one for a laugh and it might be better with alcohol.

I like the Adel Verpflictet guessing mechanism of a hockey match. The trading is a crapshoot and works with more players but helps 'balance the game. The 'bruisers' also help balance out the game.

Good fun with a big group. But I imagine downtime with more players.

A fun, mindless card game. There are only three options and your choices for each turn are very obvious. However, when played with the right people or as an end of the night filler, it is rather good.

RATING: 5
A kind of random game that really needs some house rules.  The real flaw of the game is the downtime.  Most players really have nothing to do when waiting for the resolutions.  Cards are silly, and it seems like the game could be more fun with fewer players.  

Decent enough filler, but there are too many better games out there.

RATING: 6
Light card game that seems luck-based (actually it is, because it is more or less down to luck which players you get), but during the matches it comes down to mind games. Simple but funny.

The mechanics of drafting, trading, or playing are great, the artwork and humor is excellent, and there are many decisions to make throughout, especially towards playoff time.  A great game for several players.

Rather enjoyable, but also a tad long. If players keep drafting and exchanging cards, this can easily take one hour, which is far to long for a game that is mostly silly fun.

Slapshot is part War part trading and a whole ton of luck. It sounds bad, it starts off pretty badly too but within a round or two awful cards start making their rounds of the table, great players getting knocked out, average players scoring game winning goals, winning teams are being targeted for trades and losing teams being challenged for 'cheap' wins. Not something I could play all the time but on the rare occasion this is a total blast.

Alright, so Super Slapshot was loads of fun.  As a game, it isn't all that much different than War really, where you have a hand of cards and a little bit of double think about the order to play them in.  However, because of the art and design of the cards, if you are in the right mood, it can be quite entertaining to play.

I would have absolutly loved this game when I was 12. I can picture myself playing game after game, simulating entire mini hockey seasons, which is what it takes for the bruisers to knock the good players off of team rosters and have them cycle back through the draft. Alas, I no longer have the patience for that, and in shorter stints, Phantoms of the Ice just isn't that interesting and certainly isn't balanced. Phantoms isn't a bad game, but it absolyely requires more time than I'm willing to invest in it to show its best qualities - and the game just isn't deep enough for me to do that. Teens and die-hard hockey fans will probably love this, however!

RATING: 4.5
Only a few plays so far, but it's pretty fun with the right group, have to find rules to make sure the player order doesn't have so much weight in the game. Constantly forcing a match with a team that just lost and has no time to strengthen his team feels like kicking a dead horse.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great, light fun! 

To the uninitiated may look at how "games" are resolved being no more than a luck factor (and it is). However, the true win/loss component of this game deals with player observation and player interaction during the trading of cards and trying to speculate who has the strongest and weakest team at any one time.

Any luck factor will be negated by someone with these gaming traits. 

Of course, the fun factor is acting like a bunch of hooligans at the same time! It's a great excuse!

A great little card game that is much more than "war".  You are allowed to arrange your team before a battle so there are some decisions that need to be made.  It is a great game to play with a large group who just want a fun time.

RATING: 7
Despite the sports theme that has initially turned off some of my gamer friends, everyone has enjoyed this game so far. It's not the most brain-burning game ever (one friend did extremely well by just playing the cards from his hand completely randomly), and the randomness of the draw can get a little aggravating at times, but overall it's a really fun game. Kwanchai's Super Slapshot redesign using geek culture characters is fantastic and a wonderful sight.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Has a certain charm to it, but when it comes down to it, this is still a largely chaotic game that has much more to do with who picks on who and how the randomness falls than any kind of strategy.  The art on the cards and the feel of the game is nice, but this is not really worth pulling out except for the most ardent fans of light, chaotic games, or diehard hockey fans.

I enjoy this game, though, perhaps, not as much as I was expecting.  It can play relatively quickly, and it's extremely easy to teach and play.  Borderline filler, or gateway game.  The mistake most people make -- including myself -- is spending too many turns drafting and trading trying to improve your team, when you should be challenging other players.  It might be a tad long for what you get.

玩家先不停的摸牌扔牌，也可以摸别人的牌但你得还别人一个同类型的牌，比赛的时候还可以用流氓牌把别人的球员废掉。不过总的来说重复摸牌也有挺无聊的。

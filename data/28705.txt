Played solitaire and it was fun. I am not a Baseball expert and was surprised to lose 7-1 with 6 points suffered in the 10th Inning.... an incredible sequence of cards in the Pitcher Advantage Deck... is it normal?

This game is great. For me it is the next coming of 3M's Pro Baseball (some may hate me for that statement, but I mean it as a good thing.) It is nice to have a game that can be used just to have a fun, quick romp with and not worry about the stats. Stats game have their place (I play them.), but they are not always needed.

A very light game which does a great job at capturing the feeling one gets at baseball games.  Very lucky however in how the various outcome cards draw out.  May just be a glorified rock - paper - scissors game.

The mounted board is way better than the Pizza Box Football one, which is a big plus.  This has no dice, either, but a pretty cool simplified pitch/bat mechanic.  It emulates baseball as you'd see it on TV, but sped up.  Sometimes, though, like in a real baseball game, you get frustrated when a team falls behind and can't seem to get their act together to catch up.

That said, I think the Pizza Box games emulate sports from a strategic level in a way I really enjoy.

I have not played with the advanced pitching rules, which is probably a must for diehard baseball fans which I am not.

A baseball simulation that while fun, especially if you roleplay, is not challenging. 80% of the time your real choices are: Swing or Take / Strike or Ball. Sometimes you can try to steal or bunt / pitchout and that does add a good extra amount of fun to the game, but it really needs more options to be taken seriously. Don't get me wrong, I had a lot of fun playing this with teenagers and I can see how it could work with non gaming baseball aficionados, but it simply lacks enough meaningful choices to be a good game. 

For example, the best way to play is Pro Ball, best out of 5 games were your full pitching rotation comes into play. Game one you start your best starter who promptly gets creamed, to the tune of three homeruns in inning 4 (statistically this is highly unlikely, but it happened): in a real baseball game that starter would be removed, as obviously he is having a bad day. The game does not simulate a good pitcher having a bad day, so it would better to leave him in than bring in an inferior long reliever. 

Now there are supposed to be optional rules online which I need to check for things like fast runners. But what the game really needs to shine for me would be additional complexity. Not just whether to throw a strike or ball but where over the plate or which type of pitch. I'd like to see a hitters batting average and power be meaninful based on his stats rather than simply on his batting order. I would like to simulate a pitcher having a good or bad day depending on something else than just his quality # and the luck of the draw.

Nice sports adaption. Really feels like a baseball match. Well thought out mechanics and a good system to add more complexity when you get to know the game better. This also allows this to be played by people with different skill levels.

Unfortunately baseball is not this popular in Europe. So getting a baseball themed game to the table is sheer impossible. Traded it away to give it a better home.

This game rocks and hosts all the elements of baseball to keep you excited to open the box again tomorrow.  The creators "Smith Brothers" will no doubt continue to build on an excellent game design mechanic and may even solitaire play and MLB teams?!  I totally love the look of the game and all its components (as I do Pizza Box Football)These are my two favorite sports games.  Reviews hardly do the game justice - you need to play it to see.  Very accurate and statistically proportionate.

RATING: 4.5
1 play on the easiest level, 1 on the hardest. The hardest added a lot of fiddly rules - stealing, bunting, pitch outs, different batters. That didn't have much effect on which card I chose, and the cards I chose seemed to have no effect on the outcome of the at bat. I felt like I had zero control.

RATING: 6
I don't like baseball much, but this one is actually quite fun!  I like the mechanism of guessing what how the opponent is going to try and pitch/bat, and having a better shot at a hit if you guess correctly.  A lot of thought has gone into making this game like a real baseball game, including tiring pitchers, bunting, stolen bases, etc.  I'd certainly get this to the table when I'm in the mood for some tabletop baseball!

Played a few times on A and a couple times on AA. My son seems to like it, but it doesn't do much for me. Then again, I'm not a huge baseball fan, so I'm probably not the target audience. Plus, I've only played through the AA rules. AAA looks like it might be the "real" game, but perhaps too much baseball for my tastes too, so I don't really expect my rating to go up.

Great baseball game.  Plays intuitively, even at the AAA level.  Lends itself well to a series.  My only concern at this point:  there are some really decent hits in the pitcher control deck (my son had a three run homer in our last game) and there are lots of outs in the batter control deck.  I felt somewhat like the card draft was too random.  We'll see after extended plays, which we intend to do, because the game is still incredibly fun to pay.  We've had lots of good baseball "moments" already.

Played the prototype with the designer at Origins 2007.   It really moves fast and captures the feel of a baseball game, with a slightly scalable level of detail.   Moving the pegs around might be a little tedious after a while, but this game looks to be very original.

RATING: 4
A quick, easy, fun baseball game with almost no strategy to it at all. Deciding whether to play a black or white card might seem important, but is really a complete crap-shoot. The game boils down to drawing a card and seeing what the result is. "Pro" rules add a little strategy for substitutions and pinch-hitters, but since players are generic this decision is usually obvious. Base-stealing, pitch-outs and bunting are the only serious choices to make.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Excellent baseball game.  If you are a fan of baseball, you need to pick this one up.  A unique system that feels like real baseball.  The anticipation of flipping the cards to see the out come of the result is tense.

RATING: 8
Like Pizza Box Football, the basic game probably isn't worth playing except with children, but it's a good way to learn the game.  Try playing 3 innings with the level 1 rules, then move up to the level two rules and beyond.  The game gives you a feel of a baseball game but plays quickly.  I like it!  Serious fans may not like that not every pitch is represented (rather, you play out each "at bat" rather than each pitch).  The cards are a little flimsy; I'm planning on putting them in sleeves.

I'm a baseball fan, but if I weren't, I'd knock this down to a 4.  It's a good simulation as simulations go, but there is almost no strategy in the game.  It's basically a bluffing game where the hitter tries to guess if the pitcher will throw a good pitch or a bad pitch from his limited hand of cards.  It's a game I see bringing out to play with the kids, but ultimately, I was pretty disappointed with this one.

I was wondering if they could pull off a baseball game that played as well as their football.  Well, they did.  It plays a great game of ball, and gets some pretty decent results.  I don't know how they would be able to tailor it towards specific teams like they do with the football game, other than maybe new pitcher cards.  But who knows, if there is a way to do it then these guys will find it.  Great game and a lot of fun.

Baseball is a game of statistics and lends itself to statistical boardgame play better than any other. Games that don't use actual statistics tend to feel generic and lacking because you lose the sense of a [b]specific[/b] matchup between a hitter and a pitcher. PBB attempts to add character and detail without the stats and I would say it probably succeeds better than any other I've played - not that I've played them all. It matches the strategic approaches to the at-bat with some additional considerations about the relative strengths of hitters in the batting order. One way to gauge the success of a simulation is how closely game scores resemble real scores. The Pizza Box franchise gets this right in both of their games, but while I found the constant dice-rolling in PB Football to be tedious, the card play in PB Baseball is fun.

Very simple play-by-play game, but quite fun.  I like the way they handle pitcher fatigue: actually, one of the best (I like Statis pro better).  Generic players make it less a draw for me, but I like the ease of play and the flow, and how they have tried to differentiate between player types.

I really wanted to like this game.  I tried it with the basic rules and was bored to tears.  I was prepared to get rid of it, but I thought it had gotten short shrift, so I created rosters for all the 2008 MLB playoff teams, learned all the rules (including the rules online for fast runners, etc) and tried it again.  Result: it was a LITTLE bit better, but still knew it would only collect dust in the collection.  Yer outta here!

The Pizza Box guys did an excellent job of again distilling a sport down to a very simply match+random mechanic.  That said, I don't like it as much as I do Pizza Box Football.  Part of that is I feel drawing a result from a deck simply doesn't give as much psychological satisfaction as rolling dice.  The other (perhaps bigger) part is that I simply don't care for baseball as a sport.  

Baseball fan mileage may vary.

I'm not that much interested in generic baseball games, but what I like about this design is its use of cards and avoidance of creating a game that goes pitch-by-pitch (and instead is one at-bat at a time). Additionally, the designers built in successive levels of complexity, for savvy baseball enthusiasts. So as a battle of baseball wits, it encompasses the strategy of the game within a format that doesn't take too long to play. 

This nicely supplants a similar older title like "Strategy Baseball," which is an okay design but takes too long to play. Still, personally I didn't find this game to be streamlined enough to be something I'd want to play. In that regard, "Harry's Grand Slam Baseball" fits the bill.

Pretty much a total random fest.  Mind you, I don't mind games with random elements.  But this game starts off by making you think you have some control over your decisions, but in reality, this is far from the truth.  The whole game could be quantified into a coin toss.  I love baseball and was really looking forward to this game, but IMO strays far from the enjoyable experience I had playing Pizza Box Football.

As much as its football counterpart misses, this game surpasses my expectations and I wish the football version was more like this game.  No dice in this game, completely card driven with many more options.  This has the feel of baseball.  Still high luck but entertaining none the less.

RATING: 6.8
I've had Pizza Box Football for a couple of years, but I like this Baseball game better because it's card-driven.  Much quicker and it just feels right.  It's not a perfect simulation or anything and you don't get the pitch by pitch drama of baseball (each card turn is one at-bat not one one pitch) but that's why it plays fairly quickly.  And there's still plenty of drama (steals, bunts, etc.).  Lots of fun for my 6 year-old and me.

I just LOVE this game. It has all the tension and excitement I associate with watching my favorite team (The Boston Red Sox) play a terrific game of baseball. The Smith Bros. designing team (cough! cough!) have analyzed Major League Baseball data and incorporated their findings in such a way that the gaming experience is extremely realistic. You're much more likely, of course, to experience Outs than Hits, which is to be expected, but the tension of finding out which it's to be is sublime. And with the complexity of its advanced variants (all there; no need to purchase anything other than the basic Pizza Box), and the relative speed of the game play, it's (IMHO) a much more enjoyable game than its predecessor, Pizza Box Football. Of course, this may have something to do with my personal inclination toward baseball. Once you understand the cards involved and how they work, the game is fast. Defense secretly chooses a card (Ball or Strike). Offense responds with a card (Swing, Take, Bunt or Steal). The card matchup leads to one of three Result decks and the result is initiated. Bang! You're on to your next batter. They've created rules that allow newbies to ease into some of the game's complexities, but I dove right into the Pro Ball option and though I struggled early, figuring out just what was supposed to be happening, I don't regret it. There's something to be said with playing at the simplest level first (I believe they recommend playing a couple of innings at that level and then adding 'components' - rules, as the game progresses; not a bad idea, but not completely necessary, either). Love it, love it, love it!!

I'm a huge baseball fan, so I'm always excited by the prospect of a new game. It's not terrible like the football game, but it's not very interesting either, suffering from a lack of personality.

I should update my comments about Pizza Box Baseball.  I really like Pizza Box Football, I also really like Pizza Box Baseball.


But there are some problems with it depending upon what type of a gamer you are.  

First, A football game is a football game, each game plays itself out, and at the end of the game you're done.  That's it.  

Baseball is much much different.  In Baseball you play a series.  And depending upon the day, the pitching, the wind, and a little luck, you'll hopefully win, but the end result is to hopefully win more times than you lose.  That's the problem that you can get into with Pizza Box Baseball.

You really need to play a series of games (World series style is a pretty good indicator) to get a feel for the game, and to get the nuisances of switching pitchers, and whether people are rested, etc.

Of course, that means that you need to have a friend that you can consistently play against.  I had that a while back, I no longer do.  It was a blast when we played this way, but now it sits on the shelf, and any time I want to play a two player game with someone, or someone new, I would reach for football (or something else) way before I would reach for baseball, even though, in the end, I really do like the baseball game.

So there you have it.  My impressions take it for what you will.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
I adore baseball and I enjoy games that let you play baseball without getting bogged down in too much minutia (computers do a much better job [Diamond Mind Baseball] than Strat-o-Matic and the like).

So I thought this would be a good one for me.  It turns out it is not.

I know people say it is Candyland and I see what they mean, but that doesn't bother me as I really enjoy PB Football (aka, Chutes and Ladders).

What I found so dull about the game is there is no tension.  You do a lot of card flipping/shuffling and peg/tile moving without anything happening.  those who don't like baseball would say then it is a perfect baseball simulation.  Ha, Ha.  

But it does get to the problem of the game - no tension.  In real baseball there is a lot of space with no action, but there is some tension between every moment of action.  

Even PB Football has it.  There is good tension between dice rolls seeing if you'll hit that big pass or sack the QB.

Harry's Grand Slam Baseball, a simple, old basball card game has that tension because you are trying to string together your cards for a big inning while hoping your opponent doesn't lay down that double play or crucial strikeout card in between.

PB Baseball almost puts you in a card laying trance because most card plays leave little or no interesting changes in the game state, yet you play so many cards all of the time you just get numb to the "action".

I guess I'm saying it is a lot of doing things that don't do anything, but without even the moments of pause where you are hoping for the big event.





Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

So far I've played the game on each level 1 through 4, and enjoyed it a lot. And me not a sports fan, either. Currently in the midst of a five-game series, and looking forward to more plays. It's appealing that a game can be played fairly quickly.

It's interesting that the game works on both ends of complexity, too (not that it's ever terribly complex). Level 1 play is light and random, and level 4 play has just enough incentives for second-guessing to pull off the pitching duel concept.

The full rules are well scheduled. Very interested in trying team play, too. I can't think of any other sports games that support more than 2 players, so this could fill a real need in that regard. I can see a bit of a problem in getting six players who understand the (level 4) pitching rules, but with a seasoned player on each side to play the starting pitchers you could probably orient new players as you go.

this game is really fun with the lvl 3 and 4 version. 1 and 2 are too basic for me to really enjoy.

Great baseball feel.  Want to try the variant that uses real players.

It is fun to play but doesn't feel like baseball.  For the hitter to have an advantage, you have to use the "Take" card while hitting-- that doesn't make sense to me.  Still a nice simple game that can be fun and usually ends up with a score you would expect to see in a real baseball game.

With Vasel's approval, this looks like a decent game. In general, I'm not a sports fan, but the slower pace of baseball seems to be appropriate for a board game.

Multiple ways to play.  It can be very simple and quick or rather complex and nuanced.  It can also be somewhere in between.  You can also play a series of games managing your pitching staff or play with up to six players.  I recommend this for baseball gamers.

[One Pre-Release Play @ Origins] Pizza Box Baseball is a great game and is filled with lots of tension and excitement. It's not a statistical recreation like Strat-O-Matic, but it offers a top-notch baseball experience in about an hour, with several levels of ruleplay to tailor the game to suit your tastes.

My game was thrilling - I had an early 5-1 lead after 6 innings, then my relief pitchers came in and blew the lead. I ended up surrendering 7 runs over the last three innings, including a Pinch Hit 3-run homer in the top of the 9th, and lost the game 8-6. What a game. 

I enjoy PB-Baseball more than Football due to the lower barrier to entry - it's a much simpler game to explain, visualize and get into, in my opinion, because of the great use of the pitcher/hitter cards and the novel decks used to determine at bat results.

It's a winner in my book, and even after just the one play, I'd rate this at 8.5/10 -- it's a solid game, and with a few tweaks and some of the advanced rules Erik Smith is talking about either including in the core game or making available online, this should keep baseball fans happy for a long, long time!

It definitely captures the feel of a baseball game, but I would like more baseball scenarios than pitching and hitting.

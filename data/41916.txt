This game is a hit with the kids, magnets are used to great effect in this game, graphics are nice, and kids can beat adults.

Random distribution wall distribution and chit draw create unbalanced plays, but plays are quick enough not to sour the mood.

RATING: 9
Amazing game. Loads of fun. Lot of replayability since you can change up the maze underneath or even add/subtract walls to increase/decrease difficulty. It is great to see everyone's eyes when they grasp the concept of a ball being slid under the board which is magnetized to your pawn. We usually play with the house rule of putting out a number of tokens matching the number of players. The family LOVES this game and it gets a lot of table time.

This game is so far my favorite to play with my 3.5 year old son. The mechanic is fun enough for him to stay focused and for the adults not to die of boredom. We use some of the bits you pop out of the board to mark walls for my son, so it levels the playing field a little.

Just outside of the top level children's games I own. The things that keep it out are -

* Information is given away when pawns pass
* Luck can and often does decide games

These things aren't killers because despite the niggles we still enjoy this one a lot and it gets regular play.

Another great game to play with little ones. My 5 year old son loves the game and constantly wants to keep playing.

RATING: 8.5
Create a labyrinth by inserting little wooden walls into the slats in the base of the game, then place the grid-like game board on top. Each player controls a magnetic pawn, which holds a metal marble to the underside of the board. Players try to slide their pawn around the board to collect treasure tokens-- but if they try to move over a wall their ball will fall and they will have to move their pawn back to it's starting position.
The components are big and pretty, the artwork is gorgeous. Games this pretty usually cost upwards of $50 (this one's got a $30 MSRP).  
Magical Labyrinth has an irresistible appeal: Everyone who sees it being played immediately wants to try it.
Hard to think of a better family game than Magical Labyrinth; and it makes a fantastic filler for adults, too.

Hi! I'm Doctor Steve Brule with another episode of [b]Brule's Rules[/b]

Have you ever played Magic Labyrinth with a little kid and beat them way too easy? Just let them use a regular six-sided die! You can even buy a 16mm wooden one at either FRPGames.com or AwesomeDice.com, with a slightly darker finish so that you can tell them apart at a glance from the modified one that comes with the game. Why didn't you think of that, ya dingus?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This game has a clever system whereby the board sits on the box, and a second "board" below it has slots into which you put wooden walls.  The slots correspond to the borders of the squares on the board.  Players use pawns which are magnetic, and put a steel ball under the board that the pawn holds.  As you move the pawn, if the ball below the board hits a wooden wall, it is held while the pawn continues to move, causing the ball to be lost - it drops down and is returned by a ramp to one of the corners of the box.  The pawn must then go back to the starting corner to have the ball re-attached.

So the game is all about discovering the walls, and remembering where they are (or, more importantly, where the paths are).  Players draw a single token from a bag, which has a symbol on it.  Place the token on the matching symbol on the board (every space has its own symbol).  The goal is to collect tokens by moving on to them.  Players take turns rolling a die with values 1-4(?), and moving that many squares, orthogonally only.  Once the token is collected, another is drawn.  Play to 5 tokens.  

Very clever memory game.  Which tokens come out when will obviously have a big impact, but it's fun when played with children, and a nice change-up from the standard memory type games.   My kids enjoy it, and the pawn/ball mechanic is fun for them to invent games with as well.  I would not play this with adults, but it makes a great gift for kids - I'd recommend ages 6-9 will enjoy this most, based on my own kids.

RATING: 6
Juego muy básico, para niños. Un panel repleto de símbolos distintos. Se saca un símbolo de la bolsa, y los jugadores deben tirar el dado hasta llegar al símbolo. La gracia del asunto es que, los peones son imanes y por debajo del tablero, cada peón tiene adherido una bola. En los movimientos por el tablero la bola puede chocar con unos tabiques de madera que permanecen ocultos, y perderla. Cuando eso ocurre, tienes que volver a empezar desde tu esquina. Es un juego puro de suerte y de memoria. Sin estrategia ninguna. De todos modos, es bastante entretenido y adecuado para niños de 5-6 años. Cumple su misión.

Like almost every Drei Magier Spiele game, this one has a really cool gimmick the first time you play it.  In this case, it's navigating an invisible maze through the cool use of magnets.  It basically boils down to a memory game, as you gradually gain information about where you can safely move unobstructed, and where the walls are.

The whole point of the game is to capture glyphs.  There is one random glyph on the board at a time, and the first to reach the glyph claims it, with a new glyph being drawn to replace it.  This is really where a ton of luck enters the game.  The glyphs all have preset start spaces, and sometimes when a glyph is drawn, it will be right next to a player, while being nearly inaccessible to other players.  But heck, you're playing a kid's game about moving a marble through a maze, so who cares.

Overall, I had a great time laughing at everyone knocking into walls.  That's par for the course for Drei Magier.  Games I have a blast with the first two or three times until the gimmick got old, at which point they aren't anything spectacular.  Kudos for always having cool ideas though!

This is a children’s game which reminds me a bit too much of Magical Maze… It’s not a rip-off, but the idea has definitely been seen before. Not that either of them are better than the other; both games are basically memory games in which you also need to be quite lucky. If you roll a high number you can move far and perhaps be lucky to pull a chit which is close to your player piece. You randomly move your pawn onwards to the chit without knowing what way you should go, and sometime you hit a wall, but this is where the memory aspect kicks in. It’s probably a great game for kids, and I guess my rating would be 7 or so for that, but for me as a ”gamer” it’s obviously not particularly interesting.

Played with my 4 year old and it might have been a little too tough for her. I think I spent more time trying to help her get through the maze as opposed to remembering my own side of the maze. I definitely think this is a good game, but definitely frustrating for my daughter as she was done after collecting 3 of 5 tokens. I may have to wait a little longer to try it again with her, but it is definitely a good children's game.

The engineering and ingenuity of this game is what shines with the metal balls and magnet meeples. It amounts to a great memory game that can set up 'edge-of your-seat' moments as a player moves their pawn a final step to see if there is or isn't a wall there. 

It can be luck prone if all the drawn tokens show up on your side of the board. But, they are fast, easy and fun games so everyone usually has a good time.

I have decided that when I rate a 'kids game', I am going to consider the opinions of the children I am playing with.  We tried this one with our friends' 6 year old girl and it was a hit.  She loved the theme of us all being wizards and was surprisingly the best at remembering where the magic walls were.  Interestingly, our young gamer was quick to catch on to the fact that at times the game was 'unfair', as it randomly could place the next victory chit within spaces of one player.  

I think this is a game we will keep and enjoy with our kids for a limited time, then once they are complaining about how the victory chits are placed, we will quickly trade it away.

It's a pretty light kids game, that's subject to the draw more than most. But at the end of the day the game is pretty fun.

An OK game but it doesn't entertain me to try and figure out the unseen pathways beneath the floor. I mean, I wouldn't turn down a game necessarily, but I have no interest in seeking out a play. Conversely, I do plan on replaying its sister game, Fluch der Mumie (Pyramid), which I find a lot more interesting. FdM is more about the player interactions and less about spatial cognition.

A very good family game. It is hard to find games that bridge the gaps between a six year old, ten year old, and parents. This game can be broken out and played enjoyably with any combination of people. I love the clever design of the game, the simplicity. The only shortcoming is that it makes me feel dumb -- my memory is not what it used to be!

Simple and easy to teach, beautifully produced. A great game with kids, adults, or both at the same time.
The setup and number of chits you play for allow you to adjust the difficulty and length of the game. The setup is even part of the fun, as is when you reveal the maze at the end of the game. It's a pure memory game, so there's no deep strategy, just a quick, elegant game you can bring out with just about anyone.
It doesn't come out as often as I thought it would — I suspect many people find it frustratingly difficult — and that's too bad!

Top rated kid's game. 2009 award winner.  Troll & Toad

A memory game--I keep getting amazed at how many variations there are.  Also a game of deduction.  Very different--a hidden maze that you figure out through your movements and those of your opponents.

I rate children's games based on my interest in playing them with the appropriately children.

Kids' game often involve a memory component which just as often makes those games less interesting as they become older and start developing other skills. The Magic Labyrinth isn't anything special in that regard. In a sense, it's just another memory game.

What does make it different, however, is the presentation. The magnetic path-finding is mostly a gimmick, but it is a gimmick that both works nicely and looks and feels great at the same time. This "Wow" factor makes trying to find your way through the labyrinth a fun challenge even for those who don't much like the memory exercise otherwise. A worthy winner of the KdJ.

Magic Labyrinth is really just a memory game with the usual cool components we typically see from Drei Magier Spiele. The kids enjoy it, though the game can go on longer than it should and the token placement can be random and unfair at times (though everyone benefits from the same randomness equally?) But at the end of the day, it's still just an upjumped memory game.

There is a similar feeling one may get when playing Das magische Labyrinth to Kobbert's aMAZEing Labyrinth.  Both take place in magical mazes with a similar goal - to collect artifacts.  

The similarities between the games really end there.  Kobbert's game is largely a tactical adventure though a shifting maze.  Das magische Labyrinth on the other hand is a memory game with a splash of luck.  Das magische Labyrinth's walls are invisible so one must recall their steps if they are going to make any progress.  

The invisible wall mechanic is cleverly accomplished with magnets, and a maze of walls built beneath the board.  The walls can be reset for each game, but not moved during the game.  This allows for huge replay as the game board can always be rebuilt.

Although Das magische Labyrinth is a memory game, through it's beautiful presentation and unique design it becomes more of an addictive race puzzle.  There is always the feeling you can do better next time.  

All in all a very fun filler for adults and game for the little ones.

This is a nice light game, that's fun to play, but more so with the family. Kids will surely get a kick out of it and you'll have fun playing with them. You're basically trying to find your way to the game pieces, before everyone else on the board, but the trick is that the walls are invisible and you don't know where they are. Requiring a bit of memory, to try and get through the maze and to be able to get to the game pieces first.

The components? Well, if you can get passed the penis pawns, with steel balls. Ummm, well, I guess they're ok. Surely another design would've been prefered.

Many thanks, to my good friend Matt, for picking me up a copy.

A big hit with my son! Very nice memory game with a neat trick: the labyrinth is actually hidden under the board which makes it effectively invisible. By removing some of the hidden walls, the game can be made easier and accomodate young children - younger than the suggested 6 years.

RATING: 7
Setup is not as bad as I would have thought.  Little ones will need help checking for no dead ends.  There is potential for frustration when learning the maze, or failing to remember the safe path.  It's also tough to play two games in a row and not confuse what you learned in the previous game.  All that said, it is a wonderful game with lots of cheers and oh-no moments.

As a children's game, this is very good.  I've played this several times with my children and it's been a very enjoyable experience.  It's a kids game that you can play with your kids and not dread playing it.  With that said, I'd never request to play this with my gaming buddies.  It's a clever kids game, but not one that translates well to an adults only crowd.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2011)

I didn’t want to try this game as it was advertised as a child´s game, however I ended up playing it and I was very surprised. The game is like no other game I have played, very creative use of magnets indeed, also it offers a lot of fun. 

The game has its fair share of luck, but I don´t mind as it plays so quickly. Also to play it properly you need to exercise your memory, a favorite mechanic of mine :D.

I´m rating it a 6.0 because I feel the game feels samey after a couple of games, so this is not a game I would like to play too often, perhaps once every two months. Still a great game for children and adults.

RATING: 7
Excellent idea, well executed. Maze is built beneath the game board and marbles attached to the pawns under the board by magnets indicate if you've hit a wall. Players will either enjoy this maze/memorization game, or be frustrated beyond belief. Hard to build the maze so that players are equally challenged from all corners.

Update almost 5 years later... The kids (now 8 and 13) STILL enjoy this memory variant (unofficial) of the Amazing Labyrinth series. My fiance, however, finds it frustrating and wants me to "lose" it. :-)

RATING: 10
THis is a game that will never leave my collection.   I thought it was fun with my Son ( now 8, but had him play at 7, ) but then I tried it with adults only . . . and it's even better.  Lots of laughing - at yourself and others when they forget where a wall is, or when they think they've got their item - just to hear the click of hitting a wall, and the dropping sound of the ball to one of the corners.  I could see adding little house rules, but for now will play by the rules.

I don't like giving 10's - but decided I must when it comes to games like this that so many people enjoy.

Social rating - 10.  Lots of player interaction and fun.  Can easily drink a beer or wine / eat some appys with this game. I'm going to bring it to our next guys night to play with 30 something year old guys while drinking beer and eating.

Rated from my (and my daughter's) perspective.

There are a lot of different kid games involving magnetism.  This is probably one of the most unique.  

My daughter and I usually play without the die, which I think would be annoying.  It's a little too difficult still for my kids, but I think they will grow into it.  Even I have a tough time trying to remember where all the different walls are.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a lot of fun.  Not a brain burner, but still a good time.  Have someone who isn't playing set up the maze so there aren't any arguments about knowing the maze.

Good balance between luck of the dice and memory (remembering which passage contains a wall and which doesn't). Moreover, it has an attractive look and interesting use of magnets to hide walls. The game is interesting both for children (my almost six-year-old daughter likes it and can play it easily) and adults (it is not that easy to remember all 19 walls; and there can be even 24 of them). Another advantage - the game is not long. Almost a perfect children-adult game.

Šaunus derinys sėkmės (kauliuko metimas) ir atminties (kur yra siena, o kur nėra). Be to, patraukli išvaizda ir įdomus magnetų panaudojimas paslepiant sieną. Žaidimas įdomus tiek vaikams (mano beveik šešių metų dukrai jis patinka ir ji jį lengvai žaidžia), tiek suaugusiems (ne taip paprasta atsiminti visas 19, jau nekalbant apie 24, sienas). Dar vienas privalumas - žaidimas pakankamai neilgas. Beveik tobulas vaikų-suaugusiųjų žaidimas.

Kids game
Nobody likes it in our family. Sorry... The children have learnt quickly, and taught me, how to cheat. It is easy. You move your figure slowly, and you feel when there is a hidden piece of wall beneath you. But even before this 'tactic' they did not get the essence of the game. They got bored quickly in memorizing the hidden walls, and started moving randomly, using only luck... So it is definitely not our piece of cake. It was praised by most, but I was disappointed. Pros: the quality.

One nice thing about this game is that you can scale the difficulty by choosing the number of "invisible" walls to be included.

Me encanta el concepto del juego: la "aparición" de muros invisibles que nos cierran el camino y nos obligan a empezar a movernos de nuevo por el laberinto invisible. Tal vez echo en falta que los peones fueran más "humanos", más figuras de magos y no la especie de peones de ajedrez culturistas que le han endiñado. El juego tiene dos niveles de dificultad y fomenta la memoria de los peques (y de los mayores). Es, sin embargo, muy aleatorio en cuanto a la aparición de los símbolos en el tablero, con lo que nada te asegura la victoria, ni aún teniendo la memoria de Einstein. Merece la pena tenerlo.

The little magician apprentices have lost some magic objects inside of the master’s maze. Now they try to collect them before the Master notices anything. However, in the maze there are invisible walls and only one of the missing objects is revealed at a time. So they have to make their way through the maze by means of a good memory and lots of skill.

Each player moves their magician over the board while trying not to bump the labyrinth below. Each magician is joined with a magnetic ball so if you hit a wall the ball drops and you have to start all over again.

This game rocks! Beautiful components and artwork, clever labyrinth, and the buttplug-wizards are a delight to move around the board (with their little felted bottoms).

It's surprisingly hard for me to remember what I did less than a minute ago, which keeps the playing field quite level. My kiddo (age 7) has no problems with the rules, and digs the game.

I don't generally enjoy memory games, but this one is a glaring exception. It moves briskly, offers genuine challenges, and it's a pleasure as a physical object -- I don't think it would feel the same as, say, and app.

Re-rated from a 9 to an 8. Still a fabulous game, but at 17 plays I've seen it a lot. We should probably try random walls.

Fun game with a couple 5-year olds...

We improvised some rules - I let them choose their starting corners, and I chose a much further away corner so that they each had an advantage... and we just ignored the die entirely.

This led to some quick scores, which the kids appreciated, and created some dramatic turns (where I almost spanned the whole board in order to reach a distant target).

Next time we will try it with the rules as stated...

I'd give this kids game a try.

There is a maze underneath the board and you have a pawn magnetically associated with a ball under the board. You move your pawn around to the target items and try to be there first. If you're there first, you win the item. Player with the most collected items wins.

If you hit a wall, your ball falls out and you start over.

Video Review: https://youtu.be/m1G5sdLtHoc

Magic Labyrinth is a family game with a magnetic twist. Under the main board you construct a maze, which is hidden when the board is placed back on top. Players then race to get treasures with magnetic counters on top and ball bearers underneath. If you hit a wall you lose the ball bearing and have to return to your starting place. So you must try and remember your path. 

A great game for families.

A nice twist on a memory skill game. I really enjoy playing it with my kids. But prefer not to play with four players.
I say: make a complex maze, sit a kid on either side of you and try to beat them. And there you have it: a kids game that's a good challenge for a gamer parent! (Just don't make it too hard, or the kids may get disheartened and quit)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Another excellent children's game published by Drei Magier Spiele (they also published my favorite children's game - The Enchanted Tower). This game has amazing components, it has held up quite well. Everything is chunky and easy to manipulate for children. My youngest daughter loves this game and my older kids always want to play whenever I take it out. That, for me, is the sign of a truly great children's game. I would actually play this with my gaming group if I could get them to sit down and play. 

This is a game I still love playing with my family. I would highly recommend to anyone with children, even as a gift to people who may not play a lot of games.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]- Beautiful production 
- A great game for young kids that can be enjoyed by the whole family
- Everyone in my family enjoys this game, it is not just for little kids.

After the success of The Enchanted Tower we got this for our youngest daughter's (4) birthday. She absolutely loves it, as do my older kids.

*Someone had mentioned keeping the little rectangular cut outs from punching out the game in order to place them on the board once you find out where walls are. This definitely helped my little girl play this game and really enjoy it.[/i]

RATING: 5
An OK game, but the board should be bigger so that it's not just sheer luck if a new treasure is located in your proximity - probably best with 2 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game Drei Magier Worthy ! Fits Perfectly in the series of 'Geistertreppe', 'Nacht der Magier'... a must have game.
My little Kasper (4,5y old) liked the idea a lot, but it's still a bit to hard to play by itself, without help of memorising the walle he met already. On the other hand, the idea pleases him a lot. And as I said for myself already : the Drei Magier stuff is good stuff for the kid : nice to watch, nice to play and focused on the kids fun.

Standard "secret maze with a magnet" game, don't slide over a secret wall or your magnetized ball will drop and your turn is over. Been done before (see Magical Maze), but at least it's done here with nice components. The squares on the board are covered by a plethora of different symbols, and each player will in turn attempt to reach the current symbol (as pulled out of the bag) before the others. Get it and another symbol is pulled, first to get 5 symbols wins. The problem with this version is that whoever sets up the secret maze has an advantage, no matter how much they try and forget, or rotate the board beforehand, or set it up days before even. At least in Magical Maze the maze came in 9 sections which could be mixed up and rotated in a hidden way with no one getting any undue information. Anyway, this is obviously nothing but a huge memory game and your enjoyment (and result) will depend on whether you look forward to remembering where 20+ walls are as they're revealed. Not my favourite genre. Kids can do well in it, but it's not generally they're favourite genre either, it being work and all.

My son was more interested in the physics of magnetism rather than the game, and because he was more in awe of the chasing in Pyramid, that is a better maze game (albeit without the memory element, which isn't really interesting here as it is mainly building a memory map and not committing anything practical to memory, such as Sidibaba for example).

Actually it is nicely done, and implementation well thought; however, it may take quite some time until you find your ways through the labyrinth, and be quite frustrating until then - therefore risk is high to start "probing" for walls, but then the whole challenge of the game is lost.

Childrens' game. Ingenious board design, reminds me of Chateau Roquefort. The goal is to navigate your pawn to a target location on the board. Your pawn is dragging a metal ball below the board, which drops if you hit an underlying wall, requiring you to go back to your starting corner.

A ideia é muito boa, a produção é magnífica, os componentes são do melhor e o artwork também não está mau… O pior é mesmo a jogabilidade, porque se não podia ser mesmo um colosso! Dado para quê?!

Good original game. Nice combo of luck and skill, and having the maze be invisible is just great.  Btw, if you're all feeling a bit tired or you've got newbie players, you can use the spare maze walls to put on _top_ of the maze to indicate known walls to reduce the memory burden. And, of course, magnets are always cool!

When I commented about [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=264&Itemid=1]Zauberwald[/url][/i], I said that the problem with that game is that once you have figured out the paths, there is no more game. [i]The Magic Labyrinth[/i] solves this issue with modular walls, making an ever changing web of ways of infinite replay value.  [i]The Magic Labyrinth[/i] is a love child from [i]Zauberwald[/i] and [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=74&Itemid=1]The Amazeing Labyrinth[/url][/i], in which players try to reach for objects avoiding invisible walls. The player that first reaches five objects wins the game.  It uses a clever mechanism to "create" the invisible walls, using magnets, metal little balls and a structure of wooden sticks under the board.

RATING: 6
Who ever knew roll and move could be fun. Scratch that - who ever knew roll and move AND memory could be fun? And also non-trivial for adults. Drei Magier Spiele achieves this in their usual way - with nice illustrations and magnets. Duh. 

You are playing a young mage apprentice trying to find a way though an invisible maze (hidden under the board) to collect items before other mages get to them. And when your metal ball bumps into a hidden wall and falls down, oops, back to start. 

Turns out, memorizing paths isn't easy, and when you finally manage to map your own little quadrant of the board, you realise that of course, you weren't really paying attention to those invisible walls other people were bumping into. The die works well (it's 1,2,2,3,3,4) in that sometimes you really don't want to be too fast, maybe you'll remember it by next turn, or somebody runs through you and bumps into something so you don't have to. The best is when you don't have all the players as that makes items in the missing player's quadrant quite a challenge to reach. (Seriously we would play a game with 3 players for 15 minutes not getting anywhere after the first item, then a 4th player jumps in and we finish the while game in 10 minutes). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Played twice with 3P. A children's game with a really neat gimmick of implementing an 'invisible' maze using magnets. Memory skills are a necessity in this game as players will have to remember where the walls are. However, to balance things out, there's also quite a bit of luck needed in the dice rolls and the appearance of symbols to be captured. Some symbols are particularly frustrating as players have to go by trial and error to find the correct path to reach it.

I gave this to my nieces/nephews for Christmas (ages 5,6,8). They love playing the game! I recommend it as a great family game. 

House rules (some are borrowed from a Dice Tower video review on BGG):

- You MUST declare your path after you roll the die but before you move. 
This makes sure the player does not feel a wall and change their path (the little ones will always do this, lol).

- Mark walls when a player encounters them. 
We used the excess punch pieces from the maze board. But you could also use "lumber" bits from something like Settlers of Catan. When we tried to play without markers, the kids got whiny because they could never remember all the hidden walls already encountered.  After they play it a bunch, we'll take out the "training wheels" and make it a real memory game. :)

- You cannot move through or onto a field space that is already occupied by another player.  
That is, your path is blocked.  We did this because trying to move through an occupied space was causing too much havoc on the board (and revealing hidden walls not yet encountered).

- To make it easier for the little ones, a player may re-start at either (1) their own starting corner or (2) the corner where the ball dropped if not already occupied. The kids came up with this rule.

[Drei Magier Spiele 09 edition] {Magic, children; memory, toy-like; optimal 4p} {Kids 9, Adult 6} Das magische Labyrithn is a great children game - simple rules, attractive components, fun and short game time.  The use of magnetic is clever.  It's fun to watch the ball falls.  I recommend using the suggested maps for the first few games.  Then, one can build up complex maps for 2p, 3p or 4p.

The components are very nice: colorful, nice illustration and sturdy.  I love it.

Plonk, ouch! Stupito, il piccolo mago si strofina gli occhi. Ma è una muraglia quella? Gli apprendisti maghi esplorano con curiosità il labirinto magico. Per oggi c’è un compito importantissimo – la ricerca dei simboli magici! Che sarebbe anche troppo facile, se i grandi maghi non volessero continuamente giocare qualche tiro ai bambini.
Come per magia le strade si chiudono e si svelano tortuosi percorsi. Ogni giocatore cerca di superare con la sua pedina il labirinto e di collezionare per primo 5 simboli magici.

Contenuto della scatola:

Tabellone di gioco a più livelli consistente in un labirinto sotterraneo e in un piano base
24 muraglie di legno
24 gettoni con simboli magici
1 sacchetto di stoffa
1 dado con facciate con i numeri 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4
4 maghi nei colori rosso, blu, giallo e verde
4 palline di metallo

My daughter likes this game.  We let her use some of the cardboard pieces as markers to help her remember where there are walls.  IIRC the Chief (Dice Tower review) suggested this and it works well.

tl;dr: good fun memory game

I'm usually shit at memory games, but if they're spacial, like this one, I do quite well.
This game has a hidden labyrinth that you're trying to explore (and remember). This being a kids game, the rules are very simple and there is a good dose of luck, but I still enjoy the challenge.

Nagyon ötletes társasjáték, ami - mint a legtöbb gyerektársas - elsősorban a memóriát fejleszti. Nem véletlenül lett év gyerekjátéka. Szerencse van  benne, nem is kevés, hiszen a zsákból húzott kis korongok teljesen véletlesnszerűek, így előfordulhat simán, hogy a kihúzott korongok nagy része mindig ugyanazon játékos közelébe kerül. Na meg persze ott a dobókocka, ami meghatározza, hogy a játékos hányat léphet.

De mindezek ellenére nagyon jó kis játék, a szerencse szerepe teljes mértékben elviselhető, ajánlom minden kisgyermekesnek. Egy fokkal jobban tetszik, mint az elvarázsolt torony, pedig az is nagyon remek játék.

After one play, it goes into the kids game Hall of Fame.  Simple, tense, and most of all--fun to play with kids.  If kids are antsy, or not given in any way to memory exercises, it can be a bit of a drag.  

But for your money, it is hard to beat.  Rank right up there with Gulo Gulo, Chicken Cha Cha Cha, and Animal upon Animal.

Totally cool maze mechanism. I like owning kids games that also double well as drunk adult games. This one fits the bill.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1

I really can't conceive of a better kids game than this.  The components look fantastic, work beautifully, and it's easy to ratchet the difficulty level up or down.  In fact, if you play with all 24 walls, this is a challenging game for adults!

Tip: When you punch out the game, keep the skinny cardboard pieces where the walls go.  For an easier game (and less frustrating for the really little ones), you can use them to mark where the walls are at.

This game is cuter than it has any right to be.  The idea is pretty simple, and the execution, while rife with randomness, is still a lot of fun to play.  Those with good memories will school those who don't, but even if you're losing, it's fun to groan when you find that invisible wall you were SURE wasn't there.

The little magician apprentices have lost some objects in the magic maze. Now, they try to collect them, before the Master notices anything. However, in the maze, the little magicians always bump against invisible walls. So, they have to make their way through the maze by means of a good memory and lots of skill.

You have to move a character through the board but, you're trying to do so with a labyrinth below the first board. The character is joined with a magnetic ball, so, if you hit a wall, the ball drops and you have to start again.

This game has a neat "invisible wall" system that can be completely changed each time you play.

It plays fairly quick as long as everyone has a halfway decent memory so they don't keep running into the same walls over and over again.

We usually put down two markers so getting a lucky nearby draw isn't as unbalancing.

The board (or rather the framework underneath) does feel a bit fragile though, so if kids are playing this they definitely need to be supervised so nothing gets smashed.

Fantastic game that should win the KSdJ. It has a lot of luck, given that you both roll a die for movement, and draw the magical symbols from a bag, but damn is it fun! The tension as you cross a wall hoping that you remember correctly is awesome!

I highly recommend this game.

Edit: I lowered my rating to 7, but still enjoy the game. We have now setup the advanced maze, and I look forward to try it and then to experiment with our own mazes.

Much like "The Amazeing Labyrinth" the concept here is simple and fun making a great family game.  Unfocused folks (and small children) can get easily frustrated trying to remember where all the darn walls are, but folks who are up for a tough memory challenge should really enjoy this.  Also, if you use some method for marking the walls after you bump into them (like the punch outs from the maze board) this can easily be played with children as young as three.

Rated 9 with our no-dice variant : just move as far as you can until you reach the symbol. If your ball drops, your pawn goes back to the corner where it started and it's next player's turn. If you reach the symbol, draw a new one and play again. It makes the game shorter, less luck-dependant and much more dynamic!

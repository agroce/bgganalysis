Grew up playing trick-taking games online and at family gatherings. I've always loved the gamble when choosing a card. This captures that perfectly for 2p plus adds powers that provide some hilarious situations. Bravo Mr. Almes, this is your best yet!

A two-player trick-taking game.  That's a rare old thing.  Here, in a style reminiscent of For Sale, you spend the first half of the game building up a hand to use in the second half of the game.  Unlike For Sale the cards in the two halves are identical.  So it is a round of trick-taking to determine your hand for a round of trick-taking.

Mix in a bunch of suits all with special powers and you're away.

It worked OK for me, nothing more.

Claim is a 2-player trick-taking game. Being that I enjoyed Fox in the Forest, I was really looking forward to this one. It had an interesting premise where each suit had something unique about it. I also thought it was neat that you play a hand of tricks to acquire cards for the next hand of tricks. The second set of tricks (which you have essentially drafted) allows you to fight for majority of each of the suits and whoever has majority in most suits will win. In practice, I didn't really like this game. First, I didn't really like how in the first phase of the game, the loser of a trick got a random card from the deck. I understand that if the visible card a player is trying to draft is good, you should go for it, and if it's bad you should try to lose. I still didn't really like this. The greater problem for me was the memory element of what's already been played. Maybe that's great for people who like to count cards, but I certainly didn't find it enjoyable. In the end, Fox in the Forest is a great 2-player trick-taking game and one that's easily cobbled together with other numbers&suits games with a player aid. Where as, Claim basically needs a Claim deck to be played and is not that enjoyable.

Claim is a fast playing 2 player only trick taking game which plays in two phases. In the first phase you try to win tricks for the hand of cards you'll play in the second phase. One is visible and you can choose to try to win that one, or try to lose it if you can, and have a secret card from the top of the deck. Moves are quite forced unless you have a Doppelganger so you may not have as much control as you like. In the second phase you use the cards you've just won to win [i]more[/i] tricks but this time trying to win faction (suit) majorities. The person to control 3 factions wins.

I liked this one because of the two phases of play which is different to any other game we've played plus the art by The Mico was awesome as always! It doesn't have as much maneuverability as The Fox in the Forest so I like that one better, but there are still minor things you can do to manage your hand, with a couple of special powers in the mix. My gaming partner thinks it's too luck dependent, and is always complaining about his rubbish cards, but I've won every game so either he is bad at managing his hand, or I am just brilliant! :D I do agree that there is less control in this game though. In any case, we have lots of card games that we both enjoy so I didn't press the issue, but between Blend Coffee Lab and this one we're not having a lot of luck with trick taking games, and it has me wondering if I might have been too hasty axing The Fox in the Forest from my collection. Come back Fox! All is forgiven! 

TL;DR It was quick, it was fun enough, I'd totally play it again, but we have a LOT of card games and we like them all better, even if they aren't trick takers.

This 2 player trick taking game works very well. The first half is a bit random but fun. The second half is where it gets really interesting and every card counts. I'm surprised by how much I like the game.

Claim is a two player implementation of a trick taking game. To make it work with two, Claim separates the game into two phases and offers special, albeit used sparingly,  abilities with each of the five suits. Players begin with half of the deck and take tricks to gain their hand for the second phase. That is, with each trick, the winner gets a face up card and the loser receives a random card form the deck. This is a good alternative to bidding number of tricks. Decisions here are whether to fight to win the displayed card, or to lose and take your chances with the deck draw. Additionally, in phase two, the winner is determined by who has the majority of taken cards/tricks from each of the five suits. Claim is simple and quick. At about a 15 minute play, enough strategy is there where it captures the ebb and flow of trick taking nicely. When to seize control and continue to lead each trick drives the key decision. For a two player trick taker, Claim does it very well.

Trick taking designed for two players? Well done, Mr. Almes, well done!

RATING: 8
FIRST IMPRESSION:

I found this to be the best two player trick taker out there - at least at this point. The two hands played really are quite interesting as you play a trick taking round to build your hand for the second trick taking hand where most of your supporters will come (except perhaps the undead who may jump to your scoring pile in the first hand). The different abilities/modifications of the different fantasy races create some very interesting decisions.

RATING: 6.5
If you want a good 2-person trick taker, I would choose this one over The Fox in the Forest. Takes a game or two to wrap your mind around the different faction powers, as well as the two phase game, but worth trying it out if you really like trick-taking games. How did the game designer think up these rules? Quite unique. I like the game art as well.

Very interesting cardgame for 2 with 2 phases.  Not many thrick taking games for 2 !
Easy to learn but hard to handle the 1st time. This certainly needs more plays before you see all the strategic layers.
Great artwork and beautiful linnen finished cards. (every numbered card in one faction has its own character :-) )

Card game that lets you think hard for a, to my opinion, random game. 
Nevertheless, an original trick taking game for 2 players (not so many exist)
Cards feel and look good.

Claim is lovely. Building your hand the first round for the next is both clever and fun. And it's simple but not too simple. The game does have its random elements (which card shows up when), but I must admit that I like that. Utterly worth the small damage it caused to my wallet. Oh, and the artwork is awesome!

The first round feels weird playing for a known card or a random card. Second round weirdly starts with closed hands while you can just cardcount to exactly know your opponent's hand. Not interesting enough, plenty better traditional 2 player card games.

Really neat little trick-taking game for 2. 
Got to know this pretty much back to back with Fox in the Forest and actually prefer this one. The concept of playing for the cards of the second round in the first round is really interesting. 
The Dopplegangers are a bit hard to get used to when you're very familiar with classic trick taking games, as they break rules of having to follow suit, but once the powers get a bit more intuitive this is a very cool 2 player trick-taking game that actually works.

[b]Claim[/b] was acquired in a trade (1/19/18).

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]Inside of a year we've now had two excellent 2p trick taking games get released, Fox in the Forest being the other. Fox in the Forest is definitely heavier than Claim; I would compare Claim to Coloretto in terms of the depth of decision making and playtime. A game of Fox in the Forest is typically 20 to 30 minutes, you can play a round of Claim in 10 minutes. Yet despite that there is definitely more going on in Claim than it may seem at first. 

The rules are simple to learn/teach and luck may seem to play a prominent role at first. However; there is an underlying depth to the game that isn't apparent after only a couple of plays and unfortunately I think some folks will dismiss Claim because of this. There are enough twists in Claim that will prevent you from playing this game like a traditional trick taker. Having high cards is not always a benefit [i](see the dwarves)[/i] and the addition of a suit that can always be played adds a much needed wrinkle to the game.  

I would highly recommend Claim, especially if you are a fan of Fox in the Forest. Claim offers a different take on the emerging 2p trick taking genre and is a little less of a brain burner. Usually we play a best of three, which at most will take a 1/2 hour. The art is also fantastic and even if the theme is tacked on, I am glad it is there. I also hope Claim sees broader US distribution soon, maybe Renegade will pick it up.[/i]

Another two player trick taking game, this time your first hand helps you collect cards and then your second hand gives you points. In the first hand a card is drawn and in standard trick taking mechanics the winner gets the card for the next hand while the opponent gets a random card. The second hand is played with the won stacks and you simply play to win sets. Each suit has a special power that gives a little variety however the basics decide most of the game. The random card received by the loser in the first round is kind of frustrating as it requires no skill and could be great or terrible, the randomness in this instance bothered me. Otherwise the game is fairly basic, the powers add little and trick taking at two is not really fun.

Oh my god...why do I keep getting Scott Almes games? Claim is interesting enough in theory with the two rounds of trick-taking where the first round's results become your second round deck but it's so bare-bones feeling and boring. I like the art and appreciate that as the cards go up in value the creatures change (why can't every game do this?) but it still feels like playing with a standard deck of cards. Fox In The Forest isn't my favorite game in the world but in comparison to Claim it's a masterpiece.

[White Goblin Games 2017 Edition] {Fantasy; trick-taking; 2p} The special flow of this 2p trick-taking game is a two-phase approach.  At first phase, players uses the dealt cards to win a hand of 13 cards (using trick-taking).  Then, they used the collected 13 cards in first phase to have another trick-taking round to win cards for scoring.  5 functions alter the trick-taking and scoring slightly.

It is a good game balancing luck of draw and tactics.  Good memory certainly helps here.

The illustration is cute.

RATING: 8
Good, fast playing, simple to explain yet hard to master trick-taking game. And it even has some theme.

It is basically two games in half: 52 cards, shuffle well, divide your deck in half, and then divide a half to give 13 cards to each player. The 26 remaining are basically the cards you claim during the first part of the game with trick taking (winner takes the open card, loser takes the next one from the top). 

The resulting stack of 13 cards you use to win tricks and take the cards home to get the most of a faction. Win three factions, win the game. One game lasts about 10-15 minutes.

The beauty in the game is the variable number and values of each faction, the 'hidden info' introduced during the first part of the game to counter card counting, and the variable power of each faction. Undead score immediately to the winner during the first part, knights always beat goblins regardless of value, dwarves go to te loser during the second round, and doppelgangers allow you to break the 'follow suit' game rule of trick taking.

Turning the game into a back-and-forth guessing of the cards in each players' hands and making each move relevant.

Highly enjoyed this game. Well designed, nicely presented and friendly priced. Can be played with gamers and non-gamers alike (though a good explanation is needed in that case). Glad I own it.

This is a very clever game. After Fox in the Forest I was happy to see yet another trick-taking game for 2 players only being released.

The simple rules disguise some great hidden depth. The first game may appear quite random, but with each play you start to realise there is actually quite a lot to think about here. 

Fantastic. More 2 player trick-taking games please!

I really like Claim. It reminds me of the card games I played when I was younger. It´s competitive and you want to play it again and again. It´s a clever game. I hope Claim 2 (coming in 2018) will allow for more than 2 players to play the game together. In any case, I´m sure to buy it when it comes out to add more variablitity to the game (bring on more factions, yay!). And the artwork is awesome by The Miko as usual. Maybe the cards could have been a little bit bigger (they seem small).

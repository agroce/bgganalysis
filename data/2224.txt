If you are in the mood for beer and pretzels, this game satisfies your thirst.  Once Circus Maximus arrives, I may never play this again.

Very dated.  This may have been an accepable game in the 80's - but not in the 21st century (which is when I played the game, without the benefit of any nostalgic appeal).  The 'frenzy' was just too powerful and the game just a lottery.

Very good game! You can do almost everything in the arena... The only bad thing IMHO are the poor materials... with good miniatures it would be a great game!

Perhaps the most brutal chariot-racing game out there. I finally acquired this longtime Grail of mine after first playing it at Dragonflight in Seattle. My longterm plan is to collect a few 15mm chariot miniatures to maximize this great gaming experience.

Oh the horror of old school Ameritrash.  Too much downtime, but at least it was a race game with lots of carnage!  I cam in second place, but only because everyone but the winner and I were toast!!!

Whip the beasts.  The flavor text and rulebook are a blast.  If you go into it with the idea that you are there to have fun over winning, its a great time. 
It also depends on the group you have playing.. people can really make this game fun.

RATING: 7.5
I'm a sucker for chariot games. This game was a hoot. It is far more bloody than Circus Maximus (one of my favorites) and there is a GREAT deal more randomness, but that should be expected going in. I thoroughly enjoyed it, though Circus Maximus is slightly more dear to me. Two different takes on the same genre.

Okay, so I have to bump up the rating.  I don't want to play this all the time, but the few times I have it has been excellent.  There really isn't much downtime in the game as I am always into everything else that is going on. 

I also find this one of the few games that I play the theme.  I could try and go slow and safe, but that wouldn't be glorious would it?

The miniatures that were apparently made for this game make this an easy four star production.

My favorite chariot racing game.  Not too complex, but not too simple.  It is always tempting to whip your beasts, but you don't want to send them into a frenzy.  This game is a lot of fun for all involved.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is what Circus Maximus looks like with a sense of humor. Yes, there's book-keeping, and yes, there is some "chaos" involved, and, yes, the game takes more than 30 minutes to play. If you can't handle that, I'm sure there are some lonely meeple out there that need a hug. Otherwise, this one is a riot. Really needs at least 4 racers to be truly entertaining, and the more crowded the field the better. It's all about the Beasties....

RATING: 7
Game of futuristic chariot racing set in FASA's Renegade Legion universe.  The anti-grav chariots are pulled by slavering beasts.  Lots of fun.  I won a game once with my chariot driver being dragged across the finish line, entagled in the reins!  This game is good with lots of players.  Great convention game.

One of my all-time favourite RPGs!

Based unashamedly on the chariot race in Ben Hur, Circus Imperium injects a few sci-fi themes and a huge dose of tongue-in-cheek humour to make this an enormously enjoyable gaming experience.  The rule book is one of the most entertaining ever written and the cut out and glue scenery is well worth making.  A couple of alternative fold-out tracks allows you to choose between a quick thrash around the circuit or a more involved marathon chariot Grand Prix. 

This hugely enjoyable game is often available for a few Euros in French bargain emporia such as Noz. Highly recommended!

Violent race game inspired by Circus Maximus set in the future but allows you to do some crazy stuff like jump onto someone else's chariot or have you beasts (not horses) maul some idiot in the track. Sadly it shows it's age as it take forever to play.

Used to have a lot of fun with this and a few beers, so I've rated it high for nostalgia rather than it's merits as a game.  Sadly, the copy got lost over the course of years.  Never again will I whip a mutant death-lion until it turns on me in the middle of a corner and causes a pile-up that ends in a bloody sword fight, only for the victor to be creamed by an out of control, empty chariot :(

I love this game.  It's always a hit at cons, and when a large group of friends get together.  They don't even have to be drunk to get laughing.  This is what I call a party game.

Great game to play with friends, especially if they shout the "boys in the bend" lines when they are supposed to.  Rules are fast and fun, and games can get intense when your driver gets knocked out of his chariot and then gets squashed while trying to jump into another.

It may be odd for someone to rate this game a 10, but everytime I have had a group of people play this game it was a fun time for most everyone!  It is really only fun if you have over four people playing however.

Played again and it is FUN!!!!! 12/9/2014!  Rated an 8.  Downgraded to be reasonable.

An improvement over Circus Maximus, but not by much, and not in all areas.  Like other FASA SF games, the units are too durable to fit the theme, and the rules load isn't worth the final result (though the former can be somewhat mitigated by crossing off shields before play).  Nice components for the era, though -- especially that ludicrously complex papermodel building set in the middle of the track.

This was a fun game with lots of laughs. In the first game I played, my beasts frenzied on the very 1st whip card I pulled & I spent the rest of the game trashing my chariot, & boarding 2 others. Almost killing the 1st guy before he cut his beasts loose & bailed out, leaving me on foot again, & throwing the 2nd guy out of his chariot & zooming off with it. I still lost, but it was a lot of fun.

Circus Imperium is a very very very special game to me. I was one of the last remaining employees of FASA interactive when Microsoft shut us down last summer. Every winter old FASA members get together and play this game for our coveted Colin Powell Trophy. It's the last remaining bit of culture from our studio. Getting together every year to play this reminds us on how much we loved working together at the best job any of us have ever had. 
THIS WAS ONE OF MY GIFTS FROM MY 2007 SECRET SANTA!!!! THANKS AGAIN SANTA!!!

I have never played a session of this without me laughing myself silly with enjoyment. A little hard to find, but if you do I would highly recommend it. Player elimination, dice rolls, tons of luck, and gang up on the leader: all things that make Ameritrash great.

Waaah! I wanted to like this game so much. I love Circus Maximus, and thought chariots with monsters would be cool. The rules are clunky and don't capture the quick n' dirty feel I thought the game should have embraced.

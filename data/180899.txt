RATING: N/A
Interesting idea of avoiding causing the game to end by going bankrupt. The rondel that you can use to plan ahead (and conversely, exploit your opponent's moment of weakness) is a neat addition. The core question though is the same as in Neue Heimat; can you price an asset (in this instance, the colored chevron pieces) so that someone else pays you for them or get theirs on the cheap. Much like many econ games, this is dependent upon having an equally savvy group to really shine (and when you do, it comes off well) because of the "first to go bankrupt" pillar requires everyone to do what they can to survive as you sort of grind it out (thus sort of reducing chevron trading prices) until, like in Pax Porfiriana w/ the toppels, it finally gives way and the game ends. Need more plays to get a better idea on just how little is to retain chevrons vs extending the game (and how important extending the game is comparatively). Definitely willing to play again, but not sure it's my first choice in similar games.

This is a wonderfully opaque economic rollercoaster. Like those charity booths where you put a coin in and watch it spiral down into the pot. Except the coins are players and they're all saying "Gravity? What gravity? I'm fine mate, I can keep this going forever"

An absolute blast with the right group. Based on my current tastes I can't see this ever leaving my collection, even if I only get to play it on occasion. Awesomely fresh design.

Bought from Boarders during my first visit to there. 

Had my first game on 13th Mar 2017 with some really serious board gamer. In turns out the winning condition makes the game wasn't really enjoyable. However on financial planning part it's challenging and calculative. Dealing part is also an art to sell away your house at best pricing.

It's all about surviving. It wasn't as good as my first impression on it, but it's definitely good for it's theme.

1st play: Trying to keep your head above water when you know everyone is doomed to fail is tricky. Clandestine trading is the high point of the game and there's a delicious feeling when you know someone is over a barrel and then you make them an offer they can't refuse. Watching them squirm while knowing that in a turn or two you'll be in the same situation and hoping they go bankrupt before you. 

2nd play: Just as good as last time, except the purchasing of luxury goods isn't really fun and takes away from clandestine actions. I prefer the basic rules here. Plays perhaps better with 5, but 4 is solid. Quick game that doesn't overstay its welcome.

Many plays: This is SUCH an elegant design, and one of the best games of the decade. The rules are so simple, and the game is so self contained, and EVERY single thing you do in this game matters. It is SO thematic, because the players set the value for everything, and when the money is hidden, it causes a level of paranoia and group think that you need to see to believe. 

Really a superb design, it is tight and clever and fun as hell. The hidden money and clandestine deals are what makes it tick, otherwise it would more more or less solvable I think. As it is, it produces lots of hilarious swings and hopeful calculations as you try to be as greedy as possible while guessing when the house of cards is finally going to fall down. The interplay in the deals phase is deeper than it seems at first too. Who to target, what to offer, and what industry type to offer on can seriously impact both your and your target's next round, because the amount of money you are able to get next round depends on what tiles you have in front of you (e.g. if someone has 3 tiles in 3 industries and 2 in another, if they acquire a third in that final industry they are unable to take a loan the next turn which means you can really turn the knife). Super fun, and moves pretty quickly, highly recommended.

Ponzi Scheme is essentially a game of chicken.  Keep taking on loans that you will sooner or later need to pay interest on and hope that some other sucker goes bankrupt before you do.  You are taking loans to buy shares in businesses.  Beyond the third share these can only be acquired through deals with other players.  I like the accept an offer or double it system for these deals.  The game is light on rules and high on tension and hilarity, a nice ratio.  The only doubt in my mind is how many plays it has in it.

Production quality of the Homosapiens Lab edition  is very good.  The artwork is nothing special.

Very interesting. Almost immediately you realize you are going to bust someday - so it's just how long can you survive? One issue - if another player misplays, that can really set up the other players. Not being able to predict the end game can definitely be interesting. Overall - I really like the 'make a deal' mechanic.

Thematically strong, with an interesting confidential offer mechanic, and distinctive game end conditions (one or more players go bankrupt!), this is simply not a game I particularly enjoy playing, which suggests, I guess, that I don't particularly enjoy participating in ponzi schemes, which seems about right.

RATING: 6
I like light economic games, and this is an original and interesting take on the genre. The rules couldn't be more simple: you take on loans with outrageously high deferred interest payments, acquire stock certificates, and make deals to buy and sell stock with other players. The only way to pay the interest on your current loans is to get new loans, leading eventually to an avalanche of doom that WILL make you go bankrupt, the only question is when. The game ends when somebody goes bust and the winner with the most valuable stock portfolio is declared from those still solvent. Much tension, much amusement, much player interaction. The reason I probably won't seek this game out again is that it doesn't seem there's enough public information to feel like you're in control of the outcome - in the end it left me feeling I'd had an (admittedly enjoyable) experience rather than played a strategic game.

Wow! Ponzi Scheme is unlike any other game I've played so far. Unique theme and playing mechanism (at least to my knowledge). Never has a race to the bottom been so much fun... this is amazingly stressful in a good way! 

I loved the under-the-table trading with the leather "wallet," and watching my opponents saw off the branches they were sitting on. My favorite moment? Watching everyone scramble for quick cash once the bull market was inevitable. I can't wait to play this again (and watch my competitors go bankrupt, haha).

Short economic game with a funny premise - everyone is losing money, but the person who can survive the eventual bankruptcy with the most stuff wins. Take on loans to pay loans. Sell stuff to pay loans. Buy stuff for less than market value from other players who need to pay loans. Purchase luxuries and suck money out of the ecosystem. Take on more loans. Go bankrupt.

Unfortunately, paper money is required to make the game work (secret trades), and that slows the game down quite a bit. With poker chips, you could play it in 30 minutes.

Played 2 3 player games with Flo and my sister. Super fun but extremely cutthroat game. The whole deal making is the basis to winning the game. Knowing when to offer a super lowball deal or when to make it higher is key.

A very interactive game, that does offer some interesting choices.  The paper money in the TMG edition is awful, but they wanted it to fit in the fancy wallet, so I get the decision, but it was still annoying.

Something I would play again for sure, but I don't think it was worth all the hype it got when it first came out.

A very strange, but good, money management game!

Each turn, you have the option of getting into a ponzi scheme, which is the only way of getting money in the game. The scheme will earn you a certain amount of money up front, but you're going to have to pay back on it every so many turns, depending on the scheme. So, you might get $20 now, but have to pay $13 every 4 turns for the rest of the game. Along with the scheme you get a piece of real estate.

Then players take turns offering money to buy real estate from other players. The super neat thing, however, is that this offer is completely secret. You put money in an envelope and hand it to the player you're offering to. They can either accept it and give you the real estate, or match your offer to buy that same real estate from you.

As the game goes on, you'll be involved in more and more ponzi schemes trying to float your empire, until someone eventually gets in too deep and goes broke. At this point, the scoring is based on real estate owned.

The game had a strange feel to it in that I never felt like I knew how well I was doing, or what a good offer might be, given than so much of the cash transfer from player to player is done in secret. Did that real estate just sell for $15 of $50? It was fun at the end of the game discussing what went on, as players had wildly different ideas of what a fair price was!

Overall, just a very unique and well-done game. However, the more I play it, the more the novelty wears off, and the less excited I am to play, even though I'm still usually happy to play it if others suggest it.

Quick loans and shares game for up to 5 players. Components are nice but the art just fell flat for me. I'm not a big fan of financial games so it didn't particularly interest me. At least the playing time is fairly short so I could be convinced to play if I was in the right mood.

RATING: 8
Such a super interesting game. The system of money coming in to the economy creating such crippling debt, and this meaning just trying to survive until someone goes bust is the right level of stress. Also, not knowing who might go bust or what money anyone has makes it super tense. The bidding system, for Stock,  reminds me of Isle of Skye. I just don't know what price people are willing to pay for stocks, but I would love to explore more with people that also don't know what anything is worth. 
I would love to own this game even though I have no idea who I would play it with.

De  lightful. What a great theme! It is so much fun trying to keep a house of cards standing just a little bit longer that everyone else. Trying to actually win the game while things are spiraling out of control makes it even crazier. The bribery system is perfect, and there is real skill in reading the table and making the best bids. 

My only complaints are that for what it is, it can be drawn out as bribes are sent around. And that it is slightly more complicated than I would feel comfortable playing with my non-gamer people. Which is a shame because the feel is so perfect for those kinds of groups.

An interesting game where players compete to try to build up industry by taking bad loans with the hope that they can push off going bankrupt longer than at least one other player. The game ends when someone goes bankrupt and then points are awarded for the industries remaining players have built. A key aspect for the game is also making secret bids to other players to buy their industry tiles but doing so without knowing how much money every player has. It's a tough and slightly stressful experience trying to determine what to do on secret bids - take the money or counter for twice. The rules are easy to explain, the number of decisions are small but the impact is deep. It does seem that more players will lead to more interesting games given the nature of the secret bids. I would recommend this game and I would play it again.

This game does a wonderful job making you feel like your running a Ponzi scheme. By your second influx of money, you're already sweating bullets about how you're going to pay back your investors.

And there's wonderful player interaction in offering to trade shares in companies -- trying to guess what offer is one they can't refuse, especially if you know they are short on cash.

Finally, the end-game is brilliant... first player that goes bankrupt ends the ends the game. But wait! You're not ready to end the game, so you have offer a favorable deal for that player to keep afloat.

To achieve all these great moments, the game does have somewhat contrived rules, but the theme comes across so strong, I'm willing to overlook them.

Delightful "party" game where players walk a financial tightrope, trying to stay in the black and let someone else go bust first.  Players invest in short term/high risk ventures, taking in a one-off payment, however each of these are time bombs that will go off several turns down the track.  Off the charts production, and a very funny, nerve-wracking game.  I loved it.

RATING: 7
Really really clever, but I find it difficult to estimate the value of the industry tiles.  The central strategic element of at what rate and form (horizontal vs. vertical) hinges on your estimation of when someone will go bankrupt, and that is impossible to know.  I feel like there needed to be one less layer or a little more open information so that the wonderful central conceit of the the inevitable collapse of the system can shine rather than being obscured by the inscrutable nature of the clandestine deals.

The game represents the theme very well, but I think it is too out of control to be fully enjoyed.

RATING: 8
It's short and has a lot of swingy uncertainty.   The game is almost sure to end when you don't want it to.    The tension of trying not to be the first player to go bankrupt works well against the need to spend money for points (to win).   You have to take some chances.   All of that gave the game life for me, and it felt fresh.

Like most TMG productions, the game is dark and super-saturated with ink.  Somehow, TMG doesn't understand the physical production, or they just don't care.   The player aid is grey on grey and impossible to read.

RATING: 8.5
Ponzi Scheme is unlike ANYTHING out in the market place right now.  It takes me back to the early days of Euro-gaming when, in the mid 1990s, games (called German Games back then) were all about simple rule sets and a huge chunk of interaction.  
  
So, in this economic game of few rules you are taking industry cards which you are collecting in sets, and you take loans which you use for secret clandestine deals to get industry tiles off other people.  Or, if your offer is too low, they can throw the offer back at you and get one of your industry cards.   Those loans accrue a large interest payment a number of rounds in the future.  And so each round your forthcoming debt liabilities grow and grow.  Slowly but surely you sink under an ever-mounting relentless pile of debt.  You never pay a loan off but the interest comes around again and again.  The game ends when someone goes bankrupt.  Your main aim is to not go bankrupt first, and after that it is to have the most developed industry of the remaining players.  But, and here’s the rub, the more industry tiles you get the more you probably have been paying other players for them in secret deals and so the more debt you are taking on and so the more interest you owe and so the more likely you are to go bankrupt.  Oh the joys of balancing this baby.

The game has this incredible tension and flow.  You are trying your best to screw your opponent, kicking them when they are down if possible, in order to get the best deal for some of their industry, and doing this in the hope that it doesn’t backfire right in your face.   And backfire it sure will do at some stage.  You start to need some big loans to pay off your interest, but the bigger the loan the higher the interest rate and the more loans you need...oh how well this simulates the whole house of cards nature of a ponzi scheme.

But the joy is that this mini-festival of mind-games, manipulation, debt and stress has a healthy dose of great table-humour thrown in as you all sink together and try and get away with offering each other such ridiculous deals.

Sadly Ponzi Scheme won’t be widely available due to the Publisher being from South East Asia.  I hope that one day it will get picked up and get the distribution it so richly deserves.
This is unlike ANYTHING I have ever played before. The game has hardly any rules yet is the most tense economic game I have ever played.  It is so simple yet so clever.  Like a good ponzi scheme you are having to borrow more and more money to pay off the interest on your relentless debt.  All you can hope for is that you won't be first to go bankrupt.  And whilst this is happening you are trading industries with other players in clever clandestine deals with envelopes full of cash.  The aim being that, at the point when someone does go bankrupt, you want to have the best industrial strength. But to get that you have to pay your competitors more money, which takes you closer to bankruptcy. 

Oh boy, this game is simply brilliant.  Mind-games, group think, table banter...all the elements of a tremendously involved game are all here.  

And it's over in an exhausting yet exhilarating hour or so.

輪盤的設計很簡約，然而破產直接算輸（而非扣分）這點相當破壞遊戲體驗，也讓玩家的策略變得很消極、單調。暗盤交易機制是有趣的，但每輪只能進行一次，限制了拿大資金打爆發的策略。此外，產業沒有屬性差異，於是它只變成(1)要跟哪些玩家捉對、(2)融資資格，的象徵物（偏偏物業堆高後的融資並無明顯優勢，除非有付不出利息以外的call game條件），這也頗可惜。

做錯事的懲罰遠大於做對事情的獎勵，導致玩完的心情並不愉快，也沒什麼智識上的成就感（本遊戲考驗的是觀察力），這是賣掉它的主因。

This is a game of walking the financial high wire whereby you must take on more loans to pay off your current loans. There's no paying them off (Ponzi, ya know).  Eventually, someone will bust and the game ends. Only those players who did not bust may count their VPs and see who won. VPs are gained by collecting sets of chits. 

Each turn you may make a predatory offer to someone for one of their chits. Either they accept your money and give you their chit or they pay you what you offered – and take one of yours! It’s viciously fun. And during the early part of the game, the turns sing with players trash-talking each other and chits flying back and forth on the table. This is when the game is at its best. 

Later in the game, the proceedings turn into more of a math battle with calculators on the table as players compute how much they can afford to offer someone vs keep in reserve. Fortunately, this only lasted a couple rounds and then the game ended. Too much calculation and the game dries up. Definitely an every-now-and-then game for me, but very effective at what it sets out to do.

Simple enough to be too simple....basically stay one step ahead of the rest of the players and gather cash or investment tiles until one person makes a mistake.

I was a bit sceptical that something as simple and, well, boring (from a finance-theoretical vantage point) as the Ponzi scheme would be a good base for an interesting game. I needn't have worried. The game is largely one of bullshitting and gambling on the other players' demise. It is certainly no exact science, but it's a highly interactive excursion into high finance with just a minimal corset of rules.

Somewhat overproduced for what should really be a small card game but very entertaining nonetheless.

This is not my sort of game, but it is a very clever game. If you like Modern Art, you'll like this. On your turn there are a variety of investments available to you. You want to play so as to have a wide rang available. However they are of differing values, and how much they're worth to you changes depending on how long the game is going to last, and of course whether they will win the game for you. It's a complete brainburner, trying to evaluate the best tiles. The paranoia sets in in the first round and is maintained until the cataclysmic end.

If you've ever put £50 on the black on a roulette table just for kicks, you'll enjoy this game.

Build your business empire by promising impossibly high returns to your investors. When it’s time to pay, accept even bigger investments with even more impossible returns, until someone goes spectacularly bust. The biggest business mogul still standing wins.

The rules are fairly straightforward, and the skill in the game is pitching your secret trade deals well. It's a lot about timing - especially when you start betting hard on whether someone's about to go broke.

Sure, some people find it stressful to be constantly barrelling towards inevitable bankruptcy. But I've found plenty of analytically-minded gamers who agree with me that this game is excellent.

Extremadament sencill, té poques opcions, gairebé podria ser un filler de Knizia... No recomanable ni per probarlo.

Ponzi Scheme is a game of valuation and negotiation. Despite the players buying stocks, it's really not a stock holding game. The stocks don't vary in value based on the market, you simply get more points the more you have, kind of like the scoring in Coloretto. 

The big hook with the game is that in order to get these stocks (and get money), you need to take out investments that are all very bad in the long term. Eventually you will have to pay back more than you borrowed, and you will do this by taking out even bigger loans with an even worse rate of return. The game finally ends when this catches up with someone who goes bankrupt and is eliminated regardless of how many stocks he/she owns. It's even possible for several players to be eliminated at once and I've heard stories of people winning the game simply by being the only non-bankrupt player even though they had very few points. This aspect is reminiscent of the end of games like High Society and Cleopatra and the Society of Architects.

But my favorite part of the game is the Clandestine Trades that occur. Once per turn, each player has the option to make a secret offer of money (passed in a leather wallet) to another player. This amount represents an offer to buy a stock from that player. That player then has a choice. He can either take the money, giving up his stock OR he can match the amount of money in the wallet and pass it back, stealing a stock from the offerer. So a player who makes an offer will either end up stealing a stock (points) or getting money but losing a stock. In practice, a sharp player will notice when an opponent is desperate for money and will accept a very low offer as well as noticing when a player is desperate for points and will gladly pay lots of money to you. It is almost impossible to calculate these values and I love games like this where the choices are more intuitive than calculable. 

My rating could easily go up after more plays. I find both the clandestine deals and the way in which this simulates the inevitable collapse of a Ponzi scheme to be very appealing.

Great game. Paper money is still a bug bear for me but it works so well with the wallet which is a really neat idea.

Unfortunately I think there is still enough open information for the wallet to not really have its full significance identified - it would be more interesting if there was some element of hidden/partial information about the various industries - aka stockpile. That's the only thing missing from making this a great game!!

The mechanics are otherwise brilliant and fit the theme perfectly

Neutral - on occasion

Games from Taiwan!

A game that players must go debt-on-debt, While spending money secretly to buy those worth scores at the end, one tries not to become the first one that bankrupt(by making an assessment of the financial conditions of others).

Unlike most German/Euro games, the possible ways of interactions between players are wildly opened to the players：

Pros－－ It feels pretty fresh and unlike anything before. Each game can have very different dynamics.

Cons－－ good gaming experience highly relies on players' playing style.
(1) The bad plays of one player can trigger the game-end condition. So for the game to work, it has to assume players are all keen to win, and also requires players at least avoid some apparent bad plays. What makes it worse, it's hard to judge the situation correctly, given most of the info is hidden.

(2) Players can even play negatively  as an extortion game:"I'm going to bankrupt/give that player XXX if you don't OOO..."

Conclusion: Free and wild game that is highly group dependent(for a seemingly strategy game). May be viewed as a long party game for gamers.

The game becomes easier to follow over a few rounds, but the strategies are tricky to understand. Players who prefer business themed game took an interest, the rest dragged along for the ride. I'm sorry to say the theme fell flat when the game ended, it didn't generate the thrill and excitement of Stockpile or I'm The Boss or even Black Friday.

Oh yeah, this is my wheelhouse. Unusual/dark theme that comes through in the game mechanisms. Everyone's watching to see who will go bankrupt first, and trying to prey on it. Tons of fun to see the game structure force players into seemingly terrible choices. Rules are pretty simple, how to win is not so and requires reading and sometimes bluffing other players.

Dry, impossible to calculate and control (unless you have an electronic brain) and generally uninteresting.

Presenting buy/sell offers to opponents is executed WAY better in Kuhhandel (admittedly it's a main part of Kuhhandel's mechanics and only some part of Ponzi Scheme's one).

Maybe it's a better game than my rating would indicate, but the game is _completely_ not for me.

Not bad... Thematically a little odd (i.e. why would anyone do this, with no chance of long-term success?), but a fun experience all the same.

The clandestine trade rule, while central to the game of course, does take quite a bit of time and introduces some downtime.

It feels like a heavy economic party game! The immediate sense of dread is just hilarious and permeates every second of the game. Knowing someone is eventually going down is such a weird and fresh feeling in the game. There are lots of interesting things that can happen with the stock trading that you wouldn't expect at first. Great game!

Initial Rating: 3.0 (January 2017)

I bought Ponzi Scheme by mistake, but I was expecting a good game as it is well ranked here on BGG, however I heavily disliked it.

The rules are very simple and you can explain them under 8 minutes. The game also plays very fast, you can play it under 50 minutes with fast players.

The theme is cool but I didn’t feel it very much through the game other that your business is doomed to fail. You don’t feel you are creating a Ponzi Scheme in any way.

The game´s components are good, perhaps over produced for such a simple game and for the same reason, it is an expensive game. 

I was disappointed by the decisions needed to play the game, they seem obvious. The only part I liked was the secret trading, but here lies also a BIG issue for me. If you know that you are going to bankrupt this turn, nothing stops you to give all your money to other player buying a worthless industry, thus, this is one of the worst forms of king making and I hate this. I guess this is why money gives so little VPs, but it can be enough for a player to win unfairly. There is also a lot of uncontrollable luck with the cards. Gameplay is very repetitive and boring. 

Bottom line, Ponzi Scheme is a fail for me. I already sold the game. It is obvious and simple and the king making issue it too big for me. I heavily dislike the game. There is one caveat though, I wasn’t the player who read the rules so perhaps there is a mistake somewhere, but my friend assured me we played it correctly, in which case I won’t play it again.

A delightfully sharp title in which the players must take greater and greater loans to cover their investments, and hope another player goes bankrupt the turn before they would.  Best played with a table who can play socially and seriously at the same time, as the game evokes trash talk.

RATING: 7
The rules are very simple. Every turn each player may take 1 of 4 industry tiles and a money card based on how many tiles of a type you already have. The money cards have an amount of cash you get immediately, a number of turns after which you must pay interest, and an interest payment that in many cases can be more than double the cash you received. The money that every player owes and when they owe it is public knowledge, but the amount of money every player has is secret. After getting money and tiles, each player can make a secret offer of cash for a tile of another player. The other player can accept the offer, or double the money and buy that same tile from the offering player. Either way, if there is an offer, a tile and money WILL exchange hands. Some money cards are marked with a bear and when 4 enter the market (out of 9 cards total), the time track moves twice, shortening the time window for interest payments and destroying current financial plans, as bear markets can do.

The first player who cannot afford an interest payment goes bankrupt and loses. The remaining players get points primarily from sets of industry tiles and a little bit from money. Everyone's running a scheme that will go bust, you just want to avoid being the first one while collecting as many industry tiles as you can get. Without seeing how much money exchanges hands, you only have vague information about their ability to make their payments. That's where the fun lies. What offer can I make that would interest another player? Which player? Do I want his tile or do I really want his money? How much should I offer to get what I'm looking for? If I don't get it, will I be okay? If you think these sorts of questions would interest you in a game, then Ponzi Scheme is for you!

[floatleft][ImageID=2599086][/floatleft]Ponzi Scheme is an elegant game of precarious swindling and inevitable bankruptcy. You win the game if you have the most points, which are earned by taking industry tiles in 4 different colours. For a set of N industry tiles of the same colour you score the Nth triangle number (1, 3, 6, 10, ect..). In order to take one of these tiles you must take an 'investment' card, which will give you money but cost you money (usually more than you were given) in a few turns. Want $53 bucks? No problem, you just have to pay back $75 every 3 rounds.

Sounds insane right? The trick is to take more and more of these ludicrous investments to pay off the ones you already have. It's doomed to failure and therein lies the brilliance of the game. You can see the investments your opponents have made, but not their cash on hand. The game ends when someone goes bankrupt, they lose, and the person with the most VPs wins. Your goal is to push yourself to the edge, as long as at least one other person is worse off than you.

[center][ImageID=2601050 medium][/center]

This is made more complicated because every round you have a chance to trade. You can make an offer to an opponent with the same colour industry tile as you. The offer is secretly passed, your opponent has two choices, they can either take your money and give you an industry tile, or they can pay you the amount of the offer and take one of your industry tiles. If you time your offers right you can take advantage of an opponent who has a big payday coming. But you have to be careful because if you part with too much of your money you can't fend off an opponent trying to take advantage of you. This trading creates a very fun and paranoid atmosphere as you try to figure out what offers are being made, what constitutes a good offer, and how you can come out ahead of everyone else.

The two games I played were extremely interesting and a lot of fun. Although there is strategy, I view this as more of a light super filler. Great for ending a longer game night. I don't think the game would stand up well to many repeated plays in a short period of time, but it could certainly be an occasional source of fun for many years.

This game was a big surprise. I tend to mentally downplay a lot of the non-Japanese Asian games, but that is a big mistake. Ponzi Scheme really ticks all of the boxes. It is relatively easy to teach and learn. The play time is not very long. And the theme is unique, and expressed fully through the mechanisms. I suppose if you don't have such a pessimistic view of the greed that led to the collapse of our financial markets, you might not enjoy the obvious message of this game. Or if you like to win your economic games through the sheer skill of calculation, you may come away disappointed. But for me, this game is a breath of fresh air and a true winner.

A bonus point for the ridiculously chunky wooden block that I guess is supposed to be used to store the money. It's so impractical that I love it. 

This game has the distinction of being the 2000th game I've rated here at BGG.

Fun game with a lovely theme. In order to win you have to be aggressive, but preferably not the most aggressive. It reminds me a bit of High Society in that sense. Clandestine trading is especially a cool concept, also because it makes counting others' money impossible. There is a very nice level of tension building up, but it may flatten if you realize that you are likely one to go bust. With good table talkers this will be hilarious anyway.

This is an amusing game of borrowing from Peter to pay Paul and doing this repeatedly until someone eventually goes bankrupt.  And the key word is "eventually" because the way the game is structured, you can't help but go bankrupt.  It's all just a matter of avoiding it long enough until someone else busts first.  The game requires one to make bids on tiles representing various goods - a mechanism which I don't really like in games.  As a result, I don't have an interest in playing this again though I would if others wanted to play it.

A fun game, but not sure it has enough distinct features to justify owning. It is in in that space for simple games with heavier implications, but it might a sheep made to look like it's a wolf, rather than an actual one.

It lasts a little longer than I'd want, I think if it was consistently around 45m or less that'd be fine.

It can also sometimes feel like a pretty arbitrary experience. I'm sure there's a lot of subtlety I'm missing, but it feels like the outcome comes more from multiplayer mistakes cascading, and card draw randomness, than it does from the negotiations.

Perhaps that says more about my skill in reading the negotiation side of the game, but I feel like it is understated and not as significantly the heart of the game as it should be.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

After all the hype I was looking forward to my play of this one. However, several players were too calculating and too slow which really takes much of the fun away from this one. This is supposed to be a quick playing game of taking risks and seeing where you end up. The wood money block is quite a ridiculous sight/component but I suppose it works well for the game.

So we read the manual and thought "Wait, is it just [i]that[/i]? Well, let's play it then - seems weird, though". And then someone lands on its first dividend payment and says "ok, so I pay this and remove it from my time marker, right?", "No, it stays there". "But wait, how can it work if we get to pay those amounts forever?"

Well, THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT. Ponzi Scheme is a game on which everybody is doomed to go bankrupt sooner or later, so what you try to do is being the one in a better position when someone can't pay their debts - because that is the endgame condition.

I played this only once, I rated it a 8.5, and, to be honest, I can only expect this to go higher. This game is really my cup of tea.

A very different economic game where you are encouraging investors to invest in your companies but have to pay back a lot more money later.  You will go bankrupt, but you are hoping to have other players go bankrupt before you do.  You score based on the number of similar investments you have gathered.  

After one play, I felt the game was OK.  Don't know if the game has a lot of deployability but as an interesting new theme it is a good game.

It's a pure mind game, basically it comes down to guesstimating what the other players are willing to pay for the industry tiles. It gets quite random if you play with people you don't know or cannot read.

It really is unlike anything I have played before, with very slight resemblance to Container (the guessing what stuff is worth to others).

Update: You can also play this as an extortion game. "Look I'm about to go bankrupt an he's going to win, I need $30 to survive so someone bid me that for one of my tiles". Doesn't work with every group, but it changes the dynamics of the game quite a lot.

Initial impression.  I really like this game.  In fact, given the choice among games of similar type I am likely to choose this one.  Elegant set of rules that don't stand in the way of playing.  Highly interactive.  An element of deduction and push your luck.  Truly hidden information (as opposed to memorizing).  All this conceals a deep game that is hard to master, with quickly changing table conditions, so that players keep jockeying for leadership while flirting with bankruptcy and disaster.  Mean, but good mean, the kind that makes you burst out in laughter when someone gives you a lowball offer and you admire his/her guts and shrewd play and have to accept it.  Incredible game, that once again shows that there is much to be discovered by exploring foreign games that look at things with a different perspective and bring a breath of fresh air to our hobby.  Highly thematic -- you could almost breath the smoke filled room while trying to run your boiler room and ponzi scheme for just one more round.  This is a game where the mechanics bring the theme to life.  The main challenge is finding the right gaming group for it, and the fact that it is a demanding game, so it won't see the table as often as it deserves.

The mechanics in the game doesn't have a good match with the Ponzi Scheme.

Not to mention that every time you play the game, the strategy and scenarios will be almost exactly the same. The replayability is low.

Somewhat on the fence for the time being.  An interesting game with plenty of interactive mechanics and a "meta" that feels like a freight train accident going in slow motion.  My biggest concern is the hidden "bidding" since you can easily undervalue or overvalue something due to absolutely no information to work with.

I might try it again, but I prefer Modern Art for my bidding and screwing other players over.

RATING: N/A
Pros: Thematic, easy to teach, learn and play, strong economic appeal
Cons: Player screen is not very big and handling money behind it can be a little bit fiddly; there might be some downtime on other players turn when pondering about trades. The game can also end suddenly and that's something you can't plan for. You can be careful and not to take too many loans, but you probably won't end up winning either.
Overall it's a game that I enjoy playing once in a while, but not good enough to keep in my collection. Thus traded my copy away.

This game is incredibly tense. You really, really need to pay attention to what other people are doing, and not in that boring "figure out what space Jane wants" Euro kind of way. Every single action in the game is meaningful, and you "feel" the theme of the game (adrenaline and dread) the moment you take your first funding card. Incredibly easy to teach, doesn't overstay it's welcome, and has basically no down time. It's close to perfect IMHO if you like economic type games. Really makes Medici, Modern Art, Ra, etc feel pretty womp-womp after playing this.

I have a weakness for games where it's all about player interaction. The review https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1529439/million-hopes-two-fitty-cash-review-ponzi-scheme made me aware The Ponzi Scheme and the idea of a game where you have nothing but bluffing (in this case about future profits) to get the resources you need is simply an offer too good to refuse. 

The gameplay fulfilled all my expectations. In the fund phase, you have the agonizing decision of which investment horizon to go for. Pass and hope that the current leader go bankrupt soon? Small funding to finance the immediate payments? Or perhaps large funding to improve your portfolio but also the risk of going bankrupt yourself? In the trade phase you have to decide whether to aim for buying or selling and then find a partner and a price that will yield the best possible trade (for yourself).

With simple rules, relatively short gameplay and plenty of room for table talk both during and after the game, Ponzi Scheme is a great hybrid between a party game with laughter and gamer's game with heavy decisions.

Originale e geniale gioco sulla speculazione che riproduce un piano di indebitamento non sostenibile al punto di generare un vortice di indebitamenti che porterà al fallimento e di conseguenza alla fine della partita. Questi aspetti, da valutare con molta attenzione possono generare partite dalla durata molto variabile ma ugualmente avvincenti e cariche di adrenalina. In sintesi trovo Ponzi Scheme un gioco frizzante e inebriante dalla durata contenuta ma ugualmente gratificante. Promosso a pieni voti.

RATING: 5
The theme was attractive, but this was not what I was hoping for. While the "clandestine trading" mechanic is simple and maybe clever, it never felt satisfying - you can only make middling offers where you would be satisfied with either result (buy or sell) ... and if that's the case, who really cares what the result is? Also, players agreed that the game end doesn't feel satisfying; it usually ends unexpectedly and early.

Also, it's one of those games where all choices are "bad" (especially in the funding phase), and you're just trying to choose the least bad one. This is rarely fun for me. Everyone loses - you just want someone to lose slightly before you!

[b]Ponzi Scheme[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6/8):[/COLOR]

[i]Ponzi Scheme was difficult to rate because I was only able to play twice in one night, so this is really just my initial thoughts/rating. From a game play perspective Ponzi Scheme is a solid economic game that [i]can not[/i] be mathed out, which for me is a huge plus. However; since it is an economic game some players will [i]try[/i] and math it out which unfortunately begins to suck the fun out of the game. This isn't Power Grid, it's a game about taking on debt and making sure you're not the first one to go bankrupt, in my opinion the game play supports a more fly by the seat of you pants approach versus grinding the game to halt as you calculate your best move [i](which really isn't possible anyway)[/i]. 

In the end I really enjoyed the game play, especially having to read your opponents and the player interaction. Unfortunately the game can too easily bog down depending on who you're playing with so it's not a game I'd agree to play all the time.[/i]

遊戲節奏難抓
第一目標可能還是不要破產
且分散購買建築物讓之後想拿哪層的卡都可拿
遊戲在一定回合數幾乎都會破產
根據每個人拿的投資卡關鍵回合數不同
嘴砲點在這，可以因為我自己要破產逼迫第二名做大金額交易
所以事實上不能算是精算遊戲，應該是嘴砲遊戲
規則:
*將起始資金卡放在資金面板上，按數字大小最小的放上面，剩下資金卡跟熊卡洗勻放旁邊，四種產業卡跟奢持品放旁邊，紙鈔分類放在紙鎮上
*每人拿一個屏風時間輪，時間輪起始卡放在時間輪箭頭上，起始玩家拿標記並順時鐘開始遊戲
*遊戲每回合每位玩家輪流進行六個步驟直到有人倒閉為止，分數最高的勝利
1.募資 可跳過不做，拿一個產業跟一張資金卡，該產業是第幾個一樣的就要拿第幾列的資金卡，三個以上產業就不能再拿了，資金卡拿走馬上補，並一樣排序，資金卡用完將棄牌堆重洗
*資金卡中樣數字是獲得的錢，下方左邊數字是你放在你對應的時間輪，右邊數字是到時候要付的錢
2.暗盤交易 一樣可跳過(第一回合不進行)，選一位跟你有同樣產業的玩家並指定要交易的產業，在交易信封放前傳給他，對手只能選擇收錢給你產業，或是給你信封上等量的錢，產業賣你
3.傳遞起始玩家標記 給左手邊的玩家，該玩家選擇一張資金卡移除放到棄牌堆(起始資金卡被移除就移出遊戲)，然後再補滿
4.檢查崩盤 資金列中熊卡大於等於玩家人數時就崩盤
>所有熊卡移入棄牌堆，然後棄牌堆洗進資金卡牌庫在補滿資金列
>起始玩家開始輪流棄一個產業，必須棄最多的
5.轉動時間輪 時間輪順時鐘轉一格，崩盤時轉兩格(轉兩格略過資金卡時，將資金卡移動到時間輪箭頭位置)
6.支付利息 支付箭頭處所有資金卡利息，之付完的卡會在跑到時間輪的對應數字
*遊戲結束沒破產的玩家記分，加總下面兩個分數最高的贏

RATING: 5
This is a wonderful match of mechanics and theme, using a process I haven't seen before to create a real sense of impending and imminent doom. You're striving to take enough money in (by taking yet more loans each turn) to pay the crippling interest on the past "loans" you've taken, in the hope that someone else will go bankrupt just before you do, in which case you get to score and be in contention for the win. The problem is that the last few turns generate some wild point swings with the point-tiles changing hands via trades, and hence the game is rife with king-making decisions on whether and when to accept them or not. There's also a high degree of uncertainty on whether any given turn is the last turn (a lot of money changes hands secretly as part of the trades), so it feels like a lottery re the point at which you go hard(er) for points. Make a wrong choice and the game blows by in the wind. These were enough to turn us off the game, despite the thematic appeal.

Based on one play: This really gives a good feel of a Ponzi scheme. You take in money and shares with the promise of paying more later while buying and selling shares between players. Sure enough someone will go bankrupt and when it happens you hope to have the most money. One of those games where the value of shares is what you make of it and you can't really know what others will do so there is a lot of back and forth. It is well designed with simple mechanics but a great feel during play and the mechanics match the theme really well.

In Ponzi Scheme, players take loan after loan and very soon find themselves taking out larger and larger loans with worse terms just so that they can pay the interest on previous loans.  The goal of the game is to outlast your competition--as soon as the first player goes bankrupt, the game ends.  On a player's turn, a player takes a building piece and a loan, which has a payout value, an interest amount, and an interest due period.  The loan is placed on a windrose in the appropriately-numbered slot; this windrose rotates each turn to show what's come due, much like in Macao.  You can also exchange building tiles with other players via a closed, fixed-price auction.  When the game ends, whoever isn't bankrupt and has the biggest buildings wins.  The key to the game is figuring out on which turn the game will end, and make your big interest payments come due after that.  However, your options on loans that you can take may be limited based on how big your buildings are.  Additionally, a player who mismanaged his finances can cause the game to end before other players expect.  Overall, though, I thought this was a very interesting finance management game that employs mechanics and themes I haven't seen before.

Economic, social, trading survival; excellent theme and mechanic blend to illustrate debt and borrowing (theme might not appeal to everyone). A bit math heavy (mental math skills a plus)
Need the right group (larger, economic swindlers), Accurate pricing evaluation (a.la Isle of Skye) needed to play well, heavily favors experienced players. Inexperienced players can (inadvertently) meddle with the game, ending it early, influencing.

This is a neat take on investment games, where the goal is to hang on rather than actually make real progress, and with hard deals offered between players based on leverage and liquidity.

I worry a bit that it is too long for what it is -- the late game has neat inter-player dynamics, but I'm not convince the beginning is different enough between plays.  Hopefully it speeds up rather than slows down with more experience.

update:  I now worry less about length and more about kingmaking.  It's quite easy for a mistake or miscalculation to throw the game beyond the control of other players.  When it happens, it's obscured which may nor may not make it ok depending on the crowd.  I don't know if that will reduce with more skilled players, but I'm not sure it will.  It can also be too easy to end up in a position where you know you can't win well before the end of the game, even if you aren't sure which other player will win.  That can lead to very explicit kingmaking or simple frustration.  But it's still a wild and entertaining time.

The tension just ramps up higher and higher in this game, and you know you need to take a card that will give you a bunch of money now, but man in three turns it's going to be super nasty and could potentially knock you out of the game, and if that happens you definitely lost, even though you wheeled and dealed and managed to build up two of your industries. But then you take that contract with confidence, because you're about 90% sure you will never have to pay that ridiculously high amount since you can look over at two other players and see them sweating bullets over their poor decisions. You consider giving them an insultingly low offer for their tiles because you figure they're desperate, but they have been taking in money and may have just enough to pay you back and once again force you to give up your points.

So yeah. Basically this is a push your luck game with a bit of a mind game going on. It's very enjoyable, and has a wonderfully thematic feel with a unique theme to boot, which is hard to do nowadays.

Economic games are not my favourite, but a friend was excited to try this, so we gave it a shot. It was more enjoyable than I expected, since there were enough social elements to balance out the dry evaluations, but I'm still not excited to play it again. The hidden offer and resolution keeps almost everyone in the dark and makes it even harder to value items than in most auction games, causing distinct unfairness that I was able to exploit in order to win, which is within the spirit of this game, but not something I enjoy in games.

tl;dr: well, now this is different!

How many games have a mechanism that will make sure at least one person goes bankrupt? This is the only one I know. That's actually the end game trigger: one or more players go bankrupt. This is archived by having VERY high interest rates on loans. And you need loans. Some of them are over 100% and there is no way to pay them back. So the only way you can stay in the game is by being able to lend more than you have to pay. And as the game goes on, that becomes harder and harder, because the maximum amount you can borrow can very easily be exceeded by your interest payments if you don't pay attention to how these start accumulating.
I thought this was pretty cool. None of us really had any idea of how to play, so we all just tried some stuff. I'm still not sure if you're better off going for higher amounts sooner or not.
Definitely worth a try!

Ponzi Scheme is one of those games where the "game" is in correctly assessing the financial position of your opponents so you can use the information to buy or sell shares to your advantage. Sort of like having a big stack of chips in a texas hold-em game where you use the leverage to push people around except you can't see the stack of chips. This is very different skill than something like a once around auction game like Medici, where everything is visible is a easier to track and understand. It took me a while to get a feel for the game, and I still don't think I understand how to correctly assess the relative value of shares. I personally loved it, primarily for the hilarious theme and opportunity for some blustery bluffing.  It does an excellent job of communicating the theme of trying to come out on top while leaving the other players holding the bag.

I'm not 100% sure that Ponzi Scheme isn't 100% bullshit. But it's certainly *fun* bullshit. Keep taking on debts, often massively unsustainable debts and hope that your personal apocalypse comes slightly later than someone else's.

And in amongst all that is the actual point of the game; to collect sets of industry tiles with a clever match or accept bidding mechanism.

As I say, it was a lot of fun and ends long before it outstays its welcome.

This one is fun, I need more plays to see how it holds up over time with the interesting mechanics.  In the end, everyone loses, but who can hold off their investors for the longest before it all comes crashing down.  But not really, it's who has the most money to themselves, when it comes crashing down on one of the people at the table.  That's the bummer.  A miscalculation by someone else can ruin your game through no fault of your own, or should I truly be guessing how much other people have and what comes due on their boards so I know when to optimize my cash on hand.

I actually like Ponzi Scheme quite a bit, given my usual aversion to trading games. Other gamers who feel the same way might want to take a look, as it doesn't have the freedom of back-and-forth negotiation that a) works poorly for some personalities, and b) frequently increases game length inordinately. Since each trade interaction is actually just an ultimatum game, it goes quite quickly and with a minimum of fuss.

Worst game of 2016. In addition to be dry, fiddly and mathy, this game puts one player - the one who just happens to be forced to take the first large loan with either a short due date or a large interest rate - in the horrible position of knowing they're going to go bust and lose the game, and that they have absolutely noting they can do about it. Even more, they are then in a position to play kingmaker (and since there's nothing else they can do to further their own game, why not?). Horrible, horrible, horrible.

Had a lot of fun in my plays of this, it's definitely unique in it's game play.  The fact that the game is constructed in such a way that someone or possibly multiple people will absolutely go bust creates a funny, stressful environment of bravado and bluffing where you have to try to survive but also thrive.

Definitely fits the theme and does so in a way that is both funny and entertaining and allows a good amount of strategy and secret deal making.

Ponzi Scheme is a game where (at least) one player will go bankrupt. That's how the game ends. When that happens, whoever is doing best (and didn't go bankrupt) wins.

In the game, there's four types of companies you can have shares in. Scoring is primarily based on having a lot of shares in a company. There's two ways to get shares. We'll talk about the initial way now and skip the other for a bit.

If you have two or fewer shares in a company, you can simply "fund" to take a share of that company during the funding phase. If you do, you have to take a loan from the market. The loans are divided into three areas. If the share you took is your first share in a company, you take one of the loans from the first tier. If it's the second, you take from the second tier, etc.

The loans, have an amount of money that you get immediately, have a repayment amount (generally much higher than what you got), and a repayment period. You have a time tracking wheel where you place the loan. So a loan that needs to be paid back in four turns, goes next to the four spot. Each round, you're going to to turn that wheel. Eventually the arrow showing the current turn will turn until it reaches the loan. At that point you have to repay the loan (or loans) if you can. Assuming everyone can, then the paid loan cards are put around the time wheel again. That's right... you'll be paying interest on that loan every 4 turns. At some point you might start taking loans just to pay off old loans (hence Ponzi Scheme). The loans in the market vary in terms of how much they give you, require to be paid, and how long the payment term is.

The other way to get shares in the game, and the only way to get more than three shares, is to "trade" with another player. Both you and the other player must have at least one share of the same company in common. You put an amount of money into an envelope secretly. They get the envelope and have a choice. Either they take the money and give you the share or they put the same amount of money into the envelope, give it back to you and take your share. Of course, this means that the other players at the table see that money has changed hands, but have no idea how much... or how that impacts the likelihood of bankruptcy.

After a round of funding and trading, the start player rotates, and the start player discards a long from the market. There are some market cards that have bears on them. If there's ever three bear cards in the market at this point, the market crashes. Which means that all the bear cards are removed, the market discards and draw pile are shuffled, and the market is refilled. Additionally every player must discard a share from the company they have the most in and the time wheel rotates twice this round instead of just once as it normally does.

Like a Ponzi scheme, the economics of this game aren't sustainable. Sooner or later someone will go bankrupt. The trick is to gauge when that will be and make your push to have the most points that round. Of course, spending a lot of money to take shares in a round is likely to leave you cash poor for the next round if you timed things incorrectly. And someone offering you a trade can strip you of points or money at just the wrong time. There's some interesting stuff going on in this game that you just don't see in other games.

Provisional rating, one play at Spiel. Players are taking out loans of usually increasing size and decreasing efficiency (e.g. frequent interest payments larger than the borrowed amount), and the game ends when the first person fails to manage their cashflow and goes bankrupt. Buildings are bought and sold between the players, and you need to be very aware of your opponents' situation in order to price these correctly. Requires a mindset different to other business games I've played, but is no more numerically challenging than Power Grid (which does still challenge me).

Some interesting ideas (mechanically) but the theme does not get me the slightest

[+] I liked the time/risk management aspect, and the secret buy/sell orders
[-] components, cover, art and theme are pretty bad. One player can throw the game anytime, and it seems king-making is unavoidable (when you know you are losing at the end of the round, you can pretty much decide the winner by who you are helping/going after)

Definitely unique. I *feel* like there are some real issues - king making, runaway leader, fall away loser... but will need more plays to confirm.

Love the theme and the idea behind this game but ultimately it's not a game I will ever be able to play well because it goes against my nature.

This does an admirable job of making a game about Ponzi schemes more fun and interesting than the spreadsheet of return rates it could have been. Each round players choose a loan with a ridiculous interest rate and use the money to invest in other opportunities. Then each player, in turn, tries to buy into even more investments that are held by the other players. Within this swirling ecosystem, money changes hands very quickly and someone could go from an easy lead to a financial crisis in the blink of an eye.

It's all very tense, the only thing lacking is a mechanism by which you would have to actually con the original investors out of their money. I guess the second part of the game round, where you try to prey upon your cash strapped opponents, is a decent enough stand in for whatever is missing in acquiring your initial funding.

It's probably a little dry for the average mixed interest play group, but if your table likes a good economic numbers game, this is probably worth checking out.

Best game I played at BGG 2016.  Cool buy/sell mechanic with a pressure packed ponzi scheme economic system driving the game to conclusion.

Unique, which is more than I can say for most new games.

Played it once and I don't think the rest of the group enjoyed it either. Other players end up determining the winner Kingmaker style.

Game really makes you feel like you're running a Ponzi scheme and trying to hold it together with ever growing payback pains. The "market maker" mechanic of a secret deal to buy/sell a property is very interesting as well.

RATING: 8.8
[EDIT] oh come on, it always plays the same means it is always a lot of fun. Absurdly good game!

-----------------
After my second play, I raise the rating to 8.8. it's such an original and fun game, full of laughter and tension and soo original! It's not a 9 because probably it almost always plays the same, not many variations between games.
The current price (60€) is absolutely absurd.

-------------------
This is a great great game of economics and trade. Extremely original and new but still simple mechanics, we had to laugh and cry out in roaring laughs while we were plunging ourselves in deeper and deeper debts hoping not to be the first going bankrupt.
Art is probably the only less-quality part but it's not a problem. The leathery thing you use to make your offers is, on the other hand, a wonderful, wonderful touch!
Rating could raise over my initial 8.3!
I'll play it again as soon as I have the chance!

Detestable subject matter based on the shameless exploitation of people not willing to realize when something is too good to be true.

I wanted to not like the game going in but I can't because it works so well by creating such a simple system that replicates leveraging cash to make bigger deals.  Staying ahead of the float as long as the market does not crash.  I love the inside trade that forces transactions--buy me out or sell! The art is in valuation of tomorrow and NOT yesterday's money. Great game. My only niggles are that paper money is a pain (but I understand its thematic need with the folio), and the gardening needed to sort the new market loan tiles.

As many have said, it truly is a dark theme and a unique concept. The tight-wire act of balancing future liability against short-term gain was a lot of fun, and the clandestine trading made for some interesting exchanges and good laughs. I'd say the end of the game breaks down slightly when people see it coming, as players just sort of give up and let it run out, making the last few trades a bit weird. I quite like it, but it really needs the right group.

take a loan to get money to pay off a previous loan and possibly buy from or sell to other players some abstract VP tiles that represent investments... and around and around again like that... it's cute, but dry, and I like my money math calculable, not at the whim of player mood or foggy thinking... but it plays...

Very interesting mechanic, just played two games, need to play a few more games to look for different way to play with. Right now, it feels like the main purpose is not point, but rather just keeping yourself from not being bankrupt.Ended up playing 2 more games with different group, couldn't find new strategy except keeping myself from getting bankrupt.

The ultimate 'push your luck' game and like nothing else I've played. The only way to fend off bankruptcy is a shrewd sale or taking another scheme out - which sends you further down the spiral. You've just got to outlast someone else.
Great, bonkers fun

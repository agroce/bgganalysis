People talk about how they want a replacement or re-implementation of Arkham Horror and the common answer is Eldritch. I think that's incorrect for a series of reasons, but mostly because MoM2e fits much better in terms of why people don't like EH as a replacement (it's a fine game, but it's different). MoM2e requires you to engage monsters, there are more consequences, the tension ratchets up as folks become deranged or damaged since there is no easy/consistent way of healing. The Mythos phase is something everyone fears much more. It's much more confined and almost claustrophobic in feel compared to EH's more worldly romp. In short, it's a Lovecrafting experience more so than EH is in many ways. The app is rather slick, even if you do spend a lot of time "heads down" in the app instead of engaged in the board or with other players.

I think some things really annoy me about the game though, the inability to heal is thematic, but an annoyance. That I get pegged by the Mythos phase *and* have to do a horror check against critters makes sense, but sort of sucks as you spend all of this time beating on stuff just to avoid gaining gobs of horror. I sort of regret basing the minis, but really, this is a game where the minis are super clunky but sweet (and helpful in terms of narrative as they are imposing with bases, and it makes the rooms crowded) to look at on the board... A real storage solution would help, I guess if I was willing to dedicate a suitcase or a ginormous wad of plick-n-pluck and build something... Last, even for an Ameritrash-style game, it's on rails courtesy of the scenario-driven system and as such, once you play through a scenario two, maybe three times, it falls flat (e.g. you know you have X turns until a critter spawns here, and you know what information an NPC is going to give you).

For a thematic experience though, it's hard to beat, but I come away from playing with a sour taste in my mouth for some reason, I don't know. I waffle on a 4 or 5; I want to play it again, but only scenarios I haven't seen (and there is a finite number) and then move on. That twist is because the emotional response is tied to the very thing that it excels at (theme and surprise), it ultimately falters with repeated play...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
From a mechanical perspective, there really isn't much in the way of meaningful decisions to make in the game, and some of the scenarios are loooong. 

But on the other hand, it's one of the most engaging storytelling games I've played, and doesn't *feel* anywhere near as long as Arkham / Eldritch even though it often is. 

The cost of buying not only the game, but enough scenarios to keep it interesting, is also fairly outrageous - and fortunately a burden I don't have to bear.

A mixed bag which overall I seem to enjoy. Will become a staple part of my case for being an Omnigamer...

The monster moves, role dice, role again, roll some more, still mythos phase… Do every obvious choice there is on the board, but not knowing what you do it for, oh and roll dice, evade a monster, roll more dice, but why? Who knows? This game blew me away reading the rules, listen to how The Secret Cabal loved it, Tom Vasel too, everyone(!) why? Might as well buy more dice, sit in the corner with an app, any app with (suiting) music and roll dice. Like Vlada Chvatil wrote in Ignacy Trzewiczek's book Board Games That Tell Stories (great book, read it!) he wrote that video games creates a stronger theme than board games, for me this proves the opposite (though I get his point!). I’m so glad I have Eldritch Horror and can’t wait to play it again after these horrible experiences. Hype can really be a bad thing :(

This is one of our favs. I know many do not care for app-driven games but this one really works. The app takes the burden off the gamers to run the game and allows everyone to take part in the fun. The minitures are a little lack-luster and ill-fitting in their bases but this does not detract from the game in the least.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Play time is definitely longer than what is indicated on each scenario, but what an experience ! The digital application does most of the heavy work - you can almost play without having read the rule, since the application guides you through each phase. Material is of quality, except the small black plates that tend to detach. Good replayability.

RATING: 6
This is a fun coop game that uses an app to act as the gamemaster, revealing the layout of the mansion and the monsters/creatures/characters you encounter. The app is a nice touch in a lot of ways, in that it frees everybody up to be players, but it ends up absorbing or requiring a lot of focus. I find that the players all tend to crowd around the iPad reading the notes that the app issues. Perhaps if the app vocalized all of the notes instead, so the players just listened to it and reacted instead of obsessing over the iPad, it would solve my problem, but as it is now I found the app use to distract from the game.

O jogo é uma experiência deveras gratificante. Imersivo, divertido e tenso em vários momentos. O app te deixa na ponta dos pés o tempo todo e ele serve como um verdadeiro GM, alem da sua narrativas e barulhos/músicas produzidas por ele.

Uma das melhores experiências que tive com Boardgame até hoje

RATING: 9
This game is quickly becoming one of my favorite boardgames, It is incredibly thematic and the integration with the app is extremely well done. I own and enjoyed the original Mansions of Madness, and while I do sometimes miss the ability to play against someone who can make intelligent decisions against you based on the board state, I still feel that what it adds makes it a much better game. Top among them is the fact that that you can no longer see all of the map and instead have to explore it as you go. This small change makes it more thematic, adds surprise to the game, and reduces dramatically the setup time.
The game is simple enough that even people playing it for the first time will quickly understand it, while still letting you make relevant decisions.

1st play:  Every once in a while a game comes along that is hyped up, and when I play it, I have to assume I played a different game than everyone else.  This game forces you to stare at an iPad for 2 hours to essentially play Elder Signs.  There's no interesting decisions really, and the story isn't that great if Cthulu isn't your thing.  I'm not even sure there was a story now that I think about it....

I haven't really liked a single "adventure board game" before this one. They all just seem to fall flat mechanically. But MoM 2e has exceeded my expectations. I hate apps in board games, but dangit! The app works so well. It makes the adventure and mystery so bloody neat. It's just a bunch of fun. 

There are definitely some flaws in the execution. But the game is so unique and interesting regardless, it's hard not to enjoy it.

Okay - this one is huge on BGG right now and moving up the ranks quick. I was super excited about and couldn't wait to get it to the table. Granted I am still in the glow that results after the first play of something I liked but this game fired on all cylinders for me. We hooked up a blue tooth speaker on the table for ambiance and my wife and I adventured away. We actually lost the first scenario as wife's investigator went insane right at the end. Can't wait to play again.

I love this implementation of an app into board game - it saves so much time during setup and everybody can play co-operatively together. It lets me immerse into the story and the gameplay is quite fast and smooth. After finishing one scenario you want to play again and again. We're really hooked! I hope they'll release more scenarios.

RATING: 5.5
The jury is still out.  I can see this being great, or getting old quickly.

Multiplayer is too long for my taste, and really actually very boring.  There is nothing to think about during gameplay. Solo is even more boring for the same reason--at least Eldritch Horror gives you a lot to keep track of to keep your mind occupied.

There really is very little replayability.   Honestly the plot is the only thing keeping you engaged, and once that is stale and predictable, this game has nothing going for it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Mansions of Madness 2nd Edition is a narrative-based dungeon crawler that has marked ups and downs. It should be compared to pandemic legacy for its narrative and to arkham horror lcg for its theme. Yet it has an app that the others don't have and others shouldn't have. The inclusion of an app adds more than it detracts from, and it works well for this kind of game.

Games that appeal to certain similar mechanics or themes and will be compared to during the review: Gloomhaven, Arkham Horror LCG, Pandemic Legacy.

Pros:
+Very easy to teach, on par with party games. Only the game owner needs to know the rules and have played at least once or twice. Then, they can teach as mechanics arise. I have always begun playing within 5 minutes of opening the game box, as all they need to know is they have 2 actions than can be used to move or interact to start playing. The difficulty of the first game depends on the player, and I've had successful games with new players starting at difficulties 2, 4 and 5 out of 5. So far all new players have lost (as a group) but they enjoyed the game. One new player even turned insane and won.
+Appealing narrative, it is like playing an interactive story, or reading a book, as long as you approach it with that in mind.
+The app sets up the mood with music, cutscenes and voice acting on the cutscenes. Don't listen to purists and actually try this game before bashing on it just for needing an app. The game is greatly enhanced by having an app rather than not.
+It plays very differently at all player counts, and each provide a different and good experience. Solo play is like reading a book, and is fully cooperative. With two players, you may keep only the 1+ insanities to keep it fully cooperative, or 2+ to include some annoying stuff. With 3 to 5 players, you have almost always someone or someones turn insane, and now you won't fully trust them. Even though the game is easier with more, as they turn insane, they start burning, pushing, stealing from each other, wanting to trade dynamites, not wanting to trade dynamites, and it is a different experience, and still fun. It might be best to remove the 1+ cards from 4 player games, and the 2+ too for 5 player games. This would balance the fact that people find it easier with more people.

Cons:
-Little bang for the buck (although once reaches a critical mass of $200 worth of product, it keeps adding more replayability with each extra expansion).
-Like all FFG's games, you need expansions to make the game worth it. The base game has four scenarios with low replayability. Expansions not only add scenarios, but make every scenario more replayable by adding more cards, investigators, monsters and tiles.
-Fiddly game, where you will spend a lot of the actual game play not playing, but either reading or placing tokens or finding cards or tiles.
-You don't mind investigator balance. Skill points sum to 21, but strength and will are the most useful ones on most characters in the party, except the caster, which needs lore instead of strength. Observation, Agility, and specially Influence, are weaker relative to the others. Ability power level between investigators has a lot of variance. Even if agility is the most common combat check, it won't be used as often because starting with a heavy weapon is more common than starting with a bladed one.
-From three to five players you will have a lot of downtime between player turns. If anyone doesn't like to read or follow the narrative, they will quickly become bored.
-The monster and base fit is bad, and some will hold tight but others will fall down all the time. There are residues in both the miniature peg that goes to the base and inside the base itself so that the cardboard inserts will get small damage indents.
-Spells. I don't get why they don't get the attack treatment and just resolve inside the app. It is annoying to randomly assign one card from a 5 card deck, including one you just saw.
-Most skill checks. I don't know why they didn't just hide the pass and fail effects, like the checks when interacting with search tokens and people. It is unthematic to know what will happen if you pass or fail, so there is no suspense or risk in spending clues.
-Player count balance: Two players have just too little actions to complete the most difficult missions. Three is the minimum to complete 4 and 5 star difficulties with a significant chance of success. The betrayer mechanic also doesn't scale too well. Betrayers appear on 4 cards that are used on 3+ players. However, becoming a betrayer on a three player game is too hard to overcome, while on a five player game it would be too weak.

Mixed:
~The miniatures. The plastic can hold a lot of detail, yet only the deep one hybrid has enough detail to make the most of the plastic. I would recommend the developers to include more detail in the future miniatures. The bad thing is that the
size tolerances aren't good and the (I assume manual assembly) for big pieces like the star spawn makes some stuff not regular. In my game, one star spawn can fit in
a tight box, and another can't because the wings and legs are glued with a different rotation.
~Buy in cost is actually $200: The core game itself, even though it comes with a lot of components, won't be able to offer too many playthroughs. The core only (with no expansions) scenarios will spawn the same monsters in the same places, you will get the same starting items often, you will get few to no map layout variations and the difficulty distribution is awkward (2 stars, 3 stars but takes 4-6 hours, 4 stars, and five stars). This means that after a few tries you will want something more than the two star scenario, but find that you have no options for smooth progression. There is one 3 star scenario with acceptable playtime in one expansion, and another expansion has a two and a four star scenario. Unfortunately, the DLC that only requires the base game is also four star difficulty. The upside is that once you get enough expansions, you will have enough monster, item, investigator and scenario variability to make it replayable enough that it is worth $200. With the core costing about $80 when it is available, it doesn't offer $80 worth of replayability, but something closer to $50. At $200 you get about $200 replayability. Note that as more expansions come, the replayability value will surpass its cost, making each expansion even more worthwhile. The advantage is that expansion monsters and cards are almost always used in every scenario. Also, new expansions not only offer new tiles for the new maps, but some are also included as new layouts for previous scenarios, increasing the replayability of existing ones.

You should get if:
+You like reading books or playing interactive stories.
+You like the Cthulhu mythos
+You can afford spending about $200 for reaching enough replayability.

You should instead get other games if:
-You need a lot of replayability. Get arkham horror lcg. It has more replayability per dollar.
-You are on a budget (the base game, at $80, is not worth it. You must include expansion costs inside the initial purchase for the game to have a minimum of replayability, so add 3 expansions for $120). The buy in cost for the game technically becomes $200 this way. Get pandemic legacy, since it is $50 for the full experience.
-You don't like the Cthulhu theme. Get Gloomhaven instead.

What you should ignore:
~Any concerns for the app. It has integrated five attack decks and every monster attack and horror deck, and random starting items and random items that drop in the game or monsters that appear (from a specific pool), so it adds quite some variability in gameplay just there. It also adds music and voiceovers for a more thematic experience. You also get rid of the need for a keeper and the game owner (typically the keeper) doesn't have to spoil themselves the story before playing. It provides just too much to this game to pass it just for having an app.

Expansion recommendations:
If you decided to invest in Mansions, what should you get with $200?
1) Core box for $85 (get it while in print, not when out of print and far more expensive)
2) Recurring Nightmares for $45
3) Streets of Arkham for $45
4) Beyond the Treshold for $25

If you liked those and still want more, or if you want specific investigators, then get Suppressed Memories.

Up to the products released for 2017, the least important expansion is Suppressed Memories. Recurring Nightmares adds everything Suppressed does, but additionally you get 2 new map layouts for the core's Cycle of Eternity and Shattered Bonds. Every mansion-like map that uses core tiles is also suited for the mansion-like tiles from Recurring Nightmares. The only good thing Suppressed Memories adds is more monsters and more investigators and a 3 star difficulty scenario to bridge the gap from cycle of eternity to the next viable scenario.

Why I ranked expansions like i did?
For me, replayability in this game depends on the following factors:
-Investigator pool, with an exponentially increasing team composition options based on quantity. (most from figures and tiles collections)
-Scenario Quantity (most from small box and big box)
-Scenario Map Layout variety per scenario (most from figures and tiles collections)
-Available starting items (most from small and big box)
-Monsters spawning in game (most from figures and tiles collections)
-Items you can get in game (most from small and big box)
-Damage and Horror cards (only from small and big box)
-Conditions and insanity cards (only from small and big box)
-Puzzle variety (only from big box)
-Any new additional mechanic (only from big box)

Most people will tend to rank just scenario quantity, but as you can see, there is more to it than just that.

Final Thoughts:
The game has a lot of theme, enhanced by the app's music and voiceovers. It is ridiculously easy to teach, but is fiddly, expensive and not enough investigator and player count balance. If you have less than $200 lying around, get pandemic legacy or gloomhaven, both popular and highly ranked games. If you have $200 or more, and can set aside around $100 per year for the next 5 years, consider mansions or arkham horror lcg. Prioritizing bang for the buck, replayability and mechanics means you lean to arkham horror lcg. If you prioritize ease of teaching and immersive theme, go for mansions.

Notes: I have around 15 play sessions as of the last edit of this review, with player counts 1 to 4.

Solo score: 9/10. Player scaling will limit you to the easier scenarios if you want to play with only 2 investigators.
Duo score: 8.5/10: It is the same as playing by yourself. The game is still agile enough to maintain attention to all the narrative.
3 player score: 8/10: Hard to maintain focus through every piece of narrative, and players will scatter to focus on goals. The betrayer mechanic hits hard here, as you suddenly went to a 3 vs game to a 2vs 1+game.
4 player score: 8.5/10: It is possible for supports to play their role, as it is very likely one pair will investigate while two others do their own thing. Even though you won't pay attention to every bit of narrative, the betrayers don't hit as hard.
5 players: Haven't played at this count, but I imagine the downtime between player actions would be a bit too much, and the betrayer mechanic would be too diluted to matter too much.

Ideal player counts: 1, 2 and 4. Houserulings, even if it is just including or excluding some insanity cards, may make 3 players a better experience. Five players, opposite from three, would require stronger betrayers or chance to become one. I would suggest trating 3+ cards as 4+ ones, and creating new 3+ insanity cards. Also create 5+ if you somehow manage to find five people willing to have that much downtime, with stronger betrayer mechanics.

Otro juego que va directo a mi lista de favoritos!

Sobre la famosa rejugabilidad:

La primera vez que juegas una misión (la que sea) es una experiencia increíble. La sensación de no saber que hay al otro lado de una puerta, de si te conviene o no abrirla en estos momentos, de si debieras investigar la misteriosa pila de papeles antiguos que hay sobre el escritorio antes de abandonar la habitación perdiendo un tiempo valioso con ello... para los que nos gusta este tipo de juegos de aventuras es alucinante.

La segunda vez (y siguientes) que te juegas la misma misión el escenario no es exactamente el mismo y los eventos que se suceden cambian lo suficiente como para que no puedas aprenderte ninguna misión de memoria. Incluso conociendo la trama y los objetivos, sigue siendo un desafío que no tienes por que ganar. Se convierte en un juego más parecido a lo que estamos acostumbrados a ver y jugar en este género. Conoces tus objetivos y como debes conseguirlos, y lo que no sabes es como se desarrollará la partida a causa de eventos, combates y equipo encontrado.

Para mi es un juegazo en ambos casos.

The game is very well built. The scenarios, all the figures. Wow. It is a dream for every geek! But for how much the computer brings in atmosphere it also removes the game charm, when everyone has to turn the heads to read a bit of text and lose the focus from the board. Yes. The puzzles become nicer to play so, yes, it is easier to keep track of a complex game. 
The game mechanics are the typical "Chtulhu's ones" since they reminded me of Arkham's horror, but between the two, I would be a traditionalist and prefer playing Arkham.

Creates a lot of wonderful narrative games.  The app is easy to use, and handles all the hard work.  The components are wonderful.  Gameplay is easy to explain, and easy to play.  I still haven't played all the scenarios, so there's plenty of story left to explore, also!

A perfect blend of board game and video game. It gives the feeling of exploration that video games do far better than board games. The scenarios are hard and long but they are very well put together.

I really like this game. The app is really good though I have only completed 1 scenario. My only complaint is that the monster figurines are shocking! They are cheap plastic and break easily. Def not OK for the price point, but if you can get past this then it is definitely an enjoyable game for those especially who are Arkham Horror or Eldritch Horror fans.

Cool looking minis, love the integration of the iPad. My problem is that the minis don't stay on their bases. I ended up gluing them to the bases because every time I wanted to play I would have to completely reassemble the entire game. Very fun though, and my 10 year old nephew enjoys it too.

I'm not sure if I enjoy this more than the pure board game journeys into the Lovecraft Mythos (Eldritch Horror, Arkham Horror, Elder Sign), but it certainly works as advertised with one of the smoothest app-driven systems released to date, and a very immersive, thematic style of play that will reward the patient who wish to dive in. Is it a little distracting to constantly refer to a screen in the middle of play? Sure, and this could very well have been a pure app or PC game, but the transition to co-op from the original Mansions of Madness seems to work well and I don't regret the asking price whatsoever.

I really enjoy this big box of Cthulu.  It is really the game that I always wanted Arkham Horror to be.  Some scenarios are combat-heavy, some are more in the mold of something like Clue.  

Comparing this to something like Time Stories, TS has a much stronger narrative, but of course it lacks replay-ability.  The narratives aren't quite so well constructed here but this leaves room for variation within the same mission.  

Some people will baulk at the required App stuff but it doesn't irk me at all.  It still feels like a board game first and foremost.  

The only downside to me is the bases that come with the game.  One of the biggest mysteries in the game is how Fantasy Flight thought this was a good idea.  You have these big bulky plastic platforms that obscure the tile art more than needed and the figures dont really fit well when you try and attach them.  I ended up re-basing all my miniatures.

Excellent game with sensible integration of app to act as game master. At the price point I hope they will extend the scenarios in future updates to the app so that this title will remain fresh to owners. I think this is the only concern that stops this game from currently rating a 10 for me.

RATING: 8
Very enjoyable game. The app is very well done, although, personally, I don't really like playing games like this with apps. I feel they kind of distract from the physical game itself and the game looses a bit of that tactile feel that separates boardgames from video games. I'd prefer if it could be played without the app via cards (for example like the co-op expansions to Descent 2nd ed. Dark Elements, etc.)

But the app does have its advantages that'd be hard to do via cards, so people who don't mind apps will find a lot to like here.

RATING: 7.9
Very cool update for this second edition of the game.It takes away all need of FAQ's/miscomprehensions/possibilities for overlord errors during scenario (all of which was quite significant).The app handling every aspect of the bad-guy is such a vast improvement. Also the map as well as portions of the scenario details (ok, it does not make it a different scenario,so..there) is dynamically changing between runthroughs, making the replayability vastly better (especially since in the first edition, a bad guy in one runthrough couldn't play as a player in a future runthrough of the same scenario..too many spoilers). Anyway, I am transforming my first edition material to second edition compatibles as we speak..no need to turn back anymore.

Most frustrating game I own. And potentially the most boring with little replay value.

This game is expensive, the minis are OK but not much more. Instead of those large minis, I would have preferred smaller plastic tokens. You can easily end up with 3 Monsters attacking you in which case you just start to run out of board space. The game itself is very thematic but feels like a game on rails. Once you played the Campaign twice, you know exactly what and when things will happening. 

Tip: Run through and try to open doors as fast as you can. You don't need to investigate every token. Make sure you understand how you block a room.

I guess I was expecting too much from the storytelling aspect of the game, but for me this simply doesn't cut it. The stories felt underwhelming and basic, nothing that I'd still remember in a few months time.

The characterizations are paper thin: Bad guys are bad just because they need to be bad. Add in randomized events that keep kicking you for no reason, insanity effects that can end a multi-hour session in a total disappointment and you're in for a bad time. Some of the scenarios somehow manage to feel rushed while still being extremely long.

The puzzles are very simple and rudimentary as well. For the most part, the game is just collecting clues and battling monsters, which is not very satisfying. People searching for good Cthulhu stories should steer clear.

RATING: 7.5
The second edition of Mansions of Madness introduces quite a few innovations, but the main difference is obviously the app-driven game: this has both positives (almost no set up time, completely cancels the chance of ruining a multiple-hour game due to mis-set up, greater feeling of exploration with the map generated during gameplay) and negatives (much more predictability in enemies' behavior, more generic events for the sake of adaptation to different situations).

The play experience is undoubtedly smooth and enjoyable, and quite atmospheric, even if the length of the scenarios tends to be on the longer side, and probably some are not so replayable.

In a short sentence: better than first edition, good game, even if it is not the definitive game in its genre.

Initial Impression: This time FFG added an app to their list of high quality, thematic components. Counter-intuitively, the app actually adds to the thematic immersion of the game, with its dark visuals and soundtrack playing in the background. The gameplay is fairly straightforward, as each player is allowed 2 actions on their turn, which includes movement, exploration, and interaction with people and objects. The cooperative aspect of the game is highlighted as the players strive to survive the threats and obstacles of the Chapter, while accomplishing the mission objectives. Unfortunately, there's no mechanism included which prevent alpha-gaming. The one thing that puzzles me with this game is that it could very well have been a full fledged tablet game rather than a boardgame, as the app takes care of almost everything. Still, the game system has lots of potential and is ripe for expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I both enjoy this game and find aspects of it disappointing (largely component related). Despite my conflicted opinion of this game, I did purchase some of the expansions for it. In view of that and my willingness to continue playing it despite its flaws, Mansions does appear to have some magic in it. 

I wouldn't have bought this game if I hadn't found it on sale for a good discount from MSRP. It's more a $60 game than a $100 game. 

A lot of the monsters do not fit into the provided bases. The problem is so pervasive that I may just use the counters instead of the miniatures.

***EDIT 2/26/17: So I've played it enough to overcome my resistance to crafts/hobby work, I am going to re-base these miniatures. The included black bases are just awful.

***Edit 3/7/17: New bases are much better. My wife really enjoys this game, so its rating keeps creeping up. I am enjoying the game more with every play through. Now we'll see what happens once we finish playing each scenario 3 times or so.

Promos/Extras/Expansions:
Mansions of Madness: Second Edition – Beyond the Threshold (2017)
Mansions of Madness: Second Edition – Recurring Nightmares Figure and Tile Collection (2016)
Mansions of Madness: Second Edition – Suppressed Memories – Figure and Tile Collection (2016)
Mansions of Madness: Second Edition – Streets of Arkham (2017) -- Looks like FFG has improved the miniatures for this expansion.

Very thematic. But mechanically the game is rather dull. You make story-driven choices in this game. On a mechanic side your choices are more than obvious and flat. 

First I was impressed by the narration of this game. But all in all it is a blender. 

Dull and repetitive actions, little influence and zero replayability in combination with a long playtime with thematic repetition  (same texts over and over again) make this game mediocre. 

Check out Secrets of the lost tomb. A much Better game.

While the game as a whole product is about a 5 for me (games that leave me cold), rating it specifically as a [-]board game[/-] cardboard-collection drops it to 1 (without the app it's not playable at all => not a game).

- - - - - - - - - -

This is my first board game with app integration, and I can only hope that this trend dies pretty fast or at least they learn how to get it right.
The ratio of board game to app is way off for my taste – I was not playing an app-enhanced board game, but a cardboard-enhanced iPad-app, which someone shelled out $100 for printed cardboard.
But they don't really make use of the advantages of the app. The variations in scenario 1 are quite straightforward and not numerous (*1) - it can't hold a candle even compared to a simple build-your-own-adventure-book(let).

So all I'm left with is another thematic board game in H.P. Lovecraft's universe with dice-based combat and uninspired generic stories (like almost all other Cthulhu-related stories in games).
Clearly a game I'm not in the target group.

[b]Edit:[/b]
I've been told that the second scenario provides a much more interesting story/experience.
But honestly I will only play the game again if the owner specifically requests it, otherwise I have zero desire to try it again.


[b]*1[/b] — I have played a friend's copy (he would most likely rate it 8 or even 9) and listened carefully when he told me about the variations he encountered (he played the first scenario 4 or 5 times with different people).
He encountered 2 different buildings, some other decisions in the small arc with the butler, and had a different spawn as the sidekick-threat.

I'm a big fan of this game with smaller groups. Yes, it can be swingy based on some die rolls, but I appreciate how far they took the game from 1st ed. Has the same "play a few times to figure out what you need to do" that TIME Stories has. Killed TS dead for me.

What Lies Within:

Dark Reflections:
2p - Won(1-20-18) Both Wounded, Both Insane!

Rising Tide:
2p - Lost - Both insane, dead investigator.
(Likely won't repeat this one, didn't love it)

Dearly Departed:
2p - Alternate Ending - Both insane, but only one victory condition met.

RATING: 9.8
The story telling in this game is sooooo rich that any session stays on your mental hard disk much longer longer than your average board game, which is a great sign of a good story teller really.

One last remark: since the program is available on 4 different platforms, there is absolutely no risk of software support in 5 or 10 years time. I still have my 1980's boardgames from Avalon Hill with assisted computer software and Windows is running these things on emulators better than it ever was.

Heavy stuff in time played. Even the simplest scenario took me 3+ hours. But with more play the game surpassed almost everything I played in my life. Totally Impressed. 
One hint: after playing the Escape from Innsmouth scenario, read the novel of HP Lovecraft. This game is breathtaking as a story teller...
UPDATE: Escape from Innsmouth is not alone as being so close to the original Lovecraft novels. Other scenarios (except for the first one) are really extensions to existent stories.
A W E S O M E and far surpassing traditional boardgames.

I'm a huge fan of the Cthulhu mythos and this game is an INCREDIBLE immersion into that world. The stories are well written, the components are all nice, and combat is fun though not without flaws.

The scenarios themselves eventually present a bit of a problem. Despite having alternate layouts, scenarios lose replayability quickly due to limited options, interactions, and outcomes. As long as they keep delivering expansions though I'll probably keep playing, and playing often.

RATING: 9.5
If you have played the first mansions of madness and experienced the frustrations of one person running the game and the baddies, erase that from your memory as much as possible, because the app driven second edition essentially erases these woes and allows for a unique, and engaging story of a game that is fairly accessible and even faster to setup than the first edition. The app also allows each and every game to be truly unique as the same scenario will still involve different rooms in different places, different puzzles, different monsters, and possibly a different ending. I'm not sure I will go for the super long missions (the longest of which is listed at 4-6 hours), but most missions I can see enjoying in almost an interactive story kind of a way. 

The app itself runs the game and bad guys, and it does so in a way that is very straight forward and intuitive, but still doesn't blur the line between board game and video game. By all means this is a board game still. Also the app does a good job of keeping track of things like monsters health and attempts at the various puzzles, and also allows for monsters movement and attacks to occur differently each round, making the game feel more thematic and preventing some of the analysis into the "perfect move" that can dry games like this out a bit. 

Excellent cooperative game, and I look forward to playing it again.

As close to an RPG experience you can get with a board game.  The app makes it easy to set up and the mechanics are streamlined.  Limited scenarios do affect replayablility, particularly since you cannot craft your own story lines because of app integration.  It's a fair trade off though because I really don't have time to build scenarios from the ground up anyway.  If I did, I'd still be playing RPGs....

Game relies more on narrative than strategy to satisfy players, and on this front does an admirable job. Relatively random events and die rolls could stop you in your tracks pretty quickly so don't get too frustrated if that happens to you. Expensive for limited scenarios, but I can see us playing through them at least a few times as layouts, items,  and such change with multiple plays. Replaces "Betrayal" for us, just not sure it was worth the expense. We are not Lovecraft nerds either.

I find Arkham games to be riotous with laughter; I've played this game as an elderly woman with brass knuckles. Another time, I failed a shriveling spell and the back of the card read, "That worked exactly like you expected, aside from all of the blood." This game is great but thrives with more people. 

Exploration boards provide a lot of decisions but most of them are linear to the overall story. Sometimes it feels like I am playing a game and other times it feels like a game is playing me.

RATING: 3
This game has a lot of potential but I'd recommend not buying into the hype and waiting at least until there are more scenarios for it. The "60-90min" intro scenario takes 3 hours with a full party and the other scenarios are all said to be longer. Unfortunately a lot of that 3 hours is down time. Unlike Descent's Road to Legend where there's a single peril effect, in this each player has to make a separate horror check which makes the sort of pointless random part of the game take A LOT longer.

P.S. The mini's are not good quality.
P.P.S. I hate you Agent Carver.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Liked first edition apart from the setup (too easy to goof up) and that it really needed at least 4 players. All fixed with this version :) great even solo. Plus you can reuse most of the first edition stuff.

Not perfect though. Insane cards are a bit too random, figures could be better, bases are just stupidly big (storage is a headache), needs more scenarios.

Nice change of pace from Eldritch Horror.

*** Update, more scenarios now (love the downloaded one), and most are good. Most scenarios are surprisingly re-playable, more than I was expecting. Now a firm favourite, hasn't quite overtaken Eldritch Horror, but it's close. Even inspired me to dig out my old citadel paints and have a bash at painting the miniatures :)

Only tried once. It really failed in our group. Game took way to long due to unclear rules. Playing 5 people really took from the experience... 
Why the app doesn't read out aloud everything is a puzzle... it unfortunately makes everyone hug the ipad (or whatever device) as they need to read everything.

With the app connected to a Bluetooth speaker, the atmosphere, sound effects were excellent. The miniatures could be a little better, however I don't actually mind them. I will need to glue them to the bases, and then all will be good. I really enjoy the use of the app in gradually revealing the mansion rooms as well as keeping track of the puzzles. I thoroughly enjoy this game!

Good game, the app needs some work, clearly. Also, the miniatures seem a bit fragile, one came damaged. 

As far as the game, it was simple to start. Kept referencing the rules to make sure I was doing things right. I enjoyed the game solo. I can imagine how much better it would be with other players.

Edit* After updated app and more time, I am really loving this game. While fun solo, it is awesome with 3 players.

RATING: 10
Thankfully this doesn't feel like a digital board game or a video game.  This is most definitely a board game- it feels completely like a board game, it's just streamlined by the app.  A big step up from the original edition just because it's simpler and cleaner and you don't need a DM/keeper.  And it doesn't sacrifice any fun and atmosphere.  Really unique amongst board games, for those reasons and for the great story which is a rarity in board games.  Although this isn't the first game to use an app, it's exciting because it really is a new way to play there's a lot of potential other app assisted games.

Nice game and something I gladly play if I have the time for it. Setup is a beast though and trying to get the miniatures to fit/stick to the black plastic pieces is a nightmare. Nice to have an app for variety but I´m not fond of the game depending on it.

I would have considered buying the app for pure online gaming though if that would have been an option.

Mansions of Madness 2e leaves me with a sense that something is missing. Kind of like I am supposed to wowed by the theme and ignore everything else. The game is neat, but punishing, and the events feel arbitrary. It is mostly an exploration game, but doesn't give you enough time to explore. Replayability is limited, as repeating a scenario is uninteresting.
The much-touted App was a disappointment. It doesn't do anything remarkable. I guess if you liked MoM 1e, you might like this better.

RATING: 5
Random elements make this game feel more like a ride than something you can influence and control. The app has sound effects and voice talent BUT it is concentrated in the first few turns of the first scenario and is more or less missing from the rest of the scenarios! 

I feel that the app should have more sound effects for monsters and much more varied music, perhaps even procedurally generated sequences to heighten tension.

The price of this game is extremely high and it isn't great value in my opinion. If I didn't already have first edition and the expansions I would've given this a miss entirely on the basis of prohibitive cost.

Having said all that I have had a blast with this game, it is simple enough to entice non gamers and has just enough meat on the bones for veterans too. The pricing structure for future scenarios will dictate whether this stays in my collection or not. 

*Now that the first full expansion and proper DLC has been released it is clear that FFG are going to ask a lot of money for not much in return. I thought Imperial Assault was expensive but at least that has replay value...

Lowered to a 5 rating.

Excellent cooperative game, perhaps my favorite of its ilk and even people in my gaming groups that don't like cooperative games liked it. The App is wonderful and improves the experience.

3rd October 2017: So apparently I've played the game with a HUGE disadvantage all this time. (since May 2017) Each group of fire only spreads to one (and only one!)  adjacent space per turn. Meanwhile, I interpreterad the rules as fire spreading to each adjacent space, which often resulted in fire spreading 2-3 spaces EACH TURN. I can't tell you how obnoxious it felt to play. Fire was basically a doomsday device and it was so god awfully boring because I knew I had absolutely no choice but to TRY and extinguish the fire, OR WE WOULD LOSE! It has on its own ruined a handfull of scenarios for me, but I'm at least somewhat glad I can make some sense of it now...

Amazing. As someone who is still mostly opposed to apps in games, this totally works. The app is awesome: the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, graphics are well done, and the music is of a very high quality and really generates an eerie atmosphere (I highly recommend hooking the app up to a large TV so everyone can see/hear what's going on). 

For me, no other game so successfully recreates the feel of Lovecraft's stories as this: from the mystery of his occult mythology to the general uncanny feelings of  helplessness and despair you get from the books, this game has it all. The price is high, and replayability is limited, but to me, it's worth every penny. My favorite Lovecraft game and the best game of 2016.

I'm not a big fan of "ameritrash" nor I am a fan of the Cthulhu theme yet I quite enjoyed the game. We tried the introduction scenario and were able to beat it fairly easily.

RATING: 7.7
This game. Not sure what's up with it because I simultaneously want to criticize it and extol its virtues from a mountain top. First of all, I feel like 70% of my play is interacting with the app. This is heightened in solo play because I can't pass the app off to another player. This means my memories of the game revolve around the iPad and that bothers me just a bit.

However, the game makes great use of the app to streamline play and pull surprises. The benefit of an electronic element such as this is that the game can pull the rug out from under you and surprise you in ways a player restricted by structure can't. I LOVE that and want to be hit with more of those moments.

Much of this game is going to come down to scenario design and I'm excited for the future. Right now, the game has enormous potential but it doesn't fully live up to it. It's enjoyable and a solid game, but I'm not sure it's worth the price tag for what you get in the base game.

With the app doing all of the administrative work, I think this game could point the way toward interesting integration of board games with technology. The app is a marvel - great visuals, very clear iconography, atmospheric music. Being able to randomize and add scenarios should create longevity for the game. Run around, fight, and fetch stuff doesn't exactly make for awesome gameplay or anything, but it is fun.

If I play, I want to read all the fluff out loud, and it is less fun if you don't. This is really a RPG in a box, and if you don't do that this can get very dull because it is so mechanically simple. Also, it has too much downtime with five people.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Don't buy this game for the figures - Cthulhu Wars beats it hands down there. The game requires an app but any notification from other apps knocks out the sound on both IOS and Android devices. 

We played the short introductory scenario - there are only 4 - and it took us 3 hours after an hour of set up rather than the indicated hour and a half. Rules lack clarity, and often I moved twice then waited a good while for my next turn while the app handled the monsters and demanded tests. It's heavy on app time rather than player choices. 

It feels more like a dungeon bash than Call of Cthulhu and by the end was an absurd parody of Lovecraft as the last character was chased out by two Hunting Horrors, two cultists and a Deep One.

The storyline was pretty good but basic Mythos fare. The components are average apart from the miniatures which are ok but have ugly bases and are a pain to assemble with counters you slot in that serve little purpose. Those ugly black bases are also bafflingly too big to fit well in the room spaces.

Overall a pretty mediocre game that might appeal to people who like Arkham Horror (I don't much), long games or spending  £80+ on a game that Hugh and Bec were desperate to end and I enjoyed but not as much as some others.

My advice is just play Call of Cthulhu the rpg or buy Betrayal at House on the Hill - similar theme but better game.

RATING: 8
A very thematic and VERY challenging game. A ton of fun but be prepared to go mad or be killed and NOT save the day often. The app does a good job of randomizing the scenarios and the new scenarios from the extra tile sets and DLC are not easy either. 2 players with a single investigator apiece will have a hard go but 2 investigators apiece at least gives you a fighting chance. A great foray into the Chthulhu mythos for those who enjoy this type of thing. Highly recommend.

Getting my first game (played solo) started was a little harder than it needed to be (Horror Check on app was confusing), and the miniatures are unnecessary IMO, but I had a shitload of fun... looking forward to more. This is a game I know will be fun with the right people.
*Impressed that my 2nd try at the first scenario was very different.
**Didn't like the DLC or Rising Tide that much for solo play as the long investigations are not my favorite part of the game. Also the resulting combat seems simply a long, drawn-out way of telling me I failed the investigation part... now prepare to die.

While it may lack the finesse of a human dungeon master, I'll take the short set-up time and co-operative fun over the 1st edition any day.

While it may have issues during certain missions depending on how you approach them (being too fast & accurate/being too slow and unlucky) most of the time this works very very well.

And yeah, the model bases suck, and the models can be a bit poor, but after spending a few hours rebasing them all I am happy with how they can now stand up without hiding the artwork on the map tiles!

This is easily my favorite game on the shelf.  It has truly improved on the first edition and my gaming group and my family have all craved more.  I have played the first scenario multiple times and the second scenario once.  The mini's are good quality and really add to the board when painted.  The game can be played with just a monster token if you would like.  The app, while I was suspect at first, has really opened up the game and creates a truly cooperative experience.  I am excited to see expansions, both in DLC and boxed.

RATING: 7
Though this is not the prototypical game that I am in the market for my gf and I have been getting into the Arkham mythos and this is a well-themed variation that has much of the flavour and story I like in a self-contained "haunted house" type game. In many ways, the style of this reminds me of Betrayal at House on the Hill, but while the AH prototype is ultra-light, MoM is a medium light, still fairly fluffy in terms of options, but with more gamey decisions, stats, and the like to deal with.

The game itself is interacted with through both a tile-based map and mini system and the integral app that plays the role that used to be manned by an actual person in the first edition. Most turns involve exploring locations (through the app), attacking monsters (through the app) or the like.  You cannot play without the game components though, as the app only tracks what things there are to explore, what monsters are lurking around, and what is going on in the story. The physical components are used to show where the players are, what items they have, where the monsters specifically are, &c.

If you couldn't tell, the game is heavily dominated by the app interface though. Though I wouldn't like this to become the norm (and highly doubt that it ever will) for this particular game I think it works very well and after having played this second edition I have almost zero desire to ever play the first because I can see how having a CPU handle things like variable combat results based on the weapon type used (a card deck based thing in the 1st ed) are cool, but how incredibly fiddly and time consuming they would be with a card-based system.

As with most FFG stuff, you really need to be into the theme and atmosphere over the gameplay itself to get full value here. There aren't a terribly large number of tough decisions (but more than there are in Betrayal), but there is some great theme and I love the way that every interaction: attacking or evading monsters, taking horror checks, &c. are all thematic and narrated through the app. 

This isn't a game that I think I would want to play into the ground though, because I'm sure knowing the stories too well would make it less enjoyable, and also easier in some ways. I have replayed one of the scenarios, and though a few things changed in terms of the monsters and tiles (as I own the expansion stuff now and the app can use those) I still knew too much about what was going to happen and had to hold my tongue for the part of the group that hadn't played it. For the time being I'm enjoying it as a couples game and I'm sure it will get some regular playtime, but without additional purchases the relative lack of available scenarios is an impediment, especially if you group wants / needs specific things in terms of difficulty or expected game length. This can, of course, be rectified to a large degree by opening your wallet, but presently the majority of the physical expansions are light on scenarios and heavy on bits (the 2 tile sets being the worst in this, as they contain a whole bunch of tiles and monsters but only have 1 unique scenario and retail for $50 each), so if you play it for the story (which I do) then you will end up spending a fair bit of money to have more options.

Aside: great minis (honestly: all of the nonsense about how the minis don't look decent is just daft to me; but I don't normally play these types of games and don't expect the world, I have plenty of minis background from my GW days...), but I'm not crazy about how tough the tiles are to slot into the small bases and how some of the minis are prone to popping out of their bases. I hate using glue because of the interaction with the tile held in the base, but it may be necessary to make the game usable. I've strongly considered at least rebasing them, if not painting, but I'm not sure I have the time to invest given how many figures I own.

Have you bought this game? No? Go buy this game!

I used to be a huge Arkham Horror fan, but as the years have gone by and games have become increasingly streamlined, the hassle of setting up and managing a game put me off wanting to touch the box. Honestly, Cthulhu games just made me start to think 'complicated' and so I stopped touching them.

Then Sanata came from Melbourne and brought this. And I honestly can not be happier with a game. Immersive, threatening without being a douche, fun and streamlined. It's like the gaming gods listened to my plea and created exactly what I was looking for.

The thing that really amazes me is the replayability. I've now completed the beginning mission 4 times (roping all my gaming buddies into trying it), and it hasn't become old. I love that an App controls the big bad and storylines. Just simply fantastic.

This is the most thematic game I have ever played! The gameplay, the narratives, and the atmosphere, everything about this game is amazing! I am giving it 9.5/10. The subtraction of 0.5 is due to the miniature component (the base doesn't fit properly, and one of the legs on the star spawn came off and I had to reattach it).

Like an expensive chose your own adventure book with miniatures.

Explore an icon, get something, repeat.  Occasionally kill a monster.  It tries hard with its beautiful components and app but play is almost devoid of meaningful choices.  Your on the rails and a few die roles are all that matter.

Really happy to buy this to get to use my painted figures from the first edition which was so hard to get played. First two games were ok, but not great, so I need to get the rules read & the faqs reviewed to get more out of it.

29.8.16 Three more plays & it is definitely starting to click. I've rationalised the boxes - all the old game materials stored in the CotW box with the new bits & all tiles & figures in the new one. It just fits so now I want more scenarios for the app but not any more content to go into the box.

I love a good Lovecraft inspired co-op adventure and this absolutely nails it.  Fantastic use of the app (get it linked to your TV for great sound and a good view for everyone at the table).

So much potential, but disappointing so far due to the mostly bland scenarios. The app and game tiles are very atmospheric, and promise a mystery to solve or a horrific story. Usually you just stumble about, find some stuff, and face a big monster at the end. FFG needs to hire some writers to stretch this game in a more creative direction. I still enjoy playing, but inevitably feel a letdown at the climax.  I really hope they invest in some good writers--this could be spectacularly good with the right stories. 

Btw: what’s the deal with the poor minis? We end up playing with just the counters since the bases for the minis are huge and they aren’t that good anyway. 

Update: The Arkham Horror Card Game gets the scenarios right!

RATING: 9
Just had my first play through and it was really nice being able to take part int he investigation and not knowing what was going one. The new streamlined mechanics make things quick to start and learn. The App is great save there a few things that could be clarified when playing. We realized in the second scenario that we had items in the item bag that we could interact with and that gave us valuable info, but the app wasn't a little sparse with giving us the necessary info to know this. The exploring of the world via the app is amazing. Not knowing what is behind the door is a great feeling and adds a lot thematically to the investigation. The flavor text for each area you search is great and I think is my second favorite thing about the game. 

So far I'm enjoying it I'll have to get more games in to really be able to compare it to the first mansions which in my opinion is one of the best rpg style board gaming experiences you can have with a group. 

Lets hope this continues to get better and hopefully they will release new scenarios. 4 is a little sparse even with the "random" replay value they have.

Why bother setting up the awkward and ungainly meatspace game when the version on the computer does all the work for you?  I had the opportunity to play this very innovative game but elements of the group struggled to function through the disconnect between the screen and the board.  I think it will take a few more plays to reach a conclusion on whether or not I like this hybrid experience.

RATING: 8
MoM features most of the ingredients i usually don´t like in a game: An adventure luckbased game with a RPG flavour with a horror theme!

Yet, the master gamer role is here provided by a very good app that, not only saves time, but also adjusts the difficulty and consistency of the story according to the players progress.
The quality of the stories and the environments, the art design (both of the app as in the board), the music and the sound effects, all contribute to allow a great immersion with the theme and a great experience. 
However, there´s still, of course, some dependency on the dice and the players run through a preset story where they can only decide turn left or right, attack or evade, move or explore, etc.
The game also has some obvious problems of replayability (minimized by expansions) and is expensive...but is a heck of a game, that´s for sure!

This is one of my goto Solo games. I enjoy the app controlling one side of the story and attempting to discover the story instead of trying to outsmart some AI (that's saved for other humans). The game is very successful in that respect. Playing with other people feels a lot like watching someone read a book and then tell you about it.

The quality of the miniatures is pretty poor. The whole clunky base with monster chits looks like it was a kitchen sink design decision. I would have rather seen them just keep the monster chits and go with better minis for the investigators. The cardboard pieces and cards are very good and what I would expect from FFG. 

[5 Nov 2017] - 6 (14 plays)
It's a very interesting solo game as the computer takes the place of one of the players. That let's the game tell a compelling story. Despite this, I had to drop the rating. First, I've become less interested in solo gaming. Pulling a computer out on those occasions when I can get a group together isn't as fulfilling. Second, the game needs expansions in order to stay fresh. The cost of the latest expansion is more than I want to keep pumping into a gaming experience for myself. At the rate I'm spending on this game, I could buy a new game console and get the same number of plays out of a solo game.

[29 Dec 2017] - 6 (14 plays)
Sold this as it wasn't getting played and I didn't like the price point for the latest expansions. The quality of the miniatures was the worst part of this game. They were pretty bad and would require a ton of time to just get ok miniatures after painting. I didn't necessarily mind the app driven nature of the game but very often (e.g. during combat), the generic text would get a little tedious and I'd start skimming for numbers instead of reading the whole paragraph. The length of the game and the setup involved just made this a non-starter. I stopped playing after the new game shine wore off.

The app makes it easier no doubt, but it seemed like I was playing the game or acting in a movie they chose for me.  Our team did get into trouble unlocking and opening a door too soon and had a horrific problem with 'monsters' but still managed to figure out and execute the 'win' condition only to find after the game was 'over' and we could do nothing to reverse the issue that in fact we had 'lost' because one of us went insane in the prior turn.  That was a bit of a let down and left us disappointed for it seemed like 2-3 hours of resolving issues and battling, learning rules, figuring things out only to have what felt like an unfair reversal of fortune in the end.  Not a good first impression.  Maybe other games would have been more interesting.

RPG in a box, with no DM and simple rules.  Smothered in theme. Keeps you interested by slowly revealing puzzle elements while cranking up the difficulty as time elapses.  You feel the pressure building as you get closer to solving the mystery, or closer to an untimely death.  So much fun.

RATING: 4
I LOVE this game. I can't think of any other game that was so intense and immersive, with a gripping story, that made you wonder what would happen next, all the time. Unfortunately this game is a complete rip off. The MSRP for the core game is 100$ and it contains exactly four missions. That wouldnt be too bad, if those missions had the same replayabilty as the missions in the first edition. Unfortunately they don't. The story and the core elements of each mission stay exactly the same, there arent even branching story paths any more. If you are lucky and restart the mission, the layout of the map and the monsters that spawn vary (in some levels not even that is the case), but thats it. Unless you enjoy the game mechanic and the challenge of replaying the same level with different characters, there is no real replay value in most of the levels - especially if you are like me, and you are mostly in it for the story. The two digital DLCs are allright, but Asmodee/Heidelberger cant be arsed to translate them into German. What really blows my mind though, are the first two physical Expansions that bring back the tiles and the minis from the first edition core game and big expansions. They are around 50$ each and contain exactly ONE mission, thats 50$ for one ~2h mission, which is ridiculous for a boardgame. The 3rd Expansion (with new content) is way better with 2 Missions for arround 30-35$ and new components, but still is VERY pricey for what you are acctually getting. Translations for the 4th expansion, as always, havent even been announced 2-3 months after the US release. The app itself is pretty primitive as well. Hardly any options, annoying confirmation messages you cant get rid off and no multiple save games. While the app is supported on almost all digital plattforms there is no cross plattform support. So if you get digital DLC on Steam and want to play it on your Apple/ Android device you have to rebuy it again. VERY unimpressive app, especially if you look at Valkyre, a free and improved version, done by only a few guys. The game is still amazing but, Asmodee/FFG/Heidelberger REALLY have to improve the content prizing and the replayability of the missions, as well as improve the app. Which they most likely wont, because this game is a cash cow as it is....Unless you are rich or dont care about replaying the same story over and over again this game is really not worth the investment, if you are not made of money thought you could get easily get 3-4 games with 1000 times the replayability that this game has to offer
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.7
Sadly, this is a contender for the most overhyped game for me.  I mean... top 20?!  The game is far too reliant on the app, but it has to be.  The app does everything but moving minis, dice rolls, and drawing/taking cards.  In other words, the app is ALMOST a standalone digital game (and could be if FFG wanted it to be), but you need to pay $80 or so to get the rest.  

Gameplay... I mean... EVERYTHING is app and dice.  Set up how the app tells you.  Put tokens where the app tells you.  To investigate, press the token on the app and roll dice.  To explore, press the token on the app and roll dice.  To attack, press the monster on the app and roll dice.  To evade, press the monster on the app and roll dice.  After each mythos phase, resolve a horror check by following the instructions on the app and rolling dice.

There aren't many interesting decisions to make.  You need to explore and investigate everything.  

For a game with an app, I was shocked as to how fiddly it was.  Also, it's extremely easy to overlook important actions, abilities, conditions, etc... given how many cards you can have in front of a character at once (items, spells, conditions, horror, damage, etc...).

The theme and narrative is applied fairly well.  The game does bring a sense of dread as you add more monsters and progress with worsening characters.  But, the game feels so long that you may find yourself ignoring the flavor text and looking for the skill check requirements.

If you're looking for a Lovecraft game, I think Arkham Horror LCG is easily the best in the genre.

But, MoM... I mean... #20 of all time?!  Has everyone become... dare I say it... INSANE?!  (BOOM!  MYTHOS JOKES!)

In general apps and games mixing doesn't excite me, in fact the idea turns me off to games, until my loved Mansions of Madness came out with a new edition driven by an app. For the first time I got excited about app integration because finally I was able to enjoy the game from the investigator side (as I was perpetually stuck in the keeper's role) and I could play solo and I could avoid the long setup time. Yet in a strange way as well it doesn't make obsolete the first edition of the game because even though there are improvements across the board there are elements from the first edition that couldn't be captured. Somehow a game was improved without tossing aside the old.

I haven't played the 2011 version, but I can see how much time the app saves. 

After 1 play: the game started out at a pretty good pace, the app helped in expediting the story elements. But as the game went on, the mythos phase took longer and longer until the downtime between turns was just too much. The gameplay got repetitive and after 3.5 hours we had to pack it up about a turn or two before the end.

Overall I'd say this was a fun game, put aside 4 or more hours though. The story is much more interesting and better put together than Betrayal at House on the Hill, but you pay in your time.

I'll never buy the game, but I'll play it again as an event type thing.

As for the app nay-sayers, I get it, but I don't think it's practical to play a game as fiddly as this without either the app or a well experienced group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Less ambitious than the 1st edition but works better and possibly more enjoyable. There isn't really much going on below the surface in this game but I enjoyed my play of it enough, move between rooms rolling skill check dice and dealing with monster bashing combat before you go insane. It gets a plus for being easy to set up and play and a plus for have reasonable writing and narrative by FFG standards. It gets docked points for only having four scenarios, less interesting minis that the first edition and being rather expensive given the two preceding points. The main market here is people who would rather have an app be their GM than a player with an rpg rule book. If you are looking for a board game experience or an rpg with real legs look elsewhere.

Played once with the "Escape the Town" scenario.  It was actually a lot of fun!  It really captures the feel of a point-and-click adventure game, the way the map gets revealed with certain objects you can interact with.  The one thing I wish they hadn't replicated, though, is the idea that you are expected to fail as you figure out what you're supposed to do.  I don't mind that in a video game that only takes 20 minutes, but walking into a 2 hour board game knowing that it's pretty much just a practice game feels kinda lame.  It felt like if we had known ahead of time what we needed to do, we would have won for sure.

This one's slipping quite a bit with every play. It has kickass premise, awesome potential and some good ideas in the game mechanics, but the more you play it the easier it is to peek behind the curtain and realize there's not THAT much there.

Apart from mundane things, like miniature quality and questionable pricing, Mansions of Madness feels a bit rigid, even conservative in tackling its own mechanics. I mean there's so much to explore (pun half-intended), but it seems that most scenarios so far just settle for the rudimentary. It's "kick down the door, search the place, hit the Deep One with a crowbar. Repeat". There's not that much of a mystery to solve, the back story is, well, in the back seat somewhere and as far as the game goes, you just have to focus on Horror checks and blowing monsters up.

That's not very lovecraftian.

Comment:
I always enjoyed playing Mansions of Madness 1st Edition, but it's a shame that it doesn't hit the table as often as it should...

The Second Edition makes almost everything better:
- Streamlined gameplay
- Fully cooperative
- Solo playable
And on top of that FFG put a nice conversion kit inside the box, so that all of us 1st Edition owners could directly use the "old" material for the new scenarios - FANTASTIC!

If you're into thematic, atmospheric, adventure, roleplay, or cthuloid games this will be an absolute hit! If you're not, try it anyway ;-)

I do like this, as does my wife. I have fun playing it, but I did feel like I spent too much time looking at the app vs at the game board... although I was sort of dedicated app guy, so that was probably part of it.

Great production, lots of theme.  Best played with the app stuff cast onto a big TV screen and with the great atmospheric background music properly amplified.  I pity those playing it at a gaming club on a laptop barely visible to one player and no audio.

I love the variable spell side-effects (though that's not new here).

This is just too long for me to want to play very often (~4 hours for first play).  
This may replace betrayal house on the hill, if I could get the play-length down.

Some characters won't have much interesting at all that they can do in some situations, if the team hasn't stuck together and that player is too distant from the action to arrive within range for a round or two.

The app ought to have guided barricade-resolution in with its monster movement resolution in the mythos phase.

The app also ought to have interactive help (click on a word to get a meaning for it).

It'd be nice if the minis fitted and stayed in their stands.

Box is stupidly big.

I’ve been banging the drum for years that HPL games should be fully cooperative so the theme can be fully appreciated by all. That is, there’s not much chance of a happy ending; prepare thyself to make the ultimate sacrifice. Once you introduce egos via a competitive situation, people care more about winning than having a Lovecraft experience and the richness of the genre is lost.  

The first edition never really got off the ground for me and my group but I kept the game around because I saw the possibilities there. To that end, I abandoned MoM 1st edition as competitive and used a fan-made cooperative variant for solo and coop play. It worked well enough to keep the game around.

But then this comes along and takes the game to a new level. I’m writing this comment after playing all the scenarios available to me as an owner of the 1st edition and Forbidden Alchemy expansion. Each one has gotten off the ground in terms of story and tension. The app (with bugs resolved) works great as an AI and mood creator. My tastes are such that I can enjoy each scenario at least twice; once for the discovery and then again to do better. 

Things I particularly like: Setup is a cinch. They streamlined the Horror Checks and the app tracks all checks/attacks. Each story feels different (particularly the mystery that is “Rising Tide”). The potential for new and different stories is vast.

Things I don’t like: The bases of the monsters are not required and cover up the board (I’m going to glue my monsters onto clear bases). I find the traitor mechanic of the Insanity Condition outside my tastes and not viable when controlling two characters apiece. I don’t like that they sell the FA and CotW conversion kits in one $40 box. Those of us who have one or the other have to overpay.

All in all, our plays of this have all been epic in one sense or another with many shouts and groans. At this point all I want is more everything. Really impressed with what they've done with this game especially considering the miss that the first edition was.

Rules notes:
-- A pushed investigator is not moving voluntarily and so would not need to make the evade check. As you note, the investigator doing the pushing would need to evade to perform the push action and evade again should they choose to follow the pushed investigator and leave the space with the monster.

We started and just could not stop playing until we did the 4 campaign scenarios. Very good tension, the App support is awesome and allows all players to play (even if it's better if one reads the texts for the ambiance). Highly recommended.

RATING: 9.5
Mansions of Madness has been updated to include an interactive app feature.

The good: 
The rules were set up to get the players up and playing quickly. The tiles had good visuals and were solid. The game promoted a lot of discussion among the players. Unlike Eldritch Horror, the players have to pay attention to the narrative from the app and investigate to discover what their objective is. We got our butts kicked by the game the first round through, so the game wasn't set up to be too simple.

The not so good: 
If the company ever stops supporting the app, then the game could be bricked. The app replaces all of the action cards that describe what happens to a player. Also, you really need four characters on the board to accomplish all the tasks that are required before everybody dies. Movement is so constricted that getting to other characters or to the site where monsters have appeared is frustrating without adequate characters.

After four plays of this game, it's jumped to my favorites list. I really like how quickly new players can start controlling their turn using the app (negating the need for a game master to continually babysit players' actions). I am curious how much repeat playability there will be with completed scenarios. It seems like the clues weren't necessarily changing play-to-play. But as there are already new scenarios for purchase on Steam, I'm not too worried.

This is the closest experience to and RPG in a board game yet. A perfect use of digital technology. I really can't recommend it enough. The only complaint is there are only 4 scenarios right now (but my guess is there will be a lot more to come).

This one is a masterpiece. I am not a big fan of coop games, but thos one took me back to my childhood, The first scenario gave me the feeling of being 14 again, playing Resident Evil on my Playstation for the first time. Man, I was hooked immediatly. 2nd scenario did the same, but then it reminded me at the first time I played Resident Evil 4 on my GameCube. Damn, this game is good, even in coop with 4 other persons, I still feel the horror vibe and the pressure of completing a scenario. Very very good game, if not best game of 2016.

While I thought Mansions of Madness was a straight upgrade from games like Eldritch Horror, since it has a cohesive storyline and more to do, the app dependence was too jarring and wonky to keep the game in my collection.  I really strongly disliked the "easy to solve but might take a few actions" puzzles, and the "roll dice to see if anything good happens" Fantasy Flight Lovecraft randomfest.  I may have still hung onto this game for those occasional moments when I crave a big epic Cthulhu game, but between Mythos Tales and the excellent Arkham Horror LCG I have plenty of great Cthulhu stories in my life without the dice chucking frustration.

Its certainly very streamlined, set up time is now how long it takes to boot the app and dump the box contents on the table. 
I like how the search tokens now are attributed to something i.e papers strewn on the floor rather than simply dumped in a certain square, and the background noises on the app are very thematic. 

I like the app integration particularly the ability to have investigator specific mythos events. 
I am hoping they do release more and more scenarios as with a single play through we went right through the first scenario and honestly I don't see they replayability in that scenario.

A leghangulatosabb, leginkább beszippantós játék, amivel valaha játszottam. Najó talán a pandemic legacy hasonló szinten volt. :)
Az app szuper ötlet ehhez a játékhoz, az aláfestő zene, a narráció mind-mind nagyon segíti a beleélést. Viszont itt vannak sajnos hibák is: kár hogy csak egy-két szöveget mondtak fel színészek és a nagyját olvasni kell. Még nagyobb kár, hogy emiatt mindenkinek folyamatosan nézni kell az appot, ami egy tableten nagyon kényelmetlen. Minimum monitor, de inkább tv/projektor kéne hozzá, hogy kényelmesen játszható legyen. Ezek sokat elvettek az élményből, de az a durva, hogy még így is maradt belőle rengeteg, szóval alapjaiban ez egy szuper játék, csak figyelni kell a körülményekre.

Sajnos módosítanom kell az álláspontomat. A második játék erősítette a gyengéket és elhalványította az erősségeket. Rettenet hosszú, ráadásul tervezhetetlen a játékidő, mert az app a felét hazudja a valósnak. Nem tudom, mi értelme ennek. Igazából nincsenek megoldandó rejtélyek. Vagy időben jó helyre lépkedsz tök véletlenül vagy nem, és buksz. A szörnyek irreálisan erősek, lehetetlen megküzdeni velük. Ha egy-egy elkap, akkor annyi. A szövegek olvasgatása továbbra is nagy nehézség egyszerre 4-5 embernek. Óhatatlanul, na dobj egy sanitychecket oszt menjünk tovább lesz belőle igen hamar. Kár érte... :(

Great game if you're looking for a good story set in Lovecraftian universe. Very easy to pick up, you can essentially start playing right away and explain the game as new areas are revealed.

The puzzles are mixed bag. The sliding puzzle is pretty obvious and easy to figure out, then it's just a matter of going through the motions. The image puzzle a bit less so but still predictable. The code puzzle is the most interesting. I would have liked if they were all on the same level of challenge, which should have been easy to accomplish considering how many puzzle games have already been invented before ;)

The biggest problem I have with the game is it's rather simplistic approach on creating a challenge. The game just throws horror and damage at you until you die, forcing you to restart and optimize from past plays (i.e. run through the mansion again collecting critical items as fast as possible to complete the scenario and ignoring search tokens yielding clues or common items) First plays in which you discover new areas are great, subsequent feel too much like a grind.

The production value is really good, nice art work, miniatures and app. It all creates a coherent and immersive world. The story elements were also quite ok, even though the story is super predictable in the end when a huge monster with tentacles appear (who could have guessed that!?). 

So why is the game mechanisms so bad? 
1. You are doing a mission with a strict time limit that you do not know. And when you get to know it you have no chance of still winning. 
2. Search everywhere to find everything, no way to know where to search or go, you just need to do everything. 
3. Random events that could easily kill you for no reason at all. 
4. There is no real strategy in the game.
5. The rules are way too complex for how simple the game is. We spent a good part of the game looking up rules explanations for thing that happen. 

I had a good experience with this game. But it is far from a good game, in fact the best part of it is master mind. So I would rather play master mind than play it again.

Disclaimer: don't love HP Lovecraft or this type of game.  This is better "House on Haunted Hill."  A couple of problems with it: the person who's playing the app is truly just playing the game by themself.  This game would work best with one player.  Also, everyone else sitting around while someone solves a puzzle on their phone is super boring.  It's why we ban phones at the table - we're trying to play this game together.  The story we played was VERY generic: cult spawns tentacle monster.  Ugh.  It's basically roll and move - there's no strategy and very little decision making.  Very susceptible to alpha gaming.  What this game has over Arkham and others like it: much faster, phone sound effects add ambiance.  Good production values on the tiles/cards.  Interesting insanity mechanism gives you a hidden weakness. If you like this type of game, I'm sure you'll love this but if you don't like HP Lovecraft or this sort of Amerithrash gaming, this won't change your mind.

I would rate this game much higher if the game didn't have traitor insanity mechanics. As it is, playing a 4h+ coop game only to sacrifice yourself for the team but then become a traitor and lose. Or you become a traitor and screw everyone else

If they just made insanity cards that were disadvantages but not changing the win condition of the game, that would have been perfect. But as is, it is a HUGE issue I have with the game. Everything else is awesome! (well not the mini quality but that doesn't affect gameplay)

I use a homebrew insanity rule when I play now. When insane, a player can't perform the same action twice on their turn (same as another insanity card). They also flip over all mental damage and keep any that have ongoing effects instead of discarding those.

Takes a LONG time, and the miniatures are useless (we just play with the tokens). And there isn't a ton of replayability... I can't see going through any single scenario more than twice, and some not more than once.
BUT, all that being said, the thematic immersion is incredible, and it is a blast to play a scenario the first time. So as long as they keep expanding, I'll keep playing.

This game is unlike any other I have ever played--and it's awesome!  At first I thought I wouldn't like the app because I like the purity and tactile nature of of board games, but the app integrates seemlessly.  It becomes a part of the game not just a distraction.   It really create a mood and feeling of exploring a haunted mansion rpg-style.  I loved not knowing what was around the next corner or through the next door.  The dice checks created a lot of tense, and yes miserable, moments, but also some great cheers after a crucial success.  This game gets only my 5th "10" rating.  I know FFG will not disappoint with future expansions and scenarios.

I'm just not a fan of dungeon crawlers (too few ahead planning, too much randomness). And I don't see why actually a board is needed for this game.

The game is all about theme and that is a good thing. The production quality is quite good except the stands for the mini's don't hold them very well. I found the gameplay to be a tad long and it seemed that there could be some streamlining in the system in general. I can see where using the app on a tablet with one player controlling it might work out better, on a large screen it seemed distracting and it felt a little out of place. It felt a little like you were being led through the game rather than actually making real decisions but perhaps that is part of the charm.

The box should say, "for 4-5 investigators"  When the rule-book says, "if you're playing solo pick two investigators," that is completely wrong!  It is Mechanically impossible to win with only two investigators! Saying this game can be done solo is like saying you can play Pandemic solo, it can be done but you need to keep track of four separate characters and their cards. 
Getting past that and how angry it makes me, this is a very enjoyable, but hard experience, with a great app.

Big disappointment - MoM first edition was innovative, compelling, though with flaws. MoM 2nd edition removes the flaws, but also removes nearly all decision-making and gameplay, kind of like what happens to food that becomes fat-free, sugar-free, and gluten-free in the 'wrong' way - yuck.  Too simple, no 'delicious decisions', too much set-up time (every time a room is entered), unnecessary, overlong combat text that is trying too hard to be thematic, plus on top of all that a high price tag with FFG's signature lack of a storage solution.  Unless you are a diehard casual gamer that finds most games too hard, avoid this game and instead get a great Arkham Horror game (like Arkham Horror, Eldritch Horror, or my favourite Arkham Horror: The Card Game).  If you really like the tactical scale of MoM, I recommend Gloomhaven (it's not Cthulhu-themed, but it's extremely good - best fantasy dungeon crawl to date).

Exceptional atmosphere and beautiful components (except the the black bases, which look quite ugly on the board). The app works well and there is a great sense of mystery and progression. It is true that, when you think about it, choices don't matter much and there is a lot of dice rolling. The writing, however, is really good, it's where the immersiveness of the game comes from. I highly enjoy playing Mansions of Madness, but I have concerns about replayability. The core box only contains four scenarios, which is not much for such a high price. Having said this, playing MoM is a terrific experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I will not rate this edition since I do not own it (I own and enjoy the 1st edition). However, a note to anyone considering this edition: MoM 2nd edition cannot be played without the digital companion app. While an app offers some nice advantages, like the ability for all players to play cooperatively and easy content delivery, it also means that your ability to play this game is at the mercy of your device/OS maker's upgrade cycle and FFG's commitment and ability to maintain the app long-term. 

It's not that I don't trust FFG to want to do the right thing. I own and enjoy many FFG titles, and I know that they have the best intentions of making and supporting a great game. But the business incentives simply don't exist for any publisher to ensure that games with apps are well-supported in the future. 

FFG is a business that must sustain itself, and like any business, it must ultimately make decisions based on self-interest. Because it is expensive to develop and maintain software for multiple platforms across multiple upgrade cycles, there is the need for an ongoing revenue stream to support an app-ified game. This fact means an app like this one will only be well-supported while the game and new content delivered via the app are selling well.

Once those revenue streams slow down, the incentive to maintain the app diminishes, and it becomes a distraction and opportunity cost for the publisher. This means there is a fair chance that your app-ified board game will be unsupported when a new device/OS upgrade is released, or when the publisher has a bad quarter.

Put another way, given a choice between maintaining an app for an older game that generates little or no ongoing profit, or putting money into developing the new hotness, which choice do you think any self-interested publisher would make?

As a recent example, take the debacle that was Golem Arcana, a highly touted, app-based game that was discontinued less than 2 years after its debut, and after selling expensive expansion after expansion in the meantime, which should have subsidized app maintenance.

Now, given its scenario-based design, MoM is probably one of the few games where selling additional content on an ongoing basis via an app makes sense, but I for one do not want publishers to focus on producing a slew of low-grade content in lieu of great games. Nor do I want them to design games that are highly content-oriented (usually correlated with mediocre game design).

I'm not saying don't buy this game--I'm sure it's a great game and it looks to have some really cool elements that only an app could provide. But IMHO, it is better for players and the industry for board games to be published according to a discrete, project-based model, where ongoing support and investment are not required. I urge you to know what you're getting into, and second, consider if you want to support this general practice by publishers before voting with your hard-earned money.

Finally, for what it's worth, I do believe that this is one salvo in a grand experiment by FFG/Asmodee to determine if it can dissuade gamers from thinking of board games as durable, infinitely replayable goods, and instead convince them that they are disposable, ephemeral experiences worth paying for again and again. Whatever choice you make, it will pave the way for more of the same in the future.

Expected it to be too similar to Eldritch Horror (which I loved) but was pleasantly surprised! Looking forward to replaying it when I have the time and will intend to pick up the expansions in future. Wasn't a 10 due to the steep pricing, but if you like adventure/co-op games (like me), this is a buy!

Another play, another rating drop. This game is simply not for me. It takes forever to set up on the table. Searching for tiles when new rooms come out break the immersion. More importantly, there are few tough choices and the game takes FOREVER to play. Every time we have played, I just wanted the game to end. That's a sign of a game I have to get out of my collection and I will be doing just that.

RATING: 9.5
Most thematic and immersive game I've ever played. The app is great for that.Poor miniature quality lose this game half a point.

Not sure how much time I'll get out of the remaining three scenarios and their replayability, but it seems like a great overall package so far. Looking forward to its expansions.

Edit: Played the 4th scenario and it was even better. Got about 7 hours out of it but it was engaging the entire time and it flew by with its setup. Haven't experienced anything like it before. Awesome investigation and light on monsters in the beginning. Still won first try which was nice with such a long one but I hope the others will take me multiple tries.

RATING: 7.8
First edition: five scenarios
Second edition: four scenarios 
More scenarios please! At least one to be on par with first edition (in every language)
The incl. Conversion Kit adds to the price of this core game but is useless until you have 1st ed or buy expansions, therefore and to be fair, it should have been sold separetely! Some of the monster minis just don't stick to their base. Your character may be stuck when caught by one or two monsters; you can't break away or kill the monster, while the monster can't kill you... so the game may drag until you're helped.
The app is good but still has a lot of potential to be improved:
- The narrative is only read aloud for the intro, more please
- Background music is great but short and very soon starts to repeat, more please
- There a few sound effects when something happens, more please
- Every investigator has 2 actions but the app does not count it when you play
- The scenarios have a fixed difficulty even though the app should be able to scale it
- When there is fire (which spreads) the app is not able to track and display.

RATING: 9
The only thing I did not like about Mansions 1st Ed. was the very long setup time.  The addition of the app to manage that aspect removes 95% of the setup, which is awesome.  Just be sure to not let the app overshadow the board, something we noticed happened in the first couple of games as people are drawn to the shiny new app rather than looking at the table.  I now keep the app to myself to manage the game, apart from the intro/ending scenes.

I can see why this game is so famous among some people. But just not my cup of tea. Going to contradict myself here though - i will still occasionally play it and if there is any Cathullu or Lovecraft based co-op Ameritrash I want to play among many others - this would be it.

RATING: 9
The best co-op board game I have found yet. There are a lot of great mechanics in this game that are already covered by other reviews, but what needs to be highlighted is the element of surprise/randomness that will keep the replayability high. For instance, your character can gain conditions that have lasting effects through out the game that can affect which actions you are allowed to perform or even altering the way you win.. but you aren't allowed to tell your other players that! How cool is that? There are also 8 unique investigators for you try and the app randomizes the placement of the very detailed and well constructed tiles each time you play. No scenario is ever exactly the same. This combined with the exploration, puzzles, combat and detective work makes it feel like multiple games wrapped into one. And on top of all that the app does a great job of keeping everything tracked and organized for you, including theme music and sound effects. 

The only reason I don't give this a 10 is that I was a bit let down by the miniatures. I understand this was a test run so they most likely just re purposed older methods from the original, but as someone who owns both Descent and Imperial Assault these are a big step down. They are flimsy and small, the investigators lack detail, and the bases for the monsters are a game in itself trying to get them to fit and stay. Pro tip: Some of the bases have different sized holes for the proper figures, figuring this out helps but some still have trouble fitting/staying in their proper base. On top of that, you slide the monster card into the base and then have to flip the base over (with the figure sometimes falling out) to see the flavor text/special abilities. They really should have had the ability on the front with the description on the bottom for reference. But that being said, they are still above the quality we see in a lot of other games, just with FFG the bar is set high so I think they missed the mark just a bit. 

The other side is the price, I paid a similar price for IA and felt that I got more out of it, including the skirmish side of the game. The campaign is longer in terms of hours of play, has a great replayability and I found the flavor text/writing to be superior. But it is a bit like comparing apples and oranges (Imperial player versus co-op with app), however dollar for value IA is better. But content wise it almost feels like they are charging you for the included conversion kit to bring the 1st edition stuff into play.. even if you don't own any 1st edition stuff, so that ticked me off a bit.

BUT if you are looking for a Co-Op game, this is it, look no further you have found it. Just be prepared to work with the minis a bit and if you can find a sale price, although that will probably have to wait for the second or third print at this point.

I've played the first scenario and enjoyed it.  It was a bit fiddly in terms of having to reference the rules often, and the scenario lasted way longer than the 60 - 90 minutes that is indicated.  I think that was a major turnoff for my group, because as we hit the 3 hour mark, they were ready for it to end.  Advertised play time is very misleading in this game.

However, I'm eager to play again, which is always a good sign.  Will update as I play more.

Now that's the kind of game I love. Has RPG mechanics twisted in a new and fun way and the app works really well as a GM and keeping track of everything happening with the players and monsters. I love tile placing games and the scenarios are very fun to play - I will definitely buy expansions when I run out of scenarios!
The mechanics for combat and actions are simple enough and don't drag.

The board and cards art are really great but the minis could have been better - the first edition has minis which the quality is visibly superior.

Playing alone is incredibly fun. I found myself cursing at my dice roll and cheering when I found some great item in the mansion. The game is very hard, but I do like it this way. Overall, an amazing game!

Mansions of Madness är ett samarbetsspel med ett starkt berättarelement. Vi har redan den första versionen och den största skillnaden är att numera tar en app över rollen som spelledare. Det är mindre regeltungt, mindre fippligt och har mer story. Det är ett bra val på grund av att det är en unik spelupplevelse. De största reservationerna jag har är hur omspelbart spelet egentligen är och att man vill använda en surfplatta då man spelar det (vet inte om det går på telefoner). Alla har med sig telefoner, men har man inte med sig en platta kan man inte spontanspela det. Vi kan använda brickor och figurer från första versionen i detta spel om vi bestämmer oss för att köpa in det.

This game could easily be an 8 with a tendency to a 9. BUT the quality of the miniatures and the high pricing for this, will lower this rating to what it is. does FFG don't have a quality management? Didn't FFG evolved in mini quality? and when they say, using the same shitty minis from 2011 because that has a historic tradition, it's just a cheapskate apology to rip off his customers with minis that were already not great 5 years ago. This game is killing me. I LOVE it and I HATE it on the same time. And for people who don't have the 1st edition stuff: don't waste your money.

A beautiful game with marvellous artwork and great miniatures. It requires a big investment of time to play but it is well worth it. Replay value is very good, even if you have succeeded at a scenario as there is enough randomisation to make it interesting to replay scenarios.

Limited stories and bad value/price. Low replayability unless you invest to get all the expansions. Gameplay feels rushed and doesn't give you the feeling of investigating.

This game OOOZES theme. If you like horror survival adventures, or let alone you already like Lovecraft's books, this is a great experience. Being hunted by unspeakable horrors through burning mansions, only to decide at the door you aren't leaving just yet, because you became a little insane on the way - fantastic. The app does wonders to eliminate all worries about setup and consistency - with my only regret being that I may have spent more time looking at our tablet than contemplating the board. So my recommendation would be to let one player (maybe in turns) act as app-master, read the events, and everybody else focus on the beautiful cardboard and miniatures.

One word: wow.  I wasn't sure what to expect here.  I'm a big fan of the First Edition and, after Runebound and the Descent app, it's safe to say I was a bit concerned.  Luckily it turned out just as good as it was pitched.  At it's best, the cooperative aspect is stronger than I'd expected and the app worked wonderfully.  It can't replace the First Edition entirely, but that really is okay.  For those concerned, you can still have a Keeper player.  Give one player the tablet and they can do the narration, handling the interface, and board setup.  Unexpected, but worked rather well.  Oh, and a bonus, the Conversion Kit comes with the base set which is a nice touch, and it's easy to integrate your First Edition components (tiles, characters and monsters).

Honestly, the strongest part is the one with the most contention: the app.  I experienced bugs that have since been patched, nonetheless a problem with relying on an app, but otherwise this really is the centerpiece of the experience.  Since it takes care of most of the setup and running of the game, the players really only need to know a few rules to play which made our first game quick to get into despite needing to reference the rules as new situations arose.  That meant when we picked up a new player it just as easy for them to jump in, a nice touch.  Unfortunately this seems to mean the manual is a bit lighter as a result.  The book doesn't seem to address what to do when multiple characters, for example, are all valid targets for a Mythos effect or monster attack.

While it's the centerpiece, that means it's also needs to work perfectly.  When it crashes or freezes there is no way to get back to your game and yes, we experienced this twice.  It is utterly frustrating.  The app is also a gate keeper to additional content and there is no way to set up your own scenarios.  This may not bug everyone but it's definitely worth noting since it also means you can't add content at all, even official, unless the app specifically allows for it ( ie: multiple base sets or expansions ).  Not to mention even if the random missions work well, you'll want new stories and you can't do them yourself.  That means Fantasy Flight will either go the DLC route, which I have mixed feelings towards, or they'll do smaller expansions which coincide with updates to the app, which I have mixed feelings on, or a combination of the two.  The potential is there to add updates which add new puzzles and scenarios but since we don't know how that will be used, I remain cautiously optimistic.  Here's hoping we get some sort of scenario editor as well.

Overall though, my concerns do not get in the way of the game.  It's tons of fun to play, comes highly recommended and I really hope the Second Edition gets plenty of love.

Still getting the feel to the game after only 2 plays. I

The app is very nice. I wish it would have incorporated a few more things however. When they tell you that the lights go out in certain areas, or a fire started in a certain area, it would have been nice to have it in the app, and the ability to add barricades in the map. Adding new tiles is a bit of a pain as they have text over it in the app so it can be hard to see how its set up.

The molded pieces are low quality compared to the price.

Other than those gripes, I am liking the game, and will write more when I get more plays under my belt.

Another app-boardgame hybrid from FFG to get the most money from both marketgroups, keep printing costs down and adoring itself towards buzzword-loving investors.

+ I guess it made some rich guy a little richer and provided job experience for some people. 

+ It has some nice artwork, regurgitated from a bunch of other games. 

+ It has a really big, empty box that your cat will love! 

+ I suppose having ugly, wobbly miniatures instead of markers, a dull voice over and an uninspired syntheziser score on repeat, might help some people who otherwise lack imagination to feel more invested in the game. 

- For us, however, it didn't add anything but a hefty price tag and mild amusement for novelty's sake. We'd rather read the text out loud and provide our own soundtrack. Unfortunately, we still have to pay for the crap that FFG force upon us.

- The app is awful. On a high end pad it still crashes often and has a ton of graphic and gameplay bugs. 

- The app sucks battery power more than a FFG executive can leech itself to a lucrative IP.  

- Despite marketed as a dungeon explorer/monster basher, the app forces you to play in-app puzzle games whether you find those tedious or not. 

- Takes forever to play. 

- Gives you the task to fiddle around with cards, when those could have been handled by the app. When that app so clearly wants to be a computer game, it feels kind of sad to not let it fulfill its dreams. 

- Random set ups that doesn't work well with scripted events. Either this is an amateurish mistake or a cynical attempt to provide 'replay value'. 

- Suffers from classical FFG game design in that it rewards min-maxing your resource managment and character selection. 

- Inspired by the modern age of customer responsibility dodging, the rule book refers any technical rules problems to the app, which of course doesn't respond to your rules question in other ways than crashing. 

- The only African-American person in the game is white. 

- Despite all the clues and exploration options, your best bet to win the game is to surge forward to the last room tile asap, killing or avoiding monsters in your way.

Played a demo of this game at the FFG GenCon booth yesterday, led by mythos rock star and designer of the excellent first edition Corey K. In the life of a long term game geek, this was truly a 'brushes with fame' moment!

I was leery of FFG adding an app to a game dripping with theme; But, was surprised and happy to find that the game not only retained its immersive nature, but that the app enhanced this attribute. The app also did not replace the need for the game map and investigator miniatures physically laid out before the players. Lots of laughter and collaboration between investigators. Outstanding game.

This is my kind of "dungeon crawl." Of course, I love Cthulhu. What brings this down a peg is the app integration and components. For the app, more of the in-game text should have been narrated. This would have really helped with the immersion. Also, the miniatures are not great, and it is very frustrating trying to fit them into their bases. Still a great game.

I love this game!! I want more of it anyway I can get it!! But therein lies the problem. Absolutely love the integration with the app that really allows you to dive deeply into the story, gives a whole new experience from your standard board game of this style (even more so then other FF games), and gives you really good immersion into the mythos itself. However I'm the type of board game player that will certainly play each and every storyline available on the app probably even multiple times. It is very wonderful that they change monsters, floor plans, and even minor story elements to make replay different every time, but really sad they did not include the traditional Overlord option of 1st edition or other Fantasy Flight games like Descent. It takes away the ability to run it like a competitive style game which can be lots of fun too!! Of course you can still create your own stories and run it as you would a full fledged role-playing game (assigning monsters, creating plotline,even adding traps), but again no information was really provided for this leaving a lot to trial and error and improvisation to keep it fun yet still fair. Having access to things like Overlord Cards* from FF's Descent just allowed the person "running" the game to be more engaged during game play by throwing in small advantages and environment changes by reacting to player choices. I know it's probably just a personal preference, but just seems like they already had the framework there from 1st edition. For the cost of the game (MSRP $99.95) I would think an extra booklet and a handful of cards would be well within reason and more than appreciated.

RATING: 7
I've only played it twice, so the rating might change after a few more plays, i rated it 7, it might go up to 8 after a few more plays. I do really like the atmosphere and story in the games. Like someone said, it's a bit like role playing on a board game. I do like the app, and it's kind of handy when using a  with screen mirroring to the TV, so everyone can see what's happening, not just the guy using the app.

We've allready had some epic stories in the game, huge twists because of insanity etc. so that part I actually like. Even though it can mean that in a co-op game only one player wins. I think that's hilarious. 

The playing time for the game... It does take a long time and sometimes the progress seems slow, but that's ok. If you like a story driven game of mystery, this is for you. If you would just rather go around hacking and slashing monsters (quickly), this is not the game you are looking for and if some of the investigators just do that, I think it takes a lot away from the game.

I was a bit dissapointed with the quality of the figures though. Some of them have a hard time staying in the bases and some are too tight to fit in them. A few are a bit bent and twisted. For the time being I removed the monster figures from the box and just play with the cardboard markers for monsters.

I was a little nervous the app would curl my tentacles, but it turns out the app succeeds at blanketing the game experience with deep swirling mists of theme and convenience. The 1st edition integration kit, full co-op and solo play add even more  unspeakable goodness to the mix. It all adds up to a mansionlicious 10!

The first time I played this, I thought it was a brilliant game. It's like a better version of Betrayal on the Hill. You really have a sense of time is running out in the game and the sense of dread from impending doom. The difficulty and rules complexity is slightly easier than Eldritch Horror. In fact the rules can be explain as the game is played. 

However the more I play MoM, the more I realize we're basically playing an app with the tabletop components showing some pretty crappy miniatures. This game can be played entirely in the app! The scenarios are also released at a slower rate than I expected. For some reason, the newer scenarios are not as engaging as the earlier ones. Sure it adds some innovative mechanics but it almost always ends up with a big battle. Wish FFG will pick up the pace on this one.

The second edition is an improvement, using a computer aid to handle the gamesmaster role so all the players can be fully coop.  It also speeds up play by keeping track of a lot of the situation, presenting puzzles, and providing atmosphere.  The scenarios and the game components are high quality.  It provides an RPG experience without a GM and so is nice from that standpoint.  On the other hand, without a GM the role-playing aspect is quite absent.  In general, I'd much rather play Call of Cthulhu with a GM to get the full RPG experience.  It's also a less satisfying boardgame experience than Arkham Horror or Edritch Horror since the scope of strategic decisions and powerups is much more limited.  So as a hybrid between RPG and boardgame I find it less satisfying then either.  That said, if someone wants to play it, I'm willing.  It's just not my first choice.

I played first edition once, and that scenario felt like it was on rails. My comments suggest that setup was also long and fiddly. The app takes care of setup and handling many of the fiddly details that took so long in first edition. The scenario we played in second edition was much better, which may just be the scenarios and not an edition difference. We did run into a problem with the device running the app, which wasn't the app's fault but does call attention to the absolute need to have the app.

RATING: 7
I am old-fashioned and skeptical of the use of electronic devices in board games. I guess I still am, but MoM solves the board/computer game integration almost to perfection: The resulting game is undeniably still very much a board game, with the app being used partly to handle the fiddly bookkeeping parts of the game, and partly to introduce secrets and surprises to the game.

The resulting mix works great, and playing the game is a lot of fun.

Great Cthulhu-Game, really like the app. Nice touch with the music, makes the puzzels more fun and everything can more easily be randomised. The solution with the monster minis with their tile beneath the base is a little clunky. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is much, much better than Betrayal at House on the Hill, thanks to the app handling the tedious busy work and the resolution system that doesn't seem as wildly random. 

I feel like the app gives it kind of a black box quality though. The players don't actually know the rules of the game they're playing. An example is the combat system, which seems to be based on a randomly selected attribute, as far as I can tell. I don't know, because the app is handling all that. So when my high strength character suddenly attacks with her lowest attribute, I can only shrug and accept that the game is largely beyond my control and understanding. I guess that's a trend lately, and a sense of powerlessness isn't inappropriate for a horror game. Still not sure if I'm entirely on board with that. 

Hopefully it doesn't become a dominant trend, but it's still fun here.

RATING: 9
Excellent presentation and atmosphere. Don't let the requirement for an App scare you; it actually makes the whole set-up, tear-down, and game management process smoother. The only real downside is the miniatures, while don't really fit well in the bases (and certainly don't stay there). The game can actually just be played without them as well, as the game-related data is on cardboard tiles you plug into the bases anyway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Taking MoM 1st edition and removing all the fiddly dungeon master bits and replacing it with an app. The app handles monsters for you and generating a random layout as you explore the mansion. The biggest issue with the gripe with the app is it's easy to misclick and there's no back or undo button. Much better replayability in 2nd edition as the layout changes so even the same scenario plays out differently each time.

Otherwise it's the same as 1st edition in terms of what the investigators are doing on their turns.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2016)

Cthulhu mythos is one of my favorite themes, so when FFG does a game about it, I just have to buy it :D. I have played and liked Mansions of Madness before and I was expecting more of the same, but the app REALLY catapult it to the next level. I’m very impressed by it!

Mansions of Madness: Second Edition is an easy game to teach, you can do it under 10 minutes. Playtime is long, perhaps too long for what it offers. Due to this, I think it is best with 3 players, with more the downtime begins to be too much.

The decisions continue to be easy and (for the most part) obvious, but as Mansions of Madness: Second Edition is a thematic game you don’t mind much.

I´m a bit saddened that no player can be the Keeper now, that´s always my role in the games and I enjoy it very much. Still the app can be a better Keeper (due to all the procedures needed) and it is neat to solve puzzles on it, besides it solves the issue that if the Keeper made a mistake during the setup, the game was broken. It is also very cool that you don’t setup all the map at the beginning, the app lets you know which tiles goes where (just like the first Descent used to do). I really hope they translate the app soon to Spanish as many friends aren’t comfortable with English. 

I love that the game comes with different scenarios, but it comes with one less than the previous edition, however, with the app I think (but I’m not sure) that every play is very different. I LOVE that you can use the first edition materials in it and the game already comes with an upgrade ready for it :thumbs up:.

The production values are very high as is usual from FFG, some of my miniatures came with the base damaged though. Inserting the square monster tokens into the bases is hard because they are very tight, if you make a mistake here undoing it is hard, besides the tokens aren’t used in the game as the app supplied all the information.

The game is indeed expensive game but for what comes in the box (it is full of cards, cardboard and miniatures) it is worth it.

I never play solo games, but as the app does all the upkeep, perhaps I will give it a shot.

[o]
•	I love that the big baddies (Star Spawns?) do make an appearance in the very first scenario :D.
•	I’m ambivalent by the insanity goals. When a player goes insane he receives a new goal and he can win alone, become a traitor or lose alone even if he helped the group all along. I’m not sure how I feel about this, but it is definitely thematic (perhaps I’m biased as in my game I was the only player who lost due to this :D). I need more plays to verify.
[/o]

Bottom line, Mansions of Madness: Second Edition is an impressive thematic game. My desire to play it again is very high. The app works flawlessly and I hope it fixes the very low replay value of the previous incarnation of the game (FFG can add more scenarios just updating the app). I think I will buy all its expansions.

This game is fantastic. It takes all the things I love from games like Betrayal at House on the Hill and everything I love in games like Elder Sign and Eldritch Horror. You explore the mansion through one of the scenario's to uncover random events and ultimately solve the case. The way the mansion is setup is also random every time you play. What makes this game so amazing and so immersive though is the use of the app on an IPad. The app randomizes the events, the mansion, and even the items that you will encounter throughout the scenario. The game begins with the app reading aloud an intro to the players and then going straight into the game while playing ambient background music. Now I'm not going to explain how the entire game is played, however, it is simple but extremely fun and immersive while you search for clues to complete your end game goal.  Plus the best part is that the app does all the book keeping for you while letting you roll your own dice. The app/ game integration is amazing. I highly recommend this one!

2016-11-06 - 8 might be a tad high for this game, but I've played it twice and I would definitely suggest it, so an 8 it is. The game is pretty and fun, and it's a rare thing for me, because it's a game that I actually really feel the theme in. I'm not crazy about the random events, and it is very oppressive, but I had a lot of fun playing it.

Miniatures aside, this is a top shelf, dark and engaging cooperative game filled with narrative, choices and horror. From a graphic design standpoint there are few board games that look better. Mansions of Madness 2nd Edition's mechanics are straightforward and players rarely will get bogged down in rules and confusion which has hampered other games in the Lovecraft universe. If only the mini's and their sloppy bases fit together properly this would be a benchmark game. Still, anyone seeking to explore the depths of madness with (or without) companion should check this fantastic game out.

Really great game! The painting of the figures really improved the feeling. Too bad that there are only four mysteries in the game box, I don't know about how much I want to play the game afterwards. On the other hand there are also DLC and expansions. One setback is that there are some negative loops which can ruin the game. Also, playing with at least three investigators is almost neccecary for some of the mysteries.

After much soul-searching I've come to admit that Fantasy Flight just doesn't produce a product that I'm going to be interested in playing. I am very much sick of any game where lots of little cards affect lots of other little cards or special cases themselves have special cases.  At least this version has an app to automate some of the otherwise interminable operations.  These sorts of games have none of the skill of board games and lack any of the good narrative of an RPG.   These sorts of experiences simply aren't worth my time anymore.

Was skeptical of this due to the app reliance, but I am completely over that now.  This is so much better than what I originally fell in love with in Betrayal at House on the Hill for.  Very immersive, quite challenging and a great (less random)experience than Betrayal.

RATING: 8
My wife and I are really enjoying this as a 2p co-op. I rate this as a 8-10 the first time each scenario, but my enthusiasm is in the 6-8 range the second/third time through.  There are many questions of replayibility/value. For me, it is worth it just to play through each scenario until we beat it, and then pull it out again when we have different player counts/groups. Bonus value if you want to paint the minis (which my wife somewhat unexpectedly is excited to give a try, but she is the crafty/artistic one).  

I will likely collect all of the second edition expansions and possibly the tile/mini sets if I'm still eager for more.

Most of the scenarios are a bit on the long side for my taste, but then there's the save function. Love that I don't have to be the bad guy! (Though in my first game I ended up as one anyways) GREAT FUN!

The game is thematic, and fairly interesting, unfortunately I feel the app ruins the boardgame aspect. It is more of a computer game, with the just players mimicking what was on-screen with cardboard components. The searching for cardboard rooms/tokens also added a lot of time to the game, leading me to think this would be better played on the app (without any cardboard parts at all).

One of the most fun and memorable board games I've played this year. Was skeptical about having an "app" act as the DM, but it works rather well. Our group played one of the harder scenarios -- our characters had all gone mad, and all but one was injured. We still ended up winning, no fatalities. It was a super rewarding experience, especially since none of us had played the scenario or were DM-ing. I really liked that we all got to figure it out together.

This is a fun game.  There is a bit of fiddlyness with all the cards to manage but that's the nature of this type of game and it doesn't seem to adversely affect the experience.  This has a slight similarity to Betrayal at House on the Hill as far as exploring the mansion is concerned but it's better.  And this is far better than Arkham Horror.

The app seems to work pretty well and though I loathe to have apps or other technology infringing into my board gaming, this is one case where it makes for a worthwhile experience.  I'm looking forward to playing this game again and again.  I'm being drawn in.  The group you play with affects the level of enjoyment.

This game is just brilliant. The app allowing this to be played solo or fully co-op changed this game from a game I really liked but barely ever got to play to one of my favorites. It isn't so much a game anymore as a palpable experience. Bravo FFG!

Pretty good for one of these games, by which I mean a game where you don't really make any gameplay decisions, and most outcomes are borne out by rolls of dice. The app is interesting, but puzzles leave the rest of the table twiddling their thumbs for what feels like an eternity while the person trying to solve it stares at their phone. Not sure this is the right direction for board games to be heading.

Bought this game due to the hype when it first release. Base game only come with 4 free scenarios in the app, definitely over priced especially it lacks of replayability. After trying a few lovecraft games (elder sign, arkham horror card game and this), I finally realize that I never like/understand the concept of Cthulhu theme game  (role dice for test, go insane, etc). I hardly find the scenarios horrifying nor interesting. 
Great idea for the app integration, but still, not the game for me.

Really nice components except for the monster bases. Fun and easy play mechanics. But on the negative side, the flavor text in the game is not very good written and tends to be a bit repetetive. My most major concern is the lack of replayability. Once you played though all the scenarios, the game is done. I really wish that FFG will release a custom scenario designer software tool.

I like the idea of having helper apps. 
But requiring an app in order to even be able to play is a no go.

What is next? Requiring an ffg/asmodee account and link your proof of purchase number in order to be able to use the required apps linked to that account?

10-24-2016 - Ok, 2 plays in and it's settled.  This is the best game in the freaking world.  It's exactly what I want in my ideal game.  Well, almost...

The good:  Exploration that feels meaningful, upgrading your character, asymmetrical powers, cooperative goals, totally immersive, twists and turns that completely change the game, not too easy and not too hard, FUN, I want to play this thing over and over.

(I just finished these comments, reading back over them now, and I realize I never mentioned the app!  So more "the good:"  The app is great, it works really well, adds to the experience and lessens in-game complication, though it seriously - SERIOUSLY - needs a Back button!)

The bad:  I'm worried about replay value after getting through all the scenarios (but we're pretty far from that right now) and the horror checks at every Mythos can get a little tedious IMHO.  The biggest "negative" for me that I really don't care that much about: although I can customize my character with equipment (AWESOME), I can only do it with equipment I FIND.  If I don't FIND a cool weapon, I don't GET a cool weapon.  I mean, there will be weapons around, and someone will find one, and trading is pretty open if you're in the same spot with another investigator, but I like games where I save up some currency and buy a super cool weapon.  You're at the mercy of what's included in the scenario in MOM2, and it makes perfect sense given the theme and what's going on during a game (you just show up to a crazy building and play the whole thing out with what you brought in and what you can find), but when evaluating the game as a whole against "my most perfectest game int he world ever", that's a bit of a drawback.  But not enough, I'm still giving this monster a 10.

One last thing that bugs me is that, having invested hundreds of dollars in the pre-painted Arkham minis, MOM2 introduces new monsters and new characters.  My collection is no longer complete!  Well, for Arkham it is, at least as complete as it's going to get, but I want pre-painted minis for these new guys!  Sure, I could just learn to paint and paint the in-the-box minis myself, but I'm entirely too lazy.

Still, 10 for sure.  I seriously la-la-love this game.  Don't mean maybe.

4 players. Very thematic, great production values and fun to play. Seemed like it would be a perfect game for 1-2 players however with 4 players there was a lot of downtime and not a great deal to do in between turns as there isn't anything to plan ahead. I respect however that more players allows for more hidden betrayal type aspects as players go insane.

Got to play this game for the first time tonight. It was a lot of fun. Definitely thematic and I love any time an app can create an experience like this one does. The voice acting was superb... wish there was more of it. In many ways this game feels like a one shot RPG, and thats a good thing. The bad? The miniatures. CMON must had me spoiled because these things, while cool, just seemed like the type of thing I'd expect from a lesser publisher. I've seen what FFG can do with miniatures in the most recent rendition of DOOM, so this game's minis feel like the cheap way out. Only other negative was time. This game was long! This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does mean that its going to be the main (if not only) event of the evening. In any case, cool game, hope to play more in the future.

Mansions of Madness: Second Edition is a fully cooperative, app-driven board game of horror and mystery for one to five players that takes place in the same universe as Eldritch Horror and Elder Sign. Let the immersive app guide you through the veiled streets of Innsmouth and the haunted corridors of Arkham's cursed mansions as you search for answers and respite. Eight brave investigators stand ready to confront four scenarios of fear and mystery, collecting weapons, tools, and information, solving complex puzzles, and fighting monsters, insanity, and death. Open the door and step inside these hair-raising Mansions of Madness: Second Edition. It will take more than just survival to conquer the evils terrorizing this town.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Color me impressed. The app really makes this game zoom along and takes care of the DM issue. Quite fun to be able to play together as a group of five against the AI DM as the scenario is programmed. Much less fiddly a game and the puzzles are better worked on the IPad anyway. Games still take a fair bit of time, but the operation is much more streamlined. Now someone needs to do one of these without the horror theme and I'm on board! I expect my Monday night group will work through the scenarios over time although the final 5-6 hour scenario will have to wait for a day time play. Sure comes in a big box!

I'm not sure what to think of app driven games. I noticed that the whole group always starres on the tv screen for at least 80% of play time. I'm not sure I like that when playing board games. Besides that I think it's an interesting experience, the app provides suprises even without a gamemaster. I also like the implemented minigames.
But I do think that replayability is low and that the game is way to expensive for it's contained missions.

Love the look, love the theme, and the components (for my playing needs) are all top notch.  The app adds to the suspense and the atmosphere whilst playing and if FFG can get the bugs out of it then I might change my review score to a 9.5

Shame they released it with app issues that kill the game and have spoiled the enjoyment of it for those early adopters.  With a game like this the first experience should always be the best and I feel sorry for those gamers who lost out by having their app freeze.

For me I'm going to hold off playing the scenarios that currently have the issues on the app and repeat the shorter ones.

EDIT: After playing our second scenario I have pushed my score up to 9.0.  This game has redefined my expectations of board games.

I haven't played the original, so I can't compare to it. This is the first app-assisted game I've played, and my feelings are mixed. On the one hand, the app serving as the game master and doing a lot of the bookkeeping allowed us to get started and get into things pretty quickly. It was very well done and handy.

On the other hand, it almost forced one to wonder why there was still a board element. The app doesn't track everything, but it certainly could, and much of what was happening on the board seemed superfluous. I felt like I was playing a $100 boardgame that assisted a free app, rather than the other way around. That seems odd.

RATING: 7
Initial impressions: Seems so far to have good immersion but not strategically based at all. By that I mean the exploration of the map (which I assume will be a little bit different from game to game even with the same scenario) is fun and you get a good  feel of how a haunted house actually would be like. However, the lack of knowledge of the ramifications of your actions means there isn't much in the way of smart vs. dumb decisions in the game so far.

The app really helps throw a lot of things under the hood and makes this probably accessible to those who can play medium-light games, which is a nice bonus. It also made jumping into your first game a lot easier.

As someone who admittedly doesn't have a strong preference of minis vs. standees with good artwork, I wish they had not had the not very special minis and just had used standees cut out in the shape of the monsters and stats on the side. This is for several reasons: the art on the monster tokens is very good and the minis' bases covers that up, this would have required less first game set up, this would have significantly reduced the cost of the game, the minis since several have similar poses and the sculpts are not excellent quality take a little more than a glance to confirm which one is which, and finally some of the minis won't even go into their bases properly.

Will need to impress me more if I am to consider getting my money's worth (granted, this is the most expensive game I have ever bought), hopefully on the strategic decisions side and having a lot of replayability.

EDIT 1: I know there is strategy in the puzzles, but I meant more long term strategy of e.g. exploring vs. searching, board positioning, etc. I'm seeing some benefits of e.g. staying far apart to limit horror effects vs. being close together to gang up on monsters, but it still feels like more of a pick your poison than you should optimize for this based on if e.g you are more worried about damage vs. horror. Also some item management involved.

I played the 1st scenario again and while I was initially quite excited that the initial map was different, I was disappointed that the scenario played out rather similarly. I think this might end up having the same problem Castle Ravenloft had for me, where while each play is seemingly different with different rooms, they all feel the same because each play is just of gobbled mess of random tiles rather than a narrative (yes is the overaching narrative that you need to beat the game, but the procedures to get there was basically the same).

EDIT 2: Forgot to mention that the flavor text gives you some clues of what actions does what, which is nice; kind of TIME Stories-esque in giving some basis of taking which actions. In fact come to think of it this game feels a lot like TIME Stories to me: besides the clues in the flavor text there is a strong exploration feel, the skill checks testing is kind of mediocre, and you gradually unravel mystery with future game attempts allowing you to ignore certain things that you know probably won't help you. Unfortunately as of right now the smaller amount of deduction makes it not as enjoyable as the Asylum TIME Stories scenario (though better bang for your buck especially since the scenarios still are somewhat replayable, even without the somewhat variable setup). Some people might like this game and not TIME Stories though based on the not as clunky combat and skill checks, more focus on the monsters (even if combat isn't the main focus of this game), there is less of a repetitive feel from playing a scenario over, the aforementioned replayability, you often lose by dying rather than just not being efficient enough with your time, and the app making it feel more like there is a sentient house out to get you rather than static cards.

It might be that each scenario has a different setup based on the heroes chosen, as playing similar heroes got me a similar setup (or might be this just randomly happened). In this sense I might have to take back what I said of my comparison to Castle Ravenloft, and it might actually have the opposite problem that Mice and Mystics also had: once you've played a scenario once there's not a huge reason to play it again however so far played 1st scenario 3 times, 2nd one once, and maybe the later scenarios feel more different game to game.

Despite having roughly the same number of monsters as Mice and Mystics however (which had too few and you were fighting the same mobs basically every other tile), the less focus on monster fighting in this game makes that less of a problem, and the app controlling them makes them perform a little bit differently each round.

Speaking more about the app, the ambient music is nice, along with the occasional narration. The app apparently saves results of when you fail things so that if you barely fail some checks, it makes others easier for you which I also like. Controlling the mythos phase and what flavor text is for what token as I mentioned before makes this game a lot more accessible. I do wish they had provided some detail on how it decides what the party encounters and also how the monsters act, so even if you don't know everything you can still somewhat strategize more. For example, knowing if this monster dishes out more horror or damage so to better choose who deals with it, or if it favors causing the hero to perform certain skill checks over another. I think this game works a lot better with a tablet; passing my phone around is not ideal since it is hard for one person to see it at a time.

EDIT 3: Only have played this with 2 or 3 investigators so far, but seems much easier with 3, as while the monster health scales with number of investigators and there may or may not be slightly more monster spawns, there are still overall less monsters per hero allowing for greater survivability, along with the same amount to search while having more actions to do so.

EDIT 4: I've played all the scenarios, and while the first time for each investigation is great, future plays, even of the last scenario which has different people be the evildoers from scenario from scenario and lets you get into different locked areas depending on what order you explore the own, are rather stale. This is because the overall layout is the same, so while there are new things, 80% of it is a rehash, and while you can choose to ask different questions of the people, since you only have a vague idea of the ramifications of your questions, it doesn't feel as fresh as trying a different strategy/tactic in a different game. I don't know, maybe I should wait a couple months and play it again as I had fun replaying Mice and Mystics again after a little while, but that a lot of the optimization of this game is tied to the hidden knowledge which is no longer a surprise makes me skeptical and I'm kind of tempted to put it on my for trade list already.

While I definitely enjoyed the one versus many aspect of the original, having played with the app, I'm afraid there's no going back. This new edition is completely legitimate, filled with tension, and wonderful interactions.

The app is a utility that I wish I had even in the old version. I would love to have removed so much of the accounting and fiddliness and still play the Overlord, but I will be more than satisfied allowing the game to run itself.

The app makes the theme more involved and intense. The difficulty of the game can be a bit high at times but overall not too bad. Only having two actions per turn is too low but with adding another action per "house rules" it can help overall.

Very good. My first 'app-powered' boardgame. I had (and still have) some reservations about the whole app-powered concept. But the game was very thematic and good fun.

Absolutely fantastic!  The best GMless RPG game I've ever played!  I'm not sure how replayable the scenarios are, so longevity will likely depend on new material being pushed to the accompanying app, and also expansions.

This has a few strikes against it (for me) right off the bat:
-Too long for the amount & type of decisions that need to be made
-Fiddly/clumsy (because of the app)

However, I'm still thinking about it a few days after my first play, which means something about it struck a chord with me and I want to play it again.  It has the right amount of atmosphere to make it compelling to play.  Is this a game I'll want to play on a weekly or even monthly basis?  No way.  I think it's one of those games that is worth a few plays a year at most.  Luckily, the rules seems to be pretty straightforward so it won't be hard to pull it off the shelf occasionally.

The app is an interesting aspect and I feel that there could be something to this game, but it's just not for me based on my experience with it. The puzzles are infuriating, and it's beyond annoying to lose because you can't figure out a logic riddle which to some people might be simple but to me and everyone else was incredibly difficult. I guess I am hardwired to not enjoy anything related to Lovecraft, despite my constant efforts to the contrary.

Z tą grą mam problem; Z jednej strony gra się bardzo przyjemnie, z drugiej strony nie da się nie zauważyć minusów; Po pierwsze gra nie jest jakoś wyjątkowo dynamiczna, a tury potrafią się ciągnąć dosyć długo, nawet wtedy jesteśmy w środku walki z potworami; Po drugie jakość wykonania figurek potworów pozostawia niesamowicie dużo do życzenia, podobnie jak jakość ich podstawek - stwory po prostu z nich wypadają i chyba bez kropelki się nie obejdzie; Dodatkowo na kartach i w aplikacji zdarzają się zwykłe literówki; Po trzecie - logistyka: pudełko nie ma wypraski, więc wszystko trzymamy w nim luzem; Czas rozłożenia, mimo użycia aplikacji wciąż jest długi; Czas rozegrania niektórych scenariuszy także potrafi odstraszyć; No i stół na którym chcemy zagrać musi być na prawdę spory; Po czwarte - regrywalność scenariusza po jego pomyślnym przejściu jest prawdopodobnie mocno ograniczona; W końcu po piąte - użycie aplikacji jest tu obowiązkowe, nie da się grać bez niej, a nikt nam nie zagwarantuje, że za X lat wciąż ta aplikacja będzie dostępna;

Co do plusów: tematyka, klimat i niesamowita immersja - jak w klasycznym RPG; Tą grę się przeżywa, a nie zwyczajnie w nią gra :) Dodatkowo można grać zarówno solo, parami jak i w większym składzie, a gra się bardzo dobrze skaluje;

Mimo wszystko plusy zdecydowanie przeważają nad minusami, więc polecam;

10 lat temu zbierałem planszowy "Arkham Horror (ENG)". W 2013 sprzedałem zestaw i od tamtej pory kolekcjonuję "Eldritch Horror" oraz karciankę "Arkham Horror (PL)". Posiadam również całkiem sporą kolekcję karcianki "Mythos". Od Grudnia 2017 jestem szczęśliwym posidaczem "Posiadłośći Szaleństwa 2ed". Początkowo sceptycznie nastawiony do tej pozycji (aplikacja) ostatecznie po kilku rozgrywkach, patrząc przez pryzmat doświadczeń z w wyżej wymienionymi tytułami, stwierdzam że gra ma jedną fajną cechę: jako jedyna z wymienionych doskonale sprawdza się w rodzinnym gronie. Zakoczyła mnie bardzo pozytywnie pod tym względem.

RATING: 8
Tentative rating after two solo plays of intro scenario.  First play took three hours, second took half that time, but I am not completely sure that I am playing correctly.  The game is fiddly and the rules are not always clear.   For me, it was immersive and thematic, and had some interesting tactical combat.  There was also a very nice sense of discovery and adventure.  The stories so far are generic, but the character backgrounds and details interesting enough to be a lot of fun.  On the downside, there are no interesting decisions to make outside of combat.  From a gameplay perspective, Arkham Horror LCG has far more to offer.  However, the fun adventuring of this game saves it and makes it a great experience, though still not as good as the card game.

Looks fantastic and the app integration is well done, but I do find it detracts too much from strategy, there is very little idea of how your actions influence the outcome and as a result little to no planning except 'explore ASAP and score some items'.

Mansions of Madness 2nd edition is one of the best games I've ever played. FFG has managed to remove almost all the fiddliness from the setup and gameplay and the app handles the role of the Keeper almost perfectly.
Just couple of fixes would make the app perfect; fix the layout of event / combat text to make them easier to read. They should also add a undo button to the app to avoid situations where someone clicked the wrong button (or made any other mistake) and ruined the scenario since it's impossible to start over and skip to the point before the mistake as most of the scenarios are partly randomised.

Don't be intimidated by the price tag, the game is easily worth the money.

The app changes the dynamic of the game and adds well voiced and written RPG elements to this Lovecraftian tale. Plays just as well solo as it does with multiple investigators. My only issues with the game are that the price range seems steep with what you actually get and the miniatures are not up to FFG standards. Even with those issues the game is a gem and playing it without the app seems archaic.

This is a very well made game, but no longer a boardgame. If I wanted to play on an app, there are other... no, I don't enjoy playing games on my Ipad.

I want a boardgame with all the stuff made of cardboard, paper or possibly plastics. I want to fiddle with all the components of the game. I want a transparent game where I can see every card and every rule. I want to analyse it.

Incredible thematic experience! I thoroughly enjoy solo games, so this has been on my list for a long time. First scenario I have lost 3 straight times, but the app keeps everything fresh and randomized so you can't just walk through it, which was a concern of mine going into things. Played Rising Tide with a friend and it was so different from Cycle of Eternity! I'm not sure how the game changes with 3+ players (raised difficulty?) but it's definitely a challenge. 

Played What Lies Within scenario controlling 3 characters and scored my first win! Incredible finish, coming down to a sacrifice of Wilson Richards and a single dice roll to secure the victory.

FUN: the app eliminates a lot of bookkeeping and preparation, so I will be able to play this much more than 1st edition.

UNIQUE: the app creates a unique and thematic experience every time.

NEGATIVES: even though the app makes the game run smoother, it still runs pretty long. During play I also get the nagging sensation that the actual boardgame is not that necessary.

Having played the 2nd edition twice, I like it. Both editions have their advantages, I think. This requires much less preparation, and it´s cool that all maps are explorable and variable. This is also my chance to be an investigator, as I will probably have to be the evil player each time we play 1st edition. You lose some of the flow though, switching between the app and the board.

RATING: 7
Quite interesting concept but way, way more could've been done with the app. Now it feels like the app was created just "because boss said so". Many drawbacks on this game that could've been easily fixed. Figures are pretty much useless, at least for our games - you still gotta check the monster card from both sides, some (especially larger) figures are not having a solid enough bond to the base - by lifting it up you remove it from the base and monsters figures cover up monster card artwork + take a ton of space. Also heavily overpriced, even making pay extra for in-app scenarios even though you need absolutely nothing new for that game - all components are present. Overall: highly overpriced, lots of drawbacks that could've been fixed but still pretty nice game, especially for people that aren't that much into heavier games.

This game is phenomenal. Our first play was a ton of fun, and the game does a great job of feeling like exploration and trying to find certain things more than any other game I've ever played.

This game was great in nearly every way. The App is an awesome improvement, yet doesn't detract from the game. The only way this would be better is if everyone could use their phones to connect to the same game, and do everything from their own device.

Highly recommend this, and I'll likely pick up the expansions as well.

Never has there been a game that I've wanted to love more. It has so many awesome things to it, but they all just seem to culminate into nothing. I enjoy the mystery/investigation aspects of these games more than the fighting and the scenarios always seem to start out awesome in this area but quickly turn into a boring monster grind. If I were Fantasy Flight, I would be thinking of better stories and how to wrap them up better at the end.

This game is amazing because it is very interactive because you just use an application on your phone. You can just pass it around every turn. The insanities drive my friends mad sometimes but thats just half of the fun. The game is very rule intensive but once you do everything correctly you will realize the game is balanced very well. Even after you play a level for the first time you could get wrecked the second time because weapons your start out with change every game and events and people will happen a bit differently. On top of all of that the board gets set up as you go and the game just got an expansion and the app is very easy to use. If you play this game for the first time i would suggest looking online to help you fully understand or read carefully.

RATING: 8
Good: 
Engaging story and theme. The app does a good job of making the board feel like a creepy and slightly off world the players are exploring.  

App helps make exploration engaging and haunted, all the while allowing for quick setup. 

Good selection of characters. Even with just the base game we find someone we would like to play.

For the most part the components are top notch. 

Bad: 
Depending on who you play with the game can be paced on the slow side and may get a little repetitive. 

For most scenarios you only have two actions and are forced to keep moving toward the objective or fail. While this is suppose to prevent players from taking forever to complete the objective the timer feels arbitrary and a little punishing at times. 

Components is a little mixed. The plastic figures and stands are a little on the flimsy side compared to other games. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My friends own this game and I am strongly considering buying it because it is a blast to play.  Definitely my favorite co-op so far.  

Pros:  1) Engaging gameplay (most important aspect of a game!).  2) Challenging but well balanced.  3) Fun storylines that keep me interested.  4) Lots of paths to take and decisions make each play different.  5) Learning the game wasn't that difficult.  6) And most importantly...it's FUN!

Cons:  1) the models ( low quality compared to similarly priced games and don't fit the bases very well at all). and 2) base game only comes with 4 scenarios.  Yes I know each one plays differently each time, but I think they should have more DLC or scenarios right out of the box.  4 is pretty low and for a $100 game I expect more.  

But despite those minor gripes I think this game is excellent!

I never played the original edition of Mansions of Madness so I went into this with zero preconceptions, but to me this is a definitive horror title. The app integration really adds to the atmosphere, coupled with the mechanics and you'll be on the edge of your seat the whole time. The only real downsides are the limited number of scenarios out of the box and the quality of the miniatures could be better.

This games plazes reallz quite different than version one. It lacks the feelihng of playing against a mighty antagonist. It expands more the idea of puzzle solving and leading a investigation. Riddles are easier and monsters are easier to out manoeuvre.

50% videojuego y 50% juego de mesa.

Entiendo el porqué gustan tanto estos juegos. Te cuentan una pequeña historia, el despliegue del juego es muy vistoso y si encima la temática te gusta pues es normal que estos juegos se valoren tan bien. Pero yo busco algo distinto en los juegos que no encuentro en estos. Me gusta que me cuenten una historia pero para eso prefiero un libro o una película. Que un juego sea bonito y espectacular es un punto a favor, pero no lo más importante para mí. Y la temática Lovecraft, aun gustándome, me deja un poco indiferente porque Lovecraft, como escritor, me parece un poco flojo. Yo lo que más valoro en un juego son sus mecánicas, y en MoM son muy simples. Básicamente vas haciendo lo que dice la aplicación y nunca una decisión compleja. Vas moviendo tu personaje explorando la mansión y combatiendo monstruos, pero todo con mecánicas simples y haciendo lo que diga la rubia, esto es, la aplicación. Encima el juego es bastante largo.

En definitiva, no me importa volver a jugarlo y además lo disfrutaré porque aburrirme no me aburrió. El entreturno se hace entretenido porque vas viendo lo que hacen los demás investigadores y los enemigos. Pero hay otros muchos juegos que me gustan más y con los que disfruto más.

I am a great fan of the storytelling and drama of Mansions, and I really like how the 2nd edition is fully coop. Games are usually very fun and memorable. Still, I am beginning to get very frustrated with how little content is included in the base game. It is really shameful how few scenarios are on the app given how expensive this game is. And the devs have some nerve charging extra for DLC scenarios when they give so few with the game.

This isn't my kind of game, but it's an interesting concept nonetheless. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game has become one of my favorite games, especially when looking at games I can play solo.  Story elements are very immersive.  It's very easy to get caught up in the narrative the app plays out.  Puzzles in the app are challenging enough to fit a wide audience, rules are easy to teach (taught the game in about 5-10 minutes with my friends.)  

Can't rate a 10 for 2 reasons. First, miniature quality is subpar for an FFG game.  If I open the Jabba's Palace expansion for Imperial Assault (released around the same time), the models have a lot more detail and are much better molded.  Positioning of models is questionable at best.  The bases for the models are abhorrent, and I will be replacing them.  I don't know what the developers were thinking with the ugly, black bases.  If you aren't replacing bases, I would play with just the monster tokens, which is disappointing to say about a $100 MSRP game.

Second reason is I wish the app did more.  It tracks almost everything, but leaves monster movement and line of sight to the players.  Would be easier to play if the app tracked that, too.  More scenarios would also be fantastic.

A purchase of MoM 2nd Ed will not leave you wanting.  If you see it somewhere, pick it up.

I've only played once, but it was a spectacular experience.  The balance was amazing.  We really had to struggle to win the difficulty 4 (of 5 total) scenario, and we lost one player.  It felt like we were about to lose for the entire final 1/3rd of the game.  This created a remarkable sense of tension that lasted for a very long time.

The app is great.  It does less, and yet more, than I expected.  It makes me want to play with the Descent app ASAP.

I'd rate this higher except for the long play time and fiddly nature of the game.  These aren't knocks, as they are part of the genre and help make it thematic and engrossing, but at the same time, this isn't a game you can just bring out anytime.  There may also be issues with replay value.  I will need to revise my rating after a few more plays.

As goes with the other games of the "Arkham Horror"-franchise the dice rolling has far too much influence on the outcome of your actions. The new element of replacing event cards with an App seems interesting but makes the game confusing to play. I am still not convince that apps are the future of boardgaming experiences simply because events cards and tokens still works efficiently well. 

In my opinion Eldritch Horror is still a superior game than Mansions of Madness because it is more accessible and provides the same experience.

I really liked the first edition.  The Mansion allowed for a great setting and led to some of the most memorable times I've had gaming in the past few years.  However, it was horrible to set up and that drastically limited the enjoyment I got out of it.

The Second Edition gets rid of this problem almost entirely.  From box to getting the game going is on the order of 10 minutes instead of an hour.  Additionally, the app makes the co-op aspect much stronger and makes a 2-player game possible (if somewhat complicated).

The only issues that I have with the game are that it tends to drag on a little bit longer than it should.  If new missions come out that are SHORTER or just consistently exciting then this could be a real winner.

The app is great. I quite like the way it moves the game on. It was super easy to jump in as a newbie. Not my kind of game, but in this genre, this is probably as good as it gets.

Suggest, if I'm in the mood for adventure.

Segunda edición de este ameritrash en el que se juega con tablet, ahora es totalmente cooperativo ya que el máster es la tablet. Para fanáticos del mundo de Lovecraft, jugon, si no eres de ese palo como es mi caso no me disgusta pero prefiero jugar a otros juegos. La estética del juego esta muy cuidada y los componentes son muy buenos.
La verdad es que despues de varias partidas echadas la valoración ha subido mucho porque auqneu son partidas largas, tiene una variabilidada enorme y los componentes son una pasada, bastante inmersivo. Muy buena sensación.

The game is good. Miniatures are terrible, really poor quality and detail (FFG has some good miniatures in SW games, how can these ones be so bad??). Tiles are nowhere as thick as they should for a 100€ game. In general, my feeling is that for 100€ is a bad purchase. For 80€ is a bad purchase.

What would have been fair is to include all the material for the dungeon master in this edition and charge 15€ if you wanted the app to play without dungeon master. The price cannot be justified at all.

Holy shit! So much fun. Having played the first ed. with a new "DM" the experience was OK but with this new app-oriented approach everything is so fast and easy. Easy even for non-gamers! Hook up some audio systems to your tablet/whatnot and the experience will be even better! Highly recommened: only played this new one once but still giving it a 9!  Price is a bit high + not cool having DLC to pay for considering I paid 120€ for this.

Espectacular! FFG nos da una lección de como las tabletas pueden aportar buen valor a los juegos sin que este pierda el factor humano que tanto aporta a los juegos de mesa. 
MofM puede llegar a ser un juego temático perfecto, todo está inmerso en el universo de Lovecraft. Lo he podido jugar varias veces y es superior a la 1era versión, pero igual siento que vuelve a caer en los mismos errores de los otros juegos de esta temática (a excepción de Arkham Horror The Card Game), el nivel de complejidad de las reglas le quita el atmósfera de la premura y el terror. 
Es un juego espectacular para jugadores experimentados, para nuevos puede ser pesado (claramente menos que la 1era versión :) ). 
Pero porque no un 9 o un 10? Porque nuevamente las reglas, las fases, los eventos, y ese tipo de consideraciones restan a la atmósfera, mientras que en otros juegos (Pandemic Reign of Cthulhu) la mecánica va ayudando a ir sintiendo la tensión, en este juego los sucesos o eventos en algún momento carecen de sentido, simplemente sucede porque tenían que suceder en el juego. 
Fuera de eso! Espectacular! :D

Miniatures are really poorly made, the other parts and tiles however, are beautiful. The overall gameplay is beyond great, but the Mythos phase can really got on my nerves towards the end of a scenario.

RATING: 9
I love this game. It looks beautiful, it plays beautiful, it sounds beautiful. For me, it adresses all the issues of the first edition and fixes them (like tedious, long setup times (prone to mistakes), constant rule flipping and random events). The events are still random, but they feel not out of place (an issue I sometimes had with the original). The rules are very easy to learn, in fact we did not read the rulebook, but just started playing. The app asks us for a roll: Look it up in the reference handbook and keep playing (at least if you know the first edition).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Lots of atmosphere - on of the better Lovecraftian games in terms of story. While it lacks the flexibility of the first edition due to no keeper and less variability in scenarios, the ability to play coop and solo is a worthy tradeoff.

Fun and visually rich, especially if you use the app (which is cool) on a TV screen. Game-wise it's "just" thematic dice throwing, but that's ok. 

The price point is LUDICROUS (this goes for the expansions, which are a must, too) and I probably should lower the rating simply because it. I understand that plastic miniatures cost, but there's not even that many of them here & the measly amount of scenarios is just insulting.

I was pretty skeptical of this at first. There are some really lousy miniatures in the box, and the storytelling is a bit hokey in places, but this has become one of my wife and I's favorite games to play together. My rating has been dropping mainly because I'm getting a little burned out on keeping up with the expansions and DLC, especially since Fantasy Flight is charging for every little thing. I find that Mythos Tales covers a lot of the same ground in a more approachable way. And the dice rolling, UGH, the dice rolling. It bothered me at first, then it didn't, and now it makes me question why they didn't make this a full blown app since all you're really doing yourself is rolling dice and moving your character around.

I'm still having fun with this, but for a game that once had real contention of knocking off my favorite game (Arkham Horror), it's not having as much staying power as I once hoped. If nothing else, I figure I can use the minis in my copy of Arkham Horror, so no real loss there.

RATING: 10
One of the guys in our group brought this round (he's got all the stuff from 1st ed too) and as a group we were absolutely blown away by this. I thought the original edition was a sort of lacklustre dungeon crawl with the wrong theme and little for the heroes to do, but with the addition of coop play and the app - about which I was both highly sceptical and wrong - they've brilliantly captured the theme of Lovecraft's writings, and the escape from Innsmouth adventure was just thrilling, especially since I'd recently watched the movie Dagon!
Not sure if it would hold up as well in solo play, and there's little to no replayability in the scenarios, but if FFG keep producing content for it we'll keep playing it, and it'll stay a 10/10 for me.

I never played the first edition of this game and was put off by the warnings around it.  I decided to give this game a try after hearing how the app cleaned everything up and reduced the chances for mistakes.  We really enjoyed the game and found the app to be a great asset to the experience.  My only complaint is that the miniatures are not up to par with some of their current competitors.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
There are almost no interesting decisions and replayability is non-existent once you've played a scenario, so it's just this huge expensive box that sits on my shelf collecting dust. The stories are really basic (get into a house, kill a cultist, leave the house, that kind of stuff) with lame-ass puzzles thrown in at random intervals and cheesy graphics and sound effects. Lovecraft here is just a pretext, which is fine by me since I'm not particularly a fan, but at the very least his writings could have been put to use to flesh out whatever semblance of plot there is in the scenarios presented here.

Also this is not much of a boardgame, much more like an app that's just one tweak away from being fully self-sufficient (you would just have to be able to move the monsters on the app's map). If you like staring at a screen for several hours you might as well play a video game but that's just my opinion.

I have only played solo so it's quite possible that lots of people who enjoy this enjoy the conviviality just as much as the game itself, which quite frankly is not much of a game, more of a choose your own adventure with even less agency on the part of the players. Ask yourself if you have friends who can really contribute to the mood and get past all the cheesiness and limited gameplay before buying.

Slow set-up, but amazing gameplay. Rules seem complex at first but once you start playing and begin using the additional "rules reference" booklet you quickly begin getting within the flow of the game.

A very entertaining experience, but unfortunately cut short during an attack by a mob in turn 14 during the Mythos Phase.
The App broke and there was no way for us to save and exit. The option for this button was disabled.
(We were 3 software developers, who tried to figure out what to do)

Very poor programming and a bad experience, when having fun.

When there's a patch to the game, we might pick it up again, but for now, it's rated a tentative 3.

Have to say, I totally don't get the raving reviews about this edition / game.  Someone gave this a "1" with a comment that I actually completely agree with.

I was very excited to play it, and even had it as a "must buy" on my wishlist going into Gencon.  However, after actually playing a demo and then playing the game, in my opinion this is not a board game.  It is a very passive experience in which there is very little decision making, and in which the physical board and bits simply don't matter.  Don't get me wrong, the app is cool.  It is just that the app is so nice that it made me frustrated with the board game... I'd rather play the thing fully on the computer.  Why roll dice anymore?  Why have figures on a board?  Why have cards in front of you?  Given that the app is already telling you to do this and that and that, I'd rather simply have this be a multi-person online game.

Now, as someone who appreciates story-telling board games, I do feel obligated to explain why this one provides a "passive" experience while other provide a more active experience.  T.I.M.E. Stories, for example, is "passive" in the sense that the entire game involves uncovering a story.  And yet, I found that game to be a really fun, interesting experience.  Partially, that has to do with the dynamic in which players have information that they then need to relay to the rest of the group.  In that sense they become active conduits of information.  Also, use of the card tableau provides a scene that oddly encourages players to actively fill in the gaps.  Mansions of Madness, on the other hand, provides paragraphs of text that merely get read out loud.  You might pass the app around and have different people read it, but it comes down to passive recitation.  In addition, I found that over time, it becomes more like, "Yeah, yeah, just tell me what I need to roll."  You roll, and then the next person recites their paragraph.  They roll, and then the next person recites.  ....

I've basically played every one of Fantasy Flight's Lovecraft titles, and I found this one to be the absolute worst.  Very, very boring.  It's like reading a book, but passing the book around from one person to the next with each reading a paragraph.  Not an unpleasant thing to do around a campfire...but also not a board game.

I really enjoy playing Mansions of Madness with the application. It gives a very immersive feeling to the game. The difficulty of the game is variable and I have not been able to survive some scenarios. The scenario generation is randomized, but still not very variable. In any case, I personally find it really practical not to have to do the set up myself reading a rule-book. It's a lot less error-prone. Although I'm used to play similar games such as Massive Darkness, etc.
You are include characters, tiles and monsters from first edition games and expansions (if you own them). 
On the other side, there are some important descriptions such as "range" that seem to be quite confusing on the rules and there are discussed in many threads. As far as I understand, there's no line of sight. Range is 3, and it does not go through doors or walls (unless specifically stated). Note that it does not matter if doors have been opened or not, there's no such distinction in MoM 2nd Ed. This together with the Evade had us confused for a while ;) Once sorted, we had no other issues with the rules.

One of my most played games lately. 
Can't wait for more scenarios and expansions to release!

The game is hard but fair. The app works great and doesn't take the attention from the board so it's still a board game.

The number of players scale really well and I've played 2-5 players. Haven't tried solo.

The only negative point I have is the Insane cards. You usually acquire them when the game is almost over and there's almost never enough time to complete the objective (except for some).

Looking forward to more plays!

So I don't like this kind of game, normally. But MoM2 is easily explained to newbies, set up in a moderate time and the scenarios don't suffer from bad writing as most other Cthulhu games. I even enjoy the dice in this game since there are a lot of ways to plan ahead and alter the outcome of the roll. 

The App is superbly done. It works as a soundtrack, is very mood enhancing, handles all the stuff that was a pain to handle yourself in the first edition and most importantly: the game is soooooo easy to explain to newbies thanks to the app! You basically just need to explain 4 or 5 basic actions and the rest will be learned on the go.

On the downside it's a pain to get it back in the box, the random and unrelated story snippets (horror checks, fights) are repeating themselves very soon and they are badly written (thousands of adjectives, more funny than tense). 
Also it's a little bit too long.

4 scenarios aren't enough for my liking, too and I refuse to pay money for more when I think I paid enough already. So I am very likely to sell this game soon.

Greatly enjoyed the game.  I love the atmosphere the app adds to the experience.  My only complaint would be the miniatures.  For the price, I expected better.  I had difficulty getting some of them into their stands and a few of them were quite warped out of the bag, especially the Star Spawns which will probably require a hot dip.  Other than that, I absolutely loved it and cannot wait to play again.

EDIT:  After playing some more, I raised my score.  I like the game so much that I am willing to overlooking the minis.   It's just that good.

These RPG-ish games really aren't for me, but I was suckered in by Mansions Of Madness' theme and polish.

MoM does try to get Lovecraft right. Losing a 3 hour game to an otherworldly horror where everyone winds up either crazy or dead, having impotently tried to beat back the monsters and failed, is just how Lovecraft would write it.

And fail you will. Should you replay the scenarios in attempt to win, you'll discover that events repeat exactly, the only change being the randomization of items, reducing replay value to zero. Also, MoM scales for number of players poorly, fluctuating monster health and little else. As most scenarios involve searching for items, attempting with only a few players is very difficult.

The detailed, interlinking map tiles have good, albeit sinister artwork and provide good immersion. The miniatures are well-modeled, but mount poorly on their ridiculously over-sized bases. The other components are your standard Fantasy Flight fare: Many decks of tiny cards, dice, and lots of chits.

MoM:2E suffers from all the issues I have with similar titles, like roll-for-success mechanics, clunky rules, long game set-up and play time, plus it now requires a tablet to play.

MoM:2E's reliance on an app to run the game does allow for all players to actually play, rather than force one to be Keeper, but this spreading hybridization of games with computers is an issue to question. For one, how long will the app be supported? Like VHS games of yesteryear, the technology may one day no longer exist for this edition to even run. Also, as helpful as it is in running the behind the scenes stuff on a detail-heavy game like this, the game could have been entirely done on the app and it feels like they just removed a few features to sell it as a 'board game' instead.

I've always been a fan of the Original Mansions of Madness. The very long setup time of that game prevented it from getting to the table more often then it did. At first I was hesitant to plunk down more more into this series as I have all the expansion and some of the print and play stories. After just a single play I was convinced this was the future of this franchise. With the setup time cut to a mere 10mins this is the version to own. The App works elegantly with the game and provides great ambient sound. I only wish it read even more of the story as it unfolded.

This is a very thematic game and the app driven games master is a big improvement on the 1st Ed. The miniatures are super detailed, and every piece fits within the existing Arkham Horror franchise. 

The app is well built and works well as a book keeping tool. It also means that instead of one player being lost to run the game that the app generates everything and the job of placing and building can be split among all the other players.

The game does have a hidden timer built in and if you take too long the game does bite back and in some cases does not let go. Identifying the timer and trying to eliminating it will not work. This has been thoroughly tested and all those actions wasted will mean it is a lot harder to complete the investigation.

Random elements make this game feel more like a ride than something you can influence and control. The app has sound effects and voice talent BUT it is concentrated in the first few turns of the first scenario and the end game, and is more or less missing from the rest of the scenarios! 

I feel that the app should have more sound effects for monsters and much more varied music, perhaps even procedurally generated sequences to heighten tension.

Played first scenario with four player yesterday - I am ignorant about and don't care for the Cthulu scene at all but I was interested in how the game would work with the app.  Two other players were retired CoC role players who i could tempt back to the mythos without sending them into RPG relapse and the fourth was a (I think) novice gamer who had played Ticket to Ride and Carcassonne but perhaps not much more.  I had studied the rules and got the playing area set up.  Once people arrived we were playing within 5 minutes!  No rules run through, just learnt it all on the fly.

It is terribly elegant.  The rules were - I found - clearly written.

Forget about the app.  It is brilliant and everything but the real strength in the game is the narrative that is built, the interactions between the investigators and the light role playing that goes on.

Our first game took three hours - we explored a lot - but it flew by.  Cannot wait to play again.

Un très gros jeu que ces Demeures de l’épouvante version 2. La nouveauté étant bien évidemment l'implémentation d'une application qui pilote le jeu sous pc/smartphone/tablette.
C'est une très grosse claque que l'on prend direct. Que ce soit en solo ou à plusieurs c'est un vrai régal. Les musiques, les sons, la narration dans l'application sont très bien rendues, une réelle ambiance/atmosphère est palpable pendant le jeu. Le combat ne sont pas répétitif et originaux, notamment par le fait de subir des dégats mentaux qui peuvent rendre fou sans perdre la partie sur le moment.
L'objectif commun des investigateurs (joueurs) est inconnu lorsque l'on démarre un scénario et l'on va pouvoir le découvrir en cours de partir. Il sera annoncé par l'application. Cependant, dès lors où un investigateur aura perdu sa santé mentale, il recevra secrètement une carte folie qui prendra le pas sur son objectif, rendant ainsi les autres investigateurs suspicieux à son égard. La partie s'en retrouve totalement changée.
Les events générées par l'application sont aussi très sympa pour être dans l'ambiance.
L'univers de Cthulhu est superbement retranscrit.
Tout c'est c'est le bon côté... Pour les mauvais je commencerai déjà par évoquer la boite du jeu : il y a plein de figurines qui s'emboitent dans des socles (pas toujours correctement) et aucun rangement n'est prévu dans la boîte! Au prix du jeu c'est vraiment abusé. En parlant de prix, le moindre scénario supplémentaire fera débourser 6€ et les addons pour rejouer à 2 scénarios de la première version des demeures coûtent avec leurs figurines respectives dans les 50€ ... Bémol : les extensions impactent tous les scénarios avec les monstres générés durant la partie
Il y a aussi pas mal de matériel mais à déployer au fur et à mesure de l'avancement de la partie donc ca va mais le jeu n'est tout de même pas simple à sortir quand on part du principe que le scénario d'initiation nous a pris 3h de jeu alors qu'il est annoncé comme étant le plus court par l'application.

The app speeds the game up, but the opacity it provides leads to the game feeling like a string of arbitrary events with players just along for the ride rather than making many meaningful decisions. 

Ultimately it's just an overpriced, overproduced choose-your-own-adventure book...

This is sooooo much fun and absolutely perfect for Halloween. The companion App makes this so good and I will tell you why. First every time you play one of the scenarios it will be different. The board will be randomly generated the clues, puzzles, things you find and maybe even the people you talk to will be randomly generated. The app will predetermine what your starting equipment will be and it will change from game to game. All of this randomization makes the game come alive and really is what was missing from MoM first edition.

I think some of the flavor text and results during skill checks in MoM first edition were very funny and I miss those funny comments in the game. I have fully integrated the first edition components with the new edition using the included Conversion kit and it was very simple.

I never minded set up for MoM 1st edition, but if you did, it's all gone, no set up necessary. I will definitely play MoM first edition again because there are certain people that always love being the Overlord, but I will probably play this new edition the most because now my wife and I can both work together. Well until one of us becomes Insane...and then...at that point all bets are off.

The rules are really simple and streamlined. It makes playing this game a pleasure - easy to pick up, easy to explain etc. All of the failings of the first edition are fixed.

The app is excellent. Really no problem to use at all.

Thematically the game is first rate. Artwork, sounds, gameplay etc. all add to a fine experience. Set up times are great too.

As a solo game, this is probably the best thing in my collection. 

One failing of this game, and is was a problem with version is the minis. Firstly, although some of them are pretty nice to look at, none of them fit on the bases properly, even with glue. Secondly, all of  the info and stats for each creature is in the app, so why have the cardboard chits too? Then, the bases of the creatures are thicker than those of the characters so they look a bit crap together.

My solution is - paint up and use the characters and use the chits instead of the minis. I might paint them later, but found that I am not even using the ones I kept from first ed.

One final thing - although there is quite a bit of playing in the scenarios in the core box, 4 full scenarios isn't very generous ( I paid 100 euro for this game and am only using 8 of the minis). I will pay for more in the future and gladly so, but I would expect and be grateful for free new adventures in the future.

Overall though, this is an awesome game. Now I want apps like this for Descent and Imperial Assault.

Mansions of Madness: Second Edition is a scenario-based dungeon-crawler based in H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos.  While there is some combat, the game puts more of an emphasis on exploration and puzzle-solving.  The game is fully cooperative and moderated by a mobile app, that provides information about board setup and what happens when you interact with various features and monsters.  However, the app doesn't track everything--skill checks are still performed with physical dice, and the app doesn't store information about characters' locations, damage, or items.  This is nice as players can still make informed decisions about dice risk, and you don't have to keep fiddling with the app to keep it abreast of everything that's going on.  However, the app does know some things about what's going on, such as which rooms have been explored and which items have been inspected, and clearly presents challenges based on that--the app obscures why some of the events are happening, which can be a little unusual for a boardgamer.  Personally, I was pleasantly surprised by the gameplay of this game, as I found the mystery to be very intriguing, and interacting with the world to find out what happens definitely kept my interest.

RATING: 6
Alright, where to begin with this one. A lot to like in this and a lot to hate. First off, I'll start off with the hate. The minis are pretty terrible, at least their bases and getting them to stay put are just bad. You HAVE to glue them in otherwise they fall the second you move them. That wouldn't be so bad, but the bases are huge and ugly. Not to mention the minis are pretty poor quality, especially the small figures. Lots of flash and cheaply made.

The game is very luck based as almost everything comes down to a die roll. Yes, you have some thought of what you're going to do in the game, but it's mainly check a search token and roll some dice. Only having 2 actions makes it tough to do anything outside of move and search.

You only have 4 (5?) scenarios in the base game and each expansion that is included after only includes 1 scenario. I'd be more than happy to buy some cheap DLC and just use the tiles/monsters that I have in the game already instead of paying $30-50 for a few extra of each. I'm unsure of how replayable each scenario is once you figure out the "trick" behind it.

The game also focuses heavily on the app. Outside of having monsters and figures on the screen, the rest of the game is literally moot. You're so glued to the app, it's hard to focus on the board. I'd suggest keeping it to one person and having them control the app as a kind of DM. They'll still be invested in the game, but much less so than the other players.

The good things about the game are the awesome story aspects and the completely co-op gameplay. Having a DM before sucked as a tiny mistake here could literally make the game unplayable. Having an app control the situation makes it impossible to fuck up, but you also feel like you have less control over the game. The nice thing though is you don't need to fiddle with cards to attack.

I also like that I can use the monster figures in Arkham Horror to add a bit more suspense to the game.

Overall, a mild disappointment as a game, but a fun story romp that's basically an interactive book. I want to keep getting more of it, but I don't know if it's wise to keep investing so much money into it. I'd like to see how they flesh out new stories.

It was OK. It felt like the worlds most expensive app which would have been better if it were just an app. It was not clear to us whether we won the last time we played the narrative was very unclear.  Well I did not win as I drew a you lose insanity on the penultimate turn so I am inclined to think the others did not win either :)

I hoped this would be the game that made me like ameritrash games, all reviewers were raving about it but man, what a disappointment it was. Throw some dice while I read you a story. And not even a good one! I'd rather read a book honestly.

Also (like with all FFG games) you can expect some wonky rules clogging up the game. 

PD: Production values are kind of crap for such an expensive game.

Really did not expect to like this game as much as I did.  Excellent reprint.  Superb fun.  Creates an exciting, tense and very palpable atmosphere of fun with every turn.  We found ourselves, cheering each other on, high fiving successes and truly engaged in the action.  The app does nothing to take away focus on the game.  It does the opposite.  As my wife put it, it gives you all the fun while taking all the fiddly bookkeping out of the way and doing it for you.  Fantastic game!

Dropping my rating after several plays from a 9 to a 7. This is just hard to get to the table. People don't enjoy the difficulty spike which comes as the game progresses. I think the pacing could be better, and this could be driven by the app fortunately, so it's not a total condemnation or un-fixable. The problem is that the first third of most games is manageable, but as the story unfolds the board suddenly becomes thick with monsters which are incredibly powerful. Only certain characters even stand a chance at fighting so campaigns have a tendency to devolve into a death spiral which is impossible to pull out of. This has led to a lot of "oh it's over, let's just call it" as soon as things start to unravel...and I hate to admit they're usually right. I want to love this game, and I want my friends to love to play it, but as it stands that's become difficult barring some house-rules which might make it more manageable.

Creates great stories that are full of that good Cthulhu flavour and atmosphere. The game is good, fun, and challenging. The app and full coop experience replaced 1.0 for me though I would still like to play some more Call of the Wild scenarios. The app makes things easier, but if you only use one narrator the others might feel left out of the story. Just like the first one, some scenarios are amazing while others are more like window dressing. 

All is well, and it's one of my favourite games. HOWEVER, it's not as initially advertised. FFG said that each scenario is different every time. Which is a big fat lie. Some are static between plays, with minor changes. In other cases, the maps change but not a lot. I was disappointed by this initially. The system still has a lot of potential. Sometimes the story of the scenario is kind of lazy - I could write better and I don't know why they're still holding back. Surely we can make up more original horror stories. The expansions might be able to push the envelope further.

Painted all miniatures from this and the 1.0 + expansions. All I have to do now is get all the expansions from 2.0. The first paid scenarios is also worth it.

The App is still game breaking at v. 1.02 causing me have to start over the 1st scenario  as I was about to win. Also there is not a lot of choices for a player to make. The game makes the choices for you and you just do a lot of random dice rolling for the duration of the game. Really disappointed in the game as is. Crap Minis and when you look at it as a whole, what you get in the box is pretty paltry and definately note worth the high price tag of this game. So far not impressed. I'm shelving my copy until the App is fully patched up and bug free. Shame on Fantasy Flight!!!!

Never played original 1st Edition, but had to get in on 2nd Edition now that there's an app to control the Keeper - meaning that none of the players need to spoil the scenarios for themselves by taking that role, no lengthy/fiddly setup nor risk of errors ruining the entire game, and (hopefully) more replayability due to the "variations" the app can introduce & future downloadable scenarios.

Hoping that FFG release an affordable collection of the figures & tiles we're missing to allow us to use the included "1st Edition Conversion Kit", to increase the variety & replayability of the scenarios in 2nd Edition.

I have played and did once own Mansions of Madness 1st edi. I had played it many times but it was shelved for years before I eventually sold it. I always liked the puzzle aspect to the game and was interested in trying this one out. I love the idea of the APP and how one player doesn't have to try and fumble through the rules of being the bad guy. The app worked surprisingly well and I had a wonderful time playing. We only did the first scenario which alters each time with the app. I am not sure how many variations there are but it was great. I have added to my wishlist and perhaps I will own it sometime. I am happy to play it again when requested.

If there is one thing to critizise ... MORE SCENARIOS PLEASE!!!

In many ways, very similar to Betrayal at House on the Hill. The app integration works well but seems to have less variety than BaHH. Though the Lovecraft universe is fun it is not as diverse as what you find in BaHH. Yhe components are far superior in Mansion of Madness and the app is nice but basically I found the two to be very similar.

The replay-ability is quite low. I had an amazing scenario where the ending ruined it all. We actually couldn't win because we weren't prepared for the big reveal. The big reveal also didn't made any sense based on the clues you were given. So in the end we were really disappointed. The entire story would play mostly the same the second or other run after so it made us sick thinking about spending another 2-3 boring hours to just to reach the point we initially lost the game.

RATING: 6
An interesting, messy, and very thematic survival horror game. It's a pretty fiddly game, with lots of tokens and cards and map tiles. The app helps with organizing all of it (I shudder to think how incredibly fiddly the game would be without it), but it is also an annoying chokepoint for the gameplay. The app is basically the GM, so each time someone wants to take an action someone has to tap something on the app to see what happens / what dice we need to roll / etc. The person running the app needs to be very on-the-ball or the game will drag out quite a bit.

The app does add some tension over a traditional board game, since it might tell you to make a roll and report the results without knowing what your target value is. That makes the game feel a bit less mechanical and more mysterious. It also does a good job of adding variety without making situations where the game just feels fundamentally broken (like Betrayal at House on the Hill does). However, I'm not sure I like it since it starts to feel like the whole game would be better off as a video game instead.

I like the exploration and the general feeling of playing through a pulpy horror novel. I don't like how long the game takes to play through, even with the app. I also don't really like that the game has players play through actual puzzles on the phone/tablet at various points. This really slows down the game and I'd prefer that in-game puzzles rely on the characters' skills, not the players'. The whole thing just feels a bit messy and in need of some clever streamlining that preserves the good parts of the experience and polishes away the lengthy downtime and complicated rules that you need to constantly reference. I think it's likely I'm just not in the target audience for these kinds of games though. People who love them seem to like that they aren't elegantly designed.

I have both Version 1 and Version 2.  I like Version 1 better.  Version 2 with the app is quite cool.  But the rule book for version 2 is much worst than the rule book from Version 1.  And version 1 rule book is quite full of holes.

When the forum has over 400 questions about the rules, you can pretty much know that there are a lot of holes in the rules, meaning things are not explained very well.  And this then leads to frustration which leads to a lack of fun.

The game is fun though and I would suggest either study the rules, faq's, and forums or wing it with what makes the most sense to you.  One will be more enjoyable than the other.

Overall, a fun game.  The app adds a new element that plays nicely.  Plus, not having all the little bits of counters all over is very nice.  8.5  well deserved.

Eldritch was cool and had some cohesive story elements, but I think it is too abstracted at the global level.  Arkham Horror is random nonsense.  Elder Sign is fun, but the lack of a map abstracts it from the theme.  Mansions of Madness is perfect!  The app provides a moody soundtrack and unfolds the story as it goes.  The sense of foreboding mounts as you play.  There is a true story arc here!  LOVE this game!

The app felt clunky and poorly integrated.  It just sort of felt tacked on and cumbersome, not really adding anything to the game play experience that couldn't be achieved with dice/decks.
Played through the scenario "Escape from Innsmouth" with five players, and found the mission itself to be totally unintuitive.  We ran around Innsmouth for a while, never really being threatened by anything as monsters died quickly.  Eventually we started finding clues that led us to escaping on a boat at which point we "lost" for failing to collect enough evidence (despite having interacted with every element of the board except for one location).
All in all it felt like a point and click adventure game meets a clunky app driven board game.

A very thematic adventure horror game. The app integration is well done and does not take away from the experience at all. Fully cooperative, it has always been a fun time when this makes it to the table. The art fits nicely with the mood and tone of everything else and the execution is good. While mechanics will be familiar to those who played the first edition or Eldritch Horror, a new player may struggle a little early on.

The game is quite expensive for what you are getting. Not many scenarios and the miniatures are nice, but not as detailed as other games' are. Add on to that DLC using base game components cost money and are tied to the device bought on and it is a very expensive game. Expansions are overpriced as well and fall victim to the same issues previously described. But ignoring the pricing issues, this is an excellent game that doesn't disappoint.

Owned and then donated away MOM 1e because it was never as fun as you expected it to be. Heard good things about 2e and figured what the hell -- and what a treat to find how automating the DK role to a companion app completely changes the experience!  The game moves so much faster and since the DK role was never as satisfying as the roaming investigators, it also removes the need for one player to feel like the housekeeper.

Have also found this game to be a hit with a more casual crowd (as long as you're OK driving the app).

An improvement over the original in every way. I can't ever go back to playing without the app. Probably the most immersive thematic game I've played. Can't wait to play more scenarios.

Perhaps expensive, the quantity of replayability is nice BUT not because you can choose  a lot of scenrios, just because you can replay the few (four) you have in the core box for fun.

I played my first game of this new edition last night. Five player.

This is an improvement on the first edition of Mansions of Madness. The app aspect works well by adding a bit more mystery, reducing clutter and speeding things up. It also has atmospheric sound effects.

I guess it's the best game in its specific niche. It's better and more developed than Betrayal On House On The Hill, which seems like its main competitor in this genre. 

It's possibly more fun than other 'Lovecraft horror' games of different styles (Eldritch Horror, Elder Sign etc). Although Eldritch Horror is perhaps more satisfyingly 'thinky'. The first edition of A Study In Emerald is still (as of 2017) my favourite Lovecraft game by a mile.

It is difficult to score this game, so I won't. Its 'knockabout' nature makes it a very subjective experience. Despite its current score of 8.4 on this site, many 'sophisticated' players will hate it.

Most of the time players make decisions that are either obvious or blind guesswork. You go into a room, clues appear, you roll dice to 'explore' them, sometimes you take treasure or damage and then sometimes you fight. Rarely the (very chaotic) events manage to create genuinely tricky decisions, but then you might as well flip a coin to decide - after all, you'll be rolling plenty more dice to see what happens next.

The fighting element is much less developed than it is in Descent 2 or Imperial Assault, which look similar but have a lot more fighting and less clue-finding than Mansions of Madness. However Mansions of Mansions is much better than those games at giving players interesting combinations of items etc to work with. Mansions of Madness may have more replayability than them (despite the clue-finding aspect) because in Mansions of Madness a lot more random stuff can happen with item cards you draw, injuries you take etc. So every game will generate quirky new situations.

Overall, if you want to watch little 3cm tall miniatures dice-rolling their way through a hostile building full of fun items and nasty horrors, then go for it. You might love it. I'd play it again.

This was the third time I played this game and first time teaching. I played with Leo, Kay, and Liz. We played the Cycle of Eternity scenario. The scenario was was fun and much better than my first attempt at this scenario. My character went insane and ended up being eliminated from taking too much horror. I wasn't able to accomplish my secret insanity objective anyway (even though Leo was more than willing to help me with it without knowing). We all ended up losing together. A lot of fun, but would like to get a win on this game!

First play was great fun.
What an experience.
Perhaps found a game that has quick setup and can be enjoyed by Lauraine and me.
Happy days.

Replayability could become an issue, but this sounds like a complaint similar to the first game, but without the scenario setup and dungeon master requirements.
Still, a jolly good romp when played, with each scenario quite different.  The final or lengthiest scenario being one of the more story driven too.

Why the rating is so low when this game's like the coolest game ever in bg industry?
This 2nd edition has fixed almost any error in the 1st one and the possibility of infinive scenarios is just too damn big with this app-based game.
I don't find any mistake in this game except the low-replayable value but there'll be more scenarios in the future (I hope)

SO loves this. It's a nice game. I don't enjoy fussing with the app too much though. But it's very easy to navigate.

9 months later-edit: Takes a long time to play so doesn't hit the table much. My SO still loves it. For me there's just not enough of game in the box to justify even half the playtime. Does make for some rememberable stories. Last time we played my SO managed to win, but I ended up an insane paranoid person with obsessive behaviour. So I lost :)

very good game. good contents and very good app. The feeling is really to be an investigator in the Lovecraftian universe, tryin to escape deep horrors. The only bad thing is that every mission can be played 3-4 times then becomes too repetitive. And you know every "secret" of it. Anyway there are lots of expansions and will come too in the app itself.

great components, clever app, full of ambiance, scratched exploration (dungeon crawl) itch, fun to let a little character roleplay decide game actions. i'm sure it solos well. personally, i'm dead tired of both Lovecraft-themes and playing only co-op in my sunday group. everything just ends up so Pandemicy with us facing danger not with tension and a gasp but with confidence and calm logic. "we'll get through this as a team. now, form a chain to push me into the room so i can drop fire in that defensible position." also, the insanity mechanic can be fun, but can also feel a bit like Betrayal at the House on the Hill random crap shoot. i'm glad i've played, but if i never played again i don't think it would leave a hole in my heart.

RATING: 6.5
Pros
• excellent Lovecraftian theme and lots of fun to play. This is my niece's favorite game.
• app allows everyone to participate, taking over most game management tasks
• app greatly improves map exploration enjoyment and increases the element of surprise
• app design is well done, keeping players' attention on the board; but, of course, it's still an app...

Cons  
• The app. This app works very well but mixing electronic devices with board games puts you in a different head space. You have to figure out how to run the app, and deal with how to make it do what you want it to do. Even though this app is well designed, it still takes you out of the game a little bit. 
• My group does not like the app driven puzzles in the game at all. These take us out of the game and brings play to a stop. This is the biggest negative to the use of the app. When we run into one of these puzzles, we groan and then  do whatever it takes to get past the puzzle – we don't try to follow the rules for solving them, we just click through to the solution to get it out of the way. These puzzles do not feel at all thematic, despite what other reviewers have said, and I wish there was a way to disable the puzzles. When a puzzle comes up, it is time for a break while someone, usually me, deals with the puzzle so the game can continue. I can't stress enough what a bad design decision these electronic app puzzles were.
• Fantasy Flight rulebooks are divided into two booklets, which can be a source of frustration at times. I prefer one well organized rulebook, indexed, with gameplay and component illustrations, and explanations of all iconography. 
• Sometimes the app refers to items and monsters for which there are no corresponding components provided. We have all of the expansions, so that's not the problem. I think there is something that I'm not understanding, so this is probably my fault.
• Long play time; we have not found the listed scenario play time durations to be accurate. However, our group seems to be slow because this is a problem we have with many games. Another group may not have this problem. I've found that the person running the app needs to keep the group focused in order to move the story forward; the app isn't intelligent and can't substitute for a good game master in this regard. 
• After a time, the descriptions provided by the app become repetitive. 
• App detracts from game if device is passed around; best to assign one person to run the app; the app should be thought of as a game master assistant, allowing the game master to participate in the adventure. 
• The game is best when a scenario is played for first time. Consequently, new scenarios will be needed to get the most value from the game, which means there is a dependency on app development and maintenance support. Once that stops, the game will be disposable. This is a fundamental problem of games requiring software application support: the game is no longer self-contained; hence, there is an element of built-in obsolescence. Will this game still be playable in 10 or 20 years? Probably not. I have games in my collection that are 50 years old and still played. This is not going to be true for Mansion of Madness, 2nd Ed, but that doesn't mean the game is not a good value now.
• I'm not a fan of the monster minis. The minis add cost and take up storage space. We only use the monster tiles. This, of course, is just personal preference like most of the cons I've listed here.

RATING: 9
SO MUCH FUN!!!!  Wasn't sure what would happen next, very thematic, totally absorbing.  The main drawback though is that the play length is REALLY LONG for us.

Replay value is kinda iffy with just the base game.  From what I have seen (I started playing the same senario about 2 times before official game) there is not a whole lot of variety between plays.  Same stuff, same monsters, roughly the same places.  Rooms might change sides and the random rewards might be different but everything else is mostly the same.  In order to improve replay, you need to get more expansions for the app to pull items, monsters, and rooms from.

[b]Update:[/b] The expansions give the game app more choices when setting up tiles and such for each scenario.  Most of the key items of interest will still be there but some of the room layouts will change.

RATING: 8.5
A huge improvement over the first ed, this is THE best game for those looking for a story-based "dungeon" crawl a la Betrayal at House on the Hill. Good mix of exploration, fighting monsters, solving puzzles, the app does a brilliant job at removing the need for a GM/overlord and controlling the "randomness" factor in story-based games by still making each play through of the same story somewhat variable but not placing you at the mercy of the random shuffle of a deck like BaHotH. I really like the test rolls where you don't know what the outcome will be - it's not simply succeed/fail, instead you might get 2 success rolls and receive a reward, but you don't know if 3 or 4 success rolls would have given a better reward. There are still some issues - since only one player can use the app at a time, even when they're reading out loud there can be some down time. Set-up is much faster than 1st ed, but the game still takes a very long time for a not-very-deep coop, and while you can save, clean-up, and continue another night, this is not ideal.  While I prefer sitting down at a table with friends over playing online games, this game is probably the perfect choice to be implemented on the digital tapletop device that's like a big iPad and dump the physical components, no sorting through tiles and minis to find the right one, track character location and status so horror checks and effects are automatic, etc.  Hard to say if it's worth the price though - I personally wouldn't buy it, but am happy to play a friend's copy.

Wow. What a cool experience this game is. Especially if you can play the app on a TV through steam. I was engaged and excited the entire time. There are an awful lot of clicks or taps throughout, and it almost feels more like a video game than a board game at times, but it's really the experience as a whole that makes this worth it. It may have even gotten higher points if it weren't for the dreadful minis. They don't attach to their bases and they're just cumbersome and kind of superfluous. The bases are all but pointless, other than distinguishing between like models. All in all it's a great game and one I would highly recommend anyone play.

Betrayal at House on the Hill is probably my favorite board game, its the game that got me into board gaming as a hobby. That said, Mansions of Madness 2nd Edition is like the next logical evolution of Betrayal. It takes the "randomly made story" of Betrayal and turns it into this cohesive experience that feels almost closer to a video game than a board game. Its easy to teach because the app does most of the hard work, and its engaging the whole way through. I guess my only gripe is if you fail a story, you may have a hard time convincing your friends to replay that same story over. Luckily the game has plenty of stories and even DLC in the app to keep the game fresh, if they don't want to replay an old one, play a brand new one! 

I have painted all my miniatures from this game.

This is a game that plays you.  Rolling dice for random results is not fun.  The decisions are not interesting.  Move, explore, interact, fight... very boring.

Utterly bleh...

The game was almost abandoned when we were part way through the multi screen introduction, I just don't get why throwing wall after wall of text at the players makes a game immersive.

When we finally got to the game, a murder mystery, it was OK and we solved the case, which was satisfying, but then the game lurched from an investigation puzzle to a minis based combat game that was terribly dull with no meaningful decisions to be made, just throw dice until either party is dead. No more for me.

I'm willing to overlook the okay-quality minis and their horrible bases that they don't fit into. Nothing a little glue can't fix.

This game is INCREDIBLE. So thematically engrossing and so much fun. I'm not sure I like it more than Descent 2nd Edition, my 3rd all-time favourite game, but I will say this: Mansions wins big time when it comes to providing a sense of exploration, and that is very important to me in board games.

As for the app integration, it's absolutely seamless. I love what it does. I held off on buying this game for a year because I wasn't sure I'd like it. I was so wrong. It greatly reduces set-up time and takes care of upkeep and mythos events, etc, leaving the players free to just play and enjoy themselves.

Rating after 2 games, playing first scenario twice. The game is good and the atmosphere is thick. However, the minis are absolutely awful, ruining the first impression and there doesn't seem to be enough variety to warrant repeated playthroughs of the same scenario. EDIT: Lowered from 7 to 6 after another play, this time scenario 2. The app severely limits how the enemies behave and not in a good way. The mob enemy in scenario 2 is comically scripted to the point where you can chase them around rather than the opposite. The app quickly becomes annoying, unless you have a device with a large display (I used my 9 inch Kindle Fire HD which is the biggest portable device I have) you can barely see what's on the screen, they should have really invested in the lector for all the lines. And then there's bugs. Oh, how I missed the bugs from video gaming. Yesterday our Horror check read: WATER_SPLASH_02. That's it. This game combines the worst of both worlds, the fiddliness and simplistic enemy AI of board games and the neverending production cycle and rushed nature of modern video games. I won't be buying any more board games requiring and app and I won't be buying FFG games without doing a massive research on the component quality, which is a real shame.

Mansions of Madness was good, but flawed. This second installment is an excellent remake and fixes alot of the bugs and issues I had with the first edition. The fact that its now fully coop makes it more thematic with less monsters jumping back and forth into rooms to scare investigators to death..

While the app at times can make you wonder why you even need the board, dice and cards I still find it super fun to be able to play a story-focused board game without having to have a specific player taking on the role of the enemies and storyteller. My only real complaint about the otherwise fantastic components is the miniatures do not come attached to their bases and can be a pain in the butt to attach (due to both inconsistent peg sizes and general plastic warping) and gluing them all makes them impossible to store back in the box (when you have all the expansions...)

My rating is based on me, not on the game as such. I'm not as big into this kind of game as my gaming buddy whom I played it with, but it's absolutely a great game of that kind. The app means the game moves smoothly, not many fiddly cards and such to worry about, you just play the game. We had fun playing the first scenario (even though we died terribly, killed by a ravenous mob) and I'd be happy to play it again, I just would never say "Hey, let's play Mansions!"

Pros - Quick set up and tear down, full co-op experience, good story parts,App is good for book keeping.
Cons - Limited scenarios and variability for replay, AI Keeper can't compare with a human one in terms of sheer malice and thinking outside the box. App needs an undo option for when mistakes are made.

A good co-op, but a pale shadow of the excellent all vs 1 experience of first ed. Also a decent tile/monster/item expansion to first ed if you create your own scenarios.

A definitive improvement from the first version. The app helps with the script and atmosphere. Sadly, as great as the game is when the scenario starts - with tension, mystery and dread - as soon as the monsters start showing up, the games descends into the dice rolling festival that so many ameritrash end up being. Roll to attack with every character, then monsters move and attack, everyone rolls to defend, then horror rolls for every character after a mythos roll to test skills - rinse, repeat. Dead monsters, more monsters, more fights. Fatigue comes in, then boredom, then we stop even reading the flavor text for the rolls, then we stop rolling. Sigh. Still the game to put back in the box. 
Dust gathers.

I enjoy the pure cooperative nature of the Second Edition more than the One vs. Many of the First Edition.

RATING: 7.6
Incredibly immersive. People really aren't kidding when they say that the app really sets the mood for the game. It also handles all the bookkeeping and allows the players to all get into the game itself. Really easy to learn too.

Three negatives. One - There is no feedback from the app when a monster is defeated and it's a bit of a downer. The battles with monsters are epic and have severe consequences. So when you defeat one, you sort of expect a monster's dying scream or at the very least a message that says "Monster Defeated" but there isn't anything. Two - In typical Fantasy Flight fashion, the box insert is absolute garbage, but that's almost to be expected. It just sucks because there are so many miniatures that need to be stacked on top of each other. Three - Not enough campaigns for the price. It's still worth it to me, just because I love games like this, but it's borderline.

I know it seems like a small thing, but honestly, if the monster defeat thing was added, this game would be a 10 for me.

I have mixed feelings about this.  It solves the two biggest problems with first edition: long set up time, combined with the fact that a tiny and easily made mistake could break the game.

I'm fine with one against many and co-op games so that is a wash.

The down side is that so much has been shifted to the app, that it feels as much like a video game as a board game.  Also a great deal of the mechanics are buried in the app, which makes it feel a bit passive and gives it a bit of a feel of just bumbling along to see what happens.

In general, it makes it much more of a lighter game experience, but a much simpler and easier game.  Turns it into a gateway ameritrash storyteller more or less.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Never played the first game, but have enjoyed playing through the first scenario with the missus twice (we still haven't won it...).

We've been playing without the miniatures (just using the slot in cards) as the bases seem way too large to fit on the board with all the other tokens/cards on there – which makes the £90 price tag a bit high if we end up never using them.

No problems with the app so far, but from other reviews I think the biggest issue seems to be with the second scenario. Hopefully that will be rectified by the time we get there.

We're having a 4 player game this coming weekend, so will be interesting to see how that compares to a 2 player game.

Overall a very good game, a bit expensive and I'm still not sold on bothering with the minis.

RATING: 7
I had a lot of fun with this, but I think it has two problems.  Many of your turns you will spend doing nothing but moving, and that is uninteresting.  With 5 players it can be boredom inducing.

The other main issue for me is that it claims to be fully cooperative, but it isn't.  You can 'win' by leaving everyone else behind, but there are no mechanics to cover it.  How does it follow that you can lose sanity and cause yourself mental problems throughout the game, but leaving everyone you were with to die for no reason is totally fine?  You even apparently have a psychic link with these people, given the game's mechanics.  It's not a problem when they die horrifically?  I think the semi-cooperative aspects could have been thought through better. 

Still, the app is great, and the one story we played through was involving enough with some nice little surprises.  I'm happy to play more, but I wouldn't be surprised if the problems grate on me.

RATING: 5
First things first, this is an experience game, and it has very little replay value, even with new groups where a single player has played before. The app provides a very slick interface and makes the game run smoothly, providing you don't encounter any bugs (unlikely).

For your $120 CDN, you get a massive box which is half-filled with air and components you can only use if you owned the First Edition of this game. That's right, every monster tile that doesn't slide into a base (I say slide as if you didn't have to force them in) is for a game you probably don't own. The game also comes with replacement character cards for First Edition as well.

What you _will_ use are the giant, beautiful room tiles, 32 plastic figures of fairly shoddy quality, stands for those figures, monster tiles, and a ton of tokens. There are also some decks of cards on extremely good-quality stock.

The plastic monster stands just baffle me. The figures are not great, and you will probably need boiling water to fix one of the Star Spawn figures to fit in the base. The stands obscure the art on the tiles and expose only those bits of information you need. But the illustrations are scarier than the figures! This game could cost a good deal less if they'd just let you use the monster tiles without plastic. And since the tiles barely fit in the stands (the smallest ones, that is), I can't even get them back out without ruining them!

The game itself is fun, but has next to no replay value. You get four (FOUR!) scenarios with the app, and have to pay $5 or so for a fifth scenario. Buying a $40 expansion will get you two more scenarios, and each $60+ expansion gets you one (ONE!) more scenario. The value proposition on this game is terrible.

If FFG would continue pumping out IAP scenarios for this game like they did once before, I would say go for it, but they haven't done that yet.

UPDATE: Some of the Insanity cards are complete bullshit. You could be four hours into a scenario and Rita Young goes insane (she only has 5 Sanity and there may randomly be no way to cure her) and gets a card that sinks your entire "investigation". No fucking thanks. We removed the 3+ Insanity cards.

It was definitely a good decision to have an app run the game. It removed a lot of the frustration that the original game had when letting a friend gm, which helps you stay in the story and ambiance of the gameplay environment.
The maps, running around avoiding enemies while trying to solve the puzzle, and the narrative of your actions are all great fun.

It's just OK - the app holds you by the hand and the game becomes a plod-a-long.  Setup was a breeze, however. 

The last thing I want to do is have my face glued to a computer screen (like at work all day, and I honestly felt that we were playing more of a video game than a board game), so I admit being biased against the app.

The game is thematic yes, but it takes too long to play for what it is.

On the whole, this is an excellent way to spend an evening.

Is it a game though? I'm not sure, The storytelling is excellent, the theme is great and for me (because I paint and rebase the miniatures) it's part of my hobby. It feels more like watching a film than playing a game on occasion - the stories it tells are really good, but there's not a whole lot of meaningful decisions to make. I feel often that I'm just along for the ride.

But it's a fun ride, so who cares?

The first edition was a bit 'meh'. Lots of downtime when the DM had to look up rules, simple deduction mechanics and just not fun enough.

The second edition rework of the DM into an app makes this game a physical horror-themed adventure computer game.

Which is great, as it brings the relaxing boardgame environment and the horror-themed anxiety together, for a shared angst-experience. 

Game on my radar again!

Played once solo.  At first, this game had me very impressed.  I loved what the app did for the game.  But, half way through the game, my phone decided it wanted to die (low battery).  So, I had to wait while it charged.  Considering it was fully charged when I started, this doesn't look like I should use my phone :\  I may have to use my laptop next time.

Also, by the end of the game, I felt like there was just too much dice rolling.  Though, I'll admit, I'm not much of a "play solo" kind of person.  I feel this game will improve for me when playing WITH other people.

I like the narration in the app, though I wonder if it would make it even better if the entire app was narrated (except for the actual mechanics, such as what checks to make).

7/13/17: Played with two others.  The game was really fun with a group...but, it is a long game.  It is important that everyone stay focused and patient so everyone can see what is happening.  Both players I played with said it is now one of their favorite games.

A disadvantage of the game: Every scenario is for one game, because the story will be every time the same and in this game the story is everything. I think it wouldn`t be interesting to play the same story, with different locations, or characters and so on.

This is kind of like an RPG, but an app plays the DM.  As a long time D&D player and a big fan of co-ops, I was immediately drawn to this concept.

The app is very well done, providing variable scenario setups, great flavor text, and theme music.  One thing that I really like is that it often throws skill tests at you, but doesn't tell you how many successes you need.  But, you still need to decide how many resources you want to use to maximize your successes.  There are a lot of characters an a lot of items that make the game replayable.  

I also really love how they did the spells.  When you gain the ability to cast a spell, you basically take a deck of 5 (or 4?) copies of the spell card.  On the back of each card, there is a different side effect that triggers when you cast it.  So, you never know exactly what is going to happen when you cast a spell.  I just really love the flavor of that.

Very gdisappointed I'd. I couldn't quite grasp it at first. You only get 4 scenarios in the base game. All the rest of the 10 need the expansions. At first glance that seems poor value for money. But after the initial easy trial game, the others are hard. But you realise that when you play the same scenario again, that although the intro and quest are the same, everything else after differs. Different map layout, different clues, and potentially completely different game. One game I had involved talking to characters the discern the cultists. We lost, so tried again and now the same scenario was now 100% fights. So there is actually more value for money. Everyone knows that vanilla Arkham is actually too easy once you figure it out. And with MoM each quest is relatively harder and will need multiple attempts, giving a real sense as f achievement once you've finally won it. Each scenario is rated which is nice so you can scale if playing with family or gamers etc.

FFG took all the best things from the first edition and packed it into this box. Also this game shows how an accompanying app should look like - atmospheric music, unpredictable enemies and unexpected events plus the main thing - very nicely done exploring and setup time reduced to a bare minimum for a larger game like this. If you liked the previous edition you will love this one! And what's the best from FFG - if you own the previous edition there is a conversion pack included so you can use all your miniatures and floor tiles from the previous edition. That's how companies should threat their long-time loyal customers!

The Second Edition actually fixes a lot of my issues with the Mansions of Madness system (especially set-up), and the app is pretty slick but, for some reason, I think I still prefer the original.  I like that the Keeper gets to make story choices at the beginning that will determine how the story will play out.  Second Edition has variety with room placement and whatnot, but each scenario will always end up telling the same basic story each time.  Seems like it would have a little less replay value.

I've been waiting for a good game to come along and integrate an app properly, and this game seems to have finally done it.

To me it actually feels a lot like TIME Stories (TS), but the app handles all of the fiddly parts and puzzles. In fact I don't see a real need to play any more TS as long as they keep making new scenarios for this game.

At the basic level, MoM and TS both have an overarching story and you have to travel around and interact with different parts of the game in order to progress. MoM is less of a chore to play because the app handles a lot of the bad parts of TS. You don't have to dig through a deck of cards and put out certain ones in order to travel, you just click the screen in MoM. In TS you really had to take notes to play effectively, but MoM keeps track of everything automatically on the app. The puzzles also work better in MoM because you just slide things around on the screen.

I also feel like MoM could mostly replace Eldritch/Arkham Horror, which is too bad for me because I own almost everything for Eldritch. The main difference being that Eldritch has you travelling around the world and MoM has you exploring usually a single location, so the scope of the games feels different even the gameplay is very similar.

My only real complaint with MoM so far is with the miniatures and their bases. The bases themselves are these ugly, needlessly large, black plastic masses. The minis just have one little part that attaches into the base, so they don't stay in permanently. If anything ever touches it then the mini just pops out of the base and you have to fight to get it back into place. It will be almost essential to glue them into place.

Overall, a really good experience and a well done app.

Rating could go up or down after playing more scenarios.

A fantastic re-implementation. It's amazing to see how thoroughly they've really taken all the kinks out of the first game. They've virtually eliminated the painful setup step, added some replay value to the scenarios, and even gotten down to more granular mechanics, making spells less OP. A must-have for fans of the original, and highly recommended for any board game fan!

I think the game deserves praise for the theme and app integration, which I think are pretty excellent. The game itself, however, is kind of dull. Dice roll, dice roll, dice roll, dice roll... I once fancied myself a bit of an Ameri-trash fan, but I look at a game like this, where you need certain items / spells to mitigate negative outcomes without any recourse of acquiring them without complete dumb luck, and I'm really put off by how mechanically substandard this game is. I mean, it is in the same vein as, say, Eldritch Horror and Elder Sign (both of which I like), but in those games, you know where to go to acquire certain types of items. MoM is a complete crapshoot. You might get something to remove horror or you might eat a ton of it and go insane (or lose the game entirely) without having any real control over the outcome. There aren't any difficult decisions to make here; the game feels largely on rails.

Meeeeh... what a game. I thought I would enjoy it a lot more than I did, but it disappointed me a lot. First the sessions feel neverending, and they keep getting longer and longer!! Second the app lacks BASIC functions such as "back", for when someone accidentally presses forward when they shouldn't (and believe me when a large group plays it happens a lot). Also, and this is a personal point of view, it seems like a tablet game half made on physical form... and I really don't like that (maybe others will, I don't). The physical components felt limited... lack of diversity in the monster's pool and the box was mostly empty, which for a big box like this is a bit puzzling.
And finally, another personal sensation, I didn't get into the game, even if it tried very hard to create an ambiance.
Oh and don't get me started on the fact that there is 4 adventures on a 80 euros game. FOUR. And the expansions are really expensive for ONE extra adventure. Or maybe two, I don't know, but it is outrageous.

RATING: 7
It's a fine game, more of that similar feeling FFG Arkham stuff.  Cthulhu monsters, picking up spells and weapons, going insane, passing skill check rolls and moving around a map. 

This one is supposed to feel more thematic I guess, but I really didn't feel it so much, the app could definitely use more voice over work and maybe some more mood setting.

The stories are also pretty thin, maybe adding a little more story or mystery would draw me in more.

Either way it's a decent enough game and entertaining, I just wish there was some more immersion.

The minis are pretty awfully designed.

I got a chance to play this a week ago at the Fantasy Flight Game Center, and I really enjoyed this game. We played twice and we barely lost once and barely won the other time. I like how we played the same game twice, but with the app, the game was different. The story aspect is really good as well in the game, and with the puzzles in the app, it makes it a different immersive experience. I'd love to play the game with sound on, but obviously would be an issue to play audio in a game shop.

First of all I am not against apps in board games. I loved the way Alchemists used the app, and looking forward on how 	
First Martians: Adventures on the Red Planet and Rising 5 will use it.

However, the problem with MoM's design, is that there is no real need for a physical component. The app could have handled the character movement, the rolls, the conditions.

It feels odd and fiddly to select the monster that I want to attack on the app, choose how I attack it on the app, roll the physical dice, and input the result on the app? Why? Physically rolling the dice, and physically moving the plastic dolls around the map dose nothing for the gameplay, on the contrary it just creates disconnection, as you keep switching context.

Anyway, if you are running a Cthulhu RPG, than yes, the package is worth the money: you get some nice tiles and some nice plastic dolls, and as a bonus you get a decent board game, however if you are a board gamer, why on earth would you spend 100$ on a glorified app? 

In the end there are some things that video games(and maybe rpgs) will always do better(theme, immersion), while board are better when it comes to creating interesting situations with tough choices. I think designers should understand that, and play to the boardgame's strength, rather than trying to do everything.

Not for me and my group.
From a gameplay prospective the satisfaction we get playing it was reaaaally on the downside.
It's just a "point and click" adventure. Go there, throw dice, read things. There is not much really good and hard choices to make.
We find also a bit repetitive the combat system and the skills checks, after a bit it all comes down to read the same-ish paragraphs and throw a couple dice.
We got bored.
Should all comes down to plot twist and emotional stories then, but even here, none of the base scenarios break into us hearts. So...

RATING: 9.5
I loved the first edition of MoM but it had one little problem. Since it was my game and I was most familiar with the rules, I was always the keeper. I didn't mind being the keeper but the idea of being an investigator was more to my liking. MoM 2e fixed this by making an app act as the keeper, allowing me to finally play the game as well. 

I've played all the scenarios multiple times with player counts ranging from 1 to 5 and it's fun at all of those. I hope FFG keeps releasing new scenarios and new expansions - they most likely will - for a long time. 

This, more than Eldritch Horror, is probably the game that will knock Arkham Horror down for me. The only problem I have with the game is the miniatures and their bases. The bases block the art of the tiles and the miniatures refuse to stay on their bases. I ended up putting the miniatures in a box and I play with just the cardboard tokens for the monsters. This way, I can keep everything I need to play the game in one box and actually take it to game nights.

About [thing=205059][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=205059][/thing] is the follow-up to [thing=83330][/thing], and it remains a game of horror, mystery and investigation in a very personal and small frame: usually a mansion or a manor. But it has two major changes: it is fully cooperative (well, at least for the majority of the time) and is app-driven.

The full cooperative and app-driven changes made possible for [thing=205059][/thing] be a good option for solo play, while in the first edition, this would only work in a few scenarios - none in the base game.

And it also made possible for the game to retain the mystery aspect of uncovering clues and unfold an investigation without the need of getting everything ready and in the proper place ahead of the time, and took out the drama of one mistake making the whole play impossible to finish, which is a major bummer when we are talking about a 2-5 hours game. This all means the game comes with a lot less cards (no more Keeper cards nor combat), and the set up is basically sorting some decks and tokens, picking investigators and scenario and went for it: a 10-15 minutes affair instead of the brutal time the first edition had.

Replay value seems higher, as the app can generate different configurations for the same mystery. 

The 2ed kept, however, the quality in art and miniatures, and the box is even bigger than before - most in the count of the Star Spawn miniatures.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Much like in the 1st edition. Players will try to solve a mystery by going to a dreadful place. Every person has two actions, and the main actions possible by the investigators are:
- move up to 2 spots;
- search;
- fight;
- take items;
- trade.

Depending on the action done the app will call for some test. Dice are rolled and they are all d8, with some sides being success (elder sign), possible success (clues) and failure (blank). Player can turn the possible success into full success by spending clues, on a 1 to 1 ratio.

As before, the spells are double-sided, and once used, they can have some unexpected effects. Damage is handled different now: there are, still, Stamina and Sanity, but when either is damaged, players take cards: some will go facedown (just marking damage as if counters) and others face up, having constant ill effects. Is possible that, during the play, sometimes the app will call for the player to turn over one of her damage cards - the effect on the other side will be applied then. This is highly thematic, as old wounds open and come back to hinder again, and passsed traumas surface to make the person relive traumatic experiences.

If an investigators gets insane, the player takes one insanity card, which might add or change the way that investigator will win the scenario, usually giving the investigator something to do, even to the point of becoming a traitor.

Once everyone has had their turn, the Mythos phase come in. Monster will move and attack, if they can, some random or scenario-based events will take place, sanity will be rolled for those facing creatures, and so on.

Then is back to the investigators. Play will continue until the mystery is solved inside the time available, or until things end up in failure.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Which action to do. Normally the state of the game will show what is more pressing. Some guesswork might be necessary in order to find the evidences, or spots to be, or what the investigators truly need to do in order to win. But the scenario will provide clues in order to lead the investigators to the objective.

Normally the decisions will be group-based: "I do this, you do that, she goes there" and so on. Positioning and proper teamwork will be keys to win, regardless of the scenario.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Great production value, from art, to components and graphics;
- Strong thematic experience;
- Due to the unknown results of many actions, an alpha player won't have an easy time here;
- Set up and tear down aren't big issues, specially considering the "size" of the game;
- Downtime is less of an issue as it was in 1st edition (specially when considering combat and the Keeper phases);
- No more "I will always be the Keeper" thing.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Is app-driven (hey, is my opinion and I don't like app in my analogic games);
- Replay value, while much less of an issue than before, is, still, an issue;
- Less fearful for the investigators than its predecessor.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Begrudgingly. I'm not a fan of apps in games. The less they do the more I like. Still, after going with my cane towards the ipad to say for it get out of my lawn, I must admit that the game was enjoyable and I wasn't as bothered as I thought I would. For a game that part A must happen before B and this one before C, otherwise things won't work, a computer program will take care of it better than humans in a hurry of playing already. An app was a good decision - it could be handled some other way? Probably, but the digital do allow for a type of freedom to add and change that the analog simply doesn't.

Now, does the second edition has a weaker parts when compared with the 1st? Yes, a few. The presence of a Keeper means the actions done to the investigators tend to be more focused, as in the 2ed, since the app doesn't take into the consideration the place the investigators are nor which actions was done by who, it means that the occasional event targeting someone happens by chance.

Also, a Keeper brings more tension to the game: the actions of the investigators tend to be done with one eye on the board and the other on the Keeper. "Will let me move freely? Will he use one of her cards now? What devilry is she planning?", and so on. As the AI is only activated when "touched", several actions are "safe" - in most, almost all cooperatives, this isn't an issue, but when you get in a terrible place, in a personal level, one would expect a constant feeling of tension and fear, and in MoM 2ed, this simpy isn't there.

Still, in the end, the 2ed improved the gameplay and easiness to get into the meat of the play. It isn't without flaws nor weak points when compared to the 1st ed, but when considered which one people will be playing more often and won't be scared of actually playing (mainly the Keeper), the 2ed is the clear winner.

Circumstances surrounding this game are complicated. However, I will rate it as soon as we have one game in.

Played the first mission twice yesterday and found it tough but a tremendous amount of fun with two players. The puzzles really added to the enjoyment. 

A big negative is that the miniatures are awful and many fail to fit into the stands. The stands themselves don't look particularly good either, but aside from that it's a nice looking game that isn't too difficult to play and our second attempt at the first mission was a rapid affair of taking actions and reacting to events in the mythos phase. 

The random mythos effects and horror checks a little bit fiddly and annoying, but that's part of most cooperative games. It doesn't outweigh the fun of exploration, combat and puzzle solving in the game. I've tried a few more missions and novelty is beginning to fade. The quality control on the missions seems hit and miss.

Compared to descent road to legend, this is much more fun.

A little unsure about replayability, having a full-featured mission editor with user-defined content would be very handy.

I like dungeoncrawls as much as the next guy, but was still disappointed with Mansions. The second edition is certainly an improvement over the first, but for one I am not sold on the integration of the app. Especially if one player has to read the on-screen texts out loud, because the tablet is too small for everyone to read them. The downtime that this creates adds to the downtime of each fellow adventurer going through their turn (debating their actions with the rest of the players) and the Mythos phase, which is longer that the turn of an average player. And then there is the randomness of the event cards, which may cripple you before you can finally take your next turn, with no way to prepare for its effects. It is still an atmospheric setting, 
and I like the Cthulhu universe, but this game just did not grab me as much as I hoped. Maybe I should try it again with just two players.

My group played this once and it completely fell flat. My buddy put it up for sale the next day. I'll avoid this in the future.

I'm more into realistic themes than fantasy to begin with, so this game already had that going against it, but this one was incredibly boring for me. The decisions were not deep enough and there wasn't enough variety for me.

In terms of crawl around a map games, I much prefer Imperial Assault to this because of the theme, or Arcadia Quest. I can see how this game would be enjoyable for a family that liked non-competitive dungeon crawls though.

I love the app and it handles getting this game going really well. 

There are a metric crap ton of pieces, which is great and lends the fact that you're never going to play ever scenario, but going through them to pull out more can be frustrating. You're going to need a system for organization in this game.

The mechanics of this game vary from scenario to scenario, which I love, and there is an obvious timer factor. If you're a completionist type personality this game is going to suck.

Going insane adds a great dynamic to this game. Even if you go insane it may work for you. You may win because you went insane while everyone else loses. Who knows what is going to happen?

As a fan of Eldritch Horror, we decided to go ahead and purchase this game to add to our Lovecraftian collection. In my opinion Eldritch feels like an Indiana Jones adventure that you’re flying from location to location gaining clues and weapons and trying to beat the countdown. Mansions feels a lot more like a horror where the monster actually follow you and you feel a lot more helpless. You’re still gaining clues and weapons but I think the actual “mystery” in this game is incorporated a little better then Eldritch. Both are great games but they scratch a slightly different itch. I enjoy the miniatures in this game and the tile laying as well. All in all the components are pretty solid and look great when it hits the table. And yes this game is dependent on the app, which I don’t mind, but at times I find to be a little distracting from physical gameplay. In my opinion I think this game works best as a solo or 2 player game due to the use of a device. At the end of the day I like Eldritch more but I would highly recommend this game.

Oh man where to start.  You start off somehow almost completely unprepared (I'll go with one spell or one weapon and NOTHING ELSE, that will be totally fine!).  The randomness in the die roles coupled with the fact that you rarely get to choose what stat you are even testing against means your success or failures are just totally random.

You finally get to the end of the scenario which you feel you are running full speed at, and lo and behold the same thing happens in every scenario, a giant monster spawns.  This monster is extremely hard to kill and will absolutely destroy you EVEN IF YOU ATTACK IT!  Finally when you go insane you have some new stupid victory condition which makes you leave your teammates to be selfish and attempt to win which often makes everyone lose.  Really, really bad.

I am a sucker for these Cthulhu games, and this one is by far my favorite, even before the second edition, which amped it up to a whole new level. This is a great game, for the story. Coming to a closed door and hearing mumbling in a foreign language coming from the other side then deciding whether or not to open it. These are the decisions that make me so happy. Minor quibble is I wish more scenarios came with the base game. But that is nothing compared to the fun each of them brings.

Amazing adventure game in Cthulu theme. 
It's other game than orginal version. I think it's great and climatic.
I am not rating that 10 just because I have played it just 2 times. But I think It will go up.

I never played the first edition because I don't like board games with a "dungeon master", but I jumped all over the second edition when I found out that the monster player is now played by an app. This game is so thematic, tense, and fun. Its the closest you can get to Cthulu roleplaying without an actual RPG.

RATING: 4.5
Based on 1 solo play of Cycle of Eternity which I won playing as 2 investigators (though I doubt more plays with more people would change my opinion).

I'm a little conflicted about this game, so I will try to summarize what I liked and what I disliked. But first of all let's talk about the app. Well, the app handles almost everything for you, except moving around and finding/drawing cards from their decks. And I guess that's fine, because it would require an enourmous amount of cards, tokens and bookkeeping if there were no app. I also liked the puzzles, even though the ones I came across were way too easy. My problems with the game are not about the app per se. 

+ The artwork is nice 
+ In theory I like the aspect of upgrading your investigator through items and spells (even though you have little control over what you are getting, basically just a few hints from the app/tile. I mean you are not gonna find a sledgehammer in a pile of papers..)
+ When you start playing for the first time, the first 20 minutes or so feels amazing. It feels like you have so much to explore and solve. 
+ It's an awesome premise. Horror, mystery, investigations. If this game was mechanically fun and interesting, it could have been love. 

- It such a passive experience. Not necessarily because of the app, but because the outcome of the decisions you make are always based on some random diceroll, or other randomness. 

- The few decisions you make in the game are obvious. Do I search this search icon that are in the same space as I? Of course I do, what else am I gonna do in here! 

- Did I mention the dice rolls? You better like it, because you are gonna roll A LOT of them. Search the cabinet - roll the dice, attack the monster - roll the dice, evade the monster - roll the dice, talk to a person - roll the dice, monster attacks - roll the dice, monster eats an eel - roll the freaking dice again. 

- The minis are bad quality and the mini bases are annoying. Eventually I just used the monster tokens on the tiles. 

- Ok I only played one scenario, but half way through I didn't care for the story anymore. I'm not a Lovecraftian hardcore fan, but I have enjoyed other Cthulhu games. This game rely a lot on it's storytelling, but it didn't work for me. 

- I didn't feel that I was actually "solving" anything by the end of it. 

- Most items and spells you get feels random, and more often than not end up being almost totally useless for your investigator/situation. 

- Even though the app handles stuff for you, I think I would rather go for Eldritch Horror than this. In EH you at least keep your mind occupied all the time, since there is no app that's is telling you what is happening. 

I am not sure yet if I will go this another go, or just get it out the door now. Right now I am not very tempted to try again.

EDIT: Sold my copy of the game

I am very torn on this one. It is undoubtedly cool, and probably as a design even better than 1st Edition MoM.
BUT, I wholeheartedly agree with the ones that say that, in this alleged BOARD-game, there is no actual need for the board, nor the cards, miniatures or anything at all that isn't the app itself. Actually I think that the switching between the app and the physical components detracts from, and not adds to, the experience.
So, as a boardgame I find it lacking. As a roleplaying experience, even if the scenarios are well done, MoM doesn't cut it compared to "real" pen-and-paper RPGs. In the end, it is not a game that I could recommend, particularly at this price tag.

Great game for those who enoyed betrayal at house on the hill, featuring tile-based exploration this game is more focused on story driven investigation of the world around you based on a chosen scenario,

The large tiles feature multiple spaces - each of which can have searchable features within to discover hints at how to foil the evil goings on and who is purpotrating them or explore markers to reveal a new tile of the mansion/town/forest and it's contents. Each time you want to interact with something you just tap it's corresponding symbol on the app map and it explains what you find and how you can interact with it.

Gameplay is relatively simply and quick to pick up with 2 actions per investigator then swapping over to the monster or Mythos phase where something weird happens and enemies move, attack and cause psychological horror to the investigators.

The whole game is also driven by the App, the first edition required a player to determine which tiles went where, what monster spawned etc. in a more formal pen and paper RPG role while now all of that is left to the app and you can enjoy the game single player or co-op with 4 friends as well as yourself. 

Miniatures can be painted if you're into that scene or simply used as-is. The models themselves look great and come on firm bases that the monster cards can slot into exposing their key stats for reference (if space is an issue you can always just use the monster cards alone).

Games range from 1-6 hours depending how in-depth of an investigation you want to do, exploring just a single mansion with a self-contained plot, or exploring each district of a famous port town over several days discovering what evil plans are afoot and who is responsible. The objective is usually to stop who is responsible by exploring and discovering involvement and evidence cards or survive the reprecussions of failing to prevent something happening which can lead to a violent showdown.

Losing an investigator does only leave you with one turn left to finish the game, so keeping people alive is a high priorty. Taking your max health in damage or max sanity in horror damage will result in a permanent effect for the rest of the game - broken legs that reduce movement, or insanity effects only that player is allowed to know that can turn them into enemies on the sly or alter the success conditions.

Every game is randomised where possible - mostly in the monsters that spawn, mythos events, horror descriptors and skill check flavour texts. Layouts of the scenario being played can vary between a few different designs and those can be varied further with more tiles for the game to work with. Core elements of each scenario will remain the same as the antagonists and their plans are consistent but the App will prevent you solving the mystery right away if you don't have a certain key or evidence for your investigator to know where to go or who to apprehend.

Ultimately there is still room for replayability both solo and with friends and the expansions reinforce that. There are additional scenarios for each of the expansions (the first edition re-box Reoccuring Nightmares and the first edition expansions re-box Suppressed Memories) and one additional scenario for use with the 2nd edition parts as a DLC.

With another expansion specifically for 2nd Ed. called 'Beyond the Threshold' coming this year it looks like the game has only just begun its lifecycle and has plenty of potential to offer.

Another one of those archetypal Ameritrash games, along the lines of Fortune and Glory and Arkham horror.

Sometimes, technology has to be introduced to improve a board game, and nothing could be more true in the case of MoM 2nd edition.  Using the app with this new version actually makes this game a joy to play.  Despite a few complaints, it has quickly become one of my all time favorites.  Definitely a keeper!

Beautiful and thematic, but too fiddly with the upkeep (despite a great app) and a bit too repetitive. I wish the players had more interesting decisions to make and that there were more actual puzzles to solve instead of standard ability rolls. It's still a good, intriguing game, but Arkham Horror: The Card Game provides a more satisfying gaming experience due to a better card management system and wider decision tree.

I have to check out some more advanced scenarios, the game probably has much more to offer. The rating may go up.

BIG box. The app takes away the setup time. It also takes away the dungeon master role except that it doesn't, rather it just means the the one who has to do all the reading and screen tapping can play too. I enjoy the game itself however call me old fashioned but I just don't like the use of mobile technology, there is too much of it in th world without needing it for playing a board game.

I like the game as much as first edition.  Which is a little disappointing, yet I wouldn't call the game itself disappointing.  the game is fun and exciting and mysterious.  I enjoyed it and I look forward to playing again.  My point is I just got all the same feelings from first edition anyway.  I am a little bummed that first edition is now essentially obsolete.  I will very likely never use any of those cards ever again... that's a lot of cards.  Some people will argue that first ed and second ed are different games and you don't need to drop one for the other.  For us, I can confidently say we would never play first ed now that we own second.  

Update as of 9/20/17: I have downgraded 2nd ed from a 7 to a 6. I have tried to pinpoint what irked me about this design. At first I thought it was the Insane condition cards (which I very strongly dislike) but that wasn't the main issue. Recently, we played a scenario with an awesome story and sweet mystery. We played and discovered so much, and the game shifted into the second half. Monsters spawned and started attacking an NPC, but they never dealt any damage. They just stalled out the NPC. We proceeded to run up and just roll the dice until we got enough success to kill them and then move on with the interesting story.

This part of rolling, rolling, and rolling dice is boring. It takes away the immersion. "Fortunately" we were able to roll enough successes in order to win, but by that point, we just didn't care any more. I do think you should play this game if you are interested, but I would love to never have to play again. Oddly enough, maybe I now have a decent reason to return to first edition.

As a huge HP Lovecraft fan, this game hits all the right marks and does it with terrific presentation. It's hard to believe an app driven game can do so well. As a bonus, the new version comes with uodated cards and tokens for your 1st edition pieces, so they're all still useable in this version!

This one gets dinged a point for being Cthulhu themed, so if you like that, feel free to bump this up to an 8. Apps are the future for many cooperative board games and some one-versus-many games and this game makes that obvious. Instead of having one person run the game, now everyone gets to play and the app takes care of the game state.

You're still rolling dice and if that annoys you, don't even bother. Yet, I had fun and would be willing to play again.

Reimplemented with the reliance of an app to run the AI Game Master. You tell the app what you did and the app tells you what to do next. It feels redundant to replicate the placement of all the rooms and tokens we see on the app screen onto the board game. Why not just do everything on the app? I do love having all players in the dark against the app keeper. It would be interesting to see this pulled off with just paper and bits.

Mansions of Madness has always been a "once or twice per year" game for my group, and the second edition doesn't change that.  Others in the same category:  Android, Legend of the Moonsword, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Doom.

The original was reasonably priced, but was a bear to set up.  The new one is the bizarro anti-version: set-up is now negligible, but you have to lay down a lot more cash to ride.  The stiff price hike means that I can't justify grabbing the update, particularly since set-up doesn't matter when you rarely play.

Content-wise, the ambient music in version 2 is cool.  But otherwise the app seems malnourished.  Minimally, each scenario deserves event-based sound effects - where's that music box you keep mentioning? - and a half-dozen more voiceovers. For an app game, there's an awful lot of read-aloud by the players.  And it wouldn't hurt for the evasion and attack text to be repeated far less often.

Ironically, my biggest problem with MoM v2 is that, electronics aside, it's just too similar to the original.  The game could benefit from new and exciting app-supported mechanics that shake things up.

Like what exactly?  I'm not sure.  Secret mumblings for insane players, maybe. Event descriptions that change, depending on your character's location. Random jump scares.  An occasional dexterity aspect to failed combat rolls. Angels with dirty faces. I dunno, just something. 

I do like the app-based puzzles, though.  Good call.

Had the first edition, I did like it. While I didn't like the setup (nor the errors in the rulebook).
Now with the implementation of the app, I wanted to try it again.

Sooooo... It's ok. I don't like the app as much as I thought, partly because there is no "back" button (in case you accidentally touch the screen while reading the mythos phase instructions). Monsters and items aren't tracked on the app either.
Which is a bit of a pain.
I guess that's because you could skip the physical product and just play the app in case it did that.

In a way I think an all app implementation would be better (for me).

Other negatives for me
- Play time is way longer than suggested
- I don't like the Insanity / Wounded mechanic (I just love PURE coop)
- Bases of the mini's are ugly and not terribly handy

Probably will play again, won't buy.

Impressions on first play - overall, it felt a bit like a needless complicated 'Betrayal at House on the Hill', without doing enough to address the popular criticism of that game (that you don't really know how to prep for the haunt phase during the exploration phase).

This game is so addicting! I love the app aspect of it as it really alters the difficulty of each playthrough. The maps are different, the starting equipment is different, and the game increases the difficulty if you start running through things too quickly. It really makes the gameplay way more dynamic.

Even though we've only won once out of the 5 playthroughs we've done so far, we still love playing the stories over to try our hand at winning again. The single player aspect is equally thrilling. All in all, our favorite game of 2016.

I was skeptical the game would live up to the hype, but for me it absolutely did. Everything positive people have been saying about this game (e.g. the game is extremely thematic, the app is fantastic and well-implemented) rings true. All five scenarios I’ve played have felt suitably different from each other and there hasn’t been a dud among them. Despite how much I enjoyed Elder Sign and Eldritch Horror, Mansions of Madness 2.0 has become my favorite Arkham Horror Files game, hands-down. I feel so fortunate that Kevin decided to gift this to me, because we’ve been having an absolute blast with it and continue to look forward to many more plays.

The miniature quality is quite poor - from a component standpoint, this game has no business carrying a $99 MSRP.  The tiles are very nice.  Non-miniature components are typical FFG quality.  I haven't had any trouble with the app, so no complaints there.  Gameplay is fun, but with the way the app is integrated, there's NO reason this needed to be a board game instead of purely a digital app.  Even still, I found it to be a really fun experience - and apparently I liked it enough to paint all the minis (first complete game doing so) and re-base them onto Litko clear bases. The people I've introduced it to have also liked the game quite a bit.  FFG apparently did something right.

RATING: 4
The app provides an atmospheric backdrop to the game with the music and narrative it also manages a large amount of the book keeping speeding set up time up significantly. The game is very dice dependent and luck driven and it can be long too (sometimes too long). There will be times where after several hours of play the game will be decided not by how well you've planned but by the roll of the dice. After two plays I'm looking forward to exploring more of the investigations but I have my reservations about the luck factor in a game of this length.

This is the first board game I have bought that I keenly felt like I paid too much for it. The high price point is not really justified - huge amounts of the art are reused from other titles and the miniatures are substandard compared to other FFG products (Imperial Assault). The app would have cost for development though and I think that the app is very strong so there is that - I guess I just don't appreciate that so much since it is not tangible in the same way that the miniatures are.

It is a fun and immersive game and ultimately that's what counts. I need to get in several more plays before my evaluation matures but I'm starting this at an 8.
 I have dropped my rating of this considerably since I feel like it is far too random and far too long - You can invest upwards of three hours in a story and then lose to arbitrary damage/ horror hand outs and bad dice rolls. I wouldn't mind the random elements if the game was shorter and there was less emphasis on the story.

Wow, after a long break from the game I have tried it again and really loathed it. It felt like the game was intentionally designed to waste time and obfuscate interesting choices in needless layers of nonsense. The actions are limited the time spent clicking through the app and moving everything procedural;y is unforgivable the combat is dreadful and the atmosphere is short lived as it gets bogged down in the mire of fiddling around with the pieces. Poor die rolls are crippling, the health and sanity cards lead to further time wasting. For example I had to flip a sanity card that made me drop two items, then my character got stunned which meant they could only perform one action. Therefore as my only action I could pick up the items I dropped and my turn would be over. Now we go through the entire charade of moving monsters about and rolling horror checks again so I can have two more actions. So uninteresting, what a waste of an afternoon.

First game I have ever played with an app tied into it. I would hope this is the worst of these.

Seperately the board game on its own if you replaced the app aspects with cards would also have been a very bad game. Decisions on what you did with your character don't mean much since you don't know what aspect of your character will be used for any action and there isn't a mechanic that tells you ahead of time in too many cases.

If it was just an app and all the board game aspects were managed in app, that app would be even worse.  Feels like one of the crappier games you would have played back in the Windows 3.1 days. Just background mood music that you would think would have sound effects or change with events but it doesn't. Text to read about what randomly happened like reading from an event card pile.  If you click continue there is no going back and reading what you missed or correcting a mistake.

The mix of the 2 together I think makes both somehow worse. Things that seemed like it should be handled in app it had you handle on your own and vice versa.  The biggest downfall of it though is the having the app be the focal point of everything took away from the community interaction feel of a boardgame.

I would hope this is just one of the worst implementation of an app into a game.  It seems like as just a small mechanism would work much better, but maybe this is just a short terrible trend like VCR board games.

That all being said this is clearly a game not built for me.  Others I played with seem to enjoy it more.  I can enjoy cooperative and/or thematic games, but I tend to enjoy them less.  This one is the least enjoyable modern game I have played so far.

After the disastrous, braindead XCOM, I'm reluctant to even try this app-driven, fully cooperative monstrosity of a "boardgame". The first edition is still the perfect gateway game, thank you very much.

More research needed. Is replayability good enough? Do I like this type of playstyle good enough?

Thematic to the nines. Gives you a real sense of foreboding then a sense of panic when things kick off. Replayability is not superb with the game coming with 4 scenarios out only 9 that you can get (by buying expansions). The first playthough of each is the best but on subsequent playthroughs, the surprises are gone. You are then left with a very good dungeon crawler.

Had an absolute blast playing this game with 3 friends.  The app worked great and kept the game moving along at a nice pace.  The story was well put together and made sense.  Can't wait to play again!

I love this game and every aspect of it. It's the perfect mix between board game and roleplaying game.

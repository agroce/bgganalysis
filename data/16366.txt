We laughed a lot.  We were bemused by the rules.
We had a great time.
But is it a great game? I'm not so sure.  I got stuffed by the cards.
But it was fun.

I should bring this to Pittsburgh next time I'm home!

Very wonderful theme and fun gameplay.  Played this one at the beach with Chris and Sue and Kara and Jean, last summer.  So much changes in one year...maybe part of why I like the game so much is the theme resonates so well with growing older and looking backwards at decisions and important events and how everything ends up playing out.   23rd birthday gift from Kristen!

Very witty and cleverly designed to create laugh-out-loud moments whilst still working as a (simple) strategic game. It requires the right players: people who won't take it all too seriously. The rules are a little vague in places, but this is more an experience than a deep Euro-game. Great artwork and a lot of fun.

Not only is this a good game for the geeky variety, but non-gamers enjoy the well implemented theme of this game.  This definitely counts as a game that's "dripping with theme."  

Most say it's "a good game for the right crowd".  Really?  More like it's a good for everyone except your grandparents.  Get a sense of humor people.

I actually absolutely love this game; however, the people I play with have said that they'd rate it average due to the auction-style gameplay. Everyone's come away with stories about gay sex, drugs and rock and roll, and a good time was always had by all. People not playing can't help but listen in to the absolute scandal that this game permits!

RATING: N/A
The theme is "funny" indeed, as a game it seems to work quite well but you definitely need to pick your crowd when you are trying to increase your score in sexual partners, alcohol intake and drug usage. I must admit it is quite light hearted and not very seedy. Once you get past the theme it is not all that exciting.

Interesting topic and the game mechanics work! It is a card game and it is subject to the limitations of the genre. That is, if you get a rotten deal there is little you can do. However, you gotta love a game where one player has to say to each opponent, "Would you have pity sex with me?"

Yet another game I really wanted to like, but just didn't.

Sure, it's "edgy."  Whoop-de-doo.  Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate and laugh at the cards, but the humor in the art/theme/cards just doesn't match up with the relatively dry gameplay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
I really wanted to like this game, but found the mechanics to be uninspired. There is really no sense of tension or surprise. Play continues till somebody finishes their personal stories. Ultimately, the gameplay seem to be one LONG preface to telling a coherent (and humorous) story of your characters life. That, in itself, isn't bad but the gameplay should feel more the emphasis and not a secondary necessity.

Seems longer than it ought to be for a game of its (relatively light) weight. If you're in the mood for something silly, it's good for a laugh, though I wonder how well that will hold up when the novelty wears off. If nothing else, it's a good change of pace and sure to generate some good interaction among players. I think only the most extremely easily-offended adult will have problems with content.

Doesn't grab me, but by no means a terrible game.  A simple bidding game while balancing the values of different things (drugs, depression, smoking, weight, etc).  Not deep enough to be worth playing more than a few times, in my opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Went down a notch after 2nd play. The novelty/fun factor isn't as strong as in the first game, and some weaknesses show (mainly balance issues with some of the life goal cards, and downtime in the 6-player game - I've only played those so far). On the surface this one looks to be a good game for non-gamers, but when you look deeper I guess that mainly gamers will stay with it.

Update: Experience teaches that non-games WILL want to come back to this game for theme and silliness alone!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An odd game. Either ribald and funny or extremely awkward, and you never can tell who will react to it in what way. I like it a lot, but it's more a vehicle for laughter and socialization than a serious game -- and I think it's treating it like a game that kills it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The theme may not appeal to many people, but the theme is typical of Euros - meaning, it lies pretty lightly on the underlying game mechanics.  The mechanics in this game are a integrated set of scales that move in relation to each other when specific actions are taken.  The challenge for the players is to manipulate their character to accomplish life goals.  These life goals seem at the heart of any contraversy with this game (which is foolishness in my mind).  If you are the type that beleives that playing the bad guy in a movie makes you evil, then avoid this game.  If you are able to see beyond that and have fun with the offbeat and alternative characters portrayed in the game, by all means give this one a chance.  You'll find that it can be real hoot trying to develop an addiction while finding the love of your life.

7/19/14: played for the first time in years.  This time what I appreciated was the story arc.  More enjoyable than I remember it being.  The downside is that the rules are very vague.

This game might actually be more fun to listen to it being played in the next room than it is to play.  Overhearing hilarious comments at the next gaming table has derailed my train of thought during many evenings of gameplay.  Key elements of this game are drug and alcohol addictions, as well as sex.  This game is not for everyone.  

I'm giving the German version a slight bump over the English edition.  The artwork is slightly less edgy in the English edition.

RATING: 5
Great concept, wonderful assortment of life events, but ultimately the gameplay just can't back it up. The auction mechanic isn't much fun, the rules are messy and the whole 'call' system to get other players involved is very cumbersome. Furthermore you're only really focused on building your own tableu and since you don't know the other players' goals the outcome of your influence on others is very random: taking someone with you on an event can mean you mess up one of their life goals or actually helping them out more than yourself. 
These things could be fun if they were done deliberately, but having swings like these happen accidently isn't that much fun. Of course it could be argued that unexpected outcomes are just what makes this especially life like and after all that's what this game is about.
Nevertheless, clunky rules and rather boring mechanics were enough reasons to ultimately let go of it. Sadly, since the concept of the game is one of my absolute favorites.

RATING: 6
Funny friends was a very interesting game.
The rules were very complex to understand (specifically about when you could tap the other players as friends).

An intriguing premise and it provoked some great conversation and many laughs.  That alone would make it an awesome game in my book, but the complicated rules really pull this down from being highly rated, I think.

I would love to get my questions answered and try again.

Could have been better. I wanted a fun game to bring out with some non-gamers, after a few beers, but there are too many components, unclear rules and confusion. I figured "funny friends" sounds fun. Not so  much. 
And as a serious game? I don't think you can take this game seriously.

I hated this after my first play, but gave it two more plays. It's funny, but I think that it's confused. It's a planning game that removes control at every turn. If it were half the time, it would be good. As it is, I don't care for it particularly.

An ambitious thematic idea,but unfortunately the theme is incorporated only in the cards,while the game mechanics are very abstract.Maybe if the various traits had effects on your strategy or bestowed different abilities the gameplay would be better.Anyhow,can be a great game if the group supports it.Exceptional minimalistic artwork.

What a game!!! This is a game you won't forget, it is really hot. Not the playing system is the most important, it's the discussion afterwards. We had a lot of fun and laughter, although the game itself isn't that easy; Even with some faults it still is funny. 
But once the newity is gone, the game becomes a bit boring. So I lowered my score.

I enjoyed my one playing, but I suspect that, if I owned it, I would never really be able to play it again. I play in my home and there are kids there, I play in public, and anyone could be there, and I play at the homes of friends, and they all have kids.

You see, the game is good, and FF's got a great sense of humor, and that really comes through, but ultimately, the Green Master has made a game that is too blue for me to really enjoy.

The laughs ended after the first 30 minutes. After the game I felt sad that if the theme were fit all of life would boil down to a few well timed decisions of adjusting consumption slider bars and knowing how much time to bid to make such adjustments. Aside from the shortly entertaining theme the game is stale and full of AP.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
A game where 90% of the attraction seems to come from the banter that spills from the actions and cards but doesn't actually contribute to the strategy or outcome.

Actions depend upon secret cards that set your goals. However you just seem to concentrate on your own targets and leave everyone else to plough their own furrow. Success is largely at the mercy of the totally random card draw. Future unrevealled actions can be utterly blocked by your earlier well meaning selections. Luck is a heavily significant part of this game.

If the rules weren't so fiddly and there weren't so many tiny un-managable pieces, the feel of this game would be best suited to an after dinner party outing (balderdash scruples etc). However the rule book is too much to be picked up in less than 30 minutes and the random lottery of the card draw precludes any strategy or forward planning. At best a bit of fun but the theme crushes any gameplay.

Though a bad game with a moot theme, Fiese Freunde Fette Feten turns out surprisingly enjoyable: what makes the wonder is, it feels and plays slightly like an RPG, as you have to make choices that affect your own character.
This also adds to the narrative, as a wide range of comments, giggles and remarks usually follows every action you take, which really helps keep the atmosphere friendly amd light-hearted. [i](September 2011)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - I’ve been playing Fiese Freunde Fette Feten a few more times recently and it never failed to provide us with fun: thus, during my Fall 2015 rating revise I rounded up my rating from 7,5 to 8.

Needs to be the right crowd with the right attitude.  i.e., people who aren't taking the game *that* seriously and keep it moving.  

Edit:  Played with five and had a good time.  It moved a little slow as others were learning the game.  Finally understood how the phones work and boy, those are important.  Lots of laughs and comments.  I feel it will hold up under plays, in fact, I think it would get better as the mechanics of the game will be set allowing for fun, chatting without worrying about how things work.  I raised it to a 7 as it is good with the right crowd.

update: 9/09 - back to a six.  The damn phone rule again slowed things down.  Game needs to be loose and not a lot of refresh.  We just don't play it enough to not refresh.  I think it will settle in at 6.  

update: 6/2012 - I suck at this but I like it.

Like many card-based games, luck has far too large a factor in determining a player's fate. It is possible to get a set of goals that require precise sequence events to accomplish... meaning you most likely ain't gonna get 'em. I like the artwork though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very clever and hip game about adult life, goals, and friendships. The bidding, passing, and goal-meeting mechanics feel similar to Traumfabrik's, but are much more complex as your (game-made) friends have some influence on whether or not your life goals goals are met. Production values are top notch and the game is pretty fun, though you may find yourself wrestling with the rules rather than enjoying the play of cards and topics on the first couple of plays. I guess it depends on whether you want your real-life analogies on the level of an easy-to-play Chez Geek or a more complex Funny Friends.

The Game of Life meets the school of hard knocks... that's my best way of describing the off-beat humor of this game.  Amusing for 1 play, but it will fade with time.

Clever.  Witty.  Reduces grown men to chortling, giggling schoolboys who act as if they just got away with smoking chronic in the fourth-floor lavatories.

RATING: 7.6
Hilarious game. Not at all politically correct. The object is to fulfill various 'life goals' by gaining experience in such useful pursuits as drugs, alcohol, sex, knowledge and grief. There is a bidding component and possible but slight screw your neighbor/kingmaking component when it comes to making someone your 'friend.' There is a game here, although it was universally agreed that it dragged just a tad with 6 and that the goals should be limited to perhaps 4 instead of 5. We laughed all the way through.

Es un juego en el que cada personaje desarrolla su experiencia vital y debe cumplir una serie de objetivos. Existe una fase de pubertad en la que las experiencias que viven configuran cómo inicias el juego (en qué estado está los parámetros de tu pesonaje, que son fumar, algohol, drogas, conocimiento, misticismo, gordura, y no se si alguno mas). 
Una vez realizada la pubertad, por subasta se van otorgando experiencias vitales que te permiten ir variando los parámetros, para cumplir los objetivos. Los jugadores se pueden relacionar unos con otros. Eljuego es muy divertido porque las experiencias dan pie a cachondeo. Mejor para jugar en grupos amplios. Es un juego de mucho folleteo, así que no es para jugar con los hijos... A pesar de ser un eurogame, el tema le hace equiparable a un party. Alfinal de la partida, cada jugador, según los objetivos cumplidos y las experiencias pasadas, tiene un resumen de toda su vida. Está muy simpático... se pasa un buen rato.

Loads of fun -- unless you're politically correct, in which case you should NOT be playing this game.  Not condusive to control-freak play (which is usually me) because of the luck of the draw, but entertaining enough that it doesn't bother me.  Almost like the bastard child of a true Euro and a party game.  WARNING:  Do NOT play this game with people you don't like!  Since you can't refuse a relationship it can become intensely creepy.

May not be deep but FFFF is certainly entertaining and engrossing.  Really rich and fun theme here and the play results in lots of laughs.

Funny Friends is one of those (FF) games that seems more fun with more players.  Like most of his games, though, I found this not to be true, at least in our 4 player outing - the addition of extra people slowed the game down, and really, the social element to this game is not super strong, the neutral friends are just as good as real people.  I could see this being more of a raucous, raunchy good time if you are playing with experienced players AND had the German version.  Anyway, there is a surprisingly good game in here, much of it based around timing and being able to accomplish multiple tasks with the fewest card selections.  Better than average for FF, but probably won't hit the table so often.  Great theme though!  Wish someone would design a heavier, more "serious" game around this theme.

RATING: 4
Any game where I have the 'Oh god, please let this game be over' feeling can't score above a 5 in my book.  I also feel the auction mechanic is completely unnecessary and really hate the restrictions the game puts on your options.  I needed one thing and it came up three times in one auction but I was not allowed to bid on it because of the prerequisites.  *Sigh*.  I really enjoy the humor and I really feel there is a classic filler hiding underneath all the confusing rules and chrome, but as it stands, its just too long, fiddly, and luck-based for what its going for.  All in all, it breaks down into who gets the lucky cards to fulfill their hidden objectives first.  Should be a 2 for me, but the theme is very strong and there is something great about having sex and children with person on your right and then leaving them for the person on your left.

First time out of the gate, I enjoyed this game but knew that we didn't play this just as the author had intended. After a re-read of the rules (confusing in spots) my suspicions were confirmed. I want to play this one again. Really great graphics and super funny adult themed game.

RATING: 8
Best-themed German game EVER!  Nice and edgy, not the usual innocuous tripe put out by most designers.  Fun gameplay, albeit a tad long, and some of the symbols are difficult to intepret properly--I remember getting all the sex I needed for one goal, only to find out I needed GAY sex!  D'oh!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very funny, very inappropriate; I don't know that I'd want to play this often, especially since it can last a long time.  It's a game that can get old after a few plays since the theme is sort of gimicky.  Some of the goals seemed inordinately difficult to complete; a person dealt difficult or completely contradictory goals would have trouble winning the game.

I've only played the German version, and part of the fun there was trying to figure out what the cards were supposed to represent.  ("He has a fish on his head *why*??")

RATING: 7
I had a good laugh playing this one. Some goals are going to be easier to fulfil than others so it is fairly luck dependent, which will cut into the replayability as a serious strategy game. However, that isn't what it is about. It is a light game to have fun with and it certainly succeeds at that.

RATING: N/A
Clever, funny... The way the mechanics work together seems well thought out. The auction also works well. I could see it with a Renaissance theme, or industrial theme... so good work with the lively, surprising theme. But even so, I don't really care to play it again. (2+hrs w/5p)

We have finally played this with a group and it was a lot of fun!  It's much more interesting when you are bidding on cards with four people as opposed to two.  Still a great game to break out because of the theme.  How fun is it to do things in a game that you would never (hopefully) do in real life?  Finally understanding how the relationship and call markers work flesh out this game.

Got this free at CABS (thanks Jay and RRG!)

It seems like an attempt to sell a Euro with an Ameritrash theme, but it seems that while the theme is pretty funny (even if it was toned down for us puritan Americans) it doesn't come out in the game play (just like in every other Euro). This leaves an okay auction / tile game that is neither too good or too bad.

The game is just ok. A satirical theme blended with set collection and bidding, but the game felt too much of a luck fest for its length, and the rules were a bit of a chore. There are some interested forced player interactions, but I didn't feel I wanted to explore them further. I am glad I played it and I enjoyed the satire and artwork, but I don't think it's really worth the shelf space. Interesting concept, but an underdeveloped game.

Hilarious game! Doesn't get as many plays because of the length and the fact there are a tad too many rules to just pop it on the table and play it... Would love to get the English version as well, so I could enjoy it with non-Dutch speakers as well!

RATING: 5
Well, this game obviously fits certain personalities like a glove and repels others. I knew from the get-go that the idea behind this game would appeal to me, and given its niche, the game play decent, albeit more experience-oriented than I would ideally like.

This is basically a gamer's party game, and is all about timing, grabbing the cards you need when they show up, and being aggressive about changing life goals when you need to. 

One thing that could be a potential problem for some people is that this game is fairly involved for a party game, which is basically what this is trying to be. If you have people who are sort of "fringe" gamers (significant others who play medium weight stuff on occasion) than you will have no problems getting this on the table, but this still has enough rules to kerfuddle people who really aren't gamers. This is both good and bad, it is good in that I need some level of meaningful planning and meat to enjoy a game and it has it. It is bad in that this is the type of game that is much more fun to play with non-gamer pals, and it is a little more difficult to get onto the table as a result.

I enjoyed my single play of the game, but I sold my copy because I think it is filling a niche that is too specialized for me to own it. The actual game itself really isn't that good, and as much as I wanted to like it because of Friese's humour, it still only came across as worth playing every once in a great while. The most important element of the game, the phone chits, are confusing in their implementation, and are a touch too limited as well. Looking through the cards once or twice is great, some of the art, like the original heavy petting card, is flat out fantastic, but the game itself does not meet the lofty heights that the Maura art seems to promise. I would love to see Friese revisit this theme and turn it into a board game with more control, as the idea is solid gold.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Funny, politically incorrect, and often vulgar game that has fairly inobstrusive mechanics that make for a very social, interactive experience.  The game features more sex than most boardgamers will have in their lifetimes, so if you're one of those who look to gaming as a substitute for actual life experiences and achievements, look no further.  It's a lot of fun, but it is something of a one-trick pony and it seems to play a little longer than it ought to.  Accomplishing some of the goals can be rather tricky (or impossible in some situations), but the game is about fun instead of winning anyway.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.9
Great theme, great artwork, fun simple game. Sometimes a bit long, maybe gameplay can speed up is you are allowed to play more than one goal card in your turn. The rulebook presents the rather simple rules in a bit unstructured way. Lots of luck. I find the auctions in Friesematenten more dynamic. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rating is based on one play with 2 players.  There wasn't as much relationship-building between the players as I expected since, with only 2 players, 8 neutral players are added into the game.  Also, stepping out early became an issue as it created a buffet of cards for the other player.  Even with these minor issues the game was still quite fun & I fully expect that my rating will improve when tried with more players.

While it was amusingly dark fun, it dragged a bit in the 6 six player game we tried. Looking forward to trying it with 4 players.My second game with 5 people went much quicker and was pretty smooth.

Rated as a two but rating not logged since I have never played it. It is not that this game is bad as a game but this game is offensive to me so I won't play it.

The only game in my collection that I won't play with my son.  This game is so damn funny and 'adult' without being pornographic or raunchy.  We must have stopped our first game and laughed for five minutes over art on the sperm donor card.  The humor has held up very well under repeated plays ... but I'm still not sure we're getting the cell phone rules right.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game has an interesting premise in that each player is a character selecting things to do with their life in order to achieve goals.  The first player to reach 5 goals ends the game and becomes the winner.

This game has one of the most poorly written rulebooks I've encountered.  I've heard complaints about other rulebooks that we've been relieved not to have trouble interpreting.  However, this one - we found cards with symbols that weren't explained, we both repeatedly read particular paragraphs that we could glean no meaning from.  We're hoping to find something better here on BGG otherwise it's unlikely this game will again see the light of day.

I had no real intention to ever play this, as I'm one of those people who doesn't find locker-room humor funny. I ended up playing because that's what the group decided to play with 6, and I wasn't afraid of the content enough to completely sit out. Given that that probably biases me sufficiently, that's probably all anyone needs to know about my opinion on this. Nevertheless, I will say that the game wasn't bad. It actually felt like a development of FFF (Fische...) without the board to move around on. But as if the humor in the game wasn't bad enough, the comments that it encourages from the players, while I assume hilarious to those making them, are to me not funny at best, and approaching offensive at worst.

RATING: 5.8
The game is a very different game with lots of intended and maybe some unintended player interaction.  Some of the rules are a bit too complex and the theme and action cards do not make this a "family game".  Could be lots of fun in a mixed group of men and women.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
FVVF is not a game: it is a torture device. The sole fun comes from thumbing through the cards and laughing at the various pictures, and perhaps listening in on the table talk. The problems start with the rules, which are lengthy and vague; somehow the spirit of the material isn't carried on in the rules itself. The game bits are tiny, hard to see across the table, and sometimes superfluous—phones you don't really need, for example. Gamewise, the game is made up of a seemingly endless stream of uninspired auctions; at the same time you need to be friends with someone in order for the interaction to work. Since you can't make yourself a friend, you can be locked out of the game if others don't like you. Wheeee....

This game is an example of what happens when a very strong idea is more or less hammered into a game. These occurrences are rather rare, and you'd hope that it works, but not here. This game suffers to a great extent from not having been playtested sufficiently: the testers were obviously charmed enough by the cards to ignore that they were supposed to test the game. But since there isn't much of a game game in there in the first place, I guess they got confused, and mistook 'humorous bits' for 'actual fun'. I solemnly declare that it is my purpose in life never to play FVVF again: this gives me one money (for saving the cash spent on it), clears any depression (from the feeling of utter relief that I can avoid this horror), one wisdom (for learning that shit really does happen), but wrecks a relation (since I cannot play with anyone else anymore).

Fun theme, rather easy mechanically and good at creating amusing situations. The cards and artwork are great, my only complaint would be the rather opaque relationship-rules and some unclear instructions in the rulebook on how exactly to use the complaint tokens. Once that's cleared up, it's smooth sailing and quite enjoyable.

I really want to like this game, but my enjoyment is thwarted by the confusing rules and erratic gameplay.  The need to constantly refer to the rulebook slows the game down considerably, and there are times when you just can't do anything because the cards you need aren't present.  

No matter how fun the game can be at times, and how humorous some of the cards are, the flaws of the game often overshadow the positive aspects.  It's a shame because the theme has so much promise.

I still want to play it and figure it out though, because I feel that there is a solution to the problem.  It just might take a while to find.

It is just a game where you have to reach certain life objectives to win. 

During the game you will live your live doing all kind of crazy things, like having anonymous sex, getting married with other players or having children.

The goals you have to achieve are quire imbalanced which makes the quite random in my opinion.

For me this is a game where you play this game more for the fun of seeing how your character story develops and not really to play well and win.

If you have the right group of people, it can be really funny. I played with a very amusing group. full of humour and we had lots of fun.

Tentative rating after one play. It was a bit of a grind first time through, but I can see this being a relatively fast game to play. Its a bit random in the initial goals assigned and also when your key ingredient just doesn't come up in the cards. But randomness is fine if a) it plays fast (and this should next time) and b) its fun. And this is definitely fun in a Traumfabrik kind of way (Laughing at the outcomes is as much part of the game as actually playing it).

eg in my first game I had a delinquent upbringing stealing cigarettes, etc. Then gave up smoking, got committed to an asylum, wrote my memoirs about it and became a millionaire!

The game is good for a few laughs...and the theme is great.  However, outside of the theme and the laughs, there isn't much game here. Once you order your life goals, then it's just a race to collect the cards in the right order to most efficiently accomplish your life goals.  And if those cards don't come up, then your chances of winning go down quite a bit.

There also seem to be a lot of minutia to the rules that caused us to stall our game to figure things out.

Would like a game of this sort to have more interaction.  The theme lends itself to some cool stuff and it pretends to have interaction, but it's a mirage...there's really not much there.

I'd play it again, but I don't see it being played sporadically in our group.

Oh yeah, this game would be better as a party game if the game group wasn't all guys!!!

RATING: 5
Players are dealt a hand of five life goals ("Live Well, Get Sick", "Single and Happy", etc) and set out to achieve them.  Essentially a game where you draft cards with symbols on them, beginning at puberty, and purchase them at auction later on in later life.  These symbols slide various trait tracks up and down your character card - ciggies, alcohol, weight, religion, etc, in the hope you achieve a mix present on your life goal cards (which allows you to drop them on the table).  Eventually you will develop a circle of friends that can include your fellow players, who will accompany you on your experiences (everything from bungie jumping to sex).  That's essentially it, with a comedic theme rather nicely integrated into the design, and of course the wonderful FF artwork.  Definitely a game to play a few times, but I don't think there will be much there once the sitcom wears off.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Despite the silly theme, this is actually somewhat of a thinker.  It's a puzzle to figure out how to achieve your goal cards, and in which order, without your plans being foiled by someone else's overbid (or phone).  It's a bit frustrating when none of the cards up for auction can help you, but it's rare for this to put someone out of the game for good.

Merkle & Friese forge a fresh and fascinating game, which is full of fun! Sorry. But really, this is a great ironic take on life and the hobbies and excesses to which people strive. A lot of new ideas and ways of handling them, and it is fun to chat while playing and watch players "lives" unfold in story-esque ways. 

Storytelling elements are what makes games like Ambush of Arabian Nights fun, but here they are just perfectly integrated into the game. A great achievement!

I enjoy the premise/theme of real life very much. The artwork and situational humor was excellent.

There was a lot of downtime... a LOT of downtime. This was mainly because of the cards that flipped up...they were all detrimental to my goals. Here's the thing...the round that gave me 1 point in smoking, I "combo'ed off" and won the game. This was after 2 rounds of near complete inactivity.

So that kind of bugged me. Another game I won, in which my play didn't have much to do with it.

The game is very table-space intensive, and a bit fiddly with the little time markers, etc. I wish the designer had worked out a mechanic that wasn't bidding, and played more on the "bring a friend" interaction to make more moves a decision between   win/win, lose/lose, win/lose...I think it would have made for a much smoother game with more importance made on your decisions.

Then again, look at who the designer is. I love the ideas, just not the execution.

This is very much an experience game.  You're not trying to be overly competitive in this game.  To get the most out of Funny Friends you really need to just sit back laugh at the card images, propositioning your friends for sex/marriage, and create a little story along the way.  If played this way you will have a really great time.  It's not something I would want to play often because there just isn't a really competitive game here.  In addition, I don't think I would try playing it with someone who is easily offended as the cards and subject matter are among the most adult I've seen in a game.  This is the adult version of The Game of Life.  I probably wouldn't recommend this game with 5 or 6 because if someone drops out of a round of bidding, it could take a while before they get another turn.

As a Eurogame, there's not much "game" here to speak of. Players get randomly dealt objectives which they try to achieve through a straightforward auction game. But FF, despite its Euro roots, is actually more of an American-style "experience" game - the fun of the game is derived from the wacky theme more than anything else. Good for a laugh but the fun factor is heavily dependent on who you play with.

A funny game that's funny more than once.  The card requirements and effects are just consistently hilarious, and the combinations never get old.  Mechanics-wise, it's pretty standard Euro fare, bidding and all, but there's a lot of fun to be had here.

After repeated plays, I am not enthusiastic about the hidden variable victory conditions.  There is very little you can do to prevent another player from winning.

Likewise, I don't think the rulebook is sufficiently clear about how events involving multiple player characters work.

A great party game for couples with a sense of humour.  Some life goals are more compromising than others but then, if all we ever wanted to do was to erect medieval monuments or lay some tracks, we wouldn't experiment with FF's wacky games.  Very crowd dependent but a hoot nevertheless.

As a game, it's better than I expected. Much better than reading the very poorly written rules will let you believe. And with a nice open group it is an opportunity for so many jokes. It can really work at creating an ambiance. But I bet it fails miserably with the wrong crowd.

Commonly described as the game of life for adults, the gameplay isn't that much better and the rulebook is a convoluted mess. However the stories that emerge from the gameplay along with the card illustrations are just so damn funny, that you can still have a pretty decent time bringing this to the table.

This game was a lot harder than I thought.  It's not so easy to focus on your 5 Life Aim cards while paying attention to what everyone else is doing.  This game definitely needs the full 5 or 6 to make it really fun.  Playing the German version is another bonus because it's fun trying to figure out what each card means.

Casual game with friends. Kind of like The Game of Life, but you actually get to make decisions, and end up having affairs with each other and doing drugs and having a good laugh at the stories that result. The telephone rules aren't so fiddly once you check out some of the player aids in the files section. Good for a social group looking for laughs.

I absolutely love this game. It is funny and a blast to play. My only gripe with the game is that it takes quite a few plays to get used to all the rules and it can be difficult to try and teach to people. If not for these reasons I would of given this game a 10. At game end looking back and seeing how your life went is just hilarious. Where else can you get a chance to sleep with your friends wife and get away with it lmao. If you have the patience to get thru the rules and play a few practice games to get a feel for it. I HIGHLY recommend this game.

One of the funniest games I have played.  Haven't laughed so much in quite a while.  A bit group-dependent, best with mixed genders I think, excellent change of pace.

I like the theme and humor to the game, but I question the replay value.  It dragged a bit with 6 players which didn't help things, and while the theme was amusing, the underlying game was pretty dull.  It's funny to see how lives progress, but I may only need to live this gaming experience once.

What a pleasant surprise; while I was expecting a fun game, I didn’t expect a good game. This has more depth than it looks like and you have to line up a series of events or decisions to fulfill your goals. There is a mild form of interaction and you can also get the actions from your opponents which require you to stay alert through the game. I really dig the theme, which is unique and excellently executed. Not a game I would expect or like to play that often, but I think I will have a blast every time I do.

RATING: N/A
If you have a taste for off-color/sick humor, definitely go out of your way to play Funny Friends at least once. The cards are laugh-out-loud funny--in fact, "Check into Looney Bin" may be my single favorite game card illustration of all time. The twists and turns of one's life story and the interactions with the other players' characters can be very amusing as well. In terms of mechanisms, it's basically a German-style gamer's middleweight game, and as such it's okay--nothing special, but not bad either, and it's certainly leaps and bounds better than any other humorous game I've played. There's a fair amount of luck involved, but, really, who cares? The only rough edge was that there was some confusion as to when you could and couldn't use the cell phones, but we muddled through. As a parting shot I'll say that one might make the case that the game takes a too-lighthearted attitude towards substance abuse, but, then again, the "Totally Wasted" card is very disturbing.

RATING: 6.5
2006 acquisition. Only played a couple 2-player games and I can imagine that with more people the game could be more interactive and fun and so the score is very provisional.

I found that with 2-players, the bidding mechanic for the life card doesn't work very well.  Interaction, as already mentioned,is quite limited with only 2 players.  Nonetheless, the theme alone warrants future plays.

Perfect for the right group of people.  It's somewhat light, though there's strategy underneath the fun theme.  Have sex with the person across the table so you can dump them the next turn just so you can chalk up another ex, or just eat that cake so you can get that liposuction when it shows up.  The rules aren't great, but the gameplay is solid.

I expected this game to be all about the theme, but the mechanics underneath it are quite fun, too.  It still has some problems with balance in the life goals you must achieve to win -- some are much harder than others -- but overall it plays well.  Best with people who are willing to get into the spirit of the thing.  Indeed, this game has the advantage of being fun to listen in on even while you're playing something else.

Fun game that needs to be played when everyone is ready for a laugh. The art is great as usual for a 2F-Spiele game and the theme is silly-fun. Haven't played the English version yet but look forward to seeing what they did with some of the more un-PC elements.

A wonderful party game that lets you create and live a life with all the depth and texture of the [i]Titanic[/i]'s debris field.  Watch out who you pal-up with, though—some "friends" want to take you on a magic carpet ride or trade you back and forth like wood for sheep.  Not for those with fragile dispositions or weak livers; but for those looking to live La Vida Gide (if only for an evening), your quest ends here.

As a game, FFFF is pretty blase and leaves a lot to be desired.  As an experience, however, FFFF is unmatched.  Looking over the shape of the life you create for your virtual self is half the fun and there are so many moments of humor and oddity, that the game shines as a social simulation.  Forget about trying to be a strategic mastermind and have fun with this one, you'll enjoy it a lot more.  Very original.

I'm not a fan of party games, and have been in need of a solid, clever board game that fulfills the duties of a party-game, without being lame like "Apples to Apples".

Funny Friends is great for a large friendly group, IF you can get people to get the concepts down.  The game is good for a lot of laughs, and a generally good time, but it can be tricky to teach.  My advice is to know the rules inside and out before teaching it to a group.  You don't want to lose people while you're tearing through the rules trying to figure out how the cell phones are supposed to work.

Need to play once more, but I suspect this one will get traded away.  It could be really fun to play with people that you know well.  The basic mechanics are auctions and skill track improvement, with hidden goals.  Don't play with people who like all information to be public.  I am not sure how much skill is involved in this game.  You get dealt some goals at the beginning, and you try to win cards at auction that allow you to achieve those goals.  Maybe it would be more fun if you instead looked at twice as many goals and chose the ones you wanted to pursue?  I am going to look into variations that people have played.

The theme is fun, but the game mechanics betray it quite a bit.  I find it most frustrating when I have three goals that require a certain track to be advanced, and there are no cards available that advance that track.  Rules for cellphone use are needlessly complicated.

This is a game I play every few months because of the theme and then immediately regret afterwards.  Like so many of the events in the game.

The toning-down of the English version has to be mentioned, because what this game has going for it more than anything else is its theme, and the edits hack the theme to pieces.  The times I've really enjoyed this game were plays with a pasted-up German version.

We finally got to play this game at the Club and I think it was the most 'fun' we have had playing ANY game in a long, long time.  Some of the guys wanted to play female characters, but still used their own names in table talk.  I think that the rest of the room was having as much fun listening to us as we had playing.

There is really nothing too special about the game... it is resource management to the max.   Planning which cards you want to buy to reach your goals and how much 'time' you use to do it can be a careful balancing act.

However, planning too far ahead is virtually impossible because of the auctions, especially if you ended a round with only four or five time markers.  Getting a card cheaply (in a six player game) isn't that easy.  Passing early is usually not an option if there are still cards on the table that help you towards your goals.

Our first game, at least, was very close, and the winner had a great 'come from behind' victory... firing off three goals in succession in the last round.

I should probably rate this a 7, but I bumped it up a level just for the 'fun factor.'  Highly recommended.

I didn't really like this game that much.  The rules are not written very well.   The point is to become the worst person you can possibly be with the worst habits.  I don't even really know how you win the game.  Only played once though, but even though the cards are amusing this game could get dull extremly fast. *****UPDATE**** moved my rating from 5 to 6 after second play still not that great of a game it does have the "collect goods to build" mechanic which I love, just don't care for the theme to much.  This is the type of game that is funny once but after you see the cards it is just kind of blah.

Fantastically Fun (get it?) idea that is marred a bit by the usual poorly written and unstreamlined rule set that plagues FF's games. However, this one has enough fun and creativity to overcome the quirk, for me. I'm not sure it will have enough variability for me to bring it out with the same crowd again and again, but I plan to use this game with those ready to move on from basic family games to something a little more involved and different. The great theme will carry them onward in gaming with more curiosity, I'm sure. After the initial work of ingesting how the tracks and auctions work, it's pretty straightforward to play.

The idea of "Fiese Freunde Fette Feten" is quite similar to Chez Geek. The game is fun for a few times, in other words: it has replayability issues. The difficulty level of each player's mission in life can vary a lot. With some cards one just can't win. Anyway it is a relaxing funny game when it is not played often.

Funny Friends is more of an experience than a game. The winner will be decided more by the inital target card distribution than players' actions but that's not what the game is about. It shines as a comical life simulation with friends. Having one or two couples in the mix helps a lot. 
Want to have inconsequential sex with complete strangers, get acquainted with other women while your girlfriend sits next to you, seeing your partner getting divorced from you smiling fiendishly? Not to forget the goals you reach in your life and the way there: party excesses, rural club visits, church groups to become Anonymous Alcoholic, Nun or ending in psychical clinic. This is the game. Great fun every 6-12 months with the right group and some intoxication. Nothing to play again next week with your boardgame group.

Very weird game. I suspect that its probably better played with 5 or 6 players. There just doesn't seem to be that much interaction otherwise. The rules were poorly written, and because all the cards used symbols, it was sometimes hard to interpret the meanings. 

The theme and artwork is certainly very unique, but I'm not sure how replayable this game is.

[LUP 20-Jul-2007] Doug had ended up with two copies of this so I we acquired it along with some second hand items from him today.  Played it tonight with three newbies.

Rated after one play, but I don't see how repeated plays would reveal anything new. While the game is funny and certainly one-of-a-kind, it just bored me to death. Players spend a good portion of time analyzing the life cards to see what, if any, are of any use to them. There shouldn't be this much A.P. in a game where there is so much luck in the life cards. Like Sid Sackson's Bazaar, you're making calculations between your current status and the cards at your disposal in order to best achieve your goals. That's all well and good. But when I have to sit out a round (5-10 mins), or two even, because all of the face-up cards are virtually useless to me, I've completely lost interest. I have no interest in ever playing this game again. [b]3[/b]

great graphics, funny version of spiel des lebens. i always mix up the rules and the icons but love to play it anyway. most fun of all is to "recall" your life after the end of the game by reading the cards you chose during the game in correct order (which means you have to collect and not discard them).

Some might find the theme offensive, but in a game it's OK. I also tought on making a game where you could have sex ( but with no drugs ). I did not liked most of the mechanics of the game but the most obvious flaws are the component's design. 

First, the various aspect of your character could have been placed in order instead since each attribute which is maxed out cancels another one. Second, for the relationships, instead that everybody has tokens of everybody on their chart. They should have made a square chart with all the characters on the top and on the side. Then place relations tokens that you place on the intersection of both characters.

Finally, the US version is censored, WTF!!? I was totally surprised that the americans could not witstand simple tits in the artwork. One of my friend even said that in "princes of renaissance", the classic painting where you could see a women's breast was modified. Come on! it's artwork not pornography.

RATING: 7
One of the funniest and more disturbing (in a good way) themes I've run across.  A very innovative game idea executed really well.  This is high on Experiential Games b/c of the theme and party game flavor.  At the heart, it has card-collecting & bidding strategies involved.  It's a blast to play now and again with the right crowd...

Funny, Funky, Fiddly, Fiese Freunde Fette Feten!

It's the first Friedemann Friese game I've ever played. At its heart is a funky mechanic that fits the theme quite well. The parameters of life and temptation guide your steps as you unroll your - very disturbed - existence and suffer the consequences of your acts. The rules may be confusing at first, especially the part about interacting with other players, but everything flows quite well once you're in play. It is however much easier to be guided in the game by someone who already knows it well.

It's a game that will generate lots of laughter around the table as long as you make sure to play with the right group and with a localized version because most of the fun comes from being able to understand the cards. Also it's best played with 4   as downtime quickly becomes a problem with more players.

It's a different game, not really a party game but a game to play and laugh a lot while doing it. there are really weird thing happening everytime we play it.

I enjoy this one. The Friendship Offer (telephone) marker rules are Bizarre! Once you get these down the game works well, and smoothly. But the pain and scarring of deciphering the Offer marker rules is visible, and not pretty.

There are a couple other rules that are not clear in the English version. The cards, however, are just fine (we like Doris Day and The Rock!).

It's Sims the board game, and it's loads of fun. I just wish the rules were better written.

Update: After several more plays the seeming depth just isn't there. The call tokens are a joke, and seem almost meaningless. The game also overstays it's welcome, then ends so abruptly the best thing that can be said is "what should we play next".

It's about what I expected it to be. A boardgame with something of a roleplaying game feel although your "character" is kind of scripted in that you are trying to complete goals given to you, you do get choices in how you can interact with the other players and nuetral characters.

CV takes this concept and makes it much more accessible.

The rules about who you can take along to an event (and when people get taken along) are a little tricky until they've been explained, but the rest of the game is simple to understand.

Sadly, things seem to be over a little too soon, but that's much better than a game overstaying its welcome.

Unintersting gameplay, luck based, fiddly, too long; the only appeal (for someone) is the theme (that's also an automatic "I decline" for someone else), but the (supposed) humor isn't supported by the poor artwork and the language dependency.

Party game that is based on euro game principles. When the rules are well understood by everyone (not very clear on paper) then you can start enjoying the high amount of interaction and funny cards that you find in this game. 

If you have a group of people that like to socialize, have fun and laugh a lot, this is the game for you, despite the large degree of seriousness in the game.

First game was a lot of fun and laughter, even though we played only a similar game to the one the designers intended - this is more or less inevitable due to the shoddy rulebook.

I did like this game, however right mood is certainly needed for it. 

This is a fun party game. It can be a little bit complicated in its mechanics for what is at its core an auction game. The game seemed a little long at times.

The artwork is top notch and the humor makes this game. (if them make a US version that is cleaned up it would ruin this one) 

I worry that once the jokes in this game get old that it will lost a good bit of its fun, but if you want something thats fun for a big group of maybe not so serious gamers then this is a good choice.

I'm a little concerned this will get stale quickly.  The theme is great, but it needs more life goals and mega goals.  The friend rules need to be clearer.

RATING: 7
In fact, there is not a good game behind the theme. Cards are unbalanced, auctioning is without tension.

However, this game is unique. It is full of humour, satire, and sex. Where else could you experience all those mean lives? I think it is a game for experience, not for win.

I think the very flaw of this game(and other games of Friedmann) is, that Friese want it to be a game of experience AND AT THE SAME TIME a euro-style game which requires well-designed logical and arithmatical system. Friedmann is good at the former, but not so good(if not bad) at the latter.

This is an "experience" game, much like Betrayal at House on the Hill, not something worth pursuing if you are expecting longevity.

Underneath the skin, Funny Friends is a basic auction game where you try to fill your life goals by having certain stats to fulfill.  You do this by acquiring "life cards" that will give you effects that impact your stats.  Many of these life cards require certain prerequisites before even bidding on them thus introducing a puzzle-like aspect to the game.  The "meta" of the game is trying to figure out the fastest path to hit your five required life goals  by navigating through these cards

On paper, it sounds an interesting game but what makes it fall apart is the decision-making is too simple to be taken seriously.  Most of the choices and cards you need are very obvious thus the gameplay feels like you are going through the motions until the game ends.  It doesn't help that the rulebook makes learning the game a difficult challenge since the text layout is awful with barely any pictorial examples.  Even after a few games, I still have no idea how the "cellphone" works in this game.

It's rather unfortunate because I love the theme of this game.  Unlike most other "alter ego" games, like Pursuit of Happiness and CV, Funny Friends embraces the vices and misfortunes in life with open arms instead of idealistic utopia nonsense.  Traits and experiences like Teen Pregnancy, anonymous sex, being a chain smoker, and joining a cult are all possible avenues you can take for your alter-ego.

I doubt this game will get a reprint.  If it did, it requires a rules overhaul to make the game have some meat.  I wish more alterego games would be as open to the good and bad things in life as much as Funny Friends.

Update: Played this again recently; this is a much better game than people give it credit for. Having someone good at explaining the rules is a big bonus, but there is only one or two real pitfalls about how you get to know the players in the game and who can force their way into which type of events. Fun (in the best sense of the word). Bumped rating to 8.

To call the illustrations (and there are many!) marvellous would not do them justice. The game itself is prone to be played 'wrongly', though. (Wrong group, wrong mood, wrong style of play ...) Rules are a mite unclear, but most points are clarified on Marcel-André's website.

Played once, German version, and enjoyed the theme and the artwork. The theme works well, except for the rather odd competition for activities. Why can´t I join a church or have sex with a friend just because player B is doing the same this week? I enjoyed the first hour of gameplay, but the game lasted too long and the randomness became too much. I had one full turn where I was the starting player and could do nothing with the cards that came out. I had to pass and sit out a full turn while the other four players were doing the auctions and playing goals. That´s just bad design. I haven´t played Chez Geek for a long time, but I think I prefer it to this game. My Story shows a lot of promise but does not come with the sex, drugs and rock´n´roll.

A strange little game for which (not unusual for 2-F-Spiele) the rules are vague in some places and incomprehensible in others. I think Friese has a deserved reputation for some games, whilst others are phoned in. This seems like one of the latter. Feels like one of those TV sit-coms where the producers don't understand and have misjudged their target market, and the whole thing has a slightly painful edge. Whilst I like the premise of this one, it could have done with a deal more play-testing and a deal more subtlety. Funny Friends - the joke's a bit thin and it's a little bit funless. Go Figure.

Fun with a few houserules. The interesting stories and funny scenarios are what make this game an experience.

Our houserules:
Life goals: Drafting variant, 1 goal must stay face up always.

Last to pass gets 0 time, 2nd last (1 time), 3rd last (2 time), and so on...

Puberty: Lay out 3 cards per player, just a single phase.

Real life: 1 card per player - alternate between A and B deck. Time auction before each phase - blind bid. All lost bids must pay as well. 

Telephones: anyone can use a telephone to force a friend to bring them on an event. Afterwards, someone can also use a phone... the last phone call gets to go along.

I almost gave this game a 10 solely on the strength of its theme, which I felt was very strong, offbeat and just plain cool. However the mechanics are so-so and don't really gel with the theme all that great; and I'm concerned that replay value won't be as great after 3-4 games; some of those jokes will probably get old fairly fast. But the THEME! It's awesome. I'd write an ode to FF if I could.

RATING: 6.5
A hip party game with a wonderful theme (neo-conservatives need to apply).  I would recommend the German version with paste-ups (thanks Morgan!) over the PC-fied English version as half of the fun is in the ridiculously funny & taboo pictures.  The game has strong set collection and auction mechanics but it's not one to take too serious.  In fact there's a bit of luck in the goal cards one receives as some allign well with others.  It's really all about role-playing: who you're having sex with, whether you're having a mid-life crisis, trying to quit a dirty habit, etc.  Another inventive design by the 2F team.  UPDATE: moved my rating down a point.  Although it's really an interaction party-style game it's just a little too long (by 30-60 minutes) for the payoff.

RATING: 8.5
Tons of fun, and quite a surprising amount of game there. The different elements are meticulously interwoven, and while it seems like there's a lot of detail (there are in fact tons of bits) it all makes sense even by the end of the first game, and there are significant decisions to be made. Brilliant. Also features THE BEST CARD IN A GAME EVAR, "Red Sox Defeat Yankees 4 games to 3".

I really liked the theme and design (look) of the game. The theme had everyone laughing the entire game. However i felt a lot was based on the chance of the cards on display. Also there was alot of down time in between turns. These two complaints might be fixed upon replaying since then it would move faster since we knew how to play the game.

RATING: 5
I've only played this once, so I really shouldn't rate it yet, but I'm doing so anyway.  I bought this game almost entirely thanks to its "funny factor".  Unfortunately, thanks to a fairly lengthy rulebook, along with many instances of consulting said rulebook, the game bogged down into a more than three hour marathon.  The humor was almost completely lost.  It will be tough to play this one again since the other three regulars of our couple's gaming group have no desire to do so.

Oh well... back to the drawing board.

I am not completely sure about this game yet. It is good fun because of the funny cards, but at least with two players I don't feel there is too much strategic choice.

The game is pretty funny, but the criticisms are spot on.  This has the makings of an incredible party game, but it's saddled with some fairly gamey (or at the very least unintuitive) mechanics which, though very playable and interesting, prevent this from ever appealing to a very wide audience.  A once a month experience game.

Bit of a grail game for me -- just from reading reviews and rules. I had a great time on my first play -- it's definitely a game that you play with your best, non-Aspy gaming friends. There's a great deal of cleverness in the cards, especially in the interpretation to real life situations, and I'm a fan of any game that can pull off the strategy-party dynamic (VivaJava, to a certain extent Sherwood Forest), which Funny Friends does very well. My concerns are that it can drag a bit with 6 people, the rules around friends/partners can be difficult to convey, and it may suffer from replayability since there are so few puberty and life goal cards to go around.

Saw this being played at WBC. Didn't get to watch enough to really understand the mechanics, but it looks like you're playing a person trying to pick up bad habits. Looked pretty odd. After my first play it looks like this is something that might have similar draw as munchkin. The jokes will likely become old after a while, but I'm not sure the mechanics make the game something that will last after multiple plays.

This is a difficult one to rate. You absolutely must go into it with a sense of humour or it would be horrible. More of an experience of developing somewhat humourous narratives than a serious test of wits.

The game is really nice, a long enough beer&pretzel game but with a deep theme. Even if luck plays a strong role, you always feel to be in control of your life. Cards are really funny and, you do not get used to them (as it happened with Munchkin after some sessions).

I can't help but think that your result is largely determined by being lucky enough to have goal cards with symbols that match and are different to the other players. And it's expensive and tempo consuming to discard and draw new cards in hope. The game play itself isn't that engaging, continually scanning cards for symbols that will help, then either choosing or auctioning them off. The theme lends itself to good fun around the table which is a partial offset. Summary: merely ok.

The box says this takes 60 minutes.  If it took that long I would probably really like it.  As it is, a 6 player game took 2.5 hours & it lost it for me after 60 minutes. But it was really fun for the initial part.

I dunno, maybe another play with 4 players would be good. Maybe 6 is just too many.

Rating after one play at Essen 2005! This game is somewhat ambiguos to me. At first the game mechanism itself dosn't fit to much my personal taste. It feels to light to be much fun. Second, there are too many gaming components that make this game even fiddly. But somehow the cards save the game. The pictures on it are so much fun and the story of ones life is so much fun AFTER finishing the game that I almost bought it just because of this aspect. A friend of mine bought it, so I will play it more and maybe will alter my opinion in the future.

Upon a second, correct play, the game is much better. The theme is great and the cards are funny, which add a lot to the game. You basically go through life trying to attain goals (which are based on your players characteristics). You do this by taking part is life events, often with others in the game. There is some strategy, but mostly just silly fun.

Gioco originalissimo, politicamente scorretto e graficamente eccellente. Carine le meccaniche di gioco e gli obiettivi che vanno "incastrati" per cercare di vincere (meglio fondar prima una setta o diventare un filosofo?). L'unica difficoltà è raccapezzarsi con le carte "mute", ma il disorientamento passa una volta finita la fase della pubertà (c'è qualcosa di realistico, no?). A mio parere, difficile ostacolare l'avversario se non sei bravino. Essendo un gioco "particolare" per le tematiche trattate, il divertimento è dipendente dalla "qualità" degli avversari: ho in mente un paio di amici che renderebbero sovrumana l'esperienza di gioco.

Can be a quite fun experience as the relationship carousell starts spinning faster and faster. The game can unfortunately bog down as some players get stuck in AP. The rules for relationships are somewhat confusing. Not sure about replay value though.

The realtionship rules are a chore though.

Aside from having the benefit of being able to yell about sleeping with your fellow gamers and not be insulting, this game has a decent amount of strategy to it.  The cell phones are vital, and the auctions, though simple, can be agonizing, especially since the cards one needs may only make sporadic appearances.  It fills an odd niche: either the goofy gamer's game or the gamer's party game.  The problem with cards not appearing (or appearing too perfectly for others) is a bit frustrating, especially as the replacement goal cards are too few.

Ominous occurrence: one game ended incredibly quickly, barely after the first round.

Whim purchase.. We'll see.

Slated for a game tonight.. I'm not sure WHO I'll play this with.. there's alot of sex and things going around.  The metaphysical ramifications are weird.  AKA, don't play this with your heavily religious mother.

Update:  We started to play it, but we got stuck in a quagmire of rules.  The game shows promise, but players have to wade through rules to bring the game together.  What appears to be happening is that the game attempts to be simple, but in doing so, undermines the true complex nature of the game and therefore makes it difficult to play intuitively.  I'd like to play some more, throughly understand the rules, and play with like minded individuals (to reduce learning curves) next time. 

Update: Finally got a game in - 2 players.  Had to work out the rules and we avoided having each other as friends (as its easier to avoid the extra confusion there).  It's really quite fun, somewhat realistic, and definitely crass.  Not recommended for individuals who are easily offended - definitely want to make sure you know your group well before you play with them (aka force them to have same-gender sex with you).  Would definitely be more fun with a group larger than 2 - probably 4 .  My rating represents my desire to play it again.

Update:  Increasing the rating.. Great game to play with more than 2 people, but always remember that you ought to know who you're playing this game with.  Lots of fun, for sure.  I'm promoting it more often these days.

The story that is created during this game is fun. However, the game itself is extremely inbalanced. Certain (combinations of) goals are far more difficult to obtain and/or far more easily interfered with by the other players.
In addition, if certain attribute that you need is scarce, you are not only forced to wait until it finally appears, but when it appears, you need to pay a lot for it since it is scarce...

RATING: 7
Tentatively brought it to the table of casual gamers (and my wife...eek) and with some relief the session raised a few laughs, especially with one player piling on numerous sex counters on poor Peggy (not my wife's name). I guess future playings would diminish the humour, which is fine as the thoughtfilled design will sustain the playing (which rulewise is relatively simple, but sequencing of card play to match your profile is abit heady). I strongly suspect the sweetspot will be three players for two reasons: you are more likely be able to overcome bad card draws; and the auction phase can be long and painful for those whose cards don't match those on offer. Also because the cards are detailed, divining the life goals of your opponent will be difficult without future playings (which won't be the case for me as coffee was spilt on it in the second session). It was refreshingly different from the standard Euro fare with the exciting, enjoyable feature of first going out (or in my case "coming out") wins.

RATING: 3
Too little decision making and too much luck to be a serious game, and too fiddley, long, and too many rules to be a party game. I don't buy the "gamer's party game" designation either. But it oozes with theme. Overall I did not enjoy this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Friese seems to have forcibly grafted Euro mechanics onto a party game with this one and the result is ugly. You bid for cards but you have no way of knowing which cards are valuable to your opponents. The auction seems entirely unnecessary as a result, since this is really an exercise in optimizing a decision path. What's more, the "friend" rules are needlessly overcomplicated and the rulebook tremendously bad. I STILL don't fully understand and could not explain to you how the different friend scenarios should be resolved, even after downloading player aids from BGG.

On the plus side: The art is great and the cards make you chuckle. This is actually FUN to play with the right people. It's just not a great GAME.

Unlike many of my other gaming friends, I do not think this game is hilarious at all. So you're all having sex and taking drugs (you wish!) - What is so funny about that ? It's like being stuck in a loop of Southpark reruns, not funny once you think about it. The game is not bad but very luck based, what cards come up and what cards are in your hand. There is some planning etc. but not enough to make this worthwhile in my opinion.

After one play. Huge luck factor with the goal cards.

Auctions don't feel competitive because players are either flush with money, almost broke, or unable to even bid because of other bid requirements. Worse, players' goals are so diverse that you simply don't want what everyone else wants.

That said, because auctions aren't tense or hotly contested, this *should* be a quick game because auctions should be quick. However, there are so many characteristics to keep track of, which slows down the game considerably with non-experienced players.

The game itself isn't very innovative: Pick a card to auction. Repeat until no one wants any of the cards available that round. Extra money if you decide to stop auctioning off cards in a round early.

The unapologetically offensive theme is its only redeeming feature.

RATING: 7
If it is played with the right kind of crowd and in the right mood it can be really funny. But from time to time it happens that you cannot make use of any of the cards, so you might be "out" of the game for quite some time. I am also not so sure about the long time motivation to play this game since the funny graphics and  situations will wear off with repeated play.

RATING: 7
Terrfic theme and sensational adult-underground comic art. Perhaps the best I've seen in a euro game. Keep all the cards and you've got your character's life story to read out in the end. It's almost like story telling: drunken frat parties, indiscriminate sex, hippy communes and smoker's cough - does someone know my life story? Mechanics are run-of-the-mill card drafting that can drag. But how about that THEME?!Looking forward to English version as German rules are strained and the cards get lost in translation. Also feel the author/s was somehow traumatised by religion when younger...hence the poor old church gets a generally rough deal.

This is an activity -- an honestly funny thing to do with a table of friends -- not a game. If you go into it with that mindset, you will enjoy it every few months, especially if you have new members in your gaming group. If you go in expecting a game, the winning player will be whoever got easier / more synergistic goal cards at the beginning of the game.

RATING: 6
Interesting theme that must be taken light-heartedly to have fun.  As each game needs 5 males and 5 female characters, would strongly suggest that more player characters be of mixed gender to avoid having the non-player characters all be a single gender.  The first game might drag as players read all the cards, but should speed up with familiarity.  But still a lot of down time between turns - suspect 4 (perhaps 5) might be a good number for this game.  And certainly quick players.

Will you like this game?

Go into your kitchen, and return to the computer with a loaf of bread.

If the bread is white and presliced, this ain't the game for you.

...

The English changes were annoying, so I bought a German copy to paste up. In the end I didn't bother pasting it, as the cards are pretty self explanatory.

It's a very clever, well-designed game -- it's not a joke cardgame as you might think. Reminds me a bit of Amun-Re for some reason. It's probably best with a mixed group of four players.

I am not kidding when I say that every game is better or worse depending on who you play with. Any how, this game was great times when I played it twice in a day with my weird friends.

But I don't think I can play this with a serious gamer who cares more about game mechanisms than themes.

After my first play I would have probably rated this a 6 or 6.5. I think playing a game for the first time with 6 people is probably a bad idea in general if you dislike length. At any rate, the first play was still enjoyable for me. I enjoy the "person simulator" aspect, and knocking up your friends girlfriend(who happens to be the guy sitting next to you) is always fun, but it was really too long for what it was.

On my second play, with 4, I think the game was considerably better. The rounds went much faster, there was not as much bickering about card meanings, and it was generally just more fun.

I definitely think if this game is being played with serious gamers the "Rules for control freaks" should be used. It employs a card passing method of seeding goals such that you will get at least 3/5 goals along the same general victory path, reducing the already large amount of luck in the game. Also, with less players the 'pay 4 time to draw new goals' action became MUCH more viable, allowing for much more flexibility, and not so much "Oh a card with a smoking effect didn't come out, I can now not win."

[3 plays] 6 players and 4 players. We've had a good time with this game. It helps if everyone is in the right mood to enjoy the humor of the theme and artwork. I'm not convinced how strategic this game can be, or how balanced the goals are. I do think it is more controllable from a gameplay standpoint with fewer than 6 players. There are tighter interactions and less downtime. The third play has somewhat convinced me that this is kind of a party game disguised as a strategy game, without a large amount of staying power once the novelties wear off.

Most recent play 4-7-07 with Barb, Mindy, and Garrett.

RATING: 5.5
An oddly themed game about managing aspects of your life (weight, sex, relationships, vices, etc) in order to be the first to achieve 5 life goals. Sure, it sounds like fun, in reality, the game is layered upon actions: people bid for cards that will boost or decrease their stats. It's all about goal and card management.

What lets the game down is the disconnect between the auctions and actual life goals (so what if they call the currency time tokens?!). The bits are extremely tiny and fiddly. Why couldn't they have made the tokens and player board larger?

Art is not bad and suits the FF themed game. Not his best work.

I haven't laughed this hard in a game in a long, long time.

Certainly, it is a party game of sorts, but it is a party game with a real game underneath.  I fear that with 6 people the downtime may be a little overwhelming.  I suspect that 5 is about right.  

I love the way the effects of players interact.  Forcing bids for people to effect you how you'd like is quite satisfying.

The big drawback of the game is that you may never get the oportunity to fulfil your goals.  If you want to get fat and there are no cards to aid you getting fat, you have no options.  But, it is a card game after all, so what can you expect. Perhaps changing your goals is too expensive, and people would feel like they blew the entire round if they took the option.

The phone chits are so much more important that I'd suspected at first.  I feel though that you should be able to use them on x to say that x must hook up with y even if you are z.  If not sometime it is impossible to get out of relationships.  Regardless, this is a blast.

RATING: 7
German language version.

Very adult, darkly humorous game.  I was continually shocked into laughter by the artwork on the cards, especially as my German friends translated the text.  I've played once, so I can't speak to replay value, but I think it was worth lugging it back from Germany for the one play, which lasted 3 hrs. but was accompanied by many, many laughs.  

Each player has a board with various lifestyle effects and places to put character tokens in various stages of relationship with that player (simply friends, engaged, separated, etc).  Cards are placed in the play area face up that are auctioned off.  Most cards have requirements (the player bidding must have 2 friends and has been a drinker at some point, for example) and effects (the player and any friends on the card have sex and do drugs together, for example!).  Each player also has five hidden Life Aims, which correspond to having a certain profile on their player board (e.g. two smoking points, a money point, and four friends).  Anytime a player can match the profile on one of their Life Aims cards, they can play that card face up in front of them.  The first player to fulfill five Life Aims immediately wins.

Just bought my own copy and need to learn more about the game. This is a great little euro based party game in which you try to live up to a prescribed set of values for an alternative lifestyle. Your cards may say that you are not allowed to get married, or that you have a heroin addiction, or even that you are a priest. Either way, this is a lot of fun for a more adult group. This is not a sex game, just raunchy fun.

Experience game that has some good ideas and more than its share of problems.  Some pros are that it has great art, fun mechanics with the bidding system, and the objectives are cool.  On the other hand, it is way too long, the phone-a-friend system is basically broken, and rules are terribly written.  I might try it again with a house rule that you can only make a friend come along once (or go with a friend once), and see how that works, but being able to make someone come every time leads to the game taking forever, with nothing but chaos.  It really doesn't make any sense.

[Fiese Freunde Fette Feten 05 Edition] {Beer&Pretzels, life; drafting, auction, secret-goal; optimal 5-6p} FFFF has an original theme about life development. The theme is fascinating. The rulebook is incoherent and is loosely presented.  I felt bewildered when reading it. Therefore, one has to read it carefully and thoroughly to get everything correct. The clarification questions in the BGG forum are useful too.

The graphics are cute but not suitable for children. The cards are quite true to a life.  I don't find the cards offending. Actually, I think they are ludicrous. The German text isn't a problem but it would be funnier if English translations are provided.

There is no particular strategy in this game; like your life, participate in more activities and know more friends, you will be better off. In addition, I don't think the control freak variant, though it would be more thematic if players can choose their personal goals.

I bought the German edition because I expect the cards will be more fun.  However, it seems that there are no major differences between English and German edition.

Underneath the sex, drugs, and blasphemy, this is a really solid auctioning game.  However, the aforementioned 'naughty' nature really makes it a fun game for groups of 5-6 in particular, and serves as a good way to introduce people to a meatier game while keeping the level of enjoyability high.  There are some really incredibly well-thought mechanics here (particularly the cell phones, and the "Hit level 4 in one stat, lose all of another stat").  Even when you've seen the cards a bunch, the humor stays fresh for quite awhile (unlike the "Only funny once or twice" effect that tends to be the case in a lot of humor-based games), and there's nothing quite like getting your friend pregnant, breaking up with them, then getting back together just long enough to give them an STD and break up with them again.  The cell phone mechanics are hard for new people to grasp at first, but once that's down, it's a really smooth, enjoyable game.

Edit after many plays: I would like this game a lot more if I wasn't the only one to firmly grasp the friends and cell phone rules.  As it is I have to re-teach and/or provide two dozen rules clarifications per game, and it gets tiring.

I thought this would be really interesting and fun,  it turned out to be fiddly and boring. Thank goodness FF picked this theme, for if it were not relatable and funny, it would have been terrible dull.

Also AP will totally suck the life out of this game, if you sit down with a group of slow players, quit and pick another game as this one will infuriate you.

We laughed a lot. We had loads of fun. Then why do I rate this game so low (5.5)?

Because, when you take away the theme (which is, to make this clear, just hilarious), then a slightly boring card game remains, that has unnecessarily complex rules and where a playes has a lot lesser influence on what's happening then I like in games. 
And I fear that the fun rapidly dimishes once you've seen all or most of the really good and very funny images/cards. 

I'd wish for a lot more different targets in life.

RATING: 5.5
"Funny" game. More of a party game than a strategic game, although it can be played as such. The main problem I have with the game is that you can force other players to join you in a relationship or have sex or a kid with them, with nearly no way to stop them, which can majorly screw up some of the life goal requirements.

Besides that it is an average game in every sense of the word. The only reason I'd consider it SLIGHTLY above average is because by the end of the game you do end with some funny stories about what your characters life was like, but that's about it. Would probably be more fun when playing with females and people who don't over analyize the game.

Played 10+ times. Well that's a blast.  The theme is great and the cards are quite funny.  I would definitely say it's a party game with a game under the hood.

It's just so much fun to be able to be drunk and debauturous and sleep with your friends. 2006/04/18

Finally got a chance to play this, its a riot!  Very easy to learn but also has very fiddly components for a cardgame.  I love the art, some of it and the cards are very humorous.  I would easily consider this a gamers party game, its kind of like if you took Chez Geek and put a game behind it.  Theres bidding, interaction and comedy gold in the box.  One thing I noticed is that right after playing I felt that the game NEEDS an expansion!  Some new mega goals, new characters and perhaps a career aspect that uses up time but rewards you other ways.  Depending on the comedy value I fear that its appeal might diminish over more plays but there's enough game that the rating may go up or down over time, It's a fence sitter.

Interesting and quite twisted take on Life itself. The theme of the game is good and so are all the actions and general system, but our game took too long because of badly written rules which lacked clear examples and rule clarifications. Not bad and not too original either, except for the theme.

The concept is great and there should be a hilarious experience game in here, but Funny Friends will bog unless you rip out the mathy auctions and the confusing phone tokens.  It becomes eminiently playable that way and much more enjoyable.  Just like life, you don't have much control in Funny Friends.  So it shouldn't be so hard to sit back and enjoy the racy artwork.

Fiddly setup, fiddly rules. Fun, not too heavy. Adult theme, of course. Needs a few plays (probably) to get where the strategy can be.

Played again and realized we missed a lot of rules. Tried to understand rules and could not get them. Read rulebook 30 minutes and made up houserules because we just could not get it. Rating went down from 7 to 5.

Funny cards looking for a game.

Better rules available for download (only in German, I think)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
High marks for originality, but the rules and length make me not want to bring it out that often.

Betrayal at House on the Hill and this game both sit in that space of maybe being more complicated to explain than it is worth to a new group of casual gamers.

They are both better once your comfortable with them, but with my limited amount of gaming time and lack of consistent group, there are always games I'd rather play.

Update: The complexity of this game outruns the depth, the rules are only adequate and necessitate lots of BGG Rules Forum lookups and it is a bit tedious to set up and put away.  

These things, plus the fact that the handling of the theme makes it unsuitable for some crowds, should kill the game for me. And it sat for the last three years (and was on my Trade list for two).

The thing is I rejected at least 5 fair trade offers for it.  The theme and gameplay are so unique that I just couldn't part with it.

Well I broke it out again yesterday and I had had a great time.  It has all of the problems I have stated, but the game is unique and fun.

My earlier comparison to Betrayal at House on the Hill is still apt, but there is an actual game here rather than the shared event that Betrayal is.  That said, nobody should be writing strategy articles for Funny Friends.  I think it should be played for the riduclous story that each persons life ends as.  And to that end I suggest keeping all of the cards you play in a chronological timeline, then go through and re-tell the story of each players life at game end.  It is quite entertaining.

Yes Funny Friends has its warts, but in the end it is fun.  I do not want to play this all of the time, but it will probably always have a place in my collection.

The rating goes up from a 6 to a 7.  I imagine it will hold there. 

Update: Ugh.  I can't figure out how I feel with this one.  I think it is highly dependent on the way the game's "story" goes.  If the story is fun, the game is fun.  If not, the game feels overlong.  Back to a 6.5 for me. I still like what it sets out to do and no other game even tries

Update: CV tried to do what FF does, but seems as though it has met with mixed reviews. I would like to try it.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 2
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 1


Overall - 1.25

Hoping this goes up.  One play, and it was the worse possible play imaginable.  Long discussions over rules, rule implication, overthinking play, and disinterest with a few players.

Cards and concept seemed amusing, but let down by hopelessly ambiguous rules (bringing friends to events / use of telephone tokens).  There's probably clarification for this somewhere now, and I guess I'd give it another go, but a lot of time wasted in confusion has soured it for me.

Rating based on one three player game.  Enjoyed the game very much.  However, the fun factor of this game is also highly dependent on the players involved.  You definitely need to have a sense of humour when playing this one.

We found the rules are fiddly and fail to explain (or we justed missed it) certain circumstances that can arise in the game.  For example, if I am married to a character, not engaged or happily married, can someone else commence a relationship or marry the same person?

All in all this is a game that has great replayability and I am looking forward to our next game.

Funny game. But the rulebook is quite poorly organized. 
I enjoy Sims the computer game. Funny Friends is actually a mimic work turning Sims to a boardgame. The game is enjoyable and I do enjoy it, particularly playing with non-geeks. Geeks are less good players to enjoy thematic games. With non-geeks in my group (as well as girls), they are immersed and make the game real fun.

Too complicated to be a party game, too random to be a gamer's game.  What does that leave?  Something pretty fun.  The humor is a big part of the attraction.  Will I still like the game if the humor wears thin?  I don't know.  I'll let you know if I find out.  In the mean time, I don't have many humourous games that aren't party or take-that games, so this is something fairly unique.

The theme is excellent for a party game, or for a light game with a mixed group.  the mechanics are strictly gamer mechanics, and the rules are distinctly heavier than they should be for the execution-  especially since when someone wins, it doesn't really feel like there was much you could do about it... which kind of pushes it back out of the "gamer's game" box.

Party game for gamers.  Guaranteed to get a few laughs when you bring it out, and there's enough meat there that you can't completely blow it off as random.  Luck plays a major role, but the auction mechanic and the timing of your plays, as well as knowing when to pass and when to use your offer tokens can make a difference.  Sure, sometimes you might get screwed with bad draws, but I'm willing to cut a bit of slack to a game like this, with great illustrations and an irreverent sense of humor.  Not a brain-burner, but still great entertainment.  The call tokens and how relationships work are ridiculously hard to understand from the rules.  When you run into difficulties, I recommend making some rulings on the fly, and then adopting them as your house rules.  It's easier and clearer that way.

This game is fun, but better to learn from someone who plays than from the rules which are a bit confusing. I'm not sure the game has long-lived play value (as does Power Grid, for example), and it probably requires the right group of friends to play with. However, if you have the right group of friends (mature, open-minded, good senses of humour), then I can see you really enjoying this game--I did, and think it will fit in with my regular gaming friends just fine.

This is a game that underage people can't play. There's sex, drugs, vices, messed up relationships, all that a LIFE game for 18 year old people should have. And its great! Awesome! The kind of turns and mechanics made in the game are a treat. I played the German version of the game, the owner said that the English version has some censured parts, I prefer the German one, and the language didn't matter in the game. Fun as hell, didn't give a ten 'cause i think it should have more players, like 8 or 10 players.

I've had a lot of fun playing FFFF, but I don't recommend playing with six. I've played twice w/6 and the game drags from the middle on; you have only one pile of goals to swap with, everyone else can gang up on you, and if you don't want any life cards on display, you'll sit quietly for a long time.

The game shines with three or four players and still works well with five. I've yet to try it with only two players.

Neat game - looks like FF is a popular designer.  Rules felt pretty much a complete mess - would be nice to get this taught by someone who knows how everything goes.  Played the marriage locking wrong (person being offered gets to choose to leave relationship),  and the cellphones completely boggle the mind.   Hilarious game though - it's definitely a game where you need to understand the cards to get a good laugh, so language is definitely an issue,  although as long as one person can explain what's going on it should be ok.   Actual game is just resource collecting to fulfill secret goals,  with auctions on random lots.  

But the theme is probably what makes the game.  Like Shadows and that game's inevitable traitor finger-pointing,   table talk is hilarious as you grab people for marriage and sex.   Not for the children.

I will admit that this game is not bad, perse. I understood it fine and can play it without much difficulty. However, I took the character parts very seriously: the game was depressing by the end, just in terms of all the negative attributes of the cards. I also had a hard time seeing my friends who were in relationships be in love/have children with other players besides their BF/GF- I know this is silly, it's just a game, but I could not distance myself from it as well as I should have. So the game itself is fine, I just don't like playing it.

This is my go-to icebreaker game. It's easy to teach, not too serious and promotes table talk. The game might be for everyone due to adult topics that are part of the game, such as sex, drug (ab)use, deperession etc. This game doesn't hit the table very often due to my 'ideal ice breaker' perception of the game. Once people know each other and/or feel comfortable with each other I often tend to introduce other games.

More of a gimmick than a real game. You'll play it once or twice and have a laugh at all the whimsical cards and events. As a game, it's just so-so. The continuous auctioning of cards drag it out slightly too long, and that's made worse by the various goal cards which often contradict eachother, making it hard to fulfill those last few. I wonder if the game wouldn't work better with a mechanic where you just pick your card, instead of auctioning them. All in all, something you should play once, just to see what it's all about, but not something you need to own.

RATING: 6
I like the life goal fulfillment, as well as the various characteristic sliders you have to account for.  However, I think the addition of the NPC friends ends up hurting the game by eliminating the necessity of player interaction.  A quirky game that feels rather novel for the first time, but I imagine would get repetitive after a couple of plays.

Funny Friends is really a game dependent on who you're playing it with.  It's a party game for gamers who are looking for a fun, not so serious time.  If you can make it past the rules (that aren't the most well-written ones in the world) and past the luck involved, you have a fun, clever game.

Once you managed to understand everything you’ve read in the rulebook, this is really an easy game to explain. Is it a fun game? Mmmm. Yes, and no… Yes, if you’re with a group of 5 or 6 people. No, if you’re with 2 or 3 players. With a small group you want to play this seriously, and the theme of the game isn’t about that. It’s about fun, fun and more fun. We liked it, but it’s nothing special.

The first time I played, the game ended on a final roll live or die... was awesome but got me thinking , yes it was nice but what about the games that won't end on a final roll. I played another 12 times and even though it not always end on a final roll some how it manage to be stressful, in a very good we survive the zombie apocalypse way, love this game .

RATING: 8
An interesting mix of euro mechanics with the tenseness and randomness of that comes with the zombie theme.  The presentation is beautiful and half the reason I bought this game in the first place, but the tight gameplay keeps me coming back.

My first Martin Wallace game hit all the right notes for me, but it's not for everyone.

RATING: 7
Simpler new Wallace design with top-notch production quality.  Seriously, this is one of the best art productions I've seen!  This aspect alone has elevated the design to higher levels.  The game is a slow road-to-ruin dice chucker, but it's not completely hopeless.  I have a feeling it will age well.

Underwhelmed. The games feels formulaic, and it felt a bit too easy to survive to California (on the first play 3 out of 4 players survived).

There is one interesting aspect which might carry some interesting meta-game : although competitive, it is useful for the players to have some minimum form of cooperation, which might lead to more subtle play.

But I don't feel interested enough by the game to explore that possibility.

A light-ish bidding game with some dice rolling/push-your-luck elements to keep things interesting. I'm personally not usually a fan of bidding games and that's mostly what this game is. However, the game plays fairly quickly and the art/theme is so fun and unique that it's worth playing the game once just to see for yourself.

Un juego que me da una sensación similar a estar viendo The Walking Dead pero sin aburrirme. La historia del juego es muy buena. tiene un nivel de dificultad aceptable y un arte muy atractivo. La mecánica de la apuesta inicial podría estar un poco más pulida pero no interfiere con el disfrute. No recomiendo abusar de este juego ya que puede volverse repetitivo, pero para una experiencia esporádica es muy buena opción.

RATING: 6.9
Very thematic components which are a pleasure in themselves to handle and look at. Lots of references to Zombie media lore. The game itself is worth a few plays. I only played solo. I lost one game in 10 so felt quite easy to get to the end of the deck of cards. However hard to get a score past 15. But after 10 plays, I don't have any inclination to go back to it. So well worth a go, but not much staying power.

"Hit Z Road" was a bit of a gamble for me to purchase, as I wasn't thrilled with the zombie theme and the title isn't my favorite, but the aesthetic pulled me in. Boy howdy am I glad I did. This is in my top 5 of 2016. In this game each player is leading a team of survivors through a zombie apocalypse, and trying to both survive and score points. Players bid, using their valuable resources, on which path they should take each round, generally opting for more resources and fewer zombies to fight. Then they go through their paths, collect resources, and fight their zombies. As you progress further in the game, the resources become more scarce, and the paths more dangerous, so the choice becomes whether to get into a bidding war with your precious resources, or try your luck with the worst paths and keep your assets tight. There are also some specialtokens that you can collect that may affect you positively or negatively later on in the game. For example, you might collect the wheel token early on, and later find a path where you can use it to create a massive zombie killing bus that helps in killing zombies, or you might find a stranger who later on might be added to your group, or betray your group depending on the path you take.

Really fun and almost every game I've played has some stand up moments where a players last survivor manages to ward off 6 zombies, only to succumb later to 3 more. Also, the game looks good. The aesthetics were crafted to look like a kid took an older game from the 50's and some decks of cards, and changed it to a zombie game. It works very well. Great game, give it a play if you have the chance!

RATING: 5
Played two-player.  Feels like a 'rich get richer' game.  Once one player has resources they can control the bidding.  And control the paths.  Meh.

RATING: 7
I thought I would never say that I liked a game by Wallace but...I enjoyed playing Hit Z Road, a simple dice game with enough of a theme (although as worn out as zombies can be) to be entertaining.

Your main concern here is to stay alive long enough to finish the game: everything else (including the three basic resources and the handful of points you pick up on the road) comes just as an extra you might benefit from in your eight-turn struggle.

Which is also what makes it playable: you take your chances and roll some dice, period. No complex strategies, no cubes to push.

Rather Meh. I don't see how the auction fits the theme at all, and that is the only interaction between players. Bad run of luck early on and you're behind in resources with little opportunity to get back as those with more bid enough to stay ahead. 

Not many decisions and fairly obvious ones. Overall did nothing for me, theme could have been anything. At least it is short ...

The game's flair is in its art and brevity. The artwork furtively depicts a story which compels interest.  Who are these people? And this kid? He creates a board game to trace his family's ordeal? ~Brilliant; evidence of the sort of imagination necessary to survive an apocalypse! And as for brevity, it only takes about five minutes to determine a winner.

Man, how far Wallace has fallen. He has churned out junk year after year for a while. This title is not breaking that downward spiral. 

For a dice game, it is lousy. There aren't interesting choices to make.  Fighting the zombies aren't that difficult. And there are so few VPs that there is no game tension. And there isn't that much fun because often you're bidding to take two cards that offer nothing.

I don't think even long term Wallace fanboyz will have anything to grasp at here.

This game shocked the hell out of me. My range of response to Martin Wallace games usually is disinterest to hate, and it takes some real work to make a game (like Automobile or Brass) that I actively hate - most bad games I would just dislike and never think of again. Anyway, enough bashing Martin Wallace - Hit Z Road is totally great. It's a pretty clean, elegant design where the game systems get out of the way and just let you play the game. It has shades of Knizia's Beowulf: the auction has some subtlety and revolves around how much risk you are going to take. The combat system is simple and clever and evocative. The narrative drive is strong. I actually love that players can be eliminated before the end, but that the game seems well-calibrated enough that if eliminations occur, it's likely to be just in the last turn or two so you aren't sitting around very long. I also love that the situation gets extremely hairy towards the end and eliminations - up to and including one player winning through everyone else dying - are fairly likely.

The zombie apocalypse thing is way past its sell-by date these days of course, but Hit Z Road is the first one I've played that makes a cool game out of it. What I (and I suspect we) are tired of is not zombies per se, but just all the lousy zombie stuff. This is actually quite good.

The gorgeous Space Cowboy's graphic design is obviously a huge help to the game also. It sacrifices usability in a couple small ways, but it's not terrible. It's been a while since I've played a game that the physical design has done such an awesome job of selling the underlying game, and the underlying game is actually good (great physical design in service of bad games is sadly not that hard to find).

I should say I haven't played many of the more American-style zombie games, primarily Dead of Winter - I'd like to try sometime, it has a good reputation even if it's unlikely to be my thing. Hit Z Road is definitely firmly in the euro camp of design economy - but that's generally a good thing.

There is still some question in my mind of replayability. If this turns out to have staying power my rating will go up to a 10.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
Most of what people like in modern euros are here : It's beautiful, the components quality is good, it's short, thematic and requires some thinking.
In the end, the gameplay is quite dry and the luck factor, which suits the story well, is too strong for me, maybe it's not that much a euro ? Enjoyable game though.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good bidding/risk management game.

The twist here is that players will be bidding resources to choose which paths (consisting of 2 card) they will encounter each round. Some paths will be great, gaining players more resources. Some will be very bad, forcing players to fight zombies, potentially losing their survivors (you lose if your survivors all die), and some will be a combination of these things, with various levels of fortune and peril.

The trick is that the resources you bid with are the same resources you'll need to more  safely negotiate your travels. So, you're not going to win every auction, or you'll run out of resources. But, if you play too conservatively with your bidding, your encounters will be pretty terrible if you're always getting the last pick of paths.

The main thing a lot of people will dislike here is the very large amount of luck in the die rolling that occurs when you fight zombies. Your resources will help to mitigate this, but you can still have an absolutely devastating roll that cripples your whole game. For the game length/weight, I didn't mind this, but I can see some people hating it.

Juego de lo más simple pero divertido. Consta de una subasta por la elección de orden de turno y un enfrentamiento a un par de cartas. La gracia del juego reside en la gestión de las fichas de gasolina, adrenalina y munición. La estética del juego (tanto caja como componentes) es un gran acierto.

Luck based dice rolling game. You have to manage resources and use them to bid for what path you want as well as for helping with situations. This is lots of fun with some good tension in the game. There is player elimination but this usually occurs late in the game so this isn't too bad. The limited amount of cards might limit the replayibility of the game as you'll get familiar with the cards but some cards are removed every game so there's a chance that your card might not be in the game. The production of this game is very good, making everything look like it was salvaged. Plays quick as well and overall a good fun game.

The idea that a kid made this game with things he's collected while traveling the country after a zombie Apocalypse makes this game and it's components quite charming. At it's core it's just a bidding and resource management game but the theme brings it together making it a fun almost filler-like game.

The game does a great job and making you feel like resources are very scarce and it brings a good amount of tension as you decide to give up those precious resources or let one of your people in your group die.

I kind of like this now that I realize it is just "survive the longest" but something doesn't feel right with the bidding.  I'm pretty sure the entire game is: keep the #1 card.  If you get in a bidding war with someone?  everyone?  you win and they lose.  You at least got the softest pick for your high bid and they just get hammered.   The game definitely has a downward spiral problem, and the person in 1st has the least of it.

Really clever theme and 'meta' applied to a poor game. I'm surprised that an artistic/thematic concept can account for an average rating above 7 for a game that:
has nothing mechanically new to offer, 
features game-deciding barely mitigated randomness, 
and features player elimination.

Those things don't work here any more than they do in any other design, and I think the average, in time, will reflect that.

Hit Z road gives you the feel of dread as your carefully hoarded resources and won battles crumble before the weight of overstretching at auctioning and a bad roll. And the you look at the pile of cards and see, that there are three more rounds left...

TRADED IT! (For Adventure Land)

Some of the best graphic design I have ever found in a game. The scavenged feel and homage to older game artwork (back cover) are fantastic. The simple auction and dice fighting mechanics work, but the game was just flat and I never felt very invested.

The melee portion of combat was very wonky. You roll more dice with more meeples, so you can score more hits, which makes sense, but you can also score more of your own deaths regardless of the size of the remaining enemy. There were many times in the game I had to fight one zombie, but since I had 5 survivors, I had to roll 5 dice and really rack up chances at killing myself (or at the very least wasting adrenaline).

The resources also felt odd. You almost always want adrenaline, since it avoids death and you do more killing chucking the dice an additional round than wasting a bullet resource on ranged attacks. The gasoline was useful I suppose, but I was never anywhere near dying in this game, so I never wanted to run from the few available points you can score.

If this game didn't look so damn cool, I would have nothing good to say about it.

Played twice. A good game; the physical production is very clever. Bidding for turn order, resource collection, and path selection are fun. Seems to hit just the right length. There can be a bit of downtime with another player throwing dice to defeat zombies, but it's not too bad. I worry a bit about replayability and the locations getting a little old.

A zombie auction game from Martin Wallace? Sure, why not. While I don't normally like the zombie theme, it didn't bother me here because of the thematic disconnect with the auction mechanism.

Awesome theme and graphic design on this one. Telling the story of the kid who is cobbling together a board game from the bits and pieces he finds, old dixit cards, splendor chips etc etc. Really really awesome.

And the game play is good fun too, paths of cards are laid out then you bid to chose turn order and who gets to pick which path they will trace down, many paths give you items, but many also contain zombies which you must deal with, either shoot'em from range using up precious resources or get in there with your fists but risk loosing guy..... hope to make it to the end of the road and then survivors count up points.... really fun and interesting.

Kind of liked it for what it was but MAN this game is hard.
Of course a lot of randomness but still some decent choices.
Would much rather like that the tokens said if they were good or bad on them. Now, as a n00b, I took tokens and later it turned out they were a detriment to my success.

Great art-direction. Main complaints? To long for such a random game and there seems to be too little variation in the cards (would need more).

I have only played this solo, and it feels compelling even though I tell myself it shouldn't. The production must have a lot to do with it. Speaking of the art, though, some of the cards are too creepy for my children, so I haven't been able to play it with them yet. I feel like I should let it go for space reasons, but it keeps surviving the periodic culls. Is this... a game collection zombie!?

It's not like I'm noob enough to think this will stay a 10, or that it is - in an objective sense - THAT good, but it conveys how much I want to play it right now. If I could play it right now, in the middle of writ...























Just kidding. I didn't really play it in the middle of that sentence. Jason owns it and he lives far, far away. 

I liked it though. I'm not sure that there is a ton of strategy, and there is a lot of luck, but it's a great combination of auction mechanics, multiple currencies (three-and-a-half!), and zombie theme. The winner will probably end up being the person who rolled best, but managing your currencies (which are also special abilities!) make a difference, and sometimes dice games are great. This very well may be great. I think three more plays would give me a final rating of four stars (8/10). The kid-makes-a-card-game meta-theme is fantastic.

Keeping in mind I have only played once, my "10" reflects my desire to get me next play in. And I reeeally want to play this again. Three currencies, where each currency can be spent on acquiring locations, or can be saved then spent for (highly necessary) special actions.

An auction/dice game that feels like nothing else I have ever played.

My rating will probably fall soon - to a 6 or an 8, but right now I can't wait to play again.

I feel like the game is trying to teach the players that working against each other will get everyone killed.  However, if you take turns going first instead of wasting precious resources biding for initiative, then everyone can survive.

I've played this once and won by sheer luck.  The other three players died in the 7th and 8th round.  I only made it to the end because I had a string of 8 lucky die rolls during the final round.  Despite winning, the game felt more agonizing than fun. 

"The only winning move is not to play."

RATING: 9
Hit Z Road is like a grindhouse flick directed by a auteur with an art-house sensibility. If you enjoyed Tarantino's Death Proof, you'll understand what I mean--here, it's pedestrian mechanics from a legendary designer that somehow say and do something more than they have a right to.

The gameplay itself is 7-ish, but is oddly engaging nonetheless. I'll talk about the many positives of the game in a moment, but first some of the more observable gaps of the design:

There is a notable absence of a catchup mechanism, and the game is subject to a runaway leader--which probably represents what would likely happen during the zombie apocalypse--but is less fun because of it. In fact, this is a game that once you've been bloodied, it's an easy slide to elimination.

The auction using the same resources as needed for encounter resolution is tense but frustrating. The lack of scoring opportunities is really the big problem here: the set of resources that are needed to choose scarce scoring opportunities via auction are the same set that allow you to succeed on those scoring opportunities. This is made worse by the fact that there are multiple end-game scoring bonuses based solely on remaining resources.

The VP amounts from the end-game bonuses are high (3) compared to the number of VPs collected from encounters (mostly 0s and 1s, some 2s) during the game, and given that most encounters do not offer any VPs, the bonuses can completely eclipse whatever happened during the course of the game.

So everything is really about the resources, with number of survivors a close second. The general strategy seems to be to hang back through the first (Chicago) deck, taking what encounters you get while conserving and gathering as many resources as necessary to get through the end game and hopefully snagging all the resource bonuses. It's harrowing at best, and counter-intuitive.

In effect, the game is something of a sly statement on modern games. Whereas resources are usually a means to an end (VPs) and worthless in themselves, this game is all about the resources themselves. To play effectively, you have to pass a large number of scoring opportunities that would be normal turn fodder in most resource-oriented games. This is a game about focus. It is anti-Feldian.

The design is well executed in its minimalism, but the strategic subtlety is probably lost on the target market this game will resonate with (zombies, dice). For buyers who know who Wallace is, there is more here than meets the eye, so it might be significantly better with experienced gamers. But even then, it takes some reflection and repeated plays that the game simply may not get.

There are some things that you could house-rule to make the game a little less brutal: a few extra resources at the beginning of the game, a rule limiting the number of bites or the amount of adrenaline needed during an encounter (e.g. max 1 bite, or spend 1 adrenaline for all bites), an alternative use for encounter cards without VPs (e.g. use once per game to increase a bid by 1).

But given all of these apparent shortcomings, I still rate the game very highly. My rating is more for the game as the overall conceit and subtle world-building in its fantastic production work, including the 50+ amazing Easter eggs to be found. You've probably noticed a few, including the unique game box art, but I had no idea there were so many gems hiding inside.

After the box and note on the cover of the rules, I further noticed something unusual when I realized that the large round game tokens were poker chip "gem" tokens from [thing=148228]Splendor[/thing], another [company=25842]Space Cowboys[/company] title. An evening later, I've honestly had as much fun finding and researching the Easter eggs as I've had playing the game. (Please see my post in forums section with detail on over 50 Easter eggs.)

In 2016, we're currently in an upswing of fashion where designers and publishers are trying to imbue their games with storytelling in order to deepen the emotional resonance of what is, in essence, playable math. Unfortunately, perhaps because of the limitations of the medium or because most game designers are not master storytellers, much of that storytelling seldom reaches beyond reliable but tired tropes, even cliche.

The failings of the current trend are why Mr. Martin and team's effort here is so groundbreaking. There is legitimately more depth in the details outlined above than in other games that purport to make storytelling a first-class feature of the experience, to the point that finding and decoding these details is itself a metagame. I am deeply impressed that Mr. Wallace and his team have the supreme confidence and courage to downplay such storytelling richness in order to let it subconsciously infuse the experience. It's brilliant in my opinion, and kudos to the entire team.

I'm not typically a zombie person, but I DO like Martin Wallace, and in this case, the Wallace pedigree trumps theme. (It also helps that the way this game looks and is packaged is brilliant.) The game does have some luck, but much of the luck seems to be on the side of those who bid and play wisely. That is to say, the game is more about managing resources than rolling dice. The risks are all calculated risks.

I really, really like this game and hope my friends will look past the theme, too.

RATING: 6
I played it twice and I had a blast (love theme and artwork).  This should result in a higher rating than a 6,  doesn't it ?
The game engine has though its problems:  if a player becomes resource leader he will always dominate the Auction Phase  and therefore pick the best locations to go to. 
 Rich getting richer, poor getting poorer.  This is the reason for the loss of 2 rating points. Once you know all the cards the narrative does not surprise you anymore which lowers my urge for a replay.
It‘s a rough diamond that needs some polishing and more variability to shine.

A very interesting auction/dice rolling game with just phenomenal art and graphic design. It would have been a great game without all the design touches like the card backs from other games and the inside insert to make it look dirty, but it wouldn't have been as wonderful to discover all these things as we played. 

Rounds went quickly with two people and we didn't read ahead to find out what the big tokens meant so when the route cards were laid out it made it a very fun first game as we encountered the ways they impacted us later on down the road.

The road I motored down on with my giant band of survivors inside The Executor. Oh yes. I was Furiosa and all the dice rolls were coming up Angel.

We wound up tying for the win, broken in my favour by my small sports team of survivors I had picked up along the way. I look forward to playing it with more people!

Definitely run away leader problem.  When you get into a nasty fight, you have to burn resources to survive.  Then because you now have less resources to bid with, you get stuck with another nasty fight that you couldn't bid high enough to avoid.  So you burn more resources to survive that fight, get stuck the worst scenario again because you lack resources, and the cycle continues.

This game should be just called "Z"; as in Z's when you're sleeping. This game is sure to put you to sleep because its boring as all hell. The bidding really limits your so-called "stratgey" as it does nothing more than suck up all of your resources and, in the end, you really end up relying on using luck based die rolls throughout the game. This game is all about rolling and praying for kills on the dice. Very boring and luck based.

Fun gameplay, really shines with 4 people (solitare is still decent) Even i dont like die resolution, zombie fights absolutely can be manipulated. Also there is a good euro gamey mechanic in that game, so i probably would like that much more than thematic zombie games. It includes player elimination, but it dont bother me anyway.

Although i dont like zombie theme, i like that game.

Card based dice game about surviving the zombie apocalypse. Cards show what you might face, players bid for the right to choose their fate (turn order), then you (maybe) fight zombies to survive. Some of the cards are worth points. There are a few resources that are simultaneously the bidding currency and ways to help you fight (or avoid) zombies. Best score among those alive at the end wins.

It is interesting to see how Martin Wallace has evolved from a leader of heavy euro game design into a pretty decent designer of light games. Hit Z Road is a dice chucking adventure game with players traveling from Chicago to Los Angeles fighting off ever-increasing hordes of zombies. The journey has eight legs and each leg consists of two randomly matched adventure cards. Players bid their precious resources in order to pick the path they want to travel. Players start with 5 survivors and 4 of each of the three resources (bullets, gas and adrenaline). Each resource has its own use, but also are paid interchangeably as players bid for the challenges they wish to face. Each card usually gives resources, has an event, and has zombies to defeat. Some cards, once defeated, gives you points at the end of the game. Players who survive facing 16 cards will add up points and determine a winner. 

Fighting zombies is accomplished through dice rolls, but this is probably the strangest part of the game. You roll a die for every survivor, regardless of the number of zombies you are facing, so 1 zombie is just as deadly in one round of combat as 8 zombies because every die rolled can potentially kill a survivor. In light of this, your objective is often to minimize extra rounds of combat. Often, it's not worth spending resources to bring the zombie count down if you can't kill them all and you'll need another round of combat anyway. The "rich-get-richer" criticism is legit, but it's such a short, light game it doesn't bother me.  Holding on by your fingernails can be more fun that having an easy time of it. The Space Cowboys production is wonderfully thematic and it's easy to get into the mood of this doomed cross-country trek. Replays are probably limited with the fairly small deck of cards.

UPDATE: Raised from a 6 to a 7. Everyone I've played this with has just really enjoyed it and so have I. Feels more like a 7 now than a 6.

I don't know how to rate this.  If I think about it as just a lite weight affair it is rather a very fun goofy light hearted affair.  On the other hand, as a game ranked against all others it is just a little too lite for my tastes.  It is a great warm up game when waiting for other guests to arrive, and the perfect 30 minute end of the game night game.  However, it could easily be expanded and perhaps some added depth to make it more interesting.  However, adding more complexity might kill the charm. So for a game based on other lite games it is an 8.  For a game compared to my entire collection it is a 6.5.

When I heard that Martin Wallace was designing a lighter game I was surprised because every time I heard his name it was basically describing his most recent complex eurogame. Although this isn't the lightest game it is fairly easy to explain to most people and it's theme can get it brought to the table fairly often. One thing about this game is that it's incredibly difficult. I have yet to make it to the end of a game alive and with that being said it is still a blast. Watching one person make it to the end with there resources depleted and only one survivor is such a hilarious feeling. This is a very fun game that happens to have a horrible name. Don't let that alone keep it out of your collection.

Actually completing and winning the game seems to fall down to luck of the card options each round. This is based on only one play, but we had not exactly a runaway leader, but more runaway losers, as one bad round ultimately lead to another and another as you lost all of your resources to bid for turn order.

Best thing about this game is the graphic design. It looks like a cobbled together game, made out of snapshots and scavenged remains of other boardgames.

It has one huge flaw: being last in the player order is too negative. Thus people throw massive amounts of resources towards said player order. Which means you don't have enough for later.
We haven't survived to the end of the deck yet. Closes we came was 6 cards left in a three player game.

I was completely shocked by this game. I thought it looked dumb, and had no interest playing. As it was being set up, I regretted hanging around. I made a huge mistake in the first round and nearly sent my family to their doom in round 1. But what I found after I got past my own preconceptions was a fantastic and thematic press your luck game with some of the coolest components (thematically) I have encountered in a board game. Not only that, but it was hard! The game almost feels like a co-op in difficulty, except we are all alone. If you love dice chucking, zombies, and nostalgia... this game has it in spades. Very cool.

RATING: N/A
In the fast-paced and morbidly kitschy game Hit Z Road, you and your fellow players embark on a road trip going south from Chicago along America's famous Route 66 — now infested by zombies. As you travel though a deck of adventure cards rife with dangers, you battle zombie hordes, drive abandoned school buses, scavenge for gas and bullets, and explore a darkened, tainted American countryside full of shambling undead, haunted carnivals, and plumes of toxic gas. Your goal is to stay alive until you reach the safe, sandy beaches of the California coast.

Three different stages of adventure cards create an experience of increasing difficulty and ensure that each playthrough is unique. Each round begins with an auction that determines both player order and which cards you will encounter. Since the resources used for bidding are the same as those used to battle the oncoming zombie hordes, your survival depends as much on your resource management as it does upon winning those bidding wars. The player who either accumulates the most points or survives the longest wins.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm not massively keen on all things Z, but the theme is strong and the components and artwork aren't just pretty, they're clever too. 
Heavily luck-based, but there are some resource management decisions to be made and deciding how to value the different paths isn't as straightforward as it looks. If someone gets well ahead in resources then they will be hard to stop, unless they make mistakes or roll badly.
A good game for a light pub-based session, but be warned, it is brutal. The players aren't mollycoddled, they are pulled screaming from their cars by desperate monsters and savaged by the side of the road. When you roll that last skull and your leader dies, your opponents don't cheer, they just wind up their windows, drive on and try not to think about what horrors await them too. 
Probably the kind of thing Martin W knocks out in his sleep.

Being an old style Martin Wallace fan, I am sorry having to say that this is again a nothing game. Bidding for turn order, choose a road (cards to fight against) by means of rolling dice, then you either win or the zombies win. That's about it. Besides that simplicity, it has a strong the rich get richer problem. The gameplay is silly and it just doesn't work.

Mi opinión en http://zacatrus.es/u/miqueljornet:

☛ Demostrado en #AJ2016.

✔ Ante todo, el concepto que más me ha sorprendido de este juego es la metahistoria planteada sobre su creación. Se podría decir que es un "mockgame" en el mismo sentido que un "mockumentary" en inglés quiere significar un "falso documental". Aquí se plantea que el juego ha sido creado por un niño llamado Martin que ha sobrevivido a una epidemia zombi recorriendo con su padre los Estados nidos de Chicago a Los Angeles. Como ta no tiene que ir a clases y tiene tiempo libre, Martin ha canibalizado componentes de otros juegos de mesa ya existentes para crear uno que explique su gran aventura... podemos ver fichas de poker con pegatinas encima, cartas de una baraja reutilizadas y con notas autobiográficas de Martin, alguna carta de Dixit, 7 Wonders, ¡Aventureros al Tren! o Guerra Fría: CIA vs. KGB. Todos esos guiños enamoran a cualquier jugador.    
✔ Se nota que la producción es un capricho de edición de los Space Cowboys. El autor es un top y los ilustradores quizá más si cabe. Las cartas son hiperrealistas, algunas parecen fotogramas de escenas reales de una película o serie de zombis, con desenfoque y bokeh incluso. Este arte tan cuidado hace que el juego rezume tema y narrativa muy fácilmente. Además, para potenciar esta idea, cada jugador va guardando las cartas de localizaciones por las que va pasando en orden cronológico a modo de pequeño cuaderno de bitácora que al finalizar la partida serviría perfectísimamente de story board para cualquier guión cinematográfico para una película de este subgénero. 
✔ Mecánicamente no deja de ser un juego de subastas, gestión de recursos y dados muy sencillo. Los jugadores tienen que intentar balancear aquello con lo que se encuentran con lo que consumen o pueden llegar a consumir si la suerte de los dados no les sonríe en sus encuentros con las horadas de muertos vivientes. Algunos combos son simpáticos. Y parece que no hay partida en la que no se haga presente alguna dosis de epicidad en los combates cuerpo a cuerpo. Funciona y es divertido. 
✔ Las variantes para 1, 2 y 3 jugadores parecen estar bien implementadas. Especialmente brillante me parece la adaptación para disfrutarlo en solitario, que juega con el papel de la incertidumbre para sustituir la no interacción con otros jugadores. Simple pero eficaz.

✘ Entras en la web de Asmodee Ibérica y da la sensación de que este juego (estando editado en español y con las singularidades que aporta) ni existe. Según ellos las novedades a día 4 de diciembre de 2016 (plena campaña de Navidad) son: Raptor, Barony, Zombies vs. Cheerleaders, Doctor Panic, Pingo Pingo y La Posada Sangrienta. Es vergonzoso tener tan mal actualizada una web de un sector en alza y con cada vez más afición ávida de información fresca sobre novedades.
✘ El juego tiene eliminación de jugadores (y me consta que hay gente a la que no le gustará nada quedarse fuera de la partida)... pero no llega a ser nada molesto porque en el contexto está más que justificado e incluso resulta muy temático. ¿Acaso no perderíamos compañeros de viaje en una situación de éxodo de una epidemia zombi? Pues el juego también refleja esa crueldad.
✘ El PVP podría ser más contenido. Si valoramos el arte se paga a gusto... pero si valoramos la relación precio con la cantidad de componentes se antoja caro, ya que no deja de ser un mazo de cartas, unos dados y unas fichas.
✘ Creo que Asmodee Ibérica habrá realizado una tirada pequeña de este juego en castellano. Últimamente se ve a esta filial muy falta de confianza en sus propios productos. No se los cree y por eso no arriesga (también es verdad que no los lista en su web, no los presenta, ni los mueve en las redes sociales... y este círculo vicioso no perdona en un momento en el que la edición de juegos se ha disparado y la competencia está "on fire"). Da pena que juegos en castellano como Seasons y otros de esta filial se agoten tan rápido y no se reediten... quizá a este Hit Z Road le pueda pasar lo mismo (y tiene una ligera dependencia del idioma con cartas con algo de texto). Con la cantidad de gente que hay buscando trabajo con ganas de hacer las cosas bien. :-(

I was really pleasantly surprised by this game's solo variant.  It provide a decent challenge and keeps one engaged without overstaying its welcome.  Easy to learn and quick to play.

The game may not be the most beautiful one on the market (don't get me wrong, it's very pretty), but in my opinion, it is the most appropriate and best done piece of graphic design I've seen so far! From the weathered box to the bottle cap tokens and coffee stained playing cards, this game as a whole is a thematic work of art!

Cool theme and components and it's a game with fun moments when you are fighting the Zombies...
Seems to have a fatal flaw that if if you spend you resources then you are out of the race in any auction because people that have more than you will have to be extremely unlucky for you to be able to get back to their level and without resources you are always going to the path that no one else wants and it's usually the path that has few or even no resources to scavenge.... You are there dependent only on luck nothing more

Messed up 3 player setup, so rating isn't set in stone.  Needs more plays.  I'm a little bit worried about the possibility for early player elimination, but I will reserve judgement on that until I get some more plays in.  I think I will warn players to really be careful about bidding wars in the early game.
On the flip side, this is a ZOMBIE game, so the risk of death (player elimination) is quite high.  Looking forward to get this played some more.

I wasn't expecting too much out of this game, but I came away very satisfied. This is definitely not a game you would normally see come out from Martin Wallace, as it's fairly rules-light. In many ways, this feels more akin to a Knizia game, and not just because of the auctions. The game is also incredibly thematic. The components are all really evocative, and a lot of the individual cards you travel to almost tell mini stories of their own. 

About the only bad things I can say about this game are with some of the components. The box is entirely too big for this game, and the dice are sucky quality. I typically hate wooden dice, but these are pretty awful wooden dice. Also, as others have said, the bidding does seem to be a bit off. I think a simple fix would be to hide your resources from everyone else, but there almost needs to be a concentrated effort from players to beat on the first player. Someone who goes first more than 2 or 3 rounds in a row has a really good chance of winning.

Yeah, the name is really dumb, and zombie games are a dime a dozen nowadays, but Hit Z Road has about done the impossible; It made a solid and fun Euro game with the zombie theme. High praise from me on this one. This is probably in my top five from Martin Wallace at this point.

This is probably my favorite Martin Wallace game. It's thoughtful, it's tense, it's fast, and best of all - it's funny. You will grit your teeth on your turns and stifle guffaws while your friends and family take theirs. It's honestly underated, and it is true what people say - the zombie theme just doesn't matter and it looks great on a table. It's also worth noting on here that for a game with dice, the dice don't detract from how strategic and decisive the auction portion of the game is. The dice can be mitigated with careful planning enough to make you truly feel like your choices matter, while being unpredictable enough to provide some memorable experiences.

The theme and components really make this game shine, and combat is quite simple and fun.  The auction phase offers a very subtle blend of resource management to the mix.  The unidentified special tokens can be pretty frustrating when you have no way of properly weighing their pros and/or cons.  The first phase of the game can seem to coast a little too heavily on auto-pilot as you are mainly gathering resources.  Best with 4 players.

For two players it slowly ratchets up. At first its just simple auctioning and dice rolling, nothing to be afraid of.  But by the third tier of challenge cards it turns out you really can die in a zombie horde attack.  Good fun and I loved the 50s charm.

A fun little survival game. It's too much dice rolling for my tastes, but I'd play it on occasion. It does at least capture that feeling of having only a few bullets left, having just a little further to go to get to safety, and having to deal with a hoard of zombies in your way. The artwork/theme is really great.

A road trip just as the zombie apocalypse breaks out...cancel the trip...of course not.
An interesting game where there are snapshots of scenes from your zombie road trip.
Places you've been and people you met along the way.
In this game you will be choosing a route of 2 cards.

You can see the route that lies ahead and see what good and bad awaits you.
Do you go the route that yields mega bullets and lots of zombies to fight?
Or do you go the route that offers gas and victory points and a Horde to fight?
Or maybe the victory points are sweeter on another route?

Tough decisions, but an interesting new take on push your luck.
Because you can bid for first initiative, but that will cost you tokens...precious gas, bullets or adrenaline that you will probably need on just the route you are hoping to take first by winning the bid.
Trust me, I made that mistake in my first game.

You might gain new survivors.
But the game is last man standing wins too.
So if you lose survivors to the point you have none you lose.
If by chance you and your opponent(s) make it to the end together, then you count up any victory points you gained in the game.

The attention to detail in making this game look like it was hobbled together from items found in various houses/places is amazing. From the car keys, to the bottle caps, to the deck of playing cards for the actual cards, it all blends together amazingly.

The game is light, basically a risk management type of game. You want to avoid the zombies, but at the same time, most of those cards will give you points. Just trying to survive is a challenge. Yes this game has player elimination, but you won't be out for more than 10-15 minutes at best. Artwork is phenomenal and everything is just top notch.

Even though zombies are such a tiresome theme, this manages to do it fairly well.

The found-during-the-zombie-apocalypse components bring about a bunch of laughs, the game plays quickly, and decision points come one after another. The auction to choose the path you want to take---as examples, a path with lots of zombies garners many points for fighting and defeating them or maybe you want a path with the gas, ammo, or adrenaline you truly need to trek on---is heart of the game, as you can push a player to pay dearly for a desired path, thus diminishing the very resources needed to survive. Fun theme and narrative.

Light game from Martin Wallace, comparable with Witches or Nebula. But I find those  2 latter more enjoyable. This game, while mechanically perfectly OK, could inspire me. I have the feeling that playing cowardly is more rewarding then being brave, as then you just have to wait until the others are killed.

Lowered rating (7 -> 6) after 3 times. Because this is the 3rd time the game suffered from rich get richer, due to the fact that 1 player at a certain moment has tons of chits, so in fact controls the whole thing and can take the easy route time after time, until the rest is dead or he simply claims all bonus rewards at the end and wins that way on points.

I also didn't mind this one. 

It's probably the best zombie game I've played, but perhaps that isn't saying too much. It's definitely very light -- just an auction game with push your luck and flip a card/die to see what happens mechanics. 

All that said, I think I enjoyed this more than I expected (though perhaps not as much as I had hoped). Nice art and components.

Martin Wallace Dice games about getting points and fighting Zombies. I hate Zombies so this was rally not an appealing game for me to try out and play. It was actually an interesting auction game with a nice push your luck element to it. I turned out to like this a bit more than I anticipated. It is a nice dice game. I just wish it had ANY OTHER theme... Then it might be a game I actually own. As it stands I would be willing to play this one again, despite the theme.

Though Zombies might be the zeitgeist at the moment, they've been gnawing at the back of my mind since I was a teen, but as with Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, horror and the like I've grown away from marketed mythology. Yet this design still eats away at my brain, mainly because of the first person perspective portrayed in the menacing artwork which effectively gives the game genuine chills as does the simplistic narrative of ranged and the hasty hand to hand combat. 
But the typical auction mechanism has typical issues so may just have to either settle for The Lost Expedition or the dreaded wallet devouring monster called Arkham Horror: TCG.

RATING: 3
Each round you put out a path of 2 cards. Players then bid with the tokens they need to survive their future encounters, in order to be first to select the path they want. Everyone pays their bid even if they don't pick first, because player order is that rather than clockwise. Then if you hit a card that has zombies you roll some dice. You can mitigate your situation by spending tokens. lather rinse repeat until all but one player is eliminated, or if 2 people live somehow (how?) then you look at points.

The game also gets harder as you work your way through the deck. The game will at times give you tokens, but it won't explain what the tokens do until another card comes out that will either help you or punish you for having the token. I guess this improves if you want to subject yourself to multiple plays. The replayability comes from the fact you remove 4 cards randomly from each 'era', potentially a 12 card difference between games, but I don't see this changing the feel of the game in any significant way.

The game far overstayed it's welcome, but if you were to shorten it, then you wouldn't get the thematic sense of dwindling supplies and dwindling hope. The real issue with the game is a lack of interesting choices. All you really do aside from rolling dice is decide how much to bid, and as the game goes on and the players get poorer, even this one decision is taken away.

This recent Wallace game had completely passed me by (zombie theme, terrible name) but it's been played a few times by my group recently and sounded quite fun. I liked it! Players have to survive over the course of 8 rounds, each round bidding to select the best (or least worst) set of two encounter cards. But the resources you bid with are the same ones you need to fight off zombies AND the resources you have left over at the end make up a big chunk of the scoring. Zombie combat is resolved with handfuls of dice (to cheers and groans) and it's entirely possible to be eliminated before the end. It's not a long game though, and we only had an elimination on the last round.

A solid and thematic game about auctioning off who will get the least bad thing.  Plus dice.  Plus zombies.

It's two themes in one, and both are very well done.  There is the boy who made a game out of post-apocalyptic junk, and there is the game he made about surviving zombie attacks.

The 9 tokens you sometimes gain create a neat minimalistic emergent narrative.  I wish there were more of that to creating mini-branching narratives every time.

The solo game is a bit too easy.  Multiplayer is brutal, random, and awesome.

It has an incredible theme that came through big time at every second of the game. The rumored runaway leader issue of the bidding is easily fixed by playing with hidden resources.

It's a resource gathering/managing game, with some risk/reward elements, bidding, dice rolling, player elimination, and more planning than one would imagine. Oh and the solo game is solid too.

This game has potential, but there are two problems I see:
1) I don't think the auctions are right. Off the top of my head I think hidden bids or a For Sale style system that sees people drop out a half cost and only the winner pays full would be better.
2) Resources should be hidden. This would make the zombie conflicts more tense, and make the competitions for the awards more uncertain.

I'm not much one for zombie games; I just never really got much into the theme. And yet, I like how the theme of this draws you in. The auctions are tough, and it's easy to get caught up in spending a bunch of items just to avoid a difficult path and then be too shorthanded to be able to handle the very difficult late-game encounters. Definitely lots of tension, fast-playing, and wonderful art makes this an enjoyable game.

Last game for the night! This is a pretty simple, light zombie apocalypse game of survival. Players try to get their group of survivors to the end of the journey (game) across the country, although it's possible for everyone to die. In our game, the rest bid VERY high in the first round. The rest of the game, I was generally able to choose the encounters I wanted. Toni and Mary died, but Ted and I made it all the way to the final round. Ted had a great set of rolls, but still died; I, on the other hand, had a VERY POOR set of rolls ... and also died!

Fun game, not without some gamer-ly decisions (bidding, resource management) but with a bit too much randomness/chaos for me. Great production, though! 

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Each round, use your resources (ammo, gas, adrenaline) to bid on turn order (once around, raising if you're overbid, max bid 10 -- no duplicates). In turn order, choose one of the destinations on display for this round (3 phases in game, with harder stops in later phases). These might first give you some scavenged resources (e.g., more ammo), then have some event (e.g., find another survivor), then give you a number of zombies to fight. Fighting goes something like this: first, you may spend some ammo to roll d6 (kill on 4+?). Then, each round of combat: you may spend gas to escape. If you stay, you roll one d6 per survivor. You could roll a hit (kill a zombie), possible hit (spend adrenaline to kill), bite (kill a survivor; maybe spend adrenaline to cancel), or miss. Later in the game, some zombie hits cannot be prevented. If you survive the card, add it to your score pile (each may be worth VP at end of game).

After everyone's turn, repeat through up to 8 rounds or until all but one player has been eliminated. If more than one survivor reaches LA, whoever scored the most VP (encounter cards) wins!

My only issue with it that keeps it in the "okay" rating is that there seems to be a lot of elements outside of player control.  So while there may be a lot of tense moments, only about 25% of that comes from the decisions you make and the other 75% comes from seeing what the game throws at you.

This game is beautiful. The mechanics are nice and clean. It gets a little more random than I'd like. 1 bad fight can wipe you out completely. But you're just as likely to randomly make it through something hard without a scratch. As long as you don't take it too seriously, it's a lot of fun. Somehow packs all the punch of a much bigger zombie game in a very small package.

The theme and components are a 10. I can't believe how clever it is. A must if you appreciate great art and game components. And the game IS great, it's just a little bit against my own taste, which knocks it down to a 7.

Player elimination sucks in every way. A huge problem with this game is the rich get richer and the poor die and lose interest in game night because there is not enough excitement to keep eliminated players interested. I know there is supposed to be a story here but there just isn't. 

Gorgeous art though!

tl;dr: too luck based for me

Turn order in this game is crucial. Turn order is auctioned off every round. So people with more resources, have an advantage. So they're more likely to go first and get the best loot. So they get more resources. It seems to me, and my co-players that there is a tipping point. If you miss the first spot on an auction, and the next rounds don't let you compensate for that, because of the way the cards come out, there is no way to catch up and the rich keep on getting richer.
Maybe one play is not enough to figure out a way around this, but I didn't find this game interesting enough to want to try again. It's just not the type of game that gets my juices flowing in the right way. Bid for turn order, do the best you can with what you have and hope the next round goes well. It's not very deep and strategy is a bit limited. Nope, not for me.

Initial rating: 6/10
BGG scale: 4/10

Strange zombie apocalypse dice chucking fest mixed with an tough auction. Players bid on first choice of which row of 2 encounter cards to take. Each row, has a mix of resources to collect, events to resolve and zombies to fight. Some rows are clearly better than others, which means you bid more resources to get first choice, which depletes your resources for future turns. Roll dice, fight zombies, try to survive. The adrenaline resource provides some needed dice mitigation. You occasionally collect tokens during the game that can affect you in future encounters. The difficulty ramps up as the game progresses. There seems to be the possibility of the rich get richer syndrome as the ones with the most resources get to take the best paths which are often the ones that provide the most resources at the least risk. I've only played it with two, so maybe it is balanced out with more players competing for the good paths. The art design is really good. The story line is that the game was assembled from bottle caps and spare cards as their group spent the summer trying to get from Chicago to LA.

An auction game with player elimination?  Hell yes.  This is a simple auction game that leverages the aforementioned "forbidden rule" not found in most Euros, takes delight in not holding the players' hands at all when the game shits on you, and ultimately does a pretty damn good job at simulating a zombie-apocalypse-roadtrip.  Like most Wallace designs, there's more here than you think and tough decisions become the focal point faster than you want them to.

9/24/2016: Really random due to card draws and dice rolling.  Bad snowball effect due to resources and bidding.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played with 4 players and we had really fun with this game! I liked that even tho the cards are random the different paths that are created really different and makes the bidding part very important and fun! We actually made it to the end of the game, with only 1-2 survivors left in our teams. Which really shows how well designed and balanced the game is. We all loved it!

And I just have to say that this game has the most amazing and clever art and graphic design I have seen in a board game :D The story behind the actual game is about a boy who found this old game called Hit the road that he resigned using pen & paper, stickers, bottle caps, photos glued to old playing cards etc. The guy who came up with the idea of the design for this game is a genius!

This is a game that does not get nearly enough attention. The game mechanics mix a little bit of auctioning, exploration and press your luck (rolling a bunch of wooden dice that look handmade - part of the theme).  The rules are simple and gameplay is quick and tight.  There is not a lot of downtime during other players turns.

This is a rare game that actually plays better in solitaire.  It is easy to win but that is offset by a cute point tracking system that often forces you into difficult choices.  Nothing is better than winning at the "Call me Darrell" level.  

The best feature of Hit Z Road are its components.  This is where the game just oozes theme.  It looks hand made from whatever a family might have on hand during a vacation trip in the 50s.  Exploration cards are made from various sets of promotional playing cards with blood smeared on the backs, to let you know that the trip has not all been fun and games.

If you need a fun and campy game to kick off a night of playing Zombicide or Dead of Winter, Hit Z Road would be a terrific choice.

First play: Only two-player, and it was fun. Neither of us survived, because we weren't managing our resources well, but she lasted longer than I did--and I was rooting for her to survive, because it was easy to buy into the theme. There's a lot of randomness and whooping over dice rolls, so it's not the main course of good gaming session, but a very nice side dish. Obviously, with more plays, my opinion may change.

Second play: With two players, meh. I don't think we're going to like many games that are basically random, with flavor text attached. You could house rule the auction to make it work better with two, but why bother, really. But the look of the game is great, obviously, and we're glad to have it. We'll play it with friends every now and then, I'm sure.

Later, after a session with 4 players: This is a good game to pull out with gaming friends, once. I doubt that it could really sustain a lot of extended plays, because this game is really all about theme. One time of screaming over dice rolls is good, twice is really not. But that one play is a lot of fun for a light game featuring the playful art, so I think over the years it will be nice to pull out occasionally, but probably never repeat it with the same people.

A light zombie game with a lot of theme and tension, even at 2p. If you're looking for something heavy look elsewhere. The only flaw for us is replayability at 2p as you're going to see all the cards eventuality and it is a game that will flourish with a group of people who like the theme a weight.

The production values on this thing are out of this world. It's a bit like I'd imagine a Fallout game would be, with bottle cap currency, repurposed playing cards, and absolutely wonderful post apocalyptic art. It really is one of the best looking games I have ever seen.

The game lacks a little bit in the variety department, when it comes to game play, however. It's basically an auction game followed by a push-your-luck dice game. That isn't my complaint though, as both of those things are really well done here. Running through those phases is a blast! My problem is that the utterly gorgeous deck of cards that makes up the adventure is quite small. I can't imagine there is more than two or three runs through this game before it gets really repetitive.

I don't know, maybe I just want the game to be more than it is because the graphic design is so damned glorius.  I think this game could easily have been delivered as a $15 dollar deck of cards, so maybe that is where my hesitation lies. At any rate, it's worth picking up if you get a deal but no way would I drop $40 on it, even if the "look" is worth every penny of that.

Fast hybrid euro and dice chucking zombie hybrid game on a random 2x4 street grid of card locations. Bidding plays a big part in the constant struggle between gaining resources and not getting eaten. Produced and packaged as a faded, scuffed and stained vintage copy from the 50’s.

A great theme and really charming components (borrowed from other board games). The bidding turn order mechanism is solid, and the various "roads" you can go down create some tense decisions of weighing resources versus risk. A lot of dice-chucking, but you can mitigate a great deal of it. Player elimination possibility would bother some people.

Another zombie game, but a quite unique one. The bidding phase is relatively quick so the bulk of the game is in resolving the path the players select. The cool thing is, while you're competing with each other, you can also reach LA with multiple players. So you're actually rooting for the other players to kick the sh*t out of the zombies. At least I am. I'd rather win on points rather than being the last man standing. Resource management is very important so don't overbid right from the start. You'll regret it later!

i am attracted by the fantastic artwork and a little bit sense of humor appear in some detail in the game. Although my gaming group is cautious  in the game so on the bidding phrase we didnt compete too intense and only one of four get killed til the very last moment of the game,i still think the press-your-luck mechanism is quit balanced and is not overwhelming the other factors in the game.the game is all about how good you can do under a uncertain condition with 
 resource scarcity.
But the replayablilty of the game is extremely low.The game has a very nice concept on the story of the game wherever on the cover of the box ,the rule book or the cards.The story line is mainly constructed by the special tokens in the game which will have some positive or negative effects later during the game.But it has a problem that is the game is too concretizing and there is only one story line to discover.This is  both the main failure of the game and the main attractive thing about the game.This is contradictory.The game is all about the  co-feeling，but if it use a more abstract 上sense to create the game，for example，delete the story on the rulebook or the cards and those special circular tokens,I
definitely wont play
 it even for once becauce that is the major selling point of the game I think.

Single player is poor.   This really should have been a 2-4 player game with a solo variant.   The auction aspect is completely removed in solo play which is a big part of the enjoyment of the game.   Unless you are unlucky you can manage against the "hidden" nature of the auction replacement system and the game become very bland.

RATING: 6
a solid, family friendly, approachable game. The checkers-like mechanic makes it very easy for anyone including kids around 5 years old likely to be able to quickly pick the game up, but the tension between the set collection and reducing your sets to get powerups makes it more interesting than it may appear at first blush. It's not complex enough or riotous enough for it to hit my table that often, but I think its a fantastic fit for many families.

Ein schönes, leichtgewichtiges Strategiespiel. Hat mehr Tiefgang, als es erst den Anschein hat und spielt sich schnell.

I'm not one for abstracts much these days but this is a great game to play with kids. The privilege cards are fun, as are the scoring options. Love the art!

A neat little abstract that doesn't outstay its welcome. Wish there were a few more scoring cards as you see the same combinations too often. Really simple to teach and play.

What a fun little game.  Very quick, easy to learn, easy to teach game with a checker type mechanic.  The frogs you jump you take and collect the different colors for points or for their powers.  Each color has their own power.  We enjoyed it a ton, and can't wait to play again.  Three of us might have been a half an hour.

i don't get the bad comments about this. I highly enjoyed this and i tend to like heavy games as well. This is just a nice filler game with a fun move mechanism.

I can recommend it to anyone who sometimes like games that are not that serious (Camel Up etc..)

RATING: 6
Simple game with little strategic depth, but on the other hand unncecessary complexity caused by a lot of privilige cards with different functions. In my opinion therefore a little bit too complex for families and too light for experienced players.

A light, quick and fun family game. The theme isn't particularly strong so it's more of an abstract game, but the pieces and artwork are nice so it should appeal to families and younger kids, and there are actually some interesting decisions for more serious gamers, particularly 2 player.

Belle le ranocchie colorate, che si ottengono scavalcandole ortogonalmente con altre rane, sulla scacchiera dello stagno. Combina interessanti elementi di tattica e strategia, restando un gioco semplice ed originale.

Gyakorlatilag egy megbolondított halma. A pályán négy színben békaharcosok vannak, a saját körünkben kötelező átugrani egy békaharcossal egy másikat, az átugrottat pedig levesszük, magunk elé tesszük. Opcionális akcióként ezután beadhatunk egy békaharcost, ami valamilyen előnyt biztosít.
Főleg set collectionös célok vannak, nyíltak, titkosak, kártyákat vihetünk el játék közben, amelyek további pontokat, vagy újabb lépéslehetőségeket (átlósan, nekifutással, L alakban) adnak.
Nem rossz. Sőt, egész jó játék, a kivitelezés kiemelkedő, elveszi valamennyire az absztrakt ízét.

Unsure about this game. There was no wow factor for me, but I think I will keep it around because it's different than all the others I own. Quick and easy, too.

First impression: played 2x with 3 players each game. Very quick, light game for kids and families. My 9 and 4 yr old boys enjoyed it, which makes me like it too. Set collection games go well in our family. 

Things I didn't like are the small cards...ugh. They are getting worn on edges just after 2 plays. The colors are hideous. Is it a brown or maroon frog? Not much player interaction.

Interested to see how this plays with 4p.

Set collection leap frog. I liked the concept, but the gameplay just fell a little flat.

Way better than last year's Animals on board. I guess it's also fun with kids (haven't tried yet), but it definitely works with adults and while luck is a factor in this game, you can mitigate some of it at least. Several strategies can work out and it's still a nice, short, and neat game.

Family style abstract game. Plays very fast and you are leap frogging around the board collecting different colored frogs. It is set collection for final end game points. I enjoyed this game. I think it will be a bigger hit for kids and families for the ease and playtime. I would happily play it again!

The is a very light and easy game. Good for younger kids getting into games. Checkers like movement with set collection. Each color frog has special abilities as well, but it didn't seem like that was something that would be used all that often.

Like chinese checkers, but without the continued bounce and adding set collection. It's pretty fun, although I think the pieces should have really just been frogs. I also think the cover art is probably going to turn away some people and the game won't be as successful as it should be.

Simple set collection game with checkers-esque movement rules. The twist is the ability to return frog in order to get bonus actions or cards. Solid family game, but not amazing.

Fun game. Similar to Checkers in that you jump over pieces in order to claim pieces for yourself. But this game has four different colors of pieces, set collection goals (both public goals and private goals) and special cards you can collect.

The heart of the game is the push-and-pull of how you use the frogs you collect. You want to collect frogs because they give you points at the end of the game, but you can discard the frogs during the game to get special bonuses. Some of the cards that you collect can give you ongoing abilities like letting you move a piece across the board before making your jump or letting you jump diagonally instead of just orthogonally.

For such a simple game, some of the cards can even reward different strategies. There are cards that give you points for jumping onto certain colored spaces or cards that reward you for having the least amount of different things, when you usually want to have as much stuff as possible.

This isn't really a strike against the game, but it comes with comedically unnecessary player aids. On a turn you have to (a) make a jump, then you can (b) optionally discard a frog for an ability. The small-card player aid shows this. You know, in case you forget the two things that you can ever do on a turn. A better player aid would have been something that explained all of the different icons that appear in the game.

Frogriders nails what I like in a light game. It plays in 45 minutes at most, it has incredibly simple gameplay, but there's enough to think about to keep it engaging.

Family filler of leap frogging gnome riders.  Seed the Lilly-padded checker board with colored frog riders.  Hop them for set collection scoring or to turn into the village for a color determined bonus and rule breaking upgrades.

RATING: 5
Intriguing looking frog jumping game with moves similar to those peg solitaire games I played as a child. As an adult, I don't find this type of abstract appealing. The kid in me loved Hi-Q so I would think this is a fine family game with its colorful frog bits. There's some set collection with frog colors and extra actions available through cards and frog trading to keep it from boring adults too much.

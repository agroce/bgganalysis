Perhaps it was that I just didn't get it or something, but there simply seems to be no interesting choices throughout the game. The placing of the "klongs" seems rather obvious most of the time, so the outcome seems to be dictated by luck for the most part.

I might be wrong, though, and am willing to give it a couple more plays to see if there is something that just hasn't clicked in me yet.

I prefer the tactical variant of the BK, as mentioned in the rulebook. It is fewer luck when you drawing a boat-tile as it first seems. It´s much more important to bring it on the right landing place, and the interactivity is high. That is ensured by placing the police, thief and double-point boats or moving your two-times own boats. Personal i like it more with 3 or 4 players, because a 2 player lets BK feels more as a destroy the best places of your opponent.

RATING: 6.5
Played without the more tactical version. One player got almost no empty boats and could place significally fewer merchants than the others. Not too balanced in that version. Like to try the other one.

UPGRADE: 5 -> 6.5
Much better in the tactical version, where you can choose which type of boat (neutral/ownable) to draw.

Interesting game. I wasn't expecting this game to be as good. Game play is quick with little downtime. I like games like this with card play and positioning. There is luck with the card draw, and that could break the game, but players still need to play the cards right.

The colour scheme is really beautiful.  So much for the positives.  The game mechanism that doesn't allow you to play a fourth boat in a slip is probably needed, but really hard to see on the board.  Doing what you want in the game is highly dependent on luck of the draw.  If you want to collect a certain type of boat, you either need to keep drawing those ones (with seats) or get one of the thieves.  The thieves are a problem too - it's never fun to get targetted by screwage.  And those seats - if you draw nothing but boats without seats time and again (as I did), then you have no way to get your men on the board and score.  Ugh.

I might have liked this more had I not read the rulebook and seen a warning about how important it is to make your goods match. So I made sure my goods matched as much as possible and watched while that lost me the game by a large margin. Maybe the real game is better?

Interesting tactical game with a cute theme. Not good with 2 players as players will react to each other's actions, and thus it basicly comes down to 'luck of the draw'. Best with 3 players, and with the tactical variant.

A clever tile laying game, slightly obscured by a not-so-great rulebook. The rules definitely made it harder to learn than it should have been. The cover is way too green, but the board and tile art is much more appealing. Would play again.

RATING: 5.5
Very interesting. It's got a bizarre scoring mechanic. There are tactics there but I'm not sure they're incredibly deep as everyone just blocks each other and if you are lucky with your boats and get blocked off less then you're probably odds on to win.

Market days seem to throw all planning out the window. I would change market days (at least the first 2) this way:

1. The boats are not removed as each player is scored. 
2. Instead, a man of the scoring player's color replaces the black man administrator. 
3. The same spot cannot be used twice on the same market day. So, if a player's man is on a spot, the black man cannot be put on that spot the rest of that market day.
4. After both rounds are completed on a market day, then the boats are removed. The 2 men of each player show where the black man was and the boats are removed as normal.

With this change, I think my rating would increase from 7 to 9.

Looks and feels a bit like a Friedemann Friese -game. Is quite prone to analysis paralysis. The thief and the possibility to screw others during the big market scoring may irritate some players. Ok, those were the bad things. On the positive side, the game is well balanced, thematically and mechanically interesting, the scoring system is really good, especially because of the added set collection in the end, and the thief and the possibility to screw others during the big market scoring will definitely please some players. Flavorwise it's fun that the corrupted inspectors catch thieves and put them back on the market to work for a new employer.

Played this for the first time with Lee; a game which she won.  You are trying to balance for end game points as well as aggressively jockeying for in-game points, maximizing your scoring opportunities while tactically screwing your opponent over on theirs.  Thematically appeals to Lee, takes only 10 minutes to explain.  I'm hoping this type of game opens Lee up to more mechanically complex games.

As a 2 player game Rating is a good 6, as a 4 player its a 3. I think that Mr. Schlegel designs his games as 2-player games and those good ideas have to be sold as 2-4 player games. Bangkok as a two player is really interesting especially if you play it with the advanced (separate stacks) version. The same game as 3 or 4 player game is a good exercise in king-making. But I really like the artwork

RATING: 6
I've only played this online and it might be a little more appealing as a physical game, as the pieces look fun to play with. But... it's a solid enough game that feels very abstract and repetitive. Low in direct conflict--mostly the conflict is just about getting in the other person's way, though occasionally you can steal one of their boats. Might appeal to people who like Lanterns: The Harvest Festival, another innocuous colorful game I don't much care for (but this one is a tad better).

This is a hidden gem of a game. The game is not widely known, especially in the U.S. since it don't have U.S. distribution. The rules of the game are very simple and can be taught quickly. Everything flows really well and the choices are very interesting. This seems like a game that will only get better with time.

A relatively simple game of tile-laying (the tiles represent boats on a floating market). The chance is present in the game, which places it on the lighter side but the way to score the tiles is nice and creates a lot of interactions (you compete for the places and you can really screw the other players' plans). I really like this game, but maybe it's also because I took it on a trip to Thailand and played there.

in this game you are a merchant selling goods in the floating marketplaces of Bangkok's canals. it's area control with set collection! 

the art for this game is spectacular, done by the same artist as the Harvest Trilogy.

RATING: 6.5
1 complete game, 2er, basic (non-tactical, luck-prone version), on Yucata.

An abstract (loosely themed) set-collection game with some interesting board play and scoring. Need to try the tactical version, because it seems the basic game -- probably an easier to learn the game -- is prone to reward the luckiest boat drawer! Still, the board play is kind of interesting, especially when it comes time to score and you need to figure out which spots to score and in what order, to minimize other players' ability to score their own meeples (by removing quartets from the board).

--- Summary ---
The board is a grid of rectangles divided into 4x4 regions separated by a somewhat irregular network of planks. You have a hand of 4 tiles, and a draw pile (in the advanced game, the tiles are separated into 2 groups by type, so you have some control when replenishing your hand). The tiles are rectangular boats: most show a type of good, 0-3 baskets and/or umbrella, and either with/without a merchant; a few others are specials (thief, inspector, cookshop). 

On your turn, place a boat adjacent to one already on the board, max 3/region. If no merchant there, place your meeple. If umbrella there, advance umbrella along track and score VP shown; if marker gets to one of the 3 scoring areas, pause regular play for Boat Scoring Round. Twice in game, my move your boat to adjacent location (still max 3 boats/region) after placing. Draw replacement boat at end of your turn. Thief allows you to take another boat (into hand or score pile) from thief's row; Inspector protects boats in his column from thief.

Boat Scoring Rounds: 
- 1st two scoring rounds: in order, x 2.
- 3rd scoring: in order till everyone passes. Then game ends.
To score, pick a spot on a plank (a corner space) that has 4 boats around it; all meeples there score VP = (# your meeples) x (total # baskets) (x 2 if cookshop is in the quartet). Then, claim one of your boats or a neutral boat to your score pile.

End Game Scoring: score for boats you've collected, based on type of good (fish, flowers, etc.). Each set scores with triangle progression (1, 3, 6, 10, etc.). Most VP wins.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
A bit too dry for my taste, placing-not scoring-placing-scoring... I know, there are a bunch of games that work in this way but somehow the placing does not appeal to me. The theme is nice, who wouldn't want to play a game on the floating market in Bangkok but it doesn't carry itself with the needed lightness. Maybe more plays will show me something I haven't seen so far...

This is one of those games that have nothing you can criticize. The rules are simple, straightforward and don't leave any questions open, the artwork is very nice to look at and very functional at the same time, the component quality is everything you would expect, it offers strategy, tactics and doesn't outstay it's welcome. Yet, this game fails to offer anything really memorable or exciting. All the ingredients where added into the mix, but the mix isn't more than the sum of it's parts.

Bangkok Klongs is a unique twist on area control. Boats are placed in harbor which both establishes the values for the various areas and allows you, usually, to place people into those areas. There are interesting placement restrictions which mean that a) not every spot can be taken and b) things have to chain off from existing spots.

Boats with umbrellas score bonuses depending on how far along the game is, but also force the game forward and trigger the three scoring rounds.

Areas which have four boats can be scored. When you score an area you can remove a boat of yours from the region, which is desirable as there is a set collection element to the game and boats contribute to different sets. Removing boats can also block your opponent from scoring, as areas can overlap and if removing your boat reduces an opponent's area to less than four they can't score it that round.

In the first two scoring rounds each player can score two areas and remove one of their own boats from each area after scoring. In the last scoring round you keep scoring as long as you can/want, and you can remove any boat in the area, not just your own (great for set collection and screwing your opponents out of scoring opportunities).

There are a few twists that throw a kink into strategy. There are special boats which will double the score for an area, thief-boats which let you steal a boat from the board, either to go towards your hand of boats or your set collection, and boats that steal the thief-boat/put restrictions on where the thief-boat can be placed. And finally every player can move a placed boat to an adjacent spot two times during the game.

There's more strategy going on here than at first glance. There's some tense dynamics as scoring one area may mean you're blocked from scoring a different area later. Sometimes you have to choose between scoring for big points or scoring sub-optimally to insure a tile for your set. Moving a boat or playing the thief boat can mess with everyone's strategy and radically change the position.

RATING: 3
My rating and comment is based upon the "family" version of the game. Looking at other comments I see that there is a "tactical" version of the game too. The tactical version would probably alleviate much of why I found this game uninspired and tedious- but I still think that even with the tactical change this game would never get higher than a 5 or 6 from me.

In Bangkok Klongs you have a lot of lovely, unconventionally shaped meeples that you play on boats as you place the boats on the board. This is basically a tile placement game where the boats are the tiles and the meeples are markers for scoring. The boats that score for a player have two types of scoring currency: (1) a set collection type, scored at the end of the game and a multiplier type, scored during the game. The trick is that wheneve you score, a group of four boats is scored at once and it is unlikely that all four boats are yours. Thus intra-game scoring is almost always benificial to multiple players. Given this scoring mechanic, the game is centrally a game of leeching. And leeching in a game structure is something I usually love! But my main gripe with Bangkok Klongs is that the tile draw (the boats that one places on the board)

Have just played it once.  But it played smoothly and everyone had a chance to win. Also flowed well and you have too many choices of what you wanted to do and could not do them all.  My only gripe is the very small country markers, that just beg to be lost.  Inventory them at game end and hope you can find any missing.

An interesting game that I want to keep playing. I couldn't figure out what was going on in the beginning of the game, but by the end I had it well enough to place second. True, the components are retarded, but the game itself is fun and easy enough to play after you get over the production values. I might have to track this one down.

Yes, the port markers are absurdly small; but that doesn't ruin an otherwise good game.

As Anthony Lazaroski said, it's like a nerdy/mathy version of Ticket to Ride (and I might add Airlines Europe), and that makes it interesting to play just so you can see what was in Alan Moon's mind prior to making TtR and AE: it's almost like Clippers is a deeper and mechanically better prototype. Unlike the other two games, there is absolutely no luck!

And that's what makes the other two games better overall: their luck element keeps them interesting, while Clippers sails through the foggy Sea of Analysis Paralysis. Having said that, this is the best game I have ever played (in terms solely of mechanics) where route-building is the core mechanism: but it's too dry to transform this good game into a great game.

Fun game, often quick, with a neat system.  However, the layout is confusing, the bits are too small, and the board lacks a scoring track.  It's also a bummer to pick one of the countries with the 8-point islands in the corner if the other player nations are nowhere near you.

A game I played completely wrong the first time and thought it was horrible.Imagine my surprise to find a devilish game of 'If I can't get my ports, you won't get yours'. It's a sly little game that surpassed my expectations. The only problem is the pieces are incredibly small for fat, fumbling, fingers like mine.

Clippers might be dismissed as an evolutionary step on the way to Ticket to Ride.  That would be unfair.  Placing  markers on routes between locations is about where the similarity ends.  Those route markers belong to shipping companies rather than players and there are unequal quantities of them, reflecting each company's potential to expand.  The players can extend routes of any colour.  How much of that you can do on a turn and how lucrative it will be is determined by a choice of different option tiles, rather than collected sets of cards.  The object is to link as many routes as possible to islands on which you own trading posts.  

Clippers constantly throws up difficult decisions; how far do I need to extend routes this turn; will another player extend that route in a helpful way; how soon will that company's route markers run out; how do I maximise benefit to myself and minimise it to my opponents; what needs to be done and what can wait?  For this I like it quite a lot.

The board artwork is pleasing, but ideally the playing area would be 50% larger to allow for larger port markers and clearer delineation of double routes.  The rules are clear and an easy read.

RATING: 7
Meant as a 100% strategy game.
Well designed components, except for the too small port markers. The fixed positions of 7 of these 12 markers also annoys me.
Nice concept, but could have been a lot better. I prefer Santa Fe Rails, because of the cards, which adds a greater fun element.

RATING: 5
Its a light family game about building shipping routes in the Southern Pacific Ocean. Each player has some ports on the board and tries to get as many shipping lines to pass through those ports. The rules are clear and easy to teach. There are no random elements in the game. This makes the game quite mathy and not really fun. The game works but I found it a bit dry.

{1 play, 4 players}  I'm not against luck, but the ability to place your ports on any available space is vastly superior to the card drawing in Santa Fe Rails.  Also, I never much liked the historical bonuses in that game and think the every-route-into-a-city-gets-money system here is better.  Plus, money doesn't dominate scoring as much (I've won SFR with as few as 4 city cards in play, which you could argue is neat because it's another path to victory, but for me, really goes against the whole geshtalt of the game)  Obviously, I think Clippers is the better version of this system... but, sadly, neither game really engages me for some reason.  Also, I can see how a 5-player game could really bog down due to analysis.  Still, a solid game.  Oh, and the teeny bits didn't bother me at all.

Similar to Airlines Europe, but just different enough to justify purchasing (for $10!). The 5x action card seems really powerful at first, until you realize that it's almost impossible to score points with it.

(5/7/10) This is an auctionless shareholding game does with action selection timing what most shares games do with auction valuation. Last two plays have been with four, and I don't feel that the game suffers at all.
And I've fixed most of the usability issues on my board by a) using a sharpie to make the one-way arrowheads more clear, b) replacing the tiny player counters with cylinders (not of any shipping line colors), and c) marking the double-lanes more clearly.

(Original)The game itself is phenomenal. But all the criticism of the components is warranted. I am no longer the bits whore I once was. But in this game the components get in the way of the game. Once a route goes down, it is near impossible to tell if there is space for another. It is always challenging to tell how many ports are allowed (although I just looked and all 3 and 4 point islands have two spaces, all 5 and 6 point islands except for American Samoa have three spaces, and the 8 point islands all have 4 spaces). The little counters are a joke. I replaced them with cubes from Notre Dame.

The game would get a solid 9 but for the components. And might still. What is so enjoyable? I'm not sure yet. I think I need to play again. But it has to be with the parasitic play where you are constantly trying to understand and manipulate incentives to get other players to do your work (i.e. get routes to your islands) for you. The game seems so simple, but then you are astonished by the variety of choices to be made on each move and how dramatically the choices each player makes affect the incentive structure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Really deserves a 9 rating, but almost dropped a bit, not  because of the bits (which are completely functional and acceptable), but because of fragility across player counts and across player comprehension.  In short this should only be played with exactly 5 players as it has severe problems with every other player count, and those players MUST pay attention and must fully understand the implications of both zero- and positive-sum exchanges.  Getting 5 such admirable players together at the same time can be difficult, however once you have that pairing the game shines brilliantly.

Nicely elegant game design, unusual for Alan Moon.  To some extent I consider this Alan's only successful design.  Somewhat AP-prone with inexperienced players.  Turn order is immensely significant, and effectively dominates all player decisions without there being any particular right/left binding!  As such timing and the incentive structures that drive the turn order timings and thus drive everything.  Easy to lose, hard to win perfect information game.  

While the similarities to Sante Fe Rails are obvious, Santa Fe Rails isn't worth playing (rating 4).  Clippers is very worth playing.

Surprisingly subject to emergent groupthink.  I like best the games where no routes reach the western isles.  Many groups seem to have never thought about this and rotely assume that of course the shipping lines will get to the 8 point islands.  Then I step in and start ruthlessly turning back every shipping line that approaches the middle of the map, driving ship and after ship into dead-ends long before it has run out of route markers, and they discover a whole new and much more interesting (and of course cutthroat) game.  Multiple players have described these games as the single most frustrating experience in their lives and have publicly wondered why homicides were not committed in those games as the red slowly flooded their face and their teeth ground into dust.  This is clearly a sign of an excellent game well played and this is a most excellent game when well played.

RATING: 9
For my play style, this is the game that "Ticket to Ride" should have been, and I can only wonder why the one is so popular, whereas you can buy second hand copies of this gem for $10 USD.  Why is it better?

1st, there are no cards to deal with.  The luck of the draw is non-existent, so you won't spend turns trying to bang your head on the table since you just can;t get that final card to complete your route.  Some might think that this would diminish the amount of tension in the game (since you aren't waiting for a card), but in effect it increases it because everybody can screw with your best laid plans whenever they want.
2nd, the variable powers granted by the tiles in phase one of he game allow for some interesting timing effects in the game.  However, I can see how the game might bog down with AP prone players as they try to maximize points towards the endgames.  This is the type of situation where I think hidden goals may have helped the game move along a little more briskly towards the end.  I know others would disagree with this is an otherwise luck-free game.
3rd, the ability to control the direction of routes is amazing.  Clever play can force shipping lanes to loop back around to islands where your opponents have a presence.  In effect, clever play allows you to box in players by controlling exit and entry points.  The designer has decided to give them an out with the port cards though, so they can get themselves out of these positions... but it will cost them.

I also went into this game thinking the criticisms about the impact of the graphical layout of the board must be overstated.  They are not.  Believe the masses, but the game is so good that you should overlook this particular issue.

Yep, all the criticism about the components is true, although it's not a big deal to take a sharpie to all the lines and ports, and use cubes instead of the micro-counters.  The gameplay itself is phenomenal. This is as cutthroat as it gets, and can induce AP, but the decisions to be made are really interesting, especially at higher player counts. When to go for speed, when to go for points, when to go for money, all while watching your opponents' delta benefits vs. yours. This is the archetypical zero-luck, low-rules, ultra competitive euro, and every gamer ought to play it at leat once. Hat off to Alan Moon, and please reprint this game.

+ Extremely interesting gameplay
+ The rules are so easy, they disappear after a couple of rounds
+ Short playing time

= Very cutthroat, you have been warned
= To play well, this requires constant calculations by the players
= It is a fragile game, one less competent player will influence the best laid plans

- The board graphic design and port counters are terrible.

Now, I am not quite sure why the game is so ill-regarded, but I found it to be a tight, interesting affair, with plenty of tension and fun decisions that were held back only by somewhat shoddy components. 

The game’s structure is relatively simple. The game takes place on a map of the South Pacific, where individual players take turns moving shipping lines across the map. Players get points for connecting to islands with a shipping company for the first time (in the form of money) and for how many individual shipping companies connect to islands where they have one or more ports, with different islands having different values. 

An additional wrinkle is provided by the special powers that are available for purchase at the beginning of each round. In the game’s default mode, individual players take turns placing one shipping route per turn. If you buy a special power it is possible to place down two and then get double value from any island chains that are connected to, placing three and getting nothing for connecting to an island chain, placing five (in one of the two phases), or to move a port. 

What makes the game interesting to me is how the game incentivizes players to disrupt the movement of the shipping lines away from the high scoring islands. By providing points for connecting to new island chains, players can work to disrupt other player’s plans without sabotaging their own chances to win, though they have to still weight the benefits of moving shipping routes to benefit themselves vs. moving them to hurt their opponents. Additionally, with certain island chains having different quantities of ports for different players, these decisions frequently end up being non-zero sum. You can easily end up in situations where moving a shipping company away from one player’s high scoring island chain will instead result in another player getting some points. Being able to gauge the deltas on these decisions is an important skill in this game, and one I find personally to be very engaging. 

The game plays best with five, but I have only played it with three so far. I suspect, that playing it with the correct number of players will open up new dimensions to the game that I am not able to properly consider now with only a limited view of the game. 

I have since played it with five, but that number is such a difficult one for me to meet (four and three are more typical), that this one rarely gets on the table. Even when we do have that number, other games tend to rise to the top. Rating lowered to a 7.

A very similar game to GMT Games Santa Fe Rails, both derived from the earlier White Wind game, Santa Fe. In Clippers players are trying to connect as many shipping lines to their ports as possible, via laying route markers across the board (think of roads in Settlers of Catan). Victory points are gained via these connections as well as via cash earned during the game. Essentially the same game as Santa Fe Rails with one important distinction - this is luck free as every player's ports are open on the map. In Santa Fe Rails, the "ports" are city cards that are gradually revealed during the game. The downside of Clippers is the production values - the "track" pieces cover up the double route lines on the board, and the port markers are ridiculously small.

Clippers is badly affected by poor component and board issues. These problems make the players likely to make mistakes and therefore feel unhappy with the outcome of the game.

I liked my first game of Clippers. Clippers was a nice surprise.

I heard some comparison with Santa Fe. I have played both games. I prefer Clippers than Santa Fe. Reason why I prefer Clippers more than Santa Fe is because Clippers has less luck and more calculations. It's has less random overall.

Clippers is beautiful to look at. It's a well balance game. There are a lot of different actions to choose from, each with their ups and downs. One thing I hate about Clippers is the port makers. They are WAY too small. Don't know what they were thinking! Just for that, the game losses a point.

Traded two copies of Clippers in two game trades. Still own one copy.

Only 'problem' (if it can be called a problem) is that the game also presents perfect information, which potentially leads to AP. No comment on Clippers can be done without a mention of the horribly bad components. The port markers ... good grief!

Better than Santa Fe, this has Moon's trademark route map of North America, masquerading here as the South Seas. The Clippers are better than the Junction cards, the wood sticks better than the cardboard rails. The cost of Options is okay, but the teeny weeny flag markers are toooo small. But the whole thing works well enough. It's a nice game, but not great. Worth picking up cheap if you get the chance.

A very good game; I haven't played its predecessors, so I can't comment on the diferences and qualities, but this game was great.  I can understand the problems some might have with the fiddly port markers, but we didn't find it a problem.  Simple rules, fast playing and depth of strategy.  Great.

I REALLY love this game, after just one time through.  I need to play it again soon.  The bits are tremendous (OK the flag markers are somewhat shmall -- keeps the board from getting too big), the board gorgeous, and the decisions each turn are painfully delicious.  This could easily turn into one of my favorites, with the right crowd.  There is a bit of a time investment -- it's a smidge longer than I usually like, but it has some tremendous payoffs.  It tooks us about 12 minutes to score the game at the end, but that was lovely -- we really got to savor what we had completed.

Oh!  We just came up with a cool idea!  We're going to make little flags that stand up as flag markers!  That should be wild...

RATING: 8
A solid, yet quite simple, market game. The market is driven by a simple track-laying mechanism that reminds me quite a bit of Stephenson's Rocket. Still, Clippers is simpler than Knizia's game but manages to remain very tense and exciting. The special cards allow for some very nasty road-blocking move... and it's good! I played with 2 players and it works well in that configuration.

RATING: 9
Try to connect as many of your trading posts as possible with as many shipping lines as possible. This is mainly complicated by the fact that you are often not the only player with trading posts on an island, and the other players will try to connect their islands and direct the shipping lines away from your islands in the process.

Clippers is a train game with ships. An individual player's influence is lessened a bit with more players but the amount left still allows for very meaningful decisions.

The trading post markers are seriously ridiculous, though. Their microscopic size clearly gives an advantage to the eagle-eyed under anything but perfect lighting conditions.

Clippers is as good as any light/medium connection game can be. Other than the starting ports, it's pretty low on luck and some easy-going flow. This game deserves to be new-editioned (as a simple reprint would cause others to have to deal with some very poorly thought-out components.) I'm interested in trying Santa Fe to see what the differences are. Anyway, a nice balance of trying to help yourself while thwarting your neighbours, but also capitalizing on your opponents' moves. The action selection mechanic also works. A game that most likely has been overshadowed by TtR, but deserves to be known. Not too sure about the replayability (it is kinda dry) but a good experience.

Alterations/House rules: We play this using different sets of poker chips for the VPs and money. We crossed the route markers to indicate a nearly hidden second and still unclaimed track alongside. There might be a tie-breaker, but it wouldn't be relevant to the game; ties are fine.

RATING: N/A
The poor manufacturing decisions (tiny markers, hard-to-see arrows, etc.) really let down what should be the best game in the series.

The biggest problem with Santa Fe Rails is the luck of the draw -- pulling a valuable city near the end of the game is far too rewarding. That Clippers removes all random factors should make it a no-brainer when deciding which version to play. But it's not and the reason is that it's just plain awkward having to deal with the production problems.

I expected another Union Pacific or Ticket to Ride knockoff but this is a bit different. I like that it ditches the tedious card drawing from those games, that's a huge improvement right there. The result is a much more pure route building game. Pretty good. The super-tiny markers are barely usable though. Bad component design there, though the production is reasonable everywhere else in the game.

Clippers is an interesting route-building game, with the bulk of the point scoring happening through connections.

Interestingly, my wife almost immediately called it "a train game," recognizing Alan Moon's trademark style, and also perhaps some of the theme carried over from the predecessor, Santa Fe.

Unlike Ticket to Ride, where grabbing a full connection to block or connect two cities is done in full, the critical connections here are (a) steering a Clipper towards a new island, and (b) reaching an island (and claiming any connection $bonus).

The limiting factor is that companies have limited Clippers, and new paths can only be started if you can purchase one.

But again, connecting to one's Ports is how the largest chunk of scoring happens, and each Port's value is determined by (c) number of Clipper lines connecting times the Port's base value (somewhat based on difficulty to connect). So your distant island with 2 Ports claimed and one connection may be worth only 8pts for each, where a nearer base 5pt Port with 4 Clipper lines might be worth 20pts each.

So the guessing games, and choosing the right time/place for each role, plus the priority in which to pursue them all come into play here.

Based on a 1st solo 3-player game (a fairly close-scoring one,) I'm starting this at a 6.75.

I think this is a nice game, but I'm not yet convinced Clippers is one of Alan Moon's best designs, and it doesn't have quite the elegance of TTR, UP/AE, or even Capitol to me on a first play.

RATING: 7
A train game (Sante Fe) re-themed as a sailing/trade route game, with the classic Alan Moon feel. It is not intuitively obvious at first, and the feel of the game play is clunky. Probably will require several more plays to fully understand what is going on, and then after that, it seems doubtful there is any re-playability, but that remains to be seen.

Players are trying to corral a number of shipping companies to sail in the Southwest Pacific towards a number of islands. The more distinct shipping lines touch specific islands, the more points they are worth for every port token they place on the island. Of course, there are a limited number of spots on each island, finite number of route markers, and space for one or two shipping lanes between each island. What is interesting about this design is that all shipping companies are not owned by anyone, but they are controlled by everyone. One player may establish a shipping lane, only to be redirected in another direction by another player. Players also have to balance between placing valuable port markers, versus selecting option cards that give them considerably more control in lane placement. 

Components are pretty good, except for the teeny-tiny circular port tokens which are about 3/16" in diameter. Rating: '7'.

Good game mechanics from Mr. Moon.  You can definitely see the common threads from his other designs.  Unfortunately, the experience is made difficult by a poor choice of components.  They're generally of good quality, but they just don't work well in practice.  The markers are too small, the double routes are difficult to see when one side has been claimed, the wooden clipper ships are too similar to the route pieces, and the circles into which you place the port markers on the board are very difficult to see because of color contrast issues.  These problems combine to drag down a "7" game for me to a "6".

It appears to be a game of strategy. I have yet to play, but like what I've read.

Now I&#039;ve played it.  My friend Brett feels that it _is_ just like S.F. Rails, but finds it disappointing that it loses the benefit of the historical bonuses.  I disagree.  The ability to chose and move your own ports outweighs the loss of the historical aspect.
I will continue to play both, as they are both excellent, and at times I would prefer to play with trains over ships.  :)

Clippers reminds me of a rougher/longer version of Chicago Express. Players are extending various sea routes (trains) to various islands (cities) where they have ports (stocks) utilizing different actions (engine dials) in order to do so. The game takes longer than CE and is more opaque/mathy upon scoring.

There are a few differences in Clippers favor however. I like the fact that BOTH your money and ports count as VPs at game's end (in CE your stocks are worth jack). This allows for more diversity in a players overall strategy wherein they can choose to focus on extending (any) routes purely for monetary reasons or ignore such quick payouts in favor of a long-term route strategy. 

People have complained about the components and they are indeed not the greatest bits in all of BGGdom. The port markers are insanely small, easy to loose and hard to handle. Much worse are the route lines, particularly the double lines. The single route lines could be a little darker and thicker but I can live with them. The double lines though are too close together and easily covered by a single shipping line, thus causing players to forget there existence altogether.

All that being said I rather liked Clippers and I suspect the game will be even better with more players (just like Chicago Express). My biggest fear is that it is too much like CE and in the end one of them will suffer in the # of plays department at the hands of the other.

Traded in a combo deal for Cavum, Chinatown, and Ingenious.

The better Santa Fe Rails. Although opinions were split in my group. Santa Fe Rails was deemed to be more fun while I prefer the lack of luck and the possibilities for planned mean play in Clippers.

The main difference is the choice in Clippers to place a destination marker wherever a player wants combined with a fixed setup. In Santa Fe Rails, destinations were randomly drawn. A few other minor differences give the impression that Clippers had undergone further development while Santa Fe Rails was published as handed in by the author.

The game itself is a 6. Neat development of the shipping lanes and trying to coordinate the shipping lanes with your ports. I don't care for how much the action cards can sweeten a player's action - the opportunities don't seem to balance out over the course of the game. Scoring is more work than it should be; I bet there is a simpler scoring system that doesn't change the results materially.

The game components are a 2. The tiny port markers are one of the worst game components ever. The lightly-shaded closely-spaced shipping lines are also difficult to see once the wooden lane start to get placed. Production on this game is a disaster, one of the few cases in which component quality actually detracts from the experience.

A very ordinary railway game (except on the sea!). Game is very simple, easy to learn and presents many tough choices to players throughout. Unfortunately its simplicity also means that there isn't much more to it than connecting trade routes to your cities. There just isn't anything else to do in this game. Overall its okay, but there are better rail games to be playing.

Components are really bad. Tiny, and I mean, tiny dots represent ports (about quarter of a hole-puncher's circle). The artwork on the board makes it hard to see double-routes and arrows when they are covered by the wooden bits. Also, its hard to see when the placement for ports has been filled up.

An admirable no-nonsense design sets the stage for constantly shifting interests, common and otherwise. Simple actions have subtle short- and long-time repercussions. No randomness, just nudging and toppling the game state in your direction.

RATING: 7
In my opinion, the gameplay of this Moon game is better than other offshoots of this similar system (i.e. Santa Fe) as the play is much more tight on the board with more difficult/agonizing decisions.  However, this game loses at least a point of ratings due to its horrendous printing and tiny port markers.  The board needs to have the trade route options marked in something other than light blue when the board base is blue as its hard to tell if its a single route or double route.  The tiny port chits are easy to lose and hard to see on the board.  This is very much a game where you help others as you help yourself.

Not a strong fan of Moon's games, but this one is particularly poorly designed.  It has been much improved in other newer iterations, but in this showing, the board is very user unfriendly (had my tactics derailed *mulitple* times when a "double" route magically turned into a single route upon closer inspection), the player port markers are worse than useless, they risk blowing away or easily getting bumped, and scoring is very challenging - the online player aids are an absolute must.

On our first play I was expecting it to be difficult to make your way to the left side of the board as was the case in Santa Fe Rails, but it was surprisingly easy.  I am not sure if I like this worse or better than the before mentioned game.  I will need a few more plays.

Enjoyable and attractive game of building (sea) routes and collecting goods.  Reminded me of Stephenson's Rocket.  The game has been criticized for the components, but if you can manage to pick up the tiny flags (aforementioned goods), it seems to me a solid game.

Very good open-ended strategy game. Simple mechanic that gives a great gaming experience. Comments on the tiny bits don&#039;t really give people the undertanding that the bits are actually more like microscopic, the only real drawback I have about this game. The port markers are a little smaller than a pencil eraserhead. I think the game changes alot as you scale it for 2-3-4 and 5 players. Must play alot to gain a sense of all the different strategies.

With replacement ports and lighting, this is a good strategy game.  The actions of other players add enough variability to a luckless game.  Money for connecting islands and buying the action cards might be a bit low compared to port VP.

RATING: 8
Definitely a lot less randomness than Santa Fe, which comes with its own pros and cons. The fact that you can see where all the players are trying to steer the clipper lines adds a lots of "brain-burness" to the game, but also adds downtime and removes tension. I also quite liked the hand-management aspect of Santa Fe, where you could draw several bonus tiles to prevent your opponent from getting them. However, in a way the end game is more satisfying, as your opponent won't be drawing a 20-point card on his last turn while you draw diddly squat. Overall, I preferred the "feel" of Santa Fe, but Clippers is pretty good too. Probably best with 5. Update: wow! Actually very fun with 2. Now I'm thinking it's better with less players than more. Would've liked the game to scale a little more for two players, with less "ownership zones" on the islands

Delicious game. The components are bad, but nothing that would stop me from playing. Developing the lines is interesting. The end seemed to drag a bit, but more active sabotaging of lines should fix that. Nice tension, the option/place a port choice is particularly tough at times.

I'd be interested in playing in person, but I can see how horrible dealing with the miniscule markers would be.

An interesting game from Alan Moon (Ticket to Ride etc). This time the players have to play with shipping lines and make them reach their ports to gain points.

Each turn you're presented with the option of going for instant points (taking a card that allows you to place more track and double your bonuses for connecting track to islands) or going for long term points (either placing a point-scorer marker at an island where at end of game you'll earn the island's points for each differently coloured track that got to the island) or take a card that allows you to build lots of track, but not much bonus, and drive the track towards your island markers. As multiple players can be on an island, some mini-alliances can form, or more likely some hold-off will eventuate as you each wait for the other person to extend the track there. Ideally you get to do turns that both get you double bonuses and move the track towards your islands. As such, the game is pretty simple and there's not much tension. The turns come around fast enough, but each turn is much like the other. Despite being set in the Pacific Ocean, it could be considered dry. The game graphics and components are sub-par, with bitsy island markers that you need to peer for and double track markers that can be hidden by a single track. It's all about the mechanics - the theme doesn't enter.

I love this.  I can't wait for my own copy (new or used) so I can pimp it up a bit.  Hopefully someone will reprint this great game.  May be a bit abstract for some, but I think the theme works with this.  Gamers must give this one a chance.  I enjoy the feel and look of the game, though the little bits need definite size upgrades.  If people can turn off the AP, the game can go fairly quick.

Pretty, but badly illustrated board for clarity.  I'd make decisions predicated on what I saw on the board, only to discover the information I perceived was not factual.

Ability to track one's progress during game and the scoring procedure at end sucks.  Took us 20 minutes and a spreadsheet to score endgame & not even convinced we got it right.  

Initial thoughts were I like the whole idea and mechanics here, but they're not executed well in the application & it makes me reluctant to play again due to frustration.  

UPDATE- played Claudio's copy with board more distinct through use of a Sharpie for directional arrows and 1 or 2 route markings, as well as replacing those stupid fucking flags with colored player cylinders. Greatly improved, although I would also use a Silver Sharpie to make it apparent how many ports are at each island.

Still- is pretty intense/heavy game that at the end is pretty much needing a spreadsheet for scoring. I'm not always into games like that. I think this is what makes Sante Fe Rails a better game for me, in fact.

A better version of Santa Fe rails.  Better because it is easier to evaluate your position and there is a limit to the number of cities/islands you can score (10).

Route planning and money management game which I would have been happy with just the restrictive placement options and resulting costs and payouts. Plenty of right brain considerations especially with the limited number of route markers and ships to allow branching off, as well as the limiting number of routes permissable by the board lines and directions. What spoils it for me is the numerical values of the owned ports to add together as well as multiplying of the number of different coloured routes to that port. Too much left brain for me.

Prefer Sante Fe Rails, I like the hidden appoach of the cards to the more declared approach by using port markers. However, I can understand why some people would prefer the open board.

Like how the game has a good trade off between short term payout - get to a port first with a line and longer term payouts having the more lines connecting to your declared ports.

RATING: 8.5
Tactical route building game in which you have to try to direct publically controlled routes towards your locations (in this case, islands).

FAR BETTER than the Ticket to Ride series! In this game, *every* move you make is--and feels--significant, unlike Ticket to Ride, in which most of the game involves drafting cards.


Elegant ruleset, no luck, perfect information -- a rarity in Eurostyle games.

Attractive board, horrible components. Replace the flag tokens with *anything* else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not really my type of game, though I can see the appeal for others, and I might like it better if I ever try it again.  However, even so, I dislike assigning different players non-symmetric starting positions based on a random draw, since it is very unlikely that the game can be balanced for each position -- and it sure seemed to me from the 2nd turn that the board was VERY unbalanced against the position I was dealt (the final score of about 200, 200, 190, 170, 120 was no surprise to me).

RATING: 5
Enough with the route marker games, Moonie. How many of these can you play? Not many, if you're like me and find games such as UP and TtR rather dull affairs. Nothing essentially wrong with Clippers, it's straightforward and there's a bit to think about. Found it difficult to calculate who was winning and the mapboard is not user-friendly. Regardless, no more route marker games for me for a while.

I was so proud when my girlfriend (now wife) first played this and said, "Wow, this is just a train game in disguise".  She's come so far.  

Anyway, this is a wonderful game that is nearly destroyed by horrific graphic design.  I might even give this a nine point five if the board where clearer and the components other than wretched.  This is really a great perfect information game.  I like the significantly different play strategies between the opening, the midgame, and the end game.    

When do you place your ports?  When do you extend the lines? Do you take advantage of lines for money or push them forward for position?  Easily one of the most underated games on the geek.

I glued all of the tokens onto the punch outs from Vino, and I'm planning to paint new lines and port circles on the board for them to stand out.  This game really should be on the table all the time.

UPDATE: I'm going to give it a 9 regardless of the awful bits.  I really love it.

Hmm.. okay.  I'm not clamoring to play this one, but if someone offered to play it and we did not have other options, I would probably play.  This game has to win for the worst set of chits in any game.  Each player has to manage port markers that are about the size of the head of a pin -- easy to brush off the table and lose in the carpet.  I thought the gameplay was okay, but according to the one teaching the rules, we played it with different strategies than those of his family and normal gaming cohort.

We view this as a Santa Fe Rails variant or expansion, and since I paid expansion prices for it, it most definitely is what I expected.

There are things about Clippers I like more than Santa Fe Rails, and things I like less. 

Pros:
- Port Scoring System
- Option Card system
- Branching system

Cons:
- Poor map design in terms of functionality (too easy to cover up both paths of a double route with a single piece)
- Port Components are too small
- Theme (should just be a train game)

Basically all my major gripes have to do with the publisher. The game system is excellent and in many ways improves upon Santa Fe Rails.

It's odd to see a mainstream game like this develop such Winsome-like themes of (very) temporary alliances and per-player scoring differential with each action. I suppose the jointly-controlled companies add to this. A great game.

Players create trade routes for 6 companies in the south pacific, taking advantages of certain bonuses to collect money for connect islands and points for owning port markers on the islands which have the most shipping lines connected. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Why have I just now discovered this game in 2011?  It plays like a good Winsome -- route building, temporary alliances, tradeoffs between cash now and position later. Fantastic. My only real complaint is that the far western islands are a bit too easy to reach with 2 (or potentially more) lines, even with one of the players trying to sabotage things. This makes the islands with a value of 3 (and except in fringe cases also those with value 4) fairly pointless. Even getting three lines running through those places isn't worth the effort and you shouldn't feel a moment's hesitation about running to an opponent-controlled 3 or 4 island.

Harry Wu must have played this 2002 Alan Moon game (with a unicorn and Bigfoot I presume) before designing Chicago Express as they feel remarkably similar. Both feature communal ownership of companies laying track as you strive to find something to do that benefits yourself more than others, and even the late-game emergence of a new, small, and potentially valuable company. Both very solid games, with fairly significant overlap.

Very simple and nice game. It goes fast and you always make new choices that depend on what other people do. Very clever game. Some people complaint about the components, but the little flags, can be easily replaced by cubes. the board is fine and I like it the way it is.

I am playing this after Northern Pacific ("Clippers boiled down to a ball-bearing-like essence" - Claudio Campuzano) and am a little disappointed. In Northern Pacific extending the rail is at most half the game, with placing "investments" being the other major part. In Clippers you start with a basic skeleton of investments already on the board (written in stone in the manual, meaning there could well be an imbalance against specific player positions), and the opportunity cost seems quite steep to place new investments or move existing ones, vs. steering the lines and trying to make money.

As a result, Clippers feels very tactical to me: Everybody's just trying to steer the lines in the right general direction, and you're not going to know what things will look like unless you count out the moves and know what everybody's thinking. And as there are more options players can take (particularly in drafting the special abilities), this ply analysis into the future seems much harder than in Northern Pacific.

I believe calandale said this is not ideal for soloing. I am guessing that's because each player is only making one small decision at a time before the turn goes to the next player, so you don't get a lot of time to focus on one player position.

I think with some kind of variant rules I could make this game more to my liking.

Beating Carl is always a noteworthy accomplishment, and made my first attempt at Clippers all the more exciting.  Interesting turn order, selecting bonus ability tiles, then acting.  Our game was extremely close (I won by 2 points 224 to 222 with Chris in the back.)  Glad to have tried it and will play again if the opportunity arises. Come to find out it's "Santa Fe Rails" at sea!

Wow.  Cool.  Route building.  Abstract.  I like this.  Phenomenal.  Tense.  Lots of strategical meat and tactical meat.  Shared incentives on the routes.  Not wanting to give up too much information.  Tensions of keeping vs spending money.  Get other players to do your work for you.  Make them work harder by turning the routes the other directions.  Fantastic game.  Turn order tactics.  Perfect information.  

*Reading online the complaints about the bits.  They are not at all a problem.  Do not let that turn you off of this game.

*played again.  this is an ASTOUNDING game.

*this is a wonderful wonderful game and is now a 9 for me.  tactics, strategy, teamwork, messing with other's plans, it has everything I like.  this might be my favorite game right now.

This was a running joke for a long time........i would bring this to game day and always say first, "Let's play Clippers!"  BUt we never did...months, years, decades rolled by.......until finally we played it and we all said, "Holy #$#@#$! That is a game with some class."  I lost by one point, and i can retrace my steps and i know exactly where i lost it..........problem with a game like that is, everyone wants to AP and make the perfect move, because there is a best move on every play. After repeated playes, we should be able to see this best move a lot quicker. 

Great game, beautiful to look at......the little circles, yeah, already lost two of them before even playing once!!! Don't know how........impossible really, but they are tiny little flag tokens that you could lose up your nostril if you breathe in to hard. I think mini columns would have been a better method.....even if they were just different color instead of flags......or columns with flags.  Moon's best game i have played.........oh, wait, San Marco? Didn't he have a hand in that........that was beautiful......I might have to go with San Marco by a hair.

With two strikes against this game-- terrible, impossibly small bits that make it woefully un-user friendly and hassle end game scoring that makes one pine for a laptop running excel-- it says something about how much I liked this game that I am still happy to give it a 9. Nail-biting tension, and the classic (wonderful) curse of way more that you need to do than you can actually acomplish each turn makes the game fun up until the last scrap of route has been laid. Clippers also gave me a real, and more natural sense of a playing arc than games that create that by having distinct (triggered) phases. The natural feeling of arc in a game seems rare, even a bit magical. I think in Clippers this comes from the progression of the values of the trade routes-- the natural growth towards more valuable territory as the game plays through the mid and end game-- and the limited supply of track. Watching the route suply dwindle ahead of your move as you approach your "8" territory is as painful a game feeling (in that heady gamer way of "oh $%^@$%^. OK, what will I do better next time") as I have felt in my last hundred games. And now add to the mix the ever shifting pressure of needing to sometimes shaft and other times cooperate with other players; from this quickly shifting, and often misjudged, (non-negotiated) alliance-making and breaking comes delicious and wicked player interaction. I like that! This was one of the rare games that I wanted to immediately play again as the first game was finishing. And I can think of about 100 things I'd like to differently in my next game!

Clippers is a fairly heavyweight euro about opportunity costs and optimization.  Most of the game is spent trying to find that perfect move.  The starting of routes in particular places can also make this game very confrontational, as players block each other, sometimes intentionally.

RATING: 4
Rated after the first play, this is basically quite abstract game. The ships are in back ground, this could easily have any route building theme pasted up. The idea is quite simple, but the pasted up theme does not help with intuition.

To add the insult, the components are not good. The office markers are tiny and the coins are not great either. The route lines on the board are quite thin and while some lines are single and some double, it is not always easy to see, if there is an unbuilt line or not.

One of my earlier choices for a "solid 7" game.  No luck but nothing I find innovative when compared to the other games already out there of this nature.  The Pacific theme is a nice touch.  Highly undervalued in sale price and you can often find this one cheap.

This did not grab me.  Mechanically it is a solid game, but it did nothing to pull me in.  

This seems very much like UP and TTR with many of the mechanics but it lacks the appeal of either game.

My personal first experience with Clippers has been one of a horribe explanation followed by a more and more interesting game that lasted too much.
Clippers has simple rules (when properly explained) and AWFUL components. Only a criminal mind can devise such small flags. it is very difficut to see where your ports are unless you are quite good in pacific geography (and the map is not very accurate).
The game , played in 5, is prone to An.Par. , you need to spend a lot of time looking for the best place where to put your ports, it is not well balanced in the beginning (unless we missed some rules).
All in a all a good playing experience but i don't feel like playing it again, unless it is with 3 players.

I liked the game, the mechanics, the enormity of my choices slowly closing in. I absolutely hated the tiny pieces that scattered to the wind with a slight touch. The game is missing a better mechanism for dealing with ports.

As surprising as it may be for me to say this, I actually do prefer the randomness in the card drawing in Santa Fe Rails over the perfect information of Clippers.  I like the hidden city agenda, the decision to play and reveal your choice of destinations now or wait until later to catch your opponents off guard.  I like having the short lines, they allow for more varied play and flexibility.  I like the tension of not knowing where the train may be extended to and what detour it may be taking.

To me Clippers felt like a very predictable game in comparison.  Coupled with a bland theme and an ungainly production design, I don't really see myself requesting this much at all.

My current favorite air game rules. Miniatures are used for visual appeal, but the system can be easily used with counters.

When I bought this game I hoped it would be the [GameId=237] of air warfare. Well, this is partially true. CY6 uses a clever and user friendly simultaneous plotting system. The Quick Reference Sheets are very well done.

It is not easy to predict your opponents movement. Escaping is quite easy, except when you are a slow plane. Yes, the game feels like a real air battle. No question about that.

Further I didn't like that I have to buy a lot of D4's for my Battle of Britain (BoB) game. What I also misses are guidelines to make my own scenarios with the planes that I have? The BoB Scenario Book wasn't of much value to me. In contrary to land and naval battles the individual air battles have little meaning to me. So a scenario generator would have been much appreciated. This also goes for the campaign game. A system where you have to play a series of generated battles that represents the BoB would have been nice.

Interesting game.It is somewhere in complexity between wings of war at lowest simplicity and whistling death, more complex. and likely more realistic. but check your 6 is still fun to play, and in my opinion definitively worth a try. 
after several plays this game is grown on me. it has replaced wings of war when I want to play a good, game but I still go for whistling death when I have the time to play a simulation. More recently changed to FLAC

Fast and fun WWII dog-fighting set. If you are a Wings of War: WWII Miniatures fan who can't stand the glacial production pace and enigmatic aircraft choices, you may want to look into this game. It's not a glossy production like WoW, but is faster, easier to learn (once you understand the maneuver chart) and an exprienced player can handle a flight of four aircraft without too much confusion.

Where this game shines is in the scenarios and campaign system. Air battles now exist within a context. Your decisions affect the air battle, which impacts the campaign, which impacts the resources and decisions made for the next battle.

Also, aircraft have significant differences in maneuverability and weapons that the WoW game simply has't reached yet. Better, the altitude rules are easier to master and it's possible to plan some real aerial acrobatics. (I've seen the difference in how both experienced and inexperienced players handle Zeroes and Wildcats, for example, and the difference on the table is amazing.)

All sorts of models and materials available in 1:300 and even 1:144 scale, too.

Short and simple. Trades realism for playability and focuses on piloting as the driver for maneuvering rather than plane specifications. Decent enough.

2013-12-24 : Produces a tense and realistic game, but pilot quality is such a determining factor that it overshadows the rest of the mechanics.

This game got me back into table top air combat.  Not too complex, nor too simple.  I have some issues with some of the design decisions made for speed of play and simplicity, but overall the balance is excellent.

Good game using the "Blue Max" system.  Only caveat is the rules do not consider altitude enough, but that is easily fixed.  Well worth the time learning to play.

meh...a good game that does it all in all the eras (with the expansion).  But, for some reason it just does not have the tense "action" I want from a game of aerial combat.

I have a love/hate relationship with CY6.  

As an aviation buff, I love getting the planes on the table, and the move plotting and shooting certainly has it's fun moments.

But...

The game has a lot of realism issues.  A few of these can really get in the way of good play, unrealistic split-s/immelmann maneuvers, intentional stalling to avoid being shot at, too-easy short range deflection shots, and no effective tailing rules.

Gives me the feeling of flying an airplane. The consequence of speed/turns/climb/dive. Very Good !!!

the "damn best thing" in aerial dogfight games! simple mechanics, a little distortion in the segmentation of movement and combat but fun and entertaining. 
a good compromise between "simulation" and "game". 
cy6 it's also a complete system: you have a plethora of scenarios in the game book, rules for bombing ground targets and a simple campaign. 
It has also a modern "sequel": cy6 jet age.

Probably the best air combat minis game I have played. The maneuver charts are the heart of the game and once a player gets that down it's a pretty easy game to play. The hard part is out-flying your opponent for a good shot. Some good scenarios are available in the expansion books. This WW2 version is better than the CY6! game for post-WWII air combat.

This is a bit of a complex title. I like the theme and concept and they cover a tremendous amount of aircraft but its just not my type of system. I think for the right person this title would be incredible, it is very well designed just not for me.

RATING: 7.5
Perhaps one of the better rulesets for creating a plausible --yet fun-- translation of aerial combat. Reminds me of Fight in the Skies, but with less book-keeping and faster combat resolution.

My only gripe rests with the "veterancy" rules in which more experienced crews get to "react" to others moves and adjust their move, resulting in ridiculously imbalanced gameplay.  House-ruled, it is a great game.

Love this game. It's like 3D chess.

A great air combat simulation but it just takes far longer to play then the actual air combat your trying to recreate. And a long set up and rules entry barrier. But its is still a great game and when i do get a chance to play i certainly will.

RATING: 7
Very good yet simple air combat. The only real problem I have with this game is everyone knows when you are out of ammo, this really changes how the game flows as everyone suddenly can throw caution out.
Also downrated from 8 recently as I feel there isn't really enough variability in aircraft abilities/specs. They all seem too similar. The saving rolls are also too closely spaced.

I've played a lot of Canvas Eagles in my day, but have never found a good WWII equivalent until I played this.  It's simple enough for someone to learn quickly and really gives me the feel of flying a plane.

My favourite air combat system

RATING: 10
Excellent air-to-air combat rules that focus as much on pilot quality as airplane performance. Love the plotted movement with Veterans and Aces capable of adjusting in reaction to lesser pilots. Tons of planes, and well supported with scenario books. Only complaint is that getting shots is extremely difficult outside of the rear arc. While this is certainly realistic, it leads to a lot of fights where aircraft run out of ammo and no one is shot down. Flexibility of the system--WWII and Jet Age--probably makes this my favorite air combat game overall (at least for now).

Like any successful game it balances realism and playability. I have only played small fighter vs fighter encounters but think the game will really shine as a series of linked scenarios or a campaign game. I like how different weapons are given different damage dice and grading individual aircraft for robustness and agility. Need to play more scenarios and want to try Korean War and Jet age as well.

A great game of WWII air combat that borrows heavily from Blue Max, an excellent set of WWI air combat rules.  Maybe it isn't as realistic as Mustangs and Messerschmitts, but it is clearly more playable!  The game is well-supported with campaign books and now, a jet age expansion.

RATING: 7
Good game, based on the proven Blue Max/Canvas Eagles game mechanics. Gives a good feel for WWII air combat, with just enough detail to keep it interesting without being a simple dice-fest. Loses 2 points for rules organization - a good rulebook should explain the rule mechanic before the variables, not after as this one does.

A very good simulation. Better pilots get better options in maneuvering. A very good, plot before move game. Better to play off the cuff and avoid analysis paralysis. More fun that way. Just react. Luck holds a good foothold and can be frustrating if you are a better player, but this isn't chess!

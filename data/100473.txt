The string lines are a nice gimmick, but otherwise the game didn't particularly grab me. Additionally, there was far too much downtime, but that could be down to the fact we played with 5.

Lacking the refreshing originality and quick play of String Railway and instead becoming a free-form Railroad Tycoon clone with the delivery of cubes to stations of the same colour and the analysis that comes with it.

RATING: 6
Players are attempting to set up an efficient railway network, and delivery goods across that network.  Players play five turns each, placing a string to connect up stations, then running goods cubes over the string (track), in order to get victory points. The quirky, fun game that was String Railway, is back in a more subtle and meatier version. A boundary string is laid out, stations and cubes sprinkled over the "board", and strings used as track to connect up the network.  The cubes delivery mechanism from Martin Wallace is here, making string placement a much more cerebral affair. Still fast playing, and totally fun. A curious gem.

A pleasant enough game, and it plays quickly.  However, I think I like Paperclip Railways a little more.

A cube pick-up-and-deliver, ala Steam et all, where strings replace the tiles.  There are only 5 very quick turns and each turn had lots of difficult decisions.  The string "track" laying, the placement of your "new city", whether to spawn new cubes, moving cubes as a block for others are all interesting, not obvious plays.  The scoring is based on diversified set-collection and destination tickets, similar to Ticket to Ride.  Great game for the amount of gameplay stuffed into 15 minutes.

Takes a delightfully quirky and fun concept and turns it into a worst drag I've played for a while. The rules are un-elegant to say the least, the gameplay includes some stupid, but basically mandatory loops you need to exploit, and the combination of long play time and bad downtime is just mind-numbing. You basically have 5 turns in a game that may well last 1 h 45 minutes with 5 players.

Probably better with 3 players, but I'm not really inclined to try.

Not surprisingly good, more like reassuringly good. It's what I hoped it would be.

Steam without the economics.  Scratches the exact same itch of pickup and delivery, but in a much more approachable form.  Easy to teach, quick to play, but really gets your brain working!  Loved it

update: Really wish I had this game! someone trade me or sell it to be at a reasonable price (in the US)

This plays like a short, supercute version of Railways of the World, without any math. My rating is based on playing without the white cubes and the long delivery cards, which slow the game down (cause AP, which the game is still somewhat prone to even without the long delivery cards) and don't seem to be worthwhile points-wise anyway. FYI, I haven't played the original String Railways.

Update: Now that I've played Steel Driver, I see that this game uses the same scoring mechanic. So it's this superlight Bouillabaisse of Martin Wallace train games.

A really fun fast playing cube delivery game. Can't recommend it enough.

Much quicker than paperclip railways (and more fun for me). 15 mins per player was about right.

Simplified and abstract version of Railway Tycoon. Though the theme is stripped away, we get a faster game with similar level of decisions and extreme replayability becaus of the random board setup. This game is also much more portable. Strongly recommended!

Initial rating: probably the best of the current 3 string games. I like the 'steam' mechanism of delivering blocks.

Don't expect a light game like the original String Railway. This is much heavier and longer. Less fun, maybe, but I really like this. Other people I play games with enjoy it much less.

Suggest.

First impression : I liked the idea of String railways. Now this game adds delivery of goods on top of that and it just doesn't feel good. In original game it doesn't matter that much if the strings don't go just where you planned because you're playing a fun filler. But when you're playing a bit longer game where you'd like to be able to plan stuff in advance it really annoys when the strings are just a bit too short and/or won't turn like they "should". By making game more serious they have taken away a big part of the charm.

Way too heavy and long, and lacking the fun. Nowhere near the ingenuity of the original.

I played String Safari and found it ok. I was allocated to play this one and basically categorize it in the train games family- since it is  a train game. This was actually a nice game. You only get 5 turns to do everything you can. You are placing track aka string to try and connect stations and deliver the goods. It is pretty abstract but kids could play it. It is one I find okay but never have to play again. I don't really like delivery games. :P It is no Yokohama, if you ask me... :)

A very unique game using string (yarn) as a railroad track. Adds pick up and delivery mechanics. Prefer this over the original String Railway.

Very simple track building and delivery game.  I'm more a fan of the original game as it was short and sweet and unique.  Where the original is absolutely different from other games, one can't help but compare this version to the Prairie Rails/Steam family games and it comes in a little short.  Still it is good fun, and uses an original system well and ranks as a quality game experience on its own.

I give the designer a lot of credit for some creativity, but laying down strings and trying to deliver cubes is just not going to work right in my mind.  The long routes were very difficult to obtain and the overall feel from the table was that it was too long for what it is.

Takes the string system from String Railway and adds a cube-delivery element, even locomotives to upgrade. Age of String, baby. Players now have 3-6 action points per turn, but there are still only five turns, so choosing when/whether to upgrade is tense and the game stays at filler length.

The luck of the cube draw is significant but there are still decisions to be made. I prefer it to the original.

Very nice train game. You use string as your railways. You have one long piece and several short pieces. Connect the station cards with the string and go pick up and deliver cubes. Works very well.

Ok game, similar to many others but at least the track building is quick. The only issue is the AP as players work out how to optimise their 6 actions , which makes it last too long.

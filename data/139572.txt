+ The bidding mechanic is neat and fresh; bidding with stuff that you actually want to get rid of turns a lot of your preconceptions on their head.
- While the mechanics are good, there isn't a lot of "draw" to this game.

Enjoyable auction game with a strange reverse bidding mechanism, where you try not to have too many rocks in your garden. You bid with rocks to get rocks and the fewer of them you bid the better.

Probably has a limited lifespan and lead to AP in our group, but worth a play or two.

While it's nothing incredible, it's a very good counter intuitive push-your luck auction game that plays very well with 6. It's also easier than most auction games for noobs to figure out what a reasonable bid is. Rating raised to an 8. I think it's a keeper

I only managed to get one play of this in and even then it was only a three player game, so I'd really like to play the game a few more times before making an ultimate judgement. Unfortunatly it fell pretty flat with one of my game groups...

The rulebook is a little wonky and could do with some further clarification, most specifically with the bidding process.

The bidding mechanism in this game is somewhat novel, and actually seems to come with a sort of life lesson built in: no matter what you do, you can never get things completely clean for long.  I do dislike the random nature of which penalties get applied when, and I dislike that someone has to take a random stone each turn.  But these are small complaints.  If someone wanted to play, I wouldn't object.

A lovely abstract that I can never get to the table. Very pretty and love the components. Considering dismantling...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The design is excellent and the components are unique, well-conceived and of a high quality.
The idea is that you bid against other players to get stones needed to fit together in what are essentially sets of runs.  Problems are: The bidding tension is not that high if the players have different immediate goals.  Those goals are limited to only 4 types of configurations as objectives.  Finally, putting stones together as I / II/ III / IV OR II/II/II may not hold players' attentions for that long.
Bottom line - design is excellent however game play rules may benefit from an enhancement or expansions.

2012 Ion Award winner (under the name Rocks)

Reimplementation of [gameid=16389], originally played with Icehouse pieces - see comments for that game.

Interesting and quirky auction game, somewhat abstract and somewhat cut-throat, but surprisingly fun because of the mechanics of reverse bidding and anti-set collecting.

Does the game last too long with larger numbers of players?  Needs to be played fairly quickly to work best, if it goes 90 minutes that's too long; not good with AP players, and ensure bidding starts fairly low.

Some consider the variable ending a bad mechanic, but I think it has the advantage of turning the last part into press-your-luck style game, and keeps it tense.

This a vicious game of bidding where you're trying to place rocks in your zen garden in a way that doesn't incur demerit points from the head monk.

Each turn you bid on sets of rocks or pass if conditions allow. You're bidding rocks you want to get rid of but the catch is the lower bid wins and bids of 0 are allowed.

Only one player may pass and only if all sets of stones have at least one bidder, so it's not always a choice for you. If you do pass, you take an auto -1VP but that may be favorable to the other penalties you'd incur.

And that's because those people who "win" a set of stones must add them to their board and then check the monk's conditions. There are three conditions always in play that incur penalties, such as having three 2s of the same color. Thing is, the penalties for these three conditions increase. You may be sailing along perfectly and then take -5VP in one bad turn.

You can see which sets of stones you really don't want and so can other people so you try to force people into buy stuff that's really bad for them. Brutal game.

Karesansui is a nasty little auction game with low-bid auctions causing much gnashing of teeth. While not quite as nasty as Neue Heimat, Karesansui holds its own in terms of screwage which is quite funny given that Karesansui refers to the tranquil Zen stone gardens. I used to play its predecessor Undercut a bit, but the board game version has such a lovely presentation that I prefer that version instead.

RATING: 4
Unique bidding game or set avoidance where you bid with the rocks themselves that make up the various sets. Theme is well integrated. The down side is that the bids always ended up very low and a lot of the time was spent getting to that point which was rather uninteresting. Also, some of the decisions can be AP prone, slowing down what should be a quick game. I like the innovative take on bidding few points or same points with fewer rocks coupled with the set avoidance, but ultimately the experience itself was not all that interesting.

RATING: 3
Fun in theory, but there's not much of an arc; when you're punished for stones they vanish, leaving you probably safe for a round or two. I could imagine it being better with 6 and with a computer telling you exactly how bad each parcel would be for each player, to really play people off against one another and other auctiony stuff. But realistically, I'll never play that game and probably shouldn't this one credit for, in my imagination, being related to it.

RATING: 6
"The cutthroat game of Zen gardening!"

An interesting mix of kind of "anti-game" rules. It's anti-set collecting, where getting sets costs you negative points, and anti-bidding where the lowest bid will get you what you want (but force you to keep things you don't).

I'm very intrigued by it, so would happily play again. However, I don't foresee it having much long-term staying power. 

UPDATE: I was able to play this one again, and I liked it fine. We had an essential rule wrong the first time we played, so that helped. I agree with my earlier judgment that it won't be a long-term favorite, but it's quick, simple, and quirky enough to be worth playing. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Mechanically, this is a simple auction and set collection game. Thematically, it is about making a rock garden. While my only experience with such things comes from cheap plastic desk sandboxes, I've always found it to be kind of fun, maybe even therapeutic. 

For such an abstract game, Karesansui does a remarkable job of replicating this experience. The mechanical twist is that instead of collecting sets and making patterns, you are trying NOT to make sets and patterns, a task that becomes more difficult with each rock you are forced to add to your garden. This forced chaotic arrangement feels positively, well, zen. 

As family games go, this one seems just right to me. There is a bit of a learning curve, perhaps even fighting with the mechanics themselves, but partway through the first game you should find yourself pretty comfortable. Worth playing a few times for sure.

RATING: 8
Good auction game that seems to scale well to 6 players.  I have played twice with 4 and the auction mechanism has been very interesting each time.  Beautiful components, fast play time**, and simple game play make this a winner.

**AP prone or min/maxers could negate this significantly.

RATING: 4
I didn't really get it at all.  It's a Vegas Showdown-style simultaneous auction game, except they are dutch auctions, except your currency is harmful so you want to bid as high as possible.  So every round amounts to the first 3 players put all their rocks on a bid, then the 4th player undercuts by 1, then they take turns undercutting each other until all are bought for like 1-2 points.  Unless the players by convention start lower, but strict players should insist on playing it out every time.  Ugh- unpleasant and trivial at the same time.  And talk about no thematic integration!  Why are you bidding using the same thing you bought in previous rounds?  There is no real-world situation where that makes any sense.  Oh yeah, and the negative set collection scoring is incomprehensible too.  Why not reward players rather than punish?  It's a "twist" that is actually just a bad design decision.  I don't get this game at all!  Reastically, I feel like a bit of a shill giving a 4 here- its quite generous.

Played without the weeds expansion, I want to give that a try next time.  One bids sort of like a dutch auction where lowest bid wins the rocks (using own rocks to bid) to add to your rock garden.  There are three types of patterns which score points (you are trying for lowest score) and removes said rocks.  Penalty points increase as the game continues.  With one less auction lot than players, players keep bidding and reducing bids until one person passes at which point everyone gets their rocks.  I found the game interesting and want to play again but with the weeds expansion included.

This is one of those games with a peaceful, relaxing theme (you're trying to remove unsightly rocks from your rock garden!) that ends up making everyone call each other names that would make a sailor blush. Several times during play you will be willing to straight up shank a guy for underbidding you on the only set of rocks that doesn't give you problems. Plus you get to call people "insolent", which is always a plus. A nice twist to the pure auction genre.

Far less serene than the theme might suggest, this game is a cutthroat reverse auction where you're trying not to be the worst rock gardener.

Not my favorite auction game, but not one I'd turn down the opportunity to play again.

Karesansui is an interesting inversion of a standard auction game. Instead of collecting sets, you're trying to avoid making them. Bids are with existing items, which you want to get rid of, and so the lowest bid wins.

This rating is prone to change, as I'm wondering if the reverse auction mechanic is really novel enough to warrant it. Nevertheless, the initial play was quite interesting. I think that it's not just that it's a reverse auction, but also that you're bidding with the same stones that you're collecting that makes this fascinating. Also, I have to give them credit for a pretty novel theme.

RATING: 8
I was so positively surprised by this inconspicuous looking game and ended up loving it. it is a bidding and set collecting game with a reverse effect: you try to have the least points against you, the least demerits, meaning the lowest bid will win (but you want to try and get rid of as many of the rocks as you can) and the getting a set will gain you points, more points the more the game progresses. This effect is great and cause you to rethink your strategy several times during the game. Highly underrated game!
Additionally, I have to write a note to myself: you keep on saying you don't like bidding games and then you end up liking them anyway which maybe means that you do indeed like bidding games!!

A family strategy game with a pasted on theme. Where have we seen that before? But that doesn't have to be a knock on the game (for me at least). The rules are simple: whoever bids least for a bunch of numbered, colored garden stones, bidding with those same numbered, colored garden stones, gets the new set of stones and gets rid of the stones he bid with. The trick is not to have 3 stones in the same color with different values, 3 stones in the same color with the same value or 4 stones with the same value but different colors. Those combinations give you points. Whoever has the last points wins.
Even during the first round we felt the game was a bit tedious as you will want to bid as high as possible to get rid of as many points as possible, but that just means the bidding down process takes longer. Tedious. You could of course start lower right away, but then you run the risk of bidding less than you could have just for the sake of winning time. Not the best strategy. There's always one person who has to pass and he automatically gets one point and keeps his stone. This adds a nice choice to the game once the bids start getting low. But it's not enough to keep my interest. It's very, very abstract and repetitive. It just lacked any sense of fun for me. You can't say the game is broken, but the utter lack of fun ruins it. On the BGG scale (which I don't use) I would have to rate this a 2.5

Initial rating: 5/10

Karesansui is the exciting game of Rock Gardening. Where you try to make a rock garden that ideally has no rocks.

Each round piles of rocks are assembled with one fewer piles than players. Then players bid rocks from their garden on one of the piles. As rocks are generally bad for players, the lower bid wins. Bidding is a great way to get rid of your rocks if you can manage it without being undercut. The bidding round ends when someone decides to pass rather than compete for one of the piles. Passing earns you a demerit (negative victory point) and a random rock from the bag.

Then everyone collects the rocks they "won" and places them into their garden. Rocks are placed in your garden according to a grid based on their color and the number on the rock. If you have 3 rocks in a single spot, rocks in three spots in a vertical column, or rocks in four spots in a horizontal row then you have to take a demerit card from the appropriate pile. The piles have cards numbered 1 through 10, so each further infraction is more painful than the previous. The benefit of gaining demerits is that you can discard the offending rocks.

After the fifth round a black rock is put in the draw bag. The game ends when the black rock is drawn or if any demerit pile empties. Whoever has the fewest points wins.

The game has an unusual theme, which I like, and there was some interesting gameplay, but overall it didn't really click with me. I wouldn't terribly object to playing it again, but I can't see getting excited about doing so.

A thematic game, with nicely produced components, about placing rocks in your Japanese zen garden.  You'd think however that the rules would actually clearly tell you how to place rocks in your zen garden...  
I read through the booklet a couple of times, and then had to piece together what I'm pretty sure are the rules: 
Rock value - The dash marks on the rocks. From 1 to 3. When drawing from the bag to fill wedges in the bidding board, continue drawing until the total value equals or exceeds 6. 
When placing the rocks won from bidding in your garden, they must be placed in the horizontal row matching their value. 
Colour - When placing the rocks won from bidding, they must be placed in the vertical column matching their colour. 
Therefore a rock must be placed in a certain spot corresponding to its value and colour. 
Ok, so now that that's sorted, can someone please tell me how the blank sides of the garden boards work? Can you literally place rocks anywhere as the rules seem to suggest? They hint at an advanced game, but I can't see how it could possibly work - demerits would never be earned. *shrug* perhaps I should meditate on it...

A gift from Gina for Christmas 2014. Thanks Gina!!!

I love the production value of this game.  Beautiful stuff and its fun to fiddle with your rocks to make your own peaceful and unique rock garden.  And that's good since this game can get a bit thinky.  Combining paying for your auctions with the items of the sets you are trying to collect would be hard enough... but turning everything on its head where you try to bid the least and try not to collect any sets takes a while to work out.  I found this fairly enjoyable but quite a few people didn't and when it had trouble getting to the table I traded it on to a better home where it could get played more.

Incredible.  I'm speechless.  So many amazing puzzles and moments.  

Favourites were : Nefertiti's Game, the "blueprint", and place the "11".

One puzzle was too obscure, but other than that, fantastic.

It took a little while for the dynamics of this game to sink in.  I'm sure the next one will be smoother.  The puzzles largely seemed medium-to-hard for me.  A couple of the puzzles were pretty out-of-the-box, but I kinda appreciated them doing something along those lines.

You must solve a series of riddles and puzzles to escape from a room. Each correct solution brings you to another riddle. How fast can you escape the room? This game can be played only once, because you markup, fold, and tear the game materials.

It was a fun play, though I am down on the destructive nature of the Exit series of games. I may try a couple of the others if I find them on sale, but will likely stick with Escape Room: The Game and Unlock! for the escape room type of games.

RATING: 5
Although the game system is interesting and may have potential, I got really frustrated with a couple of the puzzles, specially after checking the clues and finding that it had nothing to do with logic. It was a bit of a disappointment, specially since you can play only once, so now I can't shake off this frustrating feeling.

RATING: 4.9
I'm very tempted to rate this a 1, because this is not a game. Still, as a gaming experience, I'll compare it to other experiences and rate it more fairly.
I have the experience of successfully escaping from half a dozen well-designed real life escape rooms. This game doesn't even begin to compare. The initial ramp up for this game is annoying - particularly the very first puzzle; your expectations for what to do and how to use the materials at hand do not bear out. Once you've solved 3-4 out of the 10 puzzles in the game, things speed up and mesh together reasonable well. I'm reasonably impressed by the variety of puzzles contained, given that it can't make use of lights, sounds or smells like a real escape room.
The game booklet and cards are really too small to be looked at by more than one person at a time. As such, I wouldn't recommend the game for groups larger than 2 or 3 players.

Extremely annoying that this game makes you destroy a very few of its materials, where it could relatively easily have avoided doing so. I myself couldn't have played it again, but I might've wanted to share the experience with a second gaming group.

Very well made riddles for a really fair price. Chained riddles without any connected plot just isn't my cup of tea. I prefer stuff like Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective when I like to puzzle in a group. Also I found part of the riddles where you had to discover tiny little symbols a tad anoying.

RATING: 5.7
First game of the EXIT series. High hopes after a somewhat fiasco-ish experience with Unlock. It is not as stres inducing as Unlock (since you can take your time and finish the game well after 1h, which is usually the limit in escape rooms and like minded bgames). The physical part of the game is quite a step-up from the pure card-driven mechanism of Unlock. 

POTENTIAL SPOILERS:
But it is true that some riddles took it too far regarding what you can consider as usable material, that made the whole experience feel way too detached from reality: you are supposed to be in a tomb and the only things you have is a gadget and a diary (it says it specifically on the intro of the game - trying to increase how thematic the game feels?!?), yet you end up having to use things that have no thematic/logical place in the tomb. 
SPOILERS OFF

That kind of ruined the final verdict on the game for me. That does not turn me away from the game though, since it showed potential and I am looking forward to try the other installments.

The Pharaoh's Tomb was my first foray in the Exit series, having already played three Unlock scenarios and one Deckscape scenario.
This one started very slowly, with the group trying to dive into the mechanics, and having some difficulties due to a debatable translation/adaptation in italian.
Going on, the scenario grew on us, and I must say I was amazed by a couple of very clever puzzles.
We finished in almost two hours: a very poor performance, but definitely a fun one!

RATING: 5
Abandoned Cabin had a couple puzzles that broke the theme, but also provided some puzzles that conveyed the feeling of being in a similarly themed escape room. This one included the theme-breaking puzzles and failed to provide one puzzle that felt truly thematic. Basically, we felt the puzzles used too many gimmicks and had the appearance of a random collection that was given an Egyptian overlay. The instructions should have informed you to have a marker-type writing utensil, too, as opposed to the pen or pencil you're likely to grab. The production made another puzzle strain the eyes too much. While we finished this one ten minutes faster than Abandoned Cabin (probably because we were more familiar with the types of puzzles used in the Exit series), we enjoyed our time much, much less with this one.

Also, unlike Abandoned Cabin, I don't think there is a way to avoid destroying components in this one.

Another excellent entry in the series. I love the theme on this one and a couple of the puzzles do a good job of integrating the theme. This one had at least two standout puzzles that will just be really fun to discover the answers. My group of 4 took almost two hours of complete this and aside from a few puzzles we got stuck on and needed hints, we were never bored or disappointed.

RATING: 7.1
Played on my own. Bit too hard for me, it's clever but got me all looped up and frustrated. Mostly " but of course!" moments and not enough "yes, got it!". But that's down to me, and am guessing playing with more people would have made a difference.

RATING: 4
Some of the puzzles are so far fetched its just dumb.  As in, so dumb that if someone applied to work at your business and described how their logic worked, youd kick them out immediately. 

Its hard to make a game. I know this. But what they have hoped was cleaver is, at times, a gimmick.  For example of the kind of logic, imagine it said "you need to find a red apple" but what they want to you find is the receipt from when you bought the game.  Yeah its an apple because you can ball it up into an apple-ish shape and use marker to make it red. Thats the kind of logic they use at times.

RATING: 7.5
(SPOILER FREE) The last of the initial 3 of these exit games was good, and had some clever puzzle solutions just like the other 2, but it had a couple puzzles that even after figuring it out I was a bit befuddled as to the means to get the solution, and there was one that I outright disagreed with the clue/solution combination. 

Still it was very fun and I'll gladly get any other EXIT games that come out in the future.

Obviously, these escape games are a one-shot deal. There were some clever puzzles in this one, but some were more "meta" that I would have preferred which broke the theme a bit. I'll leave it at that without spoiling anything. Also, progress is very open-ended, so we did get stuck a few times with no obvious ways to advance. Still was a fun experience which I would recommend.

One big beef I had was the fact that you have to draw on/rip up various components to complete the tasks. Normally I wouldn't mind, but there are only about 2-3 puzzles out of 15-20 that require this, so I feel like the designers could have easily tweaked the game so that it could withstand multiple plays. Maybe include multiple copies of the cards you end up drawing all over? I hate to toss this box after one use which seems like a money grab since it wasn't necessary in my opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The puzzles were good but as it was my first escape style game some of the stuff was not clear. Maybe other exit games are better for first timers, I need to try them out. When I used help it was clear to me that the two of us would not have solved it without the help :)

Probably my favourite in this trilogy of games, although I hope there's more in ththe future. This was probably the most difficult of the three, without any of the tasks and puzzles feeling arbitrarily time consuming. Felt a genuine sense of satisfaction after finishing this one, rather than just enjoying the ride - although I would easily recommend all three no problem.

Puzzles were either too easy or too abstruse and clues were too cryptic in this one: you either got it right away or banged your head against the table for 20 minutes. The fact that there is only one book means that only one player can look at the puzzle at a time, which means others just sit around doing nothing. We really didn't like this one, even though some of the puzzles were satisfying. I far prefer the Unlock series to this.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS FOR THE 2017 EXIT SEASON 1 SERIES:[/b]

++ Great and more challenging puzzles with a more tactile feel to it (don't hold back cutting, folding and physically alter the material), with some out-of-the-box solutions and some "Wow!" moments.
++ Great and unique code dial for the riddle solving so you don't need anything more than what is included in the box (apart some pens, papers and scissors, as indicated in the rule book).
++ Good card-based hints system (using 3 cards for each riddle, the first stating what you need to have to be able to solve the riddle, then the second hints to help you think about the solution, and finally the solution as the final hint, for you to continue your progress through the game)
++ It's great that if you are using a hints that didn't help you because you already knew this, that this hint is not counting against your final score (unlike Unlock).
++ The destruction of the components, although a negative "value-wise", enable the games to have some cool and refreshing puzzles that couldn't be done otherwise, and this feature is well used in this game series.
++ Easy to pick up and learn, as the code solving wheel intuitive and smooth to use.
++ Good artwork.


:thumbsup: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS FOR THE 2017 EXIT SEASON 1 SERIES:[/b]

-- Destruction of component is mandatory so you cannot pass along the game when done (so it's a "lesser" value game in the end, but you still get enough for your money IMO). You can do without destroying the components to a certain degree if you want to copy some part of the game, but it's way less fun IMO.
-- It's a one-and-done game. But hey, every escape room game are (board games or the real deal).

Out of the initial three EXIT: The Game scenarios, this was my favorite. They do a very good job of imitating the Escape Room experience. After escaping from an Escape Room I usually have a state of euphoria, which these games managed to duplicate very well. The theme of this one was the most fun and most interesting to us. Usually you can only solve one puzzle at a time though so I think having 6 players is quite ambitious and believe even 4 might be pushing it. We completed all of them with just two, admittedly not getting very good scores. I do look forward to more in the series mostly because the price is very affordable, even though you typically end up destroying the game through the process of playing it.

RATING: N/A
Note: Rated an 8, but I just decided to rate one of them rather than every game in the entire series.

This provided a truly excellent escape room-type experience that was really engaging and fun throughout, with a few neat and unexpected twists along the way.

Lots of fun puzzles, at a good level of difficulty for the gaming crowd. This particular one seemed the hardest of the first three, with lots of really clever but hard to figure out easily things.

As an experience, it's probably a 9 in terms of the fun I had and how much I look forward to playing other games in the series, but it feels a bit odd giving it any more than an 8 as something that's one and done after about an hour. A fun hour though!

RATING: 7
If you're looking for a good escape room in a box, this is well worth the purchase. The price is GREAT, the puzzles are quite good, and it's a fun experience all around. Better than a real escape room? Nah. Better than the vast majority of escape rooms in a box, though - second only to the Escape Room: The Game series.

The first one we played. It has the coolest "AHA moment" of the three, though it's probably my least favorite overall. Still, it's on par with the other two.

RATING: 4
I'm sorry I cannot rate a game highly that you can only play once. What a waste of packaging if nothing else. So my goal when I play it will be to make sure that I can pass it on when I'm done, just to spite the publisher ;)

Edit now that I have finished the game: I played it solo and actually enjoyed it, even though it was very difficult to play without looking at clues. Because it first I was lost because I had no idea if I was supposed to be giving a place to start or if I was missing something about what to look for first. So I think I had to look at a clue, but eventually I got to understand some of the game makers style. Although there were some places where I looked at the clues just to make sure that I was on the right track when I felt lost, and I usually was. The mechanics are actually very good, and you do not have to tear things apart or write all over things. As long as I had a pencil, scissors, scrap paper (tracing paper would have been a bonus, but I made do without it) I was able to solve it without marking up or ruining anything. There was one place where it said tear out the page and that was completely unnecessary. So I didn't do it. And it worked fine. There was another place where I was supposed to tear something up and instead I made copies of it with scrap paper. And there was another where I was supposed to draw over some characters on a card, but instead I just recreated the grid and colored in the boxes on my sketched out grid instead of ruining the card. If I had had a photocopier or a printer with a copy function nearby, that would have taken care of those much more easily. So I recommend that. I will play the other games because I think it is fun and the price makes it worth it. But it's also good to know that I don't just have to throw it out when I'm done, I can pass it along to someone else who can be creative and pass it along without ruining it.

The one other thing I had trouble with was in a part of the game where I had to find some letters written somewhere, I had to have a magnifying glass nearby to see some of the Clues. And even then it was almost impossible to read the letters. I just had to kind of guess the positions of some of them and it worked out. But it was very frustrating. I even asked my teenager afterward if it was just my old eyes, I'm 49, or if he would have been able to see them, and he couldn't see them at all until I pointed them out and even then couldn't see about half the letters. So that's a problem and I think it's poorly printed. Hopefully they received enough complaints about that that it is fixed in future boxes.

I hate it that the game isn't designed resettable! It is unavoidable for such escape room / riddle games that you can only play them once yourself. But they could have designed the game so that you can give it to other players afterwards. They would only need to make some destroyed key parts downloadable at their website. That's what the publishers of [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204836/escape-room-game]Escape Room: The Game[/url] do. So my rating includes a sizeable penalty for this game because their publishers don't do it as well.

As for the riddles and the story in this particular edition:
- The riddles are fine.
- However, the story is completely illogical, which prevents a thematic immersion. (Who was the person in the story that actually set up the riddles? Some pharaoh? Or the guy who wrote the notebook? Both possibilities don't seem to make any sense.)

We had to get the final clue for maybe half the puzzles, but for all but one of them we felt afterwards that we should have gotten. Still a ton of fun for the price-point, and amazing how well they did which such a small package. The only thing that was non-ideal was the small print, but I'd rather deal with that then have to throw away twice as much material when finished. The small print and the typical one-puzzle-at-at-time nature makes this better for small groups. Caveats aside, most highly recommended! Can't wait to try the next two.

My first foray into the series. This...was AMAZING. Certainly not for everyone (you probably already know if this is your kind of activity or not). I know I certainly couldn't have figured it out most of the puzzles without help from the hint cards, but my wife and nephew were dialed in and it was sucg a great joy to watch the light bulbs go off in their heads as they each had their "a-ha!" moments. In fact, there were at least two OMG! moments in this one that were totally worth the entertainment price of admission alone. If you enjoy escape room stuff/coop exercises, definitely check the EXIT series out. I'm looking forward to the rest of them.

RATING: 7
I have never had the privilege of experiencing an escape room before, but have always wanted to.  The fact that this game is a "play once and done" deal made me hesitate at first, but hearing so much good about the game helped to change my mind and decide to buy it.  I was quite surprised at how tricky some of the riddles were.  The first time I tried with a group of 6 people didn't go well.  Too many bodies trying to see info, and it just got muddled.  I packed it up after an hour, and only solved the first 3 or 4 riddles.  Fortunately, I was able to give it another try, this time with a group of 2 others (3 total), which I think is a good number of people for the size of the information you will be searching/sharing.  All in all, I really did like the experience, but I'm not sure why I don't feel like jumping in to another exit room game right now, so I can't say it was a favorite of mine.  Solid game, though. . .

RATING: 3.6
This... is not good. Granted, this is my first run at this series, but I won't be back.  A couple of the puzzles were absolute stretches.  For those, I eventually looked at the solution card and was disappointed because I just didn't feel like those were solvable by most people.  Every other puzzle was almost too easy.  In other words, there weren't any good, clever, challenging puzzles.  The Unlock! series is leaps and bounds better, though that series has faults of its own (game-breaking at times).

We are big fans of Escape Room style games. We played EXIT: The Game - The Secret Lab and loved it. My group was really excited to try this one. There were two puzzles in it that we absolutely hated.  The first of those just put everyone in a sour mood and ruined enjoyment for the rest of the session. It's unfortunate because we really enjoyed The Secret Lab and other escape room games. This particular one was just not for us.

Of the three Exit titles, we had the hardest time with Pharaoh's Tomb, earning a measly 3 stars by the end of it.  There was some seriously obtuse stuff in this one (at least to us) even after we should have been more versed in the puzzle-logic of the authors, having played one of the previous titles beforehand.

Though popular thinking has the Secret Lab as the hardest one, there were just a few places where logic didn't apply in the Tomb, and that seriously hurt my opinion of it.  Rather that being completely illogical, it simply asks that you make a jump from time to time with very little to go on.  I don't like that, especially in the real deal, and this being a tabletop version doesn't make it excusable.

Still, despite our score, we had a good time with this one, though admittedly we felt a bit beaten by it.

RATING: 4
This one was really disappointing, bordering on a waste of time. The puzzles here are super gimmicky. This is the second in the Exit series that we have played, the first being The Secret Lab, which had its share of gimmicks. The Tomb's last puzzle is ridiculous. We're enjoying the Unlock series much more.

I love escape room games. I mean, the real ones. This is the first board game implementation of them I played. And I must say, it really captures the feel of a real escape room game. The only thing I don't like, is the destructivity, but with the need for more time, you can play it non-destructively. But I like The Secret Lab more.

RATING: 8
Unfortunately, I chose this as my first Exit game during a double date night and it was very unclear what we were supposed to be doing. We ended up trying to solve too many of the puzzles with symbols at once and jumped to a lot of conclusions that had us revealing riddle and answer cards way out of order, which then snowballed into more confusion to the point that we put it away and played something else.

I ended up revisiting it solo the next day and took my time with it to try and figure out what we did wrong. Once I realized that you can only solve puzzles that have an actual "chest" associated with it revealed, then things went much more smoothly for me and I was able to solve everything on my own with the help of a few clue cards.

I was genuinely blown away by how some of these puzzles were pieced together and am disappointed I wasn't able to get things running smoothly with my friends. Now that I know more of what to expect I'm hoping we can try it again with one of the other scenarios.

Overall, an excellent experience! It's a shame that I botched my first attempt at it with my friends.

RATING: 6.5
This one is more difficult than the abandoned cabin and at several points, we had to explain to my daughter HOW we got certain answers, which was a little disappointing as the complexity level here was just out of her reach and thus she was less engaged with this one. 
We were also quite frustrated that several of the things you unlock look very similar and thus you end up getting wrong answers because you look up the incorrect reference.
Feels less polished than the 1st one we played but still the puzzles were unique, and a good time was had by all (mostly)

I really like solving puzzles. This one dissapointed me a little bit because some puzzles are not logic to me. (I can't explain why, because I do not want to spoil the experience for other players.) I do not like the fact that the game is useless after play. (I teach ecologics) Pictures are rather small, when playing with 4 it is difficult to find a way to let every player see them.

Couple of issues with this game. First of I'm not a big fan of the one-time use and throw away type of. game. Other escape-room based games can also be played once (due to the spoilers), but can be given to other gaming groups. This one can't.

Puzzles are quite far fetched escecially at the beginning of the game. Without having a clue as to what to do you're thrown into the game.

Cards are quite small and since you'll take on one puzzle at a time, it not hard to play with two players and almost impossible to play with more.

All in all I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. If you're into escape room-based games just try Unlock! and Escape Room: The Game.

A dastardly clever game that had us cursing (pun sort of intended) the designers every step along the way.

I suspect that the other games in the series will be a bit easier to accomplish with one out of the way, knowing now the extent to which the games go...

...it's really hard to write this up without a spoiler. All in all, I would play another game in the series again and would probably still not see the level of craftiness coming.

Don't worry about the score.  If you're looking for the best score, just look at the answers to each puzzle, solve the game in 10 minutes and get your 5 or 6 stars and move on.  No, seriously, don't do that.  When I played it, I got 1 star (the lowest possible score) but still had a fun time doing it.  It's hard to rank a game you can only play once, but it was enjoyable.

The wife and I had a great time playing this.  We hadn't played an escape game before, but after our fumblings with the first puzzle we fell into a groove and couldn't stop playing.  Utilizing our printer/copier we managed to keep the game in "like new" shape to pass on to another gamer.  With brain scratchers, teasers, and some glorious "Ah ha!" moments, the two hours it took to complete this game went by far too quickly.  We're now looking forward to cracking into "The Secret Lab" next week!

After the Abandoned Cabin this is my favorite, really cool puzzles to solve, but one was just impossible to solve (if you played, you know what puzzle I`m talking about) with some luck and with the help of my friend`s lexical knowledge we have found the solution, but I`m sure there`s people out there (myself included) who has no idea from how  should they find the solution from that context. 

After we made the escape we read the help cards to find info about this, but no explanation. Still, this is a solid 9 for me.

I picked up all three of the Exit games at Origins 2017 for $10 each. I'm not a puzzle type person, never been very good at them, but I thought for the price I would give them a shot.

I played this one with 8 people. WAY too many! I think 6 may even be too many. That aside, I didn't have much fun with it. The game is so small that having more than 2 people around a clue gets hard to deal with. 

Outside of that, the others had a good time. The game itself is something else. The way they built the puzzles is really thinking outside of the box and very cool.

This was hard! But also very involved, tricky and puzzely.

The game still managed to amaze us and present a whole new challenge with unique puzzles. Some hints were really hard to find! 
Great fun for 90 min. Best played with 4 because of some small details that everyone should be able to see and try out.

RATING: 6
Difficulty balance felt way off. Two puzzles that were too hard and we spent a long time beating our heads against, one of which having a really stupid, unsatisfying solution, seven that were way too easy and we solved basically instantly, and only one that was actually interesting/clever. Of course this is going to be very dependent on the group and the particular mindset everyone's in when doing it. But that was my experience, it was a few short bursts of really easy puzzles, a couple of really long slogs with nothing to do but stare at a single unsolved puzzle, and a small amount of actually interesting stuff.

I don't know...you escaped but we don't know how we did it. I feel that we flipped the wrong card or jumped to a wrong conclusion along the way that allowed us to escape in error. There were a ton of cards we never explored and mysteries we could see but never touched. Is it that fragile of a game? I bought a few more with the other themes so we'll see how they go before I pass judgement.

Due to the Unlock! series of games, I have become a big fan of escape rooms. Before playing the game I never considered going to one, but now I have played all the Unlock! Games (I love them all) and I went to two real life escape rooms. I love this genre and I was very excited to play any Exit game until I found out you have to destroy the components, due to this, I decided I was never going to buy any of the Exit games. This month, a friend came with the game and we played it, and I can say it was a lot of fun!

However, not all things are good. In general, I have a bittersweet feeling about the game, like T.I.M.E Stories, once you played through it, you won’t play it again because you already know the answer so it has zero replay value. And to make things worse, you have to physically destroy the game while you play it, so any resale value is lost. It isn’t about the money though, I was raised in a third world country and I was always taught that you do not waste if you can avoid it so I loathe legacy style games that destroy or permanently modify the game. To me, it is immoral and unethical to create games that are disposable (even more when the designer can easily make them resettable), even if they create a great experience. 

After playing Exit: The Game – The Pharaoh's Tomb, I can confirm that it is possible to play the game without destroying or modifying anything (you need a little patience and creativity. but it is possible) and we played it this way. The copy of my friend can be enjoyed by another group of players.

Cool theme although a bit illogical (I don’t care much about this).

The game system is very clever, you need to solve some puzzles logically and if you can’t, there are help cards that tell you the answer. Before we began playing the game with my friends, we agreed we wouldn’t use the aid cards no matter what and we didn’t. Due to this, one of my friends got tired and he fell asleep during the game (we were stuck for a while) so we were two players trying to solve it. To me, it is very important to solve the puzzle without any external help, due to this, it took us 5 hour to finish it :D, but we did it. I think these hard games are best played with 4 players. We were stuck many times during the game, but we persisted and we managed to finish it. 

The puzzles found in Exit: The Game – The Pharaoh's Tomb are much harder than most regular Unlock! games. In this regard, they are only compared to Unlock! The Island of Doctor Goorse which has been the hardest Unlock! game to date. This is A BIG positive for me.
 
[o]
There were some puzzles that I was able to solve only because I solved very similar puzzles in the Unlock! games. 

The first puzzle about the mirror is very similar to the Walkie-Talkie puzzle in Unlock! The Island of Doctor Goorse and both puzzles that included the game box had some similarities to the final puzzle in Unlock! Squeek & Sausage. 

I have noticed I have become a lot better at solving puzzles since I began playing these kind of games :D.
[/o]

After playing the game, I see no reason for the game to be truly disposable. The designers could have easily made the game resettable, this is a big issue for me. If I do play any other Exit game I will do my utmost effort to not damage it.

Bottom line, Exit: The Game – The Pharaoh's Tomb is a great escape room game. I LOVE it has a high difficulty rating (which I crave, I dislike easy games). My desire to play all the Exit series of games is very high, but I won’t buy the games due to their disposable nature (an unsurmountable obstacle for me) . I can perhaps play them with the same friend who introduced me to Exit: The Game – The Pharaoh's Tomb. After playing it, I can say I prefer the Unlock! series of games, I really prefer the flexibility an app brings to the table and you don’t have to destroy the game while you play it. I really hope all the Exit games retain this level of difficulty. I would normally rate the game a 7.0 or higher, but I can’t, in good conscience, rate a disposable game that high.

Current Rating: 6.0

I think I liked this one even more than The Abandoned Cabin. Overall, I can now say that I prefer Exit series more than Unlock. Exit series is more about hardcore abstract brain puzzles while Unlock seems to be more about well illustrated thematic family oriented fast-paced puzzles. Solving puzzles in Exit feels more rewarding to me.

Not my type of game. And one of the worst experiences regarding board gaming so far. I just sat there, watching an alpha player do all the talking and deciding. After 50 minutes it was over and I was glad to take the next train home. Don't get me wrong.. the alpha player is one of my best friends and I'm not mad at her. It's just.. the game is barely a game. More a collection of bland exercises.

We played an Unlock! scenario first and found that we enjoyed that setup much more than this Exit: The Game scenario. It was still fun and a challenge (and maybe TOO much of a challenge, which might be our fault for jumping into this one instead of doing The Abandoned Cabin first). In either case, it seems my family as a whole prefers Unlock!, so we'll seek out those games more. This is still pretty good, though.

Hard to rate as I will never play again, but it was a fun experience. Suggest to play with 4 people who share the cost of the game, so everyone has about 1-2 hours of fun for 3 € (at the MSRP of 12 € in Germany). So forgoing the BGG scale and rating it an 8.5, as I will definitely go out and get another Exit game, if they make one!
But beware, if you do not want to play all of those, skip this one!

It was fine. Better than the Secret Lab (because it's easier, more thematic and more cohesive), but worse than the Abandoned Cabin. A bit too easy at times. Also 2p seems best here imho, because some riddles aren't that great for more than two players if you'd ask me. In the end it should be an okay buy for you, but make sure you played the Cabin, too.

I had fun and one of my friend had too, but we were 4 and only 2 had fun the other just did something else after 30 minutes. It is a good 2 players game but not more. I heard in some review that there is a lot of puzzle you can do at the same time but this just not true for this one as most of the time you are gated by another puzzle making it hard to think on different puzzle what would justify to have more players. I also would not start with this one (what we did) as the first "riddle" you have to solve is not really good and we were not sure how we were even suppose to play. It seems obvious that the very first riddle should be not too difficult but apparently not for the authors.

The most difficult escape room board game we've done to date.  It took us 135 min 20 sec and 3 help cards.  It did have a really awesome Eureka moment. 

Best with 2 -- not really enough material for more.  Take the staple out of the book so people can work multiple puzzles simultaneously.

This one is pretty hard. At least for us it was. Perhaps it was doing it in translation in a language only one of us is fluent in, but the game asks for mental leaps and connections we just would not have made in a hundred years. This one is very cleverly put together, I was thrilled at the solutions and the way the game utelizes its components, but I just couldn’t make those leaps.

I had a really good time with this game. I found the difficulty level just right to be challenging but solvable with no hints.

KdJ 2017? Yeah, right. Why not pick Tic-Tac-Toe next time? Low(est) quality components, poor rulebook => no fun at all! Won't play this again (any real escape game is way better than this commercial rip-off).

Speaking of rip-offs: I also strongly detest the concept of ripping your game apart while playing it (makes for a high replayability...).

I know it's just a board game award, but I can't help but feel a little mad at EXIT: The Pharoah's Tomb inclusion on the Kennerspiel nominee list.

I tried it at a friend's house while I was casually waiting for another game to finish.  My friend has a tendency to buy any board game that comes across his path, so he has a house full of games that have flimsy rulesets, poorly edited rulebooks, designs and mechanics very much in need of more playtesting and refinement, cheap components - just overall poor production value.  

EXIT belongs in his house.  The first puzzle was basically like "Turn to page 10, figure out a number, and then do something with the number".  Figuring out the number was easy.  Figuring out what to do with the number once you had it??  According to the forum thread https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1781452/stuck-first-puzzle-all-clues-used I needed to use page 3 and 4 based on a help card?  I don't have the game anymore with me, since it is at my friend's house, but I am 99% certain there was no help card.  The posters who responded were German, and I'm guessing they had a different set of components in the German version than I did in the English version.

I'm not even sure if it's worth trying again.  Glances at future puzzles didn't convince me that these puzzles would actually be fun or any less head-scratching.  I'm wondering if this is a translation issue?  The cards to me look ugly and chaotic.  The print and graphics are too small.  Apparently you have to tear up parts of the cards so you can't even use the components again.  Fabulous.  And that's not even touching on how it's basically not even really a game (others have already commented on that).

So yeah, disappointed that this ... game ... was nominated.


P.S. Captain Sonar is considered a Kennerspiel-level game and not a Spiel-level game?  That's weird.

Played with three players.  Good and puzzle-y though I mistakenly started us on this one thinking it was the easiest when it is (supposedly) the hardest.  That likely resulted in us taking a few more hints that needed to get into the right mindset of the puzzles - but we never needed to resort to a solution and I'm really glad those existed.  Good variety of puzzles too.

This was the first puzzle game like this I've played, and I really enjoyed it. Figuring out the puzzles was fun, and while some information was easy to get, finding out where to use that information was a bit of a challenge. We finished in 67 minutes and used one clue card (on Imhotep's puzzle) – the clue didn't really tell us anything we didn't know, and then I realized the solution. There's some rather clever lateral thinking required.

Standard ratings don't really apply to these puzzles, but The Pharaoh's Tomb does get thumbs up from me.

Together with the 'abandoned cabin', this was thematically the best of the EXIT series I've played.

This was my second Escape the Room-style game, with Stargazer's Manor being my first. I definitely enjoyed this one more, both for being more thematic, and allowing for answers to be conveyed in a more effective method. I still really suck at these though, so I may not be pursuing them for too much longer. I still feel like so many clues and things are vague enough that it frustrates me. For those who like puzzle games, however, I found this game to be quite the experience.

RATING: 5
I think my experience with EXIT was slightly spoiled by not quite understanding what i was getting into.  I was disappointed to find that a few of the puzzles couldn't really be solved without using clues; attempting to think through them logically would have gotten us nowhere.  The components are also really tiny, and it made a few group members grumpy when it felt like materials were being hogged.

Kind of a weird introduction into the EXIT series.  I think I want to try more?

Probably my least favorite of the original three. Had an issue with the final puzzle that detracted from my enjoyment - don't want to go into details to avoid spoilers, but will say I liked the idea of that puzzle better than the implementation.

Also seem to recall that it was harder to keep all components in reusable condition for this game, which triggers my OCD. :)

Still had fun, still recommend giving it a shot.

RATING: 3
A disposable puzzle that gets increasingly inconvenient to use with more than two participants. Uneven puzzle design: many of the puzzles are very straightforward and instantly solved, while some of them are really convoluted. 

This was the first product of this series that we tried, and the experience felt very frustrating. Now that I’ve played four of these, I did a quick rerun just to see whether this really is as bad as it seemed the first time. And it sure feels like the worst of the series so far:

First of all, the ”Where do you see the symbol” cards create constant confusion because A) the objects on them look [i]very[/i] similar, and B) diamond objects can be seen on two of the images.

Second, at least one of the puzzles can be solved before you know what you are trying to open.

Also, in the English edition, the diamond puzzle seriously suffers from translation without localization.

I have played all three, and this one is my favorite! The puzzles are the hardest and, in my opinion, the most logical. Also the most creative for sure! Very clever stuff. 
If I were to rank all three, they would go:
1. The pharaoh's tomb (excellent and quite challenging)
2. The abandoned cabin (excellent, but easier)
3. The secret lab (quite boring, but still worth it, if you like the other two).

Terrible. Senseless puzzles, no clear direction regarding how to use the "booklet," and more arduous than fun. Recycled as soon as completed. Wish I could get those 90 minutes back. The disposable/not-reusable component also makes it useless for giving away for free. Much prefered the Unlock! series. Avoid.

Technisch gesehen habe ich es noch, aber es ist zerspielt.

Of the first three this is the hardest and also the one with the least immersion of the theme. Frankly, the themes incoporation is ridicilous. The puzzles are pretty much hit & miss for me: There were some good puzzles and some great ideas. But there was also a whole lot of frustration in the box. It might be, because this was the first of the three Kosmos-games we played, but really, getting stuck is not always fun. And one puzzle we solved before we knew what was openend, which caused some hickups in the timeline.

I liked the abandoned cabin one more, but this was a solid release. Apparently puzzle games are not our thing as the time listed on this is like 45-60 minutes and we're often pushing 2 hours with numerous hints. The first hind card is often a complete waste though as we're often stuck further than the advice it gives.

I will say occasionally I feel rather smart when I "get" a puzzle. Some are way too easy and others are mind numbingly hard.

What a disappointment...
So yeah it's a fun concept and the setup is well done. Deck of enigmas, deck of solutions that "check" if you're right, hints and solutions deck and the lock wheel, all this is well made, an 8 right there.

But I had trouble with 3 enigmas.... 1 was counter intuitive, a simple one though but setup in a way that did not make sense. Heck the hint had been positioned differently on the card i'd have no comment on it.
The other 2 go directly against the rules... 

** spoiler (-ish)** 
They specifically tell you what you start of with... and that specific items need to be explicitly found.... and then you need to use stuff you didn't start with or haven't found... 
** end spoiler **

ridiculous and a waist of time on these enigmas, we only found out cause my wife cheated and looked at the hints while I was working on the clues we had.
I follow rules to the letter and don't cheat... so yeah big flaw here for me, completely broke my fun... there's a little hint for one of them... but it's far fetched and neither explicit nor immersive to the game.
It happened twice. big -2 here.

The end result is that I have a sour taste in my mouth after playing this game I was hyped for.... hope the unlock series doesn't let me down, cause unless the cabin and lab are top notch (already bought them), I won't be returning here. -1

I have played other escape room games (including The Abandoned Cabin) and enjoyed them.  I am mostly a Eurogame player, so theme generally doesn't matter, but this one, the story fell flat. There were a few jokes, and quite good puzzles, but it wasn't as strong a game as others.

Based on reading of rules, felt I had a solid grasp of what the game would provide.

Without spoiling anything, our team of four - and more would have been a waste, as you couldn't easily share the clues around - thoroughly enjoyed our play of this, with the added challenge of trying to be no-destructible (it *is* possible). The mechanics of the game (shown on the box) are three decks of cards (Riddles, Answers and Clues), a book and a decoder ring. There was a little more rules overhead than I expected, but it was a quick read essentially to tell you how to check if your answers are correct. After a few minutes, we were deep into puzzly goodness and emerged a while later with 7 stars.

This was my first Exit game, after playing several Unlock! games. I prefer the Unlock! series thus far, but this game was pretty enjoyable. 

We played this with 5 and I felt it did a relatively poor job at actually having enough stuff to do at any one time. This scenario felt very linear in that the group had to solve one puzzle before working on the next puzzle and so on. If we had been able to simultaneously work on several puzzles at a time it would have been much better. As is I'm not sure I'd suggest you play this with more than 2-3, since it is hard to get more people than that all working on a puzzle on a small sheet of paper together. 

With that out of the way, the actual puzzles were pretty cool and the system worked well. Whenever we did get a bit stuck there were always plenty of hint cards that worked pretty well to nudge things in the right direction without completely giving it all away in one swoop. 

Finally, this really is a one use game. It would be very hard to play this without component destruction. This is one other reason I slightly prefer the Unlock games since I can lend or gift those away.

From Exit series this was nice to play. I liked riddles.
Accept one riddle. Simply because wordings on cards were unclear what we had to do. We got everything, we understood idea, but jeez, they could use more specific wording on that riddle card, because otherwise we would try many of variations that we understood what could be done there. AND we took first two clue cards on that riddle just to understand what we had to do, but even clue cards had really vain explanation, only from image on clue card we understood what they meant us to do.

Overall, this got really nice theme on game, still rating high, we finished it rather fast. Something is working opposite for my play group - lower leveled Exit games makes us think more than higher tiered ones.
Is it just us? Maybe we are thinking more "out of box" than we actually need to.

At the time this review was published, I have played fourteen escape room scenarios spanning seven different series. Included in that count are my plays of The Abandoned Cabin and The Pharaoh's Tomb in the EXIT: The Game series from KOSMOS. I am happy to report that this series is my favorite so far with Escape Room The Game is a close second. There are many similar games now available and my concern was that they would start feeling the same and repeat puzzles and content. However, the EXIT games definitely put those thoughts to rest for now since they were incredibly engaging, creative, and innovative. They present a fresh approach, different puzzles, and a challenging experience. Overall, there is quite a bit of adventure packed into a small box with minimal components and a really attractive price point. I really look forward to playing The Secret Lab and all of the other upcoming EXIT games. The announcement list of new EXIT games includes another eight and my excitement just keeps growing. The next few months should be another really fun time for escape room games!

Worst gaming experience I've had.  I had to ask myself if I would rather play the two games that I have rated a 2, more than this game.  Those games are Risk and Monopoly, and the answer is yes.  Frustrating.  At times, too small for more than one person to look at.  Sometimes unlogical and annoying.  Most importantly though, just not fun.  Hate the idea of "one time play" games.  When the game sucks on top of that, you get a "1".

The is the third of a series of 3 Exit games I've played.  The first one I played was The Secret Lab so check out my comments on that game for a full review.

This one was the most difficult one for us.  I don't think it was particularly more difficult than the other two, I just think it dealt with thinking skills a little more outside our groups standard process.  It could have also been that we were getting burned out with this being the third one we played that day.  If you are trying to decide on just one to get, my vote would be for The Abandoned Cabin.

I would say some people will really love this type of game/ activity but for me it was very tedious and frustrating: riddle solving is clearly not my thing. I have never done a real escape room but my husband has and he thinks this experience pales in comparison. Sure, one shouldn't expect the same but he was really let down by this.
Additionally, it annoyed me when the rules clearly state you can solve the riddles in any order and move to another one if you struggle with one, we hit a point where it was clear that was not the case because we needed a clue (which was a card with a picture) from a different riddle to be able to move on after we solved ours. So rules, don't tell me any order is fine when it is clearly not.
Not for me, really not for me but I do get what others might enjoy here. Plus, this experience can vary a lot depending on the group you are playing with, and I think more experience with these types of games will get your brain working in the right way and you will go quicker through the puzzles. We played for 1.45hr and were mildly annoyed when we didn't see a way to continue (though I was just glad this was finally over at that point), we only solved a fraction of the puzzles. It seems if you want to do this in an hour you cannot take more than 5 minutes per puzzle.

Only playable with TWO people max...maybe even better solo as there just isn't a lot to look at while playing and six minds are not always better then one. Not for children as the downtime as you sit quietly and think is unbearable.

Wow! What a great game! I got the worst-possible score (153 minutes, and 16 hint cards), but it was a blast! I can't wait to try the others.

First EXIT game play after several UNLOCKS...  Significant increase in difficulty due to the abstract nature of the puzzles and use of "everything" in the box.   After muscling through the riddles and leveraging quite a few clue cards, I have to acknowledge the pure genius and creativity of the designers.  However, I am not sure I can get the wife to play this series again Based on her comment "I am glad we can throw this game away!".  Note to self - No adult beverages when playing the EXIT Series.

This was our first exit game, and it was a struggle.  We ended up having fun, but not knowing the extent to which this game went outside the box made for some frustration.

Nice, not that hard, solo in 56 minutes, needed help for the last puzzle (tipp 1+2)
I didn't destroy anything and game is playable again by someone else - just used some transparent lamination foil, whiteboard markers and some brainpower to visualize the things you would damage otherwise...

Excellent escape room style boardgame; taking into account only the puzzles, it is leaps and bounds better than its competition. In this one in particular the coolness of the puzzle is off the scale; it blows out of the water even the other games in the Exit series.

The most difficult of the first three. Easier if you are willing to destroy some of the components.

Played solitaire. Playing time was 75 minutes with a couple of hints used.

This game is very, very clever. I was constantly impressed by the quality of the puzzles. That said, I think some of the clues were unfair in that you have to essentially read the mind of the person who designed them to have even a chance to solve them. In one case, my group solved the puzzle correctly, but the tiny image on the solution card was misleading and we thought we got it wrong. Overall, I'm glad I tried it, and I would GM it for other people, but I'm unlikely to buy any more in the series.

This series of one-shot escape games provide a similar kind of puzzle solving as seen with real escape rooms and are very creative in their puzzles.  There's not enough here to justify the full player count though; 2 or maybe 3 players is enough. I would recommend that they are played in the following order: Abandoned Cabin, Secret Lab, and then Pharaoh's Tomb.

I would not recommend playing this in a noisy dark bar like my group did.  A quiet well-lit home would have been much better (like I recommended, but who listens?).

Five of us chipped in $3 apiece at a local con to give it a shot.  One was too tired to participate for more than 18 minutes, another muttered after realizing what he'd been suckered into, and the other three (myself included) enjoyed the two-hour brain twizzle.

Pharaoh's Tomb was a wedding night experience for me, as I've never been near a "real" escape room and it was my very first Exit game. It never felt unfair or trivial to our puny human brains, and I look forward to trying the other two Exits (Cabin, Lab) with family or friends.  And $10.50 per game from online vendors is a pretty reasonable price.

The hardest of the escape room games we've played yet. Small group important unless you have a projector or can take a few minutes to photograph things for everyone to use, as the components are small and not easily shared.

We found this instalment in the Exit series to be much harder than the other two we had tried (Secret Lab and Abandoned Cabin). It took us twice as long to complete it and we needed a couple of hints. There are some very devious puzzles involved and more lateral thinking required, however we found them all fair and it was an enjoyable experience (if a little longer than we'd bargained for).

Ötletes, 90%-os szabadulószobás élmény, így eléggé bejött a játék. Az Unlock mondjuk kicsit komolyabb volt, vagy legalábbis ár/érték arányban vonzóbb lehet, főleg most, h az is jön magyarul. Mindenesetre beszerzem a többit is, érdemes őket végigjátszani.

If you're familiar with Escape-room like games, and have some experience with these kind of puzzles, you may enjoy this one. But for us it was our introduction to this genre, and it caused more frustration than joy. Like many other people remarked, we were not even sure what we should be doing, or what exactly we were allowed and what not. It's like playing a game for which you are unsure what the rules are. The authors should have graded their Exit games according to difficulty (like they do for sudoku's) and let beginners start with the easier ones.

This is the second series I try from escape room genre and while I recognise that these games are incredibly ingenious and novel... they just aren't for me. Not IRL, not in tabletop format. Apart from the frustratingly cryptic puzzles, my main gripe is the potentially horrible amount of downtime whenever you get stuck. At that point player engagement drops completely making the game drag.

I appreciate the Exit series taking a completely analogue approach, but if anything the Unlock series just might be a bit more accessible and polished.

Verdict: [b]5.5[/b]

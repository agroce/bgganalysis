This underrated gem deserves far more attention than it gets, perhaps mostly just because of the perception that it's an "old" game (even with the fairly recent 2.0 edition).  And the graphics do look a bit dated, but what makes this game perfect for us are all the things that got me interested in the first place:  Fog-of-war, a variety of units with different strengths & weakness, straightforward rules and a game system that allows one to develop and employ some strategy.  Build-your-own battles can go a bit long, esp. if everyone allows the battle to degenerate into a simple war of attrition, and it's a shame that scenarios aren't published more regularly.  Don't be scared by the random boosters; it's not a collectible game in the usual sense and you can simply buy as few or as many of them as you'd like -- there's no real urge to have a "complete" set....

My kids are 11, 9, and 4, and they all like it alot, esp. the older one.  The 4-yo is way under the rated age, however, he's learned a few of the rules and his brothers tolerate him having a few units of his own on the map.  I've seen them play for as much as 2 hours straight, which is far longer than any other game they've ever played.

RATING: 6
This is like a medieval version of [thing=87][/thing], except using the simpler [thing=3685][/thing] combat system.  Great pieces and enough chrome (in this case, special rules for wizards casting spells) to differentiate the theme from the other block games.  The units have a lot of variability due to building costs, special terrain benefits and total combat value and "to hit" values, and varying geomorphic maps ensure that no two games will play the same.  An improved initiative procedure would bump this one up to a 9, as it is the game's only real weakness (just like Victory).  Overall, another excellent offering in the Columbia lineup.

Excellent lite wargame. The fog of war brought about by the blocks make this one interesting as with most of the Columbia block games. The differences in the armies make for some good strategic choices while the terrain variety, unit differences and fog of war make for some excellent tactical situations. The armies on the whole seem to be very nicely balanced although they have very different strengths and weaknesses. About an hour a person or so in length and only 8 pages of rules. 

To avoid the much talked about defensive stagnation and turtling stick to two maps per 100 points of units per player. The game really shines when you allow the units to fully exploit their strengths. Since much of this involves terrain differences and movement capabilities the game plays best with plenty of space to maneuver. I have the 1st edition of the game with most of the expansion armies and maps. I play using the v1.6 rules.

25 Jan 07:  Version 1 is a marvelous game!  It requires both strategic and tactical considerations, combining some of the ideas which make games like Titan and Hammer of the Scots and ASL so fabulous.  The only drawbacks are a lack of scenarios (which your own imagination can solve) and some squabbling over the ruleset to use.

If you like wargames and fantasy themed games then this game is for you. It has all the strategy and fog of war like Columbia's other block games. Rules are not too bad especially if you have already played a block game.  Mega props to Chris Farrell for making some great scenerios.  Can take a long time to play. Sold.

More of a game system than a game. The 2nd edition is better. I like the fog of war from the blocks, but it bugs me (slightly) that my Orcs are standing on their head when they are at full health.

Wizard Kings is a complete game and not "just a kit" as many other players stated. Use a little imagination to create your own scenarios and additional rules. This game leaves much room for that, which I appreciate.

I only wish there was a guideline to create attacker-defender scenarios. This is a strong army attacks a weak one, however the latter has a stronger economy. So at a time there will be a turning point. Think of the second world war on the eastern front.

(Version 1) A very good implementation of the Columbia block system which is let down by a a lack of scenarios.  (In the ones provided the attacker is always at a massive disadvantage; resulting in a game similar to real-life WW1.)

I think played this once.  Regardless I bought it (and so many extras) due to my love for other games by the same company.  I don't know if it was good for its time, but now it's more like a toy than a game.  It's not simple enough or short enough to stand out.  It's not complex enough to engage me.  And there's no campaign or driving story.

There are many things I like about this game, but it comes to down simple rules (for a war game, but even compared to most CCG's out there) and variety (terrain, maps, armies, and the Chaos units are fun).  If you want a turn-based Warcraft, I think this is the best thing.  I never liked keeping track of all my peasants anyways, but the game is still one of resources (lose cities, lose gold).  There are more scenarios these days, but there need to be more; I'm working on a couple.
  
Use the 1.5 rules.  The 1.6-style rules I wouldn't use until they were playtested and edited a lot more.
  
I keep this game around because it's one of the most varied of the block wargames, army and unit-wise.  Plus I love the fantasy theme, and the special powers of the Wizards and Chaos units adds a lot!  And the maps are great---a lot of terrain to maneuover and develop tactics and strategy around.  Good asymmetrical scenarios are pretty much a must.

A block game with a modular map setup, giving lots of potential for variety in the way the boards are laid out. Standard block design with "step" strength shown by how the blocks are orientated. 8 armies and 4 maps in the base game is quite good, but there is a lot of water in the 4 maps here, which can cause problems (in that you have a lot of work to do to move places!).

RATING: 8
I feel this game has some elements of Warcraft the boardgame. The combat system is somewhat similar , manoeuvering your troops and finding a way to strike at your enemy is one of the important parts of the game.

I like that you get to build your own army and that after the turn ends you can buy new units. I also like the different units they really make you able to exploit different tactics.

We always play a 10 turn game to get a 2,5 hour game.

Columbia block game set in a fantasy world. Plays very similarly to their "Victory" series. There are a number of different races that can be chosen with "Chaos" units to add even more variety. Armies are built on a point system and scenarios played out on geomorphic hex grid maps.

The rules have undergone a full revision (V 2.0) as well as the races and marketing model. Instead of the base game having all the units for two races with other races available to purchase separately, now there is a degree of randomness in each box with some accessories available separately. I'm not at all sure about the new marketing model.

Game play is fast and tense, with the "fog of war" aspect that Columbia games are famous for. Movement and combat are not as intuitive as many hex based war games so experience counts for a lot and it takes some getting used to. I like the game a lot but don't get to play much (basically two player war game but multi-player scenarios are possible).

Cute enough. I think the block mechanism works better
with this type of strategic scale. Maybe only because I'm
more used to AT-like games at it though. Not the least thrilled
with the collectible nature of the pieces though, nor
with not having the armies special rules for non-orc/elves.
If the game didn't have stupid wooden blocks, it could
probably provide the whole set in one box at the same price.

RATING: 7
Rating reflects 1st edition - the only good edition in my opinion.

Wizard Kings 2.0 is a 5 for me.  The factions all feel the same and I strongly dislike the new production rules and combat rules.  My favorite ruleset for this game is 1.5 with modified stacking (similar to 1.6).

Also, what's the deal with all the water on the included maps in 2nd edition?  That was a Really Bad Decision.  This game needs Land to predominate, particularly since some factions have no flyers (other than Wizards) or aquatic units.

Provisional rating after one play.  I believe it will rise.

This is the fantasy combat game to end all fantasy combat games.  I have had it for 3 years, and just now (June, 2005) got around to playing it.  Deep and wonderful, it may not be as good out of the box as Columbia's other game - Hammer of the Scots - but Wizard Kings can be anything I want it to be.  Dice, yes, but lots of decisions, too.  I played with a certain Euro-gaming friend of mine, and he offered it the highest of compliments without realizing it.  When I resigned after three hours of play (my undead versus his elves with rules 1.6) he said, "I can't believe that three hours have gone by."

So far, I've only played this with three people (my two college-game-former-D&D-pals). We enjoyed it very much... but I'm convinced this can't really be played 3-player. At least not well. I'm holding my judgement until I can get a few solid 2-player games in.

UPDATE FOR VERSION 2: It took me a while to come around on V2, but I finally did. Like v1, it's a gamekit as much as a game - the scenarios supplied are inadequate and don't show off the system - but the system is very good, and while people who were big fans of v1 will require an adjustment to v2, I think it's ultimately worthwhile to do so. So, WK keeps its 10 rating in either version. I don't necessarily think V2 is superior to V1 or vice versa, they are just different animals. I like them both, although WK1 definitely had the better out-of-the-box experience - the whole booster thing means you need to buy a few (3-5) boosters to really get mileage out of the game.

The caveat: Wizard Kings 2 is much harder to balance for scenario designers. When I designed WK1 scenarios, it was pretty easy to look at the production balance and figure out a good general balance point for assymetrical scenarios. V2 is much harder. With production a pain to consolidate, the balance between on-board and pre-game production and the value of Wizards is much harder to gauge. For most scenarios, I think some kind of production consolidation/simplification rules will be very helpful, for a lot of reasons, both playability and for getting reasonable balance.

A note on collectability: Unfortunately, early adopters got kind of screwed as the initial lot of labels was a subset (and not a large one) of the total available. Fortunately for you, if you're reading this and care about it, you were not an early adopter and these issues have been largely resolved. BUT ... there is one substantial problem with the distribution currently, and that's with the Wizards and Treasures.  In order to be interesting, the game really need each faction to have a couple B  Wizards and at least a Silver. These, sadly, were not supplied in the base game, which is a real shame. With the new production rules, Wizards are hard to use without a Gold or Silver unit to recharge them, and A  Wizards are expensive. Practical solution: make sure to scan your labels (at least 300dpi) as you get them. It's pretty easy to make decent proxies, and you'll want Wizards, Heroes, treasures, and artifacts available for all your factions. Be a little careful of a few undercosted units: Elephants, Assassins, and the C3 (cost 1) Sceptre can be very powerful in low-unit-count (<15) scenarios. With more units, things seem to be in better line.

CAVEAT: There is some substantial eratta for this game. The rather unfortunate part is that Columbia has not seen fit to actually issue it. So, here is what we play with:
- Foes Begone is just like Crypt Smell
- Destruction can eliminate castles
- Sacrifice can eliminate units in general
- Terrain is defined by the type that "dominates" the hex rather than what's in the middle. For mountains and water, interpret very strictly: if it's not totally obvious it's a mountain or lake hex, it's not, and go with the terrain that "dominates" the rest of the hex. It's not great, and the maps have several ambiguous hexes, but once you decide how you're going to play it, it's not that big deal, and in general one of the great strengths of this game is how well the maps are designed for playability.
---
As I've been playing this game more recently, it's been going up and up in my esteem. Great game, possibly one of the best in my collection. Truly, a perfect wargame for eurogamers. Lots of unit choices, with the choices being very interesting. Tactically and strategically rich. Only flaw is that it's a game kit as much as a game, and while there are lots of scenarios, many are a mixed bag. Up there with EastFront and Rommel in the Desert as the best of Columbia, and very straightforward and accessible game as well.

I like the mechanics behind this game and the fact it plays a good number of players. Only played it with 2 so far and once one player got the upper hand it seemed to stick that way for the rest of the game.

If I'm in the mood to get my ass kicked, then I'd play this game again:). No, seriously, it's an interesting strategy game that forces you to think about what you might have done differently. The problem is once you get surpassed in power by other players who take your cities, it's tough to come back due to losing your sources of income.

After several plays, WK brings me close to Heroes of Might and Magic.    There's lots of good stuff in here if you enjoy fantasy battles - "hundreds" of cool units, a bunch of geomorphic maps, distinct spells, and the nice art.  And its a block game.
The collectible thing hasn't bothered me so far.  I've gotten a lot of duplicates even though I haven't bought too many boosters.  My armies have been developing nicely despite the same stuff coming up.  
My favorite part about WK though might be one of its weaknesses for most.  The game encourages you to make up your own scenarios and stories.  I really don't have the time, but I still try to make time; and when I make something that works just a little, then I feel satisfied and happy.

A very good strategic-level wargame, though realism is not its selling point.  The system is very solid as a game and provides plenty of choices during each turn.  The best part, however, is the ease which with imagination can be applied to the game.  It's easy to fall into the Lord of the Rings/D&D-esque world and let your mind run wild with events on the gameboard.

The only thing keeping Wizard Kings from a 10 is the lack of good scenarios under the new ruleset (2.0).  When meshed with a well-designed scenario and played by skilled opponents, this game easily reaches a 10 on my scale.

RATING: 7
Rating based on my desire to play, not on components or underlying game system.

Fun:8
components: 5
system: 6.8

Wizard King is a fun game, but it's sort of an artisanal effort in terms of components. Because Columbia Games apparently only distributes the game directly, they can keep prices relatively high. I payed $46.53, shipped from TimeWellSpent (it wasn't available locally).

Battlelore, which is admittedly a different kind of game, is $58 shipped, but it includes 210 miniatures, mounted boards, tiles, a huge, active fan base, and most importantly, a company that aggressively promotes and supports the game in a timely manner. [update: ha ha!  I got that wrong!]

The last blog entry on the Wizard Kings site was March 20th, approximately six months ago. The most recent posts in the http://blockgames.us forums (which isn't even linked to from the Wizard Kings site) are a month or two old. The third-party email lists are somewhat active.

When you factor in an additional $15 expansion that is arguably needed to play the base game (I'm thinking of treasure blocks, specifically), then one begins to get the nagging feeling that maybe we're not dealing with cottage cheese, but instead really old milk.  It is a fun game, and a cool game system. I like playing it, and I like thinking about playing it, imagining scenarios, etc. But for good or for bad, the boardgame industry has changed and Columbia, at least in terms of support for the game and components, hasn't quite kept up. Perhaps it is because other products (Hammer of the Scots and EastFront?) are bringing in more money. 

What's unfortunate is that there is a really supportive fan base, yet their efforts are scattered over five different sites and a handful of personal pages. It looks like BGG and the internal Wiki are the best single place to visit for information about the game.

I apologize if this sounds excessively negative. I'm a new player, and many of you have suffered through much more for much longer. It is just that the game has so much potential yet seems under-supported and consequently under-ranked.That said, I will probably still order the Heroes/Treasure expansion!

(update: I bought an entire set of the first edition with maps and armies and the heroes and treasure expansion)

Note: the generic scenario would be more fun with bigger, 100gp armies.  Otherwise you spend five turns ramping up.  And I'm totally flying my pixies over the zombies and stealing the rearward cities next time.  Sssshhhh...

This is a great game system that is begging for home built scenrios and even campaign play. Played one and noticed the turtling problem that jsut asks for a rules tweak to fix it.

RATING: 7
I like the fog of war, random map and the variety of units, which make each game unique and exciting. I do not like the price that can be very high if you purchase base set plus decent amount of expansions. (You need additional maps and armies to make the game truly shine) Also, rules are IMHO not streamlined and have a few design flaws. However, the rules can be adjusted and once you have bought the game you no longer need to worry about its price. :)

The rating is based on the base set. It is low primarily due to the lack of variability in the base set. With all the expansion maps and armies I would rate the game 8.

Proof that beautiful components and simple rules do not make a great game.  This game bogs down fast and never recovers, quickly degenerating into a Tolkienesque version of WWI.

Still searching for a great fantasy war game.

This game(?) just doesn´t work! It announces up to 7 players but (hardly) is playable by two.
It seems this is just a working project of a game that has never been tested or even just fit to be able to work!
One of the two victory conditions is virtually impossible to achieve. There are terrible flaws with pratical aspects of the game that make it unplayable. There are absurd rules, even at theorical level: For instance, you might be stuck forever in a city island or there is no motive to conquest new cities, as those you leave behing stop giving you income because you just have no armies available to occupy them!
The constituiton of the armies is nice, as are the combat rules, everything else is just crap, including the game`s components.

RATING: 5
Decent and relatively simple block game with a fantasy theme, with geomorphic maps to boot. If you're familiar with Hammer of the Scots, you're most of the way there in terms of rules, though it has some nice customizations, such as terrain bonuses for certain units. The magic system is simple and effective. The rules could use some improvement in clarity.

Beyond the clarity issues I must say, however, that I largely dislike the 2nd edition rules in general. The GP system is now just too damned fiddly. I prefer the simplicity of a GP pool rather than the per-city gold. They also wimped down the wizards far too much. Yeah, maybe they were a bit overpowered. But you know what? It's called [i]Wizard Kings[/i], that's how it ought to be! I want powerful wizards, not some shitty vanilla block game with artificial rules tacked on. They also switched the combat system to be in line with their other games, which I don't think was necessarily a good thing. The mandatory first round of combat can hose your 'A' units, which I don't like. About the only thing I liked better in 2nd edition was the terrain limits.

I'm also not pleased with the way they're distributing the blocks now. With only 8 blocks per faction, it's not even possible to play most of the scenarios without buying the faction packs. And those are random! Dumb.

RATING: 3
I've never been so disappointed in a game as I was with Wizard Kings.  How horrible is the game that comes with the base set?  I understand that it can be improved by buying expansion armies, downloading scenarios.  But why bother? Might as well buy something good.  The scenario devolves into each player massing up blocks in good defensive positions and staring at one another.  Wow, that's fun.  There's no reason to attack.  Finally we did an all-out attack to see what happened.  It took forever to resolve (please someone roll 1's so this will end).  And guess what, the attacker lost...blah.  The first rule of designing wargames should be to discourage turtling.
This is the only block game I've played, but I don't see myself ever buying another one.  The long-winded combat resolution and "fog-of-war" elements (which way did I rotate that block? how much do I have left to spend? wait, did I already move that guy?)...suck the fun right out of it.

One of Columbia&#039;s &quot;block&quot; wargames, set in a fantasy world. The wooden units stand upright, facing away from your opponent, so they cannot see what forces are opposed against them. Unit strength is governed by which side of the block is currently &quot;on top&quot;. This system comprises of a simple ruleset, lots of different maps, and eight different armies. Lots of replayability in a fun and elegant package.  One of the better block wargames out there.

[Dagliesh] A gem, but a flawed one. Great ideas and perfect theme, but I'd recommend a few house rules to improve WK. Needs some kind of new initiative system, like in HotS.

definitly a tool box for creating your own scenarios rather than a straight up game. Consequently it takes a bit of paper work (tallying up armies etc) before play. The difficulty here for me is that many of my opponents are rather competitive and so prefer rules and setups that aren't decided by me but a game designer.

It's much simpler than Richard III and in my limited experience with it doesn't create quite as many tactically rich situations.

Played once, using a small starter scenario. A good play that didn't take as long as I thought it would; it was quite short, about 40 minutes for our first play.

This is one of the best gateway wargames around. Very simple ruleset yet the game can give such an immense variety of tactical situations to explore. Playing time can be as short or as long as you want it - just pick your scenario. And the expansions really livens up the game and gives so much more options to discover. Of course, enjoyment of the game is dependent on the scenario you play, but part of the fun of WK is to encourage you to come up with your own scenarios.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not as good as Hammer of the Scots, but should be rated higher than it is currently.  I think the main things holding it back are poor introductory scenarios (see the Geek for better ones) and the fact that you really need some of the expansion armies (especially the Dwarves, Amazons and Undead) and maps to really flesh it out.

Titan combat meets blocks.  The limited information becomes mitigated as the game wears on because movement is constrained by excellent entry rules from hexsides.  Lots of choices on your turn although the slugfest can bug down.  I think most games hinge around a turn of the tide, bad/good luck victory which changes the battlefield radically.  Otherwise there can be some static element in the early stages.  Still, will defniitely explore beyond my first try.  There is definitely some meat here.

Fantasy wargame using the Columbia block system. Players control creatures from nine factions/races in various scenarios (available from the Columbia site and various fan sites). Flexible system allows for creativity, and the game can succeed as both a serious 2-on-2 wargame or as a 7-player chaotic romp with the correct setup. The magic system is particularly interesting, with spells draining the health of the magic-wielding unit, making spellcasting units powerful but vulnerable. Combined arms factor is very good. Recommended for fans of fantasy war.

Wizard Kings is fun. Even if you are not into fantasy this game still works. The units can easily be translated into units any wargamer can relate too; infantry, armor, naval, air, etc. Even the Wizard's spells can be viewed like an artillery barrage or morale modifiers.

Update1/19/15:  I finally played 2ed rules.   Only the terrain modifiers from the 2nd Ed do I think I'll use.  The rest didn't improve the game for me.   Being forced to fight one round of combat takes away the screening function of A-blocks.  The 3 round limit + 4th round pursuit rolls I didn't like. To avoid pursuit you essentially are down to 2 round fights.  I liked the simpler common "treasury" and fix any block on the map system better. For me the game is meant to be a lighter fair. The fiddlyness of integrating city treasure and making and transporting treasure blocks to the front is not worth the effort.

Why can't Wizards kill off blocks?!?  Does my lightening strike or fireball lose potency because the target is near death?  Of course it's "magic" but still...

I was looking forward to playing this game and I wanted to like it.  It's pretty simplistic and boring, although I am sure it improves if you invest in expansions, but that involves investing in expansions.  The game seems pretty limited in terms of your choices, and really, it doesn't matter since the dice pretty much seal your fate.  It sounds like the other block games out there are far more interesting.UPDATE: Yes, Crusader Rex and Hammer of the Scots are definitely more interesting to me.  I like those.

A game kit that is greater than the sum of its parts, but only just. Superior to progenitor design Victory thanks to an improved production system, generally greater chances to maneuver, and the all-important Wizard units who prove decisive in battle (even if they are eggshells armed with hammers). The game is attractively presented, and the rules are lean and clear enough. The movement and terrain interactions are clever, and of course the core Columbia engine, with its fog of war and units attacking in order based on their class, remains a joy to play. But as has been frequently noted, the game is only so good as its scenarios, and the scenarios in the box are a mixed bag (while the scenarios provided by enthusiasts via Columbia's website are a crapshoot). The basic "build-your-army-and-bash-the-other-guy" scenario is attritional and once you hit the tipping point of stealing one or two cities from the other guy, it is difficult for the losing player to recover. The pieces are here for promising, custom-crafted scenarios, but I'm not sure I want to be a scenario designer, and the terribly unwise blind-collectable nature of the second edition's expansion packs makes scenario design even more difficult, as there is no reliable way to determine what units everyone will have at hand. I find myself wanting to play the game again but I sense heartbreak in the long run (as was also the case with Victory). I shouldn't have to work this hard to tune-up the game before I can enjoy a balanced contest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.7
Actually this was my first real "Block" game, and I enjoyed it. The rules of the second edition are concise and easy to grasp (even it there are a lot of them). There are some balance issues on one hand with the races and on the other hand with the maps. The four pieces of maps delivered in the game contain many water hexes that only are to cross with ships. However only few of the races own ships! We once had the situation that a player playing with a random race and random map could not leave his island! So we had to introduce some house roules to fix the "water travelling" bother. Some races seem too weak or defensive while others like the Feudal Knights are too strong in offensive. Also a few magic spells felt to be too powerful. Due to these balance issues this game misses an rating of 8 or higher (Rating after two plays with four players). The maps are thin and probably need to be put under a piece of plexiglass for serious play (that's what we did).

Since I'm normally not one for war games and I suck at rolling dice, you'd think I would hate this game.  I'm a sucker for the theme, however, and find the terrain and unit variety appealing.  The combinations make for very different games each play.  The blocks are the niceset "fog of war" mechanism I've seen.  After a dozen or so plays, my strategy skills are improving.  Heck, I've actually won once or twice.  (Of course, my spouse plays one of the weaker armies and I take a stronger one, but still.)  Good enough that we invested in more armies and will probably purchase still yet more armies and maps in the future.

I have both 1.0 and 2.0 edition of Wizard Kings. The game is still one of my favorite games. The new editions to 2.0 accents all the things that I love about the game.  

Terrain makes a bigger impact on the game by effecting hexside and stacking limits. 

The added victory conditions, adjustments on how, where, and when the armies are built, changes to wizards, addition of clerics and other new characters, and custom hero units give an already amazing game more depth.

Too generic. Doesn't seem like fantasy battles at all. Could just as easily be set in World War II with the Wizards being Artillery support or Tactical Air Support. It's a shame that Columbia doesn't support this game. Without new scenarios, there's too much work homebrewing your own. Look elsewhere.

I'm not really into generic fantasy as a genre, but this is above average for a Columbia block game as the variety of unit types means that surprise and bluff are very much a part of the action, while the inclusion of magic means that battles are not limited solely to attrition. The four basic maps are rather limiting so a set of Expansion Maps is pretty much essential to replayability.

Wow.  -So much untold potential here.  I love 'toolbox' games and Wizard Kings appears to be the zenith of such in the block game world.  It actually reminds me of Heroscape in a lot of ways except with fog of war and empire building.  From most of the comments I've read, however, it looks like an exceptional scenario is needed to make the game shine.  Regardless, I want to give this a 10 but I need to give a few more games a try before I psyche myself up too much.  Mmmm, Tasty.

RATING: 7
Good replayability and can be played with more than 2 players.  Can be played quickly (about 1-1.5 hours), we usually play for a set number of turns; typically 10-12 is enough for a victor to be clearly apparent, and it keeps the games down to about 1hr).

Update:  The new rules (v 1.6) add a small number of important changes that are mostly an improvement in my opinion.  My experience under the new rules has been more dynamic and exciting game play.  Others on this forum seem to disagree.

2nd Update:  Received the new version.  The new blocks and rules look good.  First play was fun.  Will adjust rating if necessary after additional plays.

RATING: 10
Excellent game. I love the war aspect of it but I'm usually turned off by war games because of the theme. For some reason, the fantasy theme to the game made it very appealing to me and so I was wiling to try it out. Definatly one of the first war games I've played and enjoyed.

The customization of the armies was pretty fun and building them up to capture cities is great. Looking forward to playing many more games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Considering how simple the rules are, it is surprising that Wizard Kings enables such a high degree of tactical play. Even with the more basic scenarios, games can be dynamic thanks to the flexiblity of flying units. If I owned most of the expansion armies and maps that are available, I am sure that I would play this game many times more. But I don't - I just have a copy of the core 1st edition game and I can't justify to myself paying for the 2nd edition plus expansions. I do have several small criticisms: the basic boxed set is rather limiting, the rules could be more specific on some points and the maps are unclear in places, no scenarios for the game have been developed by Columbia itself, and the expansion maps could be more varied. So, I would heartily recommend Wizard Kings with the caveat that you must be prepared to invest some time (and rather a lot of money) in the game.

Disclaimer: This rating is based on using only the two armies and four maps in the basic game (earlier non-collectible edition).  I see the potential for a much better game if more armies and maps are purchased.  The game just seems incomplete out of the box.  As many others have stated before this seems more like a kit with which to build your own scenario/game.  Unfortunately, this is something that I do not have the time or patience to do.  

This is the weakest of the Columbia block games I've tried by a large margin.

I really enjoy WK.  You have to be willing to fiddle with the rules, but I love the fantasy theme and tactical wargames in general.

I have the 1st Edition plus some expansions. My problem with WK is that as a two player game, once one side gets a bit of an advantage, it's very difficult for the other side to regain the initiative. But it also takes a long time to really be defeated, too. This equals a few minutes excitement, followed by 1 hour + of boredom.

RATING: 8
UPDATE: These comments are only for the 1st edition system (up to v1.5 of the rules).

**One of my favorite of the block games (because it's a system) so far. And a very nice fantasy battle games**

[b]Caveat:[/b] You'll need to track down scenarios to see the game blossom.

My edition came with 1.0 rules and the variance between 1.0 and 1.5 are nominal and really fall into the range of clarifications (v1.0 to v1.5 are the same rules set).

There is hubabaloo over 1.6 and some of the noise is justified, but some if it isn't. But does that noise matter to you if you're starting out with v1.6? Not really, but it's worth reading about in the forums if you care to.

"Wizard Kings" is kind of two games in one: it comes with a "base" game of whoop up on each other and claim a goal level of victory points (city production values), but in my mind it is truly a scenario driven system--scenarios are practically required for 2 players; what I mean by that is: 'Wizard Kings' is a somewhat generic system that comes fantastically to life with specific scenarios (the base scenario given with the game is not enough). With a well done scenario it becomes a fantasy war game system of note.

The troops (when balanced per the articles on the Columbia site) are great. The armies are different, the wars have variety, and you can even put together your own maps if inclined.

I recommend this game heartily, but you will need more maps and some more armies to flesh it out; to save you some investment money please jump over to the "Wizard Kings" forum here on the geek and look for some great starting out articles by BilboAtBagEnd as she has some very good thoughts on deciding where to start. 

Many love it, many who've loved it revile the 1.6 rule set...take it with salt. 'Wizard kings' gives you possibilities...and that is what I love.

This has been a tough rating for me to settle on because the scenarios make a huge impact on your experience with the game (Chris Farrell has some good ones on his site and Columbia Games provides more on their "Wizard Kings" page as well). That said, it's a great system. Not to heavy, fairly easy to learn, it's got a lot of variety, and with a good scenario you're golden.

I had been heavily torn betwixt "Wizard Kings" and "Warcraft: The Board Game" and couldn't decide which way to go so I consulted a very good 'Geek buddy (BilboAtBagEnd) and she pointed me at "Wizard Kings".

Not too long after BilboAtBagEnd shot me her thoughts, it ends up that I got a fantastic opportunity to pick up the entire Wizard King system at a great opportunity sale (a local shop blowing out old inventory). I feel great about the purchase and will be holding on to it.

And, if it matters to anyone at all: I still prefer v1.5 of the rules.

1st ed w/preferred 1.5 rules.  Our second 'block' game from Columbia Games.  I like the expandable nature of this game with available armies and maps for added variety.  I also like the idea of predetermining the number of turns in the game to adjust to various time constrants.  It's this diversity IMO that places this game slightly over our other 'block' game, HotS.

Plays more like World War I than a fantasy wargame.  The combat system gives too much power to the defender, forcing the players to look to the flanks to break the stalemate - not the feel you'd expect for the setting.  I notice the 1.6 rules have added a lower stacking limit and changed the retreat rules, something we used as a house rule in the past - it did make an improvement in the trench warfare conditions for us.  Rating might go up if I were to revisit it today.

UPDATE: Well, I see that Columbia has FINALLY put some scenarios up for WK.  My rating may very well go up.  I'll have to try some.  MY OLD COMMENTS: It is one of the best game construction kits out there.  Too bad it's incomplete or Columbia would have sold twice as many.  It's a game that I would love to play more of, but the lack of scenarios is a killer.  Even the basic, generic battle that is suggested in the rules is poorly designed, in my opinion.  It's too crowded.  I use a bigger board.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
These are comments after a solo play tests.

I find the map design very interesting. It's fun that you could have wizard that cast spells, it's just that you have a limited choice and usage. The mobility rules are somewhat unintuitive since there is a lot of restrictions, but it gives a different flavor to the game. Mobility and terrain now becomes more important which is something interesting. For example, you could guard a bridge more easily.

The main flaw of this game is that the defender is simply invincible. This occurs for many reasons. First, the defender roll first and apply the casualties first. Second the attacker is limited in the amount of units he can send on each hex side. Third, the battle does not continue from round to round (You cannot send troops and support them on your next turn). Fourth, the players can reinforce (heal) their units anywhere on the board. 

So the only way to capture a city is to have A) an overwhelming force, B) Surround your enemy and attack invade all the same hex at the same time. This has the consequence of making the game very long with little progress and feedback for the players.

Else, the game is just a army clash. There is not really any civilization development and expansion. Both armies face each other on a front and attack each other.

Finally, the packaging for the 2nd edition is really weird. Each player only have 8 units per faction which force the players to buy additional expansion packs which only supply 3 units per factions. So you would need to buy 4-5 expansion pack to get a decent army. At least in the first version, you only get 2 factions but with 25 units each.

So the game looked interesting, but in my point of view, you would at least need a variant to make the defender less invincible just to make sure the game is playable. Else, I would have like to have a light civilization development in it, a bit like Viktory 2. Else, I think that people which are used to block games would actually like to play this. I cannot compare it to other block games since I have not played many.

I really enjoy the fog of war aspect of block games.  This one has a lot of flexibility in the many maps and armies available.  I also like the fantasy theme.  The big downside is the DIY nature of scenarios--the scenario included with the rules is wholly inadequate and bland.  The upside is you can download a big book of home-brewed scenarios from Columbia Games.  

Even so, I haven't been able to play this one very many times as a consequence of not only having to be up on the rules set, but also to pick out a scenario that looks interesting and matches the armies and maps I have available.  Whatever you do, don't play the base scenario--blah!

Update:  I tried out the Raid scenario and it is great!  We played Viksyn vs. Khurdak.  I'd recommend it as a starting scenario for two players.  I want to try out others now that I have all the armies and maps.

Also tried the Hell's Cargo scenario with Jurdak and Eldryn.

An early purchase and attempt to bring wargaming to the table.  Appealing variety of maps and units included and available, although I am disappointed that the second run boosters are blind assortments rather than full army sets.  Good fog of war and block mechanics, as per Columbia's usual block games.  Unfortunately, over-complicated ruleset, relative to the games being played at the time frustrated and led to a sale.  Summoner Wars fills the same spot in a collection without much of the fiddly rule overhead.

Basically a CCG in war game form.  You've got to have a lot of pieces to have fun with it.  I own both the original and second editions of this game + a huge lot of blocks which makes a big difference.  Don't waste your money on random boosters, get a collection from Ebay like I did. 

The game-play decisions are surprisingly deep.  Even a game run on a tiny map can last hours because of the huge amount of tactical decisions.  A novice player may get bogged down in the movement rules which can be frustrating, but with patience and time one begins to see the beauty in it.

This game continues to grow on me.  In many ways it's superior to Space Empires 4X.  It's definitely more thematic and strategic, and adding in a few house rules like expanded cities and lair monsters really help. 

This game reminds me of Dennis L McKiernan's "The Iron Tower" trilogy and it's a great read to get you in the mood for an epic war against a horde of undead (which I always play as).

Well, glad to have a chance to try it.  Did not strike me as compelling as Hammer of the Scots.  The armies we used were too balanced, and perhaps the map configuration was not conducive to a good game, but we were so evenly matched that after playing three hours, I had managed (once) to take and hold an opponent's city for one turn.  The two-figure over one border rule was a nuisance, and not sure I understand why the rule is there.  Lack of sea movement for the elves really handcuffed me.  No real need to play again, but would if asked.

Out of the box it's not perfect (since it really shines with certain expansion pieces) but even with its "flaws" I still love it. This game has so much potential for fantasy fans I have to recommend it.  It has great flexibility with the many combinations of armies, maps, and scenarios. The rule set is easy to tweak to your own liking.  With some creative effort you can get a lot of mileage out of this excellent, light wargame. This game has a lot to do with maneuvering, bluffing and use of terrain which is why it appeals to me I suppose.  Keep in mind, I'm a game tinkerer, so games like this that have a 'kit' factor have a high appeal for me.  Easy to add lots of different scenario rules without breaking the game.

After a couple of solo plays, I find this game to be enjoyable, but repetitious. While the different armies and units and creatures do add flavor to the game, it does boil down to somewhat of a dice-fest. Rules are generally clear and well-written; and I just love blocks. The blocks definitely give a boost to the game's rating. Some armies are clearly weaker than others (Amazons, for example).

UPDATE:  Honestly, with all the other games I want to play, when am I going to fit in the time to play this dated Frankenstein's monster?  Anwer: never.  If I want to play with variable block armies with a system that actually works, I'll wait for diBerardino's upcoming La Victoire.

Played a few games at just the time when a bunch of knowledgeable players offered compelling variants and CG was starting their own re-vamp of the system.  

The games were fine, but not compelling, and certainly not as good as CG's best.  I'm not sure what the renowned Chris Farrell saw in this game, but I will always give him and CG the benefit of the doubt.  Will hopefully play with last version 1 rules and then the new version 2.

Hmmm... Played one of the scenarios from the base game and my friend said he wanted to like the game but it might be the worst game he ever played.  During this session, I couldn't disagree with him.  It seems like winning the initiative is a disadvantage because the second player can simply react to any moves.  Also, the armies felt samey and symmetrical. On the other hand, I played a game years ago that was quite fun.

I have enjoyed block wargames and approached this with a hopeful attitude but was let down badly by it.  The games tries to much and does not have a coherent narrative to go with it unlike for example Battlelore with the Uchronia setting.  Random purchases of boosters does not help either.  I don't want to play again.

Rating 3: Will strongly resist playing

Not bad.  Pieces are cheap, but I do love Columbia block games.  Game play is pretty nice, where quantity rules over quality.  Dice based combat, over a hex map.  Maps are confusing and rules need to be better written, but could be a great game with a little more production. Stages into multi players pretty easily, but you do need the expansions.  According to others it's brilliant if you play multi player.  Too bad more people aren't going to be playing this one, but it is really reccomended.

RATING: 7
The game system for "Wizard Kings" is very much like Columbia Games' "Victory: Blocks of War," so if you don't like that you're probably not going to like this. Additionally, because this is supposed to be a fantasy battle game, the tendency of this gaming system toward defensive, static battles handicaps it further, as one would expect fantasy characters to have exceptional powers that make battles more exhilarating. 

On the other hand, as with "Victory: Blocks of War," I'm not bothered by the idea that this is more of a 'kit,' with a limited number of scenarios, because I like to set up my own scenarios and try different approaches regarding starting strength, make-up of races, unequal starting points, and so on. 

Given that "Wizard Kings" is a block game, it's not as cool-looking as other fantasy battle games such as "Battlelore" or "Heroscape". After all, it's just stickers placed on different-colored wooden blocks. So  essentially it's a block war game with magical spell powers thrown in, played out on various interchangeable maps that include elements pertaining to those magical powers. Actually, if the fantasy aspect of battle was an inventive as the map features (e.g., castles on islands in the middle of lakes, or temple areas from which wizards can evoke special powers), I'd be more enthusiastic about this game. That is, it's a low-complexity war game that allows for player creativity, but the game system doesn't tend to allow for the type of quick-hitting, rapidly decided outcomes one would expect from a fantasy war game. So, as designed, "Wizard Kings" comes up short, necessitating the challenge of coming up with some variants that work. On that note, one can to to the Columbia Games website to download numerous player-created scenarios that might act to fulfill the game's promise. 

I'm still searching for a personal approach in playing it that's satisfying. What's lacking in my experience with the game is a sense of wonder or fun in playing it out. 

Columbia has made more two additional races sets available since the base set came out. races available beyond the one--random--expansion set.  Given this game system and maps, especially with the combat rules that tend to favor the defender, it tends to work better with more rather than fewer pieces. Still even with additional units, I find my game play to be very cautious because of the defensive nature of the system, whereas it seems to me that in a fantasy game, battles should be more free-wheeling and wide-open.

Maps 1-4 come with the basic game. I purchased the game new, along with Expansion Maps 5-8, plus the expansion block set, January 2011. Added maps 9, 10, and 11 in February of 2011. Added a second expansion set of blocks, February 2012. Added "Ancient Kings" expansion block set, spring 2012.

In some ways this game is a 10...components, imagination, armies.  The many online scenarios are interesting...all the moreso because they mostly all have special rules.

This game is quite fun. Like a very light version of some of the war games I have played. The board is inter-connectable and can be laid out as you desire. Some of the scenarios are a little unbalanced, but it is made to be a challenge for one side. It also plays fairly well with more then two, although it is hard to hide your pieces, so just play with people who don't cheat.

RATING: 6
Innovative idea with the hidden units and I like the hexside limit idea.  The begginer scenario is kinda pointless and doesn't offer much in good gaming.  Expansion units are nice but not much difference in the units from race to race.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Bought this game on a whim and I must say I'm not disappointed. Within  a few months I've tripled the faction pieces count (via the heroes and treasure expansions) and now own all 16 (I think) geomorphic maps.

Simple 8 page rulebook, clearly and concisely written.

The artwork on the blocks is nice although the giant does look more like an angry 10 year old dressed like little boy blue. Maps are somewhat attractive but definately functional although I would love to see some 3D generated versions of the original maps although that isn't really columbias style (not that that's necessarily a bad thing since some games can be too 'busy')

I believe this is the second 'blocks of war' style game after Victory and in a way it does suffer from the same stalemate problems mentioned in that game. However, whereas in Victory stalemates can generally be ended within a few build turns by mass production of aircraft and ships (for 1PP each) this game relies almost entirely on land based units with few fliers and even fewer ships (although some magic can help). Yes it can depend on the maps but some units seem too expensive for what resources are available in the cities (partially remedied in part by gold and silver expansion blocks).

This however is a minor criticism since I have had many dynamic games too with whole swathes of land changing hands in epic battles involving various 'unholy' alliances.

Setup time is relatively quick for most games and the playtime isn't too long for 2 competent players.

For my high fantasy fix I would generally choose this over Descent most times - although setup time is a major factor for much of my gaming

This might become my new favorite go-to battle game.  I like the different troop types and the ease of setup.  I love block games, I just find them super cool.  I look forward to trying it out with multiple players, that's where most of my battle games suffer, maybe this one would be different.

It is a wargame kit similar to Victory.  Good, strategic decisions required and short (it can be played in under 2 hours.)  Much better than Dragon Dice. I would rate it higher if there were senarios that were interesting. Everything is here and it appears to be a great idea but the senarios just fail.

Easily my favorite war game for the time being.  My only complaint is "psuedo collectable" nature of the game.  Sure, you can do it all with the base set, but man do those Vikings look cool...

Update 05/08:  Sure do miss playing this, but what I don't miss are the laser-folded maps.  Barring some kind of heavy plastic, it's impossible to keep things where they were.  Probably never find anyone else to play this with me, but I do remember enjoying it tremendously.

A realy good game with simple mechanics, great theme and real fun.
I appreciate its multiplayer capacity since is rather rare for a wargame.
My nte is not really high for two reason : the first is the middle (and cheap) level of the game material (thin and ugly maps) and the second but most important the "collectible game" concept that forces you to buy and buy and buy again lot of expansion boxes to constitute real armies...
Shame because the game itself, i repeat is a very good one.

I would give this game a rating of 8.5 or 9 if it had better rules.  Columbia games seems incapable of blind testing, and there are always bugs & problems with their rules.  (Just one example: what do you do if you have 2 wizards left in a hex, neither one wants to retreat and each is at one step?  Under printed rules, the battle runs forever as neither can attack or cast spells.)

It is a shame that the scenario the comes with the game is so dull.  If you buy the game make sure to get the scenarios off the Columbia Games web site.  (Some more are also on fan sites.)  

Having said the above, I've played the game many times and really enjoy it.  Have not had the stalemate problems others have.  We play with a strict time limit and who ever has the most cities at the end wins.  (This forces people to put their heads down and jump in.)
  
UPDATE: If I used the new rules that Columbia Games have posted, my rating would drop to a 6.  I strongly recommend that you stick with the 1.5 rules version.  (We use 1.5 but say that no one can retreat during the first full combat round.)

I like the combat mechanics a lot.  However, all of our battles quickly degenerated into a thin battle line.  Once one player got behind, they had little way to recover their position, but the game dragged on towards its inevitable end.

For 2 players, we preferred Hammer of the Scots by far.

Ein schon etwas älteres Columbia-Blockgame in einem Fantasy-Universum: Bis zu sieben Spieler (und also bis zu sieben Fantasy-„Rassen“, von Zwergen über Untote und Elfen bis zu Amazonen etc.) kämpfen auf immer wieder anders (je nach Szenario) zusammengesetzten, modularen Karten um die Vorherrschaft bzw. um die Erfüllung szenariospezifischer Siegbedingungen. Jeder Spieler setzt sich seine Truppe nach Übereinkunft oder Szenario-Vorgabe individuell zusammen und hetzt sie auf den Gegner, sichert sich aber auch Städte, weil (fast) nur in ihnen Truppen nachgebaut werden können. Die Regeln sind simpel, die Kämpfe kurz und knackig, besonders wenn Wizards oder Clerics mit rassenspezifischen Zaubersprüchen anwesend sind; einzig die Bewegungsregeln mit ihren sogenannten Hexside-Limits (wie viele Truppen dürfen über welche Hexfeld-Grenze?) bedürfen ggf. einer kurzen ‚Eingewöhnungszeit‘.

Provisional rating after one play where I got my ass handed to me. I made several mistakes, most notably the two-map orientation (my choice as the orc player) where I picked a narrow path and exposed my two least defensible cities to attack. Playing defensive didn't seem to work. Playing aggressive didn't seem to work. Pixies and wizards flew all over my backyard, stole my gold, and ambushed the occassional orc. I'm not sure what happened, I had that weak a grip on the game. We played 1.5 rules, so maybe I played it a little too much like Hammer of Scots. Rating will settle after another game or two.

Doubtless got some rules wrong and the scenario we played was probably fairly unbalanced, but as a gaming _system_ I reckon this has a fair bit going for it, although gets a bit fiddly trying to squeeze all those big wooden blocks onto those too-small hexes.

Would go back for more though.

It's a very much overlooked game in my opinion that allows multi-player wargame interaction.

UPDATE: [u]My rating is for the old version.[/u]  The new version comes with the 1-2 chits from Columbia Dixie card game series and seemingly requires resource values to be allocated to that specific location, making the back map cities appear more useless.  Resource allocation shouldn't have to make perfect sense in a land inhabited with magic.  In my opinion this slows the game down and makes it much too tedious. Most of the new units seemed okay, but there didn't seem to be nearly enough cannon fodder troops.  The stacking limit now seems to be 4 instead 6 plus a wizard, preventing really big battles.  Furthermore, the defender has to retreat after three rounds of combat.  The defender already seems to have a strong advantage.  I tend to forget how weird the maps in this game can be. All the water areas can just be too damn annoying. I think making your own maps would be best unless you can utilize the Barbarians or something that can use those wild coastland areas.  I think some of the movement allowances have increased a bit too.  If you play the game with fewer troops and quirky rules, the game feels more like Chess.  That's usually not what I want.

I really wanted to like this game, I have only played the as a 2 on 2 set up.  I feel that perhaps it is difficult to judge the game until you've explored all the different ways to play it, but I have no problem saying that the set up that I played wasn't much fun.

In the 4 player game your partner sits on the same side of the table as you.  The two of you move forward as two different fronts. There will always be a natural ocean in the center of the board so movement diagonally between quadrants is eliminated.  What you are left with for the most part are two simultaneous two player games, unless one player can break through.  In the meantime the landscape creates bottlenecked fronts where turn after turn you slam into each other hoping that this will be the time your dice roll well for you.  For the most part little progress is made until one person gets bad luck on the dice.

Outside of buying units (which is really where the fun of Wizard Kings is), I never felt I was doing anything particularly clever.  The movement and ways to attack are severly limited by landscape and unit capability and any exceptions are limited by the dice you have (Pegasus). While not as static as Liberty, this game really fails to excite.

Then even with all of those things there is a serious problem with the rich getting richer, and likewise the poor losing their capability to react.

I'd try this one more time, but I'd never play it two on two, side by side again.

Oh how I love blockgames :O) Wizard Kings is easy to learn with lots opportunities in the way of strategy, scenarios and fantasy warfare. Go on and buy the bundle (and perhaps and extra set of chaos creatures) and your set with great armies and maps. This is worth it! Enjoy.

I'd been curious about block wargames for a while, so this was a natural choice when I found it inexpensively available in an auction.  I have yet to play it, and yes, I'd need another rules readthrough before I did.  As I recall, they weren't terribly complex.  The table footprint seems a bit large, which might be a problem, but this is still a game that I'm eager to explore.  It's a pity that it's gone to a collectable format with the new edition.  I'll have to do some research and see which version people are playing these days.

I am new to Wargames, and Wizard Kings certainly is a great game to start out with. Interesting tactical choices because of the very different units, exciting magic spells and a theme I love. The basic scenario is easily fixable; use the same number of troops, but play with two maps each instead of one. The scenarios are great too. Yay for Wizard Kings! :-)

For me to say that this is a kit game is nothing new. But how should you rate it since it's a kit?

This rating is for the default scenario of the game. So playing with a better scenario increases the score and a worse scenario decreases.

RATING: 6.5
This rating is for the first edition of Wizard Kings.

My biggest problem with this game is the basic scenario, which is pretty vanilla, and requires a fair amount of setup time, if the players customize their armies.  Columbia Games have remedied this flaw somewhat with the scenario booklet now available on their website.  While the several armies are nicely differentiated by their particular abilities and strengths, they all unfortunately feel like generic fantasy armies of elves, orcs, and dwarves, etc.

The second edition of the game looks like it has better art for the blocks (a definite plus), but has made the game collectable (to my mind, a minus).

I bought the first edition and all the expansion maps and armies (other than Ferkin) before the second edition came out.  It's a nice clean system which makes it great for beginning wargamers but complex enough to provide a large number of strategic decisions.  The hidden movement is great and always makes it exciting when you jump into a battle.

RATING: 5.5
Wizard Kings is a game filled with possibilities - 7 armies, playable up to 7, several maps and scenarios, unique units, spells, terrains, even were-things affected by the moon! Yet, everything is build over a sandcastle, which is the rule that the defense has the advantage. This leads to being good to just wait, reinforcing and waiting for an attack.

Without carefully crafted scenarios that push one or all sides to battle, there is little incentive to be bold. Thus the game suffers - it loses emotion and joy. It saddens me that so many games follow this route, when giving the upper hand to the attack often brings more entertainment, temerity and a little craziness to the plays.

In the absence of these scenarios  (as in here), you get turtling and plays in with just a few tentative attacks happen, in order to get the edge that gives the victory.

This is sad, since the amount of different units and their possibilities, the spells, the effect of terrains (for movement and battle), and much more falls to second place, when the most effective way to play is stay put, milking points, creating units, squeezing them in the key spots, and wait. Luckily, this sort of play is being, more and more, a relic from the past, with the current games preferring to give the edge to ambushes, number, terrain, experience, weaponry, etc, instead of the just awarding it to the defence - though it still happens, but alongside proper scenarios.

Therefore, overall, Wizard Kings have much on its side, but fails in entertaining the way it could. But one can always do a house rule - I recommend doing it in this case.

After playing this game four times (base game and 2 scenarios) I have to say that the game is very entertaining, and it is sufficiently different from Hammer Of The Scots to warrant a separate purchase. I feel that there is less strategy and more luck involved than in HOTS (the strongest armies can be decimated by a few scouts through a few lucky dice rolls), but the game plays more fluently, quicker, and is easier to explain. The game is a lot of fun, although I find the price quite high for what you get. Especially since you will definitely want to collect some of the expansions once you own the base game. As far as the base armies are concerned: Elves lost twice to the Orcs, and I feel that the Orc blocks and spells (Swarm!) are a little bit stronger overall.

I like the mechanics, components and gameplay of this game. I own both the first and second editions. Version 2.0 rules seem just fine to me... I like the attrition effects and the necessity of swapping units out of the line for replenishment. I may make my own gold and silver units for each faction tho. I wish Columbia would clear up the controversy over unit distribution in the randomized expansion boxes. I've hesitated to purchase additional boxes 'til I understand what's going on. I did get a personalized "hero", which I think is great fun! My play with v 2.0 so far(6/07)has been small map solitaire play, which works very well with this game.

RATING: 7
The base game right out of the box is not very good. It's collectible (a format I usually hate), the rules are sketchy (errata, fan-made variants and scenarios are immediately required) and the basic armies are too similar (several Heroes & Treasures expansion packs are needed to make the armies interesting)... but if you look at it as a retro-fantasy toolkit to roll your own variants and scenarios, it's actually quite charming. (For example: a 2-player, 4-map, 8-round, asymmetric attacker vs defender variant where you get double gp from occupied enemy cities at the end works nicely.)

Base game + all maps + several H&T packs + fan-made scenarios and variants + Chaos spells appropriated from the 1st edition + additional white blocks for Chaos units = 7/10. If they'd make a deluxe edition with all this in one big box, rating could potentially climb up to 9/10.

Esp. with the 2.0 release, I wish that the sides were truly asymmetrical.  I mean, are Elven Gladers essentially the same as Goblins?  Why not have Goblins dice total go 1-1-3-6 (still at C1) and Gladers be 2-2-3-3 (but at C2).  Or whatever: the point is that there could be palpable differentiation, but there isn't, and the game suffers for it, feeling too generic and too dry for a game with this theme.

Glad to see that 2.0 will have official and/or "standard" scenarios, so there's a concession to a common prior complaint. Still, without a change to the former issue, this doesn't tempt me a bit.

A lot of potential, but hamstrung by the company because of a lack of support.  Lack of scenarios is a killer for a "kit" game like this.  The basic scenario is bad, and attempts to improve it are not enough to salvage the base set.  A lot of fan created scenarios require expansion armies and maps.  The rules punish the attacker, encouraging turtling to a disheartening degree.  Some of the fan scenarios look quite good, but the cost of entry is prohibitive.

[comments on rules version 1.6]

I didn't realize just how different Wizard Kings was from the more "modern" Columbia games.

The pacing of the game, for starters, is much more thoughtful and drawn out.  Units have to be carefully chosen and built according to the initial map configuration and scenario goals.  Movement takes the form of precise maneuvering (inching along) so that attacking units are able to finesse their way past hex side limits and terrain chokepoints - all for the purpose of satisfying the magic stacking number (four blocks maximum, or five with a wizard) in the invaded hex.  And recall that [i]all[/i] blocks can move (did time just stop?), not just a few groups. Lastly, end-of-turn builds tack even more time onto an already deliberate game.

So yes, be prepared to spend an afternoon with this one.  Unless the worst happens and you discover that your chosen scenario isn't particularly balanced - so then the game gets called after only 30 minutes (which is less time than you spent on set-up) and you're wondering why you even bothered.  So choose your scenario carefully and be prepared to switch sides after a quick loss - making sure to tweak the set-up guidelines, maps, or win conditions (or all three) if things don't quite work out the first time.

Any other problems?  Sure. The base game comes with only two straightforward (i.e., non-island) maps, builds are driven by a rich-get-richer territorial control scheme, certain hexes have ambiguous terrain categorizations, and units that can ignore or increase hex side limits (flyers, amphibians) tend to dominate the game.  A frog and bird army can be an all-powerful menace - you'll see.

But there's cool stuff, too: spells, decisive battles, and a delicate tickling and taxing of the brain.  The only nagging doubt is that this may ultimately be a lifestyle game, and I ain't got the style that I used to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A simple game, but you really have to use all the rules, carefully, to make the most of it. The huge variety of units adds enormously to the attraction, but the collectable aspect is an evil plot against my bank balance...

I also don't like that all units are equally vulnerable to attacks. A Dragon has only 2 hits - so take along a horde of puny Goblins to absorb hits! Not very true to the source material...

1/1/12 -- Ultimately, I couldn't get over the game's encouragement of inactivity.  There needs to be some balancing factor to encourage more attacking (Titan is a great example of this).  People say this is a "kit" game, and that I can make my own scenarios.  Well, if I wanted to design my own game, I wouldn't have bought someone else's.  Dropping rating to a 5.

12/19/07 - (2nd edition) This game seems to HEAVILY favor defensive positions, which unfortunately means that it takes clever scenarios to stay interesting, since attacking is almost never advisable otherwise.  This also seems to discourage large force pools, as players will be more and more willing to turtle while they build up their available units instead of fighting and using their resources to mitigate losses (the much more interesting use of them).

Unfortunately, it appears as though most of the scenarios posted on Columbia's website use at least 1 map from the original 4, maps that a lot of first timers aren't going to have access to without additional cash investment into the game.  I think Columbia should have spent more time developing scenarios that are playable with the basic game's contents.  I guess I'll have to get creative...

I haven't yet played with any chaos or artifact units.  Looking forward to giving them a go, but I've felt hesitant to dedicate them to colored blocks without a basic understanding of how they might balance out the armies I've got.

9-20-07:  The original Wizard Kings was a big bomb, IMO.  I never tried any of the various scenarios though, so perhaps my problem was that my experiences were limited to the out-of-the-box game.  It pretty much sucked a big one.  WK2, on the other hand, seems to have tons of promise.  I went ahead and bought myself a copy and was pleased to see all of the races represented with fewer units each.  Additionally, the game contains actual scenarios now (although there are only 4, which is pretty lame considering that there are millions published on their site).  I feel like the game has improved immensely, and I recommend anyone who felt like WK1 sucked give WK2 a shot.

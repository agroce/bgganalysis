It is a little heavier than my normal fare, however, I like the rules and the close combativness. The small maps and the decisions to risk crossing that gap between the buildings and the forest make for heart pounding moments. I like the caps and the action points and the you move I move type of movement. 
I look forward to playing this quite a bit more

RATING: 6
Based on an introductory infantry scenario.  I'll upgrade as I get more into the system.

Overall, it is fun.  The variable command points are the best part and create a level of tension and management.  I am not a fan of spent units standing still while they are charged - it seems gamey.  I guess [thing=41429][/thing] spoiled me on that lack of realism.

But beyond that (a problem in most tactical infantry games), it is a good game with sharp looking components.

RATING: 7
I like the rule improvements of SoS over AtB very much indeed. The solo firefights are also fun to play, one really feels one is playing on one side against the enemy, rather than having to play both sides. Only tried the smaller scenarioes: I would like to play some of the bigger 2+ player scenarios.

(Note to self: Almost everything except the replaced reference sheets is now removed from this box and in the Price of Honour box. So take Price of Honour to play any SoS firefights.)

The weight and pace drag this down a bit, and the solo is kinda lame, but still an excellent game.

RATING: 9
This feels like old school Squad Leader without all the "itty bitty" rules.
3D graphics always have that flat lazy feel.  And the Conflict of Heroes title seems a bit bilious.  I'm pretty sure most soldiers are more interested in survival than heroic acts..   
But the rest of this game is very very elegant.  I love the limited intelligence chit pull hit system.  The action point mechanic keeps play dynamic and despite my misgivings of the board art, the rest of the production and rule book is wonderful..

Though probably easy compared to other wargames, very thinky for me, especially compared to C&C Ancients, though that's not a bad thing in my eyes.
Wargame strategy is something that will certainly come with time, the win is usually decided by someone who didn't err.
And Russians shooting only once per activation can be frustrating....but I am sure the balance bears it out.

We have yet to make our way all the way through the rules/scenarios with this (which kills me... I got this for the tanks!), but it's still very good.  This is the game to pick up if you're interested in war games, but don't want to stray too far from Euros.  All the war game concepts are there (LoS, fire groups, going to ground, etc) but the action point system that runs the whole thing is closer to a Euro.  The cards add some nice uncertainty, and the components to this one are quite attractive.  For me, Combat Commander is the better and more exciting game, simply because it's less abstracted - at least, playing CC feels like battle, with grinding and plenty of chaos.  In all likelihood, this one will come out more though.  A nice, elegant system, and yes, unlike CC it has vehicles!

A good game system though the usual limit of 5 turns per firefight does mean the attacker needs to throw caution to the wind in order to achieve objectives within the timeframe of the game.

I look forward to a Stalingrad expansion but I hope the maps will look suitably urban and ruined. Stalingrad would really lend intself to small scale skirmishes that CoH does so well.

My criterion for rating games

http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1) Sense of wonder: This is the one area of this game that I don't care for and the reason I'm not a huge fan of "true" wargames. I do not feel like this game offers a lot of difference from game to game. If you play the same scenario again it feels exactly the same. There is very little that differentiates one game to the next. One of the few things it does have going for it is the cards which provide some changes, but not enough for me.

2) Meaningful/fun decisions.  Tons of hard decisions all the way until the end of the game. The management of Action points make the decisions even more plentiful and tough.

3) Player interaction: Players killing each other. My favorite kind of interaction!!!

4) Components/artwork: Very nice boards and tiles. The artwork on the tiles is very good and I live the look of the box, rulebook, and overall game.

5) Game length/complexity:  Can take a bit too long for my taste as there is a lot to consider on each turn. The complexity of the game means that you will be stopping from time to time to check the rulebook. I have not got to a point where I am without rulebook look ups. This slows the game down even more. Would prefer a slightly shorter game for what it is.

RATING: 7
One play (besides a learning solo) with only half the rules; so far, no armored vehicles, air support, etc. A very sleek little system that captures a lot of flavor with very little rules overhead. The low counter-density of most scenarios, the short game-lengths of five or six turns in most scenarios, the quick I-go-you-go impulses, and the very streamlined table of modifiers all translate into a pretty fast and furious little package. A very tentative rating of 7. I think a lot of well-thought-of wargames are going to land in the upper tier of mediocrity for me, not because they are less than great games, but because I am discovering that randomness is a glass ceiling, given my preferences. Oddly, I really enjoy wargames with no luck but a modicum of uncertainty generated through hidden information or simultaneous action. Napleon's Triumph is a good example of the former and Diplomacy is a good example of the latter. Even Sekigahara, with its card draws and consequent hand management is likely to be more appealing to me in the long term than most CRT-based games. Another nuance of the issue is that, even though the typical wargame isn't going to rank particularly high as a 'boardgame' (as defined as an interesting problem and a contest of skill), it might be something that I'm attracted to as an experience; the asymetry, the variety of scenarios, the historical flavor, and - yes - the luck, all really excite a different part of my brain.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.2
This game has rather complex rules to capture a lot of realism. Even though you can play most scenarios without knowing all of the rules, it is likely that something will slip your mind, especially when playing solo missions.

Dice rolling and card drawing make the game quite random and solo missions have rules that are flat-out unfair to increase the difficulty. Unfortunately, the action is highly static, so the element of luck becomes very important here - more than I personally like.

The number of units in each firefight is limited and solo firefights hardly contain any vehicles to use. Range may be historically accurate, but also means that line of sight is the main thing to determine what you can hit, as you can easily shoot across half the board with most units without a penalty.

The components are generally of decent quality, but the box and player sheets are mediocre at best.

Slightly disappointed by the scenarios a little bit, the play balance doesn't seem right. The scenarios may be historical, but the victory points may need to be tweaked a little bit. Most scenarios feature one side crossing open ground to unseat an entrenched defender...no easy task.

Beautiful components. I can think of many other wargames that deserve this treatment.

I have not played it yet, but I am going to give it a 10 for the diptard that gave it a 1 because people were rating it before it came out. You rating it a 1 is just as crazy as people rating it a 9 or 10 before it came out and for me giving it a 10 because of your inane 1. Here's to craziness!

Perhaps two wrongs will make a right?"

Hence, my comment about the CRAZINESS of this kind of crap!" Also, at least own the damn game, have read the rules, and seen first hand the beautiful components.

- edit I have actually played it a few times. I would probably give it a 9. It is better than Awakening the Bear and the rules have been cleaned up. I will stick with my 10 for now, since it seems to stick into at least a couple people's craw.

I should play this more- it is a good Euro/Wargame hybrid... thing.  The components are great and the rulebook is easily implemented.  I don't like the way it breaks up the action into UGO/IGO one unit at a time and it seems to revolve around one player waiting for the opponent to use up all action points on one of their units so they can move in close to take them out.  It is more of a game than a portrayal of realistic WWII tactics.

Conflict of Heroes is a gorgeous game. The rules seem clear enough and are pretty simple to teach. This game feels a bit like chess and I am not a huge fan of that kind of gameplay in a war themed game. This is a great game but the gameplay is a bit of a let down for me personally.

A very fun, cool, and accessible war game.  The counters are huge, and very easy to read.  The mechanics, very simple.  I really like this game, but I like Nations at War:White Star Rising just a little bit better.  Maybe because I own it, maybe because I won decisively my first play - I don't know.  I just know what I like. 

Anyway, this is one I'd be willing to play again and again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A well produced accessible tactical wargame. A good way of introducing someone interested in the concept to WWII tactical gaming without scaring them with ASL. Ultimately it doesn't offer quite as much as ASL in terms of flexibility, scale or realism (whatever that means in the context of pretending cardboard counters are actual military units trying to kill each other - but I know what I mean).

It almost overdoes the production values - the counters are too big and obscure the entire contents of the hex. Overlays are too chunky making it hard not to regard the thickness as some form of relief/hill indication (which it sometimes is).

Still a fun game and easy to get into - but as an ASL player it is hard not to compare it to the latter and find it a somewhat pale (though slick and streamlined) imitation.

SOLD - I would always prefer to play ASL over this and if I needed something simpler I would go with Combat Commander.

* New boards and counters are more detailed, clearer and more vivid.
* Out of the box, it has firefights specific for 1,2,3 and 4 players, with new fleshed-out solitaire rules
* Updated rules system that is both more streamlined and more realistic.
* Board overlays that add a huge amount of map variability
* More action cards and new type of cards (Veteran cards)
* New units and weapons such as snipers, airplanes, rockets, and flamethrowers
* New terrain and fortifications, such as balkas, rivers, tank ditches, and gun pits

RATING: 8.5
A great WWII tactical game. There are tons of options/units and the firefights add progressively more complex rules. (very similar to the way Earth Reborn handles it.)
Overall, the game rules are fairly easy to digest but the rulebook could have been organized better. (Some of the simple rules are presented in a daunting way, numbers, charts, abbreviations...a 'casual' gamer will run from this!)
The components are stunning for a war game. Beautiful rulebook(s), thick cardboard maps (x4!), large, easy to read/distinguish counters. I wish the AP/Score boards were mounted, but I won't get too greedy.
The scenarios are diverse and interesting. Once you start playing both sides will have to make bold, tense moves. This also handles solitaire play well...particularly if you use the random AP rule. ;) (In which the game forces the use of CAP usage.)
I love the chit pulls for unit damage as well! I think it works amazingly well...much more exciting than, "roll dice, compare numbers, remove counter." It gives your units a more realistic fighting chance!

CONS: The map hexes need to be larger...I hate that the counters just BARELY fit into them. (It's hard to read the hex numbers during setup.) Stacking is also a bit tedious. Each of the firefights adds different rules/units/special options...this is great for diversity and makes the game modular, but it also makes it take quite a bit of time to set up.

Until CoH came along, I doubted anyone could challenge ASL as my favorite tactical war game.  I love the big tiles and beautiful map boards.  The player aids are fantastic as well.  The command and control aspect is neat, as well as the cards for unexpected surprises to drop on your opponent.  

Uwe is one of my favorite designers, primarily because he is so responsive to his customers.

After playing this I realised that it is as gamey as, and it leads to situations far less verisimilar than, Memoir 44, so why bother.
On the component site, this is clearly a nice, attractive and practical game as far as hex and counter games go.

RATING: 5
Over the years this game dropped from 10 to now 5, you can read my sobering up below.

___________________________________
Breaks my heart, but although it strayed were no wargame strayed before, some of it's mechanics are.. stupid.
Foremost the fact that if an opponent has no cards or CPs left & his unit is spent you can walk up to it and kill it. That is so fucking stupid. But to be honest atm there isn't anything better out.. neither BoB or other mid-weight squad level war games.

_______________________________________
The not so good communication of the designer about release dates and such & the lack of support concerning new scenarios/replayability (you basically have to make up a lot of stuff on your own) let it drop down to 9.. but still a very good game.

________________________________________
I have waited for a game like this for a long time.
I love the combined forces squad level scope & the rich tactics you can apply.
But what is revolutionary about this game is it's system.. with it, it accomplishes a constant tenseness & involvement of all participating players, because of the simultaneous play & the various activation possibilities it is a constant back-and-forth.. a probing, stalling & then a full blown commitment to attack.. so far no other game i know of has accomplished that.

Add to that the hidden movement system, the (for you) unknown damage you brought on your foe & the optional hidden Action Point dice roll.. hence a feeling of uncertainty looms over the battlefield and what feeling could be better suited for a wargame. :)

The only one change i would want, is a customizable map-tile system combined with a point-cost-system for the units, because although the maps are stunningly beautiful, i want the possibility to create my own battles with "unfair" terrain features.
But i will be creating those on my own for now.

An upgraded version of CoH which implements a one-action-at-once design intended to eliminate the 'dance of death' issues with the original. Recommended with one important house rule: neither side should be allowed to 'pass' on their turn. There's a good selection of units, but I can't believe that a re-creation of the Battle of Kursk fails to include the Ferdinand tank destroyer. The scenarios seem a bit uninspired, they're either infantry only or very tank heavy with just a few squads in support. As a substantial improvement over the first game, the series seems headed in the right direction.

A few rules changes one of which makes the game even more interactive. Compared to the somehow blurry images of the first game, the counters are much nicer (also the maps). 15 scenarios are included, some can be played solitaire.

This is a very addictive game. Easy to set-up, fast playing (90-120 min. for the smaller scenarios) and full of tough choices for both players. Excellent design!

RATING: 8
Conflict of Heroes is a very good tactical system that combines many aspects of more complex wargames, including attention to historical detail, with Euro-style playability and game length. It offers more of a wargame experience than the Commands and Colors system, albeit at the expense of a longer set of rules. 

I have played most of the earlier Storms of Steel scenarios that use only a subset of the full rules. They are very good for learning the game, but with small numbers of units on each side chance can sometimes play too significant a role. I also doubt whether many of these scenarios will be worth playing more than a couple of times, as the tactical possibilities are limited. The later scenarios tend to be on a larger scale and better utilise the potential of the system.

This is probably the most accessible tactical war game that i ever had the pleasure to play.
It plays really fluid and you get a good feeling on what it must have been like to have been a part of these battles.
If you are looking for a war game with some depth to it, but don't want to jump into the deep end (like asl) then this might be the perfect solution.
I should also mention that the quality of the components is probably the best i have ever seen in a modern war game.

I bought Conflict of Heroes: SoS because I felt that Memoir '44 - although a very good game - is a bit too shallow and random for me. CoC's relatively simple rules and short gameplay promised a good alternative for a more serious wargame. I've read the rules and only played the first scenario twice, but it looks very promising. The action and command points give a nice twist to activating and using your units. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Scenarios seem weaker to me for Storms of Steel than those included in Awakening the Bear.  There is also some very poor history on offer (such as SS units fielding Panthers when they did not have them historically).  Game play wise, all the numbers are bigger than in the earlier games, but that doesn't necessarily make things more interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Excellent game.  Better than Tide of Iron IMO.  More dynamic and faster flowing.  Shared activations and group moving/firing/rallying/etc are innovative ideas and add to the tension.  The Germans have to be careful to use their superior equipment to good advantage or be overun by the Russians.  Tension is usually quite high.  Wanted to run away with my German units when facing a numerically superior horde of Russians. My orders were to defend the village.  Hidden snipers had my HMG's pinned. What to do?  I held on for an unlikely win by 2 points. Really like the cards at the players disposal too. Solitaire is excellent and the 'doctrines' make the AI quite challenging.  Love this game.
12th Sept 2010
Starting to love this game a little less. I'm finding most of the scenarios unbalanced.  I don't want a puzzle that my mate and I have to figure out. I want balanced scenarios where anyone could win.  Still really like the system. Am currently searching for a point buy system for units so we can do our own balanced scenarios.  Tide of Iron has a point buy system. Revised score to an 8.
30th May 2012
Don't like this game. Want to, but don't. The shared activitions annoy both me and my player buddy. We enjoy more straight forward WW2 like Band of Heroes. It's such a shame because what you get in the box is excellent production quality and bits and pieces. Really loathe the scenarios. Only 1 or 2 are any good. Making our own scenarios wasn't enough to save this game. Trying to sell on Ebay.

RATING: 8
I was in the skeptical camp when it came to Uwe's fairly continual postrelease tinkering with the AtB rules and the moderate revamp of them reflected in SoS, particularly since the changes to some degree invalidated the AtB counters, diminishing backward compatibility. Nevertheless, SoS represents a substantial out-of-the-box improvement over AtB in terms of rules clarity and speed of interactivity. Simply making every "thing" be the one and only one action the active player can perform radically streamlines the game over the use-all-7AP-but-maybe-suffer-an-interrupt that imbalanced the AtB-type menu of possible actions. The set adheres to the same quality standards as AtB, which is saying a lot. Support for the CoH games remains extraordinarily high. The downside of SoS and AtB for me is that they both feel gamey and generic. Perhaps I just need to play the larger scenarios, where loss of one unit isn't quite so catastrophic, but the abstraction of command into CAPs smooths game play but at the cost of on-the-map presence of leaders. If the Combat Commander series arguably places too much emphasis on leaders, CoH renders the concept almost out of existence.

RATING: 4
Tactical WWII East Front wargame that didn't live up to my Squad Leader-based expectations. My thoughts on the game in a few brief notes:

1. The large counters and hexes contribute to the game's chunky feel. I don't like the infantry units looking like stubby toy soldiers pointing their rifles in random directions; vehicles are somewhat better. The maps are fine (though effectively fairly small) and overlays help break up uniform landscapes.

2. Combat results are very chunky, as the compound effect of losing a unit is a big deal and you don't have a lot to begin with. The dominant strategy is to focus fire and seek kills at any opportunity; if a scenario turns it is typically because of a couple of lucky or unlucky rolls.

3. The use of CAPs and action cards feels abstract, gamey and often automatic. You are always happy to draw cards that give you extra actions, and using them whenever you have a chance to achieve or prevent a kill is a given. Other cards are situational or carry a steep opportunity cost, so they are dead in your hand. A few rules feel heavy-handed, counter-intuitive and/or thematically ambiguous, notably the stacking disincentive, the panicked status, and CAPs overall. Designer notes are helpful but sometimes leave the feeling that they're rationalizations after the fact, invoking the chaos of war to justify any resulting level of simulation granularity.

4. The first five scenarios felt samey and uneven and didn't leave much room for strategizing within the time and space constraints. Basically they all boil down to everyone standing and shooting at each other, followed by the attacking side advancing towards objectives if possible. I didn't get to play with armour, but a tactical game should be able to do infantry combat well.

RATING: 3
Has lot of gaps in realistic. Author is claiming that he took many factors into design but then there are lot of mechanics which feel too arbitrary and without any logic behind them. In the end it was huge disappointment. Lot of units have weird statistics. Cards are adding only more randomness to system they even do not have any flavor (or at least name with some flavor) to add to game.

Outstanding game! I own both this and CoH AtB, and the quality of this game is better, and I didn't think that could happen, crisper maps and beautiful oversized counters.

RATING: 8
I have a very favorable impression after playing this.  The revised rules (from Awakening the Bear first edition) really improve gameplay.  The big change is that players alternate taking actions with units, which makes the game much more interactive and affords better opportunities to react to the other player's move.

CoH is an intermediate complexity wargame.  It plays fast, has great components and is very interactive.  A very nice tactical treatment of WWII eastern front action.

Game with lots of variable tactical problems and ways to solve them. This in addition to manageable rules and fast-paced scenarios makes this game a unique Cosim. Planes are introduced in SoS.

Great fun.  GREAT components, love the art and the sturdiness of the counters and maps.

RATING: 8.5
This is a great game.  I started war-gaming way back in jr high with Squad Leader and eventually worked my way up to ASL....but eventually found fewer and fewer player who could play the system.

This game scratches that same itch, and in my opinion does a better job of it.  While having a decent amount of complexity, it can be relatively easy to teach.  High lights of this system:
- very flexible and interactive turns: I go, you go
- hidden damage via chits 
- hidden options via cards
- simpler system (not easy, but manageable) 

In my plays so far, I have mostly played the scenarios with few to medium unit density, and so it will be interesting to see how the game holds up in the larger battles.
Rating Change: 10->8.5 too many big scenarios with lots of tanks would prefer small number of units with mixed types of units

Enjoyed this game immensely until I discovered the scenarios are like puzzles, once you find the proper combination/tactic for the forces in the scenario you simply execute this over and over with little variation. This in turn drives the replay ability down. From a 10 to  a 6.

Rule changes make this addition to the Conflict of Heroes line even better than the original Awakening the Bear version.

This is a nigh-on perfect game for me - it just scratches so many itches. It's historical, yet it's also multi-player. It can be a brain burner yet it's also a thrilling random ride. It's got bags of narrative and sim-feel yet its accessible. In comparison to Awakening the Bear (the predecessor game) this version has more scenarios, better solo play, clearer more streamlined rules, and more varied units. What's not to love? A probable 10 once I've tried out those multi-player scenarios.

[Update: Just played four games in a row in about 3 hours total, and I absolutely love the new turn-order mechanic.  This game is awesome.  Totally awesome.  All other games should be this game.  This is now a 10, straight up.]

This game is a follow-up to Conflict of Heroes: Awakening the Bear.  It has the same basic combat system, with one major change: instead of a single player taking all of their moves with a single unit before opposing player can respond, players now alternate moves.  So, instead of the Germans getting to walk their infantry all the way across the field without a response, the German infantry moves one square, and then the Russians get to do exactly one thing with one unit.  Then the Germans do one thing with one unit, etc.

This change is EXCELLENT, and makes the game much more dynamic.  I absolutely love the new rules, and won't go back to the old system (and, as a bonus, these new rules are completely compatible with Awakening the Bear).  

The game system overall is still the same, excellent squad-based tactical wargame.  I absolutely love it: the damage system is brilliant (draw hit counters that cause damage to your unit that your enemy doesn't know about), the maps and chits are wonderfully designed, and the scenarios have been great.  

While the game takes hours to play (especially if you're not familiar with the rules), they're great hours.

"I have not played it yet, but I am going to give it a 1 for the diptard that gave it a 10 because people were rating it before it came out. You rating it a 10 is just as crazy as people rating it 1 before it came out and for me giving it a 1 because of your inane 10. Here's to craziness!"

Only a few plays so far, but play seems dull and therefore I am selling my copy. 

Also I did not like the "you go, I go" mechanic involved as well as the way the game forces you to have only one unit activated at a time, it ruins the tactical aspect of the game for me.

Sold it.

RATING: 7
The game surprised me on the upside, expecting it to be way more complex for the size of the rule-book. And I guess it is if you load up the game with everything it's got - which is a great selling point for those who are getting right into it and want a full-on thematic overload. But for the amateurs out here amongst us, the starting scenarios are nicely constrained, low number of units, low number of rules, but enough to provide an engaging experience. I liked how you're concentrating on a unit at a time, avoiding the (unliked to me) move all and resolve all aspects of traditional wargames. It also introduces hard decisions on whether to waste unused actions on a unit if suddenly you need to do something with another unit. It means you need to enter a round with a plan as to where you'd like to be at the end of the round, but the to-ing and fro-ing between the players often causes re-thinking on the fly, with tactical vs strategic considerations the name of the game. It did seem very swingy on die rolls though - they're hit or miss, there's no gradation. And with low-unit-number scenarios, losing one on a low odds die roll can be a killer. So I thought that was a little out of kilter with the otherwise rich environment and decision making process the game offers - ie you can do all the right things, gain cover, etc, and you still get whacked when your opponent rolls the needed 11 on a lucky, I've-got-nothing-else-I-want-to-do-with-my-action-points throwaway type roll. On thus does swing the fortunes of war (in this world).

RATING: 9
The new mechanics are great!  Having simultaneous activated units improves on COH and creates a lot more strategy.  The scenarios are well designed with interesting objectives and not just 'kill everyone'.  Once again, the components are extremely high quality.  The scenarios seem a lot more balanced than AtB... no more 24-5 games.  And the addition of planes is very fun and adds to the strategy.

RATING: 8
Excellent product in terms of physical production and rules presentation and development.  This is a smooth, tested, top notch game, to me, in every way except one:

I don't like the system.  I can't say why exactly but it feels too much like a setup/contraption.  The action/spent dynamic is so repetitive and tedious, and the results aren't so much of tremendous interaction (the intent) but of endless micromanagement.  The CC system verges on the ridiculous, as spent units just absorb hits until they die and don't fight back.  

It all works as game when you put the pieces together, as strange as some of them are, but it works in a way that I don't find satisfying. 

So as wargaming product and professionalism I give this game a 10.  As a game I would like to play I give it a 4, so I am splitting the difference at 7.

RATING: 8
Not bad but not great either...at least so far. More plays will tell. Army composition, map, and scenario factor heavily into the enjoyability of a session. Some setups are more fun than others. 

Generally both you and your opponent need to be of a similar skill level or it's going to be a stomp fest. There are ways to compensate for this though.

Standard solo setup is a fairly static affair. It's more like a puzzle you have to figure out so I don't find it to interesting that way. Use other variants instead or simply play the other side as optimally as possible but straight forward.

I find the fun in this game on par with Memoir 44 so far. It's deeper and more deterministic than Memoir 44 but in the end it doesn't feel any more fun than it. My guess is that Band of Brothers is way to go for this type of tactical war board game.

edit: after more plays I'm starting to get into this. This series is more meaty than Memoir but still maintains a streamlined simplicity. Plays fast and is a good choice for people new to war gaming. It's more game than simulation, but from my perspective that's a good thing.

I'm enjoying it more now so I'm increasing my score to an 8. It's good, but not great (again this could change with time)

Very nearly a perfect game for me.  The rules changes since 'Awakening the Bear' (retrofittable to that game) addresses its two minor downsides: The level of analysis paralysis drops, and the so-called 'Panzerblitz syndrome' drops.  I never had very much problem with either, but Storms of Steel really brings the Conflict of Heroes system to maturity.  Awesome.

Excellent, excellent game.  It has everything, tanks, guns, planes, squads, all the WWII goodies.  Maps are beautiful, rules are one of the best out there.  And the rule book is one of the best out there, if not the best.  Everything is explained with examples.  I wish all war games had this type of rule book.  

It plays excellent solo too.  Nice big easy to read counters.  Lots of cool graphics on them too.

I rarely finished a whole 5 turns, which is all you get, because it became a blowout.  So the games won't last very long.  Tons of fun.

And it plays very quickly. Hardly need to look up rules just get it on.

RATING: 8
This is the game that made me want to play at the tactical level. Great balance between detail and playability. Rules are well written and modular. Moves well with players activating units, spending action points to advance, rally, and fire. Rolling for action points and keeping them secret until the end of a unit's activation adds a nice layer of unpredictability.

Now 9 plays in and still prefer the infantry or combined arms games to all armor scenarios. Would love to have a scenario builder for this game.

Wouldn't mind having the new 2nd Edition.

Game Play is amazing, the components are amazing, this  game truely is amazing! Cannot wait for the expansions to come out for this!  I really like how little down time there is between player moves.  There is so many plans withing plans within plans when developing a strategy for each scenario.  Sometimes weird gamey things happen (like playing ring-around-the-rosey with tanks in a town), but with straight-forward and easy rules, I can accept that once in a while.  Most of the time the game rewards good, solid tactics.

The hidden unit system is a bit cumbersome since you need a printed A4-paper of the map for each player. The stacking rules are a bit unrealistic and possibility for a huge stack doesn't make any sense. It's essentially a 2d6 dicefest with a bunch of cards and modifiers thrown into the mix. It may be a good beginner game and good intro the genre but I don't think it's worth the investment for a more experienced wargamer.

RATING: 6.6
Tactical combat in WWII. Its been done before and this game hasn't solved the basic problem which is finding a way to represent the simultaneous action, exchange of fire. lulls and rapid movements inherent in small-scale combats with fire-arms. The game uses an action point mechanism which works okay but does lead to some very odd situations. 

Not a bad game, in fact next to its competitors quite a good game, but it doesn't deliver on what it is intended to simulate. Still waiting for a game that does.

Wonderful 2 player squad/platoon level WW2 combat game. More game-y than simulation for purist grognards, but I feel that the balance and abstraction of mindless details makes this flow very nicely and makes it very approachable to non/new wargamers. The chits are awesome with great *artwork* depicting the actual unit instead of the typical flimsy bits with the all-to-common unit symbology that looks like learning a foreign language to newcomers.

Gets half a point more than AtB due to the superior rules, components, and scenarios.

I'm a fan of the CAP system as a way to encourage holding onto a reserve.  I also appreciate the lack of leaders, which is a tactical trope that I think needs to go the way of the dodo.  The components are of course lovely, though the counter set with the first edition leaves something to be desired.  My big issue with the system--and the updated rules don't really address this--is the tendency to see the combat devolve into something that looks more like aerial dogfighting than anything else, as you go back and forth with individual units so you don't waste any remaining APs if at all possible.  I'm also not a huge fan of the scenario design, which generally creates tension by keeping the turn limits unreasonably short.  I like the system more than some others, but I think it's been thoroughly eclipsed by Band of Brothers.

Stellar production values.  Corrected a lot of the niggling annoyances with AtB to make a great game even better.  Tweaked rules for better flexibility and better historical accuracy.

I was about to give up on wargames altogether, but it seems that third time is a charm!  Over the past couple of years I purchased, played, and traded away 2 entry-level wargames, and was beginning to think that they simply weren't my cup of tea.  But I decided to give it one final shot with this game, and I'm very glad I did!  Now, my rating of this game is very premature since I've only played the first firefight with the most basic, "section 1" rules, but it has sufficiently captured my interest that I'm very much looking forward to learning the rest of the system (and readjusting my rating as I do so).  The designer has done a fantastic job with simulating many elements of squad-level warfare using the simplest of rules - it's quite an incredible system he has created!  And thankfully, unlike even the other entry-level wargames I've played, this game doesn't take hours to play through a scenario.  It moves along quickly and there is next to no downtime as the interaction between players is continuous.  The most basic rules leave the game feeling a little repetitive after a while since a lot of the game elements are not yet introduced, but I'm very excited to add more depth to the game, particularly in the form of hidden units and artillery bombardments!  The physical components are wonderful, with big, colourful counters containing easy-to-read symbolism.  I purchased my first pair of reading glasses as a direct result of the first wargame that I ever acquired, but with this game I only need them to read the unit names at the top of the counters.  So far, the only improvement I could find was with the Action Point allocation system.  Instead of 7 points per activated unit, we rolled 3 dice under a cup, kept the highest and lowest roll hidden under the cup, and removed the middle die, revealing that one to the opponent.  Then when we had finished that unit's activation, we lifted the cup to reveal the dice.  Yes, this system adds a bit of the "luck of the die" element, however the tradeoff is the tense, "fog of war" aspect of not knowing how long the enemy will be able to remain active.  All in all, a fantastic game that has my hooked and eager to dive into it some more (and I fully expect my rating to increase as I do so)!  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7.5/10

Exceptionally elegant for a wargame. Rules are unusually easy to grasp, especially for the first 'firefight', but still properly extensible & simmy.

I've only played this solo in my pc (via zun tsu - check academy games site for more info)

This game is the gold standard of war games. The mechanics are phenomenal while not perfect, (no game is) its one of the the best war games of its kind I have played.
Truly a must have for wargamers.

Very good production value, top quality components and interesting mecanism that simplify a lot what ASL does. However limited replay value, not so many scenarios, haven't played it again that much

It's Just an Awakening-type game. I think it's the definitive Squad Level gateway game. So much better than Combat Commander.

I was very impressed with this game. The action point system is very fun and ingenious. Also this game is a prime example of good usability. Tables and chits are work of art (usability wise). This may be the first WW2 game where I don't think about rules while playing. I only think about tactics.

Traded.  I really liked it.  Rules are seemingly complex at first but repeated plays helps tremendously.  This was the reason I traded it away.  I could not play it often enough to get the more advanced rules down.  Every time it got played it was almost like the first time.  It was hard to find enough people who were interested in playing and had the desire to learn it.  If I have a friend who is interested in playing on a regular basis I would not hesitate to buy it again.

I love the new activation rules for Storms of Steel. The play moves very smoothly and there's never a dull moment. This is a great refinement of the original system and the scenarios I've played so far have been exciting and challenging. This is the best tactical game I've played in terms of involvement, excitement, and historical feel.

This is the first "new" wargame I have played in years and it is quite simply fantastic. Straight forward common sense rules without the extraneous BS that ASL offers (having said that, I still like ASL). The large format components are superb - easily the best I've seen in a hex and counter wargame and the boards look great. 

I am really loving this game at the moment - if only I could convince my wife to give it a go...

Played the first two missions which were extremely one-sided. Granted both players were very inexperienced so we'll have to try it again with some better planning. Very enjoyable.

Very decent light tactical wargame, with an excellent activation mechanic and zero downtime. A bit too luck based tho, as with most 2d6 based systems.

I played a four player game with tanks. I think I would like this game much more with two players and infantry. I will have a better idea if I play under those conditions. Too hard to judge this one based on the scenario and number of players but I think this one will get better the more it is played.

I really like the flexibility of the game. My favorite part so far is picking the random counter to determine what a hit does. Some of the firefights seem a bit unbalanced, but they actually usually turn out to be pretty damn close.

After one introductory play, this game soared to my top 10. I love the tactics and the mechanics, but I feel like the theme of the game sits on top of the mechanics, not the other way around. I'm looking forward to the expansions!

Great improvement over the original ("Fury of the Bear") in terms of turn structure. Plays fast, scenario quality decent.

Sept 2011: goes up to a 10 after another set of plays. Definitely one of the best games I own. - 

Lowered to a 8.5 after another set of plays (also of the Poland expansion) - only time and more sessions will tell if the system can bear the weight of its promise.

Needs to be in the game design Hall-of-Fame.  There really ought to be one.  Beautiful to look at, incredibly fun to play.  Production values are so high your jaw begins to ache as you play the game in slack-jawed wonder.  

Love that the game instructions hold your hand along the way.  Early scenarios gently coax you onward until you desire more complex, immersive gameplay.  If so, read the next couple of instructional pages.  Storms of Steel corrects some of the errors from the Awakening the Bear instructional booklet, the first in the Conflict of Heroes series.  

The expansions and support you receive from both the designer and publisher are among the best in the industry.  A must-get game whether or not you are a wargame fan.  :)

Got it after playing ATB first. I treat it more as an expansion of the first game rather than a stand-alone. Great improvement in quality of the making and historical background for scenarios. Some solitaire gameplay included. Some new elements like planes, sniper units, overlays for maps and veteran cards. LOVE IT!

I didn't like Awakening the Bear because the rules were somewhat hard to implement and I didn't like how the action point model worked.  I traded it away.

This game seems to fix both those problems.  The rules are much smoother and the interleaved actions work much better.  I picked up this and Price of Honour, also.

My 10-year-old likes playing around with (rather than playing) it.

Of the series I certainly prefer the rules to this one, but the scenarios tend to be too big & too 'busy' right from the start, excepting the ones that are all-infantry or al-tank! No smaller mixed-force scenarios. Awakening the Bear tends to be better for scenarios, but there are generally too few in any case!

However, a damn fine game.

My first real wargame. Enjoyable squad-based combat. I really like how the mechanics are used and it flows very well during gameplay. We didn't have too many issues, mostly just used the rules to reference modifiers. The hit chits work well to randomize squad penalties and it's cool how they go back into the pool after. I also liked how most units have decent range so you're firing more often instead of just moving into position (ie M44). Looking forward to using some vehicles since we only played infantry based scenarios, although I like the small infantry skirmishes. From the looks of things, the vehicle scenarios are huge and likely are too complicated for me.

There is a solo module coming out at some point that I plan to look into.

My background in tactical wargaming is close to the beer and pretzel end with things like Warhammer Fantasy and Warmachine... so the relative lightness of the rules here combined with the depth of play is right up my alley.  The back and forth nature of unit activation works great and presents new tactical challenges and reaction opportunities... particularly since I'm so used to "I go, you go" gameplay for this kind of game.

I doubt I'll get to play all that often, but I will certainly be looking for opportunities to get this to the table whenever I can!

Ostatnio moja ulubiona gra wojenna. Nie mam za dużego doświadczenia w wargamerach ale uważam że seria CoH świetnie nadaje się na rozpoczęcie zabawy z tego rodzaju grami.

02/2011 Only played one scenario so far. Our game rotation only allows me 1 game every fortnight so after AtB we moved to Combat Commander for a change. After that we'll move to SoS.

First edition is now for trade/sale

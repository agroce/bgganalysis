Solid tactical space-combat game. Very much On the lighter side of things, I really like the 'tactics deck' aspect of the game that keeps things interesting. Game seems to have strong 'narrative power' ; I feel like the game tells a story as you play.

Played a few times, but I have a hard time finding people to play with. Never played with the loaded ship rule. Haven't given this game a fair shake yet.

RATING: 5
Nice miniatures hide an all too average game. It's certainly better than its namesake, but still just doesn't offer up much excitement. I'd wager those who like a light-weight space battle game will find this adequate. But for me, I need something a bit more frenetic to keep me interested. It plods along.

RATING: 9.5
Played solo to give it a try. I really hate Hasbro now. This game has so much potential, but they released it unfinished, and have left it to wither on the vine. This could have been a great franchise with proper support.

They took a ho-hum game like battleship and turned it into something special. THIS is the way all battleship games should be designed.

One board has a minor imperfection in the center, and all of the corners of the box are dinged up - one of them has a roughly 2" split.

This game was a lot of fun, but it didn't quite manage to scratch that "epic space battle" feel I was looking for. The main flaw with it was the number of copied cards and the lack of unique ones. Other than that, it was hard to find someone willing to play it with. When they heard "Battleship" they would be appalled at the level of complexity it turned out to have. Unfortunate.

While there certainly better and or better fleshed out skirmish games out there.

Admittedly, I didn't dislike Battleship Galaxies.  The problem laid with the fact that the game basically needs expansions, and it doesn't seem like Hasbro is on top of providing that.  There's just too much untapped potential here (along with too few ways I want to play my cards).

Initial Impressions: This is the game that got me back into boardgaming. It's a great tactical game with asymmetrical sides and lots of variability with the initial fleet setup. The components are very well produced and the game looks as good as it plays. Although the base game is complete and provides hours of fun, expansions would always be welcome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Although "Wretcheridians" is just embarrassing as a name, the game itself is quite fun. Definitely a different feel to the two sides, both in ships and in actions. Liked the ability to chain actions (set up one with another, whether immediately or later). Looks like a lot of thought went into balance, and it plays well so far.

Finally gave in threw my want list out the window and placed the green on this one! I am excited and am looking forward to it, time permitting I will get to play this one soon.

Rating based on 1 half-play. The cards were more complexly written then I was expecting. I guess I wanted Heroscape/Summoner Wars sensibilities, but, you know, in space. The energy cost to activate and add ships, and play cards is well done. Just didn't excite me as I thought it was going to. Ill give it another try.

RATING: 4
Very light on and fell very flat with our group. The components are very nice, but the game itself doesn't feel like a spaceship game. Feels like the mechanics could have been rethemed and been just as much a sci-fi skirmish or fantasy skirmish game.
There are few strategic choices to be made and those are usually fairly obvious to make.
There is no maneuvering or fire arcs or anything really to encourage any other tactic than moving towards the enemy and hoping you roll better than they do. Cards add some interest, but overall was very dissappointed with this one.
Maybe more tactical options will arise with more ships, but right now, not something we'll play very often.
Really wanted to love it...

RATING: 7
Two plays. It feels a bit Heroscape and a bit Mag•Blast—both very good things. (I'm even kinda surprised it wasn't called "Hersocape: Galaxies!") 

Game play is pretty clean and the various ship types, their weapons and powers, and tactics cards move the game away from the tired sea-battle-in-space genre of most space combat games and into more of an engaging and fresh space-battle-in-an-anime realm. You have heroes and villains, special super-weapons and defences, and all sorts of odd little ships and fighters swirling around the main heavies.

It looks like that expansion packs may be just over the horizon, provided the game sells in the appropriate numbers. If not, I'll bet enterprising fans will come up with suitable decks for their favorite franchises and factions. Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5...all could be fodder for fan mods if this game gets anything like a following!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Only played one time but I've watched a couple of games also. The game is very strategic and the further one goes into the scenarios the better the game is. I like all of the different abilities of the ships and the factions and then you can play attachments and events to make things even better. The game is very different every time, even playing the same scenario. I think there is a lot of potential for this game to go from good to great with fan-made scenarios and expansions to give it a little more weight. Really looking forward to more plays.

RATING: 5.5
A pretty basic spaceship combat game. Movement is just like ground-pounders on a hex map, and facing isn't tracked. The command card decks do make things interesting, providing tactical bonuses for critical actions.

This is clearly written with an eye on expansion. Unfortunately, it doesn't sound like we're going to see anything official on that front.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A game with really cool spaceship miniatures that winds up being a very boring slog of a game.  The rules encourage players to move ships to within firing range and then roll until someone wins.  

The components could be used to make a good game.  But it's not worth buying for the game that comes in the box.

RATING: 7.5
So many good ideas here, but it wound up taking forever to get through a game. Some cool ship designs, but not quite enough variety, and the game was eventually dead-ended without any expansions. The comic was a little dorky, the ship-hit resolution a little clunky, the scenarios not quite differentiated enough. This hurts, in particular, because it looked like it could have been the holy grail of a mass-market, hex-based space combat game.

These days, we have X-Wing for fighter combat and a few options for fleet combat, but still none that quite nails the sweet spot that this game promised.

A good game.  Can feel like you're being done in by luck, but there enough dice rolls throughout the game to make this a moot point.

There are a lot of things to like about this game - battles are relatively quick and bloody - which is important given the weight of the rules.

I like the card mechanism, they allow a player to customise their fleet a little differently every game.

The game doesn't last too long - which is a good thing - all in a fun game that is extremely well produced.

I love the comic - absolutely one of the best things about the game - really helps to set the scene and build the 'world' of the game - brilliant addition.

Lived up to, even surpassed, my expectations.

Fantastic components, and the rulebook is a joy to read.  Easy to teach, which is key for me.

Edit: I've added damage coordinates to the ship cards.  On a test play, it made very little difference, except to elicit whoops of laughter and cheering the one time a ship's systems were disabled - just before it was destroyed.  That's all I really wanted - increase the fun factor.

Next up: rules for asteroid movement and a custom "orbiting" board for battles in the upper atmosphere!

RATING: 8.5
This is quite an interesting game that bares little to no resemblance to the classic Battleship game.  The game plays like a table-top game, but it's simple enough for casual gamers to quickly pick up.  The models are extremely well-made, with their own stands, and the board is of high quality and detail.

The gameplay is fun, and very exciting as you engage in epic standoff battles in the galaxy.  Every ship has unique abilities, weapon, and move ranges and they all feel and play differently.  The company has upped this even further by giving 3 versions of each ship to choose from. Rolling to see if you hit is a great mechanic as well, and the hit grid varies from ship to ship, making for some exciting hits and misses.

I love playing this game, but I'm anxious to see if there will be expansions that flesh out new race options to increase replay value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An interesting Heroscape replacement... I like the system well enough and the ships and their abilities are interesting enough to give the two sides a different feel. However I found the early game much more interesting than the endgame. Early on there was a bit of manouvering, positioning and card play. But towards the end of the game it became a bit of a standup slug fest as both sides took turns rolling attacks to see who could finish the other off. And as this "miss, miss, hit" continued back and forth time just dragged on far too long for what the game is. This was, however, the intro scenario which is a fight until one side is eliminated kind of affair which I generally dislike as a scenario seup. I'm interested to play out some of the other scenarios to see what they're like. The production values of the game are quite good and I hope Hasbro/WotC support it so it can grow into something more. Based on 1 play.

There are certainly some things I love about this game but overall there is something lacking. Also, the selection and customization of your fleet is a bit fiddly and increases the playtime as well. Perhaps this game will improve with expansions, but I'm not sure if I'll bother expanding it. I have other games of this style that I love more so it's hard to imagine playing this enough to justify an expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A medium-complexity space game that hits a lot of the right spots for me. And the use of hidden info on the cards is what shoots this way beyond the old 80's style space games like SFB.

The two fleets are differentiated somewhat according to the ships themselves. Humans are defensive, predictable, and have tough hulls. The buggy aliens have strong shields and cheap activation and lots more unexpected tricks in their deck of cards. 

Also I think that the scenarios look great, kudos to the design team at HasBorg.

One quirk is that it seems as if there is a bit too much territory control for a vacuum; you are penalized for moving adjacent to an enemy vessel. On the one hand this makes it possible to screen capital ships, but on the other it reduces the feeling of being in the void of outer space.

[b][FirstPlayOn27thDec2011][/b] Very cool game. The way the damage is inflicted to the ship is interesting. Each craft has their respective card reference and the image of the craft is laid on a grid. To check for hits, you simply pin point the x and y-axis after you roll the d10 and d8 dice. Also every space ship has one or two critical hit spots (depending on the craft size), which means, if your opponent hit this mark, your craft instantly blown.

On every turn, each player has energy (just like action points) that they can spend on.

The sculptures are excellent and comes pre-painted. It's a fair price for what you get in the box.

A fantastic, first rate production from Hasbro.  I really liked the inclusion of the comic book to give more sotry background than the typical one paragraph write up in the rule book.  You can tell that this game is the spiritual descendant of Heroscape.  I guess that means that there are many more expansions to come.  The game is definitely aimed as a simpler, mass-market kind of game. The game play is clean a smooth.  It uses energy as a multi-functional resource.  I like the card play aspects.  I am a bit concerned about the static nature of combat.  Without face rules or terrain, it seems that all you do is maneuver into position and start trying to beat the snot out of each other.  Time will tell if there is more subtle tactical depth here.

It's got gorgeous bits and accessible space battling gameplay.  I wish for a little more in terms of complexity (firing arcs, facings, blocking, etc.)  It might come in an expansion.  The 6 rating is for the decent battling system and the cool cardplay, along with the fantastic bits.

If this gets an expansion, it might hit the big time.  As is, it's kinda "OK."

There's been a lot written about this one in the last 30 days, so I don't know if I really have anything more to add. It's [i]not quite[/i] HeroScape in space; it's better than just [thing=2425][/thing] in space; there's more to it than just cool toy spaceships.

We did have some minor problems with the rules. The rules are simple and easy enough, but in some places they seemed to sacrifice clarity for simplicity. I understand wanting to encourage people to just jump right in, but rules need to be explicit. For example, there are card enhancements to ships that can only be played during the deployment phase. Does that mean they can only be played [i]on a ship while it is being deployed,[/i] or could it be played on [i]any[/i] ship, just only during the deployment phase? The former makes sense logically, but there's nothing in the rules saying you can't do the latter.

In the end, I think it is a really good game, but probably just not for me. I would like to give it a few more tries, but I'm not sure how likely that is to happen.

RATING: 2.5
I played it once and quit out of extreme boredom after one and a half hour, with only one or two ships destroyed on each side. I had high hopes for this game, but, sadly, it is terrible. Basically, move your ships into attack position and roll dice for the rest of the game, playing some cards along the way. Since the ships can move and fire through other ships, friendly and enemy alike, there is almost no need for tactical maneuvers and no room for clever play. And it's quite annoying to keep checking rows and columns for hits. Besides, I have a huge dislike for having to keep track of lots of special powers - especially when, in order to play effectively, I also have to know the opponent's powers and they are impossible to read across the table. The Sci-Fi theme and the painted miniatures are the only good things in the game.

RATING: 7
I really like this game. My initial rating is based off of only a couple plays, but it was fun. My rating will likely go higher if/when expansions come out for the base set. The base set is great, but there is definitely more that should come out to add more variety, depth and options. One of the cool things about this game is that it is very customizable for people that are so inclined. So you can easily make up new scenarios and/or come up with some variant rules to add the level of depth that you want. The level of complexity people can add is up to them, or people can just have fun playing the game as it is. 

If people are into the tournament scene, this game can be played in tournaments. 

Ultimately I think that people can get whatever they want out of the game, depending on what they want to put into it. You can enjoy it as it is, enjoy tourney play, or enjoy adding variant rules to it to gain the level of complexity and game length you desire.

The rules are easy enough. But there is a lot of text on the cards. This will require several plays to master.

RATING: 6
Seeing this one rated so low might be surprising since it seems to check all the boxes for the kinds of games I like, but it just didn't work for me. Granted, I haven't played it a ton of times, but that's out of lack of desire, not lack of opportunity.

The pieces look amazing, let's get that out of the way. They seem sturdy to me, and they look so good on the table. The board even adds to this with its star field design. The card illustrations have a comic-book style to them, which may be a positive or a negative for some people, but I think it works well here.

Any time you have asymmetrical sides, there are two things that need to be there for the game to work. Firstly, the sides should be balanced. That is, given players of comparable skill, the win ratio should be close to even. Secondly, and more importantly, the sides need to feel different in terms of how they play. Unfortunately, I think Battleship Galaxies fails at both of these.

Out of the box, the Wretcheridians (bad guys) seem to simply have better ships in terms of stats. They also have some very nasty cards. The good guys' ships seem weaker in general, but their cards are also much more situational. It is very easy to get stuck with a hand of cards that don't help in any way. Now I say "out of the box" because this is a somewhat customizable game. However, I'm generally not interested in sitting around coming up with the best army/deck/whatever. Even with Heroscape, we generally draft or use premade armies when we play. I can't fault the game for having the option for players to customize, but it shouldn't be necessary to enjoy the game. Others with a lot more games of BG played may take issue with this point, and I'll concede it's possible we just missed something of the strategy. I could forgive this if not for the second point:

The sides simply don't feel different enough. A point or two change in movement value doesn't make one team feel "more mobile." Nothing about the tactics of the Wretcheridians seems evil or underhanded. The only theme the game provides is in the included comic book, card illustrations, and sculpts. The actual narrative of the game doesn't tell a story because it feels like two similar (albeit unbalanced) sides just attacking each other. 

Mechanically, movement rarely matters because of the range of ships. The special abilities seem unnecessarily complicated for the simplicity of the system. And I generally found my hand filled with useless cards. As discussed above, I don't think "well then customize your own deck" is a fair response to this.

All that said, the game does have some good things to offer beyond just eye candy. I know it probably sounds like I hate this game but that isn't true. It's simply that because it is such a highly anticipated game, I feel the need to explain my reasoning. The action point system is done very well here and makes you debate, sometimes agonizingly, over how to spend your limited-yet-constantly-refilling action point pool. The dice rolling works very well, allowing smaller ships to be harder to hit which is very thematic. There is great potential in the system for expansions, I just hope they do it in such a way as to create a balanced and fun experience right out of the box. I would absolutely give this one a second look based on how the expansions turn out.

Great base set which brings fleet battles to life without too many fiddly rules. I love Star fleet battles but it's a rules nightmare. This is a breeze.

It does NEED expansions to be truly great though. Let's hope it happens.

Some fiddly components and a bit too many options to start off with what should otherwise be a straightforward game. In turn, this bogs down gameplay a bit. That being said, this is rather fun and has a unique dice combat mechanism that harkens back to the ol' Battleship days while simultaneously bringing something new to the show (at least, I guess, when it came out five years ago). Thankfully that's the only reference to its ancestor, because I'd rather wipe those childhood memories.

I really wish Hasbro hadn't mothballed this project fresh out of the stardock--but still, it's a worthwhile tactical space combat game (with a few fun yet questionable nods to its classic namesake).

The components are great, the mechanics are certainly fresh and full of possibilities--but as has been said by almost everyone, it needs some expansion to fully flesh out the ideas that have been introduced. Deckbuilding is particularly unfulfilling, since choices are rather limited (or, as in the case of the squad equipment upgrades, non-existent).

The designers have hinted that there were some concepts on the drawing board (such as 8 different factions) that got left behind; it'd be great if one day those ideas were shared with the let-down BSG community, and then perhaps those interested in fleshing out the strong bones here could get to work. Until then, they'll always be a tinge of disappointment after the fun of playing this one.

Played the first scenario while learning the rules. It's a neat mechanic twist, best described as "let's play battleship, but the battleships move around, they have shields, and you can upgrade the battleship weapons!". So, it's like Battleship, but really not like Battleship at all :)

i liked the 2 player version, but i think the 4 player scenarios would play better (based on initial play).

Too shallow for me.  I felt the game was too parsimonious with the energy points - starving the players is not the same as forcing tough choices.  It would also have benefited from more rules - too much was left on the table to promote simplicity and the game suffered in comparison to other fare.

As for balance, I found the pirates rather powerful (thanks to the invulnerability save on their capital ship), though I didn't spend an enormous amount of time looking for a solution since the game rapidly moved off my table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Poor component quantity. Box design looks like parts are intended to be assembled / disassembled, but ship supports easily snap. 

More broadly, I'm not convinced there's any strategic balance to the game. It's high on theme and dice rolling, but very low on tactical ability. (The 1-in-80 chance that your ship simply dies, regardless of remaining hit points, when it has no shields is exceptionally scary, given that not having shields is more or less unavoidable.)

It's probably better with 2 players than 4, and perhaps much better with a bunch of rules clarifications. But even with major adjustments, it feels very high on flavor and low on tactical decisions / balance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Looking pretty good so far. Very well-designed light starship combat game. I'm a little curious, though, why Heroscape (by the same designer and publisher), a game aimed at a general audience, had advanced rules, but Battleship Galaxies, aimed squarely (we're told) at the hobby market, doesn't. Granted, some could be retrofitted on, but it seems a bit of a missed opportunity to build capacity for such rules in.

A very weird game to rate. The basic game is very simple, clean and easy to play. However when the Tactic cards come into play, the game becomes very troublesome to keep track off. The game does turn into a bit of a slugfest, luckier rolls usually winning the day.

I also tried a BGG variant with firing arcs and turning circles, its a great variant, adds a lot more to the game.

A game of space combat. This game has a lot going for it; awesome components & presentation, clear & streamlined rules, and reasonable playing time. I like it to an extent but there are just enough things that bother me that playing it makes me want to find and play another space combat game instead. 

Most importantly I don't like that ships can move in any direction each turn (no account for momentum) and I don't like that all ships can fire in all directions (no account for firing arcs). With these two factors, maneuvering is significantly less interesting (or even necessary) than it could be. The other thing it has against it is the way damage is handled by rolling a letter & number die and looking up hits on a grid. It is a nice tie-in to the battleship name but it quickly feels tedious especially considering the same results could have been achieved with a die roll compared to a chance to hit.

Now this game is chocked full of goodness. Awesome components, great theme, add in fast and bruttle game play and you have yourself a winner WOTC! I have only played the first mission so far, but right out of the gate I can tell that the game offers a lot of tactical choices with only a small amount of the design spaces explored. Expansions will definitely be a must, but what is in the base game will deifnitely have you playing for a few years all by itself. Sounds like another sandbox game win for the team who brought you Heroscape.

[u]Comments Update:[/u]
Seeing as how this didn't sell too well it doesn't seem likely that WOTC will be releasing any expansions, which is a damn shame. This game was a fine example of space combat. Intuitive, and immediately accessible by hobbyists and gentiles alike. Great miniatures and solid play offered a solid base game that could have lead to so much more. Oh well, after not getting it to the table for more than a year I decided to trade it away so that someone else can enjoy this box of awesomeness, but I may change my mind down the road and get it back at some point.

After hearing about the project, I wasn't really impressed. A handful of minis and a kinda stupid, Battleship license-forced battle system... But because of the designers, I was sure that after two or three expansions it will be a decent game. It took only one actual play to convert us to avid fans. The whole combat side of the game is a low-fuss, intense fun, and the battle system makes complete sense, doesn't feel gimicky at all. Despite the relatively low number of actual models there are multiple variants of each ship/squadron giving a whole lot of options choosing your forces, and on top of that, the tactic deck preparation adds another layer of fun. Here's hoping for dozens of expansions, but despite the expectations, the base game alone will be sufficient enough for quite a while.

Ended up being a bit too light for my tastes. Not much point to maneuvering as position factors in little to none. Most games devolve into moving into range with your preferred mix of ships and standing toe to toe and slugging it out. 

Great minis though!

RATING: 7
After getting this to the table, I can see the concerns others have shared. Firstly, this is not a negative opinion: this game is fantastic. The components are fantastic (the comic is a very nice touch), and the gameplay is surprisingly strategic and exciting. However, as Tom Vasel and the guys at Penny Arcade have mentioned, this game desperately needs more. More ships, more cards, more environmental components, more factions- just, more. Battleship Galaxies screams of potential, and I have joined the many who crave a much needed expansion. The four player mode also needs some work, as it feels tacked on, rather than fleshed out. 

I also believe that the Wretch (seriously, just drop the full name, the Wretch sounds much more awesome) are quite overpowered. Keep in mind this is just first impressions, as I've only played one game so far. In the interests of full disclosure, I got my ass handed to me as the ISN. With a more balanced Wretch, I *still* would have been beaten, as his strategy was far superior to my own. However, I felt a degree of helplessness very early into the game; much earlier than I would have expected. The cards I received did not appear to help me anywhere near as much as my opponents', and ultimately I felt significantly disadvantaged. I'm not a competitive person and the outcome of a game is not a concern to me, however the feeling of helplessness left a (very slight) sour taste in my mouth. 

Regardless, I believe Hasbro are on a winner here: simply a winner that needs an expansion (or expansions) that both add more and balance out the factions somewhat.

Got a chance to play this at Origins 2011, and had a fun time!  Physical components are very nice, Ship great, cards interesting and decent counters etc.  Two distinct sides with interesting ships, a bit more strategy evident then one would expect from a Hasbro game.  With more plays I think I would rate this a 9.  Very conducive to expansions.  Even came with a comic to set the theme, so it gets a full rating point for that!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I have desperately wanted to play this game for months and finally got the chance. Now that I've gotten the chance... not sure what to rate it. I'm going with a 7 for now but reserve the right to change it after more plays.

I had never played it before and had no idea what each side's strengths and weaknesses were and didn't know what to expect. I played as the humans and my opponent was the red guys (whatever they are called). At first, it seemed like the game was massively balanced against the humans. That is because his three measly fighters seemed to be flying circles around my ENTIRE fleet and had them on the defensive. It took a nuke and lots of attacks before I finally managed to destroy them. Then as soon as I did, my opponent had cards that allowed them all to respawn!

I was getting severely frustrated since it seemed nothing I did mattered and I was being thwarted at every turn. Then I finally killed the darn things off for good... and then it seemed easy for me. I just pummeled the crap out of his remaining ships while absorbing tons of damage. All I lost was the one ship the enemy fighters went after. 

I had expressed my frustration with the game in the early phases when it seemed I was over matched, but did mention that I would keep an open mind until the game was over. I ultimately won when it seemed like I was going to get slaughtered. Perhaps the red team just has really good fighters and crappy capital ships. The humans seemed weak in comparison but once I punched through the enemy shields they were rather weak. 

I think this is one of those games that you just have to play a bunch in order to familiarize yourself with the characteristics of all the ships. Once that has occurred, you will get more enjoyment out of it. I suspect my rating will go up if I play this more and start to gain this understanding. I hope so.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Wait - this is a Hasborg game? It has interesting mechanics, tactical nuances, asymmetry... and it was deeply fun to play. I am a little nervous about balance issues since the Wretch seemed able to completely mow down and destroy the humans almost without contest. Looking forward to future games.

A very good light space battle game that is much better than the Battleship name and except for the pegs used to signify the remaining strength of your ship shields, bears no other resemblance to the classic game.  Had it not carried that title it would have sold many more copies.

An excellent space dual. lot's of options and viable strategies to be used. We played several 2v2 games and it was light years ahead of other games of this type we had tried. Battleships strips away all of the usual mind numbing micro details of most space games and leaves you with a very playable, fun, easy to get into game.

This is to starship combat what Heroscape is to land combat. Not a broken game, but nothing outstanding. Does a good job of omitting elements with low return-on-fiddliness (facing, line of sight, range modifiers, etc.).

Battleship Galaxies is an excellent, elegant game.  It's a fairly light game, but has depth hardwired into the design.  Every turn a player gets a base of 10 energy to spend on playing cards, bringing ships onto the battlefield, and activating ships to move & attack.  You never have enough energy to do everything you want each turn.  Each ship has a stat card that shows its costs and capabilities as well as a grid map that is used to determine any hits rolled by the opponent. This is Hasbro's new Heroscape in that the game is more of a system in which we'll see a lot of expansions.

Great components and simple rules make this a strong contender for a quick two player miniature space battle game that will hit the table several times.  The high degree of randomness and a few overpowered weapons detract a little from the tactical portion, but all in all a solid game.  Plus most of the components can be re-implemented for use in other, less component heavy space games like Hard Vacuum, for example.

Basic skirmish, i.e. rather uninteresting gameplaywise, but there are some nice special powers and combos, and the ship miniatures are great. Heavily relies on the quality of scenarios available.

Battleship Galaxies is one of those games that you will get the most out of if you play it, using both factions, time and again. A one-off play here and there is a confusing way to approach it, as reading small text from across the table and constantly evaluating and reevaluating your hand are not fun. 

So I get this game, very well-designed--but I think I'd almost always rather play X-Wing. It does not help that there are no expansions.

RATING: 6
Get energy, use it to launch ships, use it to move ships, use it to have your ships fire on and kill opponent's ships until they're all dead. It's pretty straight-forward. Throw in a deck of special power tactics cards to boost your ships as another energy suck. The problem is it's such a plain board, so it seems too abstract, disguised by the miniatures and the combat dice resolution - which is the only throwback to Battleships. Roll a letter based d10 and a number based d10 - if the co-ordinate is a hit on the target ship (based on the diagram on the ship card), then the ships sucks up hits equal to your ship's weapon strength. If hits exceed shields + hull, death. Move, shoot. Move, shoot. Move, shoot. Roll well. That sums it up. It needed more.

RATING: 7.5
Cool Heroscape like game, but with ships. I can see how the limited amount of stuff in the base game (which is a lot, but feels like it is just the tip of the iceberg) means expansions might be coming. Rules are not too complex, but you have to know your enemy or else risk bad issues. Some rules need some extra research to understand.

The storage for this game is well designed, and the game itself is not too bad, but could have been improved. 
Overall, I would have loved to get expansions for this game, if they had ever been made. Without expansions, the game just feels like it's lacking something, and the design begs expansions.

RATING: 7
I like the throwback to battleship. It's basically heroscape in space which is always cool. I think the game would benefit from some expansions, which you can tell they anticipated. Interesting powers, and I like the way you can make your ships better or worse for points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game is very, very good. It is a slimmed down version of Star Fleet Battles. Very accessible. The systems allow for quick play while permitting the players multiple choices. Where Heroscape brought miniatures play to the masses, this brings space miniatures to the masses. The game feels more cohesive than Heroscape with it's screwy mix of armies. The cards add to the game without introducing radical randomness. 

The senarios are repayable as there are so many ways each game can develop. It seems obvious that there will/should be expansions. I could see the system employed with a Star Wars or Star Trek theme. If they avoid the introduction of silly expansions (demon fleets, space monsters, etc.) this could become the defacto standard.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Nice game to play with your kids. Dice can have a massive influence on the outcome so take it for the fun romp it is supposed to be. Tactic cards are neat but limited in their scope. 

I will say for the money it is very good value. An improvement on boring classic battleship that makes the game interesting at least. Plus even if you don't like the game as much, the production value is top notch. The minis in this are outstanding and look great and are made of a nice soft rubbery plastic which means they won't break all the time. Some thought was put into the quality of the components. Even the tray everything sits in is outstanding. Very happy to have to play with my 9 year old.

Very, very good here. It's a kind of Heroscape in the space!
To be honest, I was expecting something similar, because the authors are the same ones who developed some of my favorite games such as Star Wars Epic Duels, Heroscape and Summoner Wars.
Battleship Galaxies is so simple to learn but quite deep, strategic and tactic. There is lucky involved for sure, but I love this kind of games also for that. Overall, one word: AMUSING.

Game mechanics are well done (the old battleship to-hit system remand is a finesse!) and the mix-combo between ship abilities and cards is great; the possibility to play permanent card-attachments on the ships (like heroes, ship enhancements and additional weapons) gives to the player a good customization feeling for his fleet.
Very, very good components too: the ships are beautifully detailed and a marvel to see on their elevated stands on the board during a game, the artwork is good, there are two boards.. and I liked the idea of the comic in the box as a background story for the game. Really appreciated. High production value.

In my opinion there are some balance issues (Wretch are a bit too strong). A real pity, but something that can be handed (see my balance suggestions on the forums).

I hope for some kind of expansion - a new stand-alone set with two new factions and 4-players (team) rules and scenarios would be the absolutely best for me.


EDIT: in the end I bought a second copy of Battleship Galaxies to create a more complete game (mostly for 4 players), because I see that the game will not be supported with expansions... so bad.

RATING: 7
A very good game that conjures up memories of [i]Battlefleet Gothic[/i].  The one thing I don't like about it is that there tends to be no movement in the second half of the game and just instead repeated barrages of fire from the ships.  Probably realistic, but not much game.

I would like a second set of this in order to increase the fleet building options.

RATING: 6
I love the fleet/deck building choices at the start of the game, however I'd love to see more factions to pick from in the future. It still manages to feel like the old school Battleship game with the random hit locations decided by dice, but this is much better than any Battleship game I ever played.

Not quite  what I was expecting - I think so far for me the designer's previous efforts, in the form of Heroscape, are a more fun system.

However: it does have potential. The hidden army deployment is an interesting idea, and the cards are a nice way of adding strategy. Unfortunately, it needs a sizable expansion or two to realize this potential.

RATING: 7.5
Weighted nicely with a wide variety of options available to the player... but then starts to feel somewhat off balanced by the dice rolls used to resolve battles. Now, I'm certainly not against dice rolls used to resolve elements within a game, but I feel it has to be in correct proportion with the weight of the other aspects of the game. Here, the heaviness of the game's mechanics feels undercut by the dice rolls - so much preparing only to have the battles be determined by luck. One of the designers - Colby Dauch - found this perfect balance with [b]Summoner Wars[/b]... which this game resembles, interestingly enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I did find having to pay a deploy cost and activation cost interesting. There was rarely enough energy to do everything, so it did give the option for interesting choices. Rolling on the grid to hit was a little simplistic but it did create some excitement. My problem with the game is that it is too simple. Every weapon fires at a 360 arc, so facing does not matter. Other than big ships having less movement than small ships, all ships maneuver the same. This takes away nearly all tactical movement considerations. Once a range is reached, ships mostly just sit still and blast away at each other

A fantastic effort at a light strategic space battle game, with utterly gorgeous models, amazing narratives and enough meat.

This game is liquid potential.  I love tactical war games (especially when it has to do with spaceships, my weakness) and this one is light enough to not scare people off and not too light to where it doesn't feel like there is any strategy.  I really, really wish they would release expansions for this.

Bought into the hype from forums and video reviews...
Boy was I ever disappointed. The wife and I didn't even finish our first game. I don't know it just didn't click with us for some reason. I'll give it another shot before I completely write it off though...

This is surprisingly a good game.  It would have been better if they had left off the Battleship name as I think that turned away a lot of would be players from it.  More of a tactical space game and a much lighter version to Star Fleet Battles.  Movement similar to Leviathans. 
A shorter wargame that is fun to play and show newcomers to the world of tactical space movement games.
No tuen pulses like Star Fleet Battles, instead each player takes their turn in order.

Primera partida satisfactoria, a pesar de la derrota. Hay que aprender bien cuales son las diferentes ventajas de cada tipo de nave, así como lo que hace cada carta de evento, para poder sacarle el máximo partido a tu flota.

A nice offering from Hasbro. Strangely, it's somewhat in the mold of Heroscape, which I was sad to see Hasbro discontinue. Doesn't leave much hope for support and future expansions of this system. Not everything is great here, with several components disappointing me. The player screens are top-heavy and prone to tipping over, the peg used to mark energy levels simply rests in holes and tends to get knocked about (making keeping an accurate count almost impossible) and the plastic bases of the ships tend to slide around on the game board. That said, the minis are well-crafted and look great, and the game system is quick and fun rather than deep. The number and letter coordinate grid around each ship that determines hits and misses works well and is a nice homage to the original Battleship game without totally dumbing down the game. There's a lot to like here, especially if you've had a few beers or are playing with older kids.

What a wasted and missed opportunity from Hasbro/WotC...  This is such an amazingly fun Space Combat game, such a shame it has been put to bed without so much as a single expansion lullaby.

As it stands, even without any add-ons to expand its horizons, Battleship Galaxies is one helluva great game, dogfights happen often, grudge matches break out and flaming death greet you at every critical hit!

The rule sets are easy to learn and its strength lies in this simplicity as it doesn't waste time thrusting you into the melee.

Stay clear if you love your charts/tables/reference sheets because BG is about fast, tactical and often frenetic fun.

Space combat game that feels promising after my first play. Deployment and movement is intuitive, while still leaving room for tactical decisions. Clever point allocation (playing cards, deploying ships, activating squadrons, etc) is key, as there are never enough action points in a turn to do everything you want to do. Still, I would have preferred it if cards did not play such a big role in your succes. As it stands, they are just as important as anything you do on the board, and the prospect of deckbuilding (the cards seem to be made for it) is a little daunting. Simply put, there is more to read each turn than I care for in an action-packed miniatures game. Components are of great quality overall, even though the design of the spaceships is a little hit and miss with me. I also would have preferred to have painted ships instead of washed ones.

Just the right level of complexity for my wife and I.  The cards add a nice level of tactics as do the discovery tiles.  I like that you can transport ships with larger ships.  The artwork on the cards is great and the minis are really cool (though they were smaller than I had imagined).  I'm pleased with this game and look forward to the alluded to expansions.

Space fleet battles without a tome of rules that requires subheadings to the 3rd decimal place. 

I love the hidden fleet customization and that you are almost always in the game even when things look dire. There is a fair amount of luck from the dice but I think it is just the right amount, good play will usually trump luck.

The factions play differently and the production quality is fantastic. All of this results in a skirmish game that emphasizes fun over depth (i.e. I don't think it needs an "advanced" ruleset) and achieves that wonderfully. What surprised me the most about this title is its ability to generate an engrossing narrative.

Very high quality production (it's Hasbro after all) and an overall enjoyable gaming experience.

But it is far too light for my tastes, some advanced rules might have kept me interested enough to play it a 3rd time.

Battleship Galaxies is a space combat miniatures board game that is a distant cousin to the original Battleship game. The two opposing forces represented in the game, the human Intergalactic Space Navy and the alien Wretcheridians, are represented by 20 highly-detailed starship miniatures. There are figures for several different ship types and each has an individual reference card that defines the characteristics of that ship (e.g. weapons, movement, shields). The game is played on a star field hex board.

The game is scenario driven and each scenario will define the goal of the game as well as initial board set-up. Each turn, players have a certain number of energy points that can be spent to perform actions, such as movement or fire. Combat is resolved by rolling special dice, a ten-sided die with letters and an eight-sided die with numbers. The resulting letter-number combination is compared to the target ship’s reference card to determine the result. Hits on a ship are indicated by placing colored pegs in the figure’s base.

Wargaming in space with fantastic painted plastic space ships. You even get to call out "B5, is that a hit?". What's not to like?

The cards give a lot of possible variation in the strengths and weaknesses of each side and the board can be set up with different obstacles that can enhance some of these abilities.

We have been having fun with this game but to be honest I think I prefer Interstellar Mayhem a little bit more for blasting around in a spaceship shooting at other people!

Neat game.

Probably could've been higher if Hasbro had actually followed through with its expansion plans for it.  As it is, it sets up a bunch of systems that are never fully fleshed out with the contents of the base (and only) game.

The game over all is in good condition but it has 2 flaws, I evidently got it used from a smoker, and there is a cigarette burn in the rules. The rules are find-able online and the burn doesn't really effect the ability to read the rules much either.

So far, so good. It's very light, and if all you roll are misses, well, you are going to lose. Seriously needs more cards, more ships, etc., and they need them soon!

If there is an innermost ring in teen and pre-teen heaven, multiple copies of Battleship Galaxies will be prominently displayed and in constant use.

Don't be fooled by the space hype, however.  There are a lot of moving parts for what is essentially a dice chucking luck-o-rama, in which a win or loss can depend on one, two, or a dozen critical die rolls.  On the positive side, even for a gamer as jaded as I am, the "to-hit" grids and nested-ship surprise deployments are very cool.

Young kids, and even some teens, will be put off by the copious amounts of card and scenario text. Still, the full version (cards and all) is exactly the space jaunt that Star Wars children have been seeking ever since their geek parents introduced them to grumpy Wookies  and smart-mouthed Jedi Knights.  My guess, though, is that many adolescents and under-10s will be fully satisfied with ditching the cards, aiming their nicely detailed ships at their opponent(s), and setting free the space nukes.

Warning: As a fully-certified medium (in the supernatural sense), I foresee piles of broken spaceship stands in the future of many BG owners - especially those with kids eager to "help" put the game together.  I recommend a light touch - not a grabby 7-year-old - to snap the bases onto the ships.

I purchased 2 sets just to have the amazing minis. Gameplay was enjoyable, but in desperate need for expansions, a little more story and some terrain pieces like in the command and colors games and then it would be perfect. I forsee the ships getting repurposed into another space game soon :D

It's a good game.  The miniatures are really great, but the production quality of the game board is severely lacking; namely, the map-paper is so thin.  Why would they use such fragile paper to told together the cardstock of the boards?  It's already starting to tear.  

As for the gameplay, it's a lot of fun.  I enjoy the dice mechanic immensely, but I wouldn't mind if there were more cards in the game.

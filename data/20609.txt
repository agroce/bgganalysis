My favorite block game!  A wonderful take on the Pacific War.  It is a lot heavier than Avalon Hill's Victory in the Pacific, yet quite a bit easier than [thing=11825][/thing].

The obvious strategic warfare can be covered in a game like Columbia's Pacific Victory, but the chrome in this game is why it is so much better.  The pain of managing your supply network and oil resources as the Japanese are wonderful.  This game probably has my favorite repair/replacement system of any game on the market.

And while the game is strategical, the combat is more operational with the more granular level that it employs. Plus, when it comes to chrome, it's fun to have both the Chinese nationalists and communists in the same game working together and apart at the same time.

Asia Engulfed is a game I want to love, but I can't get past tolerating. Or maybe "like despite itself" is a more appropriate description.

Now for context: I played the game over two days with a buddy. It was my first game, and I think it was his second game against an opponent, third if you include some solitaire play he did.

I played the Allies. He played the Japanese.

So far so good.

Then the markers start appearing on the board. Garrisons. Transport network. Naval influence or dominance. LBAs (land-based air). We got lucky and didn't need Out of Supply markers, or new fortified position markers.

I hate the clutter on the board. To me, it is indicative of too many rules, and some don't even come into play all that much. Or would be better implemented via computer, or computer-assisted design (like Golem Arcana appears to be shooting for).

Another thing that rubbed me wrong is the strategic non-game component, which is mostly pointless die rolling and non-choices to execute. Mostly meaningless, and I feel they are there mostly so you can see the designers read a book or two about the topic. I'd rather they had read a book on design, or human psychology, or something that told them POINTLESS BUSYWORK SUCKS! Honestly, why bother with a developer if the game doesn't get developed?

Having said that, I do like the (somewhat complicated) naval combat system and the need to push, but just enough, as the American player. There's a neat bluffing component in the game that goes far beyond just having blocks in the game.

So, overall, while I didn't love the game, it wasn't (mostly) because of the game itself, but really the memory aspects of it and the record-keeping it requires. Asia Engulfed is a game that I'm willing to play on occasion (and maybe even more than Europe Engulfed), but I can't justify owning long term.

Initial Impression: Although this wonderful wargame is accessible to most wargamers, it's a middleweight game that takes a bit of getting used to. The blocks work wonderfully with this level of game, masking fleet strengths until engaged. Air cover rules make the even the smallest of islands potentially key to strategic plans. The game's pace is fairly true to historical events, requiring the US to wait, build up, and plan thier offensive. Supply, transport, and oil resource rules help to drive the Japanese objectives. I've got to play more of this game.

One of the better simulations of a hard to simulate war.  The blocks give some of the "searching for the enemy carriers" action that dominated the war.

Very interesting system and a great way to learn about this theatre.  Works well to integrate all the contrasting scales of the theatre in a fairly smooth way.  Takes too long to get to the table very often.  I would rate this higher if I was more interested in the Pacific Theatre.  For such a long game the naval battles are really variable and a few bad rolls can set you back almost a year of effort.  This is very realistic (just look at Midway) but you must approach this game as an experience and not a traditional game where the winner played better.

UPDATE: Comments that AE is a little process-heavy are probably accurate. It's strange, for instance, that you have to do all your naval moves, interceptions, and what-not, then put the game on hold and resolve all your production before you actually fight the battles. It makes sense, units committed to operations can't receive replacements and fleets need downtime to refit, and the effect feels right. But there's no denying that inserting production between movement and combat is a little jarring. Also, there is a little trickiness to re-basing. For me, it's all OK once you get the intent of the design (for me, Fire in the Sky is arguably more straightforward rules-wise, but harder to get your head around), but I can't argue with the folks who find the process cumbersome, or at least tricky.
---
UPDATE: After playing a bunch of AE now, I think it's not quite as totally compelling a game as EE. The game feels a little flabbier, with a fair number of turns in which not a lot happens - it's not the wall-to-wall action that EE is. It's also definitely swingy; throwing the carriers into battle is a roll of the dice, which is fine, but it argues for a shorter game; I think AE, like EE, is a touch long for comfort. Also it seems there is little incentive to split carrier forces as was done routinely historically; naval battles seem to be "all in" affairs. But that could just be me needing more experience with the system.

I do still like AE a lot though. The PTO is notoriously difficult to game, and even harder when you're trying to retain compatibility with an ETO game, and Jesse Evans has done as well as anyone could be expected to given the constraints. There are many fine touches here, from island groups not usually modeled in these games to the clever area breakdowns, the tough production choices for both sides, and the very successful use of the limited intelligence provided by the blocks. Of the recent PTO games, including Fire in the Sky and Empire of the Sun, this is easily the most compelling.

As always, if you're playing the campaign game, I do recommend starting in Jan '42. Also, the combined AE/EE game seems like it would have some issues, as the pace of the two games is pretty disparate. The AE players probably end up sitting around a fair amount.
---
Awesome. Feels a little more derivative than EE, with a fair amount of borrowing from other games like Victory in the Pacific and Fire in the Sky, but AE still retains a lot of the same great operational feel as EE while being a very successful PTO game in its own right. I enjoyed it quite a bit, felt it was very evocative, and look forward to giving it more play.

Still a little on the long side, though, I think. It's relative brevity was over-billed, I think; this is still an 8+ hour game for the whole war. Still, definitely more playable than EE, and *much* better player aids.

I was originally surprised that the designers of Europe Engulfed were trying to use the same system to design a game about the pacific theatre of WWII. I didn't think they would manage to create a very good game. I was very wrong! They managed to give you another great game full of difficult decisions, while retaining a very realistic feel I don't have room to go into all of the great rules they incorporated into this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Further play has revealed the following:

a) excellent depiction of the geography of the theater.  the use of port boxes, islands, and areas (each with its own basing and combat restrictions) does much to add depth to the geographic considerations a player must evaluate.

b) great (and realistic) use of fog of war.  Rick Young has commented that one of his gripes with Pacific Victory is that there is too much FOW.  (i.e. you should be able to at least tell an air unit from a naval unit).  He's right (although Pac Victory is still a great game).  AE strikes just the right balance in the FOW department.

c) Excellent depiction of the impact of American submarine power.

d) the game is (as another commentator here has noted) "process heavy". There is a very detailed sequence which must be followed.  Fortunately, the game comes with some outstanding player aids, including a Player Turn sequence chart.  The process is mildly intricate, but once you've done it a few times, it becomes second nature.

e) The game is (to my thinking, at least) more complicated than EE.  However, this is not surprising given that the Pacific is a much more complicated theater to depict.  The mix of land, naval, and air units added to the various geographic considerations almost mandates that the game will be more complicated than one covering Europe.

Overall, a very interesting game and one which requires the ability to think through many different considerations -- each of which has an effect on the others.

A worhty companion to EE, similar system but play differently. Significantly shorter (around 8 hours). It gives a good feel of the theater the hidden blocks work very well with the naval part of the system.

The political rules are simpler than EE but the aero-naval system and the supply rules are more complex, the rules add a lots of chrome which result in more complexity, be prepared to miss some important rules during your first games. But after that the game play rather fluently.

There are less operationnal decision to make than in EE the game is much more strategic, but at the same time you must pay attention to many small details. Fighting usualy involve only a few units on each side, there's nothing comparable to EE russian front. 

As you have very few WERPs to spend each turn the decision are all the more excruciating.

New naval rules (From Europe Engulfed) work quite well although it did feel like a lot was pinched from Fire In The Sky. I like it, but once a naval encounter happens, the block mechanism loses its effectiveness in modelling the issues of finding an enemy fleet. There's not quite enough on the board to easily hide where those carriers have gone.

Very interesting system that is unfortunately buried behind an opaque manual (why is supply the first section after the turn order when it doesn't come up until after naval movement?)
The system is quite a puzzle for the Japanese player who must deal with supply network, a dwindling oil reserve and very little WERPs to rebuild his army. The biggest challenge for the Allied player is bidding his time and waiting for any opening. After the 1942 turn however, the Allied must go on the offensive and should have all the resources to do so.
Intriguing and worth playing (and replaying). As difficult as the rules are, things will become clearer when you start pushing counters around.

Very nice PTO game that incorporates a very key aspect of the war - limited intelligence - with a very challenging economic game (particularly brutal for the Japanese). Also, incorporates China, which was woefully lacking in Fire in the Sky.

I would also say that this is the best PTO game I've played but there's no denying that the rulebook could do better work. Not so much that critical info was missing but rather it was hard to absorb some of the opaque rules.

I like it better than EE due to the lower block density and the very interesting naval mechanics (it's my first PTO game). I am not even sure whether it is really more complicated than EE. It adds the naval rules, but a lot of complicated EE stuff is gone: no weather, fewer ground unit types, fewer political rules, fewer special actions, less complicated sea-supply through fleet points. And I think the added naval/air rules are rather intuitive (and fun).
Some criticize it for being "procedural". Actually I cannot see how it is more "procedural" than any other wargame of this scope. As to the naval move phase happening before production, which some find strange: it's mainly a way to enable your fleets to secure supply through otherwise enemy-dominated sea zones, as they are at port at the beginning of the turn. Completely reasonable.

You get a lot of material in the box, including much better player aids than for EE. The production sheet is full of errors, though.
Rulebook is a bit cluttered.

Slow to the block game party, having misunderstood these games as poor at solo. Boy am I wrong... maybe I wasn't wrong, but I am now because of my failing memory. I can't for the life of me remember all the upright units after I switch sides.

Fascinating game, doesn't have any political elements of note, its all been abstracted out and absorbed within the movement/combat/production rules. The war in China is extremely simplified for gaming sake and for what it is trying to do, it works well. 

The highlight for me is the naval production and combat which reflects the strategic realities well even if the details are fuzzy from this high up. The fight for Burma is rather well done with the Japanese doing the Ichigo thing better than historically. The way the game handles Japanese supply and raw resources is excellent and very easy with surprisingly low overheads in terms of fiddly-ness.

I am playing the short Tipping the Balance 5 turn scenario and the Japanese is rolling over the Allies around Guadalcanal (with some excellent die rolls), there was a Battle of the Solomon Sea where the Japanese Carrier Fleet was able to surprise and sunk the entire U.S. Carrier Fleet, leaving the U.S. without Carriers in Sept/Oct of 1942. Pretty terrible. Probably would concede if it were a face-to-face game, but I will go through the motions for a couple more turns just to see what can be done about the situation and to get more comfortable with the rules.

I am still getting use to all the many moving parts and there were some glaring mistakes made by the Allies. Probably should of held back with attack for a couple of turns to build up and to out build and disrupt the Japs and ensure enough ground troops, air & sub support prior to moving into the fray. Probably should have bogged down the Japanese more in China & Burma to divert resources that way, as well as threaten their resource areas in China. 

Game doesn't compare with Empire of the Sun, that game is much more complex and detailed. This game also is quite different from Axis Empires: Dai Senso! which has a lot more complicated political system and even though its counter density is low, its still quite high compared to a block game. There are a ton of tables in that game whilst its buckets of dice for this game. The fog of war is great and I think makes this game stand out compare to the others, it makes naval games make so much more sense, and you now longer need all them search and encounter rules to emulate contact. Funny that this game didn't have dummy counters at all (not any use solo, but multiplayer..)

I will be updating the rating as I get more plays in...

(Forgot to mention: The production values are AMAZING, the map looks great and the spaces actually have enough room for the blocks! The map also uses a thicker than usual card stock, the blocks are simple by handsome. The rules were oddly arranged though, it wasn't done in the usually turn sequence order and I found myself jumping around a bit when learning and referencing. BUT the index at the back is a Godsend!)

See review also.

The timing in this game is clever, the way the naval and air systems have been grafted on the basic ground system really must have taken a lot of time and effort.  Getting it to work must have been a nightmare and it ends up working.  I think Rick Young has an outstanding understanding of getting nice timing mechanisms into games.

But I don't see the options here I need to see for a really long lasting game for me.  To me, it boiled down to this: Japan decides at the beginning to do one of four things: fight in China, fight in Burma, try to invade Australia or sit around and do nothing but the obligatory East Indies invasion and hope for a marginal victory.

So essentially the game boils down to a strong early offensive if you're the Japanese, then battening down the hatches and moving as little as possible (so as not to waste oil or transport).  The US will eventually come with insane forces so you have to hope to make them spend SAs, hope they don't roll sixes and sit your fleets in a threatening place with enough oil to respond for a major fleet action.  As the US, you will struggle to do anything for the first, say 5-10 turns lest they face the overwhelming Japanese navy.  Then you invade islands with as much force as possible and hope for high rolls.  To me there isn't enough tactical interest here to make this script interesting.

Beyond that the system had some things that soured me as well.  CBAs are reasonably lethal to ships, but generally attacking a fleet even with air superiority is suicide for your CBAs because of any enemy air and very strong AA.  That was frustrating--getting the drop on your opponent with a superior air force and seeing it virtually shredded because I decided to attack.  Additionally I felt there were some odd incentives to blob your fleet as a giant fleet for the AA protection and as the Japanese as a deterrent.  Finally, the air selection mechanism in combat is unsatisfying because the steps of planes available to you are not granular enough, making the whole assignment game a nuisance.

Have I just described the real war in the Pacific?  Yes.  So don't take this necessarily as an indictment of the designers historicity.  The game was well designed but it is not at the top of games I want to play again.  I found it very scripted and also sometimes frustrating.  That said, I got about 3-4 full campaigns out of it so I am no expert.  But the games did not make me want to become an expert either.

Marcus Island.  Marcus is not big enough to have an airfiled capable of B-29 operations.  yet, in AE, this is a strategic airbase space that allows the US to conduct B-29 raids on Japan.  While this maybe isn't a big deal to many, it means that the Western North Pacific is a viable strategic objective to the US, when it actually wasn't.  Check out a picture of Marcus Island and you can see why - the runway on the island is only 1300m and can't be any longer than that.  Tinian, an actual B-29 base, had a runway twice as long.  Even if you could take-off from such a runway, there is no room on that island for more than a token number of planes.

While Marcus broke this game for me, it isn't like there aren't other issues.  As with many Pacific War games, each side will create a mega-stack of ships with AA that will shoot down excessive airborne attackers.  I think the land-based air also has some issues in that you can take out defending counters by a simple raid attack; I think the Cactus Air Force at Guadalcanal showed that it was simply not possible to completely eliminate a defender with long-range attacks.  The digital loss of land based air (rather than gradual attrition) makes it possible to create gaps in the Japanese defenses that is just not realistic.

Eventually, someday, someone, will create a Pacific War game where carrier air power is modelled correctly, and CVs are not all bunched in a single alpha-stack, but this game isn't it.

My first impression was that this was a pretty clean system, which provides a good feel for the period.  Some of the rules lead the game down a historical path, but this is more on the resource level, where the Japanese were struggling with a dwindling oil supply.  The transport pool is also straight forward and adds flavor to the game.  The only thing I did not like were the dice (which says a lot!)

This is the best WWII Pacific War game experience I've had in a long time. I especially like that China is included (many Pacific games completely omit that front).  The fog of war is good, and the different abilities of the land based air and carrier base air units feel right.  I like the air allocation step in combat which requires you to designate which planes are CAP, escort/dogfight, and bombers.  Naval combat is dicey, but looking at the many surprising historical results of WWII Pacific combat, that seems appropriate in my humble opinion.  The game mechanics encourage the kind of island hopping strategies historically used.  The game feels a bit less scripted than Europe Engulfed, but that may be my inexperience (only 1 learning game and 2 real games so far).

Great looking game! The rules differ on some major point from its predecessor "Europe Engulfed" but the rules make sense and are well written. The game components are great (as usual) and the game-map fits on the dining table (measuring half the size of the EE map).

RATING: 3
The Europe Engulfed system ("hit on 6's") which works well when battles have 10-40 blocks per side doesn't work so well when most battles are much smaller, around 1-4 blocks per side. Too often too little or too much happens.

The restrictive naval movement rules makes the naval game one-sided. The Americans can do little until they are sufficently built up, then the Japanese collapse quickly.

Dare I say it an improvement on EE?  This game has the tension of EE plus a bit more with multiple excruciating decisions each turn.  Excellent recreation of the PTO but playable in a day.

It has taken a bit to get used to the sequence of play, but it works very well.  As the Japanese, you never feel like you have enough production.  It's easy to burn too much oil, so care must be taken.  Not enough oil to react and the Allies will go crazy throughout the Pacific.  And the Allies have to be patient.  Try and counter the Japanese early while building the forces for a strong counterattack.  Definitely, a fun game.

Like its older brother EE, this game sits just beyond the upper limit of complexity for me.  The gameplay itself often seems to flow nicely and suggests that with further play I may be able to forgive the dense 24 page rule book.  I enjoy the modifications to the naval and air rules in this game and I liked the way in which the oil, supply and building limitations constrain the Japanese options each turn.  I have only played the Tipping Point scenario so far but my enthusiasm for a longer scenario is seriously restrained by the fact that my opponent and I spend a good deal of time with our noses in the rulebook each session.

I have tried the 1942 and 1943 scenarios with this. I liked it for the short sessions we had. I thought the antiaircraft rules were too brutal and no fun until I watched DVDs and read book about mid and late carrier raids by the Japanese on US Task Forces. It was very well modeled (I felt from what I saw), but made the later war a bit less aggressive than I would have liked. The Japanese have to suck thumb (as my opponent said) until Leyte Gulf or its equivalent wipes them out. The China fighting got a bit silly with the group we had. Like many Pac War games, it seems abstracted rather less well than it could have been. Keen to play this one as the full war. I'd even play Japan!

RATING: 9
Really interesting.  Novel mechanics allowing for very tactical game play (the implementation of the oil expenditure by the Japs, transport, and the massive importance of influence over sea zones), plus the higher level strategy involving what types of units you want to build for your country and where to direct your forces, have me just wanting more play time with this one.

EDIT Nov 15':  To play this game right (...by the rules) takes some work.  The rules have some very vague sections leaving the players to decipher them.  At this point in my life however I have limited time for games requiring this level of dedication.  Still though, the best PTO game I have played.

Let me preface by saying that I love its predecessor  EE and I have given AE multiple plays before rating.

I have found that the game just plays too slow, kinda boring for me.  

It may be the nature of the theater.  Admittedly, I don't have any other experience with Pacific War games aside from A&A and that doesn't really count.

The design felt solid.  The naval combat system was interesting but no real thrill. 

If you like slow and methodical, this is your game.  If not, look elsewhere.

Wargaming friends who love this theatre say this game is amazing.  The game is also highly supported by designer Rick Young here and at CSW.

RATING: 6.5
Well, it has lots of ships and planes and half the world as the battlefield . . . but.  For a relatively simple system (I like EE) there is just too much chrome, too many fiddly modifiers, and a desperate need to go to quarterly turns.  Running Japan is an amusing and frustrating tight rope, while the Americans are like a firehose with a kink in it, a slow trickle at first but once they get rolling they are unstoppable and even the last, great battle between the fleets only bought my Japanese two months as their economy and transport net got trashed.  I liked many parts of AE, but unless you can whack about three hours off the '42 campaign game I probably will never have the time to play it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
For a block game: very nice and manageable.  System plays fine at this scale.  Japan has to strike very quickly and successfully.  The Allies can be delayed if Japan does very well at the start causing Australia to fall in my first game.  India/China is a quagmire for Japan: period.

I think this game is great.  It's strategic and it's tough.  The rules are complex, but the player aids and playbook help a ton.  Looking forward to Europe engulfed.  Wish I had more time for it.

This game mirrors WWII in the pacific very well.  As the japanese you do not have enough oil to do everything you want to do, even though you have number superiority early on.  You also have to guard your supply lines.

As the USA, you have to hold on, until production gets you up to speed.

Received 10DEC07. This game playable and gives you a sense of making historical decisions--the excellent oil and transport rules for the Japanese are a perfect example of this. The persistent influence of land based air is well modeled and provides an intuitive rationale for taking/holding island bases in a vast ocean (only WiF does it as well). The sequence of play is just superb; it covers all aspects of the Pacific war and is easily grasped (for some reason I could never "get" the the sequence of play in Fire in the Sky). Excellent components, historical, challenging, fun--a 10 for me! I'm thinking about doing a more thorough comparison of this game with the CDG, Empire of the Sun. 

2017 UPDATE: I actually think the FitS sequence of play is easier to understand in solo play, and that has to do with the rules of AE--it's just very difficult to look up rules because they are spread over multiple locations. FitS was difficult to play solo, but AE was even harder. EotS is by far the better game to play solo, even though it has cards.

excellent game, well balanced, great tension, not overly complex.  I liked the inclusion of a manageable 3-4 hour scenario, in addition to the 6-9 hour marathon that the full campaign is (for when we have time).  Like the uniqueness from the fact the game's set in the Pacific--not too many great games on the subject imo.  All in all, a top boardgame.

Having a chance to play this thrice, I'm really impressed.  It captures a lot of the challenges of WWII Pacific without heavy rules overhead.  And it's fun.

Update, 3/10/14: What makes this game work so well is the naval interception system.  Combined with the blocks and the Japanese oil system, both sides are constantly asking, "Do I really want to try and disrupt this naval move?  Is this a critical place to try and confront the enemy fleet?"  Feints are rewarded, and a single bad decision can cripple your navy.

Be warned: This has a very high-variance combat system. This fits the Pacific War to a tee, but it makes every naval combat a throw of the dice.

Anders als bei "Europe Engulfed", das den Seekrieg nur in abstrakter Form abhandelt, stehen die maritimen Auseinandersetzungen (es wird sogar noch unterschieden zwischen Tag- und Nachtk√§mpfen) nat√ºrlicherweise im Mittelpunkt dieses Grand Strategy-Games. Hier ist langfristigere Planung gefragt, z.B. beim Ressourcen-Management und der sich ggf. √ºber mehrere Z√ºge erstreckenden Produktion neuer Einheiten. Zwar verlangt die Sequence of Play vordergr√ºndig ein IGOUGO-verfahren, aber der jeweils nicht aktive Spieler hat vielfach die M√∂glichkeit unmittelbar in das Geschehen einzugreifen, was die bei solchen Spielen √ºbliche "Downtime" angenehm reduziert. Insbesondere die unterschiedlichen wie zahlreichen strategischen M√∂glichkeiten machen dieses Spiel zu einem intellektuellen Wettstreit.

The ideal amount of abstraction to convey the operational and, very partially, tactical flavour of WW2 in the shortest possible time.

After mulling on it a while, I've knocked my rating down a point.  The Special Actions just aren't quite as cool as those of Europe Engulfed.  And the system seems to encourage you to turtle, rather than attack, unless you have overwhelming strength.  I understand that that's true of naval warfare in general, and not just a product of this game, but it does make the game a little less fun.

Don't get me wrong, it's still a fine game.  My one face-to-face play was extremely tense and a good experience.  I just think EE came out better.

Terrific design and development (w/excellent production values) that hits on almost all cylinders. Elegant system that manages to reduce a very complex situation down to manageable terms. 

Balances maneuver, combat, production, and resource management, coupled with a plethora of strategy options.

It does require very careful attention-to-detail while learning, but the sequence of play is intuitive and everything is properly laid out in the rules.

I really like just about every aspect of this game so far (though the tendency for players to mass their fleets does concern me).

I'd rather play some other Pacific War titles, but this one is solid.

Another great block game from the creators of Europe Engulfed.  Fewer blocks and a smaller map, but it feels more complex.  Gives a good feeling of why the  Pacific War was so difficult to prosecute.  My advice: plan on your first play being a "training" session (use the short tournament scenario) with a lot of rules-book page-flipping and head-scratching; your second play will be much better for it.  Bonus advice: cover the map with plexiglas.  Fascinating game.

Culled - First wave; Comics Place contribution.

Why we culled it: I held this game for over 4 years, just waiting for an opportunity to play it. Block games don't solo very well, and operational level war games tend to require a particular crowd - a crowd that I haven't really managed to cultivate. It looks wonderful and I have little doubt that it is a great game. But it was time to be honest with myself that I was a poor fit for this game, and it was high time that it found a better home.

RATING: 6
A rating of 6 indicates that I'm willing to play as and when. In reality I suspect I'm very unlikely to play. This isn't because it's a bad game, it's because the learning curve is steep and I don't think I won't to go through the agony of re-learning this in the future.The game deserves at least a 6 from me maybe even a 7 or 8, even though I'm unlikely to play it again. It appears to have used ideas from other Pacific games and come up with a system which appears fairly complex, until you adjust to it, and IMO models this campain better than the others I have played (ViTP, EoTS, FiTS).The way it shows the USA gearing up for war and overwhelming the IJN war production is brilliant but simple. The way the IJN is straggled for lack of oil is brilliant and appears spot on. The naval battles are tense and again appear to model the situation really well.However I'm not sure I'll play it again. As stated earlier it has a steep learning curve and there are other games on my to play list. I'm not sure I will want to make the effort to relearn the game when time has passed and I've forgotten the rules.No going to sell though just in case....

Really slick counterpart to [gameid=6205].  Has the same agonizing feeling of "too much to do, too little time and WERPS," especially for Japan.  Japan absolutely must use every trick in the book to keep the US off their back as long as possible, which means building up a navy, a supply network, and an air force, while still maintaining a land war against China, India, and Australia, but of course there's no way to do all of those things.  

I like the treatment of the naval influence, though it takes well over half of a game to really get the naval rules down.  This game has the advantage of being a bit more open than Europe Engulfed, as there's no all-or-nothing equivalent to Russia and Barbarossa.  China, India, or the historical Pacific/Australia strategy all are legitimate strategies, more so than, say, conquering England in EE.

A very tedious game. There is a lot of meat to this one. I don't know how anyone finishes this one in eight hours. This is the type of game that you set up on the dining room table and play over the course of a week or two. That being said I enjoyed it and it didn't seem like we played for as long as we did. We played for 9 and a half hours and got to May of 1943 before the Japanese surrendered after the allies had decimated their CBA. 
Still much to learn.

RATING: 6
I thought all this game was missing was victory points and a final scoring phase. It is a race game - first to achieve the goal wins. And as such, with one player far enough ahead, you can see the win coming a few turns ahead which renders it pointless continuing at that time. The mechanic is neat though, and it has potential, but I would probably house-rule it if I owned it, and add in some scoring elements, which really is against the designer's intention.

The comments here had originally turned me off of Albion, but now, having played it, it turns out to be an interesting game with both strategy and tactics, and almost no sign of luck. There are several things going on that a player has to keep his eye on, and there is a fair amount of player interaction. The bits are quite nice, but the board is a tad on the drab side. Albion REALLY needs to have some player aid cards, though. To say the theme is pasted on is a bit of an exaggeration, and it's considerably better themed than Herr Wrede's Carcassonne. Nevertheless, there is the distinct smell of glue in the air.

Too slow to catch on. Maybe if it were the only game I had, I'd rate it higher. But for the time I have, I'm going to pick something different. This one just feels a bit or a reach and a game of vast wastelands of uninteresting interactions with the occasional entertainment break.

When Albion was released, for unknown reasons it only came with German rules. Unfortunately English rules failed to materialise for many months later, by which time any potential buzz for the game had long since died. The game was bought by a friend of mine and it just laid gathering dust on his shelf. It was passed over and forgotten.

Until March 2017 when we dug it out and worked through the 6 pages of (English) rules and jumped in. And what a pleasant surprise. This is a very tight and well balanced game. Despite no direct player interaction, you need to race to build your forts and settlements and you can back stab other players by provoking the picts in areas where opponents have weaker defences. Not to mention the chance to move picts into areas other players are developing.

Not a long game but with quite a bit to think about. It was well worth waiting for but what a shame it missed the boat for the English speaking world because I think this would have been a lot more successful if it had been released with English rules.

A simple and unfortunate boring game. Wish-rinse-repeat. After 2 turns, the game got repetitive and had no more to offer. Having to restart from square one every turn compounds the drabby feeling.

RATING: 7
This was pretty much exactly what I was hoping for: a quick-playing logistical puzzle with just enough uncertainty to allow for some measured risk-taking or threatening gestures toward the other players. The rules are hard to wrap your head around for some reason, though the game itself is simple enough. It probably has a ceiling on the number of plays, but should be fun getting there. Definitely hard to know what to do on your first play; an experienced player should trounce a new one almost every time.

RATING: 6.5
Liked this much more than I thought I would. It reminds me somewhat of Royal Palace, where you need presence out on the board to get more presence on the board, and you really do build a little engine as the game progresses. There is a very fragile balance you have to strike between getting multiple goods, getting a variety of goods, beefing up your defenses, and building your settlements. Bad decisions can quickly put you behind, though, and two or three bad decisions can create a runaway leader in no time. Otherwise, it can be a tight, close game between equally experienced players. Works surprisingly well with two.

By the designer of Carcassonne.  A colonization type game where you're using settlers to build buildings (ramparts, fortresses, resource plants, and settlements) in a race to be the first to three settlements.  A euro game with enough theme and differences to make it stand out, but perhaps it won't have the legs for longevity.

Demo'd this in Essen and liked it. Amigo generously donated a copy to Beyond Monopoly! and I finally played it through. I liked it, despite making poor decisions. I spread out to thin and too fast, when you really want to build up you base before pushing for the win. It was easy to play and make decisions, with some screwage, but a little slow for what was happening. Nice game, nice bits, nice to see a proper island game for once.

Lots going on in this game.  I need to play again.  I picked this up in a math trade, and it's got all the elements of a good Euro, but this annoying thing that forces you to always start from the same spot on the board each time you complete an action.

Not sure why this game is rated so poorly.  A tight efficiency game.  But if you can't see the player interaction, you're not playing right.  And if you think that "only" having variability in the barbarian discs isn't enough, then you're not being pushed hard enough to play it fine by your opponents.

This is a fun, light civilization building game. Players can build cities and fortresses which increase both the number of actions that can be played and the number of spaces that can be moved. Increasing movement is important since after building, the player moves back to the start space. There are also four resource areas at increasing distance from the start, so movement needs to be increased to collect the resorces. Resources are needed to build and later to upgrade the cities and fortresses. There are also facedown tokens in each region that can be friendly or foe. The friendlys have no effect, but the foes require your defensive strength be equal or higher. The first player to complete three of the highest level cities leads to an end game round. A tie breaker is the number of foes in your city territories. I am surprised this is rated so low. I think it may be too deterministic for some folks. There is potential randomness from the friendly or foe tokens, but it is easy to build up your strength so you don't have to worry about them. Winning seems to get down to some subtle differences in how you develop your territories.

Nifty components (those little fish tokens...), decent production quality all around (especially the insert). Better than we anticipated. It's basically an abstract strategy game that can handle four people. We intentionally tried opposite strategies for reaching the goal and ended up getting there at the same time anyway, so this may be pretty dull as a two player game. Probably not worth the $30 it goes for right now, but I paid half that and feel like it was a solid purchase.

This is really an action point system with some neat tricks.

First, is it odd that this reminds me of Attika?

You can gain resources or move & build. You can build or upgrade one building in a region. Other people with higher level building get a piece of the resources you paid to build or upgrade. Your goal is to build and then upgrade all 3 of your cities to level 4.

2 plays with 3 and 4 so far with equal tension and competition. Victory was achieved in a different manner each time.

Wrede made another good game that I'm certain will be as overlooked as Pompeii.

It's a kind of engine building game. Not very variable, so probably will get old soon, but somehow my kids like it very much so I might be playing this quite often.
Update after 7 plays: I think I'm beginning to get to the point where I've "played out" Albion. There is a more or less optimal way of developing, and since there is very little player interaction and very little that the game throws in your way, you won't have to change plans often.

It's fairly easy to learn and play, and has great bits and a beauty of a board.

An optimization game: build your economy in the most efficient way. An interesting excercise, it's worth a few plays. However, in the long run I don't think it has much replayability. After a few plays you can script the optimal path and their is little of nothin your opponents can do about it as it plays rather solitary.

Players race their forces on the map in order to gather resources so they can build settlements (victory condition is 3).  You can attack and defend which adds a needed element.

A reasonable game, but flawed in a few ways.  The theme seems rather stuck-on, with several rules not making much sense (e.g. legionnaires only add to your defensive bonus for the province that they're in, but ramparts affect the whole country).  There are opportunities for screwage early on in the game, but once people have built up their strength and most of the Pict tiles have been flipped there isn't much that can be done to pull back a player who has taken the lead.  In its favour, the turns pass quickly, meaning that there isn't too much downtime.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Has a nice little engine-building scheme where you have to balance between production, movement rate and defense. Not just pure calculation though, since the opponents' maneuvers might cause your buildings to explode. The system for slowing down the fastest builder is also a nice touch. Still, I'm concerned about replayability: Because the only randomness in the setup is where the naughty bits end up, the game might easily degenerate into a set of predetermined opening moves. It's a bit longish, too.

I like the offbeat components and the general atmosphere to the game, but it's a worry that the game seems virtually solvable and often is over well before the appointed end. I don't think Albion has as much life-span as I would really like in a game.

(30) This game is greatly hindered by the fact that the end game is so predictable.  I've played it 3 times, and each time the game ended several turns early when one player said something along the line of "I can win in 3 turns, can anyone beat that?" and when the answer was no, everyone just stopped and moved on to the next game.  It's a shame, because the game is actually pretty clever and interesting, but that end always leaves you walking away from it feeling somewhat less then satisfied.

Finally played the game last night. With only one of us a Eurogamer, we pretty much played a learning game, with all of us flailing around one way or another (protip: Don't upgrade to three fish when you only have one wood!). I can see how a runaway leader problem can occur if one person "gets it" and the others don't -- sorta like many Eurogames I've played.

A unique mechanic are the Picts, and I don't see this mechanic in most Eurogames. (Mebbe Game of Thrones at most.) Wanna dork over your opponent? Build something near your Pict neighbors and have 'em do your dirty work for you! Picts are worse than bee nests, I swear.

Didn't have any problems with the English translation (more than the usual getting lost after not reading the rules for awhile), although I'm used to ridiculously complex 40-page Ameritrash rulebooks. I'd say the rules are more complex than simpler Eurogames and that the components would imply.

(Bought as part of the great Works £7.99 sale of 2011). 2-player: The components are very nice, I like the implementation of theme through the mechanics which make sense to me. But overall, it seems to be missing something. At the moment it plays like Settlers without random resource collection (much like the Roman themed iPhone settlers clone, is this a coincidence?). The bones of the game and the bits are too nice not to hope that somebody can come up with an interesting variation - maybe having different win condition (eg earning vps), more ways to directly screw with each other (legionaries being able to seize 'tributes' from the production plants) and maybe even dice added to combat.

Somewhat interesting, but not really.

You win by building your 3 settlements, and developing them all to level 4; one of them must be in one of the designated areas on the board, furthest from the starting area. Along the way, you build fortifications for defense, forts to help with movement (get more movement points, and eventually allow you to jump-start a settler from the fort location instead of from the starting area), and resource-plants. The previous stages of Settlements give you either extra Settlers, or Legionnaires (to help defend). You build by collecting resources: start with level-1 fish- and lumber-plants. Whenever you build/develop something in a region with pict tokens, picts may attack (about 50% chance) -- your ramparts (anywhere on the board) and legionnaires (in that region) help defend.

On your turn, you can only either collect resources, or move/build. So the game is a race to build/develop the various things most efficiently. You need settlers to build stuff; you need movement to get them to the build site (max 1 building/player/region), ramparts to defend (if you to succumb to a pict attack, lose 1 level development in that region), and settlements to win the game.

Probably worth a few plays, but not exactly exciting. Maybe if it's played very quickly it will be better?

[i]Posted: 2/8/09, Rated: 6[/i]

I wasn't even aware of the [i][thing=6368]King Arthur[/thing][/i] board game from which this card game was derived, although I am quite familiar with the recent trend of translating board games into card games.  It's a quick way to earn some extra money from fans of the original.  I didn't have any preconceptions for [i]King Arthur - The Card Game[/i]; how well would it fare?

The game itself is a basic two-stage resource-gathering exercise, executed almost entirely with cards.  This time around the [person=2]good doctor[/person] has chosen an exciting theme to complement the game mechanics.  The idea of knights sallying forth to vanquish adversaries, trying to complete heroic quests is always a good one.  The card graphics greatly support these goals.

There is a subtlety to the end-game scoring, where completed quests (public information) plus the value of adversary cards remaining in each player's hand (private but theoretically trackable information) contributes to her score.  A small nit-pick: the backs of the adversary cards should have been the same as the knight cards: doing so would have prevented other players from gaining any insight to the numbers of each you may be holding.

I originally said the game was executed "almost exclusively" with cards.  The exceptions to this statement are the "seals," which are used in the advanced version of the game.  These chits add a delaying mechanism to the game, with opportunities for players to pay double to obtain an immediate result.  Further plays with these strategic options may increase the game's rating.

For some unknown reason, the box is grossly oversized for its contents.  I expect a card game to be much smaller, like [i][thing=215]Tichu[/thing][/i] or [i][thing=5782]Coloretto[/thing][/i].  Its size is frustrating for storage or for travel.  Resolved: [i]King Arthur - The Card Game[/i] uses tried and true mechanics, applies a fun theme, and is capable of varying depths of play.  It isn't the Holy Grail of gaming, but it's a fun quest for a rainy day.

p: This abstract game could have been given a whole variety of themes, so I can only guess that Knizia had it lying around, and when Ravensburger asked him for a cardgame to tie in with his high profile boardgame, he gave them this, eventhough they have nothing in common. The production is nice, the pictures are pretty, but for me the theme atmosphere was completely absent: I was collecting numbers and colours to pay the required amounts that earned me victory points. What King Arthur?

We played advanced rules  with five players, and by the time you got your turn the choices on offer either matched your cards or not. "Hand management" suggests more strategic control or oppertunities than the game actually offered me. If the cards on offer get replenished, there are usual one or two very cheap cards up for grabs, and if that happens before your turn, all you can do is start on the longer columns, giving the same players who benefited from instant pick-ups, also the option to improve on their advantage by changing their strategy based on your play. The victory point cards have different prices and requirement combos, but there are too few of these in play to counter cheap pickings, and towards the end it's very easy to get locked out.

Saying that, it plays quick, and is engaging enough to treat it as a leightweight filler. It's not a bad game, just one that leave little or no impressions. From Knizia I expect more than "another thing you can do with cards". Next!

RATING: 6.5
Having a lot of fun with this. Playing with the kids (7 & 5) while reading them the King Arthur stories at bedtime. Not sure I would be too interested in playing it with adults but that was not why I bought it. It is a good introduction to this sort of game, set collecting, getting the kids to grasp the concepts of relative value, calculating what other players might be going for etc. Have not played with the advanced rules yet but looking forward to bringing in this extra level of complexity. (Poor little buggers, what chance have they got! I have even introduced a system of pocket money bonuses based on the number of games they have grasped . . .)

It's a good medium-length filler (20-30 minutes). I know why I like this game, but I can't figure out why everyone else I play with does, also. I love the art, and I'm a sucker for anything with knights. The game doesn't seem like much, though, so I'm surprised that all three of my groups like it as much as they do. They all request it on occasion. Weird.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Turn knight cards into monster cards, then trade in monster cards for rewards. Very little inefficiency possible leads to very close games, except when played with the "advanced" rules, where positioning comes into play. Much better that way. 
Edit: I've been playing incorrectly, not awarding points for leftover killed monsters. Oops. Above concerns are likely moot. Time to drag this one out again.

A version of rummy, in this case, set collection within set collection. Knight cards in three suits are collected and paid to garner "adversaries" of four types (colours) of varying value which in turn are cashed in to complete "quests" also of varying value whose cost involves combining different types and values of adversaries you've collected. That's about it.

I played it with two of my grandchildren (aged 7 and 9) who loved it. Whether to go for the cheap cards and turn them in as soon as you can to get whatever you can, or hold out for the more valuable adversaries/quests is at the heart of whatever hand-management you might find here. Not particularly deep for sure but consider the target audience which I think my grands represent. The art is cool and is what ties in the theme as all the cards represent something found in the Arthurian legends (King Mark, the Green Knight, the Misty Castle and so on). In a simple card game how much more could you do with it?

Beats vanilla Rummy or Go Fish by miles (which are its competition)...

Three plays: twice with two players (basic games), once with five (advanced). Feeling so far: A pretty good game with familiar mechanism of "collect X to thereby earn Y". Like Blue Moon City, this mechanism seems here designed to lead to close scores.  Especially in the basic game, I feel a sense of X:Y gear ratio values turning, grinding out score value for fractional advantage, when calculating what to collect, turn in, and shoot for.  Leads to a different kind of Knizia game tension.  Choices, timing, goals, worry... Will my opponent foil my efficient gear ratio intentions?  Despite my talk of gears, I enjoy the artwork a lot and feel a bit of sense of the theme.  Furthermore, the advanced game adds unexpected challenge; I don't have firm idea how to take advantage of it yet (timing?) but I like it. My opinion is still evolving. While it is easy to play, I don't think it's as light as some commentators (rewarding heavier thought for competitive X:Y gear efficiency maximization). Has depth, I think, and feels rewarding, but I'm not sure otherwise about the fun factor. But I don't think I'll give up on it.

Met een combinatie van ridderkaarten worden tegenstanderkaarten gekocht die punten waard zijn. Met een combinatie van de tegenstanderkaarten kunnen echter ook opdrachtkaarten gekocht worden die normaal gezien meer punten waard zijn dan de gecombineerde tegenstanderkaarten. Jammer dat ridder- en tegenstanderkaarten geen namen dragen uit de King Arthur saga. Het zou dit simpele spel een stuk meer themagevoel geven.

Nearly zero theme, feels like a revision of Knizia's own "Res Publica" (collect sets of cards, be the first to cash them in). Games are pretty silent and intense, with a certain amount of tension. Although there seems to be no strategy at first (most players just cash in the quickest possible cards) this has more mathematical precision to it than one thinks, which in the end comes as no surprise with  a "Reiner-Game".

A fairly typical small Knizia card game, taking a few elements from other Knizia games and stirring them a little. As such, it is certainly not a ground-breaking design but I do think it is noteworthy that even his "second hand" designs of old (well, okay, fine, it's not that old) manage to come out as reasonable games that stand well on their own with just a few mechanical tweaks.

This is one of those 'theme pasted onto them' games of Herr Knizia.

The game is not bad, but not that exciting. Luck is a HUGE factor. Draw a lot of 'double' helmet cards and you're very likely to win the game - it's that simple. 

The decisions involved are almost a no-brainer, so the game kind of plays itself.

RATING: 6
Very simple, but not bad.  You essentially trade sets of cards (knights) for other cards which you try to also acquire in sets (enemies).  You then trade those sets (enemies) in to complete quests and score points.  The knights you get are random, but the enemies you get are up to you, and can be picked strategically to try to finish quests before other players.  Play with the advanced rules.

A Kerek Asztal kártyajátékosai
Barátom jóvoltából sikerült megismerkednem Knizia „mester” 2005-ös kiadású kártyajátékával, amelynek témáját az általam kedvelt Arthur király mondakör képezi.
Első alkalommal az egyszerű játékmódot próbáltuk ki. Kezünkben lévő 3 féle színű lovagjainkkal (1-es vagy 2-es erősségű azonos színű lapok felhasználásával) 4 féle színű ellenségeket győzünk le (1-5 erősségűeket) a játéktérre előkészített lapok közül, majd a legyőzött ellenségek eldobásával meg tudunk szerezni egy-egy pontot érő kártyát (teljesítünk egy kalandot) és húzunk 1 lovagkártyát. Az előbbiek helyett választhatunk 2 lovagkártya felhúzását is. Megjelenik Merlin is, aki „jokerként” bármilyen színű lovagcsapatunkat tudja erősíteni. Amennyiben az előkészített lapok közül bármelyik színből 4 van lent, a játék folyik tovább; ha nem, akkor megkezdhetjük (nem kötelező) az ellenséglapok feltöltését egészen addig, amíg valamelyik színből 4 lap kerül lehelyezésre. Az előkészített 13 kaland teljesítésekor vagy az ellenségkártyák elfogyásakor a játék véget ér és a megszerzett pontok alapján kihirdetjük a Bajnokot. Ebben a változatban az egyszerű szabályok mellett hátrány, hogy egy-egy szerencsésebb laphúzással és lapfeltöltéssel egyes játékosok nagyobb előnyre tehetnek szert. Viszont kellemes családi játék hangulata van, amely bátran ajánlható kisebbeknek is.
Másodjára már haladó szabályokkal játszottunk és számomra ez kifejezetten kellemes meglepetés volt. Van lehetőség taktikázni, kombózgatni, „mélyebb” játékot játszani, persze ennek megfelelően „bonyolultabb” szabályokkal. Azért itt sem kell „heavy euro” játékra gondolni, mégis jobban tetszett, megjelent a játékosok közötti interakció is.
Összességében korrekt játékot ismertem meg (rövid szabálymagyarázat, gyors játékmenet, idejétmúlt grafika), amelynek 2 játékmódja ideális családi játékká teszi azt azok részére, akik kedvelik a lovagos, „artúrkirályos” (esetleg „gyaloggalopos”) témákat. A kiadása óta eltelt 11 év alatt változott a társasjátékok világa is, mégis ajánlom kipróbálásra azoknak, akik a fentiek alapján próbát tennének vele (és természetesen egyáltalán hozzájutnak).

his is a very basic conversion game (collect adversary cards with same-colored sets of knights; collect scoring adventure cards that require certain combinations of adversary cards) that had been on my trade list for a while even without trying. But now it's not for sale anymore: it's a game for 8-year-olds but my 5year-old was good in it and he really enjoyed the theme (that was the reason why I opened this box for him). So now it’s a keeper, not as a game for adults but as a game for kids: :thumbsup::thumbsup:

Intringuing drafting game with good angst and decent amount of strategy.

Knizia did a good job (as always) of setting up competing goals and making it hard to determine priorities/value. Rating could go up with more plays.

Arthur király lovagjaiként küldetésekre indulunk. A küldetések megoldásához bizonyos színű, vagy értékű legyőzött ellenségeket kell felmutatni, akiket korábban lovagjaink segítségével pusztítottunk el.

Card game by Knizia where one conquers foes represented by cards. To conquer a foe, play cards out of your hand to match the foe strength. Later, foes can be used to exchange for trophies  each worth VPs.  Trophies vary in cost eg, a trophy for 10 VPs cost 5 red strength, some require numerical values, eg 12 strength foes earn 20 VPs. Game ends when trophies are exhausted, or the foe stack is depleted. There is some luck in the strength cards you draw (a few cards in the deck are wild cards or double strength). There is a little bit of tactics on which column of foes to conquer, or do you do repeated attacks so you have enough foes to claim a trophy ahead of an opponent. It's a quick game and fairly light.

Holy Grail, Excalibur, Green Knights and Battles with the Saxons cards?  Sounds "Arthurian" enough to me!  Nice looking cards.  Card game plays well and is easy to learn.

*sigh*. Yes, it works. It's fine. But boring, themeless and mathematical. Collect sets. Trade in sets for VP's, getting as much set-value to VP leverage as possible. The trick to winning is to happen to get most of the doubler and wild cards, start first and be the one to end the game. I'm not sure whether to say Knizia at his best or his worst, but hopefully you know what I mean.

Nice little [b]cardgame[/b]. The theme however is even [i]more[/i] pasted on this game than the majority of Reiner Knizia games. There's a lot of [i]better[/i] [b]rummygame[/b]s out there, but this one is a nice variation. I usually play this with my [i]mother[/i] since she loves it.

A few plays in with the advance rules which makes the game more interesting as it is all about timing: should I play 1 now or just draw 2, when to double the attack, reduce a column of 4 etc.

Probably best with 3 as it is easier to follow who has picked up what cards so as to deduce which adventures will be contested. 

The adventure layout is important as placing them haphazardly makes it difficult to orientate as to the best cards to go for. 
Also causing a problem is the similar backed decks causing mix ups in drawing cards, so put the adversary deck out of reach. 

One final thing I would consider is to reduce the amount of number crunching by all players turning over the adventure cards leaving only the points they are ahead by (possibly using the discarded adversary cards for small point differences). All this should remove the distracting maths of who is leading in the game and provide more focus on what adversaries are needed to get in front.

Strange thing in this game is that I get a better feel for the struggle of the knights in the Arthurian legend here than I do with the "full house" or "2 pairs" card play in Shadows over Camelot. But I keep wondering do I really care for the Legend?

Play only with variant. Underrated in Germany. One of the great lighter card games of Reiner. Fun with all ages. Some not so trivial decisions here... And beautiful artwork, too.

Update: still very good after lot of plays. Imho one of Reiner's best family-friendly card games.

The game itself is pretty abstract, and the theme is pasted on. Nevertheless, this is an okay light filler.

Quick abstract. Nothing inspiring. Luck in the card draw, turn order, stars makes the contest. I don't mind it, but only because it's a short affair.

OOF!  What the hell!  The fact that this game has absolutely nothing to do with King Arthur is the least of my issues with this "game".  If Knizia didn't have his name on the box, this droll little stinker would never have been published.  This really is stuck in the doldrums.  I won the first game without making any significant decisions.  I'd be searching for any real choices in this game but I highly doubt I'll play this again.  Examine:

Draw some cards hope for doubles or wild cards.  
Buy cards on the cheap.  
Turn them in for points available.  
See who wins.

joy.

I thought it was good for the light filler that it is.  The mediocre comments from all my geek buddies make me think I should re-consider.  You need to watch what others are collecting and leave your options open for which cards you can buy on the cheap.  Not very taxing but a light card drafting jaunt.  2008/11/06

This is far too gentle. More gentle perhaps than Lost Cities or Jaipur. While it perfectly pleasant, I can't find anything to make me recommend it.

The end game is also quite unsatisfactory, with the game simply ending immediately on the penultimate card being taken.

Another Knizia favorite, it's just different enough from some of our other K' games that it really hits the spot.  Really nothing to do with Arthur, though... a pure abstract with a slapped-on theme.

Played several times (with 3 to 5 players). A light game with some easy decisions and some luck, which makes a nice filler. There is more in this game than I thought at first - and it is not related at all, playwise, to Knizia's King Arthur. The advanced rules are not much more difficult, yet they add something interesting to the game, and I always use them.

Okay game, but not Knizia's finest work by a long shot. Mechanically, it's rather uninspired set collection. Has the virtue of being super simple to explain. The advanced version with the seals seems like it'd have a bit more strategy, but I haven't tried it yet.

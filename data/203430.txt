RATING: 6
I enjoyed the game right up until I was down to my last card, which I happened to be the first to achieve.

At that point it suddenly became obvious that any clever play that might have brought me here was now behind me - I had been robbed of any further decisions to make.  Each turn now consisted of:  play my solitary card;  watch as another player or players invariably beat it;  draw another card.  After several more rounds of drawing a card and playing it someone else eventually went out.

I didn't mind who won - it was just dull to play the last half of the game without doing anything.  In fact I didn't even need to stay at the table at that point - another player could simply draw and reveal the card for me.

All the fun of the game is to be had while you still have 2-5 cards - after that you rely on luck going your way.

So I'd be tempted to house rule it that the game is won once you get down to one card rather than zero.

Abluxxen (Linko) is much better as it plays with a very similar mechanism but doesn't fall flat in the end game.

2 plays / 6 players

LIKE: Interesting group dynamics with combining totals and flushing cards. I enjoyed how quickly players could get new cards if they have a weaker one.

DISLIKE: Seems like the dynamics work better with more players. Lots of luck in the draws.

OVERALL: It's a light card game-- I call it Pretzels & Beer gaming. The interesting dynamics are when a player is in the lead and the others attempt to build up lower valued cards to flush other players. Otherwise, I felt the weaker cards were terrible and useless. Therefore, with less players, a group "2" card would be worthless against anything greater than a 6, therefore diminishing that group dynamic. With 5 or more players, its better than Uno or Red7.

I am impressed. A new take on the small "Get-rid-of-your-cards-or-die-trying" card game, and it works like a charm. Short, nasty, brutish, and far from solitary. 
Probably best with 5+ players.
All the way up there with Sticheln.

Fast little card game in which you're trying to be the first to empty your hand of cards, but the twist is you're 'beating' other cards, and there's a mechanic where players whose cards tie are added together for a higher total. If you're into stuff like Linko or No Thanks, then this one is worth trying.

An experience where any chance of applied skill is removed progressively until you get to the last card. At that point it is exposed for the absolute lottery that it is. Some laughs during prevent this from being a little better than Snap!

A light card game that works well for a larger group. I haven't played enough to know the nuances of the game but it seems like winning takes a certain amount of luck since getting rid of the last card doesn't afford much choice. Doesn't seem like a game meant to be taken that seriously.

---------------------------------------------------------
Quick Rules:
A simple and quick playing card game where the goal is to be the first to get rid of all your cards. On your turn you place one of the cards from your hand onto the table. Any card previously played with a lower number gets thrown to the discard pile and any players discarding have to draw a replacement card. The big trick to the game is that matching numbers combine to make larger numbers, making them harder to knock out (three people at the table have twos in play, they count as a combined six)(two players have 14s out, they are a 28) If your card is the highest card in play and play gets back to you, you(and anyone with a in play matching yours) push your card into the discard pile and you don't draw.
------------------------------------------------------
I've really liked Friedemann Friese games in the past... Power Grid(The card game I like more, but the normal is good too.), Landlord, America, Friday... he's done a lot of good stuff. I was actually really excited for Fabled Fruit and was trying to buy it, but it was sold out(think I dodged a bullet)and this was released the same day so I decided to give it a try. 

The first few games of this did not go over well. The pace of the game was slow considering you had so few choices to make. Players really enjoyed breaking other players hearts and making them redraw cards. The "slow roll" took over the game. Nobody worked together to get stuff pushed through. It took forever to play, and for experienced players it overstayed it's welcome quickly. I boxed it up and sent it to shelf purgatory for a few months.

A few weeks ago this game got a second chance and it's surprisingly been playing well. Even at 7-8 the plays have been going 10ish minutes. Better yet, I've managed to play it with people I can't stand, without any difficulties because there is no real game play. I am starting to think this game is unbreakable, as long as one player shames slow players into making their moves quick.

Bottom line; If you like simple card games I'd absolutely take a look at this game. It's creeping into No Thanks territory.

Fuji Flush was the highlight of the night. A relatively straight forward deck with values from 2 through 20 with the deck containing a higher proportion of lower value cards. The aim of the game is to get rid of your entire hand, but that's harder then that sounds in this game... You need to determine when its best to cooperate with other players and when its best to make them discard and redraw what they've played.

Quick, easy to learn, really fun, you instantly want to restart a game after finishing one. I would nevertheless have two issues : the "luck-side" when you have just one card remaining and the look of the game, very basic. These set aside, with family or friends, it seems to me to be a must-have !

RATING: 5
While the game was fine, I also found it unexciting. The description of a game "that will have you shouting as your cards are sent down the drain" makes it seem like it's going to be some rambunctious, action packed game. While the game is quick, it just didn't have that feel.

I'd certainly not turn down a game, as it's super fast and simple, but I also wouldn't be overly excited about it.

Light filler - though there might be more strategy than first meets the eye? The endgame is supremely unsatisfying, but a FF variant might help: "If one is forced to discard the final play, one turns it over - then draws as many cards as are turned over and keeps one. So if one fails to play a final card multiple times in a row, one ends up with more choice as to the next card played."

Fuji Flush reminds me of Linko!. But it is simpler still. There are virtually no rules to it. On your turn you play a single card. Any card. That is it. This delighted my family who don’t really ‘do’ rules explanations. 

You begin with a small hand of cards. When you have played your card it beats other cards of a lower value around the table which get removed and each player affected draws a new card. And it combines with other cards of the same value around the table to potentially beat higher cards. If at the beginning of your next turn you still have your card in front of you you can throw your card without drawing. First one out of cards is the winner.

Like Linko/Abluxxen it draws the feeling that this is so simple and so clever surely it has been done before? But no, and make no mistake some of the simplest ideas are amongst the best.

Fuji Flush will be enjoyed by non-gamers and gamers alike. Whilst not quite as interesting as Linko/Abluxxen it nevertheless is one of the best simple filler card games I have played for some time. A real winner.

I'm not sure about this game.  It's an odd one where if you play a card higher than the others played it 'flushes' them, but you can also play something lower and it just sits out there.  Add to that the combining numbers mechanic and everyone in the group getting to push their cards through when and it was all a bit odd.

I'm not sure if it is that great of a card game, but it is short.

This game feels like Uno meets Trendy.

You have a hand of cards. You play a card in front of you. Everyone else with a smaller number in front of them must discard their card and draw a new one to their hand. At the beginning of your next turn if you still have that card in front of you, you can throw it away [without having to draw a replacement card]! Whoever can get rid of all of their cards first wins.

Er, so what makes this interesting: if you play the same number as anyone else, all of that same number is added together for purposes of comparing numbers (flushing other cards off the table and staying on the table). So maybe you want to play what the table is playing because it'll make it easier to get rid of your cards too. When someone gets rid of a card at the start of their turn, all other people with the same number out also get to get rid of it too. 

So. Simple filler, plays best with larger groups of people.

Cards are numbered from 2-20. As the numbers get higher the distribution gets smaller. Players are dealt a hand of 5 or 6 cards and the object is to get rid of your cards. Each turn you play one card. Any players to your right who have played a smaller number must discard and redraw. If you are able to keep your played card in front of you until your next turn, you discard and don't redraw and that's how you get rid of them. The twist is that all of the like numbers add their values together for all of the players. So if three players have all played a "2", then those players each have a value of "6". If someone plays a "5", none of them need to discard. But if someone plays a "7", all of them discard and draw. So we have a game of constant short-lived alliances in the hopes that your low-value cards can actually be removed rather than cycled. 

Yes, there is a lot of luck. It is a filler game after all. But the fun of trying to keep your cards alive for a round and jawing with the others to join you rather than beat you makes this super-casual and fun. If you keep a collection of these types of filler card games on hand, you really should add this one to it.

I enjoy this game of "shedding your hand of cards" and there's some fun co-op moments where you're all trying to overpower another player's score.

Interesting premise: temporary shifting alliances, in a 10 minute filler? YES! However, gameplay is AWFUL, and defies the definition of "game". The arc is terrible, and drags on forever near the end, until somebody draws a high card to replace their last. Randomness factor is too damn high, and decisions are either baseless guesswork or mindless grind. It manages to make 10 minutes seem like 30.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Don't love it or hate it. Can see it filling a space as you wait for everyone to arrive for a game night or to close out a game night. I'm not sure how much control or decision space exists in the game, particularly as you get down to just a card or two.

As is, this game is a 5. With slight modification (I played that you start with 6 cards and only have to get down to 1 to win, which makes things not just complete luck on your last played card) this game is a 6/10. While still having a large amount of luck there is just something strangely addicting of trying to get other players to cooperate to get a chain of cards going  such that even your low numbers (which there are more of) can add up to beat the higher numbers. It's hard to explain, but people got so into it they were excitedly chanting which number they wanted the next person to play.

There always seems to be filler games that dethrone other filler games.  No Thanks and For Sale were king for a while, and Love Letter was probably in there somewhere.  Fuji Flush is definitely where I want to be right now for fillers, especially since it plays best with its upper limit of seven of eight players.  Simple and highly entertaining.

Je n'avais pas vraiment accroché à "cornichons", et ce jeu (qui n'est pas une suite, malgré une boîte qui y ressemble fortement) ne m'a qu'à peine plus convaincu. C'est certes original, mais c'est surtout très chaotique et on ne gagnera jamais "car on a bien joué".

A fun and different kind of card game.  Pleasantly puzzly with a good amount of luck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game is a very simple game where if you play a card you are hoping that players don't play higher cards than you where you have to discard and take a new card.  If another player plays the same card, it strengthens the card, doubling or tripling the strength.  In order for it it flush, you have to play another card greater than the strength.

The game is ok, but if you pull a log of low cards, you cannot win.  I found it it a little boring and had a lot of similarities to Linko.  I would rather play Linko.

Fuji Flush is about moments: the moment when "team 2" takes the round, or when a 20 knocks out a player's 19 right before he's going to win the game. Everyone gets into those moments, and that's a lot of fun.

It's maybe a hair more random than I expected, although I knew it was a light game. I didn't have to think a whole lot during our first two plays, but I also felt like I was thinking just the right amount to a) keep it from being un-thinky and therefore unfun, and b) match the 15-minute play time.

I can see this being very different with 8 players (we played with 5), and I love that it scales that high -- putting it into party game territory.

Great filler, though I usually want to play 3 or so hands for a "best of X" approach. It's got a pretty basic strategy (save all your big cards to the end), but that strategy doesn't always work because of the way that card values add together

Vous jouez à tour de rôle dans le sens horaire, jusqu’à ce que la partie se termine. À votre tour, jouez une carte de votre main en la posant devant vous. Vous pouvez jouer une carte de n’importe quelle valeur. Puis le joueur suivant (situé à votre gauche) joue une carte de sa main, et ainsi de suite.

Si vous jouez une carte dont la valeur est supérieure à une ou plusieurs cartes jouées par les autres joueurs, vous battez ces cartes. Tous les joueurs ayant joué une carte avec une valeur inférieure doivent « nettoyer » devant eux en mettant cette carte dans la Défausse, puis piocher une carte de remplacement et l’ajouter à leur main. Toutes les cartes dont la valeur est égale ou supérieure à la vôtre ne sont pas affectées et restent devant les joueurs.

Si c’est de nouveau à vous de jouer et que votre carte est toujours devant vous, car aucune carte avec une valeur supérieure n’a été jouée, vous avez su « imposer votre carte ». Vous la mettez dans la Défausse SANS piocher de carte de remplacement. Vous avez donc une carte de moins dans votre main et êtes un peu plus proche de la victoire ! Ensuite, jouez une des cartes encore dans votre main.
Unissez vos Forces

Si vous jouez une carte de la même valeur qu’une carte déjà présente devant un ou plusieurs de vos compagnons de jeu, additionnez toutes ces valeurs pour leur donner une valeur combinée supérieure. Si cette valeur combinée est supérieure à la valeur des cartes d’un ou plusieurs autres joueurs, vous les battez. Ils doivent alors « nettoyer » devant eux et piocher une carte de remplacement. Si la valeur combinée est battue par les cartes des autres joueurs, vous devez « nettoyer » devant vous. Vous ne devez jamais communiquer d’informations sur les cartes de votre main aux autres joueurs.

Si un autre joueur joue une carte de valeur égale à la valeur combinée de vos cartes, la valeur de sa carte ne s’additionne pas !

La Victoire
Si vous avez pu « imposer votre dernière carte », vous n’avez donc PLUS de cartes devant vous NI dans votre main, vous remportez aussitôt la partie. Vous pouvez gagner pendant le tour d’un autre joueur, ou partager la victoire à plusieurs si vous jouez les mêmes valeurs et que « vous vous imposez » ensemble.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Fuji Flush was an okay game, my main question is how many filler card games do we need? Granted if the game was exceptional I'd happily play and seek out a copy, but as it stands I found Fuji Flush outstayed it's welcome and dragged out until someone finally got the right card to go out. I never really felt like I could really influence the game through clever play. For a large crowd I still think [thing=432][/thing] reigns supreme.[/i]

RATING: 6
A simple enough game. Play a card and hope no one plays a higher card by the end of the round. If they don't, your hand size is reduced by 1, and the first player to get their hand size to 0 wins the game. I liked the twist that cards of the same value played by previous players add their values together, allowing the formation of single round alliances to each get rid of a card (if the total value isn't trumped by the time it gets round). It feels much like Trendy in that respect. The obvious strategy is to draw and keep the highest possible value cards, and draw cards that match what other players are about to play. Oh, and ally with players who aren't in a winning position. This mass of luck means the game can flounder into a dire bog if players are looking for something more meaningful, or it can be a noisy, fun, cheering/groaning affair if players add some passion and spicy vindictiveness to their cardplay. It's a vehicle upon which you must make your own fun, but at least it offers the means to do so.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
You play a card in front of you and hope it makes it around the table without anyone playing a higher value card. Low cards are more common and if others play the same card as an opponent they add up so you join together, but when you are down to a few cards don't expect others to help out, so save a big card to end with. Yes there s a lot of luck but one of those simple and fun games that gets a lot of laughs and is best with more players.

Casual shedding game of playing a card to have people discard their played cards and redraw or to go under or match and make a higher number.  It's a quick and easier shedding gave over Tichu/Gang of Four/Haggis.  There is more strategy in this over President.  Game seemed a little generic so that I'd never have a problem playing, however it didn't excite me.

Fuji Flush is an odd little card game which plays a bit like Abluxxen-lite, but with some added temporary-alliance dynamics. It takes up to 8 and in this case the more is the merrier.

Nov 2016: A conduit for trash talk. The trash talk is more pronounced as in one turn you're begging for players to help you, then the next turn after, you're telling them to fuck off. Wonderful and refreshing.

I highly recommend this game.

This game only rates this high in my book because it is short.  But it is almost pure luck.  The key to winning is to be dealt high cards.  There is an attempt to make the low cards good by letting them add together, but that is still too weak and leaves the very weak.  The real strategy is to not draw low cards, but given the card distribution it is quite likely that someone at the table will do nothing but that.

I really like this game until we hit endgame. Once people were down to one card, it just  became a random bash the leader game with little or no choices.

In sum: very clever game with a very poor endgame.

[2F-Spiele 16 Edition] {Abstract; take-that; optimal 6-8p}  Fuji Flush is a weird shedding filler for a large group of players, similar to Escalation!  Fast and fun.  The final card of a player is absolutely exciting and luck dependent :P  Good work from Friedemann Friese again.

This game is so fast and dynamic.  Cards come and go all the time.  Joining force is clever, which allows players to discard cards faster!

The card illustration is so abstract in current gaming standards.  I wish the publisher made better illustration.

There isn't that much here as a game - play your low cards early, try and build up a hand of higher cards, go for the win, but still there's a lot of fun created by the game with players trying to prevent each other from taking that elusive victory, and for that reason the game just works and generates both laughter and tension.

RATING: 7
tl;dr: pretty effective

This is one of those typical simple colored-number-card games of which you can find a million. But it's also stupidly effective. It reminded me a bit of [thing=153065][/thing]. What cards to you play when to block the other players? But in this game you can work use what other players have played to be more effective while also letting the other players profit with you. So it's a game of give and take.
Sure, there is a big luck factor. If you get all the high cards, you will probably win. But still: a good amount of fun!

RATING: 4.4
Much better at a full count of 8 players, as opposed to 5 (especially when everyone's playing it as a filler instead of serious business). My main problem is with the endgame, where when you're on your last card you're basically like "I play this, does it work? I play this, does it work?" and maybe you win, even if you were in the lead originally. I might try with the following variant:

On your turn, if you only have one card in hand, you may only play it if it joins a group. Otherwise, you may choose to discard it immediately and draw a new card.

This introduces a small decision point where, if you don't immediately see a group to join, you have to decide whether you want to hold on to your current card in hopes that someone plays it (and it will win), or you want to try to top-deck something better. Maybe it works.

When you get down to your last card, your only choice is to play it, so it really comes down to luck whether you can win or not.

Quick filler. High cards kick out lower ones. 1st to empty their hand wins.

It's almost like I played with SJacobsen159, based on his comment:
I also played my first game with seven players and found the end game to be weak. The main gameplay is interesting, with shifting alliances where players can play lower cards collectively to try to overtake players with higher cards. Once a player gets down to one card, though, it's mostly random as to whether or not they'll be able to hang on for the victory.

We reasoned that maybe in future games you should hold a certain card, probably a really high card, in order to try to pull off the win. But if that fails, you have to just keep drawing and playing a random card until the game ends.

Still want to see how it plays out with fewer players. It seems like five might be the sweet spot here, as you can still have some good alliances but the game won't take as long.

Will rate after more plays.

Update: Played a few more times and I still don't know exactly what to think. On one hand, it's an incredibly light game that you can play with a big group and just talk while you play. A beer-and-pretzels game some might call it. Good for a starter game while you figure out what else to play. But that end-game just doesn't feel right and is anti-climactic. I'll be keeping for now but not sure if it will be a keeper in the long run. I would like to see the whole teaming up aspect implemented into a better game at some point.

Great card game.  It operates on such simple and clever mechanics, it makes you wonder how another game like this hasn't been designed already.

Although it isn't the best game I have (or even the most fun), it's just so versatile. It works well at different player counts and it's easy to explain. I will keep this in my collection.

This is a great, simple, fast, and a lot of fun card game. It has a unique mechanic that rewards cooperation among the players, and rewards even more a good back stabbing. A lot of fun. It has randomness but with 15 min to complete a game ... this actually is desirable since it leads to all kind of interesting situations.

For 3 players it is boring. No fun at all. Won´t play this again. Tom Vasel was right about this one. Try Red7 instead (is awesome).

** Must play with 5 or more IMO.   Works great with 8 ad non gamers.  Someone called it advanced Uno and that might be fair in a sense.  I like the alliance factor when trying to get your # to be a winner over other players.

Good, fun, a loud card game. The more players the better. It can be a little frustrating if you only get low cards, but that's true of most card games.

5 Stars for the 3-player game, would probably be a lot better with 5 or more
Update: works way better with 6, but I'm not sure there are real choices in this game - will have to play some more

A fun little party game that's very easy to teach.

It's kind a weird one because I love the strategy and team work that can happen, but the end game really tends to fall flat. Usually just comes down everyone having one card and just playing and drawing.

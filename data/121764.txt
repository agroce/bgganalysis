It's amazing how small things comes with a big surprise.

This game is simple, fast, and family friendly, but yet full of simple decisions that makes it very fun in a small package.

This is my surprise of 2012. And must be considered one of the best games ever that I have played in recent years.

Those that hate this game is probably playing with the wrong group of people. With the right group of friends, this game just shines.

Took me ages to get this to the table as when ever I picked up the rules I was just to tired to make sense of what is not actually that complex at all.  This is Rummy with special powers and a little bit of tableau building.  Plays very quick and there is tension in do you try to hold off for a big score or just play quick....More than in the mystery rummy variants there is a lot of luck here but there are interesting decisions too and unlike say Jaipur which is mainly about avoiding making bad decisions and punishing your opponents mistakes there feels like there are lots of positive choices here.  Light but fun.  After quite a few plays there are two significant critisisms though - with 2 the game finishes a touch too often on the 3rd turn of the first player as with the scoring as is there is too much incentive for a rush victory, reducing or eliminating the penalty points gets round this.  With 3 that is not an issue but really the game can finish a turn or two early with just one deck.  So we have a game that doesnt quite work perfectly without house rules with 2 and that doesnt quite need but is benefited by having a second deck with 3.  As there are still cheap copies floating around its not a big problem and this game is a lot of fun.

:d10-2::d10-3:
I'm not sure how I feel about this after one play (three hands). Rummy alone never interested me enough to be anything other than a light travel game, and Plato 3000 doesn't depart too far from the standard rules of rummy. Yes, the special abilities add an extra layer of planning, but does it add more depth? I'm not so sure. The interesting decisions seem to be just as calculable, and the balance of luck to skill seems to be comparable.

A different take on the Mystery Rummy idea. This should only really be played with two, but I have since learned that most of these games are that way. Games can be played very quickly. If you are looking for a different sort of Rummy, this one has a hip theme to go along with it.

It fits easily into a coat pocket, which is a HUGE perk, so this may become our favorite "throw it in a purse, play it in a bar" game when on the go.  I also think this can be a good gateway to meatier card games to play with non-gamers who are familiar with Gin Rummy.  Its Rummy, with a light engine/tableau aspect.  Recommended for what it is.

Excellent rummy-style game. Only played with 2. Plays quite quickly. Not as challenging as say, Jack the Ripper or Wyatt Earp - but still quite fun. Easy to teach, and no setup (like Wyatt Earp) - just shuffle, deal, play!

First few times we missed the rule that states you can only meld once a turn. Games were hyper-fast until we started playing correctly. Game has slowed down a touch, and isn't as random with the one-meld-a-turn rule. But we can still play an entire match to 100pts in under 30 min.

This game came free with my reprint of Glory to Rome and I must say, I'm glad it did. (It's seen more plays to date). Having enjoyed quite a few games of Rummy with my brother in the past, this game brings a few delightful twists to the game. I really love the card art and its nice to have another quick, simple card game in the collection. Having read more about this game has sparked an interest in other Rummy variants and now I'm hoping to seek out the Jack the Ripper and/or Jekyll and Hyde versions.

I'm very keen on Plato 3000. It's a simple Rummy variant that adds just enough to make it interesting. There's a reason you don't still play Rummy, despite it being a solid card game - Plato 3000 adds variable powers to your sets, which takes the original into the realms of gamer's game without making it too confusing for a non-gamer. And it packs into a normal card-deck sized box, so is great for travel and I'm sure will be pretty cheap (mine was a freebie in the Glory to Rome: Black Box debacle). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game rocks! It's like Gin Rummy meets San Juan. Rummy already has great tactical game play and the added tactics of multiple discards along with the different strategic paths with jobs put this game squarely in a meaty position considering the length of the game. If you want a meaty micrograme/filler then this is a good one (and cheap at that)

Best with 3 and good with 2-4

Back when this game was Utopian Rummy, a free print and play game, I played this over 100 times with my wife and friends. I loved the game, and talked to the designer about pitching it to Cambridge Games Factory. It all worked out over time, and CGF developed Plato 3000 by shifting and changing Utopian Rummy into an even better game.

Plato 3000 is beautiful. It's quick, but not too short (about 30 minutes with 2 players). It's an easy-to-get-into-game, but with enough going on to keep serious gamers (me) from getting bored. This is simply a wonderful game to play with 2-4 players, I really can't recommend it enough.

Although we had heard some good reviews of [thing=42057][/thing], we hadn't played it until we received a copy of the newer version of [thing=121764][/thing] from the recent [thing=19857][/thing] kickstarter.  When we were first getting started in the hobby, we had enjoyed [thing=106][/thing], so this looked like a game that could fit the same mold.

The theme of the game was a little odd.  I actually prefer the art deco style of [thing=42057][/thing].  Still, that was a minor nitpick.  The gameplay was a solid variation of rummy---if you're familiar with the Mystery Rummy series, this plays similarly.  The new idea here is taking the rummy mechanism and combining it with ideas from newer tableau-building games.  Once you lay down a meld, those melds give you special actions that you can use.  Since we enjoyed both types of games, this should have been a no-brainer.  

However, the game fell a little flat.  There was nothing particularly wrong with it, as it was a pleasant experience, but it just felt slightly boring.  In terms of the rummy mechanism, we felt that [thing=106][/thing] felt like a tighter game (and to be honest, we've even started to tire of that game as well).  In theory, the special actions should have spiced up the games like the gavel cards in the Mystery Rummy series, but in practice the special actions didn't really feel that special or unique.  As a result, the game misses out on what we love about tableau-building games---the large number of combinations available.  As a result, each round of [thing=121764][/thing] felt very same-y.  While I can appreciate the game, there really wasn't anything to keep us hooked.

Extremely disappointed with this one. I was really looking forward to playing a simple, small rummy game with nice artwork. Unfortunately the game failed miserably to live up to expectations.

With so many ways to pick up, acquire and discard cards it's just too easy to go out. Rounds can be incredibly short - often in a three player game one or two players only get two turns. Other groups might hold back jobs and try and time their melds carefully, but with the people I play with the start player has all the incentive to get an extra turn, put everything they can down and catch the other players out with negative points in their hand. The other players seeing this tend to try and empty their hand as fast as they can. Luck plays too great a roll in such situations whether players get positive or negative points. I've no doubt that if we were more patient and timed out melds cleverly it would result in a better game, but as I said, the incentive is there for the start player to play hard and fast. 

In addition to which the actual choices players make are too obvious to keep the game interesting. There's no shortage of other vastly superior Rummy titles to choose from (like Wyatt Earp or any Mystery Rummy title), that do it much, much... much better. This was a real waste of perfectly good gaming time. Admittedly I haven't tried this with four players in teams. It's doubtful I ever will though. I like the artwork.

Yes, it's Rummy, but the cards only go to 8, there are no straights, and you can add onto anything anyone else played. Which makes every game very short. Each card number has a special ability, but they're all kind of the same in the end. Not very interesting.

RATING: 6
Plato 3000 is structured similarly to the Mystery Rummy series, but a lot less complex. The twist in this game is that each meld grants players abilities, and can form simple combos with different melds or cards. 

Rounds go by dizzyingly fast - maybe a bit [i]too[/i] fast, as it is easy to go out in this game. A player takes an average of 4 turns in a 2P game, and just as good combos start to form, someone goes out and it's all over. It is a little problematic if you start off with a poor hand, as it is difficult to even the odds with such limited time. However, the speed of the game also makes it crucial for players to make good decisions on which cards to keep and which to discard. 4P games are chaotic as the deck runs out before players know what hit them.

Great art and graphic design. I can see this as a gateway to more complex rummy games, or for those who have an itch for rummy games, but are tight on time.

This is a good rummy variant game with interesting and challenging decisions at every turn.  A keeper.

A rummy-like game in which the melds you make provide you with special abilities that help you to finish the hand more favorably. The number of meld types is fairly low, so there isn't a lot of room for clever combinations of these special abilities, and you can't plan ahead to try for particular combinations of powers. All in all, it ends up feeling very dull, like there was a lot of cool potential wasted.

A fun, rummy set-collection game. The short playtime though makes me want maybe for something a little meatier.

[thing=121764][/thing] is a card game with lots of similarities with the Mystery Rummy series. Basically the game will be played over several rounds, and players score points at the end of each round. Points are accumulated as the rounds progress and the game will end when someone reaches 100 points, then the winner will be the player with the most points.

Depending on the number of players, players may start with a hand of 8, 9 or 10 cards. There are 2 discard piles, both of which are kept face up – a Research Discard and a Scrap Discard, and these are meant to be put in different orientations to help remember which is which, and we tried, but some confusion issued from this from time to time, but by the third round we were doing just fine, and in the end but we just went left and right of the draw deck.

Then, at the start of the player's turn, he can choose to [b]research[/b] (take 2 cards from the draw deck, keeps one and discard the other in the Research discard pile) or [b]excavate[/b] (take the top card of one of the discard piles). The player can then play cards: 3 of the same kind to start a Job, any number of cards to follow a Job already started, and/or use a Theory card, applying its effects, but only one of these can be played in the turn. At the end of the turn, the player [u]must[/u] discard one card to the Scrap pile - it is not allowed to use all the cards and not have at least one to discard to the Scrap pile.

The turns go like this until only one player still have cards in hand (considering a 3 players game) or 2, if playing with 4; or until the draw deck is depleted. Players than score accordingly to the cards played. In the next round the player with the lowest score will start.

[thing=121764][/thing], as most card games, has plenty of luck built in. Not only there are better cards (Metaphysics is much better than Physics, for exemple) in the pile, the game can snowball to someone: jobs have powers, most of them regarding getting more cards and gaining points. The more jobs, the more points you win and the best you become to gain more points. And, of course, the contrary is true: the worst you are, the biggest the gap will become as the turns pass.

Also, most of the decisions in the game are obvious - most of the time you will play whatever you can, only pondering about this when you are close to be out of cards. Usually the "hardest" decision in the turns will be which card to discard, both at the beginning and at the end of the turn, since the other players can take them - this part is mostly similar to that in [thing=140934][/thing], but this is deeper and a far superior game.

The art in [thing=121764][/thing] is, for me, awesome, and it was its biggest selling point - I just love the quirk art style. And there is a neat easter egg: all the Merchant cards have different announcement signs above the vehicle, and all the texts have something to do with games. Just a great little thing!

Overall, [thing=121764][/thing] is an OK game, but little to make it a great option in todays market. There is just several better card games around, for instance, the aforementioned [thing=140934][/thing] is superior in every way (just not in the art, but in [thing=140934][/thing] is also very well done) - but since I got it as a present, there is little to complain; after playing, I would not buy it, nor do I recommend you to. Still, [thing=121764][/thing] is easy to explain and to play, and it doesn't take long to finish - I thought it would, but most of the rounds players will do 20-30 points, and our game finished in four rounds. With these good things, it might find a way to fit in your collection.

Rummy with abilities. I like this quite a bit overall. If you like rummy, you will like this game.

That being said, the abilities aren't as dynamic as they could be.

A very solid Mystery Rummy type game. Draw a card, meld groups of 3, add on to melds, discard until someone "goes out". What's cool is that each type of card provides a unique benefit, such as drawing extra cards, keeping extra, removing cards from play, scoring extra points, and so forth.

I've only played Mystery Rummy Jack the Ripper, but I enjoyed this one more than it. Even though I suck royally at it, my wife just kills me every time.

A rummy variant that really draws players in with the beautiful art. Scores can be very swingy, and flow of play is a bit confusing at first, but at the end of our first round everything really clicked.

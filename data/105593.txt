I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

The core mechanic of Mogel Motte is a simplified and even more boring version of UNO. There are no colors anymore, just numbers. Yet that doesn't really matter, because cheating without getting caught is what this game is really about... and this actually delivers some fun and some thrill. You have to wait for the right moment to drop your cards or hide them in you pocket. That can be quite exciting.

Yet I don't find the game to be that interesting. It tries spicing things up with some take-that cards, which is a mechanism I don't really care for, and a speed element... but neither of those things really make this title stand out of the crowd.

Ultimately Mogel Motte is not bad, but - at least for me - it's an easily forgettable card game. Still playable every now and then, but I wouldn't go out of my way to bring it to the table.

RATING: 7.9
An amusing card game which actively encourages the players to cheat if possible to score the least amount of points in a round; but the presence of a Guard Bug card/player serves to keep that in check. There is also a dexterity component with several of the bug Action Cards, and I love the Cheating Moth card itself. Just a lot of wild fun, but the chaos is somewhat contained by all the balances and restrictions. Artwork is also cute and excellent for the tone of play, a sibling to Cockroach Poker.

RATING: 7
Mogel Motte is a simple and silly game. It is the type of game that works great with non-gamers but also works brilliantly as a filler for gamers. What makes this game so successful is the tension that it creates. For the cheating players, you are always looking for opportunities to cheat and quickly become paranoid that the guard-player is watching you. For the guard-player, you see players hands are shrinking faster than they should and become paranoid that others are getting away with murder... and you should be because mechanically, the game provides numerous ways for players to cheat (Using a mosquito card as a distraction, stacking 2 cards into the discard, etc). And together, you get a VERY engaging and VERY tense game for all players.

Now, you would think that this game would be super easy for a vigilant/competitive guard player. But when I am the guard player, I take this game seriously... and probably only catch a 1/5 of the cheating. And that's because the game gives players a lot of freedom on how they can cheat and mechanically facilitates the cheating. 

For a party-esque game, 3-5 players isn't the most inclusive player count; But it plays 3-player fairly well and 4-5 very well. Obviously, this isn't going to be everyone's cup-of-tea and isn't going to be the focal point of a gaming event. But for what this game is... it is brilliant.

Highly interactive and luck prone, where you're trying to get rid of your hand of cards normally by playing one on your turn (if you have one that's playable at +1 or -1 of the number previously played, otherwise you draw a card) while all the while trying to cheat discarding the rest without the others noticing. Nothing to brag about in this filler. that didn't draw me in (artwork is horrible, play is ok).

RATING: 6
A simple filler that doesn’t shine, Mogel Motte’s manages to stand among most games just because it allows cheating and even states this in its rulebook: but this way cheating is no longer «cheating» as usually intended but a way to play the game by the rules, thus the cheating itself is stripped of its meaning.

Without all the cheating though - which makes all the fun - Mogel Motte would be one of the flattest cardgames I’ve ever played.

Can be hilarious with the right crowd but more often than not it falls like a dead moth from the sky.  The problem is it it's fragile and lacks direction in regards to the permissible cheating.  It's chaotic but desperately needs at least a modicum of additional structure.  

It's also not nearly as much fun playing the Guard Bug as the cheater.

Este juego me recuerda un poco al clásico juego llamado "Uno". Es divertido y funciona mejor con mucha gente aunque la estrategia de este juego más bien está en ver cuándo te conviene tratar de esconder tus cartas. Para estar jugando a ver cuándo se distrae alguien (la Chinche Guardián en este juego) no es necesario un juego de mesa.

Unlike Kakerlakenpoker Royal, Mogel Motte is an excellent game. I absolutely love how you need to CHEAT in order to win! Throw away your cards under the table, hide them in your sleeves etc. without the person playing as the guard bug notices you! Except for this awesome mechanism and gameplay where you’re encouraged to cheat, the game itself is rather basic as you simply play a legal card on top of another card (a 4 on a 3 or 5, a 1 on a 2 or 5 etc). But man, the way that the winner is the first one to get rid of his/her cards mean that you have to cheat, and that’s brilliant and very entertaining. 

Also, there are 5 special types of cards included which all do various things when playing them; everybody hates to see the ant card as they need to take an extra card, the spider is so annoying if you’re picked on as you get a card, the mosquito is a fantastic idea, and those moth cards are so annoying to have - as the only way to get rid of those is by cheating (unless you’re the guard bug)! The mosquito is a great idea as it adds a speed element to the game; you have to constantly be aware as if you’re the slowest you will get a penalty! The cockroach also adds a speed element, although that card is less fun than the mosquito. All in all I highly recommend Mogel Motte – it plays very quickly, it doesn’t take up much space on the shelf, it’s cheap, it supports a fair amount of players and most of all it’s fun!

Brilliant game. Fun, fast, and easy to remember rules. The best kind of filler.

The only downside to this game is it can be boring if you are the Guard and no one is cheating. Otherwise, it's a blast to play.

Also, don't forget to wear a long sleeve shirt! I find tucking cards in your sleeve to be the most effective means of cheating,

2014-05-06 : The sign of a good party game is when after it's done everyone at the table wants to go again. This is such a game. That you have to cheat in order to win is the twist that delights gamers. One final thing : There is no reason the max player count is 5. We played it with 8, giving each player 1 less card and it still worked fine.
Funnily enough last night we played it with 4 and it fell flat. It's starting to look like the official 3-5 player range is way off mark.

The card game itself is flat out boring. What makes it (more) interesting is an unusual reversal on normal gaming procedure, namely that it's okay to cheat. With some cards it is in fact required to do so, provided you're playing to win. Arguably, the cheating is the game. There isn't much else. Cheating Moth is a silly filler in the correct setting (unfortunately, that includes not only the players but also clothes and seating among other things). There is, however, a very high chance of failure. Probably not so bad with kids.

Un juego MUY divertido, cambia por completo lo que uno está acostumbrado a hacer y uno no sabe con qué se puede encontrar al jugar con nuevas personas. Lo malo de este juego es que jugando con las mismas personas se vuelve repetitivo porque uno ya sabe lo que harán los demás.
Jugando con personas tímidas no funciona porque les cuesta mucho hacer trampa y casi siempre ganará el chinche.
Otro punto en contra es que las cartas se deterioran muy rápido debido a lo que hay que hacer con ellas.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (April 2015)

WOW what a surprise, the game is uber fun. Mogel Motte is very simple, but the cheating rules make for a good game. At first, almost no one cheated, but from the second game onward, everyone was cheating like crazy. My SO was throwing her cards in the floor and a passerby thought she dropped the cards by mistake, he picked them up and gave them back to her, it was HILARIOUS. Love that the rules allow for cheating (very novel), if you don’t you cannot win :D.

The game can be explained under 2 minutes and the playtime is around 15 minutes. I also dig the art. 
I played a friend´s copy. On my own, I would have never picked up this game because the cards suffer a lot, even with sleeves. Now I’m thinking about buying the game, if I do I would have to laminate the cards.

Bottom line, Mogel Motte is a great party/family game, lots of laughs and fun. I feel weird rating it a 7.0, but I had so much fun playing it I don’t see any way around it. Perhaps with more plays the rating will go down, we will see. Some friends really hated the game, try it before you buy it.

One of 2011`s favorites.

Now you certainly couldn't play it all the time, but every once in a while this is a great one to pull out for some laughs.  It is quite difficult to cheat and the way the cards work, you are forced to cheat as often as you can.  It really is cleverly assembled, and taken in the right spirit, it's a ton of fun.

I'd rather be spending my time trying to get rid of actual live bugs.

This game is essentially Uno but with the caveat that you can cheat.  It took a bad game and made it a bad game that let's you throw your cards on the floor instead of playing them.  The best thing this had going for it was that it was short.  We played 2 rounds.  It was the worst 15 minutes of recent memory.

A really light card game that reminds me of some traditional card games I have played in my youth. I guess I'm a bit too honest and/or serious as I don't really like to "cheat" even if it is allowed.

台譯作弊飛蛾，是個必須用盡手段(包含作弊)將手牌全部弄掉的遊戲。特殊卡片出現玩家都必須做對應的事情(比如心臟病、給禮物)讓遊戲比較不會無聊。警衛的立意很棒但必須要所有的玩家都約束好比較不會過於弱勢。輕鬆小品支援二到五人，穿插在大遊戲之間是個不錯的選擇。玩完以後記得仔細打掃。

A hilarious card game, where cheating is not only allowed, but encouraged!  The rules are simple and the art work is great.  It plays fast and serves as a great filler between games.

A game where cheating is encouraged..... in fact if you don't cheat you WILL lose! Blink and you find people who were sitting with a hand of cards when you closed your eyes now have only one left!!!!
Tremendous FUN game.

Silly, potentially stressful, potentially uproarious social card game that tests your observational skills. Echoes of Uno and Egyptian Rat Fuck, but the encouraged cheating aspect is entirely novel. I suck as guard bug... my opponents get away with murder.

Not quite as riotous as Kakerlakensuppe/salat but reasonably hilarious in its own unique way.

Needs honest, trustworthy players for the cheating element to function properly.

Uno where you can win by dropping your cards on the floor. Curiously more fun than it sounds.

The catch here is that the skill in this game is principally sleight of hand. A card game in which sleight of hand is important probably ought to be more fun than this but it felt a little stale and not as challenging as it should be.

For a silly game about pocketing cards, I expect to less memorization of card powers.  Also, the silliness about pocketing cards is hard to formalize and doesn't really compel me.  I appreciate the attempt to have a very novel mechanic, but it didn't work for me.

A game of discarting your hand, with some cards with special abilities. It is allowed to cheat in the game, hidding your cards to empty more quickly your hand, but if the guardian catches a player, he will be penalized.

The cheating game. 

Basically it's a game where you try to get rid of your hand of cards the fastest. You can play cards on the central pile according to simplest of rules. Some of them can be special cards which cause (often welcome) mayhem and havoc. Or you can just throw cards on the floor or hide them somewhere. Just one at a time though. And if the guard catches you, you take the cars(s) back and become a guard. 

Quite a difficult skill to master for me - I did get better, but unlike games of lying here you really need some dexterity skills, not just psychology. I might be too unpractical for that. It is fun though. 

We tried it once with those kind of teenagers that hide weed from their teachers, parents and police (in that order, it's decriminalised). There skills were off the charts. You could stare them in the hand of cards while cards were disappearing (you found that afterwards). They helped one another cheat without communicating, they put their clothes on the floor, so we wouldn't hear the cards fall. And they were immensely happy as their skills and ingenuity could be used for "good". Ha!

A great game if you have people into this sort of thing. Definitely one for teachers and parents. 
Not sure it's my thing. Yet. But good one.

Fun variation of Crazy Eights with art in the style of Kakerlakenpoker. All players but one are allowed to cheat unless the one catches them in the act, in which case the cheater is penalized and becomes the new watchdog. With the right group, in the right mood, it's lots of fun.

[Drei Magier Spiele 2011 edition] {Animal; shedding, cheating; optimal 4-5p} This is a fun filler, with the special "forced" cheating element with take-that and chaotic plays.  Nonetheless, nothing really special.

The card illustration is interesting and the cards are colorful.   However, I still think there are too many action cards in the game, and make players confusing.

Oops, my rulebook about the Ant is wrong.  It should mean drawing from the draw pile, rather than the discard pile.

A good after dinner game with our kids, fun end of the night game with the game group and superb to introduce to the kids of friends.
Like One Night Ultimate Werewolf it also benefits from the carry-over from previous games as you look for the same "cheats" and tells and bluffs; just great fun.

Rating for the game with the rules as written. We were all glad when finally after a long time one hand was finished, and nobody wanted to play another one.

According to a thread here, the written rules for the ant card are wrong. Likely the game gets better when you play with that change. Likely won't play another game to try it.

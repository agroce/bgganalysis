Another great escape room experience.  I rate it just below Cabin because it had more 'wow' moments (possibly because I played it first), but this is also very good.  Favourite puzzles : the flags and making the numbers from...(won't spoil it for you).

Also, fast volle Punktzahl mit 61 Minuten und vier Spielern. Die "schlechte" Wertung liegt also nicht in einem Scheitern oder so begründet. :-)

Kritik: 
- Alphaspielerproblem: man kann kaum wirklich kooperativ-simultan arbeiten; die meisten Lösungen wurden im Alleingang entworfen und dann mit der Gruppe geprüft
- kein Spannungsbogen: Rätsel => Rätsel => Rätsel => Rätsel => vorbei. Achse. 
- Persönlich hatte ich auch nicht das Gefühl, genuin etwas geleistet zu haben, aber das wurde in der Spielrunde auch deutlich anders gesehen: manche Mitspieler hätten sich direkt auf die nächste Box gestürzt, hätte eine vorgelegen. 

Fazit: Dies ist kein Spiel im engeren Sinne. Eine interessante Herausforderung für Tüftler, sehr kompetent umgesetzt, die einigen Leuten sehr viel Spaß machen und andere Leute völlig kalt lassen wird (mich).

You must solve a series of riddles and puzzles to escape from a room. Each correct solution brings you to another riddle. How fast can you escape the room? This game can be played only once, because you markup, fold, and tear the game materials.

Absolutely loved this one. A good number of clever puzzles in this one. We only needed a couple of hints during the game but were never that far off from the right solution; just needed that final little nudge. Not sure how well this would play with more than 2 players as there isn't enough going on at the same time to keep that many people occupied. Sadly can't play this one again or give it to someone else to enjoy because of the component destruction, but given the low price, it was far cheaper than going to the movies, took just about as long, and was far more enjoyable. Looking forward to the other ones in the series!

After our disappointment in the Forgotten Island, we played this title the next night. The Secret Lab put our faith back into the Exit series (we also didn't find the Pharaoh title to be that great). This one was enjoyable. The puzzles were well presented and did provide a decent simulation of an exit room. The Abandoned Cabin still has our favorite puzzle from this series, but The Secret Lab felt a bit less reliant on its use of gimmicks as compared to The Abandoned Cabin and, especially, Pharaoh's Tomb and Forgotten Island.

Another "Escape the Room" style board game. It's really just about solving a bunch of puzzles and that's about it. The story is thin. I didn't like this as much as the other Escape the Room games we've played (from ThinkFun), but it may have been slightly tougher to solve. It's a one play game which is disappointing (ThinkFun's games can be reassembled and played again by others). I'd play more of these, but I don't feel like I need to do that.

Okay experience, we played it directly after going to a real live escape room. So we were in the right mood for it. It was fun, but also a bit boring. Additionally the game lacked highlights.

RATING: 8
(SPOILER FREE) I liked the abandoned cabin a bit better but this was a lot of fun as well. Good puzzles with some interesting solutions.

If you like other escape the room type games these are very good and are also fairly small and easy to take somewhere. You will do some cutting and writing, and so you can't use this one more than once. Also I think more than 4 people would probably struggle to keep everyone involved. 

Long story short, if you like these kinds of games, you'll probably like this one too.

We had a better time with this one than with Pharaoh, maybe because it's a little easier and we were familiar with the format. Nothing too out of the ordinary, and we definitely were overthinking some puzzles on many occasions. Also didn't have some "meta" elements like pharaoh did and the path forward was more obvious. Definitely a solid way to spend a few hours. Also, if you're careful, totally destroying the components isn't as entirely necessary for this one, so that's a plus for letting other groups have a go at it.

By a slight misjudgement in solving the first clue we somehow got the wrong answer code and ended up going straight to the last clue. We therefore got really frustrated with this and abandoned it. 
Later, I went through it again to find out what went wrong. I still found some of the clues illogical or badly formulated. (e.g. the PH strips clue.)
Nevertheless, we still have Abandoned Cabin and Pharaoh's Tomb to play.

RATING: 7
Out of the initial three EXIT: The Game scenarios, this was my least favorite. They do a very good job of imitating the Escape Room experience. After escaping from an Escape Room I usually have a state of euphoria, which these games managed to duplicate very well. The theme of this one was not as fun as the other two and this one had some difficult puzzles for us. I should note that this was the first one we played and so we weren't sure what to expect, which may have added to the difficulty. Usually you can only solve one puzzle at a time though so I think having 6 players is quite ambitious and believe even 4 might be pushing it. We completed all of them with just two, admittedly not getting very good scores. I do look forward to more in the series mostly because the price is very affordable, even though you typically end up destroying the game through the process of playing it.

RATING: N/A
Note: Rated an 8, but I just decided to rate one of them rather than every game in the entire series.

This provided a truly excellent escape room-type experience that was really engaging and fun throughout. This particular set seemed the weakest of the original 3 to me, with less "wow!" moments. A little less clever than the other two, but still fun.

Lots of fun puzzles, at a good level of difficulty for the gaming crowd.

As an experience, it's probably a 9 in terms of the fun I had and how much I look forward to playing other games in the series, but it feels a bit odd giving it any more than an 8 as something that's one and done after about an hour. A fun hour though!

If you're looking for a good escape room in a box, this is well worth the purchase. The price is GREAT, the puzzles are quite good, and it's a fun experience all around. Better than a real escape room? Nah. Better than the vast majority of escape rooms in a box, though - second only to the Escape Room: The Game series.

Probably my second favorite of the three.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
This one gets a low rating from me. First of all, in trying to solve it we had to use way more hints than I did when trying to solve the other one where you're escaping an Egyptian tomb. My friends and I agreed that some of the puzzles were absolutely impossible to figure out. There was no logic to coming to some of the conclusions. And we would never have gotten it without hints. And that's really no fun. Cuz you feel like a failure whenever you reach for a hint. I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who would say they didn't use any hints, but I I can't imagine what kind of super Geniuses they are. LOL!

Also, I'm sure there was a typo on one of the hints. The one that mentions lichen. The text on the riddle and the text on the clue we're completely different. And some of the chemicals weren't even listed on their periodic table. This was our most frustrating puzzle. Because there was no way to have figured out that you are supposed to ignore all the other numbers but the first four. It just seemed to make no sense. So I was very frustrated and considering this is a "play once then throw it out" game, I feel like I just threw out $15.

But of course you are a fool if you can't figure out how to play these games and keep them intact so that you can pass them on to somebody. Which is what I did.

NO SPOILERS

This was the very first "Escape Room" game I played (with my wife), and it was pretty tough... This is probably the hardest one I've tried (although it might have had an impact that we were very tired...)

Some of the riddles were very hard to crack, although we actually did end up only using two clue cards. But it took us about 1½ hours - which was three times as long as The Abandoned Cabin. Some really cool riddles in this, although I preferred the riddles in The Abandoned Cabin; but that one is actually too easy, which is why I think The Secret Lab is slightly better.

Compared to other Escape Rooms (Unlock, Escape The Room), I find this one the hardest, which is a good thing for sure. But I like Escape The Room more, as - even though the riddles aren't as involved - the whole story and mix of mental and physic exercises and challenges is overall more interesting.

RATING: 8
Components: Fun booklet and room illustrations. Other cards are functional, though plain. Puzzles fit well with the theme. As in other escape room games, it's a real problem that the components have tiny images and tiny print, making it so only one person can look at them/manipulate them at a time. In this game in particular, it seemed there was only one riddle going on at a time, meaning two of us had to sit buy while one person fidgeted with the components related to that riddle. I'm fascinated by the code disc, and how the resulting numbers are then double-authenticated using images.

Experience: Another fun escape room game, with lots of challenging puzzles, some of which stumped us enough that we looked at a clue. Most puzzles required us to put our heads together, even if to efficiently figure out which codes to input into the disc.

Of the three escape room series I've played so far, I like this system a bit less than that of Unlocked! and Escape Room: the Game. In Unlocked!, each card has fantastic art, often depicting an object to be combined with another object, which greatly enhances the theme. Escape Room: the Game is similar to Exit: the Game in that each puzzle results in a code, but the cards themselves are more like Choose Your Own Adventure narrative branches, featuring only text that tells us which other cards to take.

Thematically, too, I didn't particularly enjoy that the codes were always a combination of chemicals. It's not as much fun to mix together three colored liquids in this game as to inspect a skeleton with a magnifying glass in one of the other games.

Still, the riddle cards had some really cool stuff, including one great “aha” moment.

I'll say this - of the three Exit titles, The Secret Lab was, in my opinion, the most solidly-built.  We were able to get through it (except for one glaring part) with pure logic and made terrific pace.

However, it severely lost points with me when the game came to a screeching halt.  As explained in my comment on The Abandoned Cabin, each of these games comes with a stack of hint cards in case you get stuck, much like radioing the staff to come help you in a real room and the idea is these are supposed to help you and even feed you the solution.

[b][u]The problem is that for this one particular puzzle, we were stuck on it for 20 minutes, even after knowing the solution (star-shaped puzzle).[/b][/u]  Granted, you can just punch in the code and move along, but we had honestly figured everything out for the puzzle correctly, but the logic didn't make sense.  [u][b]Part of this is because of a horrible misprint[/b][/u] that renders the logic of the solution meaningless.  That is to say, each solution card will tell you how to think your way through the puzzle, but because of the misprint, it's extremely confusing.  Second, the hint on the actual riddle card and the explanation on the solution card don't quite click.  It does if you want to sort of explain it backwards, and we could debate this, but it's impossible for me to explain without spoiling it.  All I can say is that this one single puzzle ruined the whole experience for us.

By the time we had hit that puzzle and discussed it - which was perhaps the 7th out of 10 (I honestly can't remember) - my heart was no longer in it.  Yes, we redacted the time spent on it because it was beyond stupid, but there was a specific moment where I got up and left the table and started eating a banana because I really just stopped caring.  It just so happened that as I was peeling it, I solved the next puzzle, but there was no joy anymore and once that's gone, you're no longer experiencing the whole point of these things.

In any case, this is a huge error on behalf of Kosmos and while The Secret Lab was ultimately a great experience, that kind of taint will stay with me forever, even if they fix it ('cause there's no point for me to play it again).

RATING: 6
The Secret Lab is an enjoyable experience. We played as a family (me, wife, 12 and 13 year old). My wife and I found only a couple of the riddles challenging. Some of the riddles were too obvious and could have been made harder. We do have science backgrounds, so perhaps that helped us "exit the lab". The kids did well. We'll definitely try other games in the series. Some puzzles can be gimmicky.

I like this system, it really does give you the feeling of a room escape game in your very own home. And the price is reasonable if you think of it as cost per person for an hour of entertainment. But do keep in mind some components are destroyed during play, so you cannot replay this game, and you cannot give your copy to someone else to play. I will happily seek out new titles in this series.

An escape room in a box with a good series of puzzles.

Not bad. I did wonder at points why I wouldn't just buy a puzzle book and then give myself an hour to solve it, but it was still entertaining. I did not think it did the best job of teaching you the game, but pretty solid still. Worth at least a play.

RATING: 7
I don't think I like it more than Unlock. I think the puzzles are more involved and pure and there's more of them, but neither game made me feel satisfied when I solved them. The puzzles are simply too easy. The hints are a lot better in Exit though, especially the section where it lists all of the cards you need to solve it. 

The decoder wheel instead of an app is not as good though, because it is cumbersome and one time we got stuck because we simply read the legend incorrectly. I don't like that it's way more expensive and destructive. It didn't need to be destructive, you draw on like 3 things and cut 1 thing, why not offer replacements or transparent sheets? I thought the story and atmosphere was non-existent, which is not true for Unlock. It was weird that they had stuff that connected with real world knowledge, such as flags and the periodic table, but then they didn't let you use your knowledge of them because they straight up told you their meaning before you even got to the puzzle where they were needed.

I've never done an actual escape room, although I do love puzzles. I'm better, though, at puzzles that have a "scope" rather than puzzles where I have to figure out what needs to be solved and what it needs to be solved with.

The Exit system is a very clever way to do things, and the puzzles were challenging but fun. I like the hint system included here--the rules say if you use a hint card but it doesn't give you any new info, you don't have to count it. We often used the first hint card to set the scope of the puzzle and then were able to figure it out from there. (We felt extra special when, for some puzzles, the hints weren't necessary.) It took us MUCH longer than the advertised time on the box, but we played leisurely (and, admittedly, aren't great at this sort of thing). We bought the box in lieu of going to a movie, so even though it was one-time use, it didn't feel like a rip-off. We both agreed that we had a great time and are eager to try more of the puzzles in this series.

This feels a little like it was written by somebody who'd done a bunch of puzzles but didn't quite get what made them work. I was particularly annoyed about the use of real-world information that's then fed to the player.

Non-real example to clarify: It's as if the first half of a puzzle said "You can find Secret Code X by subtracting Queen Victoria's birth year (1819) from Marlon Brando's birth year (???)" and the second half said "Marlon Brando was born in 1924. Reverse the digits of Secret Code X and enter them on the keypad to proceed." There's a point where it seems like you might need to know some trivia to advance, but actually the game will tell you all of it before you could use it anyway. So why are Brando and Victoria there at all?

Similar to Cabin in terms of the puzzles being at a good level where there were only a few puzzles that were too easy and the hardest ones didn't take too long. And it was structured so that when you got stuck on something there was almost always something else to think about. The only reason this loses a bit over Cabin is that it didn't have anything quite as clever or unique as Cabin.

Played with 6, which is the listed upper limit, and would definitely not play another game in this series with more than 3. The size of the components and the number of puzzles available to be solved at any given time meant that for most of it at least half the people were left with nothing to do. Precisely who was stuck with nothing to do rotated, but it was always someone. I've played the Unlock games and enjoyed them much more, which may be due mainly to having played them with 3 or 4 people.

Probably much better at a lower player count.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (February 2018)

Due to the Unlock! series of games, I have become a big fan of escape rooms. Before playing the game I never considered going to one, but now I have played all the Unlock! Games (I love them all) and I went to two real life escape rooms. I love this genre and I was very excited to play any Exit game until I found out you have to destroy the components, due to this, I decided I was never going to buy any of the Exit games. A group of 4 friends bought the game and we played this month.

I have a bittersweet feeling about the game, like T.I.M.E Stories, once you played through it, you won’t play it again because you already know the answer so it has zero replay value. And to make things worse, you have to physically destroy the game while you play it, so any resale value is lost. It isn’t about the money though, I was raised in a third world country and I was always taught that you do not waste if you can avoid it so I loathe legacy style games that destroy or permanently modify the game. To me, it is immoral and unethical to create games that are disposable (even more when the designer can easily make them resettable), even if they create a great experience.

After playing Exit: The Game – The Secret Lab, I can confirm that it is possible to play the game without destroying or modifying anything (you need a little patience and creativity. but it is possible) and we played it this way. In fact, we already sold the game to be enjoyed by another group of players.
 
After playing Exit: The Game – The Pharaoh's Tomb (which offered harder puzzles) I was expecting a harder challenge, but sadly, solving this one was way too easy, we finished it without using any clue (I never allow anyone to see the clues anyway, it is a thing for me). I would have preferred to play it only with 2 players, we were 4 players and many times a puzzle was solved before even I could peek at it, so I was bored a lot of the time as I couldn’t contribute. In general, I prefer to keep the player count low because all players cannot see the material at the same time and this issue is worse in the Exit series of games as they come with a notebook full of clues but only one player can look at it at the same time. I don’t know how the publisher recommend this game up to 6 players, in this configuration, some players won’t even see the puzzles.

After playing the game, I see no reason for the game to be truly disposable. The designers could have easily made the game resettable, this is a big issue for me. If I do play any other Exit game I will do my utmost effort to not damage it.

Bottom line, Exit: The Game – The Secret Lab is an ok escape room game. I wish it offered a harder challenge (which I crave, I dislike easy games). My desire to play all the Exit series of games is very high, but I won’t buy the games due to their disposable nature (an unsurmountable obstacle for me). I can perhaps play them with friends who bought the game. After playing it, I can say I prefer the Unlock! series of games, I really prefer the flexibility an app brings to the table and you don’t have to destroy the game while you play it. I would normally rate the game a 6.5 or higher, but I can’t, in good conscience, rate a disposable game that high.
The next Exit game I will play with only 2-3 players.

I loved playing Exit the abandoned cabin but this game was not as enjoyable. My wife and I found moments in this game where we felt unsure of exactly what direction the game wanted is to go in and some of the clues not as clear as in the other Exit game we played. Perhaps this game may have played better with a larger group but after having so much fun with the abandoned cabin and it's cleaver clues and great flow, this game left us not as excited to try the third one, the pharaohs tumb

Our 4p group had fun even though our performance was laughably poor (as measured by the rating scale included in the manual). The puzzles are clever and engaging. The story itself was rather pasted-on, I can't really recall any details of the plot. Like actual escape rooms, the fun is contingent on having the right mix of personalities on board.  I enjoyed it enough that I purchased one of its sequels (which has yet to be played), but I don't see the Exit series or any of its many genre-mates becoming a new passion.

Wow. This one took us over 3 hours to beat. We don't like using the clue cards so there was one or two things we got stuck on because we missed something fairly obvious. 
That being said, there was nothing really good or really bad. Pretty average.
My biggest complaint was that it felt too much like work, for some of the puzzles. Some of them just weren't fun at all. We even got a little grumpy and came close to snapping at a each. 
Not what you want when playing a "game" together. 
Plus, I hate that playing it, destroys it.  The unlock games at least can be passed on to friends. Not so with this series.

RATING: 8.5
We played this as a family (2 adults, 2 kids 11 and 8) and enjoyed it quite a bit.  The puzzles felt very satisfying and there was some good variety. The story moved in a way that made it easy to focus on 1 puzzle at a time, and while the puzzles were tricky, finding the solutions generally felt clear and definitive.  The overall story wasn't very strong, but it was enough to tie the puzzles loosely together.  We've also played the ThinkFun Escape The Room series and a few from Escape Room: The Game.  I liked the puzzles here in Exit best.  ThinkFun's were also great and maybe even built a better story, but it's a bit simpler, which is nice for families to keep younger kids involved.  ER:TG was not as enjoyable to me - the puzzles felt random in the sense that we often not being sure about our answers since they didn't seem to tie in to anything.  There was a lot of "Well, I think these 4 things go together, I guess this might be it?" and we were often  correct, which was very unsatisfying.  As I mentioned, in Exit, the puzzles were hard, but we knew when we figured it out and that was much more fulfilling.

We just tried the teaser edition at the fair in Essen. The quality was surprisingly good for a game, which you can just play once. Nice ideas even if the teaser version was a little bit to easy. We did not use any support card a escaped in less than 18 minutes. But the staff at the both confirmed, that the "real" game will be more complex and not so easy to solve. Therefore, we are curios to find out what happens in the secret laboratory!

This was my first escape room game, and I'm afraid the experience has soured me on the whole series. The player count on the box is dishonest. This game is probably a 3 player game maximum. During my play we had 5 people involved, and invariably the strictly linear nature of the puzzles only managed to engage 2 of the players. They saw the clues and the answers faster than the rest of us did, which meant they kept solving puzzles one after another and some of us never got to contribute anything meaningful. The timer is just an afterthought meant to gamify the puzzle. It's better left ignored because it only serves to induce anxiety and hinder the satisfaction of puzzle-solving. Too bad the one-time nature of the game means I'll never get to re-evaluate it.

Entertaining. Some of the puzzles were a pretty tough to get a handle on, and I don't like the way the first clues are always totally useless (every time we already knew that).

Suggest.

We played it with 3 which seems like a better number than 2 players as everyone is still involved in the game and 1 person more makes 1 more brain to solve the riddles. I still think the Escape the board game is the better game in the niche as it puts more pressure on the players and has the cool 'machine'. This was an enjoyable experience though although some of the riddles were easier than some of the others. We escaped within the 90 minutes time frame. I like the abandoned cabin a bit more than this one.

I was skeptical of the concept of a once and done escape room in a box, but eventually picked up a copy at PAX.  The game is excellent if you are into picking a good puzzle apart.  The game, while only playable once, gives you an enjoyable and challenging experience.  My only caution is to not overpack the group you will be playing with as there are only so many clues to look at, so you may find yourself looking around waiting for a chance to get involved at points at 4+ players.

RATING: 7.5
A solid escape room game. I'd say none of the puzzles felt super hard, but some of them were pretty clever, and we finished just over the 60 minute goal time (missed it by 45 seconds!) without using hints. Looking forward to playing the others in the series.

Escaped the Lab alone in 88 minutes and 19 seconds.
Two (2) help cards were used, earning a 7-star assessment.

Enjoyed the puzzles and design of this series - very nicely put together package and worth the price of admission. This game was much harder to keep in reusable condition - there were two puzzles in particular that wanted me to mark on game components, one which was hardly worth being called a puzzle at all.

Obviously lacks replay value. Rating represents my willingness to try other games in the Exit series, as this one is essentially "done" for me.

One notable negative: the game suggests between one and six players, but smaller groups are best in my opinion. There never seemed to be more than one puzzle active at any given time to keep a larger group busy, so it really feels designed for just one or two people to play at a time.

RATING: 7
We really liked The Abandoned Cabin and The Pharaohs Tomb, but I found this one uninspiring.  The other two allowed for more people to be engaged at the same time, this one allowed two at best, there were times that two of us were bored out of our skulls because we could not add anything.  There was also one puzzle where we did it according to the instructions, as presented in the game, but didn't get the answer, three clues later, we still have no idea what they were talking about. We like the series and look forward to future releases, but this is the weakest of the first three.

Well, this was a surprise, having loved the Pharaoh's Tomb and really enjoyed the Abandoned Cabin, I was hugely disappointed by the Secret Lab which just felt like homework and ended up not being an enjoyable experience at all. If this is meant to be the ‘first’ in the series, I'm glad I didn't play them in the 'right' order, as I would probably have been put off the others entirely. No secret, didn't enjoy this one.

It was okay. We beat it in 2h 30min without using any clues, because we were thinking into riddles way too harder than it accually is.
I kinda dislike this "once play" board games, but it was fun.

I did not know quite what to expect from this. I have previously played the three scenarios of Unlock and enjoyed it, but been underwhelmed overall.
This one, however, was a different beast. A lot more puzzle and logic than Unlock. Enjoyed it much more than Unlock. The game system is ingenious and prevents accidental solutions or cheating. Only downside is that it ran an hour too long. Perhaps we just need to learn the logic of the game, but I hope the next scenarios are shorter. 

A huge plus is also that there are no hidden clues on the pictures. Everything requires logic.

Completed without destroying any components (without much trobule).

This just didn't do it for me on the same level that escape the abandoned cabin did. This felt clunky and we had to check a few solutions to this one and then even then they just didn't make sense,

RATING: 8
Game damaged beyond re-use in its one play; this was my introduction to the EXIT system.  It felt a bit trickier but a bit more linear than alternative systems.  Playtime obviously depends on the players, their aptitude with puzzles and their willingness to use hints but we took 2 hours with no help.  Half an hour of that was spent on two items so with hints it would have been nearer 90.

Pros
- Clever puzzles that you figure out JUST before they start getting frustrating

Cons
- Expensive for only getting 60-90 mins of play

My wife and I absolutely loved this game. I will be picking up all the other games in this series once I see them go on sale - the price is a little steep for a one-and-done 60-minute experience.

RATING: 7
I had never done an escape room before.  Neither a real full-fledged one or one of those little home kits that have been popping up for the past few years ever since escape rooms had garnered popularity.  This is a tiny escape room in a box.  It is comprised almost entirely of a deck of cards and a booklet.  There are also a few little cardboard pieces used is specific puzzles.

The game starts you out with a singular puzzle to solve (on a card) and a book of clues that help with that puzzle and many other unseen ones.  After you solve the puzzle you'll unlock others.  Some can be solved with the information you have unlocking even more and others are just pieces themselves that need more unlocked in order to tackle them.  The game of course also comes with clue cards for each of the puzzles if you get stuck but if you are measuring your performance after, the use of clues comes with a penalty.

We escaped in under an hour with one clue used.  I had a great time with it and would really love to do a real escape room some day.  The constant thought in the back of my mind that we are being timed gave things a sense of urgency and tension.  Meanwhile the puzzles were just hard enough to challenge us without feeling unfair or impossible.  And when solving a puzzle you feel awesome and intelligent and when others solve puzzles you feel a small swell of pride and community.  The experience is one I would recommend to everybody.

The elephant in the room though, this game is one time use.  You really do need to take pen and scissors to components in this game to solve the puzzles, there is no opportunity for salvaging it.  At 15 bucks the other players in this game felt it was really worth it.  I'm a little more on the fence about that.  And I'm someone who has a fondness for a lot of expendable/legacy games on the market right now.  I played through a Risk: Legacy campaign and am in the middle of both a Pandemic: Legacy and Seafall campaign right now.  However, those games give me dozens of hours worth of playtime out of them for a 4x cost.  This game took me less than an hour.  I enjoyed it, don't get me wrong, but when I'm done enjoying it it's only an hour later and I'm out 15 dollars.  I'm sure the cost reflects what the company could make it for and the store carry it for.  Also, we played 2 more after this and each person in the 3-man group bought one so it was really more like I paid $5 for each which really doesn't feel bad at all.  It's still worth mentioning.

No sólo es que sea una experiencia jugable de un solo uso, es que son sólo 10 pruebas, algunas buenas, otras regulares y otras muy malas. Me ha parecido un intento de llevar al tablero cierto tipo de juego de PC. Podrían haber hecho el juego para ser rejugado aunque supiésemos la solución. Incluso podrían haber hecho que al final quedase un juego nuevo/distinto. Se ve que han intentado subirse al carro de los legacy, y no se trata de un legacy. Dependiendo del jugador puede ser entretenido a ratos. No tiene mucha temática. Recomendable para 3 o más jugadores, idealmente para 4.

Spoiler-free comment:

The Abandoned Cabin was the first Exit game that I played and I have to say that it was more enjoyable. Maybe it's just my group, but The Secret Lab had several puzzles where we got to the very end but couldn't quite find the solution so we had to use the solution cards. This one also took quite a bit longer for us.

While it's not terrible, I wouldn't recommend this one.

I enjoy puzzles. Some of the puzzles weren't that bad, but to make a "game" by stringing puzzle after puzzle together didn't' work for me. Personally, I didn't mind working through the puzzles solo. I do not feel it works with more players. We played EXIT with 5 people and it divided the group into some that pushed to finish (just to finish, not for the fun of it) and some who were either lost or didn't care.

Excellent game. A lot of difficult puzzles. Compared to abandoned cabin this is a lot more difficult and offers a lot of braingymnastics in one box. We spent nearly 3 hours on this case. Downside is it requires you to destroy components unless you color-copy and proxy a fair amount of pages and cards. In any case any new room in the series is an autobuy!

interesting puzzle game, similiar to Unlock but found it way easier.

did not need any clues, did not make any mistakes, did not have to "break" the components (we did 2 photocopies instead of writing on components).

it's cool, but not as good as unlock.

[+] good puzzles, on the easier side, ~1h game, game system works well, I assume there are enough clues to never be stuck

This series of one-shot escape games provide a similar kind of puzzle solving as seen with real escape rooms and are very creative in their puzzles.  There's not enough here to justify the full player count though; 2 or maybe 3 players is enough.  I would recommend that they are played in the following order: Abandoned Cabin, Secret Lab, and then Pharaoh's Tomb.

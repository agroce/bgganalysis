EMOTICON REVIEW: :)

[-]I just ordered it.Can't wait to play with my daughter[/-]

Nice components and the kids liked it very much.
First time we played 3 times in a row which is an accomplishment!
Excellent game for kids (for ages from around 4 and up).
The rating is based on my daughter's opinion but overall is a nice addition to my collection.
I can play without getting bored.Playing time is around 10 minutes.We usually play for 30 minutes each time.

A great game for young children. Dice rolling, memory work and a cooperative mechanic. I've played this at least 100 times with my daughter. It is a bit tedious now but was a lot of fun when she was 3-5.

RATING: 7.5
According to the reception by my daughter as one of her 3rd birthday presents, I must admit maybe she is too young or she was too excited with the rest of toys to concentrate with the game. [b]Night at the stable[/b] continue in her top of boardgames, even more after she asked to play it the day she got the little orchard as birthday present. I predict we are going to play this game less than night at the stable in the coming months.

Primarily a memory game.  If your child can narrow down where at least one crow is, they can guarantee a win.  Otherwise, a pretty enjoyable game.

This is a cooperative memory game for kids with a flower-dice. You have to find cherries before the raven eats them first.

I love coop-games, we played this a lot! (and still do occasionally)

Simple childrens' memory variant. It's a cooperative game where the players attempt to turn over all the cherry tiles before the raven reaches the tree and eats the rest. Not much of a game here for adults, but small children think the game is great.

Our 3-5 year old nieces and nephews love this game!  A great co-op game for a kids-with-adults game.  Their favorite part is getting their uncle to do his loudest raven "caw."  He is always a good sport.  This is the game the kids beg to play!

RATING: 6
Of the three "Orchard" Haba games we own this is our favorite.  Adds a little interest for the adults and still very rewarding for the kids.  A little less "once you're winning you're more likely to lose" than My First or the original.

You will win almost every time given you can remember about 5 tiles. Therefore, this game is for VERY young children, but it is pleasing in part due to the nice material.

A game my son had as a gift: he loves the raven and cherry minis and he starts to recognise the colours (tile-die) and remembers where the cherry under what tile is. He also loves putting the cherries on the tree and in the basket (and again, and again, and again...)

This is another orchard-themed co-op game for little kids from Haba, and it was another success.

Essentially, this blends the fruit picking from orchard with a Memory-like tile mechanism.

We had to play 4 times to win - which is shocking to me. 
 Even with good memorization skills, luck can prevent you from winning...

Game for very young kids.

You roll a die and pick a card based on the die roll. Each side on the die corresponds with 3 cards of the same color; a raven, a cherry, and a sleeping animal. Sun allows you to pick any card. If you pick a raven, he moves toward the cherry tree. If you pick all the cherries first, you win.

This is basically just Memory, but oh how my kids love this one. It's got JUST enough for them to feel like they're really playing not just a kids game (they're 5 and 3) while having enough charm with the chunky components. It's a winner in my house.

Rated as a children's game. This must be one of the most endearing and cute children's games around. I played with the daughter of my friends who is almost three and was amazed to see that she was actually able to play. Of course she needed guidance and didn't grasp all the aspects of the game, but whereas before the game I thought it would be hopeless (she doesn't even speak properly and only sometimes understands when spoken to), she was actually participating in the game and reacting appropriately.

Fantastic game for young kids. My almost-3 daughter has lots of fun, we all like cawing when the crow turns up, and there can be real tension about whether you will win or not.

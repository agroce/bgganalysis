GAME: Saboteur
RANK: 839
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It plays very different depending on the number of players, with 4-5 it takes a good bluffing for the saboteurs to win, with 6-10 is can be a little chaotic and all depends more on luck that other thing. I prefer a small group, but both options are fun, besides is small, fast and easy to teach.

Juego ideal para días de campo o fiestas familiares, hasta 10 jugadores, simple y rapido de pillar, ameno, adictivo. Tres rondas de este juego pueden llegar a la media hora si se esta jugando con 8 jugadores o más, si son menos, puedes terminar en torno a 10 minutos antes. 
El juego tiene mucho juego en grupos,empiezas la partida dudando de todos, y conforme se va adentrando en la cueva, se empieza a dividir el grupo en dos, aunque siempre hay alguien que te hace dudar. Muy bueno para el precio que tiene, unos 10 euros. Por cierto que hay web chinas que lo ofrecen a unos 5 o 6 euros envio incluido, las cartas no tienen dependencia de idioma, y las instrucciones se encuentran en cualquier sitio.
Si te juntas con familia o amigos en grupos y quereis echar una media hora simpatica es perfecto.

Advent Calendar PROMO 2016: Saboteur: Dwarfs & Gold Promo 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
"7" is a provisional rating based on 2 plays with my niece and nephew.  They were crazy about it and would give it a ten.
Edit: After a game with 6 adults that was great fun ("Evil Dwarf!") I'm upping the rating to 8.
Update: My niece and nephew bug me about this game every time I see them.  So this visit I brought them their own copy with me.  So now their mum and dad will get bugged to play as well!

RATING: 5.5
Initial impressions: Setup is a pain for such a quick game. Component quality low (but reflected in the price). The game itself fell flat this time, but think it could be a solid filler if the group gets on board, particularly with how there should be some competition between the miners to be the one who finds the gold. Seems much more difficult for the saboteur(s) if this is ignored.

Scoring in this game is pointless.  For me, the fun comes from each round and I could care less about being the overall winner.  This game shines with a large amount (7+) of players.  Avoid like the plague when played with less than 5 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun deception game. Plays fast and enjoyable. I would like it a little more as a pure co-op with traitors rather than the weird cooperative/competitive element. By round 3, we were blocking the leading players even though we were pretty sure they weren't traitors, leaving all of three people playing. It's fun and I'd play it again, but only in the context of needing a game for a very large number of players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great fun playing, but the scoring is just ridiculously nonsensical. I'd only recommend it if you can ignore scoring or make some house rules to fix the terribly flawed system.
With a proper scoring system I'd have given it an 8 or 9.

This is a really fun game.  Maybe it's one of those that anyone who regularly plays games with 6 or more people should own.  You can play it with less players but it's best with 6 .  There are a lot of subtle strategies in this - mostly concerning the timing of when and where you play certain cards and sometimes about sending others subtle hints about what you're doing or what you know - for instance, if you're a digging-dwarf, blocking or making it tougher to use the path to a finish card you know to be a rock. But there again, players have to read whether someone else's first movements are a subterfuge or for real.  You can be sure that experienced saboteurs will not reveal themselves quickly or easily!  

A lot of fun for a little money.

This is a great game.  You have to talk a  lot to one another: try to make someone belief that it is not you but definetly someone else who is the saboteur. Give comments on every card that is played and you will like this game a lot!!

A coop card game with a betrayal mechanic that doesn't take too long to play and has a light theme about mining. The game plays like a conflict based waterworks where you are all trying to build tunnels to three possible pay days with one real one. Saboteurs get involved, equipment gets sabotaged, things get real.

It's really nice to have a game which handles up to 10 players, but our plays so far have not been that great. The Saboteurs always EASILY won the game (the opposite result that most people report here), but I can't find anything we were doing wrong!  Hopefully, more play will reveal the play balance and be more fun.
Update 2005 05 14: The chances for the saboteurs change pretty dramatically bases on the number of players. Our original plays were using the worst odds, whereas my latest plays have been the opposite. I like it well enough, but it's too bad it's not better balanced.

Fun first game this weekend, but with only 4 players. Can't wait to try it with a bunch, should be lots of crazy fun.

Have since played with 6 and 7, and it's a lot more fun with more, and also when you tell everyone at the table that it's part of the game to lie to each other!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Different roles, different objectives. Roles are dealt randomly to player. A dwarf will have to build a continuous, uninterupted path to the gold mine. Saboteurs will have to prevent the dwarves to do so. The game consists of path cards, both normal and dead end. There are red special cards to stop players from playing path cards and green ones to 'free' player so that they can continue playing path cards. Map cards to take a peek on the 3 possible face down card as only 1 is the gold mine. And finally, the explosive card, to destroy the path card.
 
Fun, fun, fun game. Because nobody knows who are the dwarves or the saboteurs, making the table conversation very interesting. Players will try to give hints and sign languages to show their allegiance. Lots of lying and lots of poker faces for sure. So be prepared to be cracking your head, figuring out who's who.

And the game can be player from 3-10 players making it a good game for big groups.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

A game that is easy to play and learn.  A semi-cooperative game divided into 2.  One party consists of good dwarves trying to dig for gold when the other party of saboteurs is trying to prevent them from reaching the gold.

Besides building cards which builds the tunnel to reach the goal, there are map cards which players can peek at 1 of the 3 goal cards to see if they are gold or stones.  Earthquake cards that allows players to destroy 1 building cards played.  Freeze cards and unfreeze cards are there to prevent and allow players to build the tunnel respectively.

Good points: Easy to learn and fun to play.

Bad points: The fun of the game mostly resides in the saboteur side.  Almost all the players wishes to be the saboteurs.  Uneven winning chances as there is a higher percentage that the saboteurs will win.

Too bad that it becomes obvious who is saboteur and who is not, but this is not always 100% clear. Sometimes players have to make moves they don't want to, thereby classifying them as saboteurs. I also have the idea that it is more difficult for the saboteurs, but then the reward is also higher.

The basic concept of this game is terrific.

A cute little game with a reasonably clever concept. Quite fun with the right group, moreso because of the group interactions than the actual gameplay.

Nobody in my game group is competitive enough to turn on their teammates if they're not playing as a saboteur. As a result, it's far too easy to figure out who's trying to do what and it degenerates into luck of the draw.

There's nothing wrong with Saboteur except the end of game scoring mechanic, which is completely useless.  Basically, you need to just enjoy playing the game because it's rarely the best player who comes out ahead.
The other real issue is how much BETTER The Resistance is.  It completely outclasses this game in almost every way.

A great game in a small package.  Features the intrigue found in such games as Bang! and Shadow Hunters and packs it down into a clever package themed around Dwarven mining.  The hidden roles aspect is fun to ponder over and the game mechanics are solid, intuitive and visually enchanting as you construct the tunnels.  A great game all around which I can play with both new gamers, meat-loving gamers, kids and adults.

Played three games of this last weekend and just wasn't thrilled. It's just way too easy to figure out who the Saboteur(s) are (you might as well flip your role card over the second you lay a dead end, cave in. The only real way to stay slick is to view the treasure cards and build the path to one of the non-treasures), and since they are outnumbered by the miners, it just lacks real tension imo. Trade available.

{1 play • 10 players} It was certainly a lot of fun, which is good, but I'm not sure how much "game" there is here.  After the second round, a LOT of players were definitely out of the running, which kind of sucked.  Now maybe that's just the 10-player game - or maybe it was just *our* 10-player game - but I suspect not.  I'd play it again, though, especially with fewer players, just to see.

Fast, light filler that plays great in a large group and is really easy to teach. 

I'd imagine that this game would be amazing if played with the right crowd. The game unfortunately has become very repetitive for me since players never change it up to make things more interesting. It'd be better if the game encouraged bluffing a bit more.

Recommend playing with the variant where miners that have broken tools when the gold is found don't get any gold. It adds a more semi-cooperative feel to the game and leads to fun backstabbing amongst miners.

This game allows a large number of players to participate, but there is definitely a sweet spot for number of players.  It's not clear, but it is likely around 7.  The game is somewhat cooperative.  If the dwarves cooperate reasonably well, the saboteur players are very unlikely to be successful.  Not clear if the game is correctly balanced to the various roles.  If all players had to take a turn as a saboteur (not sure how to implement this) it would ensure the balance.  Good for larger group as a filler.  [GTI Code: TGCL]

RATING: 7
Fun game, but you really have to play a few games before the game is fun... the reason I say this is that so much of the game is a balancing act between giving yourself away and performing moves to your advantage.  In order to get a feel for the balance, you need to have a rough idea of what the constituency of the cards is, how long it would take you to get to the end, and a rough idea of how long it will take to get there.  I figure it takes a while to hit the rating I gave it, and then maybe tails off after a few rounds...

RATING: 7.3
Although very simple, this game is fun. I think the game is well balanced. With 1 saboteur the game is harder for this player, but if he wins he wins big (4 gold nuggets). If 2 or 3 saboteurs are present it is easier for them, but they only win 3 gold nuggets each. And with 4 saboteurs they only win 2 gold nuggets each.
From 3 to 10 players.

There are some strategies for the saboteur player(s). 

1st - If you can look at, early in the game, a goal card (at this point you know where the gold is, it's either on the card you've seen or in one of the other two) you can direct efforts towards a (false) card and thus making the good players lose precious time, this is the most efective way to win, I think, because you play as though you're trying to win.

2nd - you can buy time, not adding a path card and building up your block cards, if you can block other players you can stop their progress, of course that other players will block you immediately, but since being blocked only prevents you from playing path cards, you can still continue to block other players.

3rd - you can destroy a path card that is in such a position that is very dificult to find a replacement and thus making the other players lose precious time trying to fill that empty space with an apropriate card, even better if you happen to have another of those boulder cards, after players find a matching card for that place, you immediately destroy it again, at that time it will be almost impossible for the good guys to win.

usually a good saboteur player will try to do a mixture of the 3 options, meaning: trying to mislead the other players into a worthless goal card, accumulating block cards, and holding on to the special cards that destroy path cards and playing them at the right time.

i really hate this alpha in one group demanding that all miners MUST build forward, and that anyone not doing so is a saboteur. of course, i NEVER built forward while playing with him, i made sure to break his pick/lamp/cart whenever i could, and never played any more team/coop games with him. 

this game CANNOT be played with such house rules. miners should be allowed to pretend to be saboteurs, or re-direct the tunnels as and when needed. sub-optimal play increases the fun and accusations. 

fortunately, every other player i have ever played Saboteur with isn't like him.

Less obvious who is who than Bang!, easier to learn, faster to play, and everyone stays at the table. Variants (no gold for dwarves with broken equipment, saboteurs know each other, treasures at different distances, etc.) increase the options, and flexibility is always nice. The scoring system (where an individual player wins the overall game even though each round is played in teams) makes sense to me (it rewards the best player over multiple rounds), but has proved confusing to a couple crowds; in those situations, most people didn't really care who was the overall winner after a few rounds and didn't even bother counting their gold. Perhaps this is a testament to how fun the game is: players didn't even care who won (even though they took gold after each round), but were just happy to play the game. At any rate, Saboteur is a [i]lot[/i] of fun with the right crowd, but you do have to assess whether you have the right group of people before breaking this out or it won't meet its potential. This is a wickedly fun game in a small package – very underrated on BGG, and very worth checking out. 

Variants used: (i) good dwarves with broken equipment do not receive gold; (ii) saboteurs know who each other are; (iii) center goal card is one space further from the ladder; (iv) first player to [i]x[/i] points wins ([i]x[/i]=10, or some other number depending on desired game length). (2008-10)

RATING: 7
Very light sorbet game. Better suited to >4 players, less than that and the game seems heavily stacked toward the saboteur. Seems to scream for house rules. Gold allocation for scoring is so random the result usually prompts disatisfied comments (last game 2 players retrieve the gold once each and share victory a 3rd time, one scores 7 the other 3!!!).

A great little filler which is always a laugh. Must upgrade to a 7.

A decent hidden-role game that is pretty simple to teach. I'm not a fan of the broken tool cards as they can really handicap someone early on and if they don't have the right card to fix it or someone can't/won't do it for them, they essentially get eliminated. For this weight and group size, I personally prefer Bang! The Dice Game as it has a bit more "game" to it. Plus chucking the dice is more fun.

Very well enjoyed six player game, good fun gaming with larger groups, get in on a game if you can, familiarity is not required, nor particularly more helpful, but come on, who is NOT familiar with the mechanics of deception anyway? give it a shot!

Picked this one up, it's cheap, its fun, it supports up to 10 players and I really like the new cards! Good game great purchase, looking forward to more plays!

RATING: 7
This is the only hidden role game I've ever played but I do enjoy it a lot and love to see the maze form.

To combat the frustration of having a broken tool and nothing to fix it with for a whole round, I recommend borrowing a rule from Saboteur 2 that allows you to fix the tool by discarding a card from your hand. You then play the remainder of the round with 1 fewer cards in hand. Of course, if you opt for this, you will draw the card to fix the tool almost immediately afterward, in keeping with Murphy's Law of Card Games (I made that up--don't bother googling it).

RATING: 8
This is a fun little card game that has a really clever component to it that makes it really fun.

Some players are trying to dig tunnels to treasure cards, while other players are trying to stop them.  The problem is that no one knows what anyone's agenda really is, and that makes every card played potentially revealing about the player who laid it down.

It's great fun, fast and well balanced.  I'm quite impressed with this one.

I likes this game ok at first.  I introduced it to some friends and this is all they wanted to play.  I have introduced it to young children, and they have learned the game just fine.  I wish I loved it as much as my nongamer associations, but with each play, I like the game less and less.  There are few interesting choices to be made when playing the game, but it is a fun little game when played in moderation.

Played this with a non-gamer group and they hated it.  The saboteurs just crushed them because they didn't work together very well.  Also, my wife and I happened to both be saboteurs which wasn't really the fairest thing to happen because we are by far the most competitive and experienced gamers at the table.  My wife and I really saw the potential in the game and quite enjoyed it, but won't get it out with that group again soon.

RATING: 6
The tug of war that you feel in this game is quite nice, but it's often easy to pick out who are the saboteurs based on their actions.  It also doesn't evenly reward the successful miners which seems unfair.  I'm not sure if we will play this game on a regular basis, but for a once-in-a-while game it's a real blast.  Unfortunately, Rikki hates it and has declared that she will never play again, which doesn't bode well for the future of the game.

There seems to be a distinct difference in the feel of this game depending on the number of players.  With more players the saboteurs can remain hidden better.  However, if fate makes it so that there are not many saboteurs, they will struggle to slow down the miners.  I think my favorite part of the game is that players can help other players, and even flat-out lie.  With a good group of liars the fun is definitely amped up in this game.

Plays better than most games with a bunch of people (nine players works great). Not very deep on strategy, but it is fun to sit around and accuse each other of being the a saboteur. Each round seems to come down to a nail biter. The always seems to be a couple people who enter the last round with no hope of winning.

If you've got a large (6+) group, then this is quite a good choice. It seems so far that it's tough to be on the "evil" side, as the "good" guys have usually won in the games I've played.

I have some personal problems with the games, as it seems to turn me into an a**hole - I've been known to screw others who have screwed me, even though we're both on the "good" side...I can't help but tit for tat, it seems.....

A really good game for 6 or more people.  Playing by the rules, our groups have found the dwarves (non-saboteurs) have too much success.  There are many posts here on the Geek about how to fix this and I recommend checking them out with this game.  A recent play with 5 players reminded me that the game does work with this number.  While this game is very simple, in my experience it has been just plain fun.

Just bought the Greek version for 10 euro.It's for 3-10 players and lasts 30 minutes.It's a card light filler.Can't wait to try it.

29,Nov.08
The quality of the cards in the Greek edition is low but then the price is very low as well so it is not much of a problem.The gameplay with 3 players was fantastic.I can't wait to play again with more people.

Good in larger groups (would not recommend for 3 or 4). The saboteurs almost never win during the first few games, then people realise that the miners are also competing to be first to the gold - at that point co-operation decreases noticably. Suggested house rule - miners with broken picks, lamps or barrows when the gold is reached do not get a share.

RATING: 5
I was disappointed by Saboteur, for this isn’t the game I was told it was: it’s quick, easy and light-hearted, I agree; yet it’s just remotely fun and, most of all, its gameplay is pretty bugged: actually the traitor element has been developed only superficially, for after just a couple of turns it’s pretty obvious who the saboteurs are. And from that point on the game becomes a rush to prevent them from playing, often successfully.

The whole game feels like an «uncollaborative cooperative»: Saboteur looks like a cooperative game indeed but doesn’t make for a cooperative play because of the way dwarves receive and share the gold cards when reaching the goldmine. Okay, dwarven greed is notorious, yet Saboteur’s dwarves look more like David the Gnome than D&D’s, so this victory points mechanics feels just out of place.

Cute little game where dwarves build tunnels out of cards. Much better than Chtulu reskin of Water Works! Having a potential person who may be working against you is great as it adds a nice dimension. The only thing a little strange is how points are distributed. But with the game being so short and light - you play for experience more than winning i think.

Dead simple card game with dwarvern miners trying to reach the gold. Place cards to make tunnels towards 3 gold cards, but watch out for the (1 or 2) saboteurs who are trying to stop you. There's "break" cards to prevent you playing and "fix" cards to fix yourself or others. Entertaining stuff, not a lot of thought required, but good clean fun.

With only 4 players this one didn't feel as dramatic as I was hoping.  I'm looking forward to playing with more people.  I'm not positive I like the variant rule of sabotaging a Dwarf right before they find the treasure.  It seems pretty harsh and might resort to the Dwarves burning every sabotage card on each other rather than working toward the goal... perhaps that will be a good thing to help out the Saboteur, but I haven't played enough yet to know if the Saboteur needs that kind of help.

Have only played once but the mechanics in the first play felt wrong.

Good, with plenty of players.  Typically, one Saboteur will get recognised early, so it helps if there are a couple of others to back that one up.  Also quite difficult to block one player from doing especially well if they get a lucky gold draw early on.  Certainly not a bad game though, and would definitely get play with large crowds.

I think people are starting to come around that this just isn't a very good game. It's not subtle enough: either you know exactly what someone is or you have no clue. It's also too much of a bad play to damage someone as your only option on your turn. Think about an 8-player game: you spend your one turn (of say 5 or 6 you'll get) to damage one other player, leaving 6 other players to perform actions that help them better than what you just did helped you.

The scoring is pretty wonky too with the blue vs green dwarves. I think the original game might actually be better, but I've really soured on this in general of late.

Don't remember all the scores, but I won with 4 gold due to having the sole Geologist in the first round and lots of gems came out - even though I never played one and had almost nothing to do with the game's outcome. I'd rather play Slide 5 any day; at least there's more you can do to actually affect your position!!

I played this with 10 players. That was too many I think. However, there were laughs as we were trash talking the saboteurs. Okay for larger groups (say 5-8 players). 

Update: I have now played this with 5 and that isn't so great either. Maybe 6-8 players. Maybe. I just don't think this is that great of a game - Bang, Citadels, or Slide 5 more fun.

Update again: Painful. Why was this game invented?

A great, chaotic filler game for a crowd. We enjoyed the game a lot but had a few gripes with it. If one of you're tools are damaged and you don't have the card to fix it, you cannot do anything but beg for other players' mercy. And the gold distribution is very random.

We house-ruled the gold distribution such that the one who finishes the tunnel to the gold gets 3 gold, all other dwarfs get 2, unless they have broken tools then they only get 1. If the saboteurs win they always get 2. 

Both issues are fixed by the Saboteur 2 expansion, which also comes with new roles and new cards and overall makes this great game even much better.

Juego de roles ocultos, aunque cuesta ocultarlos, con pequeñas dosis de puteo. Entretenido y sencillo de explicsr/jugar pero para mi gusto se queda un poco corto.

I enjoyed this game for a number of plays, but it seemed to burn out faster than I would have liked. The imbalance between digger and saboteur is a little troubling. Since it's so hard for the saboteurs to win, there isn't a lot of tension in figuring out who is who; the 'goods guys' are likely to win regardless. This saps the game of a lot of its energy.

I didnt enjoy saboteur the few times I've played it (especially not with low player counts). If the group suspects you're the bad guy you'll get screwed (whether their thought was correct or not). Maybe it works a bit better with larger groups, but I'd rather play different games then. Kids love it though, so I have to hold on to it a bit longer...

Updated 10/30/10.

[thing=9220]Saboteur[/thing] is a mediocre hidden-role, teamwork/traitor card game in which players assume the role of miners extending a network of tunnels in the search for a hidden vein of gold.  It is also a very good example of wasted design potential.  

Saboteur is played over three rounds.  Before each round, one or two miners are secretly assigned the role of Saboteur, and will only win if the remaining miners are unable to connect the mine to the vein of gold.  If the Saboteurs are successful, they get a windfall.  If the miners are successful in discovering the gold, they all share in the reward, with the miner having played the winning card getting a relatively larger cut. 

I like the idea of a reasonably short (45-minute), tense, role-deduction game, and Saboteur's central premise and core mechanisms seem well-adapted to that end.  However, Saboteur is ultimately damned by imbalanced incentives and needless randomness. 

The entire idea of a hidden-role/traitor game (or at least the only part of the idea that I consider to be worth building a game around) is that the traitor should be able to impede the success of the team while appearing to be working for them, leading to mistrust, accusations, and in-fighting.  Here, the deck gives the Saboteur player three tools to prevent building.  But two of them -- rockfalls and dead-ends -- would never be played by a conscientious miner.  Consequently, playing one of these cards is a clear give-away that you're the Saboteur. (And if you're outed early, you're extremely unlikely to win.)  To some extent, this flaw turns on the fact that the game allows players to discard a card in lieu of their turn, meaning miners are never forced to play a sub-optimal card.    

Broken tool cards are a different story, at least.  The third weapon in the Saboteur's bag of tricks, a broken tool prevents the miner it is played against from building any further tunnels until the tool is fixed.  An optional rule (I have no idea why this is optional) prevents miners with broken tool cards from sharing in the treasure if the team succeeds.  Thus, unlike rockfalls and dead-ends, the miner players, at least have some incentives to employ broken tool cards against each other, when nearing the end of a round.  The problem with broken tools, however, is that they are disastrously random (a broken tool comes in one of three types and may only be fixed by a repair card of matching type).  The effect of playing a broken tool turns almost entirely on whether that particular player happened to get one of the few repair cards with a matching symbol, which is nothing more than dumb luck.    

As a card game, I was excited by the potential need for clever hand management, but there is no need.  Most of the tunnel cards are relatively effective at extending the tunnel most of the time, so players are strongly incentivized to simply hoard repair cards and broken tools, playing whatever tunnel they happen to draw.  The whole thing is a imbalanced mess that lacks much interest or tension beyond the first few hands.  In the games I've played, the Sabateurs never win, either because the hidden information doesn't remain hidden long enough, or because keeping it hidden brings the miners too close to victory too soon. 

While I certainly still prefer Saboteur to much of the cartoony dross that passes for filler these days (e.g. [thing=116]Guillotine[/thing], [thing=1927]Munchkin[/thing], [thing=770]Loot[/thing]), it disappoints in large part because it obviously could have been so much better.

A filler game with a traitor mechanic?! It's nice to have one that isn't also a social deduction game. I normally don't like "take-that!" cards, but they work in this game. You need them to shut down the miners who you suspect are crooked. Think that guy's about to close off your most valuable tunnel? Quick-- break his lantern! Snap his pick-axe! Leave him stranded to starve alone in the dark!

This is not a hidden traitor game. Hidden traitor implies, well, hidden. But the saboteurs lack the tools to hide. All of their tools are out there in the open. We see everything they do.

And there isn't much they can do. They are badly outnumbered, and it's really just a question of cards. The saboteurs have to get really lucky with their card draws in order to either draw a majority of the forward progress cards so that the goal cards can't be reached (or a combination of them plus rock slides).

So the game only has bite if the dwarves fight over who gets to draw gold first. But unless it's the last round, I think most dwarves in the first and second round are just hoping that the other dwarf players draw saboteur cards in the final round. Because all too often the dwarves are content to get the gold, even if it means getting last pick.

Picked this up after hearing it called "the new Bang!" Pretty disappointing. It's boring, and the gold collection at the end feels tacked on and clunky. The need to play several rounds to determine a winner doesn't work for what should be a light little game. The hidden role mechanic is at its worst here... it's extremely difficult to hide that you're the Saboteur for long, mainly because the game doesn't give the dwarves enough incentive to repeatedly harm their rivals (especially not when they could be furthering themselves). In the rare circumstances that we have 9 or 10 people around for games this could work, but beyond that I'll stick with Bang!

I'm a fan of hidden role games and I think this one is pretty good! It can be hard (almost impossible) for a saboteaur to win if he's alone against 4 dwarves, but there is also the evil rule that dwarves with broken tools don't get any gold nuggets, so even if you're on the same team you sometimes want to play a broken tool in front of one of your teammates... Devilish!
A fast and exciting card game that I see myself playing more in the future.

Much prefer this to Bang (which also has secret identities) - much shorter and no elimination. Only 5 minutes to explain, 40 minutes for the three rounds and handles up to 10 players! This game needs to be played with accusations flying and plenty of speculation about who the saboteurs are, so works much better with friends. Played in a polite silence, this would be awfully dull.

Variants: Non-saboteur dwarfs who have been sabotaged (by anyone) do not share in the gold if the dwarfs win. (This encourages dwarfs to become a bit greedy and sabotage their own side when they come close to winning) and can add a bit of uncertainty as to who the saboteurs really are. Also put one or even two map cards aside. If everyone knows where the gold is the game is a lot less exciting.

If you have a ton of people, this can provide some good diversion. It isn't the best game out there, but if you have a lot of people over, it can work as a filler in a pinch.

edit: With better games like the Resistance, I don't really see the need for this game. It's really hard to be a Saboteur with higher player counts and the game itself is not that interesting. Almost always, it's difficult for the saboteurs to be subtle enough not to be caught.

This just proves bluffing games are not for me as I am not great at it which makes the game experience not fun for me. I spent 2 of the 3 rounds getting tools destroyed early on and was never able to draw a card to repair them so I spent most of my turns discarding hoping to get a useful card and it never happening. Being put in that sort of situation doesn't make the game fun since I'm not really doing anything for the majority of the round, I'm just cycling through cards. If there was a way to help yourself besides simply drawing cards maybe the game would be better. However, doing a card draw and then having to wait 6 turns to do the same thing again while everyone else is building the map is boring.

RATING: 7
A game of sabotage packaged in three short courses.  Much of this game is luck:  the cards you draw (miner: "I had a great saboteur hand the entire time!!"), the number of saboteurs (too few saboteurs usually leads to a runaway victory for the good guys), the arrangement of players around the table (for when the good guys pass the loot around).  It's still fun and (sometimes) quick, and since roles are recycled each round, most players get a shot at playing both sides during the course of the game.  Most of the games I've played have been with a large number of players (6+), and I feel that the deck runs out too quickly in these cases.

In a game with a lower number of players (e.g. 4) the Sabatour might as well just embrace his role and start screwing everyone right away. Then they just -might- thin the deck in their favor by the end. 

Much better with a larger number of players.

RATING: 5
:indigo: Nifty variation on the Mafia/Werewolf theme. Like any social/co-op game it requires the right crowd. Good game but a pity about the scoring; the whole scoring system seems to have been thrown together at the 11th hour by someone who checked a dictionary and discovered that games have winners. I'm more of a journey-over-destination kind of guy myself so I don't much care but it seems like there should be a better way to do this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Although the premise of the game is nice enough, its execution fails because not only does luck play a huge part in this game (e.g. saboteurs not getting any dead ends or special cards), it also depends on the saboteur(s) being able to stay hidden. When all non-saboteurs just go full co-op, this is simply impossible. One lone saboteur will have a very hard time winning at any rate.

The rule swapping after each round is not very effective.

In my opinion, some cards should have a different effect for a saboteur player than for miner players. This way, despite their identity being revealed even faster, lone saboteurs would at least stand a fighting chance. A good example would be a saboteur being able to discard three random cards to obtain the effect of any special card - or maybe limited to repairs only.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
As the number of players increases the level of enjoyment increases. Things tend to be tough for the saboteurs though. There isn't really any subtle way to play as a sabotuer.

RATING: 7.5
Good with 5-7 players.  Any more and it takes too long.  Any less and a lot of the game play is lost.

Totally random, screw-your-neighbor hidden-traitor filler. There is scope for clever play and an escalating finale, but I really don't see this getting any more plays, not while games like One Night Werewolf and Resistance are around. A lot of dead-end cards are very often useless or give-away, depending on whether you are a traitor or not. With more experienced players, the game deteriorates into a last few rounds fight. 

Will play if asked, but will not seek to play it again.

I like playing this game just fine. Its fun to have kind of a werewolf thing going on. But the scoring is screwy. Last game I played, I was on the winning side all 3 times, but came in 9th of 10 players. Still, its quick enough that I'd happily play in a large group setting any time.

Definitely playable, but ultimately ho-hum. Too few decisions to make and too many times to be left action-less.  Perhaps the game requires more table-talk than the groups I've played with. In the end, someone retrieves the gold (or doesn't) and it just seems like the luck of the draw rather than skilled planning (or scheming).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Seems to play well somewhere in the 5-7 player range, beyond that there isn't enough control to adequately accommodate the bluffing and second-guessing the game wants to have.  With the right group, this is a good one full of naughty language and bickering with the wrong group (or a big one) it gets tedious pretty quickly.

So far I've only played this in a large group (10 players) which seemed to make it a bit frustrating with so much happening between your turns. I suspect the game would be great with 4-6 players. But still the fact that this game can play up to 10 is pretty awesome.

Nagyon kedvelem ezt a játékot!
Mi az utóbbi időben megpróbálunk mindig páratlan számú emberrel játszani és 5 főnél 2, 7 főnél 3, 9 főnél 4 szabotőrt alkalmazunk (magyarul mindig eggyel kevesebbet mint aranyásóból van). Így bár egy parányit egyszerűbb kitalálni ki a szabotőr és ki nem, de a szabotőröknek is mindig van esélyük győzelemre (pl. 5 játékosnál 4 az 1-ellen, vagy 7 játékosnál 5 a kettő ellen nagyon kevés a szabotőrök esélye).
Ha párosan vagyunk akkor alapból nem jó az elosztás hiszen pl. 6 játékosnál 3-3 szabotőr és aranyásó van, ami szinte garantálja utóbbiak sikerét, ha viszont 4 aranyásó és 2 szabotőr akkor az már az előbbieknek kedvez.

Elvesztem a részletekben, bocsi. :)
A lényeg hogy remek játék, főleg olyan társaságban ahol van több olyan aki szeret elméleteket gyártani és dumálni, csendes csapatnak nem nagyon (sőt egyáltalán nem) való.

Előnye még hogy 8 évesek is ugyanúgy tudnak játszani, és élvezni azt, bár sokszor belekavarnak, pl. letesznek egy lezárót mert elfelejtik, hogy el is lehet dobni. Persze ilyenkor mindenki azt hiszi, hogy ő a szabotőr és mindenkit megtéveszt, aztán a végén vannak nagy derülések, hogy mégis ki-kicsoda volt, szóval ha lehet gyerekekkel játszani, akkor ki ne hagyjátok! :) 

Nekem NAGYON BEJÖN ez a party- felvezetőjáték! :)

One play.  The game seems to have a lot of potential ... but I think you need at least five to experience it.  Looking forward to another play with a larger group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great, casual fun in larger groups, especially as you play through a few rounds- first, as the inevitable new players get a handle on what's going on, and second, as the individual play style of players begins to emerge, despite their potential change in roles.  The inevitable Mafia-style paranoia comes out, particularly as players begin to discuss the board layout and potential plays, or beg for repairs.  

The breakage mechanism can leave you just sitting there with a dwindling hand if you can't convince someone to fix you, and there can be long gaps between your opportunities to play, but what's going on with the other players and the opportunity to contribute to the discussion (for good or ill) is entertaining enough not to make it boring.

In certain circumstances, usually when the Saboteurs are doing well, a deck inventory would be helpful: knowing that all the rockslides or appropriate tunnels are gone could help you decide whether the game is unwinnable, giving you the opportunity to cut it short and move on to the next round.

The ongoing scoring system is interesting, but not necessarily rewarding the best play from players, though as you develop further expertise as a miner manipulating the payouts can be an interesting tactic.

Strongly considering a look at the expansion- though there may be learning curve difficulties given that with large groups a few players will inevitably be new to the game.

The players are dwarves digging to reach the gold that is hidden at one of three locations.  But one or more of the dwarves are saboteurs, trying to foil this plan.  Since the roles are hidden, it's fun trying to guess who the bad dwarves are OR trying to effectively sabotage the process without revealing your identity.  The game scales well from 3 to 10 players, but it's best when the saboteurs are not tremendously outnumbered.  The scoring system can lead to players having no chance of winning in the third (and final) round, so it's best to treat each round as though it were a single experience (kind of like a party game).

Good light game where you are given a secret role of either tunnel digger or saboteur. The diggers try to place tunnel cards to lead to one of three destination cards to get the cold, while saboteurs play hazard cards and obstacles. The roles don't remain hidden for long, but that doesn't seem to take from the fun.

Production: Nice artwork on the tunnel and tool cards.  I might prefer tiles once they are on the table, but it's definitely easier to hold a hand of cards.  Play: The jury is still out for me, but I did enjoy this.  I felt that the three rounds provided the appropriate length, and resulted in various teams.  It's fun to try to identify one's teammates, and there are a few ways (thought not many) that one can cleverly sabotage the team without it being blatant. (2+1+3) (1 play)

Although a light/random card game, the 'who is the bad guy' element in this game is a fun twist.

This game is OK.  I like that it is simple enough to play with my daughters (8 and 5 years old) but also fun enough to bring out to play in my adult game groups.  There is some subtle strategy in the game that comes out with more experienced gamers.  Card luck plays a significant role in the game - it sucks if you can't get the right card to fix a broken tool.  Some games can be spent picking up cards.  All in all, this is a decent, fun game.

One of my favorite party games. Every group I introduce to this game LOVES trying to figure out who the saboteurs are. Classic moment: my dad yelling at my mom: "YOU're the dirty saboteur!!"

Very easy to learn, very quick, and a lot of fun. Highly interactive and draws people in easily.

Good group game that entails a good bit of play style similar to "Bang!". Anywhere from one to three saboteurs, depending on the number of players and the luck of the draw, in the group try and undermine the effort to find gold in a dwarven mine. Great fun finger pointing and accusatory mistrust.

RATING: 4
I want to like this, but it simply doesn't work for either me or my group. I suspect that we're simply not nasty enough to create an interesting and tense dynamic. There's virtually no incentive for the miners to squabble amonst themselves and there is only marginal benefit in the saboteurs keeping their identies secret (it's hard enough for the saboteurs already without them waiting longer to spring some kind of surprise). We also don't find that it's particularly 'fun' in the story-telling sense, as there is no clear narrative, sense of individual progress/personal achievement or any particular identification with your own 'miner' (who is at no time represented on the 'board'). I bought this game after researching on BGG but, unfortunately, it has turned out to be a big dissapointment.

RATING: 7.7458
Reminds me of kevan's Things game but working out who is the saboteur seems less essential and there's more of a need for the saboteur to show their hand.

I feel the game may be weighted towards the diggers - since useless cards can be played at the start (working back if needs be) a traitor that plays genuinely counter-productive moves can be easily spotted.

All a saboteur can do to screw the diggers is either lie about the location of the gold or play tunnels in sub-optimal places but the latter is too easy to see through once everyone's played a full round and gotten the hang of it.

When trying to decide who is lying and who isn't, the game can be a brilliantly tense affair. When on the brink of failure - with only a few cards in each player's hand - similar feelings arise.

A great game for getting to know folk better - seeing how folk lie and play a traitor reveals traits usually unseen.

Despite any arguable imbalance, the brevity and speed of game-state-change keeps it fun, light and interesting.

This is a fun little card game of team work and deception.  It's particularly enjoyable to lie about what card is what and have your friends fight over whether you're lying or not.

What sets Saboteur apart from other social deduction games I've played is that even once the Saboteurs are discovered, they are still involved in the game. It becomes a battle of whether they can use their cards to damage or slow down the dwarfs to stop them reaching their objective.  Great game and lots of fun!

A positive point is that Saboteur plays up to ten people and it works equally well. Or equally bad for me. If I have a 6-10 people roup I will definately prefer games like Bang!: The Dice Game, or The Resistance: Avalon over Saboteur, which I find really pointless.

A really good fun game for just about anyone. Great as a filler or end-of-the-night game with a committed gaming group but also very accessible to family or other, casual, groups.

Importantly for gamers; a single round is rarely a satisfying experience - you really need to play the full three rounds to see strategic play.

The base game is fairly good for high player number. After the first excitement though, it started to lose appeal and divert to better/quicker bluffing game. 
The expansion multiplied by 5 the interest in the plays: the extra characters and action cards are what the base was lacking although it spikes the learning time for new casual players making it too high for its weight. 
Overall nice, although I would rather prefer Coup, Resistance or Mascarade

The game is pleasant enough, but the saboteur(s) is/are usually easy to spot. Not much reason to play it unless you're looking for something for more than six players, and, even then, Take 6 and Incan Gold are better.

RATING: 7
I like the Saboteur game and it's one of my favorites, but I think it needs a few rule changes to make it more even between the good miners and the saboteur. The center gold card should be moved 2 more spaces away from the starting card. It takes 9 cards (sometimes 8 if you come from underneath), to get to the 2 outside gold cards but only takes 7 cards to get to the center gold card. It's too hard for the saboteur to stop the group if the gold is in the center. I also think the maximum number of times you should be able to sabotage someone (stop the saboteur) should be 2 or 3. It's hard enough to try to stop the other miners once the saboteur is discovered. By limiting the number of times you can stop someone with a broken lantern, pick axe or cart, it will give the saboteur a chance to win the game. The saboteur has never one in any of the games I have played. I came close 1 time but the last person left with any usable cards had the right path to get the gold.

Ok game where you either play a dwarf digging for gold or a saboteur trying to hinder the digging. Unfortunately it's too obvious who's who. I wish you could hinder in a more secret way.With the extra rule that only good dwarves with no broken equipment can share the gold it's a much better game.The best part of the game is the greed aspect where the "good" dwarves try to hinder each other from finding the gold. Wonderful!

This almost belongs in the beer and pretzels category. We played with 6 players. After one round, we immediately eliminated a 'loyal' dwarf so that we would always have two Saboteurs.

The 'traitor' aspect is really what makes this game work. I think with some rules tweaking, many groups would enjoy this on a regular basis. As is, it needs some work.

Jópofa kártyajáték, amit lehet gyerekekkel is együtt játszani. Gyakorlatilag a játékban törpék szerepébe bújunk, akik a földalatti járatok építésével próbálnak az aranyhoz eljutni. De ez még nem minden, néhány törpe bizony megpróbálja szabotálni a munkát, s ez adja a játék savát-borsát. Nem árt, ha van egy gyanúsítgató is a csapatban, aki kellőképpen hintába tudja ültetni a többieket, ezzel is emelve a játék hangulatát. Persze idővel kiderül ki(k) a szabotőr(ök), s onnantól bizony nehéz dolguk van. 4 fős játéknál eltértünk a szabálytól, ami azt mondja ki, hogy 4 törpe és 1 szabotőr közül választjuk ki titkosan a szerepünket (amit a forduló végéig titokban is tartunk), de így a szabotőrnek 3 törpe ellen nem sok esélye volt. Ezért úgy döntöttünk, hogy 3 törpe 2 szabotőr legyen a választandó szerepek között, ezzel növelve a szabotőrök esélyét. Nekünk ez így jobban bejött. Családi játéknak kiváló, s a kezdők is gond nélkül belevethetik magukat a vájár tevékenységbe, mert néhány egyszerű szabály meghallgatása után már jöhet is a móka. (2014.08.16.)

Saboteur: Simple, Fast and Fun.   A very mellow ‘traitor’ game that can function as a good icebreaker.  The rules can be picked up quickly (be sure to point out the iconography rather than relying on the artwork on the cards) and this makes a great party game.  At some point it is inevitable that players who are saboteurs reveal themselves, but the best thing about this game is that those players are not out of the game in any way (as is the case in many of these ‘traitor’ games); they still have a 50/50 chance of winning by working with their fellow saboteurs and messing up the other players.  Even if the other players ‘break their tools’, saboteurs can STILL win, which may sound like the game tips in favour of the saboteurs, but I’ve seen an equally balanced number of situations when either saboteurs win or when the good-dwarves win, which is a good sign of a well-balanced game.

This is one of three games I constantly have with me. It stays in my car because it has the ability to cure that empty space in any given night that begs to be filled with a fun boardgame. Its flexiblity with number of players, silly theme and player interaction make this a hit every time.

Interesting cooperative tunnels digging game with traitor(s). It includes a lot of digging and take that cards with sabotaging tunneling operation in the right moment, pretending it's for the good cause. Sharing loot in the end is maybe not perfectly fair. But OK game overall.

Superb!  A fantastic little game, very light and highly thematic.  I always play with the advanced rules (loyal dwarves with broken tools get no gold), put the center goal card an extra space away (to prevent a single tunnel card revealing two goal cards) and the saboteurs-in-cahoots rule (like Werewolf -- everyone closes their eyes, then the saboteurs open their eyes and see who each other are).

A phenomenal gateway game, a great introduction to hidden role games, a great filler ... what's not to like?

i got this for a while, it's quite fun.
when you try to judge is it your best friend is your enemy or you boy/girl friend your allies. i usually bluffing with my action some times literally bluffing my role. just to put some fun whose your allies or your enemy. 
the best part of this game is that you tackle your own allies. your gonna regret that dude! (really!)
i usually used all the stack gold for point, so when you play with 4 player you'll probably play 5-6 round. 

but when bcos this are card game, the usually get worn out. 
and sometimes my friend give some dirty trick to give the gold where they are. (not cool at all) and all the player will obviously know whre the gold are. i think they should made the goal card bit tougher.

RATING: 6
This is fun basic filler, but I find the saboteur is usually quickly blocked with calamity cards for most of the game with little to do but discard, with everyone being limited to 1 new card per turn.  As such, 3 game rounds or more are required for final scoring which should hopefully balance this out.  

There is no real social deduction or 'traitor' aspect like in Shadows Over Camelot/BS Galactica/Dead of Winter.  The saboteur(s) should usually become evident relatively early, so success just comes down to the cards.  However players can still compete to receive more gold and block others (by using the optional screwage variant).  

I tend to think that an undiscovered saboteur should also receive some found gold, but this isn't in the rules.  There are a lot of mine sneak peek discovery cards and annoyingly, the results usually get divulged early on.

Saboteur is an every man for himself game disguised as 3 rounds of a hidden team game. As a gold digger you firstly want your side to win, otherwise the saboteurs get all the gold. But you also want to be the gold digger who finds the nugget, so you can get the most gold.

Saboteur struck me as a condensed, Werewolf-esque game. As I don't like a similar game, Bang!, I thought that Saboteur was playable and much shorter (in a good way) than Bang! is. For whatever reason, Saboteur did not work too well with my group, hence its rating.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Despite the strange scoring mechanic (I think it needs a house rule to be more fair) it is an amusing but also kind of random game that scales well for 6 or more players. So far we liked it best when having 4 miners and 3 saboteurs in the team, so that the saboteurs really have a chance of winning some rounds. But the most fun parts of the game are the accusations based on questionable moves, delusions and trick-maneuvers. The later you reveal being a saboteur the more fun it can be. Hiding your identity as long as possible is actually the toughest part.

(As of [b]2[/b] plays) A co-op/traitor game in filler card game form. Despite the simplicity, there are heavy doses of wild accusations, unfounded suspicions and all-around squabbling, especially with the optional "Greedy Dwarf" rule in play. There is some concern that it is too hard to win as a Saboteur, although in most rounds it has come down to the last few cards. A great party game that can easily be taught to non-gamers.

[b]1 year verdict:[/b] This has not worked at all with my regular gaming group. It [i]did[/i] work quite well with a group of casual and non-gamers, but I'm not sure I'm justified in keeping it.

I've played this with my young children and it was ok. It just feels weird to be trapped due to a broken piece of equipment and just keep on drawing one card a turn, waiting for the right card to come up. My kids like it, but I feel like it erodes parental trust!

Now that I've played this with adults and my kids are older, this is a lot of fun. More players makes this game a lot better.

Secret roles and bluffing like Bang, Werewolf, Shadows Over Camelot: a fun party card game that can handle up to 10 players, good for non-gamers.  Being on one of two secret teams is the most fun, and the scoring isn't really that important.  If the gold miners win too often, play it less as a team game, and focus on being the first gold miner to get the gold, or play the variant where gold miners who have broken equipment at the end of the game get no gold.  Try the [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/141246]Werewolf Variant[/url], where the Saboteurs reveal their identity to each other before the game when the Gold-Diggers have their eyes shut.

A decent but not great game for a large group. I love the concept, but in practice it's almost impossible to play detrimentally as a saboteur and not be noticed. So it ends up being just a question of when to reveal yourself by doing a dick move. Then you get piled on with broken this and broken that. It's still an OK experience for a large group that wants to talk more than think, but it could be a lot more interesting if they could shore up this weakness.

Some fun, but I had little agency in the three player game I have played so far. There could be a layer I'm missing, but it seems hard to be the saboteur because good moves are fairly obvious. Either way, the game appears to mostly come down to luck of the draw.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Saboteur does one thing that most party games do not, or cannot do and that's make what is a game of accusation and paranoia accessible to a group of younger kids!  Normally party games aren't as accessible because you have to mentally process motives and possibilities whereas Saboteur delivers the party game vibe in a visual way.

The goal?  Get to the gold if you're good dwarves, if not; stop the good dwarves getting to the gold so you can have it all for yourself.  Play three rounds, whoever has the most gold at the end wins.

Players play cards in a tile-laying fashion to get to the end hidden treasure (two are duds, one is legit).  A player can do one of three things on their turn; place a tunnel card, break/repair people’s tools (tunnels can't be dug with broken tools) or discard and draw a new card.  The game’s tension is increased by an artificial timer of the deck, once all the cards are played or discarded, that is it.

This game is just as fun for adults and I personally believe it ups the suspicion factor over most games in a not overly confrontational way.

Half the fun is the early phase where you are trying to find out who's who.  Then it's in the gold diggers best interest to look out for one another, but not so much that you end up being the last to pick from the treasure booty.  The saboteurs can up to a certain limit, sit back and enjoy the show and pick the right time to wreck the whole plan.  For such a small game, I find there is a lot of fun to be had.

RATING: 4
Don't play this with fewer that 5.  Better with more players.

We played with 3, and it is very difficult to actually win if you don't win as the Saboteur at least once.  Played again with 5 and then with 7 and it was much better, although the saboteur's won twice with 7, at it seemed like they had the advantage.

I liked that it is pretty short, and that you play it 3 times to get a winner.  The route building is also good.

What I don't like is that it is usually very obvious whether or not someone is the Saboteur or not.  There is no point in the regular players to do anything other than reach the goal.  They should dump their bad cards rather than play them.  The saboteur has to dump cards and just say that they have nothing and then at the last moment drop down a rockslide or broken tools.

Another thing I don't like is that you need a specific fix card for a specific broken tool.  I got hit with a broken tool, and never once got a fix card for it the whole game.  I would like the fix cards to fix any of the 3 broken tools.

I'm a fan of the possible variants where the middle card is pushed back one card, as well as the miners not getting a gold card if they have broken equipment.

This is the best card game I've played that can handle up to 10 players.  It is very engaging, and an excellent gateway game that's sure to cause lots of groans and laughter.  It is tremendously fun, especially for the little amount of strategy there actually is.  It has been a huge hit with gamers and non-gamers alike.

Jogo de cartas onde os jogadores são, secretamente, mineradores ou sabotadores. Os mineradores tentam escavar o túnel para encontrar o ouro. Os sabotadores tentam impedir que os mineradores alcancem o ouro. Cada jogador pode cavar túnel, olhar o mapa da mina, atrapalhar outro minerador (ou sabotador) ou passar a vez. Poucas regras mas muito divertido. Recomendado para 6-10 jogadores, especialmente, quando forem novos no hobby.

Somehow it only seems to work with 4 players. With more, a number of problems arise, one of which is that the distance to the goal doesn't increase even if more miners are present. It therefore becomes almost impossible for the saboteurs to block the miners.

Aranyos partyjáték, ami nehezen kerülheti el, hogy összehasonlítsák a banggel, mivel ez is kártyás, sokan játszható, aránylag rövid, és itt is csapatokba osztva dolgoznak együtt, illetve egymás ellen az emberek, csakhogy a játék elején még senki se sejtheti, hogy ki-kivel van.
Egy játék után jobbnak érzem a bangnél, több benne csavar, kicsit nehezebb kitalálni, hogy ki kivel van. Az is jobban tetszett, hogy kevésbé rombolós, mint a bang, ahol gyakorlatilag, minden kijátszott kártyával valakinek ártasz. Itt lehet építve is rombolni, ami szintén jópofa lehetőség. A jutalomkártya-húzás elég nagy randomitást visz a játékba, de ahogy láttam ezt a kiegészítőben orvosolták. Kíváncsi vagyok, a kiegre, nomeg az alappal is kéne még jópárat játszani.
A legnagyobb előnyt a végére hagytam: mindenki egyből felfogta a szabályokat, és mindenkinek nagyon tetszett a játék, pedig nem gémer társaság volt. Egy partyjátéknál azt hiszem ez az egyik legfontosabb tényező.

Completely luck-driven (especially since the scoring is totally bonkers), almost no (real) choices to be made by the players, and almost no chance for the saboteurs to keep their heads low and the treasure hunters in the dark. It is beyond me why anyone thinks making people sit out for the entire round with nothing to do is a good idea, or fun.
There are so many better candidates for short filler games.

You rely too much on what you are dealt, and sometimes are rendered completely, permanently helpless early in the game through no fault of your own when you just can't draw the right cards.  I also wish there were more ways to communicate with others on your side. Any cooperation feels really haphazard.

Beware people who haven't won any gold at the start of the third round. If they don't have a chance at winning a lot of people will sabotage their own side: they feel there is no incentive to keep playing.  

I really never enjoyed this game and sold it in 2014 after not having played it for several years. Resistance and Mascarade are much better deduction games.

I played this game 3 times and it felt like the Saboteurs didn't have many "useful" choices; they may mislead the miners (there are too many maps for this to be effective), sabotage the path early on (you will pretty much be out of the round after this) or sabotage the path at the last minute (there are usually enough cards to clear paths). It might help if the saboteurs knew each other. Additionally, it seems like Saboteur 2 addresses my concerns.

I really want to love this game, but so far it has fallen flat when played in our group. I think the reason is that we tend to play too much in a semi-cooperative manner where we are trying to make sure the evil dwarves fail, and not in an every man for himself way. I want to get this to the table again.

Received in trade 06/09/06.


Okay filler--too much chaos with a larger group.  Rounds seem to go too quickly to be able to do anything--either it's a beeline for the gold or it's too hard to make it in time.  

Plus, there's little room for subtlety, making the hidden role stuff less important that it should be--it's usually quickly obvious who's who.

Not sure how soon this will ever get to the table again.

Ha! Okay- Saboteur doesn't try to be more than what it is, but eff this game. It's realllly stupid. If I want a game with a traitor mechanic, I'll go to something a little meatier than this. Even filler-wise, this is just a bit too brainless to enjoy. The idea that you can shut people down from mining and that they have to have the right cards to get out of it, or their turn is essentially skipped each round. Wow. I get why it's there and I can understand why some people might find that kind of punishment "funny", but holy shit is it an annoying part of the game. How is this game in the top 1000?!

A fun co-op/back stabbing pipe laying filler.  Saboteur offers in a small package, and short playing time a fun alternative to most of the usual fillers.  Group play is fun, and dirty.  initial score of a six, due to some lackluster participants, but feel as if this could rise in raiting with a different crowd.

RATING: 6
A great little game.  It plays okay with 4 players, but really shines at 5 or more when you get 2 saboteurs.  It is nearly impossible for a single Saboteur to win and even two have a hard time.  I am looking forward to playing with more people to see how the dynamic changes and to trying the expansion to see if it improves the game by balancing out the obviousness of the saboteur.

I was surprised. This is a fun game if you have a large enough group. People sometimes tend to get carried away and decide to play like a saboteur which at times is mind boggling. You combine an evening of this with Citadels and you have a social experiment gone wrong.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a surprisingly good game.  The more people you have, the more saboteurs you potentially have, and the more fun the game becomes.  It doesn't even matter if the saboteurs are found out - the gold diggers can be ruthless about blocking other dwarves and preventing them from getting a share of the gold.  
Saboteurs are at a huge disadvantage, but it makes it all the more satisfying to win as one.  

I think my rating for this game suffers from the fact that I would be very reluctant to play this game with fewer than 6 people.  

My students love this game.  There is quite a bit of interaction and laughter when they find out they were hurting their own team and they don't quite understand the strategy, but they have a good time.  A 10-player round is over in less than 10 minutes, including set-up.

Update --- rating keeps going down on this one. You just have _so_ little control over winning and losing. It's okay as a group activity, but there's very little game here. And as such, it lasts too long for the full 3 rounds, at a bit over an hour.

Very clever take on the secret-identity game.  I like how the Saboteurs must weigh when to "reveal" themselves through their play, since once they are obvious, they can be shut down by breaking their tools.

A simple game that draws from multiple styles: co-op, social deduction, strategy, and more. The game must be played competitively!

To give the Saboteur an equal chance of winning use this official variant: good dwarves that have broken tools at the end of the round do not receive gold if their side wins... this adds a lot more to the meta game, as often quite innocent dwarves have their equipment broken because they have already won "too much gold".It makes it difficult to truly determine who the saboteur is..

Also in 6, 8 9 player games the Saboteurs could use a slight edge to improve their chances.  Try the Werewolf Variant suggested by Aaron Kurtz, where the Saboteurs secretly reveal themselves to each other at the start of the game.

game heavily contingent on the type of people you play with. first game was horrible, as the group of people i was playing with weren't that interested. gave it a 2nd chance with an entirely different group of people, and was more than happy with the results! game shines when players get into game and assume their roles. lots of room for paranoia and hilarity to ensue.

RATING: 7
In the main game all gold-diggers (exept the saboteurs) get gold when someone finds it. The finder gets to pick the gold card first. In the official variant only the diggers who have all their gear intact can obtain the gold. The gold is distributed only amongst the diggers who could actually dig.

This turns the game a little bit interesting, as now not only the saboteur is using sabotage cards against everyone. In the normal game it was hard to "bash the leader" or make shure you have the most gold in the last round when being a digger. Now you can just brake the everyones stuff just before revealing the gold.
A couple of games have been a fight between the diggers, and loosing the gold even without a saboteur.. 

I prefere the variant over the main game because it allows a little bit of tactics into the three game rounds. As the gold-diggers are fighting amongs each other, the saboteur can start blocking the pathway for good.. Usualy at this point the diggers find a new harmony, atleast until the tresure is only one card away.. and stuff start mysteriosly breaking again

RATING: 8.5
The kids in my youth group LOVE this game. Of course, everyone always hopes they get to be a saboteur, but those who aren't have a blast accusing everyone else. The game inspires interaction and rivalry, and those aspects only increase the more we play it. I really like the fact that it scales well all the way up to 10 players, but you really do need more than 4 to make it really interesting. Minus half a point for less exciting gameplay with less than 5 players, but still a great game.

One of my favorites with 8 people. It distills the "traitor" element from Shadows over Camelot into the true essence of the game. We have found that, for the traitor to work, we don't allow any table talk. There's some strategy, even as a non-traitor, to try and influence who actually completes the tunnel, but it can be pretty tough to manipulate, knowing that your influence can cost the group from sharing in any rewards, period.

- Saboteur 2

Tried playing with 2 players (which is my fault as the game isn't designed for that). There doesn't appear to be much ability to bluff with lower player counts as it's immediately obvious who is trying to prevent you from getting to the gold. The broken pickaxe is really annoying to get out of.

Apparently this is fixed in Saboteur 2, which I've yet to play.

Decent, and plays quickly enough to be a useful filler. I do wonder if the saboteur is too weak in the base game, though, and discarding cards face up makes it too obvious who is who, so this is one of the very few games I've actually tweaked.

RATING: 6
Light and silly, with a fun "who's on whose side" aspect that's done far better than, say, Bang!.  My main problem with the game is that you can't take it at all seriously; the only parts that aren't almost entirely random are when you're trying to decide who's on the other side so you can play your bad cards on them.  The two sides don't even seem to be balanced; at least in a 10-player game, it seems that the saboteurs definitely have the upper hand.  (I've only played with 10.)  But, anyway, it's a silly game, works with large numbers of people, and is still fun, so I can't fault it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I've played one game with 10 people so far.. it's at the limit for people, probably better with fewer because we ran out of the deck so quick.  The game was a bit slow, #1 because of 10 people, #2 because it was the first time playing and each person would spend up to a minute trying to decide what to do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game is a nice cross between Bang and Carcassonne. It has a good amount of player interaction and luck, but not too much. It definitely plays better with more people in order for there to be multiple Saboteurs. Plays very quickly. A little too hard to catch a leader, but the game is more fun in the playing than the winning anyway.

RATING: 8
Rating of 6 after 1 game with only 4 players. Seems very tough for a lone saboteur but I'm hoping with more players and saboteurs it will give them more of a chance.

Quick and seems like it would be fun with a group of 6 or more though.

Edit: Played again with 6 players and it was highly enjoyable. Still not always easy for the saboteurs but when they do succeed they are well rewarded. Quick, simple and great fun.

Further edit: Played with about 9 or 10 people at the end of a 24 hour gaming session and it was so much fun!!!

I was first introduced to this at Shire Gamers, where we'd play with anywhere from 6 to 10 players... It is tons of fun, especially with a group of people who are up for a bit of table talk, accusing each other of being saboteurs.

I then introduced it to a few friends at work. It went down extremely well, but has a different feel in a much smaller group, as we can only play with at most 5.

Have since taught the game to virtually every group I play with, and it always goes down very well. It may only be a filler, but for the sheer enjoyment it is a solid 9 for me.

It offers some fun as a filler. Luck plays a big role, but there is also a bit of bluffing and tactics. More rounds would certainly help to even out the luck, but then the game might become too long for what it is. A good thing is that it supports up to 10 players, and there aren't many games for that niche.

Played it once more after maaaany years and nothing has changed for me. I'm not a big fan of the traitor mechanic and even less a fan of a completely luck driven game. Draw cards, lay them out to reach any gold spot of which you don't know holds the gold or not.

If you don't get the right cards, it can happen that you just don't do anything unless others help you, but that can take a while, as they don't know if you are on their team.

A fun little hidden traitor tile laying game.  You are navigating a maze, and either trying to help find the gold or trying to hide the gold, by laying down maze-like cards to move a path to the gold.  It has a neat bluffing element to it, as even once people figure out what side you are on, you can fake them out in different ways.  

It doesn't seem to scale properly - we had seven players and the rounds where it was 4 / 3 were tense and interesting but one round where it was 5 / 2 we hit the gold so fast it wasn't even fun!

I like how different it feels just to play the two different roles. I also like how easy it is to punish obvious saboteurs, making sneakiness a requirement. I think this game does a good job of encouraging tabletalk without encouraging whining. There seems to be a fair amount of chance; getting a first turn map can be huge. It also seems very difficult for saboteurs, especially if there is a lone saboteur, and the payoff is not that great. Even so, it is easy to grasp and plays quickly with a large number of players. 
UPDATE: Rating upped a point when played with the optional rule about not getting gold at all if you have a broken tool. This game is much better with it.

A somewhat fun little game that can handle many players.  Unfortunately, the saboteurs are generally easy to identify (they have very little incentive to hide for long and can work together if there are several saboteurs), yet can be highly effective at stopping the miners.  In fact, with multiple saboteurs, the miners can only really win if they get very lucky card draws.  (This might be remedied if the ratio of valid to obstructed path cards were slightly higher.) Add in the fact that scoring is based on the number of gold icons on drawn cards (making it quite random - the winner will usually be a player who had the role of the saboteur the most).  This can be a fun, back-stabbing filler with the right group, but loses its luster relatively quickly.

Some caveats that we found after our first play:  In 2 of the 3 rounds the saboteur was not subtle enough and thus was blocked early in the game, which imho spoiled the fun for them a little. Otherwise it's a neat idea. Some more special effects would be nice - does Saboteur 2 add these? Would try again with a higher player count.

Nice filler game, with super easy rules. The hidden traitor gives life into the game. I can see why so many people play it all over the world. It needs at least 6-7 players to be enjoyable, which is hard to get. I tried it and it was a great experience. I will play it again if im asked to.

This game is for you if you want a quick pacing game that's a load of fun and that gives you a chance of being mischievous person (and enjoy it, mwahaahaha!!!). Elves or gnomes (whatever really) are digging through hard rock forming tunnels in search for gold nuggets. But one (or many) of them is a saboteur. This is one of those semi-co-op's, but in the end only one player can win. Negatives of this game are unimpressive artwork and the fact that in the end there's way too little game in this game. Also the fact that you might end in a situation that you have no options (no legal moves left) and you just have to discard all the time is frustrating. 
Works best if played with at least 4 players.

This is a card game where everyone is secretely either a good dwarf or a saboteur.  The good dwarves are trying to reach the gold in the caves and the saboteurs are trying to stop them.  This is a great game when you have 7 or more players.  It is faster than Bang! and does not have any player elimination.

RATING: 7
In my opinion, a more sophisticated version of Incan Gold/Diamant. The players, representing Dwarves, mine their way in through rock, in a race to get to hidden gold. Players alternate placing cards that depict the tunnels they mine, but they have to line up, sort of like that plumbing card game from childhood. The first dwarf to get to the treasure has first crack at the spoils, meaning less and less gold for the others clockwise to the first player. So, this is a mad dash to see who gets there first. Meanwhile, one of the dwarves may be the 'saboteur', who gets 4 pieces of gold for thwarting the mining, a la the traitor in Shadows Over Camelot, or the cylon in BSG. There are a number of 'screw your neighbor' cards which literally paralyze another dwarf, preventing him from playing cards other than cards the undo the attack cards.

It's great fun, with a lot more depth than Incan Gold/Diamant, because of the paranoia introduced by the traitor element, and also because of the pseudo-cooperative nature of the game. The players sort of need to help each other get to the treasure before the cards run out, while trying to figure out the saboteur and taking steps to neutralize his efforts. Its plus is that it can handle up to 10 (!) players, which is an extremely rare attribute, but the downside is that this game takes a bit longer than Inca Gold/Diamant. Also, it does not tap into the schadenfreude that is the hallmark of Inca Gold/Diamant. Which is better? It is a matter of personal taste, and how much effort you want to put into the game. For a quick, brainless, yet fun party filler, it's Inca Gold/Diamant. For a substantive filler, it's Saboteur.

Great bluffing game of cooperation and backstabbing.  Scales incredibly well for a large number of players.  As with other card games, luck can sometimes be a factor as you are searching for a particular card to complete the path, although a good saboteur would make it as difficult as possible to connect everything up.  Eyes squint and accusations abound in this great light filler/gateway game.

RATING: 6
A simple introduction to the "hidden traitor" style of gaming that has been popular with several groups of new gamers. Much, MUCH shorter than something like BSG. There is technically some kind of score keeping mechanism but when we play all that matters is which side wins.

Because all virtually all play happens in the open it is much harder for the saboteurs to perform sabotage while remaining hidden. That is something BSG does much better. On the other hand, the deck is (relatively) small so there is less time for the miners to recover. I've played in games where the miners have technically lost with a dozen or so cards left to draw (because there is no remaining way to make the necessary connections) and that's a bit anticlimactic.

With 7-10 players this is probably a decent option (as there is the potential for 3 sabs).

I should use advanced rules: loyal dwarves with broken tools get no gold, put the center goal card an extra space away (to prevent a single tunnel card revealing two goal cards) and the saboteurs-in-cahoots rule (like Werewolf -- everyone closes their eyes, then the saboteurs open their eyes and see who each other are).

Can any game get a group of people more animated?  Suspicion, and "random" acts that fool everyone else...  Saboteurs feuding and sabotaging one another, only to win when one reveals themselves to the miners who come to he aid of the other saboteur at a critical time...

Playing the alternative rules means that only miners with unbroken tools share the gold - which leads to the miners sabotaging one another, to the joy of the saboteurs!

Is this game a "filler", or the highlight of the evening?

The outcome seems too heavily weighted on how many saboteurs there are; the swing between, say, 5v2 and 4v3 is immense. The main plus point for the game is that you can squeeze many players in, which makes it an OK filler for those occasions when you want everyone in a single game.

While the idea of combining Mafia-esque secret information with a map-building game sounds like a good idea in theory, in practice this one fell a little flat for me.  Unlike in Mafia, it's pretty much guaranteed that the Saboteur is going to be found out at some point (the game wouldn't last very long if they stayed hidden the whole time), and then it's basically a question of whether there's one or two Saboteurs.  If there's only one, it's practically impossible for him to stop the other players.  If there's two then they have a fighting chance.  Either way I didn't find the game to be very interesting.

This game is not super balanced as far as play goes, and depending on how many people are playing can favor one side (i.e. 4 players).  However that is not the best part of the game.  The unknown is the best part.  My favorite play was where we had four people and none of us turned out to be a saboteur, however we still managed to defeat ourselves because we thought that one another was a saboteur.  Great theme and very intriguing play.  But don't rely on mechanics or balance.

Saboteur is a fun little maze building game with some roles thrown in.  The only major complaint I have is about the difficulty in hiding your identity, and more importantly, winning as a saboteur.  It's hard to hold much against it though since it's meant to be a light, quick filler with shallow depth.  -Does its job.

After more play I've found this to be an excellent game.  With the right group this game can really shine.  The cards played can often be interpreted both ways, help or hurt, lying or telling the truth.  When two saboteurs can telegraph to each other early it makes for a really interesting round.

Good, light co-op game with a traitor mechanic.

Appears to be accessible to a wide-audience.

A tentative 7 after one play.  We actually went two of our three rounds with no traitor (which was a bit anti-climactic).  The round with the saboteur was a good learning experience and provided some pointers on how to play the role.  Look forward to giving this another go with what we learned.

OWNED SINCE 2012
This is a fun game for me and my family to play (wife and 5 kids ages 5-11 years of age and up). It is light and quick, and can be fun. My smallest one even enjoys it, although he is not always helpful to his team, lol. My children 9 and up have a good understanding of the game and contribute to their side. The only problem with this game, and it is a huge problem, is that it is impossible for the saboteurs to act without being suspected. This is a sort game and there is no time to be subtle, or else you jeopardize losing. If do not act fast you will lose as a Saboteur. The problem is Saboteurs almost always lose because of it. I have tried many times to like this game, but it is just too hard to win as a saboteur and it is no longer fun to try. My dis still like this game, and they can play without parental supervision. So that is nice. But I do not enjoy playing this game. I would just prefer to play other games.

I've played a number of games with 5 players and found Saboteur to be surprisingly engaging. The game seems to be well-balanced for 5 players. Finding out who is/are the saboteur(s) was the most interesting part of the game. But there was also a lot of tension towards the end of some rounds as it was far from clear whether the miners could find the gold. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.2
Light fun filler that requires the correct number of people to balance correctly.  I believe the ratio of miners to saboteurs the game rules dictates makes it too easy for the miners.  Here are my thoughts after two plays: with 6 players, use 5 miners and 3 saboteurs, deal each player one card, and remove two from the game.  Gave my copy to my cousin.

RATING: 4
Trying to stop the other players takes some trick in this game.  You really need to play like the miner for some of the game, and then sabotage them as they get closer, with less cards in the deck to stop you.  Plus if you make a move too quickly, everyone else will play their stopper cards on you.  It becomes a lot easier if there are multiple saboteurs in the same round, in that you can play off each other.

A wonderfully themed maze-building semi-cooperative card game with a sabotage element. Want a fast playing, fun card game that works well with 5-8 people?? ... this is that game. The expansion is a must because it eliminates a small design issue with the original game. The only real criticism is the game's scoring system which seems a bit wonky and doesn't accurately reward players.

RATING: 5
Light, funny game, but too simple not to get quickly bored with it.  I can see some plays might be exciting and hillarious, but it's not enough to offset bland ones.

Warning - the worst configuration is probably 4 players (3 good vs 1 bad). Saboteur has too tough task ahead of him then.

EDIT: The game seems unbalanced - saboteurs win very rarely.  And the players who are saboteurs less number of times have better scores.  That seems a rule...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is a nice inexpensive game for up to 10 people, not many can handle that number well. The game moves along at a good pace and stays interesting enough throughout to hold your interest. 

The fun comes in from the hidden roles and trying to deduce who is who, it is also cooperative and competitive at the same time. There are two teams that compete against each other and you need to try and figure out who is who asap, once you do you can hinder opponents and help your teammates. Screwage also adds to the fun here as you hand out broken tools to the opposing team members. 

Recommended for 6 to 10 people.

RATING: 5
As much as I enjoy hidden role games like Saboteur, I find it only works well at certain player counts (don't try to play this with three even though the box says otherwise) and the gameplay a bit too difficult for newcomers to fully grasp. This limits its table appeal mostly to larger groups of veteran players, which is a shame because it is a fun game where accusations fly and both sides have a legitimate shot of winning the round.

(I currently haven't been playing my copy as it is missing some cards that I'm trying to find).

it is great fun. the feeling is a little bit similar to werewolf, but this one is a real game, more interesting, and more fluent.

also it was a gift, if you could play a saboteur.

A game with some similarities to Miles Bourne, but the goal is to create a cave to a goal.  However, there may be saboteurs trying to stop everyone.  As a result, the game has a semicooperative feel where teams try to achieve their goal, but the winner is decided by who has the most goild at the end of 3 rounds.  The game is best with at least 5 people.

RATING: N/A
Note there is also an official variant (which we always play), where good dwarves that have broken tools at the end of the round do not receive gold if their side wins... this adds a lot more to the meta game, as often quite innocent dwarves have their equipment broken because they have already won "too much gold".

It seems evident from the percentages that the Saboteurs have the least chance of succeeding in 3, 4, 6, and 9 player games. For the most part, this is corroborated by the results in this thread:
Post your results: Win record of Gold-Diggers vs Saboteurs
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/164370

Especially in games with this number of players, perhaps the Saboteurs could use a slight edge to improve their chances. If you're finding that the Saboteurs don't have much hope of winning in 6, 8 9 player games, you should consider the Werewolf Variant suggested by Aaron Kurtz, where the Saboteurs secretly reveal themselves to each other at the start of the game. Details here:

Initial Rating: 5.0 (August 2010)

I love traitor mechanics, so I should like this game BUT I don´t. Not sure why but I don´t have any fun playing this and it is a shame because my game group like it fine. Perhaps I have an anti-chemistry with tile laying games (I also have an irrational hate for Carcassonne).

For me, the game is very light with low complexity (a minus for me), it has lots of meaningless decisions (either you have the right cards or not), an annoyingly high luck factor, paper thin theme and lots of accusations and “take that” moments (a plus for me but not enough). I feel the game is boring and I feel no desire to play it again (but probably will as many friends like it).

I have to say it seems the game is good enough to play with non-gamers and that’s about all the game has going for it.

This one is quickly becoming a favorite among my gaming group. It's not my favorite, because I think it's much harder to win as saboteur (especially more than once) than as gold-digger, but it's fun with a big group and the other players really seem to enjoy it. For my money, I prefer Diamant with a big group, but I usually don't turn down a game of this either. A quick filler-type game.

RATING: 4
Saboteur is a simple game that can be played entirely without communication. Hidden roles are given out at the start of the game, where players can either be a Dwarf or a Saboteur. The goal of the game is for the dwarves to reach the gold. Saboteurs try to prevent the dwarves from reaching the gold. Each turn, players play a card then draw a card. Cards are used to dig deeper into the mine, or to 'sabotage' other dwarves, gain information, etc. First dwarf team to the gold wins.

The game is not as 'social' as some others (i.e. The Resistance) and does not contain enough depth in gameplay to be compelling in the long term. However, for a quick, light, somewhat fun (occasionally funny, but not as much as I expect) game, you cannot go wrong* with Saboteur. 

*Unless you have been deliberately going the wrong way the whole time, in which case, you are going the right way.

Game worked quite well with 5 players.  Though it was tough for the saboteur if there was only 1 saboteur in play. Liked the way the gold nuggets were passed around counter-clockwise otherwise laying a card which allowed the next player to finish would have been a bad idea.  Needs players to talk and theorise about each others roles to liven up the game.

RATING: 8
Use cards to develop the path from entry to the gold -- but beware: at least one player is the saboteur, who gets the victory points for that round (of three) instead of the players. It's an interesting mechanic that certainly works... but it only really gets fun if non-saboteurs play like saboteurs. :P

It didn't matter if I was the saboteur or a normal dwarf... The other players still beat to death because of my suspicious moves.

First round, normal dwarf, trying to prevent us from going for the rock, others tought I was the saboteur and beat the hell out of me...
Second round, saboteur, again I was beaten to death even though I tried to help the dwarves to reach the rock...
Third round, normal dwarf, and some how, because of trying to fit a piece that I thought wouldn't hurt anyone and might prevent the saboteurs of playing against me, the other dwarves beat me together with the saboteur... So I ended up trying to beat everyone else.

Somehow I was also missing the cards to fix my equipment

RATING: 9
This game is a the best ice breaker/filler game I've played. It's easy to setup and you can explain everything within five minutes. The secret roles make the game interesting, and best of all it can handle up to 10 people.

I don't think this is the kind of game that you'd want to play over and over again (Bang! is probably better for that), but as a light filler game, with a very fast learning curve (which is lacking in Bang!) I think it's perfect and brings both gamers and non-gamers to the same table.

The bad part is once the dwarfs figure out the best strategy, the game becomes very hard for the Saboteurs to win. I might say it's broken with 6 players (4 Gold-Diggers and 2 Saboteurs)

I usually do not have a chance to play with 7 players, but I think it's the sweet spot.

Kortspil.
Dværge der graver efter guld i minerne.
Men der er måske en sabotør der prøver at forhindre de andre dværge om at nå ned til guldet, ved at ødelægge de andres hakker, vogne eller lygter eller simpelthen sprænge minen i luften.

Divertidisimo, y más divertido cuanta más gente juegue. Los enanos tratan de llegar a su pepita de oro cavando un tunel, pero hay algunos de ellos que son saboteadores, nadie sabe quienes son. El saboteador tiene que conseguir que se acabe el mazo de cartas antes de que descubran la pepita escondida.

Hidden roles are always kind of fun. This is a pretty good game for larger groups, and perhaps a good substitute next time someone calls for a party game like Apples to Apples or trivia-game-of-the-month. It's light, so I don't strive to win as much as just make it a fun social activity. I love how it breeds mistrust.

This is a great game for a large group.  Players are trying to achieve the goal while Saboteurs are working against them, however no one knows who is working with whom.  

Only problem with the original is that it is very (very) difficult playing as the saboteur.  However, everyone had a great time, win, lose, or draw.  

Playing time is about 30 minutes.

This is a good game to accommodate a large number of players, and seems very approachable for non-gamers.  In my (limited) experience, it's hard for the saboteurs to conceal themselves for too long, but it is possible for them to really hinder the game's progress.  As for the dwarves, the winning conditions are kind of strange, it seems like the gold should be distributed randomly.  It is fun for the players to accuse each other and provides a Werewolf/Mafia-like experience with a little more structured game.

Played for hours with some friends. Didn't know it and we all had a great time. Easy to explain, easy to learn and really funny.

The game for the saboteurs is really hard, even more if there is one of them. If there is more than one player playing as saboteur, it is a bit more easier (but it is still very hard to win).

Badly in need of some variants. This game has some nice concepts and really tries hard to bring some good mechanics together. In it's current format I don't think it's very enjoyable. I will reserve some judgement for play with a large group (though it might be too slow). Nice artwork and decent quality cards.

UPDATE: I've been playing this during luchtimes at work and at larger family gatherings. This is an excellent game lots of bluffing and suspicion involved. The game requires some modifications but look in the forums and you'll see some good variants that really balance and "make" the game.

A similar and perhaps better game is Kutchfahrt von Teufelsburg. Worth noting.

Friend owns this.  I really like hidden role games, but I'm not a huge fan of this one.  Gameplay seems really chaotic.  The cards that hamper other players (what I call "dick move" cards) are unfun. I get why they are in the game, but it sucks when you have several turns skipped just because you don't have the specific card that gets you out from someone's "dick move".

All in all.  I kind of enjoyed the couple of games I've played of this, but I could take it or leave it.

This game really shines with 7 players. It is just so much fun to get away as a saboteur and make the diggers accuse each other. It really got the game going when my group started to state if they found gold or coal during the peek under the goal cards, made it more fun for everyone.

Not necessarily a bad game, but somewhat boring. Right at the start it's possible to make something meaningless as a regular dwarf, but most of the cards seem to be rubbish most of the time. Changing the amount of saboteurs might of course change the game and bring some variance.

A decent offering if you want a game that accommodates lots of people (usually six is as high as they go). It's almost impossible to play well as a saboteur without revealing yourself, since a gold-digger never has to do worse than cycling a card. Using the variant that impeded diggers gain no gold may be necessary to give saboteurs a fair chance.

In an experienced game group, Saboteur will probably be to partyish.  In a large group of smart people, but not necessarily gamers, it is absolutely perfect.  The traitor aspect is central, but since the saboteur is sabotaging a tunnel rather than an individual, there are never any hurt feelings.

Saboteur can play with a huge number of people, and it's the one I always bust out as an ice-breaker when I have friends over!

Nagyon szórakoztató kártyajáték. Tetszik, hogy nem feltétlenül derül ki, hogy ki a szabotőr, főleg, ha valaki, akiről eddig azt hitted, hogy aranyásó, valami furcsát játszik ki. Meg tudja keverni a dolgokat. Fordítva is igaz, mert van, amikor egyértelműnek tűnik, hogy ki a szabotőr, aztán pedig valamelyik akciója után elbizonytalanodik az ember.
Véleményem szerint a szabotőrnek könnyebb dolga van, de eléggé kiegyensúlyozott a játék, mert az aranyásóknak is jó lehetőségük van nyerni.

A szabályok kicsit bő lére eresztve vannak megfogalmazva, szerintem lehetne rajta egyszerűsíteni, egyértelműsíteni.

Azt viszont egyáltalán nem értem, hogy ha már a doboz magyar, a játékleírás magyar, akkor a Saboteur szó miért nem szerepelhet magyarul a kártyákon? Azért a pár lapért feleslegesnek tartották? Természetesn nem zavaró, csak furcsa.

Megjegyzés: Játszottam 9 (meg én voltam a tizedik) 11 éves gyerekkel, és teljesen le voltak nyűgözve, imádták a játékot. azért ez sok plusz pont a javára! :D

We primarily play with 3 so this game didn't really work well for us.  I'm not sure I'd like it much better with more either though.  Ultimately the tunnel placement is much much more fun in a game like Karuba so that leaves the other elements.  Card play itself is a bit dull as its usually obvious what to play if your a miner.  Plus your hand gets cluttered up with stuff you really can't use if you don't know who the saboteur is or if there isn't one so your mostly just waiting to draw the needed card.  As the saboteur it's more interesting but I wouldn't say exciting.  And the whole broken/fix tools mechanic is a straight rip of the classic Mille Borne game which I loathe these days. I don't really care for the random draw of the gold cards when the miners win either. I do know a lot changes with the expansion but I bought this in 2016 new so apparently the publishers still think this game works as-is for the specified player count.  I'm not going to sync more money into a just ok game at this point.

This game is more fun with the optional rule that diggers don't get gold if they are broken down at the end.  The rule it allows for in-fighting among the team, as well as helping the saboteur since he can claim he's a normal digger just trying to get the most gold for himself.  Otherwise, it's too hard for the saboteur to win.

I have been changing my thoughts on this one for quite some time and, after quite a bunch of plays with different people, as well as different number of players, I've consolidated an opinion: it's silly, yes, it's light, yes, but it's fun.

The key mechanism of this one is the hidden roles. It also is its main drawback, as the game can be played wrong, tactically speaking. Being a "good" dwarf doesn't mean that you have to reach the gold at all costs: if you get the last pieces of gold, you'll be earning one while the first dwarf gains three or four. "Good" dwarves not only must try to reach the exit, they must try to get there first. The game is further enhanced if you play with a variant in which only the "good" dwarves with all their equipment intact get any gold. If "good" dwarves aren't trying to stop each other, if they aren't forming gangs, if they aren't divided in teams, you are playing the game in the way it's not particulary fun.

But if "good" dwarves start getting competitive, then Sabouteur becomes a very fun light card game that's great for large groups.

Filler card game for up to 10 players. Make sure to distribute the gold nuggets correctly (i.e. counterclockwise!), because otherwise the incentive to help the next player to reach the destination card is rather low.

Cool easy card game, something even grandma or the six-year old nephew could play.

There is one flaw, namely that it works better with some player numbers, and less so with others. It can be played with like 3-11 or so, but for example sucks with 7.

A lot of namecalling and nasty gameplay don't make this  a friendly game.

Very good and fun game for a large group. 7 seems to be the sweet spot: 4 vs. 3 or 5 vs. 2. I like to apply the optional rule: the gold cards are distributed only among the gold diggers whose tools are not broken. This rule virtually makes every player a saboteur.

Players take on the role of dwarves. As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold. Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.

With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the game.

RATING: 9
The best party game I have ever played. Collaborative with traitor element. Altough it is not very appealing if played with less than 5 players (what is not a issue: for that amount of people there is a large pool of also fast paced games that can be played), it shines when played with the right amount of people (5+). For me: a staple absolutely over the other games of its kind (werewolf, bang!, the resistance...).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like this semi-cooperative filler over the likes of Bang!.  Plays briskly for up to 10 plyrs. so there's enough here to try and figure out who is who (gold digger vs. saboteur), although you are somewhat limited by the hand you've been dealt.

When I read the description, I knew this card game would be a hit with the college crowd that I interact and game with the most.  While its a bit of a stretch, in some ways it is a miniature/card version of Shadows over Camelot and they really enjoy the traitor/saboteur concept.  Maybe its that whole "being evil" part despite being at a Christian College...:-)  Its great for large group play and as a filler and easy for people to learn.

Semi-cooperative deduction/negotiation game with passing similarities to Werewolf or The Resistance.  Not knowing how many saboteurs there are is a good twist.  Be interested to play enough to find out if the suggestion that it's tough to win as a saboteur is true.
After a few more plays, we're of the opinion it's almost impossible to win as a single saboteur, but with 2 of 5 it's almost evens

RATING: 8
This has been a staple of mine on BoardGameArena, along with Puerto Rico and Jaipur. I actually stumbled on Saboteur as I was bored waiting for Puerto Rico lobbies to open, or anyone to join my game, but man did this game exceed all expectations. It's a hidden-role game, and before you audibly groan I'll have you know I like hidden-role games, as evident by my interest in Cosmic Encounter, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, and Resistance/Avalon. But what's great about this game is that it combines this style with Carcassonne, where you're building a path to try and find the gold, unless you're the 'Saboteur' and you're trying to stop them from finding the gold. There's a bunch of cards to help you get there and make the path, and there's cards that stop people from building paths. There's cards to look at where the gold is, and cards to stop others from looking. There's cards to sabotage the path, and cards to stop that from happening, etc. Lots of options.

What really appeals to me about this game is that it's cheap, light, and while it is luck based it has one of the most intriguing game mechanics I have seen in a game as cheap as it is. This could very well have been $50 more and come with tiles and other crap, maybe a board, maybe some fancy artwork, but instead they made the game as simply as possible so that it fits in a small box very easily, can play on a small amount of space, and can be bought for extremely cheap, even at MSRP (maybe not extremely cheap, but still cheap in terms of board games). I can't wait to get this game and play it with my friends, and while none of them have played it they should pick it up easily and have a good time.

This small game came as a nice surprise. It was fun, light and quick with not too difficult rules. It appeared to be very replay-able as well and about anyone can join in.
Great part of the fun comes from the fact that every round there are 2 teams playing against each other but no-one knows how the teams are divided. This gives some pleasant tension and since teams change every round ...
I think it's a must have family game.

While getting your equipment broken can be really debilitating if you get unlucky with your card draws, this game is fast enough that that it doesn't decrease the fun of this game too much. I really like how did gold distribution for the non-saboteurs in this game, as it causes players to sometimes actually want to mess with the pathway regardless of their allegiance which may throw off who actually is the saboteur or not. At the same time since it is counter clockwise and play goes clockwise if you can help the next player complete the route getting second pick may be worth it.

Seems to be a more accessible group game (since 8 y/o is minimum age) than BANG and WEREWOLVES.

However, the kids at the convention will likely not be able to keep a secret. If they could, Werewolves and/or Traitor would be a game we could play. However, in contrast to what I just said, Saboteur plays with cards (and doesn't have heavy talking, to my knowledge, like the aforementioned games), therefore, it might work.

All that being said, Cash n Guns Live along with games like Wits and Wagers might might be the better use of time.

RATING: 7.3
This is a clever little game that serves excellent as a filler (have only tried it from 4 to 7 players and it scales well within this intervall). It defenitely grows with the number of play (between 10 and 15 so far) since the interaction and competitioin between miners grow for each play. 
In earlier games it was more clear cut divided sabuteurs against miners, now blocking and miners (and releasing them) is frequently part of the deduction and gambling tactics to be the among the ones who reach the gold nugget and are allowed to share the treasure. 
Saboteur roles also get more clever in hiding there role till it is necessary to reveal it to prevent miners from reaching their goal. 

All this also increases the fun of the game tremendously. It has really high replaybility since the distribution of roles differ from each play as do the the order the tunnels are placed. Of course it does not contain any deeper strategy but is very much up to tactical decissions and deduction. 

It plays quickly 20-30 minutes and almost always make me leave the gaming session with a smile on my face (no matter the outcome of the game).

In this game, how much you'll enjoy it pretty much only depends on who are you playing with. If you're playing with experienced board gamers who can bluff - this is going to be a hit. Also, the more people playing, the better.

The family loves it.  I'd like to try it with a group bigger than 4.

UPDATE - We played with six, and it was a blast!  There was more tension, more deception, and more fum for everyone.

UPDATE - I've been playing more aggressively, and taking more risks to maximize my chances to 'get the gold' first.  This has made the game more interesting.  

My wife was a successful Saboteur.  We never had this in a 3 player game since we started playing.  The fun is back!

For some reason, this game causes more stress than joy. It tends to go slow toward the end with a large group of people, especially if someone broke your cart or punched out your lights.

If you own this, you undoubtedly need to buy the expansion.
Without the expansion "Saboteur" seems a little unpolished. There is no real hand management and it's too luck based. You can get really stuck at times with no help from your hand or your teammates. Bluffing is, also, a joke with only two roles. 
Maybe with 5+ players the game gets better - I have only played it with 3-4.

"Saboteur 2" fixes everything of the above.

I have played with 4, and it is no doubt a fun game of back-stabbing and bluffing, but this game would be even better with more. With 4 players you only have the chance of one saboteur...and it makes it tough to mix things up with the group without being pegged as the saboteur.

Short card/tile laying game for up to 10 people. Cooperate with the other dwarfs to dig tunnels to reach the gold, or if you are a saboteur, to prevent the gold being reached. Mechanics are very easy, but it's a lot about bluff, accusation and suspicion. Lots of blocking and back stabbing.

I haven't cracked this nut yet. It seems too difficult to win against whoever lucks into not ever being a saboteur, and too hard to win as the saboteurs in general -- but it's a pretty fun game.

I like the tension of not knowing who's who, and the pleasure of being a saboteur and figuring out who your buddy is. It plays quickly, but doesn't end too soon; a nice balance.

The biggest downside is the lack of a board -- it needs a board, as the careful positioning of the cards is integral to the game. As it doesn't come with one, we use a 3x3 square of felt to keep the cards from wiggling around too much.

A combination of annoyance at the components and less-than-fond memories of its gameplay, I sold it.

I just didn't find it particularly interesting, and you can end up in endless cycle of missing your turn (which, in larger groups, means you'll be waiting quite a while). To be fair, the owner of the game houseruled the ratio of traitors to regulars, so I think the balance was off.

Played 5-10 times. This one gets high marks for being a favourite when playing with 7 or more. It wins almost by default, since competition is not strong in that field.

Fun game with 6. Lots of banter and chit chat trying to figure out who is, and who is not, a saboteur! Great starter game.
Played again with 4. Not as much fun as the 6-plyr game, that is for sure! With 4, there is a chance for no saboteur. This game MUST have a saboteur or it just doesn't play well IMO. Played with 8. Two or three players were saboteurs more than once. Saboteurs had no luck in getting gold, even with the middle treasure card set one space further away from the ladder. Luckily I was never a sabo, but I still didn't win.

Help your team, sabotage the opposition, bluff one or both sides, or simply play randomly to confuse people.  

A very fun game, in which players are digging for gold and there are one or more hidden traitors in their midst who are trying to sabotage things.

The hidden traitor mechanic can lead to some excellent results. Like misleading a saboteur to make them think that you are a saboteur too when you're really working for the good guys. Or playing randomly just to mess with people.

Plays really quickly once people have the mechanics down. Very easy to teach and very fun.

I just don’t like this game much. On the good side, it’s fairly easy to teach and not too many rules. It does take up some space, but it’s cards so easy to do. It allows for a lot of people and doesn’t take long to play. The art is nice. It has multiple ways to get points and a fun “who the traitor” aspect. Bu t it just falls flat for me. The randomness of assignment and lack of control (especially in large games) is annoying. Don’t know, just doesn’t work for me.

Fun -- but we played it with four and it was obvious that it's not the optimal number.  Hopefully I'll get a chance to play this with 6 or more soon.

Edit 3/14: Finally played with 10 players & had a great time.  Upping my grade from 6.

I've played this a few times and it's fallen flat every time.  Nobody liked it.  I keep thinking it may be better with more players, or with a different group, but I don't think there's enough here to make it worth the effort of finding out.

I'd play it if others wanted to--so far nobody has.  It looks like it should be more fun than it actually is.

10/16/12 Played a five-player game, in which I was the lone saboteur. I found the game broken. I don't mind games with asymmetric forces. But if four get to play against one, then one better have some super power or he's toast. This game gives him none. I assume it relies on the diggers squabbling among themselves, and maybe just maybe, the saboteur can squeak through to the gold. On top of the game being broken it put a bad taste in my mouth by two rules omissions by the owner that pretty much exposed me as the saboteur when I was forced to ask about them. Hence, I hope I never see Saboteur again.

French. But no text on card. Good game. Nice little filler. I prefer when we play as many rounds as their are players. If not, most of the time, if a player won the first 2 rounds, it's almost sure he wins the game... But, it is still a very nice filler. Quick to learn, and easy to understand. Will only trade with saboteur 2 extension).

RATING: 7.5
I didn't like this game at first.  In fact, the likelihood of the Saboteur(s) winning seemed so small that it almost felt broken.  Then a friend mentioned he ALWAYS plays with the following two variants: 1. The center goal card is 1 additional space away (8 instead of 7 - the top and bottom are still 7); 2. If the non-saboteurs win, they only get to share in the gold if they have no remaining broken tools at the end.  Rule 2 is huge -- this causes the good dwarves to turn on each other towards the end and can make it harder to identify the saboteur.  It also keeps people from piling all their attack cards on the suspected saboteur - they want to save some to help get richer.  Much more fun, much better game now.  I also recommend playing with at least 5 to get the potential for 2 saboteurs.

(Only played with 4 people, so far.)  A neat little quick game that has some interesting player interactions.  Easy to get into and play.  Once you discover that the game is really not about the many "good" dwarves versus the "bad" dwarf, but actually each "good" dwarf can hose the other dwarves to his advantage, it gets a lot more interesting.  You then fight the   card stack AND the saboteur.  Perhaps if the payoffs were a little more dramatic, that would encourage this style of play, but I can see how you might want to just "be nice" with each other.  Not being nice is a lot more fun though!  "Bang!" is superior, but this one is a nice change of pace for a large crowd.

Fun co-operative dungeon building game.

RATING: 7.5
Game in a Nutshell: Play as gnomes digging in a mine for gold. While some players are working their way to the gold, a secret few are working against their efforts.

Played as: 7,8,9,10 player

Played with: Vanilla, and With Saboteur 2

Pros: Best game I’ve played out there for getting people up out of their seats and pointing fingers and shouting accusations (always in good spirit). The interaction is ace. I love the crafty grin on the face of a hidden saboteur when they slyly (or not so slyly) reveal themselves by laying (or slamming) down a card that blocks the path of the hard working gnomes. The game matures like a fine wine as players get more plays in and play with a finer finesse. Overall, it’s a light, quick to play, easy to introduce game that fits a decent sized group.

Cons: Even though I haven’t had this problem yet, player interaction games often depend on the players at the table.  If you have the type of people who want to sit in quiet contemplation, this game won’t go over well. Also, it’s not going to satisfy people looking to have a lot of control in a game, as the winner never seems like it is the one who played the best game and hardly matters very much. I wouldn’t want to overplay this game; it’s a blast to bring out on occasion, but could easily go stale when played too much. 

Other: This game just flat trumped Bang; at least with a bigger group (6-10 players). It fits that same niche but lacks player elimination, and gains a clearer goal with a far quicker pace.  I think it’s important that players understand the skill in this game comes more from playing the players, not playing the cards. I've enjoyed this more as an experience then a game, but I believe the expansion helps bring more of a game-y element into the mix. 

Best Use: Great game for a large-ish group with all types of players (though the rowdier the better).

RATING: 7
Very enjoyable and simple role deduction game with a traitor mechanic. I'm usually always up to play this game especially since the saboteur and miner roles are balanced fairly well (miners should play greedily because of the scoring rules so anyone that hurts you is not necessarily a saboteur). The only issue I have is that scoring is played in 3 rounds which means that if you have an awful 2 rounds then you usually have no chance of a comeback. I would suggest for a more appropriate way of averaging scores to go up to 5 rounds instead, though 3 rounds is perfect for a length of a game so it's up to the group.

Juego sencillo ideal para jugar cuando el grupo de jugadores es amplio (hasta 10). Se explica en minutos y su mecánica es bien sencilla. Es ideal para reuniones familiares y el hecho de que algunos jugadores juegan en contra del resto sin que se sepa quienes son añade cierta paranoia generalizada que puede llevar a pagar los platos rotos a jugadores inocentes. Risas aseguradas. Aunque al final, se hace un poco repetitivo. Ideal para grupos con gente no muy "jugona".

Simple, plays fast, some tension in trying to figure out who is the saboteur. A couple of rules tweak make this even better (eg. can't discard cards). Not a big fan of the "milles bornes" cards, it really sucks to have several turns of 'draw, pass' action.

Multi-player game that's easy to learn and can be played withing 30 minutes.  However, I thought it was too difficult to control the scoring.  I only played one game with 3-rounds so my rating may go up.  The other strange thing was we played with 5 players & only had one saboteur each round, making it nearly impossible for the saboteur to win.  I liked the tension but our group didn't have enough "team" interaction. I've now played 6 rounds & haven't seen the saboteurs win yet.

Looking forward to playing with larger group.

Now played with a group of 8 (8->75 yo) with the werewolf variant, and the 'need gear intact rule'. Fun Fun Fun! Accusations flying all over. Saboteurs won twice. Everyone had so much fun that an hour after the game someone asked: 'but who actually won?' and nobody knew, but everyone kept on discussing how the game went.

I actually played this almost a dozen times, but oddly, every time was as a solo game.

We tried this once when a friend bought it.  There were three of us and we thought it was really lame.  Now I had a chance to play with five players and we had a blast.  It's a fun, short game for a large group.  I've since picked up a copy myself.  I don't know how much room there is for bluffing when you're the saboteur.  So many people have enjoyed the game, though, that I'm glad I own it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Technically maybe not the most perfect game, but it is fun. A lot of backstabbing potential. The biggest problem is that your success as saboteur often critically depends on how many other saboteurs there are; for instance, in a 4 player game there is only 1 saboteur, and you'll have a really hard time. Add a second though, and the saboteurs will always win. It works best with more players so that the balance is not so delicate.

In this card game, players play gnomes digging in tunnels trying to reach the gold. However, hidden amongst the group are the saboteurs! Their goal is to stop the gnomes from getting the gold. An extremely fun game that has always been a big hit with all the people I’ve introduced it to. It's slightly dependent on your group as players must have good bluffing/negotiation skills and enjoy a little back-stabbing. This game gets a lot of table time with my groups and I've used it as a "gateway" to more complex fares. Highly recommended!

Like to accuse my friends of being saboteurs, but I am not always in the mood for this loud type of gaming.

The rule that you only get gold when you have no broken tools brings the game to a higher level. This makes it useful to sabotage your fellow gold seekers. But the scoring mechanism in general fails to make this a tense game.

RATING: 4
I disliked this game right off the bat when I first played it a few years ago. Played it again recently, and my opinion has not changed. There's just no way to play with any subtlety as a saboteur, at least not if you want to have any chance of winning. So either the saboteurs underplay their hands and just silently lose while hoping for the perfect time to strike (which never happens), or they out themselves early, and by the 3rd or 4th round, it's stinkingly obvious who the saboteurs are, and the game just turns into a boring tug-o-war between the miners and the saboteurs, which the miners will usually win just because there's more of them, and it's easy to cripple the saboteurs by breaking their equipment. The end result is that every game of Saboteur is just way too predictable, paint-by-the-numbers, and completely lacking in any sort of tension.

RATING: 5.5
Are your friends sabotaging your attempts to dig gold? Are they telling the truth about what their map has revealed? A game of secret identities, with two important differences from The Resistance: (1) the saboteurs don't know who the other saboteurs are (or even if there are any other saboteurs) and (2) actions are largely transparent, so it's much harder to shift blame and sow doubt as a saboteur. A bit too luck-based, but a fun diversion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.1
A fun filler where the traitors can revel in being traitors - rather than just hiding and trying to blend in.  We prefer it with a rule from the expansion:  drop 2 cards to get rid of a broken equipment. That makes it feel less stifling.

RATING: 5
I loved this at first, but after a few plays I'm growing lukewarm.  A good game for a large group and a fun filler, but it's pretty hard to win if you are a saboteur, especially if your fellow saboteurs don't play a good game.  Which means that the outcome is basically random.  Might be much less random with the right group, but I'll probably never play with those people.

Két féle szerepkör van, az aranyásók, és a szabotőrök. Az aranyásóknak el kell jutni utakat kialakítva az aranyhoz, míg a szabotőröknek ezt meg kell akadályozniuk. A szerepkörök eleinte titkosak, ám 1-2 kör után mindenkiről tudni lehet, hogy micsoda. Sajnos ha kevesen vagyunk a játék elég kiegyenlítetlen.

RATING: 6.5
Die Spieler sind Zwerge, die in Tunneln nach Gold graben. Dabei arbeiten die Spieler im Team zusammen, es sei denn es gibt einen Saboteur unter ihnen. Die Spieler legen nacheinander Karten, auf denen Tunnelgänge zu sehen sind. Dabei müssen sie sich zu den drei Schatzkarten vorarbeiten. Mit bestimmten Karten kann man den Mitspieler ausbremsen, wenn man die Vermutung hat, er ist der Saboteur. An sich ein witziges Spiel, jedoch hat der Saboteur hier nicht viele Möglichkeiten zu agieren. Er muss im Prinzip bis zum Schluss mitspielen, da er sonst zu leicht ausgebremst wird.

This is a great game for a large group of players (up to 10). The game is a combination of bluffing and strategy between the good dwarves and the bad dwarves (saboteurs). Problem is, nobody knows who are the good dwarves and who are the saboteurs. The good dwarves need to build a path to a gold nugget treasure while the saboteurs tries to stop them. The artwork is nice and the card stock very durable.

RATING: 6
Not at all sure about this one.  

Maybe I was missing something but it seems very difficult for the bad guy to win, especially if there's only one in a large group, in which case I would say it's near-impossible and ends up boring. - oh, my cart/pick/lamp is broke and I cannot repair it since there are no more cards.  Hmmmm...

Okay - updated my rating after a second play - it is indeed possible for a single sabateur to win - it's all about timing and gettign the right cards in your hand before you do something too obvious.  There's also an incentive for the good miners to look bad - trying to be first to the gold, so it's not so clear-cut.

...update after third session: Gets better with more players and more beer!

Это эдакий семейный, более казуальный Bang! Тоже есть скрытые роли, тоже — хорошие против плохих. Отличия: 1) тема мирная и нет вынесения игроков; 2) Правила в несколько раз проще, я бы даже сказал — примитивнее, нет особых свойств персонажей, типов карт — раз, два и обчёлся.
Игра настолько хаотичная, что играть ради результата здесь не имеет смысла. Главное — удовольствие от процесса.

Fun filler game that distills down a traitor game into about 5-10 minutes per round. I think it's difficult to win for the traitor unless you're willing to reveal yourself at the most opportune moments. This game can be incredibly random and spiteful, but I think it works well as a filler/training wheels version of Shadows Over Camelot or BSG.

If you like traitor/hidden role games this is a great short one for quick play. Rather difficult to win as the saboteur, but the misleading and random accusations amongst players is always fun. Especially if there isn't a saboteur that round.

Hard to find games that work with 6+, are language independent, don't have player elimination, are easy to teach, and have more than one thing going on.  Saboteur manages all of that.  It isn't amazing or anything, but to quote the old Mac ads, "it just works." A little bit of bluffing, a little bit of puzzle (fitting the maze pieces together), a little bit of strategy (e.g., when to play a particular card), and it doesn't overstay its welcome.  Price to experience, a very solid game.

Nice lighter social deduction game. You can feel like the card draw leaves you without options at times, and a traitor can reveal themselves perhaps a little too easily, but as long as no-one takes it too seriously, still a little fun. Perhaps lasts a little longer than it should, but perhaps not so much of a problem if players don't deliberate over their turns.

This is a card game with hidden roles.  Saying that that makes it "Bang! Lite" is like saying that Carcassonne is "Tigris & Euphrates Lite" because it's a tile-placing game with wooden bits.  Saboteur is based upon route-building rather than player elimination, and is a faster, more enjoyable, and flat-out better game than the wretched Bang!.

Similar to games like Avalon and Resistance, where some players are saboteurs working against the other players. Only one player can win, however, so you don't win as a team.

This one is a great intro game, and great for team play, social settings, light game lovers.  There just isn't enough going on for the saboteurs to hide and be effective at the same time.

The game of cooperation with a/some traitor(s). This game works rather well with 6-8 players. Probably best played when there is exactly 6 with 2 traitors (you might want to take you one reg. gold digger card from the selection). Doesn't really work with Amigo rules with 3-4 players. It might work if you use a rule from Z-man games (where gold diggers with broken tool won't get gold if they win) but I haven't tested and I'm pretty sure I have other games to play with 3-5 players. This is a game to play when you have too many players for other games.

Play as Dwarves tunnelling to gold, but beware, there may be a traitor in your midst!  High tension and high laughs combine to make an enjoyable experience.  Work cooperatively to foil the traitor and gain the gold.  Have fun as the saboteur by preventing the other Dwarves from getting to the riches. A fun card game that can take up to 10 players.  I suspect this would be more fun the more people you have.  After a few plays I feel there is a problem with the scoring system though.

Quicker than the other traitor games, which is a plus.  But I'd much rather play one of the others instead, there is just so much more to them.  This is light and easy to teach though, so it definately distinguishes itself.  It seems to play better with larger numbers, and it's cool that it can accomodate 10 players, which few games can do.


Update:  It had been awhile since I'd played but It has really dropped for me.  It's really hard for the Saboteurs to win, it seems like there aren't a ton of options, and I hate the way gold is given out.

Played once and instantly enjoyed it. Friends adored it too, considering they aren't serious gamers. Wanna try it in a party setting though. *Update* Really hard to play and win as the saboteur. Played 3 consecutive games with the saboteurs losing all. Took the game down a notch for me. **Update** Back up to being one of my favourites again after having fixed the number of saboteurs and doing away with the gold nuggets. All whom I've introduced the game to have adored it.

i really wanted to like this game, it's simple, it does not take forever, the theme is fun but the ending to each round is really not well thought. for me, picking the miner kills the game almost instantly. essentially everybody who is a miner wants to place the last card since that enables you to pick most of the gold (other miners than pick in the order they were seated). that is supposed to create tension and you have to decide between helping your team and maybe receive some gold, or let the saboteurs have it. the problem is, in games with larger groups everybody keeps 2 cards distance from the gold, so when you decide that you will place a card that helps your team, player going after you will take it. this means that the person who helped the most in reaching your common goal with get the least out of it. (or maybe i am wrong and this game is really some deep philosophical message about how life works according to the designers :)) in the end, nobody wants to do that, everybody stalls in the final phase and that is just not fun.

Not a classic in the vein of 6 Nimmt, but an engaging little card game that's primary claim to fame is its ability to accommodate up to 10 (!) people.  After playing it with 9, it does seem like it works with that many, which is a nice niche in the collection to be able to fill.  It's thematically well done, too.  The gameplay is sort of a cross between Waterworks and Mille Bornes, but manages to be neither.  Too bad it's import only.

A nice party game. Always a blast guessing who are the bad guys. : )

When playing it with the right crowd, I'd rate this game a 9.
With wrong crowd, the rating drops dramatically.

Suggestion: Play this game with clones of Spock (from Star Trek.) Then this mind bending and manuplating game could be really really deep.

GF doesn't really like it as she's not good at manipulating mind. :D (Now that's good isn't it!)

心得:壞人難獲勝，主要是一開始沒理由禁止其他人，好人不內鬨難贏
但是最後是比金塊最多的獲勝，又跟總抽到的金塊牌有關，
運氣成分應該是較大的陣營遊戲。

◆八人遊戲：3個妨礙者與6個挖金人
◆九人遊戲：3個妨礙者與7個挖金人
◆十人遊戲：所有的矮人卡
● 依遊戲人數發予每位玩家手牌。
   3-5名玩家：6張
   6-7名玩家：5張
   8-10名玩家：4張
*形成一個5*9的卡牌陣列，3-1放起始通道，9-1,3,5放三張蓋的終點卡
*輪流做一個行動 之後抽一張卡
出坑道卡 前面不能有阻礙卡，要能合法相連到場上其他坑道卡
出行動卡
棄牌略過 蓋著棄一張

*障礙卡同種在一個人前只能一張
遊戲在以下兩種情況立即結束：
1.若翻出的終點卡上出現的是金塊，由好人獲勝。
2.當所有玩家手牌用盡或是無牌可出，由壞人獲勝。

*好人獲勝，抽出金塊卡張數等於玩家人數，在所有好人*逆時鐘*分
*當10人遊戲時，只會發放9張金塊卡。

A fine time with 6 or 7 players, with accusations and counter-accusations flying around the table. A simply path laying card game from the mine entrance to one of three possible gold destinations; only there's 2 or 3 secret saboteurs (who can't afford to reveal themselves too early but will at some point when the path's getting too close) trying to
derail the building plans. Quick enough so that getting stuck on one round isn't too frustrating, good enough to have fun regardless.

Nice little hidden roles card game, where u take control of a dwarf tunnelling their way to gold or are u? Some dwarf roles are saboteurs and they try to derail the gold finding mission, if the saboteurs successfully foul things up they take the gold themselves otherwise the dwarfs share it. Neat simple fun game, works well with kids and who doesn't love being a sneak (Saboteur) every now and then? ;-)

Cool, Quick-ish, Med-Light, Semi-Coop, Hand-Management Exploration Card Game by Frederic Moyersoen. 

Easy to teach and learn. Feel of gameplay becomes intuitive after a few rounds of play. Good for younger folk, too.

Both sides, the miners and the saboteurs, must work together to effectively accomplish their goals.

I love that the saboteurs don't know who the other saboteurs are at the beginning of the rounds.

Family Game. Group Game (up to 10 players).

A fun card game. Those mining dwarfs are funny. Either the good guys (majority) or, depending on the number of players, non, or more (but alway minority) saboteurs to spoil the game to the good guys. It's nothing overly original but it's a fun starter to get the players into the mood of backstabbing games like Intrigue, Mall of Horror, Kutschfahrt or SoC for example.

End of night, people were really into this. Arguing about who the saboteur was. Fun for all.

This could get bumped higher than initial 7.5

A nice secret identity game, where good players are trying to build a path to find gold and the bad players are trying to secretly sabotage said path. The deck acts as the timer and if the path is incomplete when the deck is empty the saboteurs win. Though it's a little easier to figure out who the traitors are when compared to games like one night werewolf or the resistance, the difference is that knowing is not always enough to win. 

The good team must still work semi-cooperatively together and actively target the traitors. Generally though, this game often falls over in groups I play with, because people do not realize that this game is supposed to be played semi-coperatively (not fully cooperatively). 

If you are on the good team, it's not just about your team winning, it's just as important that YOU are the person in the team to actually REACH the gold. People who get to the gold FIRST generally get more gold than their team mates who may have helped out along the way.

In my 3 plays with 4 players I found it to be frustrating because the player in the role of saboteur was helpless. There is no way he can succeed with 3 opponents. when played with more players, ratio favors saboteurs more so it might be better. Also, there was a situation where a player cannot do anything but draw tiles for dozen of rounds, as other players blocked him thinking he was the saboteur. Bad game.

RATING: 6.5
A cute game. You have to build a trail to find the gold which can be one of three cards (which are hidden). Yet there is a catch, one of the players may be a saboteur, trying to stop you from getting the gold. Also, the player you places the last card that reaches the gold, gets an extra reward. The problem is that being the saboteur is very hard. It is too obvious and there are too many cards so you almost always get to the gold. Your only chance as the saboteur is if the players fight for the last card placement. Still fun and plays with any number from 3 to 10 players.

I was never really a big fan of games where you have to keep your identity secret--I'm quiet, and it tends to make people think I'm a liar.  If the saboteurs end up drawing a bunch of the cards that advance you toward the gold, then it makes it pretty much impossible for the dwarves to win.  Being stuck because someone played a bad card on you is really not any fun either.

It's a fun game where you can play cards to hinder people and try to guess who's on whose team.  I liked the variable roles and teams between games.  

My main concerns is that it seems the sabetours win more often, it's easy to guess people's roles, people can be stuck on a hazard/whammy, and the gold distribution for the winners isn't too fair.

Hidden roles/deduction game. It works only with 6 or more players (unlike the box says: from 3 to 10). For beginners it's very hard to win with the saboteurs, but with expert players it could be a great fight for the treasure.

After just a few plays, the game seems more fun for the saboteur than for the dwarves. I am ho-hum towards this one, the kids like it so far and my wife, who doesn't like most of our games, says she is interested in playing. She gets turned off by complicated scoring systems and enjoys the straightforward objective of this game.

I've only had a 4-player game so that may twist my opinion a bit. The game was an ok time-consumer but nothing more. You get cards and on your turn either play one or discard one, in the end of your turn you draw one card.

There's also three different ways to harm the play of the others. Back-stabbing isn't a rule though, but still it's something you just have to do to your suspects. The problem with 4 players is that there is only one saboteur, so your efforts to bluff are mainly in vain.

A little too much Bangy to my taste.

I recently just increased my rating on this because it really does matter who you're playing with. I think this is a great light game. Cheap too! 

3/11/13 - After some more plays I think I almost prefer this without the expansion. The expansion adds lots of roles and new tiles but it kind of takes away from the Saboteur aspect of the game since there are a ton of other characters you have to worry about. In the base game, all you cared about was getting to the gold. In the expansion you have to worry about the gold, the crystals, people stealing your gold, people switching roles, and just other stuff. I like the original. I'm bumping to an 8 and lowering the expansion to 7.5

Great party game especially when people are involved in play and a lot happens above the table and not only on it. There is lot of fun playing it, when everyone is accusing everyone of being saboteur.

This game is especially liked by non-players. Also the range off players number is great: 3-8. It can be played even in larger groups.

Although funny, the game seems to be a bit unbalanced as usually being one and only saboteur against four or five builders means no chance for winning. Probably this is why the game is played three times before the point scoring. Game is quite random too.

A tile laying game that uses cards (instead of tiles). This is a pretty great gateway game for large groups, espcially if they like semi-cooperative games -- players play in teams, but they don't necessarily know who is on thier team. Quick to learn and quick to play. Of all the super short fillers, this one is actually not bad. A bit old; if it came out know, it'd be called a "micro-game"

I like co-op traitor mechanics, but BSG and Shadows Over Camelot are long games that are challenging to bring non-gamers into. Besides, they bog down with 7+ players I've enjoyed The Resistance, but felt like it needed more of a quest/plot. Saboteur fits that bill of being in the middle. It's light, but there's an ongoing quest of trail-making for people to sabotage or persevere. But it's never too complex. It may even trump The Resistance, because it offers a little more strategy besides metagaming.

RATING: 7
Another popular filler game. PLaying with larger numbers of players is very different from playing in a small group as the saboteurs need to start sabotage earlier, thus outting themselves.

RATING: 8
Quick card game with secret roles that plays up to 10 players, and actually plays well with many players. Can be great fun with a group that knows each other well, as the players try to deduce which of them may be on each of the 2 sides.

NOTE: Rules aren't clear on this point, but designer has confirmed that any card placed in the map must be able to trace a path back to the start card. So for example, a cave-in must be repaired before the path can continue. See...
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/24487

NOTE: There is a Greedy Dwarf variant which helps to add some competition between non-saboteurs since only players with no broken tools when the gold is found receive a share of the points.

NOTE: A possible variant to avoid 2 goal cards being revealed by a single crossroads path card - simply place the middle goal card one space further away from the start.

SOME GOOD VARIANTS HERE...

This is after two plays.  I love this game!  It was cute and fun, and very very social.  My only complaint is that you have to place the entrance 7 card lengths away from the gold/coal cards and those one away from each other.  It was a paint to set up and I would have liked some sort of grid to help with the set up.

RATING: 6
Mining game which "claims" to play up to 10, but even with first playing with 7 was too chaotic. Not only are you at the mercy of the Mille Bornes style "take that" from opponents but also card draws can be frustrating. I can appreciate that team effort (once you've determined who's on your side) is required to overcome these complaints, but maybe with less players I would like it a little better. 

Update: Second playing with 7 has grown on me, as the importance of determining who's who becomes apparent. Have now played with a group of 8 who I've introduced Werewolf to in the past, and this was a more satisfying outing, with one round very quick and one down to the wire with 2 wins by the Saboteurs. An example of group dynamics and familiarity of game concept influencing the experience.

Egyszerű kártyajáték. A lényege annyi, hogy a törpék között vannak szabotőrök, akik minden áron szeretnék megakadályozni, hogy kincset találjon a "közösség". Ha ügyes a csapat, akkor az aknamunka ellenére mégis megtalálják az aranyat, ebben akciókártyák vannak a segítségükre (a szabotőrére is), ezekkel lehet blokkolni egy időre egy-egy játékost, amíg meg nem kapja a feloldó kártyát, illetve be lehet omlasztani járatot.
3-10 játékos játszhatja, kezdőknek is ajánlott, mert elég egyszerű a szabálya.

Wonderful social card game, especially for people who prefer lighter games. The cooperative play allows for easy decisions, except that not knowing who the saboteurs are makes people constantly second-guess their neighbor. Not much strategy. The gold scoring is a bit random (winning as the saboteur is probably too hard) but you should play this for the experience, and not worry about who wins or loses. Beautiful artwork on the cards. It's bets with lots of players, and great for non-gamers, because it's similar to Werewolf/Mafia.

We played this as a warm-up to Merchant of Venus.  With 4 people, the saboteur was at a severe disadvantage, and frankly, who "won" seemed entirely dependent on the person prior to the "winner" making a bad choice.  The art is nothing special and there's really not even a cursory attempt to find the saboteur whilst playing, which takes away the politicking fun of, say, The Resistance.  I'd return it, but I only paid 11 bucks for it, so it's not even worth the effort.

This game features hidden roles, sabotage, and some fairly simple gameplay. With four players there's a possibility each round that one person is a saboteur, and it seems to me that there may be hidden roles, but you sort out who is the traitor pretty much as soon as a conspicuously suspicious move is made. Then you just try and sandbag the traitor, and hope that you're first to the gold so you get a better share. Vos was a miner in the the first round, and a successful traitor in the second, and then we stopped. I think the game has more (but possibly less) potential with higher player counts adding more saboteur possibilities, but I'll have to take a look at the rules.

At first I thought I was going to dig it because of the hidden roles, the fast pace and the direct interaction.
But I got kind of disappointed. It's just too random and it's half the way between cooperative and competitive with a weird scoring system.
It's simple, and it's not bad but I'm not looking forward to the next time we play it (though I just played 3 and 4 player games, some say it gets much better with more players, it could be).

I admit, I am a bit spoiled when it comes to games involving a traitor, as I had the pleasure of being introduced to the mechanic through the brillian BSG. However, the prospect of a light filler/opener game including a traitor (Saboteur) intrigued me. The game plays simple and fast, as expected but the traitor mechanic is not very slick. Being the traitor and staying undetected is almost impossible and the "suspence" and "accusing" usually stops after a few turns, once it is settled who the traitor is, what follows is just a game of luck, because however holds the right cards, wins, all tactics and strategy is pretty much thrown overboard ( not that there was awfully much in the first place, but at least the traitor is thinking about how to remain undiscovered). We had fun, but it must be said that my gamegroup us very lively and as such we threw around quite a few accusations, but with the "wrong" kind of people, the gameplay can be rather stale. Again, a nice filler which is good in the face of a lacking alternative, but other than that, the novelty wears flat rather quickly.

Started a 5-player game while waiting for the rest of the group to arrive; did not finish the first round, let alone the game, but I saw enough to lose interest in it.  There are some interesting ideas in it, but as with all games where your available actions are limited to the cards you draw, limited even more by where those cards can be used (one or two places), and some cards are designed to limit a player's actions even more, I found it far too limiting.  Give me games with 100 choices at each moment and no clear-cut best choice, please.  This one isn't it. (Later watched a complete game, and became even less impressed, especially with the so-called scoring system.)

Really liked it when I first got it and when I have previously played it. It has fallen off over time especially because other hidden traitor games play better. The fact that you win as a team each round, but get different amounts of gold is kind of annoying. It is harder to get enough gold as the saboteurs also when you have nothing to do because you are stuck for multiple turns that is just not fun.Plus I have played this in 2 different instances where 2 different people actively and purposely played against their own team... not sure why this game brings that out in people.

RATING: 5
Reasonable filler and party game. An original take on the traitor genre games. However, it will only work well if people really grasp that winning is in the final score and not in each individual dig. If people don't get it (and don't get greedy as darwen minners should be!), the saboteurs won't stand a chance, the game will be seen as an unexciting one and the final result, random. Like most party games, the more players at the table, the merrier.

A light secret-role game, where a team of dwavfen miners are trying to reach the gold at the end of the mine, while some saboteurs are trying to thwart this. Since the roles are secret, there are lot of table-talk during the game. The illustrations are funny!

Small game. I love the concept of games where there is / might be a hidden traitor, because (me being a roleplayer and all) I have fun trying to bluff/con/cheat/lead/mislead others using everything at my disposal. This game, however, didn't cut it for me so far. It's relatively easy to tell who's a saboteur in our games, and there seems to be little advantage to being subtle; if other players block you, you can still block them in return and play those powerful cave-in cards at the worst possible time.

One of my very favourite 'simple' games. 

While it's true that the game 'plays itself' a little bit, this game still distils a lot of judgement and some nice squinting  "which player(s) is the traitor?" into a short and very portable format.

It's always quick enough not to outstay its welcome.

I'm a big fan, too, of how it gently encourages even allies to seem suspicious thanks to the way scoring happens. Only half of the battle is to be on the wiinning side - you'll still want to be THE dwarf who finds the gold, as that'll likely get you a better score. So you might delay playing your most helpful cards etc until YOU can use them rather than unil your team can.

It's no 'The Resistance: Avalon', which also comes in a small box and provides a superlative "who's the traitor?" experience. But The Resistance Avalon is longer and almost headache-inducingly meta/nuanced, whereas Saboteur is just a nice friendly game that you can play while talking about the weather.

RATING: 7
This game is perfect for larger groups wanting to warm up with a light game before moving on to something heavier.  With the right crowd you can get lots of laughs playing this game.  The right crowd would be people who delight in taking a role and playing it to the hilt without divulging to others who they are. When I play, I remind my group: "We're dwarves! Saboteur or not, we're greedy for gold! We'll do anything possible to get there first!"

If you like playing Werewolf or Mafia, you'll enjoy this game too.

I've seen others observe the potential for runaway leaders, and this has been my experience. But hey, this is a light game that can be played in a few minutes.  I just can't get that worked up about that problem.

That said, I do find one thing about the game irritating: why aren't the cards square?!  This one thing has bothered more people who play the game than anything else. Square cards can also help with the incongruities when trying to fit the 3 goal cards to the existing map.

The game's a lot of fun for the price. If you're looking for a crowd pleaser and want something different than Werewolf or Mafia, give this one a look.

This card game has some echos of bang (hidden roles) but is much quicker and players can't be eliminated. Good filler but how well it works is very dependent on the number of players and number of saboteurs vs miners. Excellent with more than four... one of my favourite fillers for larger groups.

(08/13/2014) - While purchasing The Resistance: Avalon on Amazon, this title came up as a recommended buy. I checked it out and gave it a whirl.

(09/11/2015) - [7.5] - Despite claiming to support three players, Saboteur should never be played with any less than five participants. With at least five players and usage of the optional gold withholding variant for loyal gnomes afflicted with sabotage cards, this is an easy and enjoyable title.

love the meta game - am not convinced the core game is optimal but need to play more

played more - rating gone from 7 to 8. base game is good enuff for lot of deception fun :) sure u have the occasional round of 3 where it doesnt quite work BUT u get a lot of rounds that are a lot of FUN!!

one downside - if u get broken early (eg u are a bad dwarf who needed to come out the naughty closet to slow the goodies down ) you can spend a long portion of the game doing nothing at all and that kinda sux esp for newish players

NB ive introduced this to a lot of non-gamers and they have ALL loved it - i have no idea why its not a lot higher rated than it is

RATING: 6
Plays nicely with large groups, but am a bit worried about the difficulty at some numbers for the saboteur to win.  But still nice for a lunch-time game or as an opening game for a gaming session while waiting for others.  Later plays continue to show that the person(s) who aren't saboteurs get more gold and win almost exclusively.  I wonder if the saboteurs shouldn't bluff at all, but just be vindictive from the start.

Excellent card game with a very attractive theme for me (the search for minerals inside a mine), but from a funny point of view, with miners vs. saboteurs. The expansion is very good and we prefer to play with it. IMHO, this is one of the best "hidden identity games" I know; at least, one of my favourite ones.

07-10-2014. Rated after 1 play. Ok game, in which you try to dig tunnels towards treasures. A couple of the players try to dig towards treasures truthfully, and a couple tries to make sure they never arrive there by digging tunnels towards other directions. You can screw other players, blocking them from digging tunnels. It's an ok game.. but better with a larger group which I do not really expect.

--Nov2010-- Amusing; light; fine change of pace from Diamant/Incan Gold (which, at least for the moment, I prefer.)  I'm not completely sanguine about the take-that aspect of the game; if there were a way for the Saboteur faction to play entirely by providing dead-ends in the excavation I'd find it more amusing.  But quite content to play as #2 son wants.

This game is, despite the partnership mechanic, dull and lame. The story is dull (a group of dwarves who dig and undig...), and the mechanics are lame (bluffing partnership, feels like random). And the lifeless board, modular though, does not raise my interest, too. My least favorite.

:thumbsup: Saboteur handles the hidden traitor mechanic in a really clever way. All players, even the non-saboteurs, are exhibiting traitorous behaviour because they want to be the first to reach the gold in order to score the most points and win. This makes it a bit less obvious who the real saboteur is.
:thumbsup: It’s a game that’s fast and fun at a high player count.
:thumbsup: Most people want to play again right away.

----

:thumbsdown: In the lower players counts, it’s hard to be the saboteur. Unless you’ve got a group of players who understand what makes this game shine and act like a trio (or quartet, or…) of shady dwarvers regardless of what their role card tells them.

Hidden roles are among the best game mechanics ever, and this one reduces a hidden-roles game to its basics. The saboteur doesn't have a lot of ways to really lead people astray, and there is little wiggle-room for errors. The gold-collecting aspect feels tacked-on to me.

An excellent light, quick card game, but probably one that requires the right group. The bluffing and doublethink aspects work very well. Probably the only traitor / negotiation / take that game I've encountered that would be suitable for sensitive petals.

A lot of the comments for this game say that it's difficult for the saboteurs to beat the miners. I think the idea is that some of the miners can help the saboteurs in order to bash the leader. It's not a team game; he with the most nuggets wins. Best with more players, but quite playable with 4.

Lightweight card game that plays fast with simple rules, but has plenty of room for strategy.  The traitors (saboteurs) can be difficult to identify, especially towards the end of a round when everyone starts breaking other players' equipment to get more gold.  Being the saboteur is intense and can be nerve-wracking with fewer players.  You can pick the right time to reveal yourself and just start trashing things, or you can be more subtle and sew doubt and start accusing others of being the saboteur.  The art is clean and effective, but nothing special.

In this cheap and very good game, players get roles that are kept secret.  Some of them are miners that want to achieve the gold.  Some others are saboteurs that will try to avoid that, for an unexplained and crafty reason.  Players can cave, demolish, see maps, destroy tools and repair them to fulfill their objective.  Very good choice for large groups.

There are good guys trying to get the gold before the saboteurs try to halt them from getting the gold. I feel like the mechanic of hiding your identity as a saboteur is lacking. It becomes blatantly obvious quickly in some games, which can be difficult for the saboteurs. Interesting concept, but flawed.

Kinda reminds me on Panic Station, meaning the game is mix of hidden roles and on the table play, this time in the version of building tunnels. Problem is similar, namely that roles are easy to figure out. Add on top of it is a pretty simple yet very strong take that element (locking other players) and there's not really much to do against it. A lot of it seems to be based on luck - which group gets which of the strong cards, how much saboteurs are present (+1 or -1). A part we haven't figured out yet is how egoistically should the good guys play (blocking persons from winning as they'd get the best cards). 

The game looks beautiful, is simple to pick up and is really affordable. However take that element of it is a bit clunky, slows the game down and frustrating at times. As for the story and narrative, yes it's there, but Panic Station does it better. 

EDIT: currently it falls down. Take that mechanic here just feels like stalling and there are many more exciting hidden role games out there.

Seems fun, or at least better than Bang! A little like Shadows Over Camelot and Mille Bornes.

A lot depends on how many saboteurs there are. Too many and it's impossible.

Also, I'm not overly thrilled with the scoring mechanisms.

Fast and nifty little game where you have a few miners trying to prevent the others from getting to the gold before the deck runs out. Landslides, broken tools, and tunnels dug in the wrong direction are ways that others can be... SABOTAGED.....

I am not a fan of the scoring mechanic. It's a borderline kingmaker, even though this is supposed to be a co-op game.

RATING: 5
In Saboteur, players seemingly work together to mine a route towards the gold deposit, but a traitor or two among them complicates matters. It's a quick and simple tile-laying game with a dash of treachery involved as action cards can be played to rein in players perceived to be on the opposing team.

My main reservation regarding Saboteur is that the capability to manoeuvre around in the game is largely dictated by the cards in a player's hand. A hand full of dead ends can easily lock a player out for the round as he desperately tries to convince others that [i]really[/i], he is indeed on the good side. As far as hidden role deduction games go, Saboteur is just alright, but outclassed by games like [thing=41114][/thing].

I agree with the sentiments that this game seems broken in favour of the gold diggers. The sabateur can really only slow things a little if at all, and then its really a bit of luck as to which digger gets to claim the gold. Really disappointed in this game. Not likely to play again.

Additional: I've re-rated this game, because first judgements can be wrong. I personally don't think it works with less than 6 players, so with any less than that I rate this game a 1. But 6 or morew gives the sabateurs a chance and makes it more challenging. Still only a 5 because it really isn't that exciting, but better than first thought.

RATING: 7
OK, first of all if you put aside all of its flaws the game is fun.  That's the thing to remember.  That said I sure wish there was a little more game here.  I enjoy this so much that I'm trying to find a balance to it so that the the winner isn't the player that draws the most gold digger cards.  Out of the box it is near impossible for the Saboteurs to win.

I was getting better results with the deposits 8 spaces away, now I think that the center deposit needs to be 9 spaces away and the two sides 8 spaces.  I also feel that there needs to always be one extra Saboteur thrown into the initial card mix.

Even still, it may be too tough for the Saboteurs...


If I can get it working I think it is a fantastic light map making card game where not everyone is working for the same side.  There is a traitor in our midst.  The payoff is high if you are the traitor, but sadly it is just too tough to pull off. With 5 players if there is only one traitor the game is impossibly stacked against him.  

Regardless, even if you are losing the tension is high, to complete the tunnel or sabotage it. I'm not sure if this game has any depth, but it brings quite a bit of fun.  Highly addictive gem that if it can be made to work it makes for a much better replacement to Bang.

As many gnome players as possible, you use your hand of cards to try to map a route to the treasure. Unless you are a saboteur.
Played over 3 rounds, I felt getting a result was out of my hands, and I had little control over what was happening. Still enjoyed it, played with about 10, though but the (pretty basic) rules weren't explained very well initially.
Enjoyed it more 2nd time I played it, with only 5, but still a lot of things are out of your control (no bad thing in some ways!)

Delicious lighter game, with fun intrigue between the saboteurs and the dwarves.  Overall, the game shines with an odd number of players, as an even number of players does not give enough saboteurs to give them a good chance.

UPDATE: Not an awesome game, but a good one to get a larger group involved. I'm not sure that an odd number of players is all that good, since a bunch of saboteurs can really throw things off.

UPDATE #2: Upon even further review, I just think that it's hard for the saboteurs to stop them with an even number, and so I'm not sure that it has quite the right balance.

I really like this small card game with hidden factions. If you're a dwarf, you have to be careful about placing the tunnels, if you're a saboteur, you try to make subtle obstacles in making the tunnels. You make a turn where practically it means that if you destroy the cross, it's very hard to replace it. But at first it doesn't look like you spoil the play of dwarves. Also you can talk your oponents out of thinking you're the saboteur. And it's quick. Love it. The only problem is when you get together with players who play clearly like a saboteur, but are actually dwarves. Usually other dwarves destroy his lamp, pickaxe and everything and you end up loosing as a dwarf. But even despite that I still love this game, wish it would be played more often in our group.

Not a bad game for large groups, resulting in some laughs over the identity of the saboteur(s).  I'm just generally not a big fan of group games without a true winner, although technically the player with the most gold wins here, but that is pretty random and doesn't really feel like a victory.  Still, it's alright once in a while if you have a larger group and nothing better to play.

RATING: 6
This game reminded me a lot of Mille Bornes but with a hidden role mechanic.  In this game players are each dwarves mining for gold.  Some dwarves are saboteurs however and they never want the other dwarves to find the gold.  Each turn a player plays one of the cards from their hand.  Most of these are path cards that they are trying to use to build a path to the gold.  Others break other players' equipment, repair broken equipment (these two reminded me the most of Mille Bornes), look at the goal cards to find the one with gold on it, or remove placed path cards.

Either the dwarves make it to the gold and each non-saboteur is rewarded or the deck runs out and the saboteurs are rewarded.  You do this for three rounds and the dwarf with the most gold wins.

The hidden role mechanics are kind of shallow.  There isn't a whole lot of meaningful opportunity to bluff in this game so the saboteurs are discovered reasonably early.  As a social game it is fine though, you do have a few decisions since you have a hand of 4 or more cards to work with each turn.  The one really crappy thing though is (and this is resolved in the expansion I believe) if you have equipment broken and never draw the appropriate repair card you can spend many turns just twiddling your thumbs.  This is exacerbated if you are the only saboteur since people will pile up tons of broken stuff on you to try and knock you out of the game completely.  Not very fun in that situation.

A traitor mechanic game where the play isn't centralized around determining who the traitor is, as much as it is tunneling as a team towards a common goal, with the traitors covertly and overtly trying to block.  Furthermore, as there are only a set number of treasure cards to be awarded if the diggers get to the goal, players can selfishly wait for the perfect opportunity to strike.  A very clever game, and with expansions that make teams, or narrow it down to a two-player game, this has a lot of versatility.  Plus each of the three rounds play fast, so it makes for a great filler.

Hey look, it's "Shadows Over Camelot Lite"!  It is another co-operative game with the twist of one or more potential "traitors" in your midst.  It even has a theme that fits quite well with the game play (rare for a card game!).  Of course, what really makes it interesting is that secret role selection, which means you are initially not sure who is working for you and who is working against you, much like real life dwarf gold miners.  The cards have fun illustrations (I actually like the backs of the cards better than the fronts) and the game comes in a very small, very portable box that can be slipped into your pocket and taken pretty much anywhere (except under water), even into a real gold mine.  The rules are simple and the game play is quick and deadly.  But, similarly to "Citadels" (another card game I enjoy), you'll need to get at least 3-4 players together in order to get the most out of this game.  And I recommend playing at least 5 rounds in order to decrease the chance of a player winning due to a lucky card draw or two.  "Hey! That's My Fish!" is still my favourite "filler" game, but with 5 or more players, this is the one to "dig" out.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7.5/10

In general, I don't like games with traitors. 
The only reason why it's not that bad, is that the traitor can reveal himself soon enough. Still, not my type of game.

This is a fun little filler card game that makes good use of a secret role (i.e., the saboteur) mechanic.  I also like the art on the cards, particularly the path cards with random objects strewn about the mine.  The rules are simple to learn and, if you have the right group, the social interaction can be good too.  Given that the game can accomodate a large group (I think up to 9) it's worth getting if you are hankering for a group-friendly filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Fast filler only interesting with a group of 4+.
Saboteurs try to spread chaos without beeing discovered while other players try to cooperate to mine gold.
Best part is everyone suspects everyone and even loyal players attack other loyal players because of greed, (The first player to reach the gold gets usually more gold than the others)

Ultra-light card game with little to no skill.  The only real fun to be had is figuring out who the saboteurs are.  To top it off, scoring it a total crapshoot.  Might be fun for a family with kids, but nothing really here for adults.

Saboteur should be a case study for modern would-be designers. Rather than the long, overwrought, everthing-but-the-kitchen-sink tons-of-exclusive-miniatures Kickstarter games du jour, Saboteur demonstrates that a co-operative game with complex interactions is achievable with just a deck of cards.

[Amigo Spiele 2004 Edition] {Party, gold digging; secret identity, partnership, tile-laying; optimal 7-10p} A nice and interesting party game.  Full of player interaction, intrigues and sabotage. It is usually easy to find out gold diggers and saboteurs. Therefore, some ground rules must be stated that players are not allowed to clearly tell which card they have.

Decisions are limited in Saboteur because of hand limit and events. I think 'rock-fall' is too powerful in some cases, esp. for the Saboteurs. Usually, the team holding the 'rock-fall' cards wins. Nevertheless, a good teamwork could increase win chance.

It's not clear in the rule about dividing nuggets when the Saboteurs win.  I choose this way to make the card distribution more even
- 4 saboteur: 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1
- 3 saboteur: 3, 2, 2, 1, 1
- 2 Saboteur: 3, 2, 1

Easily accessible and enjoyable game, taking on the hidden role of a dwarf or saboteurs searching for Gold. 

People always want to be the Saboteur but it require many plays to play well and win.

Harder still is managing the co-operation of the the dwarves hands. Most players start by setting up their fellow dwarves to complete the maze but soon realise that allies get more reward points than they do. 

You then need to advance in skills so that you scupper your allies by breaking their tools so they cant complete the maze. Only then does the game come to fruition in the way that it was designed to. 

Not many people reach this level of understanding or or can cope with this level of double crossing required against friend and foe.

It's a great game when it works though.

I'd give it an extra point if it had a mat.  I suppose it's fine without it.  We've only played this once and with 4 people.  It would be better with more saboteurs in the game rather than one required for a 4 player game.  No strategy yet, however after only playing once.  Everyone liked the game.  It looks like it will be a staple in the future.
UPDATE: After playing with 5 people and adding a saboteur, the saboteurs actually won two rounds.  We adapted the rules to let saboteurs win when the deck runs out, rather than when everyone in the group passes once.

Saboteur is a great secret role game.  It's very quick and works well with almost any number of players, although I've not played with more than 6 which I imagine gets a bit busy.  You get all the paranoia and tension of a game like BSG in about 10% of the time.

For $10, its quite hard to beat.  Plus, it's easy enough that kids can play.

This is a semi-cooperative game.  You're miners trying to dig a path to the gold.  However, there may be one or more saboteurs who is trying to hinder everyone else.  The game is played over 3 rounds, so the saboteurs are randomly drawn before each round.

My main criticism of this game is the lack of social interaction during play.  No communications is allowed and you have to deduce who may or may not be on your side.  The silent playing of cards during each round until it is over just turns me off.  I play games to socialise and this game hinders the social aspect of gaming.

Family game, but not one of my favorites.
My son likes it very much though so that's one reason to keep it. 

Hidden information is nice but doesn't work really well with the whole family. Also, the end is always rather predictable some turns before it ends as we tend not to focus that much on the individual gold nuggets but on the 'good guys' vs 'bad guys' thing.

Can see with a competitive crowd this becomes much better but then again, why would you play Saboteur with said crowd?

Maybe a 'gateway' game for competitive non-gamers.. but I tend to steer clear of those as these are normally fun-killers.

Will hold on to it until my kids no longer request it, then it will go.

I was hooked on this game and had some very enjoyable games with friends and frat-brothers. The main aspect why it fell from it's high place on my 'intrige/traitor' list is the imbalance. 
Taking out 1 aspect of another players set-up paralyses him. A lot of games ended in players drawing cards without being able to do anything. 

If you want a nice light intrige game I would suggest The Resistance to you. Altough the game is quite dificult to win as Resistance.

It's like a bad version of the Resistance. On the good side: it doesnt overstay its welcome and makes for a decent social experience. It accomodates quite a few players.  On the bad, whatever skill one displays, will often be wiped out by dumb luck. Luck of being on the winning side, luck of having some card played on you, luck of getting the right card. It's hard for a game to balance this stuff, here the randomness overpowers the skill as you often see brilliant bluffs going to waste. I dont think the multiple round format works, you collect gold if you can, each round and then see who has the most at the end.

Ever seen a movie that you enjoyed watching but wouldn't care to see again? That's Saboteur for me. The first few times we played (it's a very quick game), the game was a lot of fun, but it soon suffered from diminished returns in the fun department. I don't think Saboteur is a bad game by any stretch, but with so many games on the market, it didn't find a place in my collection.

tl;dr: fine family game

Believe it or not, but I had never played this game before now. It seems like everyone around me had and most of them like it but I never go to try it.
But now I have, and I must say I was completely blown away... by how it completely matched my expectations of an OK, but not very special family game.
The rules are simple (but badly written), there is some strategy, there is a good dose of luck and there is room for making plans that can fall to bits with just one card.
So yeah, fine game, does what it says on the box, but nothing extraordinary.

Playing this as a series of rounds is a lot more fun than single hands.

A good round can win the game for you, but it does enough good things that I can forget this.

Update: The imbalances in the game frustrate me more and more. It can become impossible to win if the person in the lead, going in to the final round, is on  your team. The small hand of cards and their relative use (or lack thereof) make it hard to have multiple ways to play the game.

Rating down from 7.4 to 6.5.

An ok traitor like game, I really like Avalon and Deception Murder in HK much much better than this though.  While Avalon and Deception allow you to really mislead players provided you don't give up your bluff, saboteur really just involves playing cards, which means it is more about the luck of your draw and how long until you want to play the first bad card on the other players.  Once you do, you are immediately singled out.  Unlike so many other traitor games where you can get into a grey area where people start accusing you and back your way out, you pretty much go from completely innocent to completely guilty in one card play.  I like the idea, but there are such great deception games out there that this really doesn't seem like it needs to be on my shelf.

Not a bad filler, but I don't think it has a long lifespan before we'll get sick of it.

Played with the variant that a dwarf that has broken equipment at the end doesn't share in the gold. This causes some dwarves to break another dwarf's stuff to prevent them from getting gold and hides who the saboteurs are a little. Plus, the fighting between dwarves helps the saboteurs out and makes for a close game. (Didn't try without the rule, so I don't know if the game is closer that without the rule)

I love this game!  Totally fun and chaotic.  Another one you don't really play to win - you just play for the sheer fun of it.  Has your classic cooperative / traitor concept - but great execution on it - and the roles change every round.  Also, each round only take 5-10 minutes so the pace is great and usually you get a chance to play both sides during a typical game.

Like werewolf, but it actually sees the table.  Lots of fun!  We play with a house rule for giving out gold at the end of the round.  Unfortunately, there is no way to be subtle when playing path cards (anything but a straight path at the start will get you accused).  Time and time again I think of making my own variants, because the game gets a little stale after a while.  Sometimes the cards you get dealt leave you with very little actual decision making during gameplay.

This was a very mediocre hidden traitor game. I would rather play The Resistance, Shadow Hunters, Werewolf or many others. In Saboteur it is very easy to get a bad hand for either side, once a Saboteur does something bad for the group they are instantly recognized and everyone just breaks their equipment and keeps digging. Sure both sides could win but with so little variety of cards the strategy is pretty much non existant, you know what is your best move and you will make it, it feels like your a computer running the code of the game rather than making strategic decisions.

This is a decent mostly cooperative game.  I wasn't crazy about the Mille Bournes rules, for example which allow you to break someone's pickaxe until they play a new pickaxe.

Probably my favorite hidden role game.  I like that there are more actions (a.k.a. data points) for you to use to determine the hidden roles instead of just bluffing and keeping a straight face, which is the primary feature in games like resistance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
It's quite simple in what you can do and what is strategically viable, and there is not a lot of room for the saboteur(s) to bluff; choosing when to reveal your role though is a crucial choice, and it's always fun as a saboteur when you receive a map. 

Because of the limitations it can also lead to some miners being viewed as saboteurs simply because they only have poor options, and I find that mechanic fun. But otherwise, I think there are better bluffing/social deduction games with more complexity of choices and depth of deception but this is good for a quick, easy game.

RATING: 4
Not my kind of game. This should be played by a large group (eight or more) and therefore downtime is big and any one player's influnece on the the proceedings is minimal. Worse yet, if someone plays a disaster card on you, you can spend the rest of the game literally doing nothing. The balance also seems off. In the eigbht-player games I've played, if there are three saboteurs, the miners have absolutely no chance of succeeding.

RATING: 7
Saboteur is a puffball of a game, but it provides a decent framework for social interaction among a large group of people.  Watching the tunnels grow across the tabletop is neat, but arguing about who might be the saboteur is hilarious (and the whole point).  Saboteur distills the best part of most semi-cooperatives into a fast-moving experience.

To me, this game is Bang!-lite. Although, it is difficult for people to understand that it is an Individual game with 3 rounds in which you are on a team. Gets a bonus for being a non elimination game.

I've always liked the idea of this game: you collectively build a path, but some people are trying to divert the path and hinder the other players.

There are a couple of issues, though. You're supposed to deal out the hidden roles and have one role leftover, so there could be one fewer saboteur. You need to houserule that the saboteurs are all in play, otherwise they have almost no chance of winning. The scoring also doesn't work. Starting with whoever ended the game, you start drafting cards that are worth 1-3 points. The people last in line will always just get one point based arbitrarily on seating order.

It seems like Saboteur would be perfect for today's audience with social deduction games being so prevalent. I would like to see this system tweaked and modernized a little (maybe add more roles), but as it stands it's just not a very good game.

1/8/12 - I bought this game for variety's sake. My family and friends enjoy The Resistance so much that I felt it would also work, while switching things up a bit. It's a good little game, but it was my mistake to think it would be anything like (or as good) as The Resistance. 

The biggest difference between the two is that in The Resistance, a spy character absolutely MUST play out the lie until the bitter end of the game. In Saboteur, the lie will only really last a couple rounds for some, and for the rest of the saboteurs, it rarely last longer than half the game. At certain points early on, it just becomes optimal for the Saboteur to make an obviously sabotaging move and give himself up, in order to best his chances for the win.

The game is still good. And I plan to keep it, BUT, only because the the younger kids in my family often BEG to play The Resistance. And in all honesty, The Resistance doesn't work well with children who don't understand fully the interactions and lying element of The Resistance. Enter Saboteur for those moments.

I have only played this with 9 or 10 players and it was good fun.

What I love about the game is that I could play with NINE or TEN players!

I love having a game in my collection that scales well from 5-10 people, easy to teach, portable and fun.

Update:  I have raised this from 6.5 to 7.  This is not so much because I like it more, but that every time I introduce it people have a good time.  This is a great quality for someone like me who often plays with non or casual gamers.

Update: I never want to play this anymore, so the rating goes down to 6. I give it a half point just because it plays up to 10 and is very portable.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 4

Excellent game. Can be very difficult as a Saboteur, but once the 'good' dwarves realize that they're really playing for themselves and not the group, it evens out mostly. With a midsize (5 or 6) group this can be great. Too few and it's more unbalanced. Too many and the wait between turns can drag a little. For a lighter filler, this is fantastic.

RATING: 7
Good game for a large group.  Get to the treasure, but who's trying to sabotage your efforts?  If you reach the treasure, the saboteurs get nothing, and everyone else divvies up the riches.  Otherwise, the saboteurs have succeeded, and they get the goods.  Fun game when you need a quick, interesting play with a lot of players (5 to 10).  Lots of flagrant table talk during the game as you try to figure out who's trying to sabotage the tunnels.

This is a good hidden-role game, a-la Bang, but player turns are MUCH MUCH quicker, keeping all players engaged.

Played an eight-player game of this recently and it was a lot of fun.

I used to like Saboteur better, but then I played better hidden role games. Here, if you're a Saboteur, it seems that it's very difficult to stay hidden and free of suspicion for more than one or two rounds, and if you do, you've basically thrown the game - most people will accept no excuse for not doing your best with digging the tunnel closer to the end points.

Ok, my first review of this game was a little too short. But it's one of the best games in our collection. Certainly considering the low price: 9,99 eur.
It plays very smooth and although it's actually not that difficult it's my experience that new players have a little struggle. But after 2 games they start playing well. 
When gaining experience you'll find different ways to sabotage the game. It's so much fun to deceive other players when they don't realize you're actually sabotaging the game. Sooo much fun!!!

It's like the Resistance with some strategy added and some lying and deduction removed. Lying almost does nothing, but I'm okay with that because I am a very bad liar. This game does not really need hidden roles, it would have worked pretty much the same had it been "good guys vs. bad guys".

Not a whole lot of "game", but good fun with a large enough group of not-too-serious gamers. I have the feeling that it is very hard to win being a saboteur, so if this "honor" befalls you 2 out of three rounds, your chance of winning is very small indeed. Still, I never mind as the game only takes 10 minutes per round with six, and there is a lot of bonding, bluffing, whining, pleading, shouting and pointing going on during that time. Good stuff when the group's in the right mood.

Game is a solid backstabbing genre. Though the game tries to be like bang, the decision making tree is simple enough. Like others in the forum, I find the game tends to favor the miners. Playing with some of the variants is necessary to balance the game.

Saboteur is a pretty good little game. I tried to read the rules to get a feel for the game before it came out, but the rules don't tell you squat about what the game is like. 

This game is like werewolf or bang, and the rules are just a means to an end. If you are a saboteur, you are trying to play bad cards or shift blame to other players and act like you are being forced to by the luck of the draw. If you are a regular player, you are trying to reach the gold hidden in one of three locations, and of course, try to find the saboteur and shut them down. 

The game plays very quickly, and normally consists of several rounds, but that makes it a good filler because you can adjust the length of the game to match, and no-one has to wait very long for you to finish.

RATING: 7
In the genre of good team vs. bad team, but this game adds actual tasks that need to be completed, rather than theoretical missions (See: Avalon/The Resistance). Another pro is that the game is played in three rounds, with different teams for each round, so a player can usually play both roles in a single game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A great game with some interaction between the players. Its fun trying to figure out who the saboteur is and its also fun trying to play the right crads so that you can get the most gold when a round is getting close to ending.

Light hearted maze building game with player interaction. Gets tense at times, but even the losers calm down at the start of the next round. The strategy is heavily dependant on the personalities of other players. Overall, very easy to learn, very fast to set up and play, and quite a satisfying play. If it were a big complex game, I would have gave it a 5 or 6, but it is a small box and simple game, it deserves an 8 for approachability.

Excellent little filler game, particularly if you have a pretty large group playing.  I've had some absolutely cracking Saboteur players, who you'd never have guessed were the Saboteur until they stuck the knife in! Probably plays better with a higher number of players, as if you just have one saboteur, I think it's pretty hard for them to win.

RATING: 4
I enjoyed my play, but there's just so little there.  With 8 players (considered one of the best numbers to play with), it is utterly trivial for the saboteurs to win every time there's 3 (67%).  There would need to be ~1-4 more horizontal pathways for the miners to have any chance in this situation.

The gold card mechanic is also terrible if you're playing a setup where it's possible for the miners to win.  Setting up the next player to complete a connection is horrifying: you're expecting about 1 nugget in this case versus 4 for the person that finished it.  It also has math that encourages it to be brutal - the worst cards are 3 times worse than the best card.  Simply shifting the cards to be 2/3/4 instead of 1/2/3 lowers the variance significantly while still leaving it random enough for the desired effect.

This game was a bit of a disappointment for me.  I love the premise, love the play style of laying out cards, love hidden role mechanics, but this was just lacking...

Unsatisfying play, either you have the cards or you don't.  Not much lying or deceit needed.  It's far too hard to win with the Saboteurs with most player-counts.  There aren't enough mechanics to keep things interesting.

Still an alright game that I'd play, but have a dozen other similarly priced games I'd rather go to now.

Semi-Update - Expansion looks to fix all of my "issues" I've reacquired and will be playing more.

interesting mix of secret identity/traitor within a simple card laying/path building game.

[+] easy to teach, short game, very tiny box, supports wide range of player count
[-] seems unballanced either way (considering 6p game, 1 vs 5 seems impossible for the traitor, whereas 2 vs 4 seems too easy for the traitors); for the traitor there's no real way to mess up the path without being discovered immediately

Two games, one with 8 players and another one with the expansion and 12 players.

For example following things do not create a great game in my opinion: Lack of control, huge downtime, fair amount of random, lack of choices. These are all nicely combined in the Saboteur.

I wonder if the game would be better with smaller number of players, but it would require a very sharp stick to force me to play this game again and try.

The idea itself is ok, but game play is not. Secret roles with different victory conditions is a good thing, building the tunnels is nice, but the end result is bad.

Great fun with a large crowd. Using the variant where the saboteurs know each other before the game starts (werewolf style) seems to help balance it. I also like the variant where the card directly across from the starting ladder is one further away. The good dwarves succeed too often for my liking, and afterall, the game is called Saboteur.

The players slip into the role of dwarves in the mine searching for gold. Suddenly a pickaxe breaks and extinguishes the miners' lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players is the saboteur? Find the gold first or direct the sinister actions of the saboteur. After three rounds, the player with the most gold wins.

A fun light game of hidden roles and coopetition. Everyone competes against each other. However, in a given round players must work together to reach the gold.

Really needs at least 5 people but once you have that many it plays incredibly well. The experiences this game creates are the kind that get retold for ages. Like the time I got caught in a lie, but another saboteur backed my lie, turning the suspicion off of me and onto the innocent miner who caught and accused me. He just sat there pulling his hair out as the whole table accused him as being the lying saboteur while he knew for a fact it was me. Always a ton of fun, as long as you don't try playing it with only 3 or 4 people.

Een spel dat goed is geschikt voor grotere groepen.

Spelers zijn kabouter die graven naar de schat. Maar een aantal van hen zijn saboteurs die juist willen voorkomen dat zij die schat bereiken. Deze verdeling is geheim. Spelers leggen gangkaarten aan die de mijn verder uitbreiden of maken elkaars uitrusting kapot, waardoor die spelers niet meer kunnen graven.

Dit spel is erg simpel en iets te veel afhankelijk van geluk. Bovendien is het met een even aantal spelers ook nog slecht gebalanceerd. Schijnt met de uitbreiding wel beter te worden.

For a bluffing game, this one can be a little bit boring and unbalanced.

Your chances of success depend a lot on drawing the right cards, so even if you manage to bluff well, you still need luck.

Slightly limited traitor game, as the saboteurs can either help the players win or make pretty obvious moves aginst them. Fun for a few plays, but gets stale quickly.

This game is different. I like the way it plays, but I feel that the saboteur has such a slim chance of winning. Although, i've only played with 4 players max... that could be why it's not clicking.

Nice game for a board game starter (easy setup and rules), also good for parties. What i like the most is the role of sole saboteur, but i dont get a chance to play it often. I like deceiving people, control they decisions, it's more like a role playing game to me:)

So far I've only played a practice game solitaire and the saboteur won due to great use of a cave in card that the miners weren't able to over come early enough.  They were one card away from winning but the saboteur had all the cards they needed.  I think this will work well.  I like the up to 10 players.

I one point this was my only party game (and Trivial, which meh, not fun). This meant that I basically played it to the point that I just got really tired of it. It felt always kind of the same: Saboteurs are in disadvantage and if they don't cooperate, they are doomed... all the time.

Traded.

Possible saboteur maneuvers: Impede team progress, get owned by Mille Bornes-esque disasters that require specific fix cards, destined to be drawn by people that don't need them and never by those who do. Or, help the team. (In other words, lose.) Or, get lucky - ever the prerequisite here - and find a map, and misdirect people. Then again, if you lend a hand the game ends quicker. Appealing, no?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fantastic game for playing with a big crowd that knows each other. Takes the traitor mechanic and boils it down to something easy and fun.

If you like something like shadows over camelot or battlestar galactica you have to play this. Shorter and much more fun.

RATING: 6
Another nice looking card game from Amigo with high quality cards and box.  Simple and fun, even if some of the elements don't feel quite right.  Scoring might need some kind of fix, (the game we played had two players playing saboteur due to the leader being so far out in front after 2 rounds).  If you like games with deduction elements (Royal Turf is another good one), this one is worth a shot.

RATING: 6
A short, fast paced semi-cooperative hidden role game. Most players are gnomes building a tunnel to find gold at the end of it, but one or more players could be saboteurs, trying to break the gnomes tools and break their paths to find the gold.
Not the best game but good as a filler with many people. Timing is a big aspect here, you shouldn't give away that you are the traitor to early but not to late, either.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played with four which means only one saboteur.  Once the saboteur is really discovered it becomes 3 vs 1 and difficult for the saboteur to win.  It was great fun and has potential for larger groups.  Four is probably too few.

This game can really be a blast with the right group.  I do think the saboteur ratio needs adjusting.

Funny party game that players are searching to find the gold. Goldminners try to build the proper ruite to reach the gold, as saboteur(s) try to avoid them of reaching their goals. The are some special cards too that make the game more exciting. Really easy to play and i requires some tacticts and strategy!

RATING: 6.5
It's a fine warm up or palate cleanser with many people. I don't get the feeling I have a whole lot of influence though. Team wins are empty if you're not the first to the gold. That's both a good and a bad thing I guess.

A really dumbed down deduction game.  I like the fact it can accomodate a large group and it isn't hard to teach, but I don't find it particularly challenging or fair in the distribution of rewards.  It's not bad per se, but why waste time on it when there are better options to choose from?

This is a nice party game. The more people play it, the better the game becomes. I quite like it I have to admit.
As a party game I rate it 8, because it needs at least 5 people to make it fun, but the game handles even 10 players.
With that many the downtime could become a bit of a problem, but I haven't played it with more than 6.

Cost was probably 2450 HUF

RATING: 3.5
This is one of the few games that after few tries I would argue to be "flawed". Being ridiculously outnumbered, saboteurs have a close to impossible task to accomplish.
On the other hand there are simply too many map cards: in every game all players had their chances to check at at least one destination card, and being the saboteurs less than half (and usually less than a third, and since we played with 6 we had almost always only ONE saboteur!) lying on the destinations can spoil the traitor identity in no time.
Being strongly outnumbered, once a saboteur is located, he is basically out of the game, as every player can stack a blocking action card onto him. At this point only having a buddy with a handful of unblocking action can help, but only up to a certain point, since helping him would spoil his own identity as well. But wait, even if you have the cards to unlock yourself or your buddy this will take away your turn, and the other players will eventually be able to block you further or reach the treasure.

So in the end, being the saboteur brings you out of the winning league with about 90% of the chances. Saboteurs can really win only if they are very lucky with card distribution (many tunnel-collapse card in their hand for example).
The bluffing is there, but up to a certain point. A saboteur could ideally play a tunnel card that is not beneficial to reach the treasure with the reasoning that he couldn't play anything else, but (a) either there are no spots to play that card with less impact (otherwise his move would spoil his identity) or (b) that card doesn't interfere with the path to the treasure (and being the saboteurs quite few in number this action just delays the reaching of the treasure by one turn).

To summarize, the big letdown for me is that saboteurs are in exceptionally strong disadvantage. They have to keep their identity secret, because once they are revealed they can be thrown out of the game easily, but to keep their identity secret they have too few means to interfere with gnomes' plans.
In the end, all of our games ended up with a podium made of people who had been saboteurs the least.

This game is perfect with over 5 people and I mean it. It's a quick light game that very easy to understand and that everyone I've played it with enjoyed. The game gets better when there is more player. We play it so there is always as much or a little less saboteurs than propsectors (3p-2s, 3p-3s, 4p-3s, etc.) and do not score points (who cares about points! the point is finding your allies and thwarting your ennemies!)

Magyarul: Aranyásók. :) Nagyon jó játék. Minél többen játszottuk, annál izgalmasabb volt. A játékban cspatok játszanak egymás ellen. Az aranyásók célját nem nehéz kitalálni :D megkeresni az aranyat, a szabotőröknek ezt megakadályozni. Tetszik a játékban az, hogy az elején nem lehet tudni ki az aranyásó ki a szabotőr. Ha jók a játékosok akkor kb. a játék felénél derül ez ki. Izgalmas, nagyon humoros játék. Gyakran kerül le a polcról, nem lehet nem szeretni! Kb 30 perces játék. Egyik után nyomjuk a következőt. Mindenkinek ajánlom. ;)

After 2 Plays: The saboteurs don't have enough opportunity to subtly affect the outcome.  Any attempt to divert the paths is pretty obvious, so the game comes down to whether of not the other players have the right cards to fend off the saboteurs.

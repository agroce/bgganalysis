Fun game for all ages. The 5 animals seemed balanced, the game is a joy to look at, and people that see it played tend to want to play it. Great for the family, and good for a lite or filler game for gamers. Don't over look this game.

RATING: 6
It has a great central concept whereby all players can control multiple characters in the race, and no-one knows which character each player is backing. That all sounds fab, but I have found that playing the game lacks excitement precisely because you can't cheer and get behind your chosen character. It lacks the significant fun aspects of other race games like Formula D, or even Camel Up, as a result. I know this game is aimed at younger players so I can't rate it too harshly. And the production values are brilliant.

RATING: 6
1st play: Not bad for a kid's game, the bits are good and the board is pretty.  I ended up matching 2 animals with one of the other players in a 3 player game, so we won pretty easily, as we were both pushing the same animals.  

2nd play: I intentionally picked a different animal just to see how much I could influence the outcome, and it turns out not much.  The rounds happen fast and poor turtle is really slow.  Fun game for kids though I bet.

A kids game that's fun with only adults. Say again? It's a game with very interesting choices, even for adults. Of course it's light (again, a kids game), but there's a lot of bluffing, reading and interesting card management going on. I love it, and fortunately, my 6 year old son does as well.

RATING: 7
This game is a lot of fun to play, although I suspect you really need to play multiple rounds of it to get much satisfaction.  I have only played it a few times but it seems that doubling down your bet is the way to go, at least with four players, which is frustrating if you are the guy who helped somebody else to win.  But there really needs to be more variety in the race tiles to make you want to play it multiple times.  I expect this would not be as much of an issue for kids, though.

The third installment in the Tales & Games series. The second I try.

The game is very straightforward: there are five competing animals (each with its very own, quite thematic, movement rules), and each player bets on two of them, and tries to help them reach the goal line in the first positions. There is a bit of jockeying and bluff, and everything is finished in 10-15 minutes.

The production value is quite high: gorgeous pieces and box, durable cards. Just a couple of things could've been better: the goal line (very thin and fragile) and the player aids (great for adults, but quite hard to decipher for kids).

It is quite rare that kids' games can be played by adults and still be meaningful and fun. This game is a rare gem: it works both as a game I can play with my eldest (6yo) and as a quick filler for my gamer friends.

This game may be very swingy, and may have a very obvious strategy (bet on the LAMB!!!) however, if you're looking for a fun, light card game that has some thinking and can be enjoyed with some good friends and a few drinks, look no further. It's fun to manipulate the race as much as you can, playing cards to help yourself and dumping cards that help your opponent when it is opportune. Simple, but clever. Indispensable as a family game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This simple, yet surprisingly strategic racing game is accessible to any type of gamer or non-gamer.  There is a tension in the game, like a great racing game should have, and any of the characters can come back and win from last place.  I have yet to play this game without immediate requests from everyone to do it again.

The Hare and the Tortoise is an uninspired variation on the roll (actually «draw» here) and move genre: although light and straightforward, it still isn’t a children game as the rules - however simple - take too much into account for the youngest to fully grasp them.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Good game, but too long to be a filler, and probably not enough meat to take up as much time as it does.  I would rate  this game a bit higher, but it really seems that some of the characters are not balanced correctly, which means with the forced bet, it can be a bit demoralizing to get stuck with the turtle.  2nd game I have played from this designer (the other is Abraca...What?), and this designer is clearly very clever with both games being unique and fun!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is an interesting game, and series.

It's an in-between game. It's very light and short for a family game (8+), but is a step up from a pure children's game (6+). The recommended age range of 7+ perfectly describes where it falls.

The worry with this kind of in-between design is that it will either be the best of both worlds, or the worst. And people will disagree as to which side this falls on.

For adults it works fine as a filler -- in fact, it's a single interesting mechanism with a light filler built around it. That's a good thing, in my eyes. But gamers will likely wish for more control, more of an ability to manage your hand and to influence your starting bet. It may well fall short of a gamer's hopes and expectations.

On the other hand, that same interesting mechanism may be hard to explain to children. The theming is meant to be attractive to kids, but it can be a challenge to explain. Once people see how it works, they get it easily enough, but it's hard to put it into a simple description that people hear and immediately understand; with children, of course it's even harder.

But in my mind, it's the best of both worlds. It's light and approachable and has beautiful presentation. It plays fast and simply, but still has that "interesting mechanism" that someone who appreciates all types of games can enjoy experiencing. The game works well as a filler for gamers, casual-playing adults, and families with smart kids. :)

Played at Spiel '14 and several times since.
I really enjoy this small game. There are always some interesting tactical options depending on your hand of cards, although there is very little strategy involved. The  hidden "bets" give the game excitement. I give it a 10 not only because of this, but because there is a really good synergy between theme and mechanics, something that is quite rare in small games.

Racing game, one which is fun with kids and adults. Each animal has a chance to win (some some more than others) and the fact that you dont know which ones the others secretly are trying to steer to victory makes you want to outguess your opponents. Best of the Tales game so far imo (after playing 5).

The race is on! Racing the hare, tortoise, fox, wolf and lamb. Well... You are kind of racing them. What you are doing is controlling who will win by playing animal cards. In the beginning of the game, you are randomly assigned one animal to "bet on" and then you'll pick one from your hand of cards. You play cards to move the animals, and depending on how the animals you bet on place in the race, you'll get points. The concept is simple, the setup is quick, and the design and art is fun. We played the rules a little bit wrong and when we fixed the error, the game game changed considerably for the better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
This is a small game that is easy to learn and probably best suited for kids – although I can definitely see that the decision-making isn’t always too obvious, and there is room for clever play. However, I must say that the game fell flat. It felt a little random that I won as I actually only got two of the cards for my secret bet, the wolf! So normally I wouldn’t stand a chance, but the other players played some wolf cards too (one of them due to a bet), so I got pretty lucky… J do like the special abilities of the creatures; that the turtle always moves, but slowly, the hare is always moving fast unless he’s ahead in which case he won’t move. The sheep has some neat abilities too. But I never really got into the game. Would play it again once more just because it’s so easy and fast, but it’s not particularly interesting.

RATING: 8
What a great betting game it plays fast and is very easy to teach as you simply play cards to move the animals through the course. Each animal moves differently, and with a limit of 8 cards in total or 4 of 1 animal there is a lot of different ways to play cards so that certain animals either move a lot or don't move at all. Points are awarded for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place and you can total points over multiple races with each race only taking 10 minutes typically. The only downside I can find is you only bet at the beginning of a race so you can go most of the game and get very few cards for the animals you want to win making it hard to feel like you have much control. That betting approach makes it tough and probably a little less enjoyable than Camel Up, but the game is just simply fun.

Probably the best of the Tales & Games series.  The very basic game is really simple and a matter of luck in drawing decent cards.  There is a bit of strategy in trying to get a certain character to land on his bonus move spot.

The advanced game though is really clever.  With each character getting their own special move resolutions, the strategy becomes more prevalent.  Being able to bet on two racers also gives a little more variety at end game scoring.

"rien ne sert de courir, il faut partir à point !" Vous connaissez tous cette expression? C'est un peu comme les cadeaux de noël. Si vous ne les avez pas déjà fait, vous allez en bavez. Je m'écarte du sujet. Ce jeu est un jeu pour les enfants, avec une très belle boîte en forme de livre (comme nous avons déjà "les 3 petits cochons"). C'est une course qui va se dérouler, où vous devrez parier sur l'animal qui va gagner. Le jeu est original, simple, tendu. Et moi, je ne parierai pas sur le lapin.

Pour 2 à 5 coureurs, pour des parties de 20 minutes

Great light game we use to decide pick order or first player in other games. The element of being able to hedge your bets makes for some great moments and the 10-15 minute play time means games are short and sweet.

A very simple game which can be played by the whole family. The longevity is average but the mechanics and the way the animals move is astonishing. At first they seems incredibly unbalanced but as you play you realize they are perfectly in sync and you can decide the moving with the right strategy
I would recommend it for families or light games players but not for couples as for 2 players is fairly poor.

RATING: 6
At last, a racing game that I look forward to playing, but you really need at least 4 players. The lamb and, to a lesser extent, the fox are overpowering at lower player counts. They are stoppable, but only if you play defensively by, e.g., hoarding cards when you'd rather be cycling through them.

I don't generally like fillers, but here is one I can appreciate. I think I like it more than I would have done had I not played and been very lukewarm on flamme rouge, this is a better racing game for me, as a racing game has to be simple enough for non gamers to play. Flamme rouge is simple, but it's a bit opaque whereas this is not. The theme is fun and makes the game easy to explain, the components are nice, though a few are a bit extraneous.

Very nice little card game. The race element is familiar stuff, the variable finishing is familiar stuff (the VP distribution could be improved). However, the balance of the effects of the cards for each animal is very well done. It brings some nice choices and double-think. We liked it a lot and did not think it was a filler game at all. Nice production, worth grabbing a copy.

The best game out of iello book series and a great light racing game in.

I always play with the 3 race marathon variant, The games are quick and tense, lots of decisions to be made (not counting the children variant).

My only minor beef is that after playing many races, the turtle stands almost no shot at placing first. All the others stand a fair chance (maybe the wolf slightly lower than the other 3). But it's a family game so strict balance is not their main concern

This game is so fun! I love the betting, and ability to attempt to get your character to win, but not so much that everyone KNOWS who you are rooting for. Otherwise, they will sabotage your character out of spite. Great for all ages! Only Adults. Only Kids. A mix of kids and adults. Recommended.

This game seems like the perfect Family Game. Cute Theme, quick playing time, great artwork, likable characters, easy game mechanism, great components.
If it wasn't for one unbalanced scoring mechanic i'd rate it a 8-9.
The problem arises when two players by chance choose and or get the same animal. The other players simply have no chance, as two players are pushing the same animal.

hm.. maybe come up with a variant?

My 3 year old's favorite game and one I actually enjoy playing with him.  A racing game played by collecting sets of cards and making secret wagers on the winner.  There's some actual strategy to be had here though the sheep is a clear favorite and the tortoise is always the underdog.

RATING: 5
The Hare & the Tortoise is a very thematic game that will likely appeal to families, but it is just a bit too luck-based for my tastes. The clever hidden objective and card-playing mechanics that fit the theme very well mask the fact that the luck of the card draw mostly determines the winner.

There's a solid game for grown-ups hiding in here, but as is, it's not something I'd personally request playing.

Cute little racing/betting game, with each runner having different advancement rules. You want to help the animals you've bet on, but sometimes the cards don't cooperate. You want to maximize cycling your hand, but you want to minimize the help you give to the "wrong" animals. With some animals, it's easy to see how you can dump cards when you haven't bet on that animal. Others are less clear.

This is my first game in the Tales & Games series, and it really makes me want to pick up the other two games in the series! Excellent game all around!

The components are very nice (the cards could be a bit thicker, but no real complaints). The game is really easy to teach even to very young children, but there is enough strategy to make it interesting to adults.

Plus the theme is just awesome and comes through in spades.  From the slow and steady tortoise and the napping hare to the howling wolf and lamb that always stops for a drink of water, the way the game plays out just makes sense with the very charming theme. The cards/stickers have nice art, and even the track tiles have some interesting tidbits (the chalk outline of a rabbit was a particularly funny one).

Love this game with 2 players, but it is also great with 4 and 5. I suspect it is actually at its best with 3 players. Fun, fun, fun, fun game!

Truly a game for the entire family. The decisions are simple, but at the same time consequential in not-always-obvious ways. Want to teach your kids aboutSix animals in a race to place 1st, 2nd or 3rd. Players play 1-4 cards of the same animal. When 4 cards of one animal have been played, or 8 cards total, the animals move according to the cards played. Every animal moves in a specific order and different numbers of spaces depending on what was played, also depending sometimes the position of the animal in the race and terrain. Before the race, players are dealt a secret animal they are trying to have win and they also add a second animal card from their starting hand. They will get points based on how their two animal cards placed (they can be the same animal, effectively doubling-down).

Players always have 6 cards in their hands, but can't always advance their own animals. Sometimes you may want to save your animals' cards in order to play more cards in a future round. Sometimes you want to play cards for other animals when they will be least effective. There are a surprising amount of options from turn to turn and the implications are clear enough for kids to have real "a ha" moments while also keeping things interesting for adults. Truly, an excellent family game.

The Hare & the Tortoise, originally published as Royal Turtle, is a card-driven betting game about animal racing loosely based on one of Aesop's Fables.

At the start of a race, each player secretly bets on up to two of five animals: turtle, rabbit, lamb, wolf and fox. One animal is chosen at random for each player, then after receiving a hand of seven cards, each player places one of his cards face-down (possibly the same animal) as an additional bet. Players then take turns laying down 1-4 cards, with all cards needing to show the same animal, then refilling the hand to five cards. As soon as eight total cards have been played or four cards of any one animal, the animals move (maybe).

First of all it's light. Even with the "advanced" rules, it's extremely light and random. If you are okay with that, that is, if you are okay with losing due to the fact that this game is about 70% luck (almost Zombie Dice random), then you should like this game. It's cute and fast-paced. The components are nice, as is the packaging. We played with a group of 5 gamers and had fun. With gamers, it's certainly a beer and pretzels game. I could see this being a hit with families, and I think that was the intended audience. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable game for anyone who's okay with giving up control and wants to take part in a silly race. 

Update 4/18/15: Played with 3 tonight. It's a little less random with 3, but you are still constantly stuck with cards that you don't want in your hand. I think it needs a house rule that if you have 4 of the same card in your hand (out of 6), you can discard and redraw. That way, you can have a better chance of helping your character.

Racing game, where you're not one of the contestants, but are involved in all of their movement. Requires some luck in which animal is drawn as your primary goal, plus the second one is also a bit lucky. But once the race starts, the cards fly on the table and the animals race for the finish line.

It's a rare thing that I don't like a game because of too much luck / randomness. However this game doesn't give adequate control or agency while playing. You can be screwed before the game begins by having / choosing characters noone else did. You can also be screwed by having no good outlet for unwanted cards. Meh... Pretty, but I'd just rather not - there are more fun games this one for the same circumstance (time / players / style).

Karácsonykor szerencsére sok játék került a fa alá, persze ehhez nyújtottam némi segítséget. Ez volt az egyetlen, amit nem azért vettem meg mert 'akciós' volt, és egyáltalán nem bántam meg!

Gyors, pörgős, magas szerencsefaktorú cuki verseny, amiben csakis a (legalább) 3 futamból álló bajnokságnak látom értelmét, pont a szerencse miatt. Hosszabb távon kiegyenlítődik, így nem zavaró. Meg persze tessék blöffölni, és megtanulni, hogy melyik állatot, hogy kell játszani! Létezik rossz párosítás, azt ne válasszuk!

Játékosszámtól függő, hogy melyik állat az esélyes, de még inkább befolyásoló, hogy mire hányan fogadtak. Ez az egy a 'buktató' a játékban, de ezt bőőőőőven ellensúlyozza a kivitelezés. Még dobogó is van!! Übercuki++ és nem utolsó sorban rendkívül szórakoztató!

Jelenleg a legjobbak közt a helye!

This is more tactical than it seems at first, pretty and family friendly. I like the race and the hidden role-esque betting mechanic. There is a children friendly 'simple' game for younger players too.

My play group thinks the sheep is OP, but I think it was because they didn't block him well enough even when I explained this before the first game and after (I had sheep each time we played as my dealt card, so wasn't trying to stop it personally).

I'd like to play a game when I don't have the sheep to see if it does less well. But I fear my group now thinks the sheep is best, so people will always pick it if they can, so therefore more people will want to help it (although with less cards if they all pick him!).

Upgraded rating from 7 to 7.8. Not quite an eight in my mind, but it gets extra 0.8 for being very much a game that the non gaming visitors loved. My wife enjoyed playing it too.

Put it back to a 7 because it never gets played. Fun game but not a favourite.

Up there with Jamaica (but on a simpler small shorter scale--even though Jamaica was already pretty simple) this is my favorite racing game! It is truly fun, outstanding, easy to teach to families, I'm sure but full of fun,interest, and just a box of delights as a short game for adults. I am so delighted with this game it makes me want to buy or play the others in the series. I understand that this may be the best one so far but with the release of Little Red Riding Hood, it's possible that one is nearly as good. So far this one has the best rating and reviews I believe of any that have been released but people think all of them are pretty delightful. I'm looking forward to trying more and I absolutely adore this game.

Nice addition to the series after Baba Yaga fell flat, and I like this one more than Three Little Pigs.  Boxes in the series look great on the shelf all together - nice ploy to keep me buying each subsequent title. :)

Included tale was too difficult for bedtime reading for the kids, footenooted definitions notwithstanding.  Feels out of place - almost academic - in comparison with the other two tales in the series.

Getting all the pieces correctly back in the insert is a mini-game in itself.

A shame that it shares a title with a veteran of the genre,  but H&T is a family-friendly card-driven racer that rattles along and has some nice variability in the simplest of modular track designs. The fact that something this simple even got balanced is little short of a miracle, although it does make hope of an expansion somewhat optimistic.

A very good family game, which works also very well as a filler game for gamers. 

I really love the thematic movement of the animals and from a couple of games it feels quiet balanced, especially because betting on asumed "fast" animals makes less cards available for that animal. 

It's of course still a very light game with quiet a bit luck of the draw also, but there is enough interesting choices to be made to still be interesting to all sorts of people. 

Very very nice one and the very nice components just help it even more.

I just love:

- the concept
- the components
- the packaging
- the way that players don’t choose one animal to race with but instead they bet on them.
- the card mechanics that move the animals
- owning it
- looking at it

I am not really sure about aspects such as strategy, having control over the final result or depth (maybe I am just a bad player). But it’s a light game and as such very enjoyable. If you don’t get unnecessarily serious you will have fun every time, with game groups of all ages. 

Nice go!

It surprises me how much I love this game.  It is just so darn fun. Got my family to play it and although they were skeptical at first, they caught on and ended up wanting to play a couple more games before we pulled it off the table.  I want to check into some of the other Tales and Games, specifically the Three Little Pigs one.  We keep picking that up at the game store, but have the constant problem  of an ever growing list of games on our want list and limited cash to spend.  Going to the game store is always at least an hour long debate while we hold 5 or 6 games in our hands.  Perhaps we should learn to prioritize our list before going in?  That sure would make things easier.

A light, but still interesting, racing game. I like trying to figure out which racers everyone wants to win. The card playing has enough luck and bluffing in it to make it interesting, though you have to be content knowing that you might not ever draw the exact cards you really want. A fun game for all ages.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
So here's the deal: it's a fun game.  Good filler, easy, there's actually a little bit of thinking to go with it.

It is, however, not something I'd ever really say that I WANT to play.  It plays fast, thankfully, because sometimes another player will get four or five turns before you get one, and then they'll get another four or five before you get another.  Like a lot of card games, you can lose by virtue of an unfortunate deal.

Final rating: I'd play it and probably enjoy it while we're waiting for someone or in the last few minutes, but nothing I'd ever put on the table.

A neat racing game that reminds me of Heimlich & Co. The artwork and pieces are really cute. Even though the tile-based gameboard is a tad fiddly. Then again, that makes it easier to fit it in the "Book" box. There is not a lot of strategy here when it comes to the hidden bets, due to the fact that it becomes very obvious early on, which player chose which animal to support / bet on. I wish there would be a bit more depth there. On the other hand, that might have made the game less family friendy.

Such a fun game with the kids. A simple card mechanism and a few wooden meeples and a racetrack. How much do you need. Its entertaining every time. We added a house rule when the wolf howls all the creatures dive off the track scarpering left and right into the bushes. The wolf runs and the characters return to their positions. Its fun. Play it like its a story. Remember lilly is always going to rig the cards to get the wolf. As often said this is a great filler game that brings out the "let's play again!".

Update: This is my fiancee's go to game for playing with non-gaming friends. And we now say that the sheep has to take two steps on the river tiles (one when it stops, and one when it leaves). Maybe that was what was intended? It seems to help.

Why is this game so awesome! I know it is a kids game but I have never played it with kids and every adult at the table falls in love with the game when I teach it. Once a race ends, the response is always, let's play it again. I do tend to bring it out most for non-gamers, so maybe that is why it is so popular. Very well designed, light, quick, easy-to-teach game.

A relatively simple betting race game on first glace. You bet on animals (secretly), then play cards to make them all move  - each animal accordingly to its movement style. (And these are quite thematic). However - kids can get into the game, but not sure if they get the game. 

The thing is - this is quite a subtle game (i.e not immediately obvious) game of hand management and clever manoeuvring based on this. The trick is in cycling through cards you don't need - With rabbit more cards isn't more movement, sheep stops at each stream regardless of card number, toroise always move regardless of cards unless there's max cards played on it. And so on. Some doublethink, some elbowing. Quite neat actually - but need to try it with adults and kids more to see with what groups it's best.

Cute card based betting/racing game based on the old fable.

The hare has re challenged the  tortoise to another race, but this time he has invited a few friends along... The wolf, the fox and the sheep...

A random track is laid out and all players receive a card of one of the animals, this is their betting card. then each player is dealt 7 cards from the normal deck. From this another animal is selected as a 2nd bet (could even be the same as the 1st one).

Then each player lays down up to 4 cards (but must be of the same animal) from their hands. A turn ends, and the race part starts when either 4 cards of the same animal or 8 cards in total have been laid. Each animal moves in a certain order and in a certain way depending on how many cards of each have been laid.

Overall a nice family/kid friendly game, but with enough strategy for the more serious gamer to have a relaxing quick race as well.

Hidden role racing game that's suitable for older children and adults. There's less control over the result than I'd like, both in the hidden roles and hand management, but it's short enough for what it is, and the production values are high. The design doesn't quite measure up.

RATING: 6.5
1 play, 2er

A light weight hidden role (sort of) racing game. Players will be moving all the pieces, but secretly bet on only 2 (or 3 in 2er) of them. Score points based on the finishing positions of your bets -- most points wins.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Construct the race track in random order (2 river spaces in random positions). The 5 racers (hare, tortoise, wolf, sheep, fox) are placed at the start. Players each get a hand of 6 cards, and a random betting card (2 in 2er game). Players each place an additional bet using one of their 6 cards. All bets are kept hidden until the end of the game.

In turn order, players play card(s) in front of them:
- max 8 cards in total in all players' displays
- max 4 cards in total of any one type, in all players' displays
If 4 of a type, or 8 total cards, are on the table, race movement is triggered. Otherwise, the next player plays.

If a race is triggered, each piece moves according to its own rules (based on the total number of cards of that type on the table). 

After 3 racers reach the finish line, score your bets (1st place worth 5, 2nd worth 3, 3rd worth 2); ties broken by finishing place. Most points wins!

One of my favourite games.

It's extremely well-balanced and exciting from the beginning to the end! :)

UPDATE
After dozens of plays it seems like the hare is more powerful than the others - specially that he is the first animal who moves. Maybe because we played most of the time with casual gamers and nobody blocked him with 4 cards.

A fairly simple card-driven race game that likely will go over better with families than serious gamers.

RATING: 8
It was really interesting to see how the cards played affected the different ways that the characters moved.  Light enough for beginners, but a lot of strategy in card play for more advanced players.

I was trying to figure out why I liked this game and it came to me. This feels like a stripped down version of Colossal Arena. 

Just like CA it has secret bets and a tableau of cards that decides who advances.

Short version of CA in an attractive package? Yeah, I'll take that.

The game does work with two, but as soon as you lay with more you really won't want to go back.





Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 3
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 3

2-5 players.

This is a quick tense racing game disguised as kiddy junk.

Everyone has 2 secret bets on the 5 racing creatures and must manipulate their hand of cards and the position of the racers carefully to get them across the line.

DEAD simple and tense. Great stuff.

RATING: 6
light racing/gambling game with some hidden information

[+] love the variable movements that seem very well balanced, cute artwork and components, love the box, quick game, easy to teach
[-] can get stuck with unuseful cards; with 5p you sometimes don't get to play any cards 1 or 2 turns in a row...

The best thus far in the Tales & Games series. This game has enough going that I feel it could be played as a light filler among adults. The card and racing mechanic is cool, and I like the hidden goals and scoring.

This game is light and easily accessible.  It is a decent amount of fun for what it is.  It is quite light but really a pretty good time.  I would consider it a good "end of the night" game, or a good game to play with the family.

Some kids games are fun for an all-adult group, but this isn't one of them. You might luck into a decision here and there, but mostly you're just hoping to draw the right cards.

Reminiscent of [i]Savannah Cafe[/i] in the way that each animal moves differently, though H&T is slightly better.

The 1970s classic [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/361/hare-tortoise]Hare & Tortoise[/url] (still in print?) is MUCH better, though that's aimed at a higher age bracket.

I like it. Great opener or filler game. Easy to pick up, still fun after several years. In such a small package comes a surprising amount of tactical decision making and race manipulation. Although the game should be called Hare & Tortoise & Fox & Wolf & Sheep   since... ya know, those are ALL the animals in the race.:laugh:

asymmetric race game where everyone secretly bets on who will win, then the players play cards to move the racers... each racer has a move condition/ability, so you have to think carefully about how and when to play the cards you draw... going to make my own version because it's cool!

This is a racing and betting game with more control over the racers than you find in Camel Up and more interesting bluffing than you find in Quicksand. Our first game was perfectly pleasant but the very fast sheep won easily and I don't know that we'll play often enough to learn how to counter that effectively.  I'm interesting in finding out all the same and if nothing else its a cute little filler goof for family gaming with enough going on to be worthwhile for game nights too.

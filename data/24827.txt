I really want to love this game, but it has this very odd way to compute your score when playing sets. Very odd! And inexplicable to me. I'm fairly confident this was thought through and has subtle impacts - but be that as it may, it doesn't appear to me at least to be worth the negative impact on explaining and then playing this game. It just isn't smooth enough. Other than that, this is a smart card game and enjoyable.

A artistically beautiful remake of traders of carthage. Traders of Osaka is a well rounded card game where you do your best to obtain goods and deliver them to Osaka on little ship meeples. A siple enough task if it weren't for the fact you were also competing to obtain these goods from a market with other players and attempting to not lose your ships to the dark tide. The only sticking point with this game is the scoring mechanism can feel a bit mathmatically clunky but once you score a couple times it becomes pretty intuitive.

Rating is for Traders of Carthage, NOT Traders of Osaka.  While I know it is essentially the same game, I love the trading in the Mediterranean theme (even when its just pasted on), I'm not so keen on the Osaka theme.  Would dock half a point for theme. 7.0 for Traders of Osaka, 7.5 for Traders of Carthage, but still a good solid game either way.

RATING: 8
A clever little game of shipping four different types of goods to Carthage and maximising your profits.  Picking up goods cards of a colour moves the ship of the same colour towards its destination. A complicating factor is that when a ship docks in Carthage, any ships on pirate spaces lose their goods.  The cards are multi-functional, serving as goods, money and storage jugs, which somehow prevent pirate theft.

For a simple game, Carthage gives you a fair bit to think about and rewards planning and careful attention to what other players are doing.  The Z-Man production is pretty good.

My White Whale... In 2007, roughly when I started collecting, I saw this game online and thought it looked great, put elected to put off purchasing it. By the time I got around to it, the game had apparently vanished from the material sphere. After many years of searching, I acquired in the spring of 2012. Outstanding game. Very strategic and interesting for such a simple game. Incredibly underrated.

Hard to state a clear opinion on this one... I played once, I liked it a lot and I am not sure I want to play again even if I lost. The game seems to work perfectly with 2 players, it's cutthroat (a big plus) and it plays fast. The preliminary rating is 7.25, based on my initial positive opinion and the ease of the rules.

Inventive design for a bunch of numbered cards.  Wish it had a Japanese theme, or any theme at all really.  Not certain about the amount of control in the game but it had interesting mechanics, decent production, and good playtime.  And I always love compact boxes!  I played it with two at the urging of the forum, and I can see how people prefer it that way to more.  I still found it mathy and uninteresting, but MAYBE it would light up with repeat play.  Don't know if I'll get there with it.

Sometimes simple games can emerge with really intriguing game play.  That's what happens in this Japanese take on a light Euro card game.  Basically a set collection game with card drafting, the simple game design is easy to teach, very fast to set up, and better than you might expect.  Worth playing and works well with just 2 players as well.

RATING: 8
Tight economic card game. I have not played it with the original theming (Traders of Carthage), but the art and setting for this are quite nice, with a beautiful board. You are buying goods on Market, and having them shipped towards Edo, hoping for a payout. Multiple uses for the cards, as coins, goods or insurance, and very interesting how you convert 5 points to a victory point card (yet another use for them) by placing them face down. Another win for Z-Man along with Sky Tango, Arboretum, the new printing of Lords of Scotland, etc.

A simple, mostly powerless card (2's and 3's can insure goods) game that rises above its simplicity to provide a great card game. The rules can be tricky to handle, particularly the rules for points.

Only two player games so far, but I'm content with that. Once again my love for commodity speculation has brought me here. Traders is simple to set up and go, but it doesn't strip out so much that it feels like a microgame. Watch what your opponents might want or get hosed. The scoring isn't complex but it is a little convoluted. Rating may go up with more plays.

Outstanding game with lots of challenging decisions. It's a small game with many clever twists and it has good replayability. Knizia did not design it, but it feels like one of his, however ToC has its own presence. 

Traders of Carthage deserves much more attention than it gets! It's a superb two player game with numerous tactical decisions to be made in every turn. 

UPDATE: This is rapidly becoming my very favorite game. Each time we play we learn more about how to best play the strategies that increase your chance of winning. We love the way you have to be aware of about 4-5 different roles each turn and our games are almost always decided on the last turn. Tonight I won 29-28 and we were both engrossed in the game from beginning to end. 

Designer Bruno Faidutti, designer of Citadels, has chosen Traders of Carthage as his 2009 Game of the Year for 2-3 players.

This is a well designed game with well thought out components. I probably wouldn't enjoy it against most of the people I play with though. This game needs you to be a dick and unashamedly be a screwer of best laid plans. You need to think ahead and do what it takes to win, especially if you are taking a giant crap on a move that your opponent spent the last several turns setting up. I enjoyed this with my brother. I am certain he is smarter than I am and as such he is a very challenging opponent.

Weird little card game. There is a big gambling element to this. You collect cards of four different colors, trying to get boats of the same color to the end of the map, scoring points for you. However, if boats are 1 or 2 spaces away from the end they sink, and you lose all of your goods of that color. Cards are used as money and as goods depending on how they are taken from the central area. This was a tough one for me to wrap my head around. I had the original version (Traders of Carthage) that I played once with Flo years ago before trading away. I am not 100% sure the rules for this are exactly the same, however. Need to play this one again to decide if I am keeping it or not. Right now, I would say Trade Pile.

This is a surprisingly simple card game. Of course by "simple" I'm referring to the rules, because they are very straightforward. Now the strategy takes a bit more thought in order to get it right, but that's probably a good thing. Perhaps the toughest decision in the game is figuring out when it is worthwhile to use up a turn in order to reserve a card. There is so much to think about on every turn. I found it tough to know when to grab high cards or low cards, and planning ahead for one of the ships reaching Carthage was tough. The most frustrating part of the game was when I found myself in an endless cycle of grabbing cards in order to save up to buy the market, but being short of buying all the cards that showed up for my next turn. I'm not sure how much of this was poor planning on my part or a flaw in the game. I suspect if you played with someone who had a big analysis-paralysis issue, this game could drag out a little too long, so that might be an issue as well. I understand this game is best when played with only 2 or 3 players, so that's almost a guarantee that I won't purchase it, but I think I would probably recommend it to others.

After four (and a half) games, I've played it with 2, 3 and 4 players.  The more I play this, the more I like it.  It's not great, but for 2 or 3 players it is a good filler-type game.  And it's a clever game, albeit a bit inelegant in its scoring.  Thank you Secret Santa 2008!

I've upped my rating a bit after 5 plays.  The more I play this game, the more I like it.  It is simple, but makes for some tough decisions where you have enough information to make it interesting but not so much that it's just a calculation.  I think it's probably best with 3 players.

Best with 2?  There is a lot going on here.  There is a lot of bluffing and feinting in the card selection, trying to jockey for the boats you want to deliver, and to watch out for pirates, or even steer the other guy's boats into the pirates.  Nice artwork too.

Update, raised from 9 to 10.  Played a bunch more, always 2 player.  There really isn't anything to dislike about this game.  Possibly one of my favorite compact-but-meaty 2 player games.

Plenty of player interaction, with a good level of control in the 2-player game.  There are indeed some similarities to Hansa.  Fun and reasonably quick.  For some reason I don't understand, I like games with components that serve several complementary (and/or exclusive) functions.  Here the cards are goods, money, and victory points.  And the dual use of "achievement" markers for additional scoring and as the game clock is clever.

The merchant shipeeples are great!  The cards are very thin and have dark edges.  They are easy to mar.  On the good side, they shuffle quite well.  The artwork on the boards and cards is very nice.  Colors of the goods are very nice.  The player colors tan and dark brown are unusual, but that's ok.  The tan in particular doesn't always show up well against the card backgrounds

An okay game of commodity speculation, hand management and set collection.  It has some of the simple elegance that I look for in a game, but the rulebook is far from simple for first-timers.  The game can play fast or slow depending on how much people want to try to analyze the ramifications of their choices.  I agree with the following comments from other people on BGG: high luck of the draw, usually obvious choice on each turn, better with 2-3p because you have a bit more control over the ship movement (although luck still plays a big role).

Provisional rating, need to play this a bit more. 

Game has a definite 'kit' feel to it - no lavish german production here, just a tiny box, tiny cards and a pretty decent game (at least it's very portable). I like it, I like the drafting mechanic and it's a bit deeper than first appears as you can have a really big influence over others with which cards you pick or reserve. Short enough to be a filler, but with some thought which is what I like.

Despite containing a board, this is definitely a card game where the board could have been replaced by a single board-card. There are four shipping companies all trying to deliver goods from Alexandria to Carthage along a route that includes 4 intermediary locations. Ships move forward when the market is emptied and it contained cards of a specific company's color. One card moves its ship forward one space; two or more cards move its ship forward two spaces. If at least one ship reaches Carthage, there is a scoring where players possessing stock (cards) in a company's color get a certain number of VPs based on a formula involving number and type of cards. They also receive a token which means they'll get more VPs the next time that company's ship scores. In addition, if a ship reaches Carthage, all ships in Carthage move back to Alexandria while the ships one or two spaces from Carthage are moved back to Cyrenaica (3 spaces before Carthage) and players with goods (cards) for those companies may lose them unless they protect themselves from pirates (by discarding cards in hand (coins) of the correct color).

Cards serve three purposes. First they are cash for buying goods, second they are goods needed for conversion to VPs, and third they are protection from pirates. There are two rows of cards. The bottom row is the market and players can either take one card into their hand to later use as money (or protection from pirates) or they can buy all unreserved cards in the market (each player has one reservation token to protect cards from other players). The top row is the futures market and gives a partial view of what is coming (the market is also partially filled from the deck). 

Each time a player takes a card from the market or reserves a card in the market, he makes it that much easier for the next person to buy the market, causing a push of ships. With two players, this makes for such a fine tempo-balancing game. Often a player where reserve a card in the futures just to avoid making the market cheaper.... or he'll make the market a little cheaper taking a lesser-valued card in hand to make the other player spend all of his cards to buy the market. The cards are chunky and no change is given so getting the right combination of money cards is important. 

A second consideration in the market is that ships only advance if the market is bought with a card of that ship's color in it. If your opponent is heavy in cards for a particular color, you may want to take that color as cash to prevent your opponent from scoring, or you may want one card there so the ship advances into pirates at the same time another ship scores. 

Lastly, some cards have higher numbers which makes them more valuable as money (and somewhat more valuable for VPs). Other cards have lower numbers but the ability to protect played goods cards from pirates (if the color matches). While in general, you want the higher cards, those low cards absolutely have their uses and ensure there's never a no-brainer decision in this game. 

ToC is a game that plays in a short period of time (30ish minutes) and has a ton of brain-crunching player interaction. While I have only rated it an 8, it has the potential to rise to a 9 or 10 with more plays.

De 2 a 4 jugadores.Es un juego de cartas que viene acompañado de un pequeño tablero. Las cartas representan cuatro tipos de mercancías. Hay dos zonas desde donde se puede coger/reservar cartas. La granja (que viene a ser el mercado futuro) y el mercado. Las acciones de cada jugador pueden ser: coger una carta que pasa a su mano (en cuyo caso respresenta dinero), reservar una carta (que no podrá ser comprada por nadie) o comprar todas las cartas del mercado.
Cuando se compra todo el mercado, los barcos asociados a cada mercancía comprada avanzan una o dos casillas . Cuando un barco llega a su destino (cartago), todos los jugadores pueden vender las mercancías de ese tipo. Cuando eso sucede, si hay barcos en las casillas de pirata, todos los jugadores que no puedan proteger sus mercancías de esos tipos, las pierden.
Es sencillo de jugar, pero sesudo y con alto componente estratégico. Recomendable.

I wanted to love this game--a lot of other people seem to, but I found the upkeep a little monotonous: Move the Farm cards to the Market, draw two cards and add to the Market, and then draw three new cards for the farm. Somehow doing that every five to ten seconds between "buys" got old fast. I love the components and the theme, however. I wonder how this would work if you lower the 8 point target to 6 or 5. That would mean a shorter game with less upkeep.

RATING: 7
I quite like this one: it's neatly put together. Not too many components, not too many rules, plenty of thinking. Quite difficult to peg back someone who's managed to do well, however. And doing well may be more to do with a lucky draw than clever strategy.

Rarely have I played a game that confused me so much on my first play: for some reason it was hard for me to think of the cards as money/pots in my hand and goods on the table. Once you get it down the game presents you with some very tough decisions, as you want both money and pots in your hand, but they need to match the colors of the goods you can afford. I'll need to play this a bit more before I can give a final opinion, but it is a very unusual, very original game.

Shame that such an attractive theme doesn't extend beyond the packaging.  It might not make sense but I prefer even very lightly themed games to abstracts as they just seems easier for me to get to grips with but the theme here really is wafer thin, diaphanous even; which is a dissapointment.  Nevertheless, this appears to be one of those games which blossoms as you play it more and come to understand and appreciate its eccentricities and I've been happy to play again a couple of time to check that first impression. I've liked it a bit more on each play and nudged up my rating each time.  While it still feels a bit on the chaotic side the randomness is not uncontrolled and it plays quickly enough for that not to be a major problem.

The new Traders of Osaka is the same game as Traders of Carthage, but the graphical design and presentation is far more attractive and functional. Having played the new edition, I think the comment below is not wrong; this is a clever game but there just isn't that much to it, you don't have much of a "lever" against your opponents, and most choices you make come out in the wash. It's a fine enough game but even now, 10-ish years later, the Japanese design aesthetic is really hit and miss. While it does echo the early "German" aesthetic - clean, elegant, and more emphasis on substance than style - it often lacks the German sense of narrative and pulse that could usually be found even in abstract games. Traders of Osaka doesn't have a beginning, middle, and end, just an ongoing series of small transactions. So it's interesting, but somewhat unengaging. Reminds me a bit of the tepid flavorlessness of Splendor; but a lot of people like Splendor.
---
Hmm; dunno. It seemed clever, and I was enjoying it, but then the final scores were like 15-15-15-14 and the luck seemed to overwhelm skill. There seems an immense timing advantage in being able to make a big purchase just after having to deal with the pirates, and this is pretty swingy (unless we were missing something in the rules). Anyway, an interesting and simple and clever game, but I still need to be convinced that there is really any skill to it beyond naked opportunism.

The game works just fine, but it doesn't really seem like there's much of a way to control your fate in this one.  It suffers from the Alhambra syndrome, where you really have no control over what might be available to you once your turn comes around.  Perhaps this should only be played with three, but I still can't see much in the way of difficult or exciting decision-making.

Based on 1 play with 2 players:

Lots to think about in very little time. I like it! Frankly, I don't see the need to try this with more than two; I suspect you just don't have the same control over the market with higher player counts, though maybe it'd be okay with three.

I really like how you have to think carefully about not only your optimal move, but what opportunities you're giving your opponent with any given play (both on the board and with the cards).

There's so much to consider each turn, I can see this having a lot of staying power.

RATING: 7
[u]October 2008:[/u] The game is almost purely tactical, you don't really have much strategy to plan out. The game is great for 2 players and goes for about 45 minutes, I guess it should be less but my gf is quite slow. My only 3 player game was good but I prefer the 2 player. I feel like you are too much dependetn on the player to your right, but the game is still quite enjoyable (it lasted 90 minutes though, a bit too much for this kind of game if you ask me). I think the 4p game would be too chaotic.
The randomness of the market is not that important as you can prepare a little bit with the farm.

[u]May 2009:[/u] Just played another game, I had forgotten how much I actually liked this game. It played faster than usual thoug it still is a bit ongish and that will prevent it from hitting the table more often. Without much choices each turn (you just have 3 basic choices), not one of these are easy ones. The game is a lot richer than what a simple reading of the rules would suggest.
The length is the only thing that prevents it from having a better rating.

So much counting just bored me to tears with this one. You are always counting the market to see if you can buy goods, counting cards of the opponent to see whether they can buy, and constant moving of cards/tokens around the table. Combine that with even more math to do the scoring multiply 2 values (adding in any achievement tokens), round up to the nearest 5, and then divide by 5 to see how many cards you keep turned this into nothing but a number exercise that left me wanting to end so I could play something else.

This is a solid, 30 minute game to play with the Misses.  I like that it isn't a brain burner, but as you play you can think about your moves as much as you like.  And that you can turn your thinking cap on and off.  

I'm not sure that makes sense.  Traders is light enough to be played without thought, deep enough to be played well with some thought, and robust enough that you can play well without having to think deeply all the time.

So it works well as an evening game to unwind after a long day.

The pirates provide a clever twist in this set collection game.  Players buy sets of colored cards that earn points based on a calculation involving highest valued card, number of achievement tokens (1 earned per sale), and count of cards in the set.  A payout of veeps occurs when the like colored ship reaches Carthage.  Any ships in the pirate zone when this happen are raided.  This forces anyone with goods belonging to those ships to either discard the goods or discard coins from hand as storage to protect one or two goods per card, thus making the good more expensive.  Players control the timing of payouts by their purchases in the market which propels the ships on their five step voyages.  This is made more interesting by the existence of the farm.  The farm displays three of the five cards that will next be added to the market.  From futures to market to merchandise with the inherent risk of raid or storage costs, this game has enough information to make choices interesting.

Will not play again without a timer.

Set collecting game, lot-auctions. This is the game with the little boats progressing along the pointless game board, the cards (all of which are placed off the board) are the main focus. There should be (if there isn't) a game which does exactly the same thing but purely with cards.

Production: Nice graphics on regular quality cards.  Colors are vivid. An efficient use of components.

Play: Cards serve as money, commodities, protection, and victory points. It's quite a mental challenge to make one's move, knowing that by taking a high valued card, I am making the market cheaper for my opponent to buy, and by selecting a card to later use as protection, I am also decreasing the chance it will be in my hold, and that it will advance.

The game is very limiting in what you can do on your turn, and there can be turns for which you cannot make a move that is good for you. As a result, it can be very frustrating and not fun. But I came in last in a game of four, so take my comment with a grain of salt, I guess.

Preliminary 6 rating. May go up, I think, with more time. I really love the theme of trading, and the setting is nice (breaking away from Europe was a good idea, imo). The art work is wonderful. The mechanics to it are where it shines- the inter-dependency players have with each other for getting ships through to the destination, is a tricky, cool thing.

Also like how the score accelerates as you go- but you have to watch that carefully. It can get so fast that it limits your playstyle as you go on in the game, but while sometimes frustrating, I see this as a good thing, because it means you become more predictable to those behind you, if you want ot win. So it is a dynamic, natural catch up mechanism. Which, while counter intuitive at first, is very true.

Well designed!

Traders of Carthage is a strange game in that it plays not like any other game in my collection. The mechanics may not be that unique on their own (cards with multiple uses, set collection), but when put together, you have a completely unique game. Because of this, it took me some time to discover how to control the pace of the game and limit the options of my opponent. But it was worth the time investment. I'm looking forward to more play so that I can delve deeper into the game's strategy space.

No control, total player chaos and a bunch of rules that have no connection with the supposed theme.  The mechanics of the game work, but the gameplay is boring.  Similar to Alhambra, but not even as good as that, and mind that the bar that Alhambra set is pretty low (BTW, that's the first time I've used good and Alhambra in the same sentence). So, if you like that, you'll probably like this.  I try to avoid both like the plague, though.

I bought Traders of Carthage for three reasons. 1: Eric had been playing it a bit and said it was decent. 2: It was cheap at my FLGS. 3: I liked the ancient world theme.

As far as lighter games went, it was not bad. I should have realized, however, that it probably wasn't going to quite equal Race for the Galaxy or Zing! in sheer enjoyment factor and passed on it, but ultimately I do not regret buying it TOO much, despite the fact that I have not played it more than twice since purchasing it.

Evocative of Jaipur, ToO is a very simple ruleset, a tough stategy to visualize and realize (due to card draw), but quick enough that you don't really quite care 'cause you can just do it again.  Surprisingly, the score can be close even if it looks like someone is running away with the game.  The artwork is beautiful and the card stock is great.

This is great with 2 players.  Give it a shot!

A neat little card game with a small board. Basically a tradeoff between collecting resource cards and hoarding the same colour in your hand to protect against losing those resources.

This game feels pretty abstract, but at least the design is an attractive one.  I should say that maybe I'm rating this one a little higher than my initial gut instinct.

Verdict:  We both enjoyed it and want to play again.  Lots of little things to keep in mind and look out for when selecting and performing actions.  Not a whole lot of tension, but the decisions are interesting.  My daughter didn't play too optimally, so maybe I need to help her a bit in seeing the strategies on our next play.

We'll see.  I'll rate after another play.

Pretty tight game for 2 or 3 players. Susumu Kawasaki has been doing a great job designing interesting mechanics and game experiences with just a deck of cards and no "special" cards. This simplicity in gaming is rather refreshing to me. From a gameplay experience this game is worth a few plays as it is pretty good. 

It's funny that I find R-Eco to be a little too procedural, yet this game is acceptably procedural. Maybe it's just the extra shuffling around of the money, cards, and chips. Another idea is the narrative of the ships moving across the sea is contributing to the experience. The theme is extremely thin, so that may not be it. Whatever the negligible difference, Traders of Carthage feels more like a total game and less like a mechanic of a larger game.

Clever game. It's a lot about timing its right to score a big killing and not giving opportunities to the player on your left to do the same. Very enjoyable and I'd play it again. The 30-minute playing time is misleading though. I'd say it's more 45-60 minutes.

Played once and left me cold. No real urge to play again. Just weren't enough decisions for me.  Basically comes down to take a card or buy the cards showing. If you can't afford the cards showing, then you have no real choices (which card to take, but it's pretty minor).

There is an interesting dynamic between selecting a card to add to your hand as gold or purchasing every cards that is available as goods. 

Purchasing goods generally moves the ships forward and when one reaches the end you score points for the goods in front of you that share a colour. Other ships slightly lagging behind then get caught in the storms and sink, possible taking your goods with them. 

Maybe it was my shuffling, but as a two player game this just didn't quite work as we mostly had the same colour goods on the same ships and thus were both attempting to save the same ships and get them to port.

Sold in 2016.

RATING: 7.5
Looked interesting. You load your ship as it sails, and cash in when you reach Carthage. Some printing errors but nice progression although we didn't play it through. Flipping the cards to show their scoring could have been done like Bohnanza. ***  Played  in full at home, it's a nice game, I look forward to the re-issue. It needs a player-aid and different colours for the ships/players but there's a good quick money game here. Well worth tracking down.

It is the best 45 min.- 1 hour, 2-player board game I've ever played.  In my opinion, it's complexity, elegance and replayability edge out other (great) 2-player games such as Kahuna, Odin's Ravens, Jaipur, Starship Catan, Power and Weakness, King of Siam, etc..  I know that it can be played with 3 or 4 as well, but, in my experience, it's (far) better with just 2.

I always appreciate games like this one that don't take up more space on the shelf than need be.  (1 1/2 x 6 x 9.) Easy to cart around as well.

Z-man uses quality components, pleasant graphics combined with good printing, and sturdy boxes with durable finishes--and this one lives up to that reputation.

Strategic choices to be made in this game:  Do you pick up the card for money or do you buy it as merchandise?  If you use a card to make a purchase, does that leave you vulnerable to pirates?  Do you bring a ship to port at a time when you are also susceptible to pirates or do wait a round while your opponent might have the chance to increase their points?  These are but a few of possible considerations.

There is a lot packed into this little game, yet the few rules are uncomplicated.

Kind of dry, just cards with numbers on them.  I like how small the games is and the price isn't bad at all.  It just feels like a couple different mechanics and  a deck of numbered cards.  I think it's best with fewer players to give more control and a shorter play time.

This is a cool tactical card game very reminiscent of R-Eco, a game by the same designer.  It's all about timing as sets are collected and then traded in for points when they will provide the maximum benefit for you and the least benefit for your opponents.  The Pirate element allows opportunities for making your opponents lose significant amounts of cards, so there's definitely a mean streak in this one.  This has more strategy than R-Eco, but I think R-Eco is more fun.

Aránylag egyszerű kártya draftolós játék. A játék érdekessége, hogy a kártyák, áruk, amiket hajóval kell elszállítani Edoba. Igen ám, de hajók sebessége attól függ, hogy ki mennyi kártyát visz az adott típusból. Viszont akit félúton, a nyílt tengeren ér a vihar annak meg kell védenie az árait további kártyákkal. Érdekes ritmusjáték, de négyesben kicsit talán nehezen kiszámítható. Gyanítom, hogy hárman lehet  a legjobb.

A somewhat unexpected hit! Traders of Osaka (formally "...Carthage") does push-your-luck mechanics in an intriguing way. The mechanic of either taking one card for money or buying all cards as merchandise works extremely well. The ability to reserve a card is a worthwhile touch and the whole way the market and "high tides" is handled is smart. If I have only one complaint it's that the 4-player game can wear out its welcome and the game doesn't flow as well as it should. Still a very strong game I prefer this 2.  Traders of Osaka could be considered a filler considering its simplicity, but it's one of the more interesting light games around. Quite good!

A trading card game that reminds me of Jaipur in weight, theme and play style.  Beautiful art.  There's an interesting balance of trying to accrue cards while making sure you're working toward whichever ship arrives in port next and that none of your goods are on sinking ships.  Cute, fast, light.

What a surprisingly strategic game.  With four players, there was too much chaos, but with three, it allowed just enough space to plan ahead.  I was expecting a simple, silly card game, but it was a lot of fun.

It's good with two players, but better with three.  With two, it's too hard to stop your opponent.  There were times when I could tell there was nothing I could do!

Played again after a long time in between, and it was just as good as I remembered it.  Quite a bit of strategy involved.  So simple, but so good!

With more plays, I'm back to maybe liking it more with two. There is some good long-term planning in this game. I really like it!

Initial impression: sailing track to Carthage with the pirate spaces is pure genius. Gives a simple set collecting game, like Coloretto, MUCH more depth. The decisions have a surprisingly high number or factors that influence them.

[On the Coloretto reference. Many similarities. Collecting sets. The cards you can collect are community cards which are up to manipulation. Have to make choices about whether or not a set is strong enough to take now or if you want to wait in case it gets better. Strong difference: available cards diminish rather than increase as the 'round' continues.]

Played with my girlfriend for the first time. She thought it was like Alhambra. She liked it better. I find that I think this game is a little brilliant, but just am not itching to play it. Can a game be brilliant but lack a little fun? Need to try with 3. Worried that with 4 it will be a chaotic mess.

RATING: 7.5
Personally, I really enjoy this game. Although the mechanics of using the cards you're collecting as their own currency is nothing new, it's still fun. The game can be a tad shorter than I'd like, with less opportunity to develop a broader collection strategy, but that also makes it a nice filler. Unfortunately, those I've played with haven't played it often enough to really appreciate it as most seem to take about 3 games or so to catch on to the gameplay for some reason. UPDATE: My wife said this game is FUN! (Yay, I get to keep it!) UPDATED UPDATE: My wife was more "meh" again, so it's been traded away.

After one play with only 2 players, I think it's okay as a 30-minute filler game.  There were some interesting strategic decisions to make, particularly with reserving a card, and deciding whether to buy that card (as a good), or draw it (for coinage), which depended on which boats would reach Carthage and which ones would be looted by pirates by any particular purchase of goods.

But I can see how this could turn into a chaotic and nightmarish game of "when will it end?"  With more than 2 players, you have little control over which boats will be in pirate waters when a boat reaches Carthage.  So in the several turns after your turn is done, the pirates could steal all your goods.  Furthermore, pirates could steal so many goods that it would take forever for one player to accumulate enough achievement tiles to end the game.

I don't find this game particularly compelling, and have no reason to try it again.

Didn't do much for me. In a four player game, the choices you make will affect the game state for your opponents, but by the time your turn comes back around it will have completely changed again, so it doesn't seem like there's a lot of control there. Everyone agreed it might be better with 3 or 2, so maybe it deserves another shot with fewer players.

Played two times solo w/2-players so far, and seemed to take a little longer than 30 min to play (which is possibly just a NuB issue).  

A neat little game which needs a lot of thinking/planning/reacting/countering in what to choose.

Reservations are safe, but you can only have one, and may not have a terrific target.  Taking money is always an option, but either reserving or self-funding may make the remains good picking for the opponent.  Buying the market may set things up for your opponent- or yourself.

It's got a lot going on in a small package- very worth while, and likely to increase in rating as I play more.

I had played this once before, but did not fully grasp the strategy. I was reluctant to play it again, as this is from designer of Stack Market, which is in my opinion, just plain awful. Here was another game like Glory to Rome and Innovation (which I cannot stand), where the cards represent either coins, commodities, storage, or victory points. Strangely enough, I ended up thinking it isn't a bad design, along with the other two players. I can't help but think this is a simplistic card game, with a thin theme slapped on top, but there is actually a deeper victory point race game here. And for something that plays in about 30 minutes, with very quick turns, this may be a pretty good filler. We'll try it again and see how I feel. Initial rating: "6"

(09/20/2014) Update. After being neglected for 4 years and 4 days, we play again. I think as a group we understood the game better, due to going over the rules more thoroughly. The "reserve" action didn't make sense back then, but seems to have more important now. Knowing what is available to the player next in turn order is important, as well as seeing what ships will arrive in Carthage, as well as knowing what ships will be subject to pirating, all makes for a fascinating game. I was very reluctant to play this over the past four years, but glad the owner persisted in bringing it to the table. It is a solid filler, so the rating has gone up to a "7". Most likely we will play this more frequently now.

Personally I really like the way the mechanics in this work and the multiple uses for the cards. Everyone else I played with wasn't quite as smitten so I ended up trading it away in favor of something that will hopefully see a bit more play time.

I think it falls into that category of being SLIGHTLY too long for the amount of depth/novelty/whatever that it brings to the table.

It says it works for 2--4 players but I found that -- like many games -- with anything more than 2 it devolves into a level of chaos that isn't really appropriate for a game of this length and style. At least not for me.

The scoring is not nearly as complicated as the explanation in the rulebook makes it out to be. I wish they had just included a score track to negate the whinging about it.

A resource management card game which is mostly about buying the right thing at the right time.  There is certainly a fair amount of tension when you are trying to decide whether to buy, or to leave it for someone else.  Less important is an unusual (or unusually implemented) timing element wherein holding on to your goods for too long causes them to be lost. At the same time, holding on to them helps you to collect larger sets which are worth more.  Specialization is good because of tokens you get from delivering sets.

It's superior to R-Eco (though it has a similar overflow mechanism) but fills a similar niche.

Aug08: Well, you can definitely tell this is by the same designer as R-Eco.  It has a lot of the same signs.  A deck of 4 colors with only a couple different values per color.  Always being able to know what your opponents have in their hand.

It does add more than R-Eco though.  Now there is a small board that tracks the movement of some ships.  There is also a "futures market" where you can see most of the cards that will be entering into the market soon.  There is also a ridiculous scoring equation that is fun to try to explain to people.

The game goes quickly, and there are interesting decisions to be made.  I'm not so sure that there is a ton of fun involved.  There is almost too much rules overhead for there to be a lot of fun.  Or maybe that's just me being negative since I shot myself in the foot in the second game.

Either way, I'm not convinced I need to own it.  I much prefer the simplicity and the tension of R-Eco.

Subtle game with interesting choices.  The rhythm feels quite different in a 3 vs. 4 player game.  But I enjoyed both experiences.  Designer Susumu Kawasaki is to be congratulated.  His designs are as novel as they are diverse.  My one nit pick is that this game would have been better with a Japanese theme.  We hardly need Japan to start designing trading games about the Mediterranean.

RATING: 7.5
Set collection, commodity speculation (short term only...not with an eye towards endgame), and a bit of push-your-luck. The components are lovely and the whole thing fits in a tiny box. I like the preview of available goods, as well as the reservation mechanism. The VP calculations are inelegant but serviceable.

RATING: 5
When I played Traders of Carthage in 2010 I considered it a decent/intriguing game:

"Interesting game.  Simple rules, but very unintuitive how to play it efficiently at first.  There are interesting mechanisms and non-trivial decisions, but ultimately you got a feeling that the game plays you and not the other way round.  Single stroke of luck (card drawing) might favor a player in an instant, so that the other one will not recover til the end.

I think about this game mainly as a 2-player one (I played it only in this mode).  It's prone to be longish (nothing close to 30 min. on the box).  It's not neccessarily longer with more players (you can plan less, so you should think less), but I was said that with 4 players it's chaotic (and I can surely imagine that).  3 players - I don't know.

Non-annoying game, so rating=6."

Now, 5 years later, I find Traders of Osaka (only setting is changed) rather arbitrary and mechanical design.  There is nothing that attracts me to it.  Hence the rating is lowered.

Cards are money or cards are goods  that get delivered. As cards are collected as goods, corresponding ships move foward. When they reach port, they deliver. Ships close to delivery sink. Some of the cards in hand as money can be used for insurance to save goods on sinking ships. Cards that ship turn into points using a strange formulation. Anyway, it's okay. It's perhaps significant that I played it a long time ago under a different name and didn't really remember it.

1 play (4 players) - didn't seem to have enough control.  Couldn't see past a strategy of getting money early to give yourself the flexibility of taking any chances for good scoring that came your way and then hoping you got those opportunities.  Game finished with a bit of a whimper.

It's hard to grasp the subtleties of this game just from reading the rules. At its heart, this is a press-your-luck game. You invest in a certain good, then you try to ensure that the good will eventually pay off before getting stolen by pirates. Almost every time there is a payoff in a color, one or two other colors are stolen and become losses. There are a lot of sly decisions to be made to help your cause or hurt your opponents by delaying their pay day and opening them up to risk. A very narrow line exists between payoff and loss and dancing around that line sustains a fine degree tension from beginning to end. On the downside, sometimes the distribution of cards can hurt your ability to control or manipulate outcomes. It's great when it happens, but it won't happen every game.

Though the theme is very ho-hum, the artwork is quite nice (in the new Z-Man version, anyway), making for a unique and engaging game.  The ship track seems a little too short, making it very difficult to plan, but I think that further play should help us figure out what the best way is to try and slow down other players.  Our first game was still pretty close, with a power play at the end that completely changed the course of the game.

The game has some interesting mechanisms, cool nuances: the black wave, the market, the insurance... but I feel like too often, the scoring mechanism smooths out all the nuances and get you the same results despite outplaying others.

Have no love for this one.  Played it once (with 4 players) and was honestly itching for it to end after a while.  It probably didn't help that the owner of the game took waaaay too long to teach the game and then narrated every move as we played and it took far longer than it should have, I'm sure.  A nearby table played an entire game of Ticket to Ride before we even started our game because of the long teaching session we were getting.  (I should add that the game is far from complicated.)  This surely jaded my enjoyment of the game, but I am also not a fan of the infamous "trading in the Mediterranean" theme, so that counted against it, as well.  Not the worst game ever, but just not my style.

Nice mechanics and good art work for this small game. The deceptively easy rules/options require several games before you scratch the surface of the strategy. 2-3 players seem good. 4 players of similar skill can also work well.

Watch out for the really big score - one big score can pretty much win the game for someone if you allow opponents to develop the chance.

Rating after only one play, I feel like this has got more depth than immediately obvious, putting aside the slightly confusing mechanism for retaining goods for later scoring.

Fantastic little 2-4 player card game involving buying goods and shipping them to Carthage for points. Cards can be taken from the market as cash, or bought from the market as goods.

I was initially enamored by this game, but over time my rating for this game has slowly slipped.  The game plays well from 2~4, but it feels like the game mostly comes down to luck with the scores being typically very close.  While there are some nifty mechanisms, money is typically too tight to allow for anything more than mindlessly taking more money until one can buy the market.  I feel this game was on the cusp of really being an amazing lighter game.  I still hold out hope that there is a strategy point I am missing on this game.

08/16/08 Played a three-player game, once. The game works, but I find it uninteresting and mediocre. Tactical instead of strategic is fine. But ToC seemed so tactical it’s chaotic. Allegedly a 30-minute game. Our outing (new to all) took an hour. And it sure wore out its welcome with me. There seemed to be a large element of you really only made out well if the guy to your right plays a sub par game / doesn‘t know what he‘s doing (ala Puerto Rico). The components look nice. I’ll play it again some time to see if my opinion changes. 09/13/08 Played a two-player game. A little more control, as there was only one person manipulating the market in between my turns, helped me like the game a bit more.

This game packs a lot of decision making in a small box and short play time. The race to sell goods and earn points is punctuated by periods of extreme tension when ships carrying your goods are threatened by pirates. Timing of purchases is everything in this game.

RATING: 7
I like this game a lot. It doesn't get the high amazing 9s and 10s because it feels like more choices could have been added and it's somewhere between "filler" and "reason to organize a gaming session". However, when I'm in the mood for 2 player non-cutthroat light strategy, this game is the one I pull out. Still a lot of game theory involved, considering what your moves do and how they open up your opponents choices. Great purchase.

*edit* After buying this, I've realized my itch to play Mr Jack Pocket has all but died. The only thing that game does is play in a very short time (and it fits in your pocket). Aside from this, ToC does everything MJP does but better.

*edit Sept 7* I'm selling this as I feel that the hour or so this plays in, there are others that do it better. MJP is also on the chopping block but the 10 or so dollars I could get for it and its very short playtime (and it is a good game) makes me reconsider my decision.

A very interesting little game - simple options to choose between, but so many effects to consider each time.
Mostly played 2-player; with 4 players it seems a bit too random.

Fun game.  Think it would be more strategic with 2.  My only play was with 4.  A little random with 4 and kingmaking is very possible with 4, even if not intended.  Great bits.  Played with 2.  Think it is much more strategic, but still a lot of luck.

A fun set collection, risk management, take that style game. Like many smaller games this game uses multi-use cards, so sometimes teaching can be slightly confusing. But it still makes a great filler game although some players do not like the take that. I usually recommend this when its a lighter game night with a smaller player count.

What a bizarre little game!  I had two of my buddies at the table with me, both of whom are very good players, and none of us could figure out what the optimal strategies were for the first half of the game.  When things started clearing up for us, the attitude around the table was clearly, "OK, so what?"  Not a good sign for the future prospects of a game in my collection.

There's a lot more here than meets the eye; lots of interesting decisions, mostly meaningful ones at that!  The negatives are the prouction values are a little lacking - the cards are quite sticky, and too small.  Also the startup was so strongly remeniscent of Alhambra, that I was prepared to hate the game as a blatant rip-off.  Fortunately, the rest of the game plays out quite differently.  The theme is a pretty thin veneer, particularly the whole attacked by pirates bit, but good enough to spice the game up a little.

Traders of Carthage has recently been introduced to my lunchtime gaming group and has proven to be a big hit. It has pretty much everything we’re looking for in that it takes 2-4, good components, easy setup, fun theme, good iplayer interaction and challenging gameplay. It also plays to a conclusion in less than half an hour and is reasonably simple to learn, but has enough variables going on that each game is quite different. Delightfully, Traders of Carthage plays well, but differently, with two, three or four. I really do enjoy this game and recommend it without hesitation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game has some very slight card-play decisions where the choices are basically pretty obvious.  Therefore, unless someone at the table is making crazy mistakes, your position in the game is dominated by the way the cards flip into the market.  There is actually very little to control in this game. The result is a push-your-luck game where you don't so much push but instead just let things happen around you.

Sounds like a great little game for 2 players.

You acquire cards from a market that are used to either purchase cards for goods or move your ship toward Carthage and payday.

Mathy. Multiply highest numbered card of a color by the number of cards of that color, round up to the next multiple of 5 and divide by 5 to get points. If previously played that color, add 1 to the highest card.

So much game in this little box. Complex decisions at every turn as you try to accumulate goods and race the ships with your coloured goods to their destination, If timed correctly you can scuttle your opponents ships in the black tide but you're just as likely to sacrifice some of your goods in the process. A lot of blocking in this game but done quite cleverly. Beautiful design too.

Players are managing commodities in the market. There are four types of goods, with three different values: 2, 3, and 5. The cards can be picked up to be used as cash, or bought to push ships towards Carthage to trigger a payday. Ships caught in a pirate port could cause a player to lose cards unless they discard the right cards to protect them. It's a fairly easy game to learn and play. Only played once.

Slightly deranged marketplace game which is just about unique enough to stick its nose in front of the crowd. The reserving mechanism is an ideal strategic addition which stops the whole thing becoming routine, and the piracy a devilish twist and comeback tool.

Played only 2 players game. 
Interesting game with several mechanics that you have to combine in the "golden way": take card and use it for money or better buy card and increase price and goods amount, but try to avoid pirates or pay cards to save your goods from pirates. Sounds easy, but it's not so easy when you play. I like this game very much! 
And please, don't judge this game from the first play!

An excellent card game that plays like a boardgame. The cards have 4 different purposes, similar to in Oltre Mare. The decisions on what to take from the Market and what to leave for other players are delicious. There is a surprising amount of control on what ships actually sail. I'm surprised that this is the last of the Japan Brand games that Z-man are picking up.

[b]Traders of Osaka[/b] was sold via auction auction 9/22/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]My daughter Madeline and I had a lot of fun playing Traders and for some reason I decided to sell it during an auction (thinking I had too many card games). Looking back it may not be a game that would get played a lot, but I would enjoy the occasional play of Traders and my daughter really liked it. It is a great take on set collection, hand management and knowing when to play cards to move ships to score points yourself while trying to screw your neighbor. That interaction sets the game apart from more multiplayer solitaire card games. Your best move isn't always scoring the most points, you need to hurt your opponent to win. Saying that this game may not be for everyone, though I suppose you could play it in a more gentle fashion.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- I love the art/Japanese theme of the second edition.
- Set up is a breeze, plays fast and is excellent with 2.
- Relatively small footprint making it an excellent pub/cafe game.
- Speaking of footprint, kudos to Z-Man for packaging this in a small box!
- This game has a lot of take that, but it's not nasty which makes it a great game to play with older kids.
- This is a simple game, but it demands planning ahead and really figuring out how to manipulate the market to make sure you benefit when boats get scored (and make sure you don't lose goods when boats get caught in the tidal waves).[/i]

Cool little game with some subtle mechanics.  With four players, I felt unable to control the flow of the game.  The game seems like it would play better with 2-3.  Simple enough rules and seems like it will play very fast with people that know the game.

Since queen's necklace is out of print, I am thinking of getting this as an alternative.  Similar games, though it seems this one has less luck, which is good.

RATING: 7
Here's a nice little card game, perhaps best to 3 players. It's a variation of drafting - either pick up a card for free to later use as gold, or purchase all cards remaining in the draft to your warehouse using the cards/gold you've picked up before. Purchases drive a timer, and after enough purchases a colour will score using a cards x face value multiplier. There's a lot of watching to assess what other players might do and that's a big consideration in whether you pick up or purchase. Which results in a lot of engagement for a quick-ish card game.

RATING: N/A
A half-hour filler that joins China in receiving the accolade 'Knizian'. There are fairly limited options for the one action you take each turn so it moves along at a great pace, but that's not to say that the choices aren't difficult. I really enjoyed trying to manipulate the ships to cash in my goods while having my opponent ruined by the pirates. I've only tried it with two players and it worked really well. I can imagine it being good with three too, though four might get a bit too chaotic.

Excellent, Cool, Colorful Wicked light-med hand management game for 2-4 gamers. Kosmos caliber. It feels like a "trading", set collection game with pick-up-and-deliver, yet it isn't typically any one of those things. Slight learning curve, but plays quick when players get the flow down. Good feel to game play. Plays slightly like a typical non-intuitive Knizia game, but is better. Cards have multiple uses as currency, goods, protection, and (hopefully) VPs. Super fun 2 player. Sleeved this one. I haven't played 3 or 4 players, yet.

AP alert. Not a gateway game. 

I'm glad this got reprinted, but I prefer the Traders of Carthage art and graphics.

Love the artwork on the card, the vibrant colors, the mini board. It's really cute and very portable. The pink wooden score counter is an odd choice for a player color. The game can result in ap if you're not careful, but it has surprising depth for the simplicity of the rules. Good two player, and should scale well for more. Game ended about the time the entire deck was run through once, and there are a lot of cards.

I really liked this the one time I played initially and it lived up to its memory when I picked it up many years later. A great combo of set collection, speculation and timing.  

To me, the 2p really feels different than the 3-4 game.

There is a little luck introduced by the 2 cards coming out to refresh the market during supply, but this can mitigated using the storage feature.

I could see this becoming a 9 or 10.

Insert tossed. Cards sleeved.

RATING: 7
We played with 4 which is probably not the best way to play since you have no control when it is not your turn and thus just have to look away in order to not get frustrated. At 2 or 3 I hear it is better, but the mechanics are still fun and simple enough that you don't need to overthink. Collect cards to make sets which also move boats and when the boat reaches Osaka you score based on the cards value and the number of cards you have. You can really block others, hence the frustration, but that is the whole point of the game, so frustrating, but in a good way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a good game that combines hand management, set collection, and a simple trading economy. The market mechanism combined with the ability to reserve cards allows players opportunities to thwart and frustrate plans of their opponents. Timing is crucial to playing well. The only reason I do not rate it higher is that the game can drag a bit and occasionally overstay its welcome.

This game felt a little like Kawasaki's other well-known game, R-Eco, in that it was a card game with wacky rules.  It wasn't too intuitive at first, but as the game went on, I could definitely see that it was a good strategic game.  A good light-medium card game, but I'd recommend being taught by someone who already knows the rules.

[after one play] I got totally left in the dust in my first game. If this was due to poor play on my part I'm interested in trying again since it seems like there were some fun decisions being made.

Very mechanical but interesting to play. The decisions to stop others from scoring seem to be clearer than the ones you take to score yourself.

RATING: 7
This is a pleasant push your luck game that feels similar to Jaipur. On your turn, you are collecting a card from the central area to use as dollars, or buying all the cards in the central area to try to score them for their color. Each time a color is added to a players score area, the matching colored boat sails along the little map, until finally someone adds cards to their scoring area which results in one or more of those boats making it to the end of the track. At this point, boats that didn't make it to the end get pushed back a little, and players lose a card or two from their scoring area of those failed colors. Then they add cards of the boats that did make it to their scoring pile. The math by which you calculate how many points you get for a stack is a little strange, but in general I think this is a nice game, at least with 2 players.

An ok light-ish card game. There is a fair amount of strategy and interesting things to think about, but the strategies that emerge from the rules are pretty opaque (especially at first), and it's sometimes hard to figure out which moves you could make that would actually benefit you in the end.

Light, quick, but not shallow card game of buying and delivering fish across the Med. The rules from Japon Bond are in poorly phrased English due to a weak translation but can be sorted out with a bit of effort.

Having now played the Z-man version I found this to be a quick, fast playing, game of card management and timing. Half the time the choice is obvious but the other half of the time the choice is more interesting and as the turns play very fast the interesting choices return quickly. Bottom line - I had fun both times I've played.

The game has several interesting concepts, and good bit of player competition.
 
A drafting component where you have to build up money for purchases or protection. 
A set collection component where you buy goods, a sort of auction, where you are removing items which which changes the value and interest on the market, collecting strength to buy. 
What is purchased impacts the movement to payoff, you can push your interests and try to get your opponents to just close enough to be pirated - so they have to burn yet more cards.

So you see your decision has several layers to it. 
It is important to observe what your opponents are collecting so you act accordingly.

Only played a handful of times so far. Still deciding if we like it. Giving it a 7 because I think that's where it will end up.

= 2012-10-07 - R: 7 -> 8

Played again last week and was surprised by some new strategies. There's a lot more you can do to control things than I originally thought. We had a very tense battle to the end. We took more advantage of the ability to protect goods from pirates, went out of our way to get opponent goods pirated, and optimized our goods collecting to take advantage of bonus tiles. Increasing rating to an 8 as I think I'll be requesting this more often now.

One of the missus' favourite games - because she almost always wins. I like it too despite my propensity to lose. For a small box game, this has an astonishing level of depth. The player doesn't have many options on his turn, but the consequences of any given action are numerous. Can be a real brain-burner.

Initial rating based on two plays.  Interesting, but I need to play it a few more times to see just [i]how[/i] interesting.

I like it better as a 2-player game.

Update: Yes - Brilliant 2 Player game.  Excellent lunch hour game!

This really does not scale well.  In a 2 player game, there is some real thought required when making a move.  The cause and effect relationship is much more clear in a 2 player game.  You make moves to screw your opponent as well as help yourself.  In a 3 or 4 player game, you're simply playing tactics to make the best play you can for yourself.

As a 2 player game, I rate it an 8.5
As a 3 or 4 player game, I rate it a 6.5

This game is simple to play.  There are only three basic actions: take a card to use as money, take a bunch of cards as goods and pay for them with your money, or reserve one card for your exclusive use as a card or a good.  It seems simple, but there are a lot of varied options for screwing over the other players by forcing them to throw away their goods at stratigically advatageous times.  

Traders of Carthage uses the cards as money and goods mechanic like Race for the Galaxy but it more interesting in Race because there are strategic reasons for keeping certain cards.  There is no reason to keep a particular card in Traders of Carthage other than if it would cause you to over pay.  

The scoring is a little wonky and I am still not sure that I understand it.  That was my least favorite aspect of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Nice card game with small board. All about purchasing goods to sell at Carthage. The cards are used as money if in your hand or goods when 'purchased' & put on the table. Timing of the scoring is important, especially if the other goods ships are in pirate waters! Make sure you can store goods to keep from losing them.

Jogo com sabor muito indefinido, que tão depressa encanta como desilude, facto para o qual não contribuem as falhas técnicas da segunda edição (como a orientação do mapa, a dificuldade de distinguir os valores das cartas e o próprio design das mesmas). É um jogo de "facada" simples, que podia ser apresentado como um pouco mais, pois o pressuposto é excelente e a jogabilidade também, o que o torna aquele jogo bom, que facilmente poderia ser bestial!

RATING: 7
It's a very nice, compact game. Easy to learn and doesn't take long to play. There's not a whole lot of game in the box, but that's part of the appeal: this is a simple economic trading game that does what it sets out to do, and nothing more.

Starting this at a 7, because we found our first (2 player) game slow, but not in a bad way, more in a 'there are a lot of things to consider' way.  I think this one will go up over time.

I love card games where the cards have multiple uses. Makes for some tough choices. I have found I prefer this game with 2, or at most 3 players. With 4 there is not enough control. Truly an excellent 2 player experience. I just wish my gf would agree to play it more often,

It's like all the games I've always had! Even before I was done reading the rules this game just clicked, similar to the way Sobek did. It doesn't need a theme at all and that's fine because I don't care about the theme. The cards are pretty and the game is fun, and there are only about five rules!

After playing a few more times...it just doesn't have the zip or zest that some of the other games like it have. We'll keep trying, but it's not so lemony fresh.

RATING: 5.5
This is a game which is not very intuitive. It acts like a strategy game which begs you to try and plan in advance several turns, while only giving you extremely limited tactical short-term options. Your fate is left to the draw of the deck and other people's draws. So it's really a chaotic tactical game where you do the best with whatever options are in front of you on your turn and hope that the way the cards come out compliments the choices you made on previous turns.

One interesting quirk in this game, that I don't really like, is the way it can punish you for doing something different than the other players. For instance, to get a ship into scoring position, it's much easier if multiple players put effort into buying those cards. This encourages multiple players going after the same color(s). If you try to go after a different color, there is a very good chance the group will collectively draw your color which not only stalls your boat's progress but helps to ensure that their color advances on the board. So your best option seems to be to join the group, going after the same colors as your opponents. I don't necessarily like feeling forced to do what the group does.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Tiny package holds a very tense game.  More than just trying to buy the most goods, a lot of thought about manipulating the ship movements to avoid the pirate's, not handing a deal to your left hand player, when to reserve a space adds a nice tension to each turn but still very playable in about 30 minutes.

RATING: 9
I'm very impressed with this game. It has some simple actions but each choice impacts what cards other players get, which cards can score, which cards might be lost, if you're going to be able to buy the cards or they will, can you protect your cards from being lost at sea, etc. So far I've only played it at two players, and it works very well for 2, where the game is just as much about what you deny your opponent as what you take for yourself.

Which is the only negative I can see for this game, is that it's just mean enough that some audiences wouldn't enjoy it. But there seemed to be enough in the game to help mitigate it a bit, and other players could just as easily be caught up in it as well, including the instigator.

Components are pretty nice, although the green ship token blends in with the sea in lower lighting. I actually thought I had lost the piece midgame.

The small size of the game box makes it very easy to bring to game nights, and it's a pretty meaty game for it's small size.

There is a lot of game in this small box. I didn't expect the game can be this deep after reading the rule. Oh boy. There are only three choices on your turn but each choice can affect the game quite significantly. There are so many things to consider before making each decision. Like, should I buy all the goods but then it will advance the boats that i don't want to move. Or if that's the case, do i have enough insurance cards for the goods? or should I get a card so I have more money or leave the most expensive good and hopefully i can buy it later? and on and on. There are just alot to think about. After the first game. I still don't have a good idea what strategy is the best. We played a 3 player game and I didn't expect my 7 year old to get the game but he wanted to try and somehow he won :)

RATING: 6
Played only 2P games of this so far. Traders of Carthage plays like a deeper, longer version of Jaipur, although my opponents pointed out it also shares similarities to Finca. At its heart, Traders of Carthage is an abstract, numbers-only set collection game with a rather quirky scoring method. Like Jaipur, there are two hands to be managed and there is a fine balancing act in managing both. 

However, I find the game's pacing a little problematic. Unless 2 ships hit payday simultaneously, the game has a tendency to feel drawn out in getting to 8 achievement tokens. (It still finishes within the printed 30 minutes, but it just [i]feels[/i] long.) Also, the gameplay seems mechanical - players collect coins, then splurge on the market. Rinse and repeat. Any tension is built up too little too slowly. The artwork is lovely, although I personally prefer the cheery colours of India more.

RATING: 8
2016: n/a.  Will rate after a few more plays but this is really really strong.  The game scoring is funky, but so long as one person understand and the rest know generally how to increase they're score, it's fine.  The game looks beautiful and the game play matches.  Lots of really interesting subtleties going on where different actions can have multiple consequences.  Plenty of "a ha" moments as you realize the implications.  The correct move is never truly obvious!

RATING: 7
A home made offering from Japan. The components are clearly 'game kit' style. The board is laminated, the cards look like colour photocopies on thick stock. What about gameplay?

Players draft cards from the marketplace. These are then used to either purchase merchandise from the marketplace or protect bought merchandise from pirates. A corresponding coloured ship gets pushed towards Carthage when its merchandise is purchased.Once ships touch Carthage, they are scored by multiplying the quantity of goods owned by the highest good value. 

There are other elements tossed into the mix: ships on pirates spaces get hit unless owners can discard some cards to 'store' them. Players can also 'control' the market by using their reservation chip. There are also bonus  1 value chits that increase the multiplier factor.

The system works well when put together and there is some control: you are trying to work the marketplace to your advantage while pushing other players' interests towards the pirates. The trick is to ensure that you push boats that you have interests in towards carthage but also keeping 'storage' cards for protection. A decent filler.

(Played solo twice for learning purposes- proper rating and commenting soon to follow. But, as a first impression, it offers quite some brainburning for it's tiny and very portable size!)

UPDATE> Played the game, it is a very well designed game that's for sure but it seems to have this effect that Mr.Jack and Reef Encounter had to us: we can understand the concepts and strategy, we play the game but there is something missing, something to get us involved and interested. It's really weird and I cannot explain it better, we both have a "so what?" feeling when we perform our actions. Like the games mentioned above, this is a good game and obviously it is just not our cup of tea, but it may very well be the best for others so give it a try. In any case, for me it's much better than the other two.

Card, Hand Management. I quite enjoyed my first play of this. The rules are rather simple, but there seems to be a lot of strategy in deciding when to take cards vs buy merchandise, and different ways to use your reservation token to manipulate ship movement. Good hand management game. Looking forward to more plays.

Another trade victim in the great purge of '12.

Edit: I had the original Traders of Carthage version. They share the same database entry, so does that mean there were no gameplay differences?

Have one game played - learned with my dad.  I think the rating would go up with 3 or 4 players.  It's a nice 2P game, but it's a little easier to set up what you think you can buy and how much merchandise you can get with 2.  With more, that would become more tricky.

Nekem teljesen Jaipur érzésem volt a játék közben, de ez attól eltérően 2-4 fős. A játékosok vagy elvesznek egy terméket a piacról, amit kézbe véve pénzként használhatnak vagy megveszik az összes szabad terméket a piacról a kezükből használt pénzek segítségével. A vásárláskor 1-2 mozognak az adott színű hajók a célváros felé. Amikor egy hajó eléri a célvárost az adott színű termék a végső raktárunkba kerül. Az hogy ebből mennyi darab arra van egy érdekes számolás a játékban, ami szerintem felesleges. Amilyen színben árut raktak el a játékosok kapnak egy jelzőt. 8 után van vége a játéknak. Egy plusz elem a lefoglaló kereskedő, akivel lehet taktikázni kicsit. Jól kitalált játéknak tűnt, de úgy éreztem kimondottan ketten lehet jó, mert többen simán királycsinálás lehet benne.

RATING: 4
There is nothing particularly wrong with the game, but I found it to be a bit processional as you are just drafting cards for currency/protection or for points.  The design is undoubtedly clever and works, but found that the design was more clever than any play that you could actually perform.  Mostly you are constrained by what cards are available, and what cards you get beaten out on.  I was waiting for the twist, and there just didn't seem to be any.  Games like this shine when the decisions you make are based on timing, here if you have the option to score, it always seems best to do so unless it is clear (and one glance will tell you when it is clear) that another player will score much more than you.  

I fear that while there are decisions to make about drafting, you can't know whether they were good choices until a couple turns later.  So most of my game was spent with me thinking, "Well, I guess it was a good thing I did that last turn" or "Gee, how could I have planned for that?"  Hindsight is 20/20, but with the limited options available and no clear way of predicting of what will score and what will be pirated, it feels like your game is caught and trampled in the rippling results of other people trying to play their own game, scoring the best for themselves.

Traders is in the quick-playing 2p card game genre, except there's a board and it's capable of playing more than 2p.  There's certainly luck involved, but a look-ahead market akin to Power Grid's smoothes out its effects.  The game might be a bit repetitive for its length.  The rating is tentative.

As our game unfolded I realized there are several levels to the strategy, most of which I had missed, including using the achievement tokens to your advantage, carefully watching the market, taking cards for money instead of points, and when to use your reserve token, amongst others.  They all do interrelate well too, blending together for a fun game that plays faster than it looks.  I'd like to play at least a couple more times to get a better feel.

With four players it felt more like "what will the other players let me do this turn" as opposed to "what do I want to do this turn"

Also, in our one game a player had six points fall into his lap on the last turn. That's huge in this game. Made me wonder, "Why did I spend the last thirty minutes playing this game just for THAT to happen."

Reacquired in the summer of 2014.  Looking to trade it away.

I'm sure I'm missing something because my opinion seems to be in the minority, but I just don't see what the fuss is about.  I've owned it and tried it twice and It's just not fun.

Based on 2 player experiences only, this game really does the trick for me. There is enough strategy in here for me to dub this the best of all short trading games ever. For now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
tl;dr: surprisingly effective

This definitely is one of those small, nifty games that are bigger then you expect them to be. It's a deck of cards, a tiny board and some markers. But the way you have to balance taking cards as money and buying the right goods at the right time to score the most points and not risk loosing what you've been gathering is just brilliant. Ever turn new, hard choices have to be made... unless you're out of money, and there's a 5 available.
Yeah, if you haven't played this and like short, small(ish) games with good amounts of strategy, definitely give this a shot.

This is one of those games that didn't click until we played it. I was thinking it would go right to the 'to trade' pile once we tried it out but it was actually a lot more complex (and I don't just mean the janky way the goods are sold) and interesting than I though it would be.  Perfect for the whole 'the kid's in the bed, let's get a game out before sleeping' time slot at the end of a workday.

RATING: 7.7
A clever hand management/timing/resource game that really is almost entirely non-thematic but a clever little game.

It feels like it could have easily been a Knizia or Feld game and that's a great compliment.

Update: Though it is pretty tough to pull away and score significantly more points in this game than other players, there is definitely scope here for clever play. I like it a little more each time I play it, though I'm undecided on whether I prefer it as a 2 or a 3 player game. The chaos with that third player is sometimes just enough and sometimes just a little too much. With 2 however it can be a little cut-throat.

Rating up from 7 to 7.7.

This game might get really interesting after you've had 5+ games to get a grasp of the flow, but I don't have the patience to go that far when there are so many other 2 player games I'd rather be playing.  It might do what it does very well, but I want to do something else.

I've only played as a two-player game. It's enjoyable, but not necessarily intuitive (not a negative per se). What I'm wondering is about control and ability to plan ahead, which seems opaque. I've heard that control is less with multiple people, which worries me. Then again, I've been wrong in the past. The bottom line is that it just doesn't grab me even if it's a solid game. I'd really like to play with three and four before making my final decision.

This is a fun filler game that plays in about 30 minutes, even with a rules explanation for new players. It's simple enough to learn quickly, but learning the strategy of timing plays correctly gives the game surprising depth.

RATING: 6
There's a lot going on in this very small game, so further plays are definitely needed to see where my rating shakes out. The concepts are pretty simple, but players have so many choices and opportunities to influence the outcome that I suspect it will take quite a few tries to grasp all possible strategies. And that's a very good thing ... I'm certainly intrigued by this game and looking forward to exploring just how deep the design goes. Update: My opinion holds: Trader of Carthage remains simple and streamlined, but manages to offer interesting choices to players. And, I've discovered this plays fairly well with two players, which is a good thing. However, my introduction to this game was with the original Japon Brand edition, and I was hoping some company would republish game up and jazz up the components. Z-Man Games did pick it up, but the Z-Man edition has lackluster graphics and components (though the cards seem of good quality), which is a bit of a disappointment and doesn't help in getting people excited to play. Still, this one is interesting enough to remain in my collection despite being more of a good game than great.

Played several times with 2 or 3 players. Very interesting card game that allows for strategic and tactical play. As with every card game, there is a significant luck element, but there are a lot of ways around it with smart play. Seems to have a lot of subtlety that reveals itself with more play. Just as good with 2 players as with 3.

One of the earlier multi-function card games and also one of the publisher's most efficient titles, Traders of Carthage comes up short by today's standards.  The market rules are intriguing and the five-function cards are gorgeous.  But the game is repetitive.  Inevitably, players cycle through the sensation of being stuck in a rut.

Not bad. We noticed that it always seems like a good move to take a 5-coin card into your hand whenever available. This is a shame because despite this obvious move, there is a lot of subtlety and nuance in the rest of the game.

So far I have only played this as a 2 and 3 player game and I can see why it is recommended for lower player counts: it would be much too unpredictable as a 4 player game so I don't plan to play it that way.

Also I still prefer Jaipur, a game to which this is often rightfully compared.

RATING: 6
A clever and well-balanced game is in here, if you can look past the amateurish graphic design (now much improved in the Z-Man edition!) and confusion of the three different uses of one set of cards.  Feels like it should be the central mechanism for a bigger game.

RATING: 4
Lacks any real "fun factor".  The "take it all" aspect of the game becomes tedious, and the theme pisses me off.  Why call it "traders" when you never f'ing trade any-f'ing-thing with each other.  I call it, the un-fun version of bonanza.

Light set-collection game. Didn't really meet my expectations after the first play. My wife and I had no idea if our moves were clever, or stupid, or even if they made sense. It didn't seem to matter in the end, as our scores were the same, and we each had the same number of chips, so we tied. Yipee.

6-30-10 Update: Another play, and the lights are starting to turn on. We neglected to use the chips in scoring the first time, which changes things a bit. Also, it's important to have lots of cards in your hand so you have some control of things. Looking forward to more plays.

Traders of Carthage is a 2006 game designed by Susumu Kawasaki, who also did R-Eco, Gra Gra Company (i.e., Stack Market), and Master of Rules, all of which have been published domestically by Z-Man. I’ve always enjoyed trying the German-style games that Japanese designers have to offer and am especially a fan of Satoshi Nakamura’s Fairy Tale. However, I was particularly impressed with how solid Traders of Carthage felt. It seemed highly play-tested for a Japanese game, which are notoriously rough around the edges and quirky. The cards were nicely balanced like in Knizia’s Blue Moon City with the lower value cards having a benefit to offset their value and the card drafting mechanic was clever and clearly fine-tuned and developed to make it function smoothly. I’m tempted to pick up a copy of the game, but am just not sure if I see it getting much play given how crowded the market is with games of this duration and complexity level.

An accessible gem with 2-players. Highly tactical shares game, and it rewards the discipline to set up the long term play as well as forcing your opponent to help you. The dual purposed cards (goods and money) with the beautiful mapboard and boats is simple genius.

A splendid couples or cafe game. Highly portable with the easeof play but thinky moments of a game like Biblios, and it mitigates the luck of the draw with a nice lookahead mechanic.

Hand management game in a small box that plays more like a board game than a card game. Each turn you pick a card or reserve one, and when you pick cards you have to decide if you use them as money or merchandise. Meanwhile, buying merchandise advances the coloured ships and if one reaches the end, it is payday for the merchandise of the same color. A nice twist is, that this leads any other ships on pirate fields to be plundered!
I like to game, although I must admit that the theme is not very appealing and it takes a lot(!) more time to play than the 30 minutes mentioned on the box. Unfortunately, my girlfriend did not like it very much. Pity.

RATING: 6
Wanted to like this game but ended up being a bit deflated. This is the second game now by Susumu Kawasaki that I am disappointed with with R-Eco being the first. Traders is not a bad game, just very repetitive and very dry. We must have played through 20 turns in a two player game before the game ended with 8 tokens. Through it all, there were a few times where I was thrilled by a smart play either from me or my opponent. So there is room for clever play especially when deciding when to use the reserve token. Beyond that, the game is just drawing and playing cards from a deck and hoping that the right card comes up when needed. You can indeed get hosed by a bad draw of colors.

I think the biggest drawback for the game is length. For a game with 2, it took us an hour to complete. That is a bit too long and it drags unnecessarily. I believe reducing to 6 tokens maybe sufficient. Still, I rated this game a 6 meaning that I would gladly play this game with others when requested and it is an ok game.

I really like this as a fairly quick 3 player game.  There is very little down time once players are familiar with the turn options, there is good player interaction, as what you do directly affects the other players, and there is a decent amount of screwage potential with the pirates.  I definately want to get this out a few more times soon.  The 4 player game leaves you with a feeling of having no control, so this one will only be played with 2 or 3.

Silly game, but pretty good.  There's really subtle interactions between players, and it's as much about making sure your opponents don't get what they need as it is about scoring for yourself.  There's just the right amount of luck here.  Not so much that the game gets crazy, but enough that you can't count on one perfect strategy to win every game.  The theme is paper thin here, and the board is particularly unnecessary.  Still, this is short enough that it doesn't overstay its welcome.  Not bad for a filler.

First play - Four players - Game seemed too chaotic and out of my control to score well. Maybe with increased understanding of how to block and play my hand properly it may add enjoyment to the game.

This is a weird little game.  I think I mean that in a good way.  Like R-Eco, the designer's other game, it has an odd way of manipulating the cards in the game to get what you want out of what's available, and it has some other interesting little scoring mechanisms thrown in the mix to make it something unique.  For its size and price tag, you might not expect it to be a brain-burner, but figuring our how to manipulate the market is a neat little challenge.  I'm hooked for now.  I'll have to see if it has any staying power.

You are traders in the bustling commerce city of Carthage, buying goods at Market and selling them to overseas merchants. But if you want to prosper, be careful of pirates!
\13\\13\
Players buy goods or grab coins in the market while cards in the farm replenish the market. When goods are bought, ships move toward Carthage. When a ship reaches Carthage, a payday occurs, where that particular merchandise is sold. Any ships on pirate spaces get raided and you must discard cards with storage icons to try and save your merchandise.
\13\\13\
Achievement tokens increase the value of your merchandise and when someone has gotten 8 or more such tokens the game is over.

I don't know if it was because we played with three players but I found that the selling went very fast and the other goods always got attacked by pirates. This was frustrating, discouraging, and repetitive after a while. I also had a hard time balancing wanting to collect one color (for maximal pay off) with wanting to diversify your interests (in case of pirates). My biggest complaint was that it was very hard for my mind to process that the cards in my hand are not, and never will be, my goods.

Wow. Best two player card/light board game since Scripts and Scribes. It really amazes me with how much strategy is packed into a little box. Taking a card as money can mean so many things - Need the money? Preventing a ship from getting to carthage? Getting pirate insurance?

Keeping control of which ships go where, so you get big loads into carthage while your opponent is attacked by pirates when they have no defense, is very tense.

I have only played two player. I would guess that it would become more chaotic with 3 or 4 players.

This is a great little game - lots of depth in a small package.  The cards numbered 2, 3, or 5 have four different purposes: they are needed for set collection, they count as money for buying the sets, they can be used to protect your sets, and in the end they are the victory points.  Nothing unique in the elements themselves, though it is all put together in a unique way with meaningful tactical decisions throughout.

This may be best with two as it becomes a long game with more.

Great game!

Another unique card game from the innovative folks at Japon Brand.  I really like how the movement of the ships is dictated by the amount of its respective goods purchased from the market.  As well as how they can be protected from pirates if you discard the correct cards from your hand.  Very light, plays relatively quick and there are even opportunities to screw with other people's plan.  The calculation of the how much currency/cards you receive as victory points from the sale of your goods is somewhat overly complicated though.

Rather strange and complex card game, with an intricate scoring system. Cards are both used as money and as goods. Buying good from the market causes the boats carrying those specific goods to advance. If one boat reaches Carthage, that good will score (for all players) but the boats on the pirate spaces are instead raided.

Probably best on three.

A quirky, yet clean and efficient card game that plays in a fairly abstract way, but offers some interesting tactical choices. I've played with 2 and 3 players - both those configurations work well. I've heard 4 players isn't as good, but haven't tried. Too many other 4-player games to bother.
The game can be a little hard to wrap your head around, but for most players, it clicks around the midway point into the first game.

RATING: 6
Downgraded the rating after a few plays. We're finding that the best way for us to win is for each player to max out their special power. For instance, the Explorer should mine for resources heavily, the Champion should commit to fighting the Athenians. Unfortunately, it makes for a dull game after a while. This is, apparently, a bigger problem with fewer players. Regardless, this one doesn't have the longevity we had hoped, especially since Forbidden Island is essentially the same genre but is over in a fraction of the time.

RATING: 7
Definitely hard. A lot of push your luck aspect. Actually, there's more luck than I would like, since you really need good dice rolls to get the resources, or you're pretty screwed. Also, mystic tokens really help because you need them to slow down the sinking early so you have better chances of getting stuff. Overall, not bad, but more random than many co-ops and so you need more luck than anything if you hope to win.

I wasn't expecting much: reading the rules made me think of a Stone Age clone. And setup is fiddly, which wasn't very encouraging... but I had a lot of fun! Gameplay is smooth, the urgency is palpable and the options are nice. A cool surprise!

Something that Atlantis Rising does right is to ratchet up the tension right from the start.  On turn one you will see chunks of the island disappear under the waves (the chunks with the most accessible resources to boot), the Athenians will invade, and you will start cursing your luck with the die rolls and card draws.  In addition, the contest between us and the system does seem nicely balanced. 

However, I agree with others who have commented that the character abilities do tend to enforce specialisation, doing one task for most of the game.  And what we're doing after an initial rush to get more workers is either simple resource harvesting or piling meeples into the Athenian war.  Neither task is particularly engrossing.  

Production quality and artwork are both pretty decent.

RATING: 6
Cooperative game where players are trying to build a machine that will save Atlantis. It is a race against time. You need to gather the materials fast and keep an eye on the attacking force. There is a lot of luck because you gather the materials using dice but you can decide how much to gamble. Its not a bad game but in general I dont find pure co-op games very exciting.

RATING: 8
We played twice.
It's a cooperative game in which we're trying to construct a cosmit gate to transport Atlantis off Earth to save it from the rising flood waters. However, said rising flood waters makes it hard to do this as the resources needed to build our construction are lost. To top it off, the Athenians are taking advantage of our crisis by attacking us, thus wasting people that would be better off trying to gather resources and build.

We played both games on normal difficulty which basically just defines how difficult it is to build the different pieces of our gate. The first game went horrendously bad due to a combination of bad luck (there are dice rolls and card draws), and poor tactics. We didn't play well as a team, and were ineffcient in our actions. 

The second game went much better as we played a little smarter in our choices, and took actions to better mitigate and control the randomness. Still, we weren't perfect and ended up barely losing the game. 

All in all, it was a fun co-op that definitely improved with a second play. The game felt a little harsh at times, but if it was too easy, then it wouldn't be fun. Nice mechanics, and the modular board is very nice.

I'm glad I played.

This one is tough. Too tough. The theme is great as it reminds us of Disney's "Atlantis : The Lost Empire." The push your luck element of the worker placement is certainly unique. But those Athenians & Misfortune cards are SO punishing. They hit you hard and trying to mitigate them is just as painful. In all the games we played we never even came close to winning. It is brutal. We like challenge in co-ops but when it honestly seems it is impossible to win that takes all the fun out it.

Seemed simplistic at the time, and had dice rolling to gain resources. That is a mechanic that we do not always appreciate. Cooperative play. 

Got rid of due to it being in a Game Purge (along with other dice rolling games) , but excited to hear about the new edition expected to come out in 2017-2018 with improvements.

Bought this on a whim, using some in-store point rewards.  Finally played it, after it sat for years on my shelf.  It's OK, but I don't like how you work towards buying equipment only to use it once.  The sinking is also unruly.  We played again using the following House Rules and it was much more enjoyable:  
 * Draw [# of players - 2] number of misfortune cards each turn. e.g. 3 each turn in a 5 player game.
 * Use the more difficult equipment cards.  More challenging, and more rewarding payouts.
 * Dial back the max. attack of the Athenians by one step according to the number of players.  (No one enjoys wasting sending all your workers out for this.)
 * Allow a previously purchased piece of equipment to be used again by paying 1 Mystic power with 1 worker.

Slapping you around right from the bat..not an easy one for that matter, but then again did not thoroughly enjoy it in the strict sense while playing in a 5p setting. the lack of sheer excitement (and probably the party's involvement) was somewhat mediocre. Maybe I was expecting this game to be way better than it really is..

Thanks for the present, Dave! Unfortunately, we've all decided that this didn't live up to our expectations. We heard "co-op Euro worker placement" and we jumped out of our pants a little. Good, light, never played games before Co-Op game with way less rules than Pandemic, but its really more of a stepping stone than a solid ground of gaming.

My first exposure to the game was from a random Dice Tower review. I loved the idea of the island sinking and having to race against the inevitable in a worker-placement game. When I realized it was out of print I was devastated! A few months later while visiting my parents back home I stumbled into a little over-priced game shop at the local mall and found this tucked back on the shelf. Out of print and purchased at retail!

That was great and all - but would my wife, gaming group, and I all actually enjoy the game? Yes. Simply, yes. By far our favorite worker-placement and co-op.

I've played with 2-4 players and about 8 or 9 different people. Everyone has enjoyed the game and always wants to reset after playing. Initially the game has a steep difficulty to win but remains enjoyable up until the last flood tile.

My wife and I are highly anticipating a re-print to hopefully bring some new life back into this.

I nicely put together co-op, with a perfect sense of impending dread, with the flipping tiles. 2 issues knock this down for me. 
1. Not quite enough of those complex decisions on when to use special abilities. This is what makes LotR a winner for me, and some of the simpler co-ops not so much. 
2. (And this is a biggie.) The special abilities of the players, combined with the structure of the game, conspire to make players do one thing over and over all game. There is no real reason one player cant just fight the ships the whole time, which is really boring. You want the cubes concentrated to 1-2 players, so they can buy the winning cards easier. So, in our game, 1 player got cards, 1 got men, then fought, and 2 got cubes. We did that the whole time. And won. Ok if you are ok living vicariously through the team. Boring if you want to do something interesting on your turn, and you are the fighting guy.

I was worried that this might be a bit boring and easy but I was wrong. Played a 6 player game of this and had a blast. Everyone was really involved in trying to make the machine to save Atlantis and the game moved along quickly. Sometimes trying to get resources was just impossible no matter how many dice were rolled. The flooding of parts of the island can be super frustrating too.

I like cooperative games, and I love them if they are HARD to beat! However, this game is just impossible to winâ¦ Or, I shouldnât say impossible because I actually did win one of the times, but that was with 2 players in a game in which I rolled almost nothing but 5âs and 6âs (as in seriously, I donât think I ever rolled lower than a 3, and if I did it didnât matter) and drew some lucky cards etc. â and that game was won on easy level with just a single non-flooded tile being left on the game board! With normal rolls and card draws, on anything but the easy difficulty I would have gotten destroyed! In my other game, the one with 3 players, we played pretty well I think, and got some average rolls, and we simply got smashed and finished 3 components of the required 10â¦ Sure, with 6 players the game might be easier, but I rarely play with 6 players so I cannot verify this. 

The game also uses worker placement which is my favorite game mechanic, and as I really like cooperative games I thought I would love this game. However, I did not. It simply wasnât much fun as it was so hardâ¦ You basically have to rely on good card draws and on rolling a 5 or a 6 at most of the spots, and with very few options to modify the dice rolls this gets frustrating. The rewards you get for building the components are poor so you donât really ever feel you stand a chance. As said, I like cooperative games if they are hard (I love Ghost Stories on nightmare/hell difficulty), but this game is too hard. Iâm not just basing this on my own two plays (yes, in which I ironically actually won one of them), but if you read the forum you will see that other people feel the same way.

The 6 different characters have some great powers, but some of them feel like they have predetermined jobs; one of the guys should really always fight the Athenians as his power gives him a benefit when doing so, and I think thatâs a flaw in the game. I do appreciate the designer tried to make a good, hard cooperative game with a worker placement mechanic; that could actually fill a niche I think. However, as I see it, there are many better cooperative games out there so I donât feel I need to own this game. After a couple of plays I sold it and I donât expect to play it again, even though I would like to try it with 5-6 one day just to see if itâs easier.

This is quite simply the best co-op game I've ever played. The game involves resource gathering, is perfect mechanically and can be played with kids, casual gamers, and strategy gamers alike. In your attempt to save Atlantis, you place your workers, draw misfortunes, collect your resources, fight the Athenians in one very simple step, and then build what you need to so you can save Atlantis.

RATING: 7.5
This is a pretty good co-op game, though heavier on the need for good dice rolls than I'd like.  Harder than Ghost Stories for sure - even on the Normal mode.  The Press Your Luck mechanic is slightly different in this game.  It's more like a "Take Your Chances" in terms of placing workers in vulnerable spots, so negative outcomes are easier to anticipate.

This is a good game. It's a little weird to me, combining the worker placement mechanic with a cooperative game. I've certainly played worker placement games that were better, and cooperative games that were better. So, I have mixed feelings. The first game, we were sort of competing with each other the way you do in worker placement games. The second game, we worked together more fully and planned everything together without any sense of competition at all, and it went better. 

Advise:  Focus on making babies so you all have 6 workers as quickly as possible. Have each player focus heavily on their strengths. Play with at least 4 players so you have a good selection of strengths. Draw a lot of knowledge cards. Make sure you put in enough defense against the Athenians.

Cooperative worker placement. The players each are in command of an Atlantean faction, consisting of a character with a specific ability and his/her workers. The different characters add some variability to the game play. The workers are used to collect resources (gold, crystal and ore), to transform ore into Atlantidium, to make new workers, and to obtain knowledge cards. This is achieved by placing the workers on one of the fields on the 6 land tongues constituting Atlantis and rolling a die. These land tongues are sinking, though, starting from the outer point to the middle of the island. This way the best patches of land disappear first, and it becomes increasingly difficult to obtain resources (by having to roll a higher number). These resources are needed to collect a set of cards, which together form a device by which means the Atlanteans can escape their sorry fate. Each card also gives a special ability to be used immediately when the card is constructed by handing over the mix of resources necessary to do as such. The set of cards needed to assemble the portal varies from game to game. The knowledge cards which can be collected also give a specific ability. These cards can be kept and played whenever deemed necessary during the game. The way in which Atlantis sinks is determined by a stack of disaster cards. Each player draws such a card during his or her turn. A second mechanism leading to land disappearing are attacks by Athena. Workers have to be placed on a sea battle card. Their number has to match or exceed the strength of the attack, which gets stronger as the game progresses. For each unit by which the Atlantean army is outnumbered, one part of Atlantis sinks... Land protection can be built, courage tokens can be gained to fight the Athenean attackers, and energy tokens can be obtained by means of which the die roll can be augmented (1 energy), resources can be switched (2 energy), sinking of land can be avoided (3 energy), or sunken land can be reclaimed (5 energy).

Cooperative
Atlantis Rising is a fully co-operative game in which the players must race to create a cosmic gate before all of the island tiles have been destroyed. The gate's components are variable and determine the difficulty level of the game - Easy, Normal, Hard, or Cosmic. The players must also contend with the continually escalating threat of their Athenian enemies, who may destroy one or more island tiles each turn if insufficient Atlanteans are allocated to the island's protection.

With fewer than five players, the need to devote so many meeples to defense makes the game difficult to win. The same may be true with five or six players (I haven't tried that yet.), given all the Misfortunes to withstand. The game's difficulty and your role also constrict your play, so the game gets repetitive;  you see other players doing stuff you'd like to try, but it's too risky to depart from your script. Any number of house rules can make things easier, and the designer in several threads has given his blessing to adopting some.

wish I could rate this up a bit... the theme is really strong, also, seeing the island drop into the sea bit by bit is really evocative. Also, replayability and setting the difficulty are clearly above average.

However, coops in my view need strategic planning; it's sad to see that the designers made such a poor choice of combining a strategic decision mechanism (worker placement) with a random outcome/success mechanism (rolling dice). While this keeps the tension high, it also conveys the impression that really, the game's outcome hinges on the dice more than on your skill in deciding what to do. Sadly missed opportunity.

Good cooperative game. However, in my opinion, it seems impossible to win unless you get (more than) a bit lucky with dice rolls. 

The amount of bad things that happen in this game is overwhelming and discouraging at times. As if it that wasn't enough, you have to get about half of your workers to the navy to fight Athenians, which is a bit annoying. 

The game is a great idea I think, but probably not tested enough. The difficulty of the game grows EXPONENTIALLY with the more players you have. Will try again and again but I see myself letting this one gather dust on the shelf when (if) I manage to beat it.

Most people are saying 60-ish minutes for this game.  My first play of this took about 3 hours!  That's not even including explanation, I think.  I'm not sure what went wrong but it took forever.  Basically it's a worker placement co-op where you start with few workers and resources and gain more as the game is played.  There is some push-your-luck elements as well.  Anyway, the game started off crazy hard.  Eventually we built up extra people and started abusing the knowledge cards.  I'm not 100% sure that when you go through the 31 card Knowledge deck if you reshuffle the deck or not.  We couldn't find it in the rules but we ruled that you could because it seems like it would be impossible to win otherwise.  We ended up going through the deck multiple times and eventually winning on the easiest setting.  After looking for the answer about the knowledge deck, I see that we made some minor mistakes in the rules, which might have changed how things went.  Regardless, I just don't see any long term replay value in the game for a few reasons: (1) The 'bad stuff' is boring.  The misfortune deck contains 58 cards, approximately 48 of which are 'flood X tile(s).'  The other 10 are unique and somewhat interesting.  So, in your 'bad stuff' phase each player draws/resolves a bad card then near the end of the round the Athenians attack.  If you don't defend the attack, bad stuff happens.  I would mind but this also involves flooding tiles.  I GET THAT ATLANTIS IS SINKING BUT I WANT VARIETY DAMMIT!!!  The misfortune deck should have had mostly non-flooding effects and maybe make the Athenians harder but they would be the driving force that causes floods to happen.  I don't know, just meh. (2) Unique character abilities... alright.  A deck of special cards with unique effects.  Cool.  Not so cool when you go through the special card deck multiple times in the same game.  How can it stay interesting when you are repeating the same cards over and over and over.  I don't know.  I feel towards this game the way ameritrashers feel when they complain euros... it's a soulless experience.

Right up there with Ghost Stories, which I also love.  Difficult enough that it requires a high degree of cooperation without demanding the ruthless turn optimization that Ghost Stories often does.

This is a really cutthroat co-operative game where EVERY action counts. 

You need a group-think mentality as on some turns the best you will achieve is damage control and will not advance towards the goal of building all the components, however your damage control turn prevented that bit of the island flooding which allowed player X to draw that cards which allowed player Y to gather that resource which player Z then plays a card to take that resource to allow that component to be built.

Gets really interesting once a lot of the island is flooded and hard decisions need to be made.

Like Forbidden Island, fully co-op, different levels of difficulty, land sinking into the sea. Although it sounds very similar, it is still a very different game.

There is always room on my shelf for co-ops.  There are so many people who are new to gaming, want to join in, but are afraid of looking stupid because they don't know what to do.  Easing them in with co-ops such as this one, helps give them the confidence & introduces some basic mechanics so some of them go onto other games.  And of course my hardcore gamers enjoy a good co-op too.

We are pretty seasoned players so we started with the hard level--well, one of us had played before.  We won, which surprised us, because we all thought we were in fatal trouble, but thanks to some very clever thinkers in our group, we barely squeaked by.  We hit the extra people & cards early and hard.  We kept an eagle eye on the  Athenians, and were never plundered.   I re-read the rules just to make sure we had played correctly.  

The rules are easy to learn, which is important, since there is no time to ease into the game--the island starts sinking immediately. 

The play was satisfying with constant tension which excited lots of interaction.  If someone likes a social game, this is a good one. 

My only objection is, if the recruiter does his job well, he plays a boring game since it is more efficient if he stays put, rarely engaging in other game choices. 

I see people's comments about Ghost Stories, but I think this game is easier--easier to learn & easier to win.

I have added it to my wishlist.

I had played 1 two player game of this before writing about it. I found you had to make sure to keep some army going to fight off the enemies. It can be a challenge to beat and from what I've read elsewhere, it can snowball into certain defeat if you don't stay on top of it. It's pretty fun though watching chunks of the land plummet into the ocean. I need to play this a few more times to be certain. In July of 2015 I took a look at the availability of this game and it was about ZERO! The ones that were for sale were on Amazon with silly prices. One in particular was $180 and I thought I saw another for much higher. It's not worth that price though I can tell you. There's much better games for less money. Some people will try to sell a rat's a-hole to a blind man for a wedding ring if they can get away with it.

How could anyone not like this game? It's a thrilling co-op that keeps us on the edges of our seat till the very end. This game is suggested almost every week.

Update 7/2014: This game is still a strong choice. We've done ~30 playthroughs in our gaming group and still enjoy it.

Update 2/2016: We had to retire this game after 40+ playthroughs. Proud to say it has found a new home where it can be appreciated. Still 10/10, best value I've ever gotten out of a board game.

I'm coming to the conclusion that co-op games are not really for me, so this rating is perhaps lower than it should be.  The idea of a co-op worker placement game is interesting in theory, as well as the idea that the best parts of the island might be flooded before you can use them.  However, after a while everything gets very repetitive as you try to get what resources you can (and more often than not failing due to poor dice rolls) and half your workers are permanently committed to defending the island from attack.  For the last half of the game, there wasn't really any game to play since one person was basically dictating where to go (although it was pretty obvious where everyone needed to go anyway).  Resources seem way too difficult to get - we played on the easy deck and basically won at the last possible moment due to a fortuitous ability card that gave us some free resources.  I have no idea how you would be able to win this game on the higher difficulty levels.  I don't think I would play this again, but again, that might be more because I have not had great experiences with co-op games.

There are some really great ideas present in this game. As each turn passes it truly imbues a sense of urgency as the waves come slowly creeping towards you. However, the ever growing presence of the attacking navy negates the purpose of increasing your population size, and you rarely try to complete die rolls on rare resources because transmutation is a much safer alternative. 
For such a clever concept and fun theme some of the mechanics feel very under-developed. It can still be fun with casual gamers in small doses. (^_^)

After one play, I think this is a fun co-op game. It's kind of a step up from Pandemic mechanically. The gameplay is great, but probably susceptible to alpha gamer syndrome. It has a puzzle-y worker placement style. The only semi-disappointing things was the art. The cover is gorgeous and I expected something similar from the game components, but it was really pretty drab. I can look past that, though. I would definitely play this one again.

More of a solo game than a coop, because the ideal strategy is to have one or two players send ALL of their workers to defend each round.  Which means those players do absolutely nothing and are just watching everyone else play the game.

Atlantis Rising is a fully co-operative game in which the players must race to create a cosmic gate before all of the island tiles have been destroyed. The gate's components are variable and determine the difficulty level of the game - Easy, Normal, Hard, or Cosmic. The players must also contend with the continually escalating threat of their Athenian enemies, who may destroy one or more island tiles each turn if insufficient Atlanteans are allocated to the island's protection.

Game is a coop version of Survive. Hard to beat, but quick to play. Different enough from Pandemic, Ghost or Forbidden Desert to own.

I like this little co-op alot. The 'tone' is tense and anxious, but not hair-pullingly so. Luck of the draw (or toss) can play a strong role in whether you win or lose, but the games are still usually close either way. (We don't often win OR lose by a very large margin.) The theme is also very colorful and well-developed.  The 'navy' mechanic is perhaps a bit dry, but I'm confident the first expansion will remedy that... ^_~

Very interesting Worker Placement co-op board game and I don't know any more of this kind.
At first I was really annoyed by one mechanic in game called "Navy Board". It's board where you have to place your workers in order to protect atlantis from attackers. What it basically means is you are giving up your workers (means action) in order to prevent (or try) the negative effects (sinking island). It's frustrating, because with each turn the navy gets harder and you have to give up even more workers (individually or as group) and when you can have max only 6 workers and almost HAVE to place 3-4 of them nearing the end of game, you feel very limited in your choice. It's even more frustrating, because it's almost forcing one player to give up all his workers just for this, because it's more efficient that way or use dummy player. 
That how things were until I found variant in BGG called: Atlantis Rising Navy Cards Variant. Anyone who owns or thinking of owning this game I highly recommend using this variant - it's amazing and solves all the problems I just have mentioned! Use it as soon as you can, especially if you are playing with 2-3 players.

RATING: 8
An intense co-op game that makes you sense disaster right from the first round, as you watch your precious island sink into the sea.  The game combines worker-placement and resource management with a push-your-luck element.  Players never feel like they have enough workers to accomplish everything they need to do.  This is because aside from having to send them out to get the resources to build a mystical machine to save the island, you also need to use your workers to ward off an ever growing threat from invading Athenians.

Players choose a character, each with their own special ability.  My only real complaint about the game arises from this.  The special powers are very specific to enable players to perform certain actions more efficiently than others.  The result of this is that there's a tendency for players to become pigeonholed into performing the same action(s) every turn all game long.  To do otherwise is to the detriment of the whole team.

Nevertheless, this is still a fun nail biter!

Relatively new to us.  After the first game, we thought it might not work, as one of us would always have to be manning the defenses against the Athenian navy while the other played the game (obviously this is in 2-player mode), which would make it boring for the shipmaster.  However, before our second game we discovered the BGG variant for the Atlantean Navy, and the second game was a lot more fun.  Note: Traded in Math Trade for Shadows of Brimstone: Swamps of Death

1) easily dominated by one player

As Atlantis is sinking, you and a team of scientist are trying to create an engine that will raise Atlantis into the skies and into safety. Each turn you place your workers on a location in anticipation of being able to perform an action. If you place your worker next to the shore line they have a greater reward, but there is a greater chance they will be swept away by the sinking island. I need to play Atlantis Rising again before I cast my final judgment on it. My first play was less then memorable. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Great components, interesting theme, and... absolutely punishing gameplay.

I think Atlantis Rising would be a good co-op game if the number of machine parts players need to complete to win the game scaled with the number of players. Even playing the easiest mode, Atlantis Rising is not possible to beat with 2 players. With the island being composed of 37 pieces, if no one commits to defend against the attacking Athenians a minimum of 2 to a maximum 9 pieces can sink in a single turn depending on Misfortune deck draws and attack dice rolls. The game just ends too fast for players to complete the machine.

There is something so unsatisfying about failing to successfully roll a die roll for resources. The game does give a way to improve the outcome of your rolls in the form of single-use tokens, but they have to be 'mined' every turn and a player's workers are almost always better spent elsewhere.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Painfully hard to win! This island is going down no matter what you do...it starts with the very first turn. To make matters worse you have to build how many components for the Cosmic Gate to win...ten? And the Athenian Army is attacking too? There is a strategy here and I am determined to find it...but the island is still going down, maybe I can save a small bit of beach for myself when it's all over. I'm screwed no matter what because I can never roll sixes...that leaves me out of any gate parts requiring crystal cubes.

The strategy must be in the powerful cards you can obtain and in the number of workers you acquire as fast as you can. There is an intensity to this game that goes beyond the usual cooperative style games...it's not exactly fun to play because it is frustratingly hard to win...but it is a good game!

Warning: this game is not for the faint of heart, provides players with extreme stress!

What I like:
- Pure co-op with great theme and hooray for worker placement mechanics
- Beautiful modular board, with lots of nice bits
- Turns move quickly; 2p learning game took 35 minutes

What I don't like:
- If the only way to win is to immediately collect all your extra workers, why not just start with them?
- In a 2p game, one player staffs the navy every round and does NOTHING else. Literally. Boring! This can be solved by adding a 3rd "robot" player that just staffs the navy every single turn.
- There is probably just one strategy you must follow, although there are some tactical choices along the way

First game was a crushing loss (3 parts completed). Second was better (8 parts completed), and 3rd was kind of close (9 parts completed). But following a formulaic strategy wasn't much fun. Fourth play was a win, tweaking the formula a bit. Fifth play, with 2 players plus a dummy 3rd, was a narrow loss.

I would put the weight a bit lower than the BGG-voted 2.8. I'll go with 2.6.

Highly underrated game!  Very hard to find now and that is a shame.  AR mixes 2 of my favorite genre of games - worker placement and cooperative.  As Atlanteans, you are trying to build the components to complete a space portal which will allow you to escape Atlantis' ultimate demise.  Each turn yo place workers around the isle of Atlantis, to receive benefits to aid you.   But watch out as the island sinks fast so there is not much time to accomplish all you hope to do.  This game is hard...but when you win, it is such a GREAT feeling!

I play other co-op games (I own Ghost Stories and Forbidden Island, and I played often Pandemic with friends..I also played a lot Shadow Over Camelot) and I do like them (I have seen many of the low rating are coming from people who do not like co-op...this is not the case)

I couldn't find this game challenging at all. We won 9 times out of 10 (one VERY unlucky sequence of rolls and cards), playing at hard difficulty level except the first 2 times (3 to 5 players).
The strategy seems very limited to (1) use cities at the beginning to get all possible peoples and (2) have 1 or 2 players (depends on the total number of people playing) almost do not anything other than putting all their people on the Athenians tile against the ship while the others get resources and build. These players will have a very boring game. We didn't find variety in playing the game, not even changing roles. 

The worse among the co-op games I played till now.
I am a little amazed by the high number of people saying the game is very difficult, almost frustrating. We didn't experience this at all. I think the game is slightly more difficult in 4 people, but this may be just related to our direct experience.

Very very hard co-op game, rarely do you get to "win".  But it's always a good time.  I was extremely impressed with this game, it's simple, easy to teach, and tons of fun.  Recommended players is 3 or 6.  2/4/5 is just added punishment.

RATING: 5
3 Aborted games and 2 complete games - 1 win.  If you are a masochist, this is your game.  It is the Kobayashi Maru of board games - a study in how well you accept defeat.  Luck in rolling and drawing cards completely outweighs any decision the players make.  Just because a game is difficult to win does not make it a great game.  I am not against dice rolling in games, but the implementation is this game is particularly annoying.  Stone Age has a much better dice driven resource collection mechanism.  Some player powers force them to play the same tired actions over and over and over again.  And can someone explain to me why the high tech Atlanteans can't fight off the ridiculously aggressive Athenians whose technology consists of biremes, spears, and shields?  Sorry people, this is not a good game in it's current incarnation

This seems like a very good with thing that I think *might* be a bit of a defect and that would be the navy. On the one hand I appreciate the tension it brings, but on the other hand it seems like mostly somebody just gets stuck babysitting it. I would like to see a fixed navy version or some kind of replacement for it. Otherwise I really like the theme and the co-op + worker placement smash up.

I'm surprised this coop isn't even in the Top 1000. Where is the love!? I would highly recommend this game to any coop lover that is a bit tired of how samey things like Pandemic/Flash Point feel. In this game, you're trying to gather resources and build technologies in order to get off of Atlantis. However, you must gather the resources from different parts of Atlantis (the board) before it sinks. It has a worker placement/press your luck thing going on. The only thing I don't like about it is that the die rolls can really screw you over. However, I have that issue with almost every game that involves dice, which is why I tend to gravitate towards Euros.

An excellent worker placement, co-op game with an element of tension due to a sinking island "mechanic". I don't know of any other game like this but maybe one is out there. It has enough replayability with multiple characters and components to build. Seems complicated at first but after a few games the gameplay is fast and becomes second nature. Very challenging game (fun even if you lose) but highly recommended...although it's very hard to find a copy.

[b]--- Game Summary ---[/b]
This is a coop game with worker-placement, die-rolls for resource-production, and unique player powers. 

The board is shaped like a 6-pointed asterisk (*) with each limb being made of several individual pieces, each of which is a location for 1+ workers that will allow you to either recruit an additional worker (up to a limit/player based on player count), produce resource cubes (yellow, white, or black), convert black cubes to gray, or draw 1+ action cards (which have a variety of rule- or game-modifying uses). The pieces furthest out have the best worker:cube conversion ratio, but are also at greatest risk of being flooded each turn. The center location gives each worker placed their a power stone (which can be used in various numbers to modify dice rolls, cancel bad events, etc.). 

There's also a separate board -- another worker placement location, too -- to track the Athenians strength modifier, which increases each turn up to a max of 12 (at the end of every round they attack with a strength = die roll + strength modifier).

Finally, there's a display of 10 cards showing ship components (cost cubes to build, and usually give you an additional power) that must all be built in order to win the game. Players start the game with unique characters, each of which give you a bonus in one area (e.g., easier to collect resources or draw cards; more effective at fighting the Athenians or building the machines). 

On your turn, place all your workers. After everyone's done, draw 1 Misfortune card per player: usually, it'll tell you to flood one terrain (limb of the star): flip the piece furthest from the center face down, returning any workers there to the player. There are a FEW "no event" cards, as well as other special-text cards. Next, collect resources: usually need to roll higher than whatever number is indicated on the space where you're standing -- sort of like Stone Age (except you usually have too few workers with too-high target numbers!). Then, roll the Athenian's dice (a d6 something like 2 3 3 3 4 5?), add the modifier on the track, and subtract the number of workers placed there to fight them; if the sum is positive, you'll be flooding more pieces! Finally, each player may build a component of the escape ship (one of those 10 cards) if they have the appropriate ingredients.

[b]--- Comments ---[/b]
For a coop game, it's pretty good. It's still a coop game, of course, so it won't change your mind if you're not already into those. The worker-placement part is an interesting addition, though, since you now have the option of doing several different things on your turn. Of course, given that each player is better at one thing, it seems as if they really ought to do [i]just[/i] that thing (at least after the early turns, when people should also likely try to get additional workers) -- which sounds like it could be kind of a boring game. 

When I first played [thing=65532]Defenders of the Realm[/thing], it seemed pretty much like it was just [thing=30549]Pandemic[/thing] with dice. This game is sort of [thing=30549]Pandemic[/thing] + [thing=34635]Stone Age[/thing], but it's a bigger departure: bad stuff is happening to you from the very first turn, [i]every[/i] turn, and in a way that is almost totally unpredictable (flip of the card). Fortunately the power stones do let you mitigate the luck a bit. And the die-rolling is like Stone Age, but it's harder to play the odds by piling workers in one location since many locations only allow 1 or 2 workers. 

I'd certainly play it again, but I won't be seeking to play or acquire this (or any) coop game repeatedly!

RATING: 5
I expected more from this game.  It's a cooperative worker placement affair and I enjoy both worker placement and good cooperative games.  This simply isn't a very good cooperative game.

The game is played by placing workers on spaces to collect resources needed to build different artifacts.  Once 10 artifacts have been built the players win the game but every turn a "misfortune" card is turned over which usually  causes one of the worker placement spaces to flood (denying you the action your worker would have taken there).  Also at the end of every turn you will lose more spaces to flooding based on how many workers you committed to not taking action but instead fighting an invading army.

The actions that your workers can take in this game are incredibly uninteresting.  The majority of the game is simply rolling dice and collecting a resource based on the luck of the roll.  When that's 90% of your game it is going to get boring quick.  None of the decisions felt very interesting.  When you did have the option of selecting which spaces to flood the choice was usually pretty obvious.  There are few design choices I dislike more than when a game is on autopilot but still tries to disguise itself as giving you a choice.

Just a very mediocre attempt at a cooperative game.  There was some variety in variable player powers and special action cards as well as building the artifacts provided one time effects.  But they were just extensions or variations on the rest of the boring actions you can take in the game.

Preliminary rating.  Enjoyable so far.

Update: Knocking rating down by a point.  I wish the Athenians presented more interesting choices.  Worse, though, there seems to be one strategy that is significantly better than all others, to the point that it is the only correct one.  Lots of cool ideas here, but not the best execution.

This was a good co-op that didn't feel as formulaic or puzzley as other co-ops and not too random.

The worker placement as a co-op worked well. Like other co-ops with roles it felt like one or two roles are must haves play to win.

First of all, the theme doesn't make a lick of senses to me.
This is a coop where you fight constantly against the game.  And I don't mean that in a good way ; there's always something bad happening with little rewards.  Add to that dice rolling and you've got a exercise in frustration.
A coop should make you feel like you could have made it with the right decisions and make you want to try again when you miss.  This game as neither and all you end up blaming are dice roll (and bad design...)

Initial reaction: Disappointed. Mostly just test-your-luck, but the choices are very bland. Do I want a 5+ or a slightly riskier 4+? Does it matter? Not really worker placement; no tension in what order to place. Not really any short/long term tradeoffs. Athenian fleet is just a sink of workers each turn. On the upside, it is fast moving and plays well as an "over dinner" game as it doesn't require hands of cards.

I LOVE the premise of this game. You play the role of Atlanteans trying to escape during the sinking of Atlantis.  The Athenians, Atlantis is sinking, and you feel doomed from the very beginning. 

The gameplay focuses around worker placement.  You guide your group of Atlanteans into the different sections of the Island, collecting resources needed to build a Cosmic Gate, the only way to get everyone off the Island in time.  The island sinks incredibly fast, and the most advantageous parts of the island sink first.  The Athenians come by and sink more parts of the Island. Every decision feels vitally important, which is just awesome!

So why the low-ish rating?  Replay value and component quality.  After 4-5 plays I feel confident that I know how to win consistently, which takes the atmosphere out of the game. In addition, while the Island itself is a ton of fun to watch sink over the course of the game, the rest of the components feel cheap. 

I would play this game with new players for the experience of watching them play the game, but I would pass over it when looking for a challenge with a group already experienced with the game.

RATING: 3
I had high hopes for this game after reading and watching several positive reviews.  I enjoy worker placement and co-op games, and saw the appeal in something a little lighter than Robinson Crusoe.

Sadly, the game did not live up to expectations.  The actions on the board are as vanilla as worker placement gets:  get resources, convert resources, get more workers.  What looks like a plethora of options as you build the board turns out to be the same action repeated with a slightly better or worse return on investment.

Still, this could be made more enjoyable with some cool special player powers or upgrades earned as you play.  The player powers are just OK, sadly, and the upgrades from the tech cards are almost inconsequential.

Then there is, by far, the worst part of the game:  the Athenian navy.  Every turn, the navy will attack with a gradually escalating strength + the result of a die roll. Did you send enough workers to equal the die roll?  If not, then more of the island sinks.  There's no way to mitigate this, no way to become more efficient at fighting, just a tax on your available actions each round.  So you spend the first few turns grabbing some key resources, and your extra workers, and the navy pretty much keeps pace with your progress.  You're spending rounds getting workers while the game simply increases the amount that need to be committed to the military.  This may be one of the least fun mechanisms I've ever come across in a co-op game.

Among the co-ops I've played, this is one of the better games. The core engine is card driven, but there are some Euro elements built in such as worker placement, resource management and worker expansion. The use of resources to buy technologies which both provide boons and feed victory conditions sets this apart from other co-ops. This is the favorite family game at this time.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
[thing=92120][/thing] is pretty and efficient in creating decisions and setting the mood of pressure and despair, as the island is sinking, with your options literally going under, while the attacks from the Athenians keep getting stronger. And this happens from the very start of the game: in the first round there is already the danger of losing actions, depending on the placement of workers. It is interesting and proper with the theme, a race against time, a point that gets more and more underlined as the play goes on.

[thing=92120][/thing] also offers relevant decisions, be in the allocation phase, where not only is important to take into consideration what you want, but also the risk of that action to not be made; decisions occur in the Misfortune phase, as there are cards that give the choice of which tiles to flood for the players; and, finally, the decision regarding what components to build: is a fact that, sometimes, the choice will be made by what resources one has, still, is possible to hold on, or having enough to build more than one option, therefore players must take into consideration the bonus they will receive and the effect of it in the current state of play.

These are the positives. The negative is the high luck factor in several aspects of the mechanics: the events are random, the gathering of resources and the Athenians attack come from dice rolls. The game give ways to lessen the impact of luck, such as mystical barriers, mystic energy, courage tokens and Knowledge cards. Yet, I think it would serve the game well to have automatic resource gathering (something that would deeply change other aspects in the game), even if meant using more than one worker (such as the way it happens in [thing=121921][/thing]). In the way it is, some turns can simply be wasted, which can lead to frustration, and games that can constantly frustrate, usually doesn't last in the good grace of players. And is far from good when, at the end of the play, one can say "we lost because we rolled badly".

[thing=92120][/thing] works well for solo play, with the person controlling multiple characters, an easy thing to do, and while doing this, wasted turns with one character will bother much less.

Overall, [thing=92120][/thing] is a challenging coop, even in the easiest level, with a high replay value coming from the unique characters that can be in play, passing by the randomness of the events, and going into the components, as these are draw at the start and can a piece or another can change between plays - and is possible to increase the difficulty by changing the parts used (in the basic game you use parts from A, B and C; using A, B and D would make the play more challenging, for instance). It is also thematic, and immediately creates a link between mechanics and the theme by showing the island steadily going under the sea.

In the end, I recommend [thing=92120][/thing], but with restrictions.

Unimpressed by a first play but changed my mind after a couple more.  The main reason for this, I believe, was having a dummy player (ideally the Priest) assigned the full-time duty of fending off the Athenians - with time off only to have some babies. The alternative is inefficient play, or otherwise a human players to take one for the team by having a rather dull game.

RATING: N/A
Pure co-op, where you have to build 10 components from resources like Ore, Gold, Crystal before the island sinks around you. Each island piece allows a specific skill like gathering resources, drawing cards etc, at varying conversion rates, with the best rates disappearing first. Tough decisions follow on which pieces to allow to disappear in order to save other sections that are crucial to your plans, and so forth.

I'm a co-op fan, so I really liked this a lot. If I had a criticism, it would be that the game play has a very negative feel to it. Bad stuff is constantly happening to you, with only a rare event card saying "nothing happens". You draw one event card per player per turn, so the end of each turn is things like "remove tile X, remove tile Y, everybody loses a meeple, remove tile Z". Next round, same thing.

Contrast with something like Pandemic, where many turns go by without anything bad happening. You draw new cards to help you cure, a new cube appears in a benign spot, etc. Pandemic manages to ratchet up the tension, then drop the hammer on you 5 turns later, where here it happens to you constantly.

If you don't like the feeling of dread, don't play this game.

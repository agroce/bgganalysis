Maybe we are doing something wrong here. We got this game because Launius's name was on it. he is one of our favorite designers so we just had to try it. But after a single round of play, round mind you not game, we were bored. In one round you play cards at locations, next round you do ranged attack by drawing cards from a deck (War style) to see who wins and who loses. Then you go through a round of melee combat. You fight at 3 different locations possibly using 8-16 dragons and about 10-14 cards per player. But it just felt like "I play this card. Oh you countered it. Ok Your turn. You play that card. Oh I countered it." before we had even scored one location we were out of cards. And when that happens subsequent combat is resolved by drawing cards off the deck and comparing them just like War. Like we said perhaps we are just playing this all wrong.

If you play just one round you will miss quite a bit which makes this game good.  Some dragon help you out later or give next round benefit.  

The first phase uses ranged attacks not real effective but you can get lucky.  The first phase also is about setting up some combo benefits.

The second part of the game is akin to the kids game war with combos thrown in and a little bluffing or deduction added.

3rd not full game but I'm beginning to see the game past the rule book and I'm glad to fing there is something there.

Cool, detailed dragon art on top of a back and forth hand management game. The hand management outstays its welcome and it is a bit too back and forth. Random dice combat seems to be replaced with random card draw.

RATING: 7.5
This is a fairly enjoyable game with a nice mix of strategy and luck. I've generally found it to go 40-50 minutes - there can be a degree of AP in it. This review reviews to the 2016 reprint.

Knitpicks:
* The cards felt a bit waxy at first, but were fine after a couple of plays
* Some of the dragon abilities were a bit vague - referring to the index of cards on this site was very useful (we had assumed some meanings that turned out to be wrong)
* Not sure how I feel about the magic attacks - felt like it swung battles overly much
* Had 5 marred cards in my box - but Robert replaced them really quickly
* The rulebook was a little tough to follow - the Watch It Played video was really helpful - https://youtu.be/g91MkL-oEjw

The good:
* Great art 
* Fairly balanced
* Good variety - nicely replayable
* Robert replaced a few misprints in my deck very quickly
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The art I this game is fantastic.  Beyond that, I kind of feel like this game isn't sure what it wants to be.  There are several strategic elements to placing your dragons, but all of that strategy seems to be for nothing with the card drawing combat system.  I found myself trying to come up with the best strategy for playing my dragons to have that thought ultimately be wasted with bad card draws.

Great mechanics divided into the game's three sections (dragon placement, and ranged and melee attacks).  Beautiful art and theme.  The playtime runs longer for me than the printed 30 minutes, but a very enjoyable game, with a -- can't stress this enough -- well written and easy to follow rule book.  A really awesome card game.

Another duel game where you lay cards next to several battlefields and win by conquering three lands of the same or different color. There is nothing too wrong with it, but the combat system feels underdeveloped, as battles often end in a tie or with just one of the five or six fighting dragons killed. You can play some big combos, but they are usually too risky, as the opponent can avoid all damage with a single "flight" card, so that you most often end up playing one card at a time. The game would be fine if it lasted the 30 minutes advertised on the box, but that is a joke and it takes too long for how much luck of the draw it has.

The artwork from Kerem Beyit is the best thing in the game, despite a lot of it having been previously used in "Mount Drago". The graphic design, however, is ridiculous: huge icons where they are not needed (used when you just reveal cards from the deck), but tiny font and tiny icons too similar to each other that must be checked when the cards are in your hand or on the other side of the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Only test-played it solo yet. Seems good -- after you get to know the dragon special ability; before it's a lot of reading, and probably missing minor rules.

- there *is* strategy (I think some people complained it's too random)
- decisions are: where and when to play dragons;
- the melee phase is especially fun:
- some bluffing around combos: play less or more; keep cards for defending; go "all-in" or try to win with only one dragon more etc.
- sacrifice one gem only to retreat a strong dragon to a more important gem (color-wise)
- even the order of the battlefield resolution counts

Production quality issues: some card backs are slightly off in hue or brightness. Okay for casual play; but not tournament-ready.

The box size is perfect! :)

Kickstarted, received 10/10/2014.

Cards are absolutely gorgeous. Probably the prettiest cards I've seen. Extremely heavy stock, beautiful artwork. Game was fun before we even know how to play it simply because it was fun to look at the cards. 

Rule book is a little lacking in clarity (although I was trying to read it at like 1 AM so that might have something to do with it). Actually, it might be more fair to say that the rule book is TOO precise. It's difficult to come away with a general notion of how to play. I'd recommend watching the "how to play" video on the Kickstarter page. 

Gameplay is pretty easy to pick up in the end. There's enough of a surprise factor in the random draw to keep things exciting. However, I'd say this game emphasizes strategy over luck, which is nice in a non TCG/LCG game.

Overall, pretty good game after 1 play :) We'll update as we play more.

Update: 10/18/2014-> We did our second play through today. I'm worried the game doesn't have as high a replay value as I'd hoped in terms of strategy. But I did have pretty poor luck with draws, so I might just be indignant ^.^

We also found the win-conditions a little lacking. We house ruled to limit the win conditions to 3 of a kind or 4 total. We eliminated the 3-unique win condition (seemed too easy). I think we might even bump the 4 total to 5 total or 3 of a kind. Mechanics over all are decently balanced, I just feel like the of the 3 win conditions, one is most often more appealing.

[b]Review:[/b]

I'm in love with the theme, I'm in love with the card mechanics, and I'm love with the level of strategy present in this relatively quick and deceptively light card game. 

Unlike most games that rely on dice to introduce luck, I feel flipping cards to decide who wins a ranged attack is much more enjoyable. As if I fail once, the predetermined amount of hits and misses in a deck means I have a good chance of being more successful the next time. 

In melee, bluffing your opponent and trying to whittle away their stronger combos while keeping your own defense strong, is very exciting. And timing when to play a magic combo is immensely entertaining. 

I've had 1 game in 4 where ties were rampant, which lead to a game lasting 1hr and 20 minutes. But I haven't felt like that is the norm, and with a better understanding of how to play combos efficiently, it's happening less and less. 

I can't recommend this game highly enough as a satisfying strategic card game with tons of replay-ability. And for a strategic board gamer like myself, the luck actually makes the game more fun, rather than a frustration. 

Can`t wait for future expansions!!!

[b]Pros:[/b]

- Considering all the dragons have the same pose, they are all a pleasure to look at, especially with the metallic cards expansion. 
- The luck in the game is thoughtfully enjoyable and never feels like you're on a loosing streak. 
- Mitigating the ranged attacks with battlefield effects and dragon abilities is very strategic.
- Timing the use of melee cards, turns into a fantastic mini bluffing game. Flight and magic cards always keep you on your toes. 
- Adding advanced battle cards to your deck, does create a sense of escalation in the game.

[b]Cons:[/b]

- Some games can go a little long if ties occur and the Polar Dragon's ability is used. 
- The Clockwork dragon is next to useless considering it's a special dragon class. 
- The Battle dragon seems a little too powerful at times, but not impossible to defeat.

Felt like two separate games. There's the game of placing your dragons and trying to get ranged hits (which is basically a random crap shoot) and then the game of using your hand of cards to fight the other dragons, which is less of a random crap shoot and more of a slow burn until someone runs out of cards or stops caring. I generally stopped caring.

And then we had to play another full round starting with the first phase of the game again...

[Kickstarter] A dragon card game with a pretty convoluted way of capturing objectives. This plays like Blue Moon (i.e. play cards to try to win an objective), but is more random and the melee battles at the end don't seem to have much tactical or strategic application. Perhaps some choice in picking what Advanced Battle cards you want or control over the battle (e.g. playing 1 card at a time) would make it better.

Other than that, the art looks fabulous and the playmat is great.

My 13-year-old daughter loves this game. The card play has just the right amount of strategy for us, and she loves the theme. For my part, it drags on a little bit more than the promised 30 minutes, but that's mainly due to too much A.P. on our part.

Absolutely LOVE the artwork for this game. For me, the theme and artwork is fantastic. The gameplay however seemed boring. Each player plays with the same dragon and battle cards (save a few advanced battle cards that you can add to your specific deck). The dragon stats were just too similar. Pixel Tactics uses same decks for each player and yet they can all be played so differently. Draco Magi felt very luck driven and I was just bored. I couldn't get excited about anything other than the beautiful artwork. I also did not like the immodest female on the cover.

I find it hard to rate this game. A card game with special powers and combos and tactical card play is right up my street, but it is hard to like a game that apparently hates me. I have the current record of 0-13. Some of that was bad play, but there is quite a bit of luck involved, with ranged attack card draws and the mix of cards you get in your hand for battles, even the dragons you get for a set of battlegrounds. Typical of my luck is losing dragons to a ranged 1 attack (draw 2 hots, I save 1) or a ranged 4 attack where I do 1 hit. Or drawing 1 or more flights in the dungeon battles where flights can't be played (3 times that has happened). I want to like it more but it frustrates me. My wife loves it though, she has a perfect record.

Well, that didn't pan out, did it? Per KS Project Update #48 on October 11, 2014 "Coolstuff has been packing games and they have begun shipping out this week!". This one isn't an EU Friendly project, so it'll be interesting to see whether it gets caught up in UK Customs and how much they screw me over for if it does.

KS update #57 said that all deliveries (by which it meant of course "all US deliveries" - the ones we care about) should be complete as of Nov 17, 2014. Checking via comments said EU should add a couple of weeks to that date. Also, due to yet another fuck up, the promo materials will be shipped separately. Watch out for badly colour-matched card backs!

Commenting on Draco Magi is hard because it is essentially 3 interconnected games in 1.  The placing of Dragons and using ranged attacks on its own is the weakest part of the game, however using those placements as a set up for the melee phase both in actuality or as bluffs put intrigue in the early game once players start to look ahead.  The Melee game itself is wonderfully designed as players not only weigh or time combos but are constantly contending with the advantage of an early or massive strike versus the dangers of over extending.  This game can be solved, however, leading to unbreakable battle loops, but thankfully that is  handled by the 3rd, and best part of the game: bluffing.  This is what will keep the game alive for me for many more plays.  Choosing battlefields, placing dragons, playing or not playing combos along with choosing which cards to play all go into a wonderful mind game between the 2 players as they try to lure each other to commit forces to incorrect battles and burn battle cards in useless attacks.  Were it not for this part, the game would essentially fall flat, but this game of 'battle poker' is pretty fun most of the time.

However, the game best strength also makes it a fragile experience that can be shattered by opponents with gulfs in skill level.  Like most duels, they are only fun when played on equal footing, and in the case of Draco Magi it is critical.

[update] turns out the particular card that creates the cyclical battles was changed during play testing to match a misinterpretation that testers were using and found more "fun"... but going back to the original wording fixes the issue we had with endless battles.  But this becomes a deal breaker because the need to bridge the gulf in player experience for good games is now complicated by the need to have experienced players willing to "houserule" back to the original rules for me to get to play the game that i enjoy... bummer

Art and theme looked so cool plus cool designers so I had to pre order. I'm still not sure how much of it is a deck building game, how many expansions there will be (collectible, living, more similar to which?) and I'm not sure what it will be like. If it's a deck building game and better than Nightfall than I may retire nightfall. I'm just not sure.

I hope it's really good and I hope the theme feels thematic or assymetrical if that's what's necessary for theme. I like the idea of a really cool easy to understand 2 player card game and I like the idea of a dragon game. I'm all ready to sleeve this one up and play when it comes. Being such a completionist though, it will be annoying if it has a TON of expansions like Nightfall because my OCD will kick in and I'll have to buy all of them which may not be worthwhile depending on how much I play.

UPDATE: 

I really like the two phase layers of this game. Yes it's more abstracted than I would like but it plays quick and smooth and makes for a nice portable all-inclusive (not a collectible) card game that you can actually teach easily in one sitting. The art is beautiful, it's really well polished with a lot of things being thought of ahead of time that other producers would have overlooked. The mechanics are elegant and pleasing. Even though the individual feel/flavor of each dragon perhaps doesn't come out mechanically as much as one would hope, this is made up for in a really tight fun card game with beautiful dragon art and interesting card combat.

A Cool, Fun, Classy, Quality 2 Player Card Game of Dragons Combating and Competing over Gems by Two Excellent Designers. 

The game plays in rounds, with each round having two main stages: dragons are placed on sides of 3 different battlefields sometimes using ranged attacks, then the dragons perform melee combats at each battlefield. 

A very tactical game, with lots of luck in the card draws. Games can play quick after the initial learning hurdles.

Of Kosmos caliber. Artwork is better than Larry Elmore's.

Draco Magi is a well balanced two player game that I win often when playing my brother.  Robert Burke has made some great games but I believe this is the best.  The art in it is second to none.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
26-01-2015. Rated after several plays. Draco Magi is a game about 'dragon combat'. Basically, it reminds me a little of blood bowl team manager and Defenders of the Realm Battlefields. You 'fight' over areas that contain a gem. You need to have 4 different gems, 3 the same gems or 3 different gems to win. 

Each round you get a hand of 8 dragons and you play them across 3 battlefields. Each dragon has a special ability and some dragons have ranged abilities. Ranged abilities allow you to 'attack' the opposing dragon and see if you can kill them. After all dragons have been placed, play continues to a 'melee' round of combat. Ranged and Melee damage is resolved not with dice, but with a combat deck. Each card contains symbols that show how many damage you would do when attacking ranged, and how much damage you can block during ranged defending. These cards also have melee combat names (claw, bite etc). If your opponent during melee plays a bite, the defender has to play a bite card or lose a dragon. Interesting is that you can play combos, by playing several melee cards that show the same 'combo' icon.

To make the setup different, there are 'advanced' combat cards you can draft. It's a fun, two player area control game. I liked it.

RATING: 10
This game is absolutely amazing!  Well balanced and lots of strategy involved.  Our games have been REALLY close at the end.  Every battle was intense!

Pros:
- Lots of strategy in placing your dragons and using your attack cards.
- Stunning artwork, good quality
- Lots of depth!  The more I learn about the game, the more complex I realize it is.

Cons:
- The rule book could use more clarification. I had to go to the forums here on BGG to get some clarifications.  The creator of the game was pretty good about answering a lot of the questions on BGG though.
- The ranged attack mechanic really doesn't do much and is pretty much random.  It is really hard to successfully do any damage via ranged attacks, even when attacking at a location that buffs those attacks.

Pro/Con (depending on how you look at it)
- A game can sometimes be short depending on what locations come out and what players choose to do.  If all the locations on the first round are all the same gem or all different gems and if one player wins them all, the game is over.  Granted, this is only a problem if you have a stronger player or if the players do not use the dragons to their full advantage.

Two players duel with dragons. In some respects elegant and interesting, in others a bit tedious and clunky.

RATING: 6
This is a really light, quick, two-player card game with a decent amount of depth and decisions in it.  It also balances really well known information strategy with a decent amount of luck at all the right times.

In this game each player has a deck of dragons and a deck of actions.  Players take turns playing dragons to battlefields.  They sometimes attack immediately and often have other abilities that play around with the rules some.  Then at the end of the round each player battles their dragons against each other to win the battlefield.  Getting a certain number of battlefields wins the game and the whole thing finishes in 30 minutes or less.

The mechanics are really cleverly balanced.  Each player has the same deck of dragons and basic actions so there is some known information, especially with the dragons.  You know how many dragons the opponent has and sometimes there is a "perfect" dragon for a particular situation so you can work out the chances of that dragon being played against you.  However, while the action deck for each player is the same, advanced action cards are added to this and it is cycled through and reshuffled into itself frequently throughout the game.  The mechanics of the action deck are reasonably simple too.  Play matching cards to fend off attacks until you can get one or more through.

For the speed of play and simplicity despite being extremely clever this is a great candidate for filler two-player game.  It's not something I'm going to want to play all the time because at times it can feel like it plays itself but I still enjoy it in the right doses.

The artwork on the cards deserves special mention.  Each dragon is gorgeous and has it's own look and personality jumping right off the card.  However, the cards are some of the shittiest quality I've ever seen.  Especially considering the amount of shuffling required I suggest everyone sleeve this game lest your cards disintegrate in your hand after about the 5th play.  This is disappointing since you have to toss the insert and kind of inefficiently store the cards in the box with sleeves on them.  And if you got the foil cards for the metallic dragons, those are even thinner!

This was a Kickstarter pickup that was delivered Octoberm 2014, although I was able to play the game at Gencon 2014 with one of the designers.  My wife and I like that it is a fun 2-player game, involving DRAGONS!  First off, the art is beautiful!  This is a very good looking game, one of the best looking games I own, art-wise.  Game play is very good, but I want to get a lot more plays in though.  Both decks are standard with a bit of drafting for the two "advanced battle deck" cards you get at the begining of the game.  As of right now, my rating may be a little inflated due to how good these cards look.

My copy has all of the quality issues that everybody on the forum is talking about: card that are different sizes, different shades on card backs, wrong amount of cards, chipping. This seems to have affected the entire print run so there's no alternative at this point. Disappointing.

The game itself, at least initially, is also disappointing in some ways. The game also suffers from coming out at the same time as Warhammer Conquest, which has very similar gameplay but is a far superior game.

So far my main problem with Draco Magi is that battles very frequently end in a draw, so that battle just stays the same until the next round where it may possibly end up being a draw yet again. I prefer Warhammer Conquest's battles where you keep fighting until only one side remains. In Draco Magi, you also can't really plan for the battles very well. You just have to play your cards and hope your opponent doesn't have the right cards to counter your attack. Considering you both have the same decks of cards, this just comes down to the luck of the draw.

So far this game doesn't stand out above countless other two-player duel games (Omen, Conquest, Netrunner, Star Realms). Will have to see how this holds up to more plays.

Update: Unfortunately I wasn't really swayed after more plays and the randomness remains a big issue.

Sold.

This reminds me a quite a bit of Omen: A Reign of War, except with dragons instead of greeks. Like Omen, the game revolves around players taking turns deploying up to three cards into three different battlegrounds and then resolving the battles when they are all filled up.

Where it differs from Omen is in how these battles are resolved and that difference is what makes this a game worthy of its own spot on the shelf. To fight a battle, players draw up a hand of cards from a second deck and then play a mini-game very reminiscent of the battle system found in the classic Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. In turn, each player plays a maneuver or a series of maneuvers and then the defending player tries to match. If they do, then they can counter attack. If they don't, they lose a dragon from the battlefield.

Eventually, only one side will have dragons remaining to claim the battlefield. The game ends after a player collects three or four battlefields, depending on what was collected.

Once you get the hang of the game's two phases, play is fast and furious. There is lots of room for combos and clever play in the dragon phase and the battle phase is full of surprises, once players start improving their combat deck with more advanced cards, a mechanic I didn't even mention above. 

The only bad thing I have to say about it is that it might have some runaway leader problems. All of my games so far have been pretty one-sided, but the game has still been interesting playing to that result. I suppose it's a little like a log rolling contest, where the action is tight but when the scoring comes, one contestant has won and is clearly dry, while the other is completely in the drink. Which means to say I think that it's over so fast that all or nothing wins don't seem as frustrating here as they often can be.

Combat mechanic is a little clunky, perhaps if dice were used or something it would be better.  I've thought about taking this and using the conflict resolution mechanic from Mouse Guard for the combat system, but don't know how that would work yet.  A deck of dice is not a very fun mechanic for combat resolution in my opinion.

A three-field tug-of-war game in the vein of Omen: A Reign of War, or Battleline.

DM's innovation is its beyoootiful dragon cards, and the ranged attack mechanic that goes off right when each dragon is played.  The art is terrific on the dragon cards, and correspondingly bland on the battle cards.

The designer is soliciting ideas for new dragons (Forest? Fury? Void Dragon?) on Kickstarter (as of Nov '14).  The whole process is a lot of fun.

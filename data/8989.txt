Hanibal described it best, two assholes riding a unicycle.  One of my best 2P games even though Jing doesn't like it.

131013 I'm not sure this will hold up over repeated plays but my initial impression is that this is an excellent sleek euro design. I really like Schaact's work in China, Hansa, and Coloretto. Can't say as much for some of his more recent fare. This is a simple game with simple rules but the more you play it, the more you realize there is a lot of intelligence running under the surface of this game.

RATING: 6
My opinion of this game has improved with more plays.  I still don't think it is great, but it is at least interesting enough for a few plays.  I still consider it somewhat processional, and it seems to be an almost purely short-term tactical game.  (Although market placement does add a small amount of strategic play.)

RATING: 8
Simple, fun, with the potential (very slight) for some brain-burning. Majority mechanic for payment of goods, movement between nodes is limited, selling of goods exacts a toll on seller (loss of market stall) and on others (item of same color is lost). All in all, a nice and simple game that doesn't get bogged down in it's own detail.

Mark Johnson I think mentioned this - but then I looked very closely at it. It looks like a classic Euro with streamlined mechanics. I had a 2-player session and enjoyed it quite a bit - but believe it will be better with 3 or 4. It is extremely smooth in mechanics and rather devious in strategy. So I like it!

It isn't a "bad" game, but it is stunningly dull to play.  The legendary dryness really is there.  This is like having the bottled essence of "Euroness" in the bad sense, with all flavor removed, poured into your gaping throat.

How's the game itself?  No idea, really, though looks to have a bit much luck, too.

I probably did not play enough this game to understand its qualities, by judging from other's opinions.

As for me, I felt that the game could sometimes become repetitive and totally fry an unfortunate player simply by the ship never reaching his outposts.

I simply did not have fun playing this game twice, but perhaps this will change with repeated plays.

Apparently, this game is best with 2 players, so here goes. My biggest problems with the game have to do with several odd rules that are easy to forget because they don't make sense thematically: (1) must have more than one good type to sell one (why?), (2) if you sell one, all opponents lose one of the same good type (why? why?), (3) at the end of your turn, if you have more than 3 good types, you lose them to taxation. Yes, they are straightforward rules and we ended up figuring it all out half-way through the game, and I can understand why they were done from a mechanic perspective, but they are not intuitive and super annoying. This one is for the trade pile.

RATING: 7.6
A beautiful, challenging game that can best be described as a nicely themed abstract. Admittedly, the theme could be stronger, since the different goods are only distinguished by colour. But that's easily resolvable: we've given an actual historical Hanseatic trade good name to each colour: blue=fish, green=grain, amber=amber, brown=furs, pink=tallow, and red=wine (OK, wine wasn't a big Hanseatic commodity, but red's gotta be something!). Bear in mind that "light themes" in a game normally turn me off: but Hansa is one glorious exception! However, a considerable negative to the game is the very great lack of player interaction. It's not a bad game at all with three or four players, but really, Hansa is at it's best with two. Hence, my rating of 7.6: an average, from 8.75 for two players, and 6.5 for three or four players.

I liked it a bit. Like all of Schacht's games that I've played, it's fast, has interesting scoring, and has some really excruciating tradeoffs that you've got to make. In China, each placement is sacrificing a placement in the other area of the region (i.e. placing a house or an emissary are mutually exclusive on a turn) and many actions will actually open up opportunities for opponents.

Here, money is extremely tight (de facto, by design) and there are just some really hard decisions to make about using your stalls up and establishing those stalls (for the bonuses) and then eventually cashing them in to get and sell goods. And then, of course, determining where to leave your ship and trying to figure out where your opponent will leave you. It's a really nice design for two.

maybe it is unfair to rank Hansa at 6. It is a good game with ease of play and some strategy. perhaps if we had found this early in our gaming "career" we might have enjoyed it. But it is so simple that we found it to be boring. It's a "trading in the Mediterranean" game but it is that genre at its most basic. So compared with games like Concordia it just cannot hold our interest. Plus the components are a joke really. The "player board"  is just a 5 inch card board cut out with a 1 inch diameter icon in the middle that represents where you put your coins. That was a waste of cardboard in all honesty. I don't need a player board just to stack my money on. So it is a basic Euro and if you are just getting started with gaming in that fashion this might be a good pick. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
{1 play, 4 player} I wanted to like it more, as the mechanisms are all soild and interesting (without being very new or different), but since your move is kinda based on the board position at the start of your turn, you can't do a lot of advanced planning (though you can still do some).  Which means, played with the "wrong" players, this can take way too long for what it is.  And with the "right" players, it's perfectly okay, without really being special... but at least it moves along :)

Just my speed, but something's lacking and the game's mechanics seem kind of "jiggered." When it's not your turn, you analyze the board more or less casually, wondering where the ship will be when your turn arrives.  By then the board will have changed, and goods will have disappeared, and your possible moves -- around two or three -- will be apparent. Having market majorities are important and can provide income from other players and free goods.

When I read the rules, I knew I would like this game, and I was right. Your play options are restricted, but not so much you don't feel like you're doing anything on your turn. 

This is the game that convinced me that turn-based online gaming is not for me. I just give; even with a game I'm halfway-decent at, like Hansa, I can't accurately visualize what's happened between turns. It doesn't really matter; I like the social aspect of boardgaming too much to really enjoy the web-based games anyhow.

This game is great.  Simple rules, but extremely deep tactical possibilities.  The different aspects of the game are very well-balanced - focus too much on one thing and you'll pay the price.

I've only played this game with two, but I believe the reviewers who say it isn't as good with 3-4. Hansa plays like a Euro but almost feels like a wargame - every turn is a direct one-on-one battle for positioning and resources.

Traded. Loved the game, but felt a bit too simple after a while.

Simplistic trading game that works great with 2 player. End scoring is always very close but the choices you make during the game is a full of dilemma, quite opposite of point salad. Feels very tight in its own way that only Michael Schacht can make.

As a trading game, this game works albeit it feels pretty dry.  The game play is mechanical and the artwork, while nice, does not add any vibrance to the game.  It's strength is in the mechanics.

Simple, elegant economic/trade game that you can teach someone in about 5-10 minutes. Many might accuse that such a game as this feels 'dry', but I really think this level of light Euro serves a good purpose when you want an engaging, strategic experience without the headache of a complex rules set. I like the artwork and components as well, and the rules are quite different than the route building and player upgrades of Hansa Teutonica, even if their titles and subject matter are so similar.

Nem egy mai játék, ami látszik is a külsején. Egy nagyon puritán, majdhogynem csúnyácska kis táblája van. A szabály nagyon egyszerű eszköztárral dolgozik, de nagyon ügyesen. Csak tologatjuk a hajót, közben korongokat rakunk fel, árut dobunk el, árukat fordítunk le, korongot veszünk vissza, pénzt fizetünk be... Kevés fajta akció van, de nagyon kombinatívnak tűnt így elsőre. Gyorsan elszaladt egy parti, kifejezetten szórakoztató volt. Az újratöltés időzítése szerintem kulcsfontosságú.

I've enjoyed my two plays. Certainly requires a bit of skills in moving the trade ship along the board to maximize your benefits and decrease your opponent's, but there is also luck involved in how those trade goods pop. I'll like to play more and identify how significant this luck factor is. Placement of influence along good trade routes and limited interference with your opponent's plans add additional elements of skill.

{2P: 6, 3P: 8, 4P: 7}

[i]Hansa[/i] is a great representation of a "standard" Eurogame.  It has a lot of components, especially for its demurely-sized box.  The set-up of the game is involved, which leads to an organizational conundrum: should you store all of the goods counters together, or divide them up by color?  I chose the latter approach, since it simplifies the process of actually getting the game to the table.  I can always spend more time cleaning a game up after everyone has left.

At first blush, the rules seem fidgety, especially when you're buying goods.  In two scenarios you pay the bank.  In another you pay a player.  In the last, you don't pay at all.  This aspect of the game turns out to merge seamlessly with the rest of the rules, but it takes a few rounds to appreciate it.  There is also the "wish you could do one more thing at this location" angst, which is mitigated by the fact that you can return to the same location during your turn if you have enough money to do so.  The "tax and tariff" phase feels like an artificially-imposed limitation, but at least it encourages you to do [i]something[/i] during your turn, instead of accumulating resources ad infinitum.

The two player game feels too resource-constrained: it's very easy to leave your opponent in a position where she will have to spend a couple of Talers to move at the beginning of her turn, and vice-versa.  The three player game is very enjoyable.  The four player game is more chaotic, but enjoyably so.  You can't plan too far ahead in the four player game, especially if the warehouses are getting depleted, and a player might refresh them before your turn comes around.  [i]Hansa[/i] is not incredibly good, but it's not broken or imbalanced, either.  It's simply a nice, average game.

Neat mechanic which just needs a dummy round to demonstrate the rules. Tends to suffer a little from AP and as you have no real idea what the other players will do or where the ship will end up you can switch off when its not your go. Results tend to be close.

Ihan mukava noin tunnin peli. Kaljankuskaus-teema tekee peliin leppoisan tunnelman, jota tosin hieman yrittää rikkoa stäbäily toisten ounaamiin kaupunkeihin.

[url=http://ballearicus.blogspot.com/2007/07/hansa_16.html]Hansa[/url] es un juego entretenido. Es un eurogame al uso, de corta duración y con poca interacción entre jugadores. Está equilibrado, la diferencia de puntos entre jugadores del mismo nivel suelen ser ajustadas. El tratamiento de las mercancías es interesante, la escasez de recursos para llevar a cabo acciones le da un cariz táctico y el factor suerte es casi nulo, exceptuando el relleno de mercancías.

No me arrepiento de haber adquirido este juego en su momento. Fue una de mis primeras compras y no me costo muy caro (20 euros creo). Lo disfrute sobradamente con mi pareja y por tanto lo considero amortizado. Actualmente ha sido superado ampliamente por otros eurogames de mi colección con mas enjundia, aunque no puedo olvidar las buenas sensaciones que me dio cuando lo adquirí y era un novato en este mundillo.

RATING: 8
What a great game.  First off it plays in an hour, even with 4 people, which is a nice.  In addition you're force to make tough decisions about what to do in your turn with your limited resources.  You're always sitting there thinking, just what is the best thing I can do?  Do I get Victory Points now, or try to establish myself for end game victory points?  Should I give myself more options by replenishing the goods?  The choices are great.

It's fun but there doesn't seem to be anyway to have long term planning as one never knows where the boat will be on his turn.  Not sure I understand the strategy after only one play. None of us seemed to. Perhaps will go up after repeated plays.

Heard this was dry, but I quite liked it. I like how the boat can only move in certain predefined directions. The direction narrows possibilities and makes it easier to plan. Would definitely play this again.

Hansa ... another in the line of Piddy Euros where you get to pick up tokens and cash in sets, with (once again) a shipping-and-trading theme.  It's harmless, and there's nothing inherently wrong with it, but at the same time it's rather dull and I can't foresee myself ever suggesting we play it.

I wish this played with more people, because it really is a sweet game. Quick, easy to explain, and has a nice flow to it. There's something about it that makes me sometimes not want to play it, but I'm not sure what that is yet. Warrants some more plays to figure out whether this one's going up or down.

One of my top games.  I like the theme of pick up and drop off, but being victim to prevailing winds.  Always a good sign when you are 1 move short of doing everything you want to.  A little area control/influence, a little race, and a lot of fun.

I enjoyed this game with 4 players, but I'm looking forward to trying it with two-- as many people suggested.  Lots of tough decisions.

This is a very elegant game--simple rules but complex decisions to be made.  It plays perfectly during a lunch hour.  The box takes very little space and the ship is a very funky, creative design.  I'm happy that I picked a copy up when Uberplay was going out of business before they were all gone.  I really like games that let you consume accumulated VP to take actions... do I save the barrel to turn in for VP or do I spend the barrel to get more booths out?  I like that.

I've only played a two player game, but I thought this was really enjoyable. An excellent balance of thoughtful strategy with game length. Scores in the two games I played were extremely close (1 point difference). Certainly analysis paralysis could be more of an issue with 3-4 players, but it's not too bad with just two players. My rating could fluctuate based on how it handles 3-4.

Certainly the heaviest Schacht I've played.  Like several games, players are basically confronted with an either/or choice.  In a city, a player can take (and possibly pay for) a good or they can trade in one goods marker to build markets or they can discard a marker to convert 2+ goods markers of a single color to VPs.  

This 3-step "resource conversion" makes Hansa a little more complex than his other games but still fairly easy to teach.  It also provides a lot of interaction as players want to corner the market on a color, have a majority of markets in a city, and (late game) have markets in lots of cities.  

He has also created a "hot potato" element where the goods are only refilled when a player pays to do it.  So, every player tries to arrange it so someone else has to do it.  

After 3 plays, I'm happy I re-acquired it.  I expect it to get a decent amount of plays.  It'll never be top-shelf, but, like many of his games, it's solid, fun, easy to teach, and very playable with a large range of groups.

Didn't like it much... given the fluctuation in the board between moves, there's almost nothing to do when it's not your turn. So when it is your turn, you're stuck doing mountains of calculations to figure out your best options, making analysis paraylsis a likely problem. Just way too much down time for my tastes...

Es un juego en el que hay que asentar puestos comerciales, para vender mercancías y acumular puntos. Está muy entretenido. Admite hasta cuatro jugadores.. aunque, imagino que para cuatro jugadores puede resultar algo caótico y dificil de planificar. La estrategia es "al momento".. escoger qué es lo mejor que puedes hacer a continuación.., porque a medio/largo plazo es muy dificil.

I didn't like the way this game played.  The buy, market stands, sell flow just seemed sort of counter intuitive to me.  But the real problem with the game is the down time.

I generally enjoy pick'n'deliver games and Hansa was no exception. Only played it once with 3 players, but the game flowed like only old-time euros can. I have read comments saying the game play does not pack many decisions, but I disagree. You need to know when to wait patiently and when you need to go broke for a big move. Man, I am even tempted to raise the rating to an 8 given how much I liked it.

It's OK, I guess. I call it "Coloretto with a boat." Tactically it gives you some interesting choices: whether to score a goods token or use it to build a market; whether to hold off on scoring until next turn, with the risk that you might lose your tokens; whether to refresh the markets at the expense of an action. But in the end it seemed kind of dull and very abstract, which was OK in a card game like Coloretto but seemed kind of dumb when you add in a board (why, oh why does the boat travel across land?). I really like the scoring used with the "Extrakarte": it makes your decisions far more interesting than with just the rules of the base game. I'll probably insist on playing with them in the future (I also might prefer to have more colors in the 2-p. game for a longer game).

Very good game from Michael Schacht.  Very simple rules yet some good tactical decisions to make.  You can think through your move and try to land the ship in a place that is poor for your next opponent.  The elegant offset to this is gambling a taler to refresh the board.  Several times I thought a player was hosed on their turn and they were able to refresh and score a big delivery.  Very nice!

I was looking for a financial management / business game.  Something similar to Puerto Rico.  This game is more like an abstract strategy game where positioning is equally as important as resource management.  The theme is so light that I could barely call this an economic or business game.  I feel that money does not feel like money, just a yellow markers.  It is a fun game but not a business game.

Only played once and found it difficult to get into as it seemed that you just had to work out the best thing you could do on that turn to earn the most points. I would like a few more plays of this and its rating may then rise. Not one I'd buy though.

Played this several times with two. Lots of tough decisions, one must scan the board before each play to isolate the best moves (or lack thereof!) Good mechanism that the best move could be not moving. Might be slow with the wrong people.

RATING: 7.5
This is the first Michael Schacht game in my collection, and boy, is it a good one.  It possesses the classical elegance of earlier German board games, where simple rules and a small set of possible actions give rise to tense, balanced gameplay where every move counts.  Set collection, pick-up and delivery, and area control are all here in a game that takes an hour or less to play.  The theme is dry (Hanseatic League trading in the 14th century) and some of the mechanics feel very artificial (like the taxes and tolls), although those are also "classical" features of German games.  Nothing earth-shattering here, but a good game that non-gamers and Euro gamers alike would enjoy.

I wanted to like this Schacht game badly.  But even for an abstract, it is not intuitive at all.  The mechanics really don't make any sense, so the non-intuitiveness clouds the fact that there is a good game in there somewhere.  Just couldn't get into it.

RATING: 6
Ohh, this game looks dry! And it really is. However, there is room for clever decisions and the placement of the ship for future turns as the ship can only sail in pre-specified directions. I haven’t tried it with 4 but I have no desire to do so as the long-term planning would be almost non-existing. The 2-player game is quite strategic and I like the 3 player game too. 

However, this is yet a light eurogame which clocks in in 45-60 minutes, and I don’t think the gameplay is that interesting after all as I tend to like meatier eurogames. I might play this a couple of times, but I wouldn’t actively seek it out.

The look and mechanics of this game just appeal to me - not sure why, as I have never played it, but it just looked like something that I would enjoy.  I will update with a rating once I play.

Played the Java version, and I suck at this game.  But it is still kind of fun.  I definitely want to play this game with real players.  It has some lasting appeal.

5 or 6 plays later, Hansa still impresses. The movement of the ship is a bit over-mechanical and constraining - but that simplifies play to ensure this game has some broad appeal. The way we've played, everybody tries like heck to NOT be the player to "refresh" the board... kind of like Chicken...

RATING: 7
They're right that this is a very tactical game.  Having said that, it's not devoid of strategy, it's just that the basic strategic insights are readily understood, and then the tactics follow almost inevitably from those strategic principles.  I like the fact that each turn requires you to optimize within narrow constraints, and that the results are always close, but I wish the strategy/tactical ratio were a little higher.

RATING: 7
(2/2/10 - 21 Plays) There is a lot less here than I used to think. This one has moved into pastime status (see: San Juan). As such, it is still an 8 or maybe a 9. But as a game, it is barely tactical and mostly bare min/max.

Old comments: My wife and I love this game. I may end up upgrading it to a 9. The only thing keeping me back is that it is just too tactical, not at all strategic. But oooh the tactics! It is just a great 2-player game that is just long enough for what it is.

This is a great little blend of action point allowance, area control/influence, and pick up and deliver. The three mechanisms work well together. 
It's a classic euro in that the theme is irrelevant, but the tactical decisions it presents are enjoyable independent of theme. 
I need to take it to game night to bask in the chaos of a 4p game.

Far more tactics than strategy, but there's a fair bit of stratgey hiding under the covers if you look for it.  Quite delightful.

One of best 2-players games! I'm sure it is better for two players than for more... You and opponent are playing same ship. Your opponent starts his turn in place you end yours. You have to optimalize your movements AND send your opponent as far as it is possible, far away of any goods. Lot of strategy, but fast and funny!

Lovely little tactical pick up and deliver, with some strategic considerations, mostly in regards to placing ones market stalls and switching to VP generation at the right time. Quite an opportunistic game, thus best with 2. Plays swiftly and smoothly, but has a bit of depth that becomes apparent with more games. Keeper.

+ Simple, solid mechanisms
+ A good mixture of easy decisions, with some tough forward calculations thrown in
+ Easy to teach
+ Nice components

= Mostly tactical
= Demands hindering your fellow players in various ways

Rating based on a dozen 2-player games. Interesting but not fascinating. Hansa seems to be a decent alternative to many Kosmos 2-player games. Might be slightly more compelling as a 3-player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Sure, Schacht games tend to be more abstract and dry....but that's never bothered me any because they are so tense and fun. Hansa is no exception. However 'dry' it may be underneath, the beauty of the board and components are very visually engaging.

In terms of gameplay, I love the tension of when to spend to refresh the goods. Its always a chance to gamble that you can do better with it than the next guy will...or try to stick someone later with the chore. Its a bit like taking the Craftsman in PR. 

The loss of goods when someone else sells that type is also a beautifully cut-throat feature. There are enough moving parts here to make for some great decisions and chances for creativity, yet the framework of the game is tight enough that players won't fall prey to endless analysis...at least not like in some other games. (Although that's never really been a big complaint of mine in game-playing.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not a bad title, very simple rule set with well-defined options, yet the money tightness on this couples with the defined shipping routes and barrel taxation at the end of your turn to make your options extremely limited.  I liked the money tax, but I thought the barrel tax made the game a tad too narrow. The *need* to screw the next player also constrains you with excruciating regularity. I'd be willing to play this again, but it mostly struck me as a fairly dry, average game.

Like many of Schact's games I feel there is a decent system here, but that everything is too tightly constrained to allow for real creativity or interesting plays.

I think this is an excellent game. It is easy to learn and understand but still requires some strategy. I should say tactics more so than strategy because by the time its your turn again the board will have changed considerably so you can't plan out too far ahead but you need to understand the flow of the game make the correct tactical decision which also allows for longer term point production. We learned another game the same night. Logistico, which as it turns out has some similarities. They are both pick up and delivery games for points or cash. I found logistico to be the deeper game by a fair margin. To me its also the better game by a fair margin. In logistico you have to look 2 or 3 turns ahead 4 if you can manage it. See my notes there if your interested.

This is almost a cliché of a Eurogame:  trading in the Baltic, pasted on theme, collecting and selling 'goods', mechanics that make no sense in reality (why would you need to remove a market to sell goods or discard goods to set up a market??) and a ship that drives across land! 
Having said all that... I love it! Simple, pleasing and elegant, like an abstract puzzle (with barrels). Good with 2, 3 or 4. It just works. And can be played in about 30-40 minutes.

This game is growing on me the more I play it. I have never played face to face, but I have play it at www.MaBiWeb.com. Mabi has an excellent implementation of this over there. I am finding that I enjoy the 2 player game the most. It has a very tactical feel. There is also and element of the game of chicken, as each player waits to see who will waste a gold piece to fill up the board again.

Played this 2 player and quite enjoyed it (even though it was quite unforgiving on my first play through). You pick up goods, build markets, sell goods to markets all the time moving a common trading ship (which you both buy and sell from) around the board.

Hansa is a typical Schacht design when he gets things Right: simple rules, easily explained, but with a few twists which render the whole pleasantly chewy. Not a heavy game by any standard, but with sufficient little twists to make your opponents look at you just a [i]tad[/i] annoyed. Schacht doesn't always succeed at this fine balance between game elements; he does here.

The game is in fact an action point-based game, with 'money' dubbing as the action points. However, the restriction that you can only take one action in a city where the ship is located, and that it can only be a single action, makes for not that easy gameplay. You don't need to think hard all the time, but at times you need to consider the effects of your move on the player coming after you. It is a screw-your-neighbour effect, but only mildly so. Between experienced players, the game can get very tight indeed, because the places where you put your markets can yield a significant amount of points. Therefore the game looks simple, and plays with that similar greased lightning feeling as Web of Power, but to play [i]well[/i] you'll need to be a bit more devious than usual. Because it is an AP game in disguise, the game has a steep (but not long) learning curve. After that, it never fails to satisfy, not even after long breaks from it. In other words, it is simply a good game. For further variation you can try and find the map 'Wechselende Winde' which comes with altered trading routes and various rule changes. Satisfaction guaranteed if you have a good feeling of the most important nodes in the original map.

In my previous version of this comment I wrote the recommendation that if you like Web of Power, you can blind Hansa blindly. That is something I don't recommend anymore because Web of Power is a majority game. However, the recommendation remains if you like the feeling of small, fast, but not too simple games.

Components: High quality, with attractive, subtle artwork, and pathing on the board that is surprisingly easy to understand.

Experience: Very sleek. It's fun to budget my turn, trying to make the best of each of my visits to a particular city. Moves along fairly quickly in a two-player game; with more, the downtime becomes a bit boring, as there is no point in planning out my upcoming turn until I know where the ship will be. But in all a fun, logical game. Probably best with 3.

Players take control of the ship and buy and sell goods, establish trading posts, and sail to find new markets. The board is a very simple map of Scandinavia, with arrows from point to point restricting where the boat is able to move. The active player takes control of the boat and must pay to move to each new city where he may either buy, sell, or expand. Players want sets of goods that they can trade for victory points, but also need to expand their market presence to generate revenue.

Nice euro game that's easy to learn and quick to play.  Contains a good mix of luck vs. skill as well as a nice mix of tactics and strategy.  A quite thinky abstract. Theme is minimal, but the pieces are of great quality and the game looks fantastic.  Counting up VPs at the end is a bit tedious, though (compared to games of similar length and complexity). Not one I will be eager to play often, but it's fun to have a go once in a while.

My first play of this was excellent.  We played it in 45 minutes, and it was a lot of fun.  Then I learned that we had a rule wrong (played with not enough barrel colors).  With the correct rules, this game really drags.  It's just not interesting enough to justify the playtime.  So if you own it, I strongly suggest you houserule it to play with 1 color per player.

Typical Schacht stuff with abstract play, tough decisions with limited resources, quick play and multiple ways to win. There's the possibility of some AnalysisParalysis, but the taxation rule helps by limiting your play options each turn.I like the "unidirectional & circular" map which makes the "one city-one action" choice hard and provides lots of options for screwing other players. Like other Schachts its often hard to tell who's winning and what to do about it. Works very well with 2,3 or 4 players.

RATING: 7
Those who say that their choices feel programmed or constricted have a point, but the upside is that play accelerates. Overlong analysis of your options could otherwise be a problem in this game, especially if you begin your turn with a fistful of money.

Hansa is delightfully simple to play,
yet even though it is mostly a tactical
game, there are some elements of strategy
that come into play, such as which cities
to place market stalls in, and where to
leave the boat for the next player.

This game always leaves me wanting more.  I see things I should have done, could have done, or was happy I did, and I want to try again.  I think that's a good thing for a game to have. Being short helps (the game time, not me - me being short sucks).

RATING: 5.5
I wanted to like this game much more, since I love the theme and enjoy these pick up and deliver games in general, but it felt kind of flat. It almost seemed like there were no meaningful decisions to be made at all, the game felt like it was somehow preprogrammed and all we had to do was just execute the only possible moves at all times, and of course wait for it to end to see who has the highest score. It is a shame, since there is a promise of a much better game hidden in there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I love how elegant this game is.  The only problem is I find the games are a little dry and sometimes people take too long to make their move so there ends up being too much down time (thinking on someone elses turn does not really help once it gets to your turn).  I loved this game to begin with but I think its the down time that hurt it in the end.  At the same time, I have played this game more than a lot that I have rated higher.

RATING: 7
Right now, because it is new to me (1 play so far), I want to play it and I will be suggesting it for 3 or 4 players...thus it is an 8.  Hansa is simple, short-term, tactical game with a hint of the "pick-up and delivery mechanic".  You establish booths on the board by picking up goods and delivering to those spaces.  Later you pick up goods and sell to these booths for VPs.

There are a lot of gamers that enjoy games that can be taught in under 5 minutes and played in under an hour.  If you are one of these gamers, I recommend it as it does offer a lot for such a short play time.  For me, the theme is too thin for it to go above 8.  And as I play it a bit more, I expect it to drop some as I will only want to play it sporadically.  I'm guessing it will probably settle around a 6.

RATING: 5
Elegant game themed on the Hanseatic League shipping goods around the Baltic.  On their turn, a player controls the ship, moving it from port to port and interacting there - buying goods (costs money), setting up markets (costs goods), selling goods (costs markets).  Moving the ship also costs money, and there isn't enough of it.  Tricky at first, and slightly nasty (the selling forces all others to discard goods of that type).  Typical of the Michael Schacht "heavy light" game that he seems to do so well - fast playing but there is some thinking to do.  Excellent 45 minute boardgame.

Perfect information, simple rules, quick playing but hard to master. Could be seen as a little to chaotic when played with 4 (don't try to plan ahead, simply play the board when your turn comes around). Fun to play. Wish it would hit the table more often.

RATING: 8.5
Michael Schacht designs some consistently solid games, that seem halfway between an abstract strategy game and a euro (Patrician is another example).  I really love this style of game so this was definitely a hit with me.  It has some pretty unique mechanics regarding how the market stalls and goods work.

Update: This worked really well as a 2 player game with Kelsey and I, and my rating reflects the 2 player game.  I haven't tried with more players yet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
[Schacht] We nicknamed it FANTA: the Nordic Soda Game. It's a clever pick-up-and-deliver game. It reminds of the Wallace's Volldampf series but much much better. By adding more constraints such as one-way routes and pairs of goods, Schacht reduced the paralysis problems of other pickup-and-deliver games. This foreces you to 'play from the gut' instead of mini-max. Highly recommended middleweight.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Awesome game. Another big hit by Michael Schacht. I played it with four players, and it was actually pretty good despite complaints that things change too much before you can act again. It should be even better with 3 or 2 players.

I had a hard time getting into this.  The theme is bone dry.  The map is pre-programmed.   The options are heavily over-constrained, with only one "best play" per turn.  And, you can't plan ahead since you have no idea where your starting point will be.  As such, there isn't any significant interaction between players.  On the other hand, it's an easy-flowing game and can be played casually while you talk about other stuff.  I'd like to try it again and see if my rating would change, maybe with less players.

I found Hansa to be very interesting the first time I played the game. Maybe it was because I won my first game.

I have replayed Hansa a few more times since than. It's a simple and fun game. It doesn't look like much, but there is a lot to calculate to do when it's time to decide what to do with your actions.

It's quite interesting to figure out what to do with your money. One coin per action. Lots of possibilities, including screwing your oppenent when depending where the boat finishes on your turn.

I would want to play the game again sometime soon. Looking forward to my next game.

I found Hansa to be extremely frustrating.  You have to burn your victory points in order to branch out your markets.  That just seems silly to me.  Oh, and the board has far too many spots that can be manipulated by a crafty player to basically burn an opponents turn.  Get circling around Stockholm, Copenhagen and Lubeck (I think?), and your opponent has no choice but to continue your path for at least 2 more turns before they can change the direction of the boat.  Also, I dislike games that basically come down to one decision (took a 2 barrel when I should have taken a 1) to lose the game.

Its the perfect "real" Euro game to play with a friend or two to introduce what a "real" game. Pandemic, Forbidden Island, those are pretty tame/lame as far as thinking about how to win go. A good game of Hansa is a brain burner and only the person who makes the best moves wins.

It's been a while since I've played this, but I'll try to comment on what I recall. This was a pick-up and deliver game that felt mostly abstract. There was nothing particularly bad about it, but there was nothing that really grabbed me either. I think the most defining thing I remember was that it seemed like the game would play very similar from game-to-game, which generally doesn't work very well in a game's favour. The game probably works best with 2 and there are other games for 2 I would prefer to play.

Great strategic fun at all player counts and many tough choices.  Easy rules, very puzzly (somewhat AP inducing), but involves much planning and for such a simple game. It  has enough depth too, depending on whether one is monitoring the metagame information.  Always a tight finish and has some mild take-that and player interaction.  Theme is there, though dry, this is certainly not an abstract.  Quick to set-up and teach, Hansa is a game I always enjoy playing and one which will certainly remain in my collection.

Mildly interesting game with pleasant graphics quality.  Efficient play requires some advance planning, but options are sufficiently limited to prevent over-analysis.  Theme integration is weak.  Generic commodities (barrels) would have been better made specific: beer, cloth, amber, etc.  Odd that "selling" goods doesn't yield a payoff in money, but only in victory points.

RATING: 3
I really wanted to like this game - I thought it would be right up my alley.  But after eight 2-player plays, I have come to the sad conclusion that I really can't.  It's just too boring.

I was certainly warned about this - plenty of these comments complain that it is too dry.  But usually dry doesn't bother me.  For example, many call Caylus "dry," and I love it.  But this isn't just dry.  It's boring.  

Although there is only a moderate amount of luck, at the same time it doesn't feel like it really has much strategy.  Sure, you have to do a decent bit of calculation each turn to figure out your optimal move.  But there are no tense decisions - you just think a little while, and then do what makes sense.  It feels kind of flat.

Contributing to the flat feeling is the fact that there is little in the way of long-term strategy, and (unlike Caylus), no way to gain a lasting advantage.  I had hoped that the "claiming routes" mechanic would provide this, but it largely fails too.  It is just too easy for your opponent to overbuild you in your key city and thus destroy what you've built (granted, I have the same issue with most area-majority games).  

Finally, the game has no sense of progress - no beginning, middle and end.   You do the same thing every turn, and then the game is over.  It is strikingly homogenous - and, unfortunately, rather boring.

I find it difficult to rate Michael Schacht's games. Ultimately, the games work, everything that is supposed to be there is there and they mesh together quite well. In Hansa, there are some very neat combinations of area-control, pick-up-and-deliver, multiple victory paths etc. But they are very dry. I don't see how people can complain of Knizia having dry designs. Schacht's designs feel like they came from the deepest part of the Sahara. I enjoyed playing Hansa and I don't mind playing it if someone suggested it, but it's not a game that gives you that desire to want to play it again.

Scandinavian merchants and trading, very elegant, good depth with simple rules and quick play-time; although some consider it quite dry.  Good with three, very good with two.  A classic euro from Michael Schacht.  

For a comparison with another Schacht pickup-and-deliver game, see: [thread=804878][/thread]

Hansa has stood the test of time, and still enjoys significant respect from those looking for a clean and elegant euro game. Michael Schacht has produced a very sleek design that has the potential to satisfy gamers today just as it did when it first appeared almost a decade ago. There may be pickup-and-deliver games that have more chrome, more complexity, and more thematic flavour, but there are very few games in this niche that can match Hansa's elegance and sharply tactical nature, where a very simple rule-set is combined with a quick game-time and genuine depth of gameplay. Hansa is an excellent three player game, and turns into a terrific battle of wits when played with just two. Attractive components help round out what is an excellent value package. If you enjoy a sharply tactical and quick playing euro, and particularly have a fondness for the pickup-and-deliver mechanic, then Hansa is an essential game to check out!

Michael Schacht is best at creating games with very simple rules with a high amount of strategic thinking to play well.  China / K&K may be his best work but this is a good one too.  The monotone of the board looks a little boring and the game feels very abstract & dry (Yellow goods, Black goods, Pink Goods, etc. lol).  The best aspect of the game is how players can force others to flip over their collected sets.  There can be a tendency for "analysis paralysis" while players try to efficiently move the boat around.  Grade: C

* Played 15+ times. My initial enthusiasm seems to be well-founded. A solid and enjoyable little game. With some sort of passing resemblance to Web of Power but with a pick up and deliver mechanism, the game is simple, interesting, and well themed. Balancing between expanding markets, buy, or selling is a hard one, and players will keep each other on their toes. Here's a economic game that is light enough to attract a fair portion of non-gamers. Very linear tactical game, but great system. PLAYS VERY WELL WITH 2!!! [f/tr:Androm]

This is a beautiful game to look at and so far I like it best as a two player.  It feels choppy to me with more players.  I like how you can save money for a turn, then restock the board and go on a sailing spree and pick up several sets of goods and convert them into points all in one big turn.  This seems to happen more in a two player game.  I'm no expert but it's fun!  I think this game has a great pace and the weight is on the lighter side but still interesting.

Hansa is an old-school game, one with few rules that still manages to create interesting dilemmas. How do I help myself most without helping others?

It's quite restrictive (which is part of what makes it interesting) and quite tactical, though, so not everybody's cup of tea.

Probably will change with more plays.  I like how intuitive this game feels from the start.  The actions are simple, but the choices difficult as a lot of the time you don't have the resources to achieve what you need.  Small screwage factor if you can place the ship in a difficult position for the player on your left.  I do like how all aspects in this game are tied in with one another - it gives the game a nice flow.

Update: I like how well Hansa scales from 2 to 4 players.  The weight and time commitment feel spot on, as the game always manages to feel fresh and never drags.  The game feels more strategic with two, but I also like how the game plays more intuitively with more.

I'm not typically fond of abstracts so I hesitated for a long time but finally got Hansa - primarily because it has a short playing time and purportedly played well with 2. We both like it, and it does play well with 2.  It has a bit of luck (the goods are replenished randomly) and lots of room for clever play without being too much of a brain burner.  Good game.

Ahhhh, Hansa. A good end-of-the-night game. Light but far from boring. Everyone takes turns moving a boat around to set up market booths and acquire goods across the map. Each person shares the one boat to get around the map which opens up a few interesting strategy options each turn. Plays especially well with 3, great with 2, a bit long and drawn out with 4.

A solid game with some counterintuitive rules. But simple and quick enough to enjoy when you have only 45 minutes. And it scales well so why not to give it a try?

This is the fourth game by Michael Schacht that I played and the fourth that I was dissapointed with. Not because it is a bad game - it just lacks that something that makes the solid game a great one.

I don't usually enjoy Schacht-games, but Hansa is an exception. Lots of tactical decisions combined to certain amount of long-time planning works nicely. Enough control to make your turns interesting and leave the next player into a tight spot. Could get painful with AP-prone players, though.

Another great Schacht design, up there with Web of Power, Coloretto, and Richelieu.

This is a fine strategic game that has players competing against one another as merchants in the Hanseatic League. Gaining market presence and selling goods for victory points are the key components here, but a lot of a player's success depends on the movement of the shared ship used to reach different towns along the Baltic and having a majority market presence in various towns. This game presents a nice challenge in determining how best to balance the different components of the game that contribute to earning victory points. I've enjoyed it every time I've played, though it can certainly be frustrating when you find yourself on the short end of trading stick.

RATING: 6
Mechanical, purely tactical game that appears to almost plays itself, yet is mildly pleasant.  I find that the choices are very limited, and there's often an obviously "correct" or optimal play.  The game drags a bit while each player puzzles out his route for the turn - something that requires some planning, yet can't be done ahead of time because of uncertain board position.  The lack of ability to plan ahead combined with the puzzle-like feel of the turns leads inevitably to players filling the down time with a discussion of what the current player should or could do.  This kind of ongoing commentary doesn't really bother me, but I know that it would annoy some players.  So far, it seems to be much more satisfying with 3 players than with 4.

Five plays, once with two and four times with three. A good middleweight game—each turn is its own brainteaser, but there's an overarching need to balance point gains against board presence. The only down side is that in a three- or four-player game a careless player could hand the win to the person on his left. Maybe best with two for that reason?

This is a wonderful game that has strong tactical elements without being "chaotic". While being rated fairly highly on the geek, I feel that it has not been so widely recognized and played as it deserves. Perhaps this is because one typically needs to play it a few times before enjoying it fully and it can easily come across as a bit "dry" after first play.

Have only played 2p, which is a thinky starvation puzzle (can you get something that's good for you without leaving an even better opportunity for your opponent?) and way more interesting than a game like this-- shipping goods in the Baltic and you don't even know what the goods are, just color-coded barrels-- has any right to be.

In particular, the production and theming make it feel *old*, and when I read the rulebook, the mechanics did too. It was only once I started playing, and understood how much of the mechanical interest is embedded in the geography of the board, that I got excited about Hansa.

Very attractive board and components. Very well balanced. You must pay careful attention to what other players have, what they can do, and how far they can move the ship.

My wife played this at a game group and enjoyed it a lot, and said we could buy it, so I sure wasn't going to refuse that.  :o)  I played her once on mabiweb.com and thought it was okay, though it didn't grab me all that much.  But we ordered it and after playing it again with her I understood it all a lot better and enjoy it quite a bit now.  It takes some getting used to the idea of the currents, compared to most other games.  What do you mean I can only sail one way??  A simple, yet very clever design.  

The more I've played this, though, the more I think that it's an excellent game for 2 players, but gets worse with more players.  With 2 players, everything you do has meaning and an impact on your game and the other player's game.  With more players, what options you're left with is much more of a matter of what only the player before you did, which was a matter of what the player before them did... your planning options are mostly left to chance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It seems to be a fine game, but what you can do depends a lot on where the previous player left the ship. In my only game, one player basically handed in the victory to another. Also, the boring theme is not even well developed, with nameless products distinguished only by color.

Have only played as a 2-player game, but it is very good with just two. Highly strategic and tactical - not only do you have to set up your markets for future opportunities, you have to pay attention to where you're going to leave the ship each turn so as to limit your opponent's opportunities.  The play is incredibly tense, as you have limited "action points" (your money limits your moves) on each turn, but you might be in a situation where you have to pay your opponent (thereby increasing their action points) in order to carry out a necessary move! If one player gets too heavily concentrated in certain cities, commit just enough to make them escalate, but don't seriously fight them - a diversified strategy seems a much better way to go.

Hansa is a Schacht game with a German merchant/trade theme, which uses a map where all players use a common trading vessel, but must follow the wind-driven paths on the board.

As others have commented this can be a rather random game for multiple players, but for two players the control of the ship's placement is better, and the timing of replenished goods becomes an interesting part of the gameplay.

I loved anticipating others' moves, figuring out the best way to get the ship to the barrels I want, keeping track of the market stands, finagling money from other players... basically everything about this game. 

I definitely prefer Changing Winds, not because of the movement abilities but because of the scoring.

I like this game.  Classic Euro-game features.  Only downside is that some turns don't seem to offer many choices - particularly if you have a really good player to your "right".

Given the choice, I think I prefer to play with the [gameid=28762] expansion/variant (which makes the game a 7 for me).  It tends to open the strategy / tactical options up a bit more.

I really wanted to like this game.  It really is very "neat" with a lot of things going on.  The interactions aren't intuitive, but after you play for a bit they become almost logical.  What really killed it for me though was the complete inability to plan ahead.  You won't know where the ship is until right when your turn starts.  This means oodles of dry downtime since each person doesn't start to analyze board position until it's their turn.

However, the downtime isn't bad in a 2-player game or in a play-by-web setting.

My first play went very well. Self-styled tactical game I believe has strategy as well as you can't just be a rudder-less boat and spin about. There's tricky decisions to make on every turn particularly if you want to influence the player going after you. I particularly like how simple the rules are.

Clean, elegant design. I really like this type of easy-to-teach-but-somewhat-meaty middleweight game. One criticism is that you can't really do much planning when it's not your turn. So don't play with players who take forever on their turns -- but I could say that about any game.

This game scales amazingly well and is equally solid with 2,3, or 4 players.  This as a light "gamer's game" which is very, very good and of almost perfect length.  This may be elevated to a "9" or "10" after more playings.

UPDATE:  A good game, but its lack of "fun factor" lowers my desire to play it.

RATING: 6
A nice little game of p/u & del with a simple elegant ruleset that unfortunately fails to deliver any depth (unlike Dorra's elegant rulesets). 

This is a wholey tactical affair where planning ahead is near impossible for the most part, especially with more than 2 at the table. A tad of screwage thrown in with the ship movement but even more so with the selling of the goods (won't happen often in 2 player but will with 3 & 4).

The luck is fairly low and it mostly keeps you interested in a 2 player game, I wouldn't bother playing 4 as it just wont be worth it, 3 should be okay but in the end there are much more intersting choices around even for 3. Might keep it for a 2 player filler game (2 players 20 minutes)

For years this sat on my shelf because I couldn't get my head around what seemed like counterintuitive elements (paying money for goods but not making it when you sell; losing a market when you sell goods, etc).

Port-to-port trading around the Baltic. Initial rating based on a single game. The game was fun and quite deep, although of course we only began to scratch the surface of the strategies involved. It's typical Schacht in the sense that it's extremely abstract with minimal rules. Don't play expecting to feel like a Hanseatic trader. :-)

Not a bad game, but dry. The theme doesn't do much for me, and while there are plenty of decisions to make, none of them excite me. I'd play this over many games, but it's only a bit of a step up from non-themed abstracts for me.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (September 2015)

Hansa was another game I wasn’t too keen on trying. In fact I bought it by mistake thinking it was Hansa Teutonica (a game I love). However I was (more or less) pleasantly surprised.

The game rules are pretty easy to learn and teach, you can explain it under 15 minutes. The gameplay is also quick if you don’t have any AP prone player. The game components and art are nice.

It is, eminently, a tactical game, you don’t have much to think in other players turn because the game situation will change a lot between turns, due to this, the downtime can be excessive. In your turn you have (somewhat) interesting choices to make (to sell, to create a new office, to add counters to the map) although many times they are obvious. You are completely at the mercy of your right neighbor, if they leave the boat far away from your objectives you won’t accomplish much, on the other side of the same coin, an unexperienced/benevolent right neighbor can cause king making situations. 

Perhaps it is best with 3 players, I will test this soon.

Another issue that I may have with the game is that in our play, all our scores were very similar. I’m not sure if that is an usual occurrence in this game or if it was only that particular time. I generally don’t like games in which a player cannot dominate VP wise because I feel it is luck that decides the match. Perhaps Hansa doesn’t belong in this category but I need more plays to really see. 

Bottom line, Hansa surprised me. For now I’m keeping the game in my game collection. I want to play it again soon to decide if I should keep it or sell it.

RATING: 9
The same trading marker (a ship) is moved by each player along shipping channels (which are unidirectional but there are multiple choices and several loops) where they either use resources to establish markets or use their established markets to acquire more resources.

We've only had a few 2P games but I gotta say this game is sweeeeet, despite being dry :).

The rules are simple and excellent, the presentation is very pleasant, and the mix of strategy and tactics choices are going to have me pondering with delight for quite a few games to come. There's a couple of mild reality gaps in the theme, but the balance of play currently has me wanting as many games as are on offer.

This makes a great 2-player game!  The simple board is deceptive.  There is a lot of depth to the decision-making. The players both control the same ship, and actions can only be taken in a city where the ship goes.  So you can think you are all set up for some great move...then the ship goes away on the other player's turn.  Played once with 3...it was good (though it was the first game and we missed some important rules).  My favorite is with 2!

Got the Changing Winds board.

This is another game that I rarely do well in but yet love to play. It is often refered to as dry but I don't find it so. There is not as much strategy available as in some games and it is impossible to plan ahead because you will never know what the board will look like or where the ship will be when until it becomes your turn again. Not necessarily a bad thing; not every game has to allow for advanced planning. Sometimes its a nice change of pace to simply have to make the best of each present situation. 

A fun game that has gone over well with everyone I've shown it to and my circle of friends are not gamers at all.

Each turn is an optimization puzzle--but boring. Move a ship around and decide between trading goods for shops, shops for victory points, victory points for shops...  Even with 2p hard to contain your opponent, so hard to develop anything like a strategy or even tactics more than one move ahead. There's no narrative to the game either. I can see accountants loving this game so am surprised so many enjoy it. // For Sale

Played once, with 3 players.

Very dry/abstract - theme is weak.  Downtime during opponent turns.  Some analysis paralysis, but your options are sufficiently limited that this isn't too much of a problem.  The player interaction is fairly minor - the biggest impact you can have is to place the ship inconveniently for your opponents.  Seems to have a large first-player advantage.

Tidy and brief game of Baltic Sea commerce. It even has a very mild form of interaction, where you can eliminate opponents' goods if you are able to sell yours of the same color at the right moment. 

It seems the thing to do is get plenty of markets out on the board in the first few turns (even if it means converting a triple barrel). That way you won't have to burn money later in the game to move the boat very far to get to one of your markets--and you will probably collect some money from other players along the way as they buy goods.

RATING: 7
I was excited when I read about this one. However, the game didn't really "float my boat". Each player has a number of action points to play on her turn. You can move the ship, pick up goods, build markets, and sell goods for VP. All neat stuff but the game didn't do anything for me. I paid my gold made my move and awaited my next turn.

Juego normalito en el que todos desplazan el mismo barco por los distintos puertos para ir recolectando barriles.

Mechanics of the game do not really click for me. Also the way the theme is placed upon the mechanics feels pretty unsatisfying to me. (You do not get any income for selling goods? Other player lose goods because you sold some of yours? Your influence in a port gets smaller by selling goods there?...)

Hansa is a unique game of acquiring goods and then traveling around the game board, going from city to city, setting up markets, and selling goods to get VP's.  Its a very tactical game.  I'm going to start paying more attention to this designer Michael Schacht.

Played 2 player, enjoyed it, but it is a bit dry with no real theme.

The game is purely economical, with trading, monopolies, and where to invest your markets.

Was very easy to learn.

Luck was not an issue: market tiles are drawn at random (up to 6 different colors with 1,2,or 3 barrels), but the merchant ship can go on multiple paths, giving you better control on which one to hit.

This creates a bank of decisions to make each turn to provide best return and high player interaction since selling your goods drops demand and forces a player to discard a like-color good (call it player screwage if you will).

The hour went by quickly.

The production values were great, enjoyed the beautiful board and colors.

This is a really good rules-light, strategy-heavy game.  I like how you have to balance your management of your money, your trade goods, your market booths, AND the position of the merchant ship that all players can control.  The only drawback is that it can be a little dry and maybe a touch boring at times.  Still, a lot of bang for the buck.

A quite clever game. I really like the idea that all players move the same ship around the board. It makes you think on your turn to make sure you don't leave it somewhere advantageous for the next player. The game also interesting choices to make when it comes to paying to pick up goods, using markets to trade the goods in for points, or trading the goods in to set up more markets. 

A few times we have played it it has seemed to me the 4th player always ends up with few goods to choose from and has to be the one to pay to restock them. It could be just be weak play on our part though, I'm not sure yet. I've only played it with 2 and 4 also. I wonder if 3 is its sweetspot.

Hansa is essentially an action point system game where the AP's are money.  The more money you have, the more AP's you can use on your next turn.  You want to optimize your chances of acquiring & using Goods (especially the "3" discs), while leaving the ship in the worst position possible for the next player(s).  There are multiple paths to acquire victory points.

It took me 3+ plays to finally understand this game. The first plays left me scratching my head but two things changed. One, I printed off a players aid found on the geek. This allowed me to focus on the game instead of the rules as I would always mix up how goods/markets/money interchange. Second, we play that it costs two talons to go against the current. This provides many more options where options were lacking.

Good for two players using the variant described above. That said, I usually would rather play other games.

RATING: 7
I've rated it 7 but with admitted uncertainty; I think I need to play this game more and with multiple players. I've only been able to play two-player sessions. The game is highly tactical, which is fine, but since the board will almost certainly be significantly altered by the time it gets to your turn *and* your starting position will not be known until then, it's virtually impossible to do any planning during other player's turns, so you end up passing that time thinking what they should do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The gameplay takes a little bit to wrap your head around---although the game turn is fairly straightforward, it is not always intuitive.  Although on the surface it looks like any number of Euro trading games, the resources do have some unique dependencies.  To add markets to a city, you have to pay a goods marker.  To sell a goods marker, you have to remove a market.  As a result, this feels like a game of reinvestment, as you have to constantly reinvest money, goods, and stalls.  The game is very tactical---turns are short and you can only keep three or fewer goods and money each turn, so you never feel like you're building towards anything.  The combination of these things makes the game one of incremental advantages and efficiencies.

Still, we found the game okay.  The gameplay feels "clever" rather than intuitive, but after a couple of plays it does start to flow.  Even more so than other typical Euro games, it's a game of handling fine balances.  The two player works fine, although it does feel a little too short.

A trading game with interesting mechanics.  You can setup stalls in various locations and also acquire trade goods.

I received [i]Hansa[/i] in my first successful math trade.  The rules are much simpler than the game's newer counterpart [i]Hansa Teutonica[/i] (which I think we played a half dozen times before we got the rules completely right). And while [i]Hansa Teutonica[/i] is a pretty quick game to play, [i]Hansa[/i] is even quicker. Maybe it doesn't have quite the depth of [i]Hansa Teutonica[/i], but we still found it a nice little abstract with a suitably pasted Euro theme.

Vasel writes: "I'm sure that there a lot of players who will really enjoy Hansa, as it is a fine game of analytical reasoning, and the mechanics seem to be flawless. But when you read people's comments on the game, the words "dry", "boring", and "bland" keep recurring. There's a reason for that, and that same reason keeps me from enjoying the game. Exciting mechanics, like in Maharaja, can help me ignore a nonexistent theme. Good, solid mechanics, like those in Hansa, don't. Many people will enjoy this dusty, dry game, just probably not"

YET the game is rated quite respectfully and:
It plays VERY well with 2. A read of the comments suggests that this is a GREAT game (and can be played with 2 in sometimes as little as 15 minutes).
It plays in under 60 minutes (and possibly faster)

Seems like it has a nice relaxing feel to it. Nothing too deep,; just a comfortable gaming experience with BUT Nothing screaming to get it ASAP. 

A couple's Geeklist commented that: "This is the race game that I thought Around the World in 80 Days would be. This plays very well with two players, has a variety of strategic and tactical options, and a nice balance of luck too. You always seem to be a dollar short for what you want to accomplish, making for a nice tension. There is an element of "take that" with the ship's movement, as you try to maximize your move advantage while minimizing future moves for your opponent."

Shanon Appelcline on RPG gives it a 4 for style and 5 for substance. He says it's his favorite release of 2004. Interestingly, and in CONTRAST to many of the other player comments, he says: "It's a real gamer's game that doesn't have a lot of socialization and which requires careful tactical thinking. If you like very strategic or tactical games, you'll be very pleased with this one; if you're looking for lighter or more casual fare, this probably isn't the right game for you."

Much more fun than I thought it would be.  The first few turns were a little slow as we learned the game, but afterwards moved along nicely.

Very tactical. Though the board changes too much from one turn to the next to be particularly strategic, especially in a >2p game, you can still develop a long-term game plan (flip a ton of goods markers, turn in goods markers to get markets everywhere) and stick to it.  Pretty board, good quality bits, familiar theme but doesn't feel at all like a duplicate of anything else.  I like it a lot and think it'll get lots of play at our house.

RATING: 5
After one play: not much game in the game! I don't like graphs, it's not intuitive to human beings to understand graphs, Power Grid is already a graph complicated enough for my liking. In Hansa it's taken to the extreme: you has to manage directed graph, influence you have at each node, calculate what you can snatch easily, how not to give opponent an easy kill, etc. etc. etc. And the final effect of your efforts is another mere anonymous pair of chits in you possession. Ok, I guess the game is quite deep in stategy, but not rewarding enough to make for the brain power cost. Demands: name and improve the goods, it makes the difference to snatch 'marble' instead of 'orange chit'. I guess a little RPG elements (individual ships, ship experience, quests) would be nice but it would be completely different game afterwards. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great companion to Web of Power. This one is more tactical, drier, and a little tough. So it's understandable that Hansa has some mixed reaction. Still, everything about this sort of game--from the box size to the components to the light strategy--hits my sweet spot. That it plays well with 2 players is another bonus. Don't be afraid to take small turns, carrying over plenty of goods & gold (even at some risk).

Have now played the Changing Winds expansion map, and I don't think it's different enough to be worthwhile. It includes the "postcard expansion" with the endgame bonuses, which I don't care for.

Many comments about being too dry, shied me away from it - but finally tried it out on Mabiweb. And it was ok.  The gameplay appears to be slightly too restrictive and there is luck with which barrels get placed where.  In many ways the game is like Tikal, as you must optimize your moves each turn while trying to set yourself up for future turns (although it feels like you have less control). So overall, the mechanics are nice and neatly fit together, but might be too restrictive.

A little dry but I don't use that term in a derogatory manner.  With the right opponents this one will see many plays.

Interestingly (to me anyway), my 9 and 11 year olds really like this one. Their level of desire to play it given its abstract nature surprised me.

Update: Played 18 times in 2005-2013. I prefer it with 3. Obviously, you have more control in 2-player, but I find it too open. My rating of 8 stands.

Played 20-25 times. Simple mechanics but still some decisions to make. Too bad they didn´t put various commodities on the tiles rather than generic barrels. It would have added a lot of atmosphere without adding any new rules. Only played 2- and 3-player, which works well.

Schacht. 2-4, best with 2 says BGG poll.

A very good two player game with movement and trading at its core.  Need to be careful not to leave the ship in good position for the opponent.  The unknown victory points mean that unless there is an obvious leader, second place isn't likely to fall into a morale slump - means the game can be enjoyable throughout.  I can see this game getting some more table time

A simple game which plays like breezing of trade wind. Light and non-aggressive. That said, your action has more influence to your opponents than the average solitaire-like euros.

I like the theme and mechanics very much. I have played only with four players to date and have found that players have very little to do when it's not their turn in a 4-player game--the ship and goods situation can change a lot before the turn comes around again. I think this game would really be much better with 3 or, better yet, with 2.

RATING: 7
04/15/04 Received.   Elegant 
A good player plans out his moves to maximize the return on the talers he'll spend to get where he wants to go and do what he wants to do. Once in a while this leads some into analysis paralysis, yet 95% of my games clock in at an hour. The only quibble I have with the game is the publisher/designer never says what the six goods are; they're just generic colors. All it would have taken would have been to add one sentence to the rules saying what each is, like: salted herring, pitch, tar, hemp rope, lumber, furs, grain, etc. But nooooooo. And Europeans wonder why American think Euro games have little or no theme!   
As of 09/12/17 I've played 37 games, winning 21 (56.7%) of them.

I enjoyed this one after one play even though I was pretty clueless until about we were about 75% into the game. I'd like to play more, but I do think I like China better.

Update: Played again. It's a good game that I'm no good at. For some reason my mind won't grasp the patterns.

Update: It took four games, but I finally get it. I also get this: this is a good, simple game.

Update: not my favorite with 4. Superb with 3 and pretty damn good with 2. 

Final update: this is a good game, and pretty smooth, but I just have trouble getting into it.

RATING: 7.5
Game in a Nutshell: On your turn, pay to sail a community ship around and buy goods, spend goods to set-up markets, and use your markets to sell goods for victory points. Next, it's another player's turn to take over the ship and do the same thing.

Played as: 2,3 player

Pros: One of the cleanest games out there. The board, while small looking and simple at first glance, is the perfect size to make decisions easier then one might think. That said, there's still plenty of decisions to make of how to best optimize what turns you have. Game plays fast enough and leaves open some time to socialize between turns such that the downtime isn't such a big deal. And as an outside plus, I love how sturdy the cardboard in this game is... the feel of goods markers really puts a ray of sunshine in my heart.

Cons: I can't get a strong sense of underlying depth and it doesn't have much in the way of interaction or excitement (really, I have no idea why it gets played as much as it does). Extremely loose theme makes the game a little hard to grasp before playing (but still flows nicely once it gets going). Luck might come into play more then I realize right now with the turning of goods markers. Setup takes a little long-- 5-10 min.

Other: Before playing, I felt the rules made this look too abstract and mechanical. Once it gets going though, that feeling gets thrown out the window and it's really quite fun. Still looking forward to a four player game as I'm hoping the competition for market dominance will tighten up.

Best Use: Light-n-dry choice for three that comes in under an hour.

Another Schacht game with pasted theme.  I guess he's just not my designer.  And, what's with the overland route for the ship?

Board also very bland to look at.

Hansa has players taking the role of merchants, sailing around the Hansianic Sea to buy, sell and establish market booths for trading. The amount of Talers you have dictates your movement and the actions you can take. The fundamental game mechanic of this game is superb! The game play itself is simple and easy to understand but the choices are always limited. Since everybody controls the ship, it%u2019s hard to plan too far ahead and players are forced to react to other player%u2019s movements. It%u2019s a good light-medium to medium type game that has minimal player interaction (mostly from moving the ship around). Recommended!

A lean, even austere game of limited options, with movement restricted to a small number of one-way routes and a single ship shared by everyone, and end-of-turn taxation keeping you from hoarding more than three goods or talers from turn to turn. The trick is to achieve what you can with an eye toward leaving the next guy in a less than optimal position. Sometimes biding your time and doing very little is the best play. [8 plays]

Wow. CortexBomb hits the nail on the head once again.

I appreciate the clean, abstract system. As with China, I come away from the rules impressed and love how easy it is to explain the game. I go in expecting a Knizia game, in which surprising complexity emerges from simple rules, but instead the opposite happens. As CortexBomb notes, everything is so constrained--the limits on tokens and thalers from round to round, the proscribed route for the ship, the need to avoid hooking up the player following you--that the opportunity for creativity is eliminated. At best, you've got a simple little puzzle to deal with on your turn. Not terrible, but not very compelling either.

People often ask what is the difference between a "tactical" vs. a "strategic" game.  Hansa is a perfect example of a tactical game.  To succeed you must be able to make the best of whatever situation the previous player left you as far as board state is concerned.  The ship may not be where you want it, so you have to make do with what you have.  You can build market booths all over the board which will make your future turns more profitable, but in general much of what you do each turn is by the seat of your pants.  I would rank it similar to Carcassonne because both games are mildly amusing but not really satisfying.

Hansa is highly a highly tactical game with a very similar feel to Tongiaki. It is balanced and well executed, and requires serious thinking and calculation. However, it has a lot of down-time which can hardly used for move-planning. Moreover, it can easily happen that a player cannot do anything productive on his move for several turns, making the game into a frustrating game experience. Lastly, it has a bad 'right-player-problem', i.e. whoever sits on your right determines how well you are doing.

For two players, these problems largely disappear (you only have yourself to blame) so it would rate a 6 or 7.

Acquired, June 9, 2008 eBay

My copy is by Uberplay and picked up on Ebay for dirt cheap.  Suburb shipping game, where you collect barrels of goods to either sell for victory points or use to set up ports on the map, thus reducing your costs.  Your actions cost points.  Trick is when you gather barrels, you can't keep them too long, because if somoene ships the goods of a certain color before you, you can loose your goods.

I like this game, and feel it does not get to the table often enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Hansa seems to garner a lot of comments along the lines of... decent little game... good but a little dull... not too exciting but I can see why people like it as it's a solid system with interesting decisions throughout... plays quickly and cleanly but a little dry and "gamey".

I somewhat echo these sentiments. The game is a pretty dry abstract representation of trading in the Hanseatic League. I like the game as it does deliver a nice clean set of mechanisms for some tactically and strategically rewarding game play. There is a look ahead element as you set up your trading areas... you have to effectively and efficiently use your limited resources and position yourself to at the same time benefit yourself while not helping (and hopefully foiling) your opponents. The game probably could quite easily be even better than the 7.5 I rate it... I'd hazard a guess that it could be a full point higher if it had just a little extra spark. I'm not quite sure what the game lacks... I think better components would help somewhat. The game feels somewhat "2 dimensional"... too flat in a way. It seems a trading game of sailing to ports while buying and selling different goods should have a bit better set of components... more tactile I suppose. I don't value theme highly in my games so what theme it has is sufficient. It's just that the game almost feels like it could just as easily been made into a card game with the board and components almost an afterthought. 

In the end I like this game and my rating will probably rise slightly rather than fall as this is the type of game I like... clean and efficient with a nice playing pace and a decent number of interesting decisions throughout. There is just that feeling that it could have been a little better if a little more effort was put into the components but it's certainly a game I like in my collection.

RATING: 8
Hansa is a deceivingly simple game where, like in most other euro games, money is exchanged for goods which are exhanged for victory points. However, this economy is full of agonizing decisions.

1. Where do I move the ship to give me the best options without giving the next player good options?
2. Which goods color do I collect to get as many victory points as possible while minimizing the risk that another player exchanges that color before me?
3. Which goods do I exchange for shops (more money and geographical options) and which goods do I exchange for victory points now?
4. Which shops do I keep for area majority victory points and which shops do I spend for exchanged goods victory points?
5. How much money and goods do I spend this turn and how much do I save for the next turn?
6. When is the right time to replenish the goods on the board?

The luck dimension of having the right resources available at the right time and place may be greater than in Michael Schacht's China but both games are true master pieces when it comes to simple yet deep games.

RATING: 7.5
Overall Comment: Hansa is a game with few rules that requires the players to get what they want and then to try and setup the next player so that it is harder for them to achieve a goal.

Ratings:
Initial(wow factor): 6 (dull board design that could have used a few more colors on the pallet, the bits are small disks except for the boat and the goods are rather plain barrels)
Family: 7 (the quick play is key but it does not appeal to all)
Game Group: N/A
AP effect: 8 (decisions are light but with more players it does slow down a bit)
SoloPlay: Not yet designed

When Purchased: 2008
Recommended expansions: Yes, but don't need to be purchased.  Significantly improves replayability.
Age range: 10+

Reason purchased: Geek analysis and price point, something different

Pros: the game plays quick and there are multiple paths to victory.  The ability to replenish and then take advantage can give the game a come from behind aspect.
Cons: the replenishment draw adds a luck factor that can tilt the game at a critical moment (last turn), the game concept is abstract and the board design is drab

Recommendation: it is a game that for a good price is a good addition to your game library. It is light enough to play for the new players and thought provoking enough for the experienced.  It is a good filler game that will play in less than an hour.
Replay rating: below average (the "expansion" ideas, rule changes, help to mix up the paths to victory)
Game value: (play/cost ratio): average due to the low cost of purchase.

In the Baltic Sea with 9 cities, players attempt to sell goods, move the ship, put down warehouses or buy goods, but the trick is that you only get 1 action at a city. Seems to play better with 3 players than 4 players since the board doesn't change significantly as much after your turn. The mechanics are clean and it is easy to play.

RATING: 6.8
Light tactic game that boasts lots of possibilities for all the players in their turns. In truth, most of the times there's at least 1 or 2 evident actions you should do. Overall, the games advances fast enough and the duration is perfect (you do the same turn after turn, you definitly don't want the game to last any longer than it actually does).

Even so, the time between turns feels a bit long, since you can't plan inm advance (you never know where the boat will end).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Works 2 to 4 players. Having only 2 players there is naturally more control over the game. The game actually has good flow with 2 players. There is no hidden information (except what new tiles will come if you replenish) on your own turn so you can calculate that turn perfectly. There is luck of draw with tiles so that it is not too calculable overall. With 4 there is maybe a bit too much chaos. It's still very much playable and fun. Three players seems to be how I like this most. There is some added chaos and interaction from third player. Rules are a bit unintuitive but after you've played for a while they're clear.

Grafica e materiali fanno sembrare il gioco più vecchio di quello che è; le dinamiche sono un po' ripetitive e poco coinvolgenti ma il gioco è molto strategico con una buona interazione e necessita di capacità di programmazione. La risoluzione migliore penso che sia in 3 giocatori; in 4 aumentano i tempi morti. Freddino ma profondo.

RATING: 7
A great, and surprisingly intuitive, economical game; nowhere near as dry as the cover art and theme might suggest. Apart from some fiddly limitation rules, there's much to love here, from the unusual map location to the clever ways the market is balanced. The elegant mechanics (and, yes, cliche-haters - they really are elegant) are a dream, but they run heavily on downtime if you're not careful.

RATING: 7
Your results are a bit too dependent on where the previous player leaves you, and the game is too tactical, the downtime too pure, to ever be a favourite. It's certainly solid and your turns are interesting when they come around. The usual play is to convert all of your initial tokens into majorities in cities so as to get free tokens in future, hopefully in a pattern that won't be too costly to get to. Then hope that high valued tiles come out on your cities and the player before you isn't too mean when determining your starting spot each turn. At 45-60 minutes it's too long for what it brings to the table, but it's good for the occasional tactical burner every now and then.

Update 9/08. I'm back into it. Really limited money and actions forces an almost "relaxed" posture. Keying into who's playing and trying to determine if will they refresh or not...

Great as a 2 player game. I've played it at higher player counts and have decided I will only play this 2 player going forward.  Very fast set up and gameplay that is very fluid and light on rules.

This game really presents some interesting choices between establishing ports and cashing in on goods.  There's also a great balance between doing everything you can during the current turn, and trying to save for later.

Sweet, simple little trading game. Love the look, the price, the mechanics. Has room for messing with your neighbor, cool hidden victory points which keeps analysis paralysis down too. Perfect little game. Perfect for under 60 minutes between majors on a game night. Or a nice finisher after a deeper session. Purchased 2nd copy as a gift for friend, sadly he's not apparently played it in over a year. Geekbuddies kill this (5.43), but with a huge variance (3 to several 8's). Cleary a taste issue, I love this type of game.

Oct 2014: I put this game solidly in the "German Game" camp. I can rarely get anyone I play games with to get excited about these kinds of games any more. (It was hard even back in the day when German-style games were the rage).

Played a few games of this with my friend Kevin before he moved away to Colorado. Oddly, I got beat down badly the two-three times we played, and it kind of soured me on this game. Kevin clearly picked up on something in the play that I just totally am missing. Maybe if I could figure out what it is, we would neutralize each other and the game would come down to whomever makes the first mistake.

Meh - that's not a formula I like that much.

"Solid" as everyone says. It's true, mechanics are perfect. But at a first glance it seems also very COLD, more than a Knizia game could be; mechanics work perfectly, interaction is high and luck seems well managed, but the feeling completely lacks! Materials are not very good and the box is awful, but this goes with the price, that is rather cheap. Although production did not put separations in the box to put all the different discs and pieces, spent money and players energy to make useless objects: the money bag is totally useless and the five piles on the board have the only objective of warning of the latest turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Quite an interesting mechanic: players share a boat sailing from city to city. It feels weird, but true, brings interaction! Since because of taxations you are limited to 3 coins/commodities after your turn is over, it is quite clever way to force players to progress the ship somehow (nobody wants his money to be wasted..!).

The game was ok, and that was it. A bit of a logistics in it, but basically the idea is just to use your money most effectively. Kicking other players is also possible: sell same colour of goods as somebody else has in his/her ship -> that good must be dumped. Whee.

This wasn't a repelling experience but something was missing. It was too much of the same thing throughout the game and didn't wake my interest up too much.

Saw my friend do it to us...  Great with 2 people also.

Not for the AP prone. Downtime between turns is a drawback to this game for me.

I also found the game fun. In some sense, it's *a little* "mathy", but not overwhelmingly so. You might find that you try to work out if you have enough funds to do one or two things on your turn. Still fun with the right crowd. For a serious Euro fan, there's probably a permanent place for it in your collection.

Interesting economic type game with some clever consequences to consider such as getting extra actions and utilising the trade winds around Scandinavia. Watch out for the potential loss of vps if someone sells like goods. You have at least 3 actions per turn, with the potential to get more with wise spending & judicious market placement and even with the minimum and a reasonable menu of options, there is inevitably downtime even with 2. Hence I can't play with more, and the above rating is for online play with 2, as this is the best medium for a game which requires some short term strategy, taking into account how many actions your opponent will have next.

A bit dry thematically, but a fun game, good for 2 or 3 players. I like the mild screwage, and the mechanic of trading and competing for markets while your movement is dependent on the boat's location.

Hansa seems like a decent game, though we probably shouldn't have played it with four new players, one of whom suffered badly from AP. It does seem highly tactical, especially with more players as the board changes so much between your turns. I've also tried a couple of two-player games against the AI and it absolutely crushed me, so there is clearly some skill to the game that I haven't acquired yet!

UPDATE: much better with 2p! Definitely tactical, but very clever.

Bland board but a good game of action optimization.  The preceding player's style can have a large impact.  Variable turn order might make a good house rule.

I thought the game was fine and liked the challenge of determining how many cities to move or how many markets to drop. However, the group hated it along with most of Michael Schacht's stuff. Its long gone the way of the math trade.

This is an EXCELLENT 2-player game! Very simple rules with lots of strategic and tactical options each turn. Screwage, bluff, and co-operation are all possible. Quite short and plays fast. Maybe a bit better with 3 (more interaction) and a bit poorer with 4 (the board seems too small and the game actually becomes too short).

RATING: 7
(rating based on 2-player games only) I was skeptical that this simple game would not offer enough strategy to be entertaining, but even after multiple plays I find it an engaging and enjoyable experience, and just short enough to avoid repetitiveness. The internal logic built around assembling the most profitable routes to transport goods, while simultaneously fouling up your opponent's, holds up well. A pleasant game with good internal consistency.

Don't think I ever played a game as incorrectly as Hansa first time around. Typical Schact game; simple rules, very accessible and a bit to think about. Not quite enough tough decision making here though and the game mechanics are repetative. Doesn't feel like you can do enough to stop other players (apart from moving the ship).

Another boardgame from Schacht. The theme is about the Hansa traders of the Baltic Sea. Basically you move the ship from city to city, buy and sell goods and at the same time establish trading posts. Selling goods gives victory points and monopolies are worth their while too. The game plays nicely with two to four players and does not take too long either. Theme is there, but some can find the game to be a bit in the dry end.

This didn't look like much, but turned out to be a pleasant surprise. My first game had 2 players only, and boy, it looks like it could be an EXCELLENT tactical game for two. The intertwining systems for marketing and victory point collecting work seamlessly well, and the game is simple enough to let you marvel at its cleverness by your first game's end. Not everything Michael Schacht does is great, but when he hits the mark, he does it flawlessly.

(+) Clever use of a singular mechanism for obtaining income (the boat) to create a shared incentive.  
(+) Elegantly-designed pick-up-and-delivery mechanisms truly allow for this to be simply pleasant to play.  
(+) Innovative resupply mechanism gives a gleeful feeling when you are allowed first pick amongst the new goods.  

(-) Gameplay is about as dry as it gets.  
(-) Randomness can yield an unbalanced distribution of goods.  
(-) Feels somewhat constricting to only move a singular direction, which limits gameplay.*

*Pondering if the expansion's rule variant that allows you to perform reverse movement (at double the cost) is a necessity to enjoy a more dynamic, strategic experience.

A tactical game that can be played quickly.  Works nicely as a 2, 3 or 4 player game.  Optimal play depends not only on gaining one's points, but limiting the options of the next player.  It is this balancing act that makes moves not as obvious as others might suggest.  (If moves are "obvious" - should be able to look ahead 2 or 3 moves and plan your opponents moves also.)  The only random factor in the game is the goods distribution at the cities.

----------

I think that the tactics are pretty interesting:  sacrifice VPs for market majority, control profitable loops, leave your opponents in poor position... it's a tactical game.  And by tactical... I mean ridiculously tactical; there is no long-term strategy to be had in this game.  

Hansa isn't very deep (although, for a short game, it does have some meatiness to it), and I question its replayability due to the static loops and limited viable strategies.  Also, I think the sweet spot for this game is 2 players, and anything more than 3 would make people lose too much control.  

Components are fantastic for such a cheap game, and everything looks really nice together.  

----------
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Hansa is a neat little pick up and deliver game that seems to get a bad rap as being a "soulless" and "dry" euro. I don't think either of these are necessarily the case, because it should be based on its merits as a 30-45 minute filler. As such, it's pretty dang meaty. It's very functional, as turns are tight, and early mistakes can be unforgiving. I rather enjoy the mechanics of what's there. That being said, I have some initial problems with it after my first play.

I read a comment about this game claiming, that in a four player game, "one player always gets hosed." I think I was that one player. Multiple times throughout the game I was faced with: Poor option 1, an even poorer option 2, and replenishing the board, while other players were set up magnificently for a strong turn. I have a suspicion that in a four player game, one player can get caught in a vicious cycle of screwage that is difficult to climb out of without consorting with the player on your left. I'm not sure how I feel about a game where your success or failure is directly influenced by whomever is sitting on your right.

I'd like to give the four player game a few more tries to see if my suspicions are unfounded (they may well be). It seems like it truly shines as a 2-3 player game, because right now, the 4 player game appears too random/chaotic for my taste. tentative rating of a 6 that may go up.

My suspicion is confirmed after a three player game, seemed to play much better with this number. Slight rating bump.

A typical Schacht: Simple rules, but an involved tactical game.

Money as Action Points which can be saved for later is brilliant; there's never enough, you always want to do more. Nice resource management aspect, as well as a neat screw the others factor (selling goods).

On the downside, maybe a bit dry and silent. And a bit counter-intutive at first. Also a trademark of Schacht.

Takes 40-60 minutes (2-4 players), no fear of analysis paralysis (at least in our group) since there's (on average) only three actions and relatively few, simple choices to be made.

Altough COMPLETELY different from Puerto Rico as far as mechanics are concerned, it does have a somewhat similar feel to me... just imagine Puerto Rico with a shipping phase a la Hansa. It would've been perfect!  


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I love the dynamic where everything in the game has multiple uses. You need money to move but also to buy goods. You need goods to set up markets and to score victory points. You need markets to sell goods, score victory points, and hopefully get additional income or cheap goods. It's always an agonizing decision about whether to sell goods or set up markets. Setting up markets can benefit you but if you never sell, you will not win. The game also works great with 2 players.

Nice trading game that I'd write a longer comment here about except my comments for this game keep on disappearing from the database. Copy from Überplay arrived without any ship or markets - no wooden pieces at all. Update - pieces eventually mailed to a US address and then passed onto me.

After further play this has really cemented a place in my collection. For what is a rather dry game there's enough choices on your turn to keep you 100% engaged throughout. The system is very clever, simple, smooth and with the alternative board (and scoring tweak), it'll keep you coming back for more. I'd be first in line to pick up a reprint with a double sided board. An excellent streamlined game.

It's a refreshing idea that every item in the game serves as an individual currency for a certain action. Money for movement and buying goods, goods for placing markets and markets for selling goods.I know no other game that in such a creative way combines all the elements of the game. 

Drawback of the game are the arrows on the map. After a few plays it feels like going round in circles. 
The game has a low replayability rate. And when urged to go trough the rules every once in a while ... Other games make it more often to the table.

RATING: 5
Clever design, but more an exercise in mechanisms than a true game since it's so bone-ass dry. Build stalls with an eye on both proliferation and majority, and go around picking up sets. Hard to decide when to shift gears back and forth.

2-player is especially cut-throat because of the zero-sum nature of giving actions away. It can sometimes be beneficial to just park the merchant ship near your cities and do nothing.

I really expect this rating to go up as I get a little better at the game.  It seems as though it will become even more of a puzzle solving game as I get better at it.  Still, the whole economic system--being able to perform only one action per port is interesting and can require some careful planning.  In addition, the use of barrels as victory points and to set up markets--so you can get victory points and hopefully some money--sets up a very interesting tension.

Hansa -- 

Played twice; three- and four-player.  Very strong mechanic. 

I began my first play without understanding the game (other players had played; I had not), so I placed my pieces poorly, which led to an unbalanced game. Curious to see if another play will improve my opinion. The art is very appropriate to the theme.

[i]Update 26 Sep 2009:[/i]  Finally played again.  It is very important to understand the flow of the trade routes and to place markets to take advantage of that flow.  I've increased my rating to a 7, now that I know that the balance issues can be overcome.

There's something about Hansa that appeals to me.  Have to play it more to see if I can clarify exactly what that something is.

RATING: 6.5
Game of trading in the Baltic sea during the Hanseatic League times with some clever mechanics. Unfortunately it suffers from being AP prone, as there isn't much you can do during your opponents turn and sometimes the player needs to take a bit time for counting the possible moves in order to check whether he has enough money to perform the desired actions. What helped was that naturally players try to convince the active player that the best choice is to buy the goods from the city where they have the stall majority, which established atmosphere of funny bragging during our games.
So far played only with 4p.

Played once with 3P. A light pick-up-and-deliver game which requires players to juggle between managing money, setting up trading posts and buying goods. Players obtain VP by selling off sets of goods of the same colour. Money doubles up as action points and can be a source of some downtime as players figure how to spend their money efficiently in a given turn.

There is also a little luck involved as players don't know what is the goods distribution like until they pay for the board to be replenished. Hansa is mostly tactical and abstract, but there is a certain charm in how it generates some tricky decisions out of a simple ruleset.

[10 plays] Have yet to play with 4 players. My only criticism is the weak theme, goods should be "cloth, salt, etc." instead of generic barrels, one-way trade routes are a bit contrived, and despite all of this - I always enjoy this game. 

The map is beautiful, the rules are simple, and the tactical options are fun. The mechanic for booth placement and booth loss when selling goods is clever. Everything works well. It is an excellent abstract game.

Update: Have tried the Changing Winds variant twice now on MbW and I thought it was great.

RATING: 6
A very able trading game but untimately, rather dry rinse and repeat feel to it.

The board features 9 cities in the Scandinavian region and players use their money (essentially action points) to move around, build markets, pick up and sell goods.

Th market mechanism is built into the markets around the board and players who start seeding their own marketplace early on (at the expense of early goods trading) will do well. 

Also, place the ship in an inconvenient city for the next player and watch him/her curse.

Nice simple mechanics, but several possibilities.  Nice weight to it.  Hard to plan ahead because you are not sure where the ship will end up on a turn, so can be prone to some analysis paralysis as one looks at the new position, but I like how you have to balance having markets in cities, scoring points and getting superiority in key spots for extra cash.  Nice game and I am keen to play it again.

The gameplay is great and the art is wonderful.  However, while the theme definitely works, there's no real hook here that makes it stand out.  I don't really mind.

Hansa is a nicely produced game with clear and intuitive rules. I kind of liked my first few plays, but now have no desire to play. Unfortunately, the game is just over-programmed for my taste. Many folks compain that Schacht's games are dry, but Hansa doesn't feel dry to me. It is simply too constrained for me. Hansa provides no opportunity to develop a rich strategy, and the tactically optimal moves are fairly transparent. Yes, it's a tight game, but that doesn't make it good. Plenty of tedious games are tight.

Having never been a fan of Michael Schacht's designs, I was pleasantly surprised by the level of enjoyment I was getting out of this game.   This game's basic mechanics in some respects plays almost like pool.   The with every move you plan not only to help yourself, but to leave the boat in a position where it won't aid the next player.

The system of accumulating action points works well. I like how everything is a commodity for something else.

Plus, the board is pretty (and slick, you could play shuffleboard on it) with great components.

Interesting game, played twice with two, and once with three.  Its an abstract that doesn't look so abstract.  Since I've only played it a couple of times, I still feel like I'm making sub-optimal plays, and there always feels like there's so much more I want to do on my turn.

RATING: 6
I'm not a huge Schacht fan because of his disconnect between theme and gameplay. Although I think Hansa is very clever, the gameplay has no basis in reality. Once again, what is a "coin" and why would a person be able to spend one to refill markets? Why can you only move in the set directions? Why do you give up market booths to sell goods? It's all very clever but in this case (as opposed to Zooloretto), the fun of the game does not overcome the disconnect.

Straightforward economic game, where you try to collect goods.  The rules weren't taught very well to me, and it made for a frustrating play, since I felt lost most of the game.  I'd have to try it again, and maybe bump up the rating.

UPDATE: Now having played while knowing the rules (sort of), this is a fun and fast game. I enjoy the pick-up-and-deliver mechanic, as well as trying to vary the size of your turn by occasionally banking some money or spending it all to make solid progress.

Many plays, mostly online (game now at http://www.michaelschacht.net/pbm/).

A nice, fast game of tactical play - move the boat to earn the most you can (depends on where the boat is on your turn) and don't leave it somewhere where the next player can get a lot of free stuff. The trading theme is a bit awkward, as you don't actually trade anything. But it works as an economic/set-collection game. Nice twist that you need to sell goods for VP, but trade them in to set up market stalls (which you need in order to sell goods)!

Probably best with 2, although there is a first-player advantage. With 3, and especially 4 players, I think the last player will have a hard time catching up.

Hansa is a pretty good game, possibly one of Schacht's best. That's not saying much, as I'm not a huge fan of his designs. Hansa is your typical short, tactical euro. I might rate this higher, but for some reason, I hardly ever think of this game when I want to play something short and tactical. I nearly always end up with a game by Knizia when I do. And as far as Schacht's games are concerned, I'd rather play China/Web of Power.
Close, but no cigar.

RATING: 8
The factors in play are simple, but original and engaging.  Everybody goes around the board picking up and delivering goods, but everybody goes in the same ship! Wherever the last player leaves the ship is where the next player starts. A very clever framework is built around this. To cash in your points you have to leave markers behind as "markets," where you'll have a chance to turn goods in for victory points when the trade routes bring you back around (and around and around). Other stuff happens. Goods get replenished. Game-ending condition gets targeted. Etc. Planning and precision reap their rewards. Board artwork pleases the eye. What's not to like?

[2 plays] Initial reaction rating.  Played this game twice in a row.  The first game of mostly a feeling out of the rules, one player caught on to the importance of early market stalls early and dominated. The second game was a lot tigher.  It is an okay game, the rules are easy it requires some good thinking, and has a good pace and total play time.  However, the I didn't like the randomness of how the good come out.  The difference between a 1 good and 3 good is a lot.  Some player might just be randomly gifted into a great turn, and other might get nothing useful.  Also the game is very reactionary.  I really didn't feel like I can plan ahead, I almost have to wait right until it is my turn, see where the ship ends up to start thinking of what my best move is.  After playing twice I would say fairly average, maybe slightly above average game.

Hansa is more akin to an abstract game.  The theme means absolutely zero to the play.  It massages the brain muscles a bit (or a lot).  There is no luck and most moves are critical to your success.  I find it interesting to isolate your opponent and force her to pay you for goods.  We always forget to use the "losses" rule and I'm sure that changes gameplay quite a bit.  My wife finds it boring and it kind of is in a relaxing way.

update : Finally use losses in the game.  Better understanding of the flow.  Still a now and then game.

I like some of the mechanics, like the movement but others felt so awkward. I couldnt understand what I was doing building a market or whatever it was. Was it a stall I was renting? or actually creating consumer awareness? Like a lot of german games there are a number of tacked on abstract mechanics that kill the historical feel and kill any sort of classic abstract. The fact that an economic game gets its best reviews when played a a two player should tell us something. I am not sure what, but that sure is odd.

tl;dr: elegant

How cool is this? A trading game in which there is only one pawn for all players combined. The position where you end your turn directly influences what options the next player has. Now this means the amount of planning you can do ahead of time is limited of course, but that's not really an issue here as the options are also limited: move, buy goods, convert into points or build a trading post. This game does quite a bit with very few rules and components. Just as one would expect from Schacht of course. The result is a very tight and pretty tense game that feels neither too heavy nor too light.
Very efficient and elegant.

Rating after one game.  I think BGG's description of the "5" rating sums this one up: "Average game, slightly boring, take it or leave it."  Very dry and unintuitive.  There is definitely some strategy there, but not enough fun to justify playing it.  If I ever forced myself to play this again, my rating would probably go up, since a lot of the game was spent trying to figure out how the hell to work the thing, but I don't see this game making it to the table again.

For its weight, it's quite enjoyable (I miss medium-weight games!).

UPDATE: After a second game with two, my feelings are very similar. That said, I'm starting to worry that two is not the ideal player count. I anticipate the game will start to lose some of its dynamism. I'd like to try with more.

Now that I have played this also with three players I can say the game is simply too short. You have to acquire goods hastily, turn them into markets and victory points and then it's over before you even know it. Maybe that's the way it's meant to be but it seems that (if played "correct") in a third player game the turn of one player always starts from the most actionless corner of the board where the previous player left him, again. I also fear this game starts to repeat itself too quickly because of limited options and very small gameboard. But that remains to be seen. Edit: My third play with three players again was considerably better. I might have been wrong. Raised the rating.

A friend told me he got a new game and it was Hansa. Played it two or three times the first night and had a lot of fun. fairly easy rules,with little to no need to refer back during the game. We found the game got better when we went from 2 players to 3 and the 4.

Not a bad game, but it seems to lack the depth of some other similarly weighted/timed games such as Yspahan and Mykerinos (although it is also very different from those two).  I enjoyed my first play, but if given a choice, would rather play one of the aforementioned games.

Good with two players. Unfortunately the box and game have a dull look to them, so this one doesn't beg to be played as much as some other games. But still a fun pick-up-and-deliver game to play from time to time.

Update: Increasing my rating to an 8. I don't play this very much because of the dull box and board, but every time I play it I have a lot of fun.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 2-3[/b]
With more players you're not able to plan ahead because the boat could move too much between your turns.

RATING: 7.5
Very tactical. There is some planning with two players and really that is the ideal player count.

With 3-4 all strategic planning goes out the window and it is purely tactical which combined with the limited choices one is left feeling that there are few meaty choices. 

The good news is that even with fewer opportunities to make clever moves the game plays quickly enough that it is entertaining.

Update: Rating moves down from 8 to 7.5. More a function of having played so many games I have become much more selective than when I rated some of my games a few years ago. 




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 2
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

Another classic Michael Schacht game - streamlined design, with just a few types of actions, but with plenty of choices within that context.  Nice components and a good looking board seal the deal (I'm a sucker for German maps and historical contexts).

I've raised my rating twice now. This game, like Michael Schact's Web of Power, packs a lot of game in a short (under an hour) amount of time. A bit dry, but it's light enough and short enough that the lack of a strong thematic element doesn't bother me.

RATING: 7
Need more plays of this one to be certain, as the person with whom I first played the game didn't quite take to it.  Nonetheless, while it does lack the hook other games may have for non-gamers--I'm not sure why--I think it is fun and think it holds its fair share of bitterly contested matches.  Feels like you get quite a bit of tactical decisions rammed into a pleasantly-short game length.

Another interesting Michael Schacht game.  Not too complicated, but enough going on to make it pretty interesting.  Looking forward to trying again sometime -- UPDATE: Played a few more times on MaBiWeb, and while I don't find this to be a particularly good 4-player game, I am really impressed with how it plays with only 2 players.  In fact, I've added it to my next order because it fills the niche of a middle-weight 2-player game very well.  As with Through the Desert or Samurai, this is a middle-weight euro that works fine with a group, but really shines with just two.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Neat little pickup and deliver with some strategy built in because you can only sail in certain directions, plus you want to make sure you're not caught with goods when someone else is selling.  So far, the winner of every game I've played in made a lot of points by being the only merchant in several cities, which is worth 4pts each.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Mechanics are interesting though not completely intuitive; the money for action-points bit is a really clever mechanism and one that adds some interactivity -- needed, because it's fairly limited. Chaotic, in the sense that a players turn is very sensitive to where the ship ends up, but very difficult to predict (at least in 4-player) where it will end up for you next time. One of the challenges is figuring out how to get other players to give you money for more actions later; as with many games, it's probably not good to appear to be an early leader.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Nice and simple game that results in a very nice game experience. A lot of decisions have to be made and the interesting part is that this decisions have to be based on the long run of getting points and not on the given situation that you are presented at the start of each of your turns. Great game!

This game is fantastic with the right crowd.  We call it the "screw you" game and for good reason.  Many laughs had by moving that stupid ship so, so far away from the next player.  I think this has more to do with the right crowd (Dan, that's you) than the game...

A pretty dry and abstract game, but nonetheless a nice tactical maximization excercise for two. Sometimes it can be pretty hard to choose between selling your goods for VPs or using them to increase the number of booths you have on the board. The length of the game is perfect with two, and turns are pretty quick. Components are a little boring but serve their purpose. Did not like it half as much with three as I like it with two. One of Schacht's best and most elegant designs. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really wanted to embrace Hansa. After the numerous positive reviews, my expectations were quite high.... and it fell with a thud after my first game play. With four players, the game quickly became tedious and dragged out. While the unidirectional ship movement promotes tactical play, with four, it is rather a mess. Ships are far away from the area of play and one cannot really predict or plan ahead since you have no idea which chips are left over and where the boat will be. This became frustrating for some. Plus, the replenishment of goods was also somewhat arbitary and all of us thought that the game dragged and one stack less of tiles would work better. I cannot give this game top billing nor can I give it a "4". A mediorcre game that is most likely better with 2 and less so with more players.

Clean, tight, highly-economic gameplay with tough choices and multiple strategies.  Actually a little TOO well-organized for my interest.  I like my gaming spiked with at least a LITTLE chaos, and Hansa is like the boardgame equivalent of papa-bear's bed...a little too stiff to relax in.

RATING: 7.5
This game plays deceptively fast.  You get to place market places on 3 cities.  Goods are spread out on a board on various cities.  You get 3 coin per turn which can be used to move the ship and buy goods.  When goods are purchased the money goes to to whoever has the most market places. If that's the purchaser then goods are free.  If there's a tie the coin goes to the banks.  When you have a pair of goods and you land on a city where you have a market place, you can use your market place to sell any goods you have 2 or more of.  You get victory points for goods sold and goods you have at the end.

RATING: 6.5
Fun little pick up and deliver game with a nasty twist - you need market booths on the map to efficiently buy and sell goods which turn into victory points, but you must use those same goods to set up the market booths in the first place. So effectively, you're spending the points you've already collected in order to try and get more points down the road.

Rated as a 2-player game.

(after 2 plays, 1 2p and 1 3p)  This is a dry thematic game, but it does fit the game play.   There are some interesting decisions throughout - buy goods, sell goods, refill markets and timing plays a big part as does efficiency. 

Think it might play better with 2, but good with 3 too.

First play - 4 players - Fun little game. Decision are decided mainly on what your opponents do before your turn but there are a lot of decisions to make. Strategy seemed to be to get markets out early, try to control the ports and ship when able. I found myself paying to refresh the tokens twice during the game, there is quite a bit of luck at that point hoping to get what you need and not leave mhat your opponents need out there. I look forward to my next play of this and I'm adding it to my wishlist as well. *second play* Going last isn't so bad. On the last play of the game I refreshed the tiles and scored some points without giving my oppoenents another turn. It was a wild game I won with the scores being 43-35-35-35. A 3-way tie for second! I raised my rating to a 9. I recently picked up a copy in a trade.

Michael Schacht; Pick up and deliver; Players are merchants of the Hanseatic League. Players take control of the ship and buy and sell goods, establish trading posts, and sail to find new markets. The board is a very simple map of Scandinavia, with arrows from point to point restricting where the boat is able to move. Active player takes control of boat and must pay to move to each new city where he may either buy, sell, or expand. Players want sets of goods that they can trade for victory points, but also need to expand market presence to generate revenue. Expanded by: Hansa - Changing Winds (and, previously, Hansa Extrakarte)

RATING: 7
My first impressions of the game were low.  I guess Herr Schacht spoiled me with Web of Power.  Then, I played a few games online, and started to see the shine through the game.  There are some tough choices, and a distinct way to read the board to play your best.  It gives me that "One more time!" feeling that's always good for a game.  There's plenty of turn angst in this game, and while it won't knock Web of Power off its pedestal, it's still fun and satisfying.

It's prone to over-analysis and until you get used to the moves you are permitted (this one costs you a coin, that one costs a goods marker, this other one requires that you remove a market stall), it can get bogged down in referring to the rulebook. Still, it's a good little game. It's a game where there is a lot of calculating of optimal moves, much like Attika or the Colovini games I've played.

A prime example of a game in which the player to your right will affect your ability to succeed in the game. With an inexperienced player in that position, you'll often find lots of barrels on a full board with the boat in an ideal spot; with a seasoned hand in that position, rotsa ruck.

As such, I prefer playing with only two, or with players of equal ability. If you're teaching someone new, go easy on them the first game or else you're likely to quadruple their score and have them veto the game in the future.

Alhambra is probably the best game Uberplay has released, but that was a proven SdJ winner when they picked it up. Of the new games that Uberplay has done this is my favorite. Nice length and it is a pick-up and delivery game that doesn't take hours (like the crayon rail games) and doesn't makes folks' brains catch fire the way Logistico seems to. A very nice game, bonus points to designer Michael Schacht for doing the board art as well.

UPDATE: Like a lot of games I own, after a while, a game sits on the shelf. I review my rating on it, based on my lack of plays over the years and my unwillingness to table it. However, after a revival of playing online, a ftf and many many games of Schachts Java app against his rather clever AI, I once again must admit this game is a keeper. Rating have gone up, and while it's not a classic or even a great game, it's a game I'm more than happy to retain in my collection.
UPDATE: 20 Feb '11. This game rates like a yoyo! It spent a long time sitting on my shelf for years unplayed. I even listed it several times in our groups game sales/trades with no takers. Then after getting it on the table again, I realised this game is a keeper. It's got a short playing time, there's enough ging on for it's weight to play with non gamers and gamers alike. It's a realitively small box, and it's quite fun. It's not my best game in my collection by a country mile, but certainly a nice mid weight game I'm happy to play whenever suggested, so my rating shifts back up from a 6 to a 7, where I suspect finally, that's where it'll stay!

As long as everyone "gets" it - the player to your left is your enemy - the gettin' is good.

Very good game on organizing and making long term plans. They seldom work out but you have to plan ahead anyway.

RATING: 6.5
Played a few times (with 3 or 4 players). Some interesting ideas, if not exciting ones, but the game can really suffer from a turn order problem, where the player on your right can be decisive in limiting your possible moves.

Rating is from a single game on MabiWeb.

Some very nice puzzles in planning each turn. Seems very tactical, but maybe more plays would show me different there.

It's fun and with interesting and diverse mechanics to win, but I think it's broken with 3 or more because the organization of turns, for me it's better with only two players.

Es divertido y con diversas e interesantes mecanicas para ganar, pero pienso que está roto con 3 o más jugadores por culpa de la organización de los turnos, para mí es mejor sólo con 2 jugadores.

Beautiful board and components and fairly inexpensive.  Quick setup for a game with so much depth.  Elegant design and mechanics.  You must play with 2 to get an idea of just how good this game is.

This is one that definitely needs more plays.  I know I made some mistakes, and hopefully wouldn't repeat my blunders.  After playing once, I have a little better feel for the reasons to do one action over another.  And I need to pay more attention to the goods supply and try to have money to replenish and take what I need.

I am a little concerned because during this play, the initial placement of market stalls seemed to be more critical than I had realized.  However, I know that each game will play differently, and I will have to see if certain ports always become power centers.

I know that my wife enjoyed playing because for 30 minutes or so after we finished she was still talking about the game and things she could have done differently.  For any game this automatically increases its rating!

Beautiful game all around (box art, board and the rule...) Now I'm kicking myself hard for my stupid long standing reluctance to play Mr. Schacht's games. (Had been considering they were dry and thinky, and turned out I was dead wrong. They are pretty much enjoyable.)

I bought this for my wife. I was looking for a good, but cheap, game which had a "pick up and deliver" mechanic. This was the one that was recomended to me. However it dosn't quite fit the bill, it is pick up, but the delivery side isn't what we meant by that. Still its a good game and we probably need to play it a bit more to get the feel for it.

Traded away in the 2011 Mid-year Math Trade.

I enjoyed my 5 playings, and have finally won a game. I struggled a bit with my options and being able to plan far enough in advance to set up good moves, and balance that with not setting the next player up for a great move. With practice and the right group, this could indeed be a wonderful light-to-moderate strategy game. [UPDATE] I've now got 10 plays under my belt, including a few online. It's an excellent 3 player game, with lots of tough decisions -- including knowing "when to say when" and stop your turn instead of giving into temptation to spend everything you've got.

RATING: 6.5
Have two full plays under my belt now. Definitely a solid game, with more of a tactical lean than strategic.  You really are limited by where the boat is left by the previous player, and a major source of screwage is moving the boat one step further down a one-way route just to mess up your opponent.  It feels a little on the bland side to me too.  I don't know if it's the theme or the minimal wow-factor but I doubt I'd be pulling this one out too often, if I owned it.  Something about the fixed static routes make the game seem like it would feel repetitive after numerous plays, too.  Just not as much variety as I tend to prefer.

Simple rules, little or no luck and hidden victory points make it just right.  I can't wait to play more.

There are some interesting decisions for sure, such as what good to pick up; whether to push your luck and grab another free item or play it safe by selling; where to end your turn so as not to benefit the next player.  However, I did not care for the amount of bookkeeping one has to do, and it is especially frustrating for those that simply cannot count straight for themselves the amount of money they've spent to make their moves.  A decent strategic game, just not very fun to play.

Another hit from Michael Schacht!  Wonderful tactics, quick turns, tough decisions...Schacht's become one of my favorite designers; Hansa just backs up what I already knew.  Update: I'm not as enamoured with Hansa as I used to be.  It seems as though the choices are somewhat obvious.  Don't get me wrong, I still like the game, but it doesn't do it for me like it used to.

Nice, tough decisions to make.  The first time I played, traversal of the niggly one-way paths was tricky to plan correctly, but that is very much a part of the game, and much of what makes it interesting to play.

Easy simple rules, not too many things to manage but this game rewards planning by screwing the next player.  Would be a great intro game for people who have not played  many euro style games.

Удачная не длинная европейская игра с не совсем логичной механикой. В общем и целом мы путешествуем на корабле и в городах продаём, покупаем товары, строим магазины или "реализуем" товар в победные очки. Хорошая степень соревновательности, понятный процесс и далеко не самая просчитываемая система однозначно относят игру в разряд хороших настолок.

Минусы - тусклое оформление, не самые логичные с точки зрения темы поступки, есть рандом, неявность лидера играют злую шутку с игроками, которые поглощены только личной выгодой.

Very strategic and fast. Could benefit from a more robust theme/flavor, but the board and the pieces are attractive. It has a nice simplicity to it. The interwoven ideas/mechanisms work very well.

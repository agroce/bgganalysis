Got to get back at the game! This is a stock game where laying single track sections (drawn by crayon) between cities and mines is the modus operandi. Dividends are paid based on these connections and bonuses to particular outlying sections bumps the end-game. Fantastic Winsome title.

A train game that seems to be about forming the right partnerships, spending the right amount on shares, and not leaving yourself with too little cash.  It's Wabash Cannonball's bigger brother, and I like it better for this: I found WC to be a little short and a little wild, where Pampas is much more predictable.

this rating would be quite a bit higher if I hadn't played wabash. this game isn't half as tight as I think it should be, there seems to be way too much money around. I don't see this game giving me anything over Wabash, while I see very well where wabash was improved over this. and with 3-5 times the playing time, I just don't see myself wishing to play this again, ever. veld railroads seemed balanced a lot more if I ever want a meatier wabash.

Fiddly scoring system (if you don't remember to update the score track after every move, you'll spend half the game recounting the value of the lines), an ugly map, and horrible components.  My first Crayon Rail game.  I grew up around trains and this doesn't feel like a 'train' game.

Okay game, but the auctions gave me a headache as a newbie.  It's hard to determine the value of shares.  In the end, I think you can expect the final value of shares to be $20-30 in addition to lots of income over the course of the game (e.g. shares purchased early might produce $100 in income over the course of the game).  This combined with the high cost of building track justifies paying fairly high prices (~$25) per share at the beginning.  Of course, if the railroad gets horrendously cut off or boxed in, then the final value of its shares will be lower... but this seems unlikely.  The double-track-builds are very expensive should be done only when necessary... over-use of double-builds is a sure-fire way to destroy the value of a railroad.  Much like Traumfabrik, I don't think it's a viable strategy to let your opponents buy a lot of shares and run low on cash... because you can never get far enough ahead to buy shares on the cheap.  **UPDATE: it is possible to hoard cash for rounds 1 + 2, then get shares on the cheap in a 5-er game provided that opponents deplete enough cash early.  In the 6-er game there's too much cash available to do this, though.**

(6/11/10 - after 2 plays)My opinion of Pampas is tainted by the fact the conditions under which I played my first two games were suboptimal. In the first case, we played three-handed. This seems quite obviously to be the game’s worst player count. There were too many opportunities to NOT work together, especially since Kim got almost all the Norte shares and just ran rampant. In the second game, we played right after a pretty grueling game of Preussische Ostbahn so my brain was fried and I was low on enthusiasm for doing the math and figuring where the alliances were going to work. Also, we played on the original Winsome map which I find a bit difficult to process. Our last several dividends were played a lot more haphazardly than is fair to the game. That said, in retrospect, I think I really like Pampas. Four players was a very good number. The alliances were interesting indeed. I finally appreciated the expansion control rules in relation to how they influence partnerships and consequently issuance decisions. Each split has its own character (1/1, 2/1, 1/1/1, 2/2, 2/1/1, 3/2, etc.). Figuring out how that split character interacts with the other players’ holdings to create the right incentives just really floats my boat. Without dilution and minority ownership sabotage possibilities, the game seems quite a bit less volatile than Chicago Express, and aggression, while certainly there, has a lot less edge. I think I like way things evolve a bit more slowly here than CE with more emphasis placed on the share distribution and, because of the lack of the null action option, less on turn fiddling. The arc is more conducive to the type of alliance play I enjoy. Will this kill CE for me?

RATING: 9.5
Amazingly good.  A game of alliances, cooperation and shared rewards.  In many ways this is a game of arranging for other players to help you win.  This is a perfect and complete information information game outside of initial seating order and shared incentive structures are everything.  Two players working together can help each other far faster over the other players than the same two players working on their own behalf.  Incentives incentives incentives!

This is Wabash Cannonball with the reins let out and out on a good stretch.  It is a longer game than Wabash Cannonball, but in some ways a more subtle and conniving one than Wabash Cannonball.  In other ways Wabash Cannonball is the ultra-refined and condensed version of Pampas Railroads in the hands of a brilliant game developer. But those rough edges in Pampas Railroads are also attractive and have their own rough charm.  Brutally indelicate in character, unforgiving of even small errors and amazingly generous toward careful play.  Pampas Railroads is a game that allows players to be mean to each other in very pleasant and helpful ways.

The butterfly effect is present but is also not as fragilely unstable as it is in Wabash Cannonball.  Poor players should give away the game less often in Pampas Railroads.  Unlike Wabash Cannonball, good players should be able to win consistently in Pampas Railroads despite poor players in the game.

Currently rated at 9.  May still rise to 9.5.

I'm mostly convinced: This is a considerably better game than Age of Steam.  I haven't yet reflected that in the rating -- I'm awaiting more plays before I do that.  Compared to Age of Steam the knives are sharper and longer, the choices more difficult, the game more indirect, the butterfly effect is larger and yet more predictable and it has all the glorious benefits of being a certain and perfect information game.

Pampas (II) is all about tightening thumbscrews: there are 6 companies and 5 shares available for each. Players invest in those companies, and then use the company money to lay track to increase the company value, and so on. The core action in the game is driven by limited actions though. On one's turn one can either lay track, develop an area (i.e.: open a gold mine to increase its value to the rail company connected) or offer another stock up for sale. These options are all shown on cards, and are in limited supply. Once all of 2 of the 3 stacks have been exhausted a dividend payout round is triggered.

The decisions about what companies to invest in, who to work with, and how to best make a profit are all very tricky here because of the limited amount of time and actions available. 2 players cooperating as co-chairmen of a company will absolutely ream singular operators working alone just because they can invest twice as many actions in that singular company if they so desire. The map on Pampas II also is delightful for all the races that it creates at different times in the game. The availability of lines in the centre of the board seemed to stay until the late game, but the paths to gold, docks, and foreign terminals dried up quickly as races developed almost every round. 

The unique facet of this vs. the other games in the series is the limited action card pool, and IMO, this is the best game in the series by a nose over Veld Railroads (i.e.: Veld II), mainly because it is cleaner (not nearly as much messy book-keeping) and because the limited action pool adds intrigue. While the system worked in the earlier iterations, and the consortium bidding idea was neat in concept (more than implementation), I think the streamlining of the rules and the use of company kitties, company control, and the like fit the overall system better. I do think the Veld II system of allowing players to trigger dividend payouts faster would benefit this game, but there's no clean way to do it with the existing action selection mechanism, and that is the only real blemish I can point out about this title.

For those who are familiar with Wabash Cannonball, this is basically a much heftier version of the game system with a different fundamental way of handling stock (i.e.: partnerships do not have the income detriment associated with them to offset the extra potential actions) and a longer playtime. I appreciate the added depth of Pampas, personally, though it does come with a playtime cost, I find that cost worth paying though. 

One thing that some people might find a downside is the run-away aspect; early income advantages can snowball, and because the game is 2 hours, some people can be looking at a rough 60 minutes if they are snaked hard enough in the early going. This sort of aspect doesn't bother me, but if it's an issue with some people in your group you might be better served by the shorter South African Railroads (which is similar to Pampas, just much shorter) or games from the Wabash Cannonball lineage.

Pampas Railroads manages to improve on the excellent Prairie Railroads because of an improved action system that gives the players more control.  It's a very calculational investment game motivated by a severe shortage of time as well as a devious tension between cooperation and competition.  18xx players will find a lot to like in this game.

I have really enjoyed a number of Winsome games, and this is no exception. The components are austere, and the focus is always on the gameplay. This game's turn mechanism seems to be the precursor of Henry Wu's Chicago Express turn dials, except here it is represented by action cards. Due to the board layout, there seem to be more choices presented than in Chicago Express, which seems to lend itself to scripted play. I haven't played enough to notice if that is the case with Pampas, but on an intuitive level, I'd prefer Pampas over CE. My initial rating is '9'. Too bad it is OOP, but hope springs eternal for a reprint.

Update (02/18/12) 2 plays: Finally, managed to snag a reprint. 5-player game, with several newbies, took 3 hours. The general consensus is that 4 is probably the sweet spot--in a 5 or 6 player, we can imagine that one person could get screwed. Like other Winsome games (e.g., Chicago Express, German Railways), the stock auctions are the heart of the game, but calculating the intrinsic value and managing correct bidding is very challenging. Someone getting an early lead in income due to poor play of others, and you can usually call it there. This is going to take some time to figure out, as mistakes can be costly early on. Still, looking forward to more games.

Update (11/17/2013) 3 plays: 4-player game, with one newbie, took 3.5 hours. The game play is unavoidably similar to Chicago Express, and as such, is fragile and equally unforgiving, but taking a longer time to realize the outcome. One or two mistakes, as individuals or as a group, could give an early lead in income. In CE, the outcome can be quickly discerned within a turn or two, but in Pampas, the economic snowball is glacial at first, then accelerating. It is perhaps an hour in to realize that one has no chance at winning, and then another 90 minutes of helping someone else win, just to get second. Breaking away from the pack, once a mistake is made is relatively easy. However, as a group, it is difficult to discern how to rein in the runaway leader issue, other than downright collusion. But then, that may create a new leader! On the other hand, it also is the leader's game to lose, as a poor bid can quickly erase any gains. It is definitely not a game for the feint of heart, for it is like playing with broken glass, and requires many plays to figure this one out. There is no doubt it is a very good design, but not sure if I enjoy this type of game. For now, I'm dropping it to an '8', but still prefer this over CE on any given day.

Update (05/21/2016) 5 plays: 5-player game, took approximately 2 hours. As a group, we have been away from Pampas Railroads, so at least two of us immediately screwed up in bids for the initial railroads and overpaid (thinking we needed to sufficiently capitalize like in any 18XX game). It was clear that the person who preserved cash going into Turn 2 was going to win, as he started bidding and winning on stocks of various companies, while the rest of us did not have enough cash to compete. With the additional income coming in, there was no way to catch up. So, this game is extremely fragile, very easy to break with inexperienced players, and ruthless. After that, it is runaway leader, economic snowball that is no longer fun. It is a good design, but requires discernment--can't play this by intuition or by the seat of your pants. There is a very narrow window/margin of play where players can make minor mistakes and still recover. Go outside that band and the game breaks. Like Outpost, this is a game of chicken, playing carefully until someone makes a mistake, and then bam! Game over. No longer my kind of game. Dropping to an '6'.

This game has some very good things going in it.  There's limited action selection like I've seen in Wabash Cannonball, but in this game development is more useful than in WC so it's selected more often.  The set number of turns allows for shares to be evaluated for their worth rather closely, and in the end of the game you have the money to pay this value so profits are razor thin.

I like playing this one more than WC, and it has replaced it in my gaming line-up for the most part.

RATING: 6
The resemblance to Chicago Express is not only strong but impossible to miss.  However, I like CE much more.  For one thing, Pampas Railroads is quite a bit longer and has more shares per railroad, which decreases the tension considerably.  Second, it allows only the majority shareholder to build on a railroad, eliminating the rogue investor and decreasing the other players' motivation to begin an auction for a share.  This means there's a lot more improvement/rail building and less of the interesting jockeying for position in the shares.  (1 play)

This has bumped my Wabash rating down a bit. I'm fine with it taking 2 hours to play, and there's just a bit more of a game here than with Wabash.  It's a very fine line though, and both games are certainly excellent.  I follow the BGG guidelines of "desire to play" with my ratings.

Pampas Railroads is a game about jockeying for control of 6 different railroad companies.  Each company has 5 shares of stock with which to raise capital for their treasury.  Companies  can only spend from their treasury when building new track.  There are 9 "turns" which end in a dividend payout from each company based on the companies' current incomes.  

At the end of the game the only thing that matters is how much personal cash you have.  So you have to dump money into companies, and then milk them to get back more than you spent.  Meanwhile, every share that is sold is done via an auction, so other players have a chance to make sure that shares are sold at their true market value.  Shenanigans can occur by sandbagging your cash and/or turn-order to scoop up cheap shares when others don't have sufficient money to drive the price up.

This games uses the mechanic of having a limited number of actions for all players combined.  There are 3 capitalize (auction stock), 4 development (make cities worth more), and 5 expansion (build track) available per turn.  However, when any two types are depleted the turn ends and dividends are paid.  Paying attention to, and manipulating, this timing is important.

Which stocks you control, relative to your opponents, is very important.  If you have puppets doing your work for you, it's like getting actions for free.  Combinations of companies can become strong as well if they share links into cities.  This makes development especially strong when you control more stock-links* for a given city.

* A rough calculation of a company's links into a city multiplied by the number of shares you own in that company.  If you dominate your opponents in this value for a given city, then development is going to be strong.  This seems obvious, but it gets more interesting when you consider multilple players with a complex set of overlapping stock holdings.


== Comparison to Wabash Cannonball

Since it's likely that someone interested in Pampas has already played Wabash, here are some key differences.

* Pampas is longer.  2 hours versus 45 minutes.
* Each company has the same number of shares (5).
* Dividends are paid out as income / 5.
* The 9th dividend takes into account track laid as well as income and pays out "Wabash style" (divided by only the shares that have been sold).
* As a result of the above two, share value is easier to calculate in Pampas.  Stock dilution doesn't happen until the 9th round.
* Development is stronger in Pampas.  Income is counted for each node connection, rather than each node.  Because of this, when you develop a city you get an income bump for every link into the city.
* Companies can spend a lot more money in Pampas.  Track builds cost $5 for a single and $15 for a double.  Those 15's can plow through a treasury in a hurry.  The regional (off-board) locations cost even more.  Wabash players will probably undercapitalize companies in the first play.
* There are 4 special dividend triggers on the map, rather than one (Chicago).  These are claimed by a single company, rather than paid to each company which reaches the city.

This was an interesting game to try, but I couldn't grasp the path to victory. Most of the focus seemed to be on buying stocks in companies to gain money. There was too much playing psychologist trying to understand what the other players would do for my taste. I found it very difficult to place a value on any of the transactions. Also, the game seemed to run a bit long and I felt like it was almost impossible for me to catch up in the second half of the game. Still, I would like to try some more of these stock ownership games to see if I can get a better grasp on them.

Since I played Wabash first, I'll say that it basically is an extended play Wabash with a more powerful developing action.  As the game is exactly 9 rounds long, it also is more calculable as to figuring out potential worth of a railroad.  Turn order can play a large role in the game and that often is part of the decision making process as to what action to take.  Plays very well with 4.

RATING: 6
BGG user comments on this tend to emphasize that this is a longer version of Chicago Express.  If it were just that, and with the more interesting map that this has, I would like this game more than I do.

However, Pampas has three major differences from CE, none of them to my preferences:

1) Dividends do not dilute as new stock is sold.  Each stock cert pays 1/5th of income, no matter how many have been sold.  This takes away the main double-edged dagger of CE:  that stock sold helps you get a partner but also waters down the income you receive from dividends.  

2) In Pampas, only majority stockholders (or those tied for majority) may expand that railroad.  This takes away sabotage builds, where a company is expanded in a way that deters it from its destination or dilutes its treasury, another major double-edged-sword tactic from CE.  (1) and (2) taken together ensure that there is little need to defensively bid for your own company's stock to stop share dilution or sabotage builds.

3) CE's game length is variable and under the control of players.  Using "null actions" is a main tactic in lengthening the game, and targeting certain shares to be sold is the main way to shorten it.  Pampas will always last for 9 dividends, no more or less.  This gives the game a more staid and programmatic feel, and makes stock easier to valuate, especially as game end nears.

It's still a decent game, but I'd rather play Chicago Express twice in the time it takes to play Pampas, or do a single play of another investment game such as Imperial.

A very engaging rail game that rewards timing, smart buys and teamwork / collusion.  You simply won't win if you go at this one alone.  The action selection system works great and turn-order can be very important in this phase.  As in Wabash knowing when to put a stock certificate up for auction is very important.  Knowing when to let it go to someone else to save your money for another company can also be important.  The payment systems were unintuitive at first but they all start making sense as the game progresses.  I see a lot of this game in the many Winsome titles that followed it.

First impression (5 players): Yet another very plain looking Winsome train game. Here you get to draw routes on the game board. There are similarities to Wabash Cannonball that I liked but in the end this is longer and more analytical game. When offered in this form those aren't good characteristics for the game.

The combination of lots of open information and countability makes this game feel too analytical to my taste. Similar as in otherwise excellent Power Grid it starts to feel too much of a math exercise in your head. The length of the game is some sort of an issue too as 9 dividends ends the game but it starts to be a bit too repetitive till end and with very possible run away leader(s) problem it can be boring for some of the players. Also our game took 3,5 hours with some slow (and newbie) players so it's very possible that length of the game can be problematic. Even if played in two hours this might still feel a bit too long.

I don't typically like stock games, because I always feel like I'm helping other people with my actions more than myself.  This was worse than most, because of the long playtime, poor component quality, and the opacity of the scoring.  I was unable to tell who was winning or even doing well throughout the course of the game--while all of the information was open, it required a calculator to compute.  As such, bidding on stock was very difficult, because it was very hard to evaluate its worth.

My first game was a disaster (my fault: totally overvalued the first two dividends).  It's quite close to Wabash in style, but has a different enough feel (dividend style).  It was hard adjusting to the always divide income by 5 style of dividends.  Not sure if the "Value" aspect in the scoring helps much. The "crayons" made Liz happy to play, even if it isn't her style of game.

Like Wabash Cannonball, I think this is a masterpiece of game design!

While the premise is good and the early and mid-game play very well, the combination of AP that ensues at the end game and the outrageously pathetic components make a game that should rate a 7 or 8, only a 5 or 6. The dividend track component (sheet of light weight card stock) had some BGG forum posts printed on the back that were not related to the game (as in reuse of paper for commercial sale rather than recycle/clean first).

The upside:
-The perfect example of what a train game should be. You buy company shares, build connections between cities, develop those cities and you receive dividends.
-Also pefect: the playing time. You can knock yourself out leading your companies to where you want like if you owned them...
-Restricted action selection with consequences in dividend payout.

The downside:

Pampas Railroads is the very interesting older brother of Wabash Cannonball / Chicago Express. There's less emphasis on alliances and the economics are a little different with all 5 shares accounted for on dividends, whether sold or not.

--Apr2011-- This totally rocks; subtle, intriguing, interesting choices.  Very delightful game experience.  Reasonable possibility of being rated 9 with further play.

This is a great game having a lot of 
tension, and a surprising variety of 
strategy despite the simple mechanics.
It's probably best with five players so
that the five starting railroads are well capitalized.

It is hard not to see the foundations of this designs in many of the popular newer train games.  Really ahead of its time, and still compelling.  Many tough choices.  Fun stock elements.  Staying liquid is the key to this game.  I'm really into it.

Pampas plays like Wabash, with some differences:
- fixed 9-turn duration (vs. possible early end conditions)
- fixed network of connections (vs. hex map); crayon to draw on board (vs. cubes)
- once/game, everyone may take an unavailable (used up for the round) action again
- company income is based on each LINK (vs. each site): both sites on either end of the link give the company income. So in A-B-C, B counts twice!
- during the game, minimum bids and dividend payments for each share always = income / 5 (round up)
- the final (end of 9th round) dividend payment is different than the rest. It depends not only on income, but also on company VALUE (which is based on links and Regional Builds built on the board). Each share pays (income + $5/link + value of Regional Builds) / (# of shares outstanding) (round up).

I think I'm going to like this more than Wabash, but I hope to play it in 1.5-2 hours ... our first play (with Brian) took nearly 3 hours! There's more going on, more competition for links, and enough time to really develop things out.

Granted this is based on initial play but I think I like this better than Chicago Express.  The comment about WC/CE players undercapitalizing the first play was dead on. Second play:  While WC/CE is a great game, I feel this game has much more depth and is indeed a better game.

What a great game.  The opportunities for companies to grow and increase there values needs to be explored.  I really don't understand how to play this genre of game well, but it makes me want to come back for more.  I can also feel the similarity to Wabash, but it's enough different that I'm quite happy to own both.

Admittedly, we messed up a few rules when we played this for the first time. The fact that I still enjoyed it as much as I did, even with the errors, is a testament to the strength of the game. It is very similar to Chicago Express, but with key differences that give the players more time to realize their plans and recoup on their investments. The fact that each company has the same number of shares, and that there is no stock dilution significantly changes my strategy from Chicago Express because the auction action is less of an outright weapon. By far the biggest change for me, however, was the fixed game length. A primary skill in CE is managing when the game will end. Pampas requires you to plan for the long-term.

Overall, I enjoy the game, but miss the hard edge of Chicago Express. I would play again, and I would enjoy myself I'm sure. However, I'm happy to play occasionally rather than regularly.

Rating after one play.  Fragile with three players.  No catch up mechanism.  Rating could go up with more players.  I have to wonder if Wabash Cannonball doesn't do this one better...

At first I thought I liked this more than Chicago Express but in hindsight I'm not sure. The positives are that there's a greater sense that blocking others is possible (point-to-point map rather than hex), and that the value of a share seems more calculable due to the lack of dividend dilution (until game end) and the set number of dividend payouts.

That was all good except that it seemed to come to a point where everyone was rolling in sufficient money to pay up to exactly what a share was probably worth. People felt like it was not worth putting shares up for bidding unless their intention was to capitalize that railroad.

The game felt too long, like they were trying to make sure the whole map got built.

I delayed buying this until I could get the cube version, but that's a mixed bag. It's visually confusing as routes and developments are both marked with cubes.

Initial thoughts after one play.  For a game that has many similar mechanics as Wabash it sure does play differently.  It is a much longer game and the capitalization option doesn't seem to come up quite as often, especially early on.  I hadn't played a "crayon" (in our case dry erase) game before and I thought it might be annoying but it works quite well.  

Overall, for given that this is a much longer game than Wabash it didn't feel boring to me, the auctions keep you involved when it is not your turn and there are lots of options to think about.  It seemed like compared to Wabash there was much more of an element of cooperation between co-stock owners.

I would definitely like to try this one out again.

- side note - 
I don't mind the low key approach to bits they are perfectly functional - it seems like Winsome could go the Cheapass route and just have a bit packet that you could buy and then they could just sell the rules and maps (and any extra pieces necessary).

Without the mechanic of stock dilution, the tension in Pampas Railroads comes down solely to the decision as to which corporations to invest in.  One should realize immediately that there is little incentive to own a single company by himself.  Although you do want to end up with the majority in the most lucrative rail line, the importance of having a partner that can help in increasing its value should never be overlooked, because that will free up many of your actions elsewhere to widen the gap between you and your closest opponent.

The emphasis on cooperation in Pampas is as jarring as it is welcoming in my first exposure.  It is less subtle than Wabash, which I believe is the biggest reason why I find the former so much more enjoyable and fun to play as a result.  Unfortunately, the game isn't without flaws.  First of all, it is 2-3 rounds too long.  Towards the end of our session it was just a flurry of track expansions and developments to increase the final income, repeated several times over.  By then there were no good shares left, so it was painfully obvious who was in the lead as well as which rail line(s) not to extend to help him further.

Then there is the fact that with a known number of turns remaining, it becomes very easy for the more observant to determine the relative value of a stock up for bid (at least to a point where he can know how much to spend so he will still get a positive return for what he pays for it).  In comparison that kind of information isn't as readily available in Wabash, because the game could end at any time causing you to lose money in a recent investment.

My only other criticism is that Pampas does not seem to play well with 3 and I definitely would not recommend it.  I am however eager to try this again and am curious to see how the dynamic will change with the addition of more people.

I think this game is good, but the implementation is flawed. The means by which you start a piece and then slide straight down is always confusing to some -- and is largely unenforceable without the game becoming a little silly.

RATING: 7.1
This is a more intellectual version of the electronic game, Tetris.  The game has 4 boards therefore the game is divided into 4 rounds.

There are 3 phases in each round which includes inserting of a new game board.  Secondly, each player turn over a new starting card and position the first tile at the bottom of the game board.  Lastly, building tiles are turned over and all players are to place the same building tile onto the board.

After each round, points are calculated.  Each game board has its own special way of calculating points and at the end of the game, the player with most points wins the game.

Good points: The game is easy to learn and play.  The game should be interesting as people can compare the difference between the electronic and physical game.  Different game boards has different ways of scoring and it adds to the replayability of the game.

Bad points: The game seems to be a very individualistic game which there are very little interaction between players.  Players can only concentrate on building up their own points and hopes that the other players will not be better of then themselves.

RATING: 6.9
A very simple tetris-esque game of tile placement.  The difference between this game and tetris is that you cannot move your pieces left and right while dropping down the board; they must fall straight down. (also, the rows do not disappear when filled to completion)

Each time you play, you use the 4 different boards, which change the game slightly, showing certain spaces that must be covered up without significant points deducted, and certain spaces you want to leave uncovered for bonus points.  The different boards add a slight variety, but the game seems pretty static and grows dull fairly quickly.  With the right group, there can be a few laughs and some minor tension though.

Tetris board game done right.  Surprising to see Knizia's name on the box of a physically unique puzzle game.  Very accessible and playable, seems like it would go over well with families.  I could see it getting stale after a bit, though.  I see that there are a few expansions and I like how well-suited the game is to storing them.  No big boxes needed for that!  The solitaire element doesn't bother me a bit, but if the word itself scares you this game might as well.

Let's not beat around the bush - this is Tetris: The Board Game.  I loved Tetris as a kid, and this is an excellent implementation.  Problems: it is the epitome of multiplayer solitaire, and there are only four boards included in the game.  Fortunately, it is very easily expandable and there's no limit to the number of people that can be playing at once, as long as there are multiple sets in use.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Often compared to Tetris, this game is a nice puzzle-y exercise.  It differs in that the pieces cannot be rotated as they are slide down the game board.  Also, the goal is not to simple fill the rows - its to fill specific spaces while leaving others open.  The latter is just the gimmick that makes the game interesting.  Player interaction? absolutely none.  Hence, the game is more solitaire or exercise in nature.  Treated as a filler it's worthwhile.

First play: Obviously Tetris remake as a board game. Utterly a puzzle with no interaction between the players at all apart from swearing when the shapes don't fall out as needed.

At least Tetris warns you what shape is coming out next, this seems to be a best fit lottery at least in the first half of the game with the second half allowing some structure as the shape options are deminished.

I think it would be better to get all players starting with the same shape and making all keep their boards secret. At least that way it would be a level playing field as to who played best. Could it be that this varient was tried and good players saw the same best fit options too often?

Another nice, easy, filler or introductory game. FITS is basically Tetris with some strategy on how to fill or leave unfilled certain spaces. FITS is one of those games (like Sorry Sliders or Los Mampfos) that I can show anybody and they just love it and want to play it over and over. That is a good thing.

1.) I'm not going to make fun of this game anymore after it just schooled me.  I am not worthy of it's awesomeness
2.) I still think Tetris is a game for the computer.
3.) This game makes my head hurt.
4.) While not terrible, I wouldn't call this game good, either.  The thing is, at any given moment, it's what you have existing vs. one piece.  You fit that piece in with next to zero knowledge of the next piece.  You can guess what's coming up by what you have left on the table in front of you, to a point---but ultimately that's a futile exercise in that feeling of stepping in something your dog left behind.  The opportunities to make your own luck, so-to-speak, are next to nothing here.


downgraded to a 4, after I found myself saying too often, "I hope I don't end-up playing this game..."  I'll play it, but I would almost rather play anything else that exists.

A really enjoyable puzzle game.  If you enjoy Tetris, you will really get a kick out of this game (it's no coincidence that they look the same.)  I love how the different boards challenge you.  It just amazes me that you get so much variety with nothing but a different starting piece.  If you don't like puzzle games or multi-player solitaire, then this will not suit you, but I don't mind either of those things.  My wife loves it which is another bonus, and it's easily accessible for non-gamers.  I also greatly appreciate the fact that you can play the game solitaire.

Rarely do I get excited about expansions, but this game is just loaded with possibilities and has me itching for more.  I foresee FITS being a permanent fixture on our game table for years to come.  I have yet to find a single person who doesn't like the game, and enjoy the simple elegance of the game design.  People will literally be begging for a particular piece to come up, and yelling at the card shuffler for putting the piece they needed at the bottom of the deck.

(Note:  Could easily be played with more players if you simply bought a second copy of the game.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2.5
This game does has no need for existence.  Anyone who wants to play Tetris, will.  The random cards make things unbearable, and nearly impossible to plan ahead at all.  The game seems to be an exercise in who can get the right card at the right time, as that will win you the game, as long as you have the mental capacity to not shoot yourself in the foot prematurely.

Might be enjoyable for a young kid learning to manipulate shapes.  Adults wanting to play this...there are so many better games out there for your money.  Get Blokus instead.  If you have Blokus, play it instead.

A LOT better than I was expecting. Plays quickly, and the rules are really easy, but provide for some risk management and puzzlely goodness.

RATING: 4
Quick filler - if it lasted longer I'd drop my rating.

Mix of tetris and bingo. You have more control than tetris because you can flip the bits, but less control because you have no look ahead and can't horizontally slide.

Don't particularly like the different starting bits for players, not sure this variation adds anything other than luck of the order the bits come out to the game (I suppose it stops people copying each other ...)

Definitely multiplayer solo - no interaction at all.

All in all, not a brilliant game - I'd play it as a filler if nothing better was offered, but for a tetris experience I'd rather play tetris.

Surprisingly challenging, despite the complete lack of player interaction. It's definitely a fun game for those who like puzzles, and the competitive aspect is entirely fair. The box very accurately says 1-4 players, though.

Take it Easy meets Tetris and produces a very attractive child, combining most of the best parts of both and, to be fair, with a few extra tweaks which almost justify the design credit for Herr Knizia!  

It helps too that it plays quickly and smoothly and doesn't over-stay its welcome.  It's also very nicely produced, as you may expect from Ravenburger.  All in all a very attractive package.  Recommended to just about everyone.

I don't know what the heck was so appealing about this game, but I tend to really like multi-player solitaire puzzle games such as Take It Easy, Finito, and Cities, and this game certainly fits the bill!  The idea of Tetris turned into a board game sounds hokey, but the variances on the boards you play over the four rounds really do make it challenging and interesting.  I had planned on ignoring this game, but happened into a game of it and I'm glad I did!

A definite Tetris ripoff, but heck does this game work.  Declan likes playin with the pieces and everyone else just seems to enjoy the frustration as the piece you want to come out doesn't come out until the round after it would have helped even slightly.

This could almost be called Tetris: The Board Game! Well, it’s not exactly true as there are many differently shaped tiles and only one of each. Also, there are many different “maps” in which you don’t want to complete/fill out your rows! I liked this aspect of the game; how to fit your pieces the best way possible onto your player board. If played with a timer, it turns the cozy game into a frantic one! I can’t wait to show this game to my wife as I think she is going to like it quite a lot; it’s a multiplayer solitaire puzzle, but that’s definitely not a negative thing.

Board game Tetris so there is zero player interaction but still found it surprisingly fun for what it was. Everyone has the same board and pieces with the scoring different each of the 4 rounds. Each player is also missing a different piece each round so the boards at the end of each round will be different. Score points based on the rules for that round and determine a winner. Very much a puzzle game, but it plays lightning fast even with 4 new players and would surely go over well with anyone who is a non-gamer.

13 plays (2p, 3p, 4p)... lots of fun! Just like it seems, plus the dynamic challenge of the progress board challenges. The bits are great--more solid than I expected. It is another valuable game like Take it Easy, openly multiplayer solitaire in a good way. This one allows for a lot of cursing, jive talk, and trying to come up with pet names (some obscene) for all the pieces... It offers puzzle solving fun and non-confrontational (nor passive-aggressive) competition which is best for some situations. The tetris bits are chunkier than I expected. My rating may rise.

This is a fabulous little game. It doesn't seem like there is much to it....its just Tetris with multiple players and some additional goals and ways to score points (not just trying to get horizontal rows).

But this is eminently accessible...quick to play, and delightful.  What a pleasant surprise. I'll be getting a copy at the first opportunity.

Fits is one of those games that I think is trying to do something that is entirely unnecessary; in this case, translating Tetris into a board game. 

Each player has a collection of identical Tetris type pieces and a small "board" that they will be placed on. Each round a random piece is chosen that everyone has to place on their board. The boards are all are covered with dots that players want to cover (lest they score negative points) and later rounds have special dots that can be more important to cover (or leave uncovered).

The game has more control than Tetris in that players can opt to toss away pieces they don't want to use, and in that pieces can be rotated back to front as well as circularly. It has less control than Tetris in that pieces must fall vertically with no horizontal sliding allowed and because there is no look-ahead (though the latter could easily be fixed).

During the course of the game the other players are wholly unnecessary. Everyone is busy building on their own board, and scores are simply checked at the end of the game. I guess if I was a Tetris fiend I might find this interesting, but I've never been crazy about the Russian video game phenomenon, and I found Fits similarly average. It doesn't bother me in any real way, and it's pretty short, but I don't see any reason to ever play this game again aside from filling a seat at a table for someone. For my tastes it's too long as well, though that's largely because I don't find the game all that engaging. My call? Spend 10$ buying a Tetris cartridge for your NES and leave this one on the shelf.

Fun, but I wonder how much replay value this has.  Differently shaped pieces are slid down a ramp into a grid.  The goals of what to achieve differ according to the map on the ramp.  Cards are turned to show the players which shaped piece to place.  The cards can vary the placement order and more maps could be made but it seems more like puzzle solving.

First play was harder than I thought it would be.  Second play went much more smoothly even though I only scored 14 (I was in the negatives for the first).  I like how the 4 different boards shake up the scoring for that round - makes this a much more interesting game than simply a tetris puzzle.  Solo games were fun, playing 3p was even better although there's not a lot of direct player interaction.  It's fun to get a piece that matches what you need perfectly while the same piece completely destroys your opponent's plan!  Some interesting PnP expansions available -- want to try.

RATING: 6
For same reason I was expecting a little more. Even though people's charactarization of it being Tetris are exactly right. With the expection that you can't move pieces horizontally, and there are 4 different ways to score (+/- for leaving holes in specific places). Slightly less thinky that Ubongo, and less pressure since not a race. But because of that you sometimes need to put pressure on people to go. A decent choice for total non-gamers. And kids. Oh, despite being a big bix game by a major publisher, the cards are extremely cheap.

RATING: 7
As spatial manipulation is my weakest gaming skill, I admit to a visceral dislike of the genre. But I find FITS to be quite fun, despite it being completely non-interactive and purely tactical. In terms of decision density, it seems to scratch the same itch as something like Factory Fun, but in a much more streamlined and concise manner; it feels like it's just about the right length for something so light. It's resemblance to Tetris and simplicity makes it a good filler; it's interesting but never sadistic board layouts ensure a pleasant level of angst about how and whether to place new pieces.

Yes it's multiplayer solitaire.  So what, it's a blast.  There's lots of social interaction as we beg for just the right piece to come up next, and complain when it doesn't.  That's not gaming interaction, but it's fun.  If Keltis had not won SdJ this would be my prediction for the win.  I don't think Reiner will win two years in a row, but this is a far, far better game than Keltis.

Update: FITS has now been named to the short list for SdJ consideration.  If I had a vote, I'd vote for FITS.  I've played this with up to 8 people using 2 copies.  It works great with more than 4, and my rating has increased to 9.

As part of my never-ending quest to find games that my girlfriend might play with me, I stumbled upon FITS. It did deliver. The core mechanisms of FITS are clearly taken from Tetris. Every player slides down some Tetris-like shaped tiles down their personal playing board, trying to cover up the points that will give you negative points while leaving the positive scoring points open. Basically, this is a simultaneous puzzle without any interaction. Strangely, it is fun and my girlfriend enjoys it.

I guess, it has some of the "Knizia feel" that is also found in games like Battle Line or Lost Cities. Each turn, you are forced to make a decision without full knowledge. In fact, you do begin these games with very little knowledge: In Battle Line and Lost Cities, you don’t know for sure which cards you’ll get. In Fits you don’t know the order in which the tiles will show up. So, at the start of the game, you’re just trying to keep your options open. After a few turns, your knowledge increases and you can make better decisions and start to develop a plan, if it isn’t too late then and you made some bad mistakes in the beginning. I do really like this aspect of Knizia’s games as it reminds me of life itself where most of our decisions are made based on imperfect knowledge.

To sum it up: I like the solo puzzle that FITS is and my girlfriend even asks for it. Sure, this won’t hit the table if I want something meaty, but it is a lot of fun to chase your personal high score.

I don't usually like abstracts, but I really enjoyed this one.  Obviously, it is like Tetris, but is untimed.  This game makes for good filler.  Also, it is easily approached by non-gamers as they may have played Tetris in the past.  Probably will buy it since my collection lacks "filler" games.  An 8 from me for this type of game is very high since I usually don't like fillers or abstracts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Players flip up a common card which indicates what shape they have to "slide" onto their puzzle board.  When all cards have been played through, score points according to that board's criteria.  Best described as the Tetris board game, played with Blokus pieces, Take It Easy style.  The rules take about 15 seconds to explain, the components are simple, but attractive, and the game is a fun filled 20 minutes.  Get two sets and expand it to 8 players.  The only (tiny) fault I can find is they could have printed the scoring rules on the different boards.  Good stuff.

I enjoy visualizing how shapes might fit together, and so somehow ended up with two copies of this game -- full sized and travel.  I'd suggest that one version is sufficient.

Bought it cheap on a whim from Amazon and we're racking up the plays.  Absolutely great fun and an awesome gateway.

"No, make it New Mysterio!"

Very disappointed in these very cheap, easy to break bases.  Throw away retail packaging of items have thicker & stronger plastic than these game components intended for repeated plays.  The starting & building  cards are flimsy.  The tiles themselves are good quality and the game boards that fit into the bases are sturdy.  

I love the play.  I am having a hard time getting a positive score!  A great solitaire challenge, and am anxious to play with others.  I rate the play at 7, but my disappoint in the quality (unusual for Ravensburger), lowers it.

Jogo de tabuleiro inspirado no famoso jogo de encaixar pecinhas estranhas, o Tetris. Cada jogador tem um tabuleiro inclinado e, a partir de cartas viradas em cada rodada, deve deslizar e encaixar suas peças nas anteriormente colocadas. Cada partida é dividida em 4 turnos. Cada turno tem um tabuleiro diferente que muda a estratégia de colocação das peças. Apesar de não haver tempo, assim como no jogo original, o ponto alto do jogo é encaixar errado as peças fazendo uma grande cag#8ª no seu jogo. Fácil, rápido e divertido.

Tetris - The Board Game. Does it work? Yes and no. The defining characteristic of the video game really is the frantic struggle to get the piece to their rightful place on the playing field, and quickly. This aspect is - unsurprisingly - completely lost from Fits. Instead, the game caters to the solo puzzler crowd. 
 
The pieces are more complicated than in the original to make for a bigger challenge, and each piece will appear once in random order. The primary goal is to complete lines, but later boards add special rules where not covering something scores bonus points.

In short, this is one for the Take It Easy crowd.

Well, this fills the Tetris void perfectly! It has all the feel of the game but done in a classic board game style. Like this one quite a bit! Feels very multiplayer solitaire, but no biggie.  I love Knizia games - I love Tetris - I love abstracts. So, this purchase was a no brainer.

RATING: 7
FITS is a geometric group solitaire game in the same vein as Take It Easy, Mosaix, and Ubongo.  There's not a lot going on here, which is something of a criticism but also the source of its greatest strength.  That strength is the game's immediacy and broad appeal.  FITS works well with casual gamers and non-gamers because of its familiarity and ease of play.  It has also seen quite a lot of play in certain segments of our gaming circle.  My rating is a compromise between my own enjoyment (7) and the game's value within my collection (8).

We've had a lot of fun with the table talk surrounding this game.  The weirdest shaped piece is called "Asparagus" for reasons that I have never revealed.  The U-shaped piece is called "Comfy Chair" or more properly "Comfy Chair, Viewed From Above."  The short T and the long T are called "Buffalo" and "Albany" but none of us can ever remember which is which.  The cross is called "Wednesday" which is a reference to the forehead crosses worn by some Christians on Ash Wednesday.  If we need that piece to come up next, we sometimes place it on our foreheads as a form of intercessory prayer.  There are some other names, but those are the most interesting ones so far.

The game could use a bit of variety from game to game. The solution is to print a couple sets of expansion boards. Knizia's "official" print-and-play expansion that is very good (better than the original boards, in fact). Ted Alspach's unofficial BOTS expansion is also good (although I would skip MOTS and LOTS). Finally, there is a very fun single board titled "Boom Expansion" that can be found in the files section.

Yes, it's very solitaire. But we usually manage to have plenty of conversation during our games about the pieces we need, or absolutely DO NOT need. The different scoring each round is a tiny hurdle for some, but most seem to grasp things pretty quickly and for the puzzle-lovers, this one works very well.

Although I like it, I had higher hopes for FITS. The problem is that drawing a useful tile does not have the same sense of satisfaction that it does in other similar games (Take it Easy being the most obvious example). Even when things go perfectly, the result is mild pleasure rather than whoops of joy.

Further to this, FITS feels very much like you're just doing the best you can. There's no "solution" so to speak, so there's never an "aha!" moment when you figure out how to place a tile. Compare this to Ubongo: in that game, there *is* a solution, and when you discover it, it's very satisfying indeed.

This is a fun game which will appeal to anybody who likes Tetris.  It does require some practice to get used to what's a good play and what's not.  It's best to spare some thought about "what happens if this difficult tile shows up next turn?"... although "screw that, I'm not playing that tile" is often the right move.  A friendly game with suggestions from fellow players is a good way to learn.

There probably should be a timer for each turn to avoid players agonizing for way too long over certain decisions.

There is a lot to like here. It's light and quick moving, and doesn't take much time. A very good filler. Though it pales in comparison to Tetris, lacking the time constraints and player interaction of that classic. In fact Fits has near zero player interaction, which means it will never rate much better than a 7 for me.

Probably about as close to "Tetris the Board Game" as we're going to get (except of course for "Tetris", but this seems to be a much more interesting variation that that early effort). Easy to grasp and makes for a nice spatial puzzle-like filler. Likely to be a good game for kids. Kind of weirdly reminiscent of Blokus given the total difference in gameplay and mechanics - I think it is mostly just the bright colors and shape of the game pieces.

Mother's Day gift for the wife - I think it's a keeper, as it's simple to learn yet challenging and quick to play.

Seems to scales well to different age groups.

RATING: 8
Another clever game from Knizia. Another frustrating one too. I like it, but I hate it. It is a genius of game design, yet it is more painful than having my teeth pulled out when the pieces don't fit properly or as efficiently as I want them to. Do I want to subject myself to that kind of torture again? I'd say no. Some analytical types will absolutely love this, but it's not for me. But, maybe I'll play it one more time--I think I could do better...

Update (07/03/09): Okay, I did better--I even won! Here's a bit of FITS philosophy at 3 AM: "You must free your mind and think outside the box. Do not seek perfection, let it seek you. Anticipate what pieces will fit, and wait for their arrival. You must be one with the tetris pieces. Go with the flow."

Update (09/19/09) 5 plays: This is a perfect filler, if one wants something to play for 30-45 minutes, while waiting for other players to show up. It is easy to set-up and take down, teach newbies, and it is possible to end the game prematurely at the end of one of the four boards--it's hard to make a personal investment is this type of game. It may be torture for the first-time player, however. As I have gotten used to it, it doesn't stress me out anymore since I have achieved "FITS philosophy", or "FITS enlightenment". See above/below.

FITS Haiku
-------------------------------
Give up a few dots.
Save the numbers and symbols,
Then score massively.

Seek perfection, not.
Let the perfection seek you.
The pieces will fit.

Let the pieces fall
Where they may, but not lament.
Next one is a gift.

Be one with pieces.
Seek inner peace, not the score.
Still, go with the flow.

Anticipate one.
Anticipate all that is.
Patiently await.

Quickly, let it go
One that refuses to fit,
In the scheme of things.

Free the mind of stuff
Of the order, shape, and size.
Success is the prize.

Empty is the sound,
Of the arrival of one...
Nicely fitting piece?

Chaos is the way
The Universe telling you,
You don't get it.

July09:  Well, it's fast, fun and has interesting decisions.  What more is there to it?

After playing a few times, I like it better than Ubongo.  It feels more achievable, and flexes more trainable muscles.

I really like the feeling of backing yourself into a corner.  It replicates tetris nicely.

Make sure and check out BOTS by Ted (Toulouse).  That one adds a lot to it.

Also, do remember you *can* pass.  I always seem to want to pass on that stupid cross piece.

The Tetris comparisons are unavoidable.  However, had he left the game as a vanilla implementation of Tetris, it would have been beneath Knizia's talent.  Instead, he cleverly devised 4 variants -- requiring players to leave gaps to score points.  A fine game even for the spatial-reaonsing-imparied (such as myself).

I underestimated how fun this game would be.  I was never a big Tetris fan, but I really like these Take It Easy-type games.  The rules are very easy to explain and it can actually be pretty challenging.  I thought it was pretty easy, but I must have had an unusual first game, as negative scores were very common in the second game.  This makes me think that it might not be as good of a gateway game as I thought, as my family didn't like how you could score negative, which I can understand.

As I posted on my plays of this game. This probably shouldn't even be a board game. There is no interaction until the final score is tallied. While ok, it is all about managing risk of what pieces might come later and getting lucky when you have to press your luck.

I'm willing to play it a few more times to see if it gets better or worse, but I already prefer blokus in every way...

The game doesn't even come with a score card / board for the four rounds of play? Lazy. How did this get a nod for spiel des jahres?

The first thing one thinks of when seeing the game is Tetris, and upon playing the game it kinda feels like Tetris, but with a lot of twists, not only due to the rules but also due to whatever board you're playing on at the time.

Quick and easy to teach and play, this game is a lot of fun and works well with any number of players. The seed piece that differs for each player each round ensures that no two players boards will play out the same, so each player will have a unique experience and how well they do will depend on luck and knowing how to keep their options open.

FITS fulfills a lot of what I like about gaming: it's very easy to learn (if you've ever played Tetris, it takes about 3 more minutes to explain beyond that), it's quick (we were able to play a game in about 30 minutes), and there's not a lot of downtime. That being said this isn't the kind of game I'm going to remember for a long time afterwards - I've played some mammoth games of Tales of the Arabian Knights that I'll always remember, for example, or some games of Descent. But this game isn't really trying to fill either of those roles. For what it does it's one of the best games out there IMO.

RATING: 8.5
The sheer brevity of the rules really leads you to believe this might be nothing more than a mindless boredom buster.  In practice though, Knizia has developed an engaging game that goes from deceptively simple in round 1 to unforgiving by round 4.  The quick playtime lends itself well to that need for one more round.  Excellent family game!

Very solid spatial-positioning game.  There's a decent amount of luck and maybe even en element of push-your-luck, but all that makes it perfect to play with almost anyone.  And yeah, "Tetris: The Boardgame" fits it pretty well.

Fun puzzle solving game that takes ZERO time to explain.  Components are excellent, gameplay is what you would expect - solid but not spectacular.

Playing the game is enjoyable, but the game does not leave you wanting to play again right away.

Nice filler along the lines of Ubongo or Can't Stop, but just a tier below.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It is very important to play this game with old-school tetris gameboy music playing in the background.  The big question is  whether to use music A, B or C.  While arguments can be made for all 3, I think that "C" is the winner, due to its fairly upbeat tempo.  I find that when I play with music A, I have a tendency to get complacent, and allow holes to build up that are not strictly necessary.  Music C, on the other hand, provides the appropriate urgency required to make timely and effective decisions.

This is a fun game, not terribly deep, but not all games have to be.

RATING: 6
Nice simple puzzle game that is good for kids and adults. Different boards and scoring add to some variety. Not exactly like Tetris in that you cannot slide pieces left or right after moving them down, and with each player having a different starting piece, it does add some randomness, but is fun for what it is. A nice variant may be to show the next piece coming out.

Enjoyable puzzle game that plays very quickly.  My initial impression was that the base board was very boring and pointless.  Well, now I find "pointless" to be a significant problem for me on the first board as it is always my lowest scoring board any more!  Go figure!  Looking forward to giving some of the fan made expansions a go.  Not really Tetris as you can't move it around once you start sliding the piece down but the pieces are very tactile and enjoyable to play with here.  I'm moving the rating from a 6 to a 7 after 20 plays.

Similarities to Tetris cannot go unavoided. Pieces fall from the top and rest on other pieces below them. Differences include: 
* In FITS pieces only fall from the top. In Tetris you could make a last second slide to fill in a previous whole.
* Tetris only includes tetronimoes (pieces made from four adjacent squares), hence the name Tetris. FITS only includes these tetronimoes (except the 4-long piece), but mostly it includes 5-pieces or a few 3 pieces.
* FITS lacks the cool Tetris music from the Gameboy edition. This was some seriously addictive music as I can still recite it to this day.

The game works because of one rule I missed the first time I played. *** Each solid dot that is uncovered at the end of the round is -1 point. ***

Turn-based Tetris with Blokus pieces.  Seemed like it had lots of potential, but turned out to be less fun than either Tetris or Blokus.

12/26/10 Played a three-player game. FITS has absolutely no player interaction. The three of us could have as easily played the game in three different rooms and then compared our scores at game end. Its merely a solitaire puzzle, *not* a game. And for me the shine wore off very quickly. I won't go so far as to say I was flat out bored. But I reckon I would be if I ever play it again.  If I played it again it would only be to humor the owner.

This is for the novelty aspect -- something that could be busted out once in a long while.

This is a multiplayer puzzle game.
You play 4 rounds with the other players trying to out do each others score using the same set of tetris like pieces. 

Those pieces can go in lots of different ways so each time you learn something new.

If you love doing puzzles (such as Sudoku etc) this takes it to a more social activity. Another good game from Reiner!

This has great potential as a family game as you can play it on your own to practice or together with the whole family.

For something so simple, the concept truly feels brilliant. Simultaneous turns make the game go fairly quickly, and the different starting bricks ensure that no two boards can be the same, even if the players think alike.

I was surprised how much I liked this, considering my complete lack of spacial ability. It is very much like manual Tetris, though you can't move a piece left or right to slot it into an existing gap like you can in the computer game.

The four of us that were playing were amazingly varied in our skill level. If I was average, one player was the God of Fits, and the other two were seemingly playing with blindfolds on! If you demand player interaction in your games, then this will disappoint, but if you like competitive puzzles you need to have this game in your collection.

A Tetris re-theme.  First round you will want to play all the pieces without missing any space.  Second round you will start noticing the pieces do NOT want to cover the spaces that have a point circle on them.  Keep them uncovered and gain the points, but still try and cover all other spaces as they will be penalized.

A good non-gamer game everyone can enjoy.  Who never played Tetris?  Not many people I know.

First impression (2 player): Well, it looks like Tetris and plays pretty much the same. It's multiplayer solitaire puzzle experience really as everyone plays own board without interaction to others. One good idea that every player starts with a different piece at the beginning so no one can mimic other players board and play exactly the same.

Gameplay changes a bit with different boards during four rounds for some variety during the game.

I don't much care for [gameid=25294], so this one was a pleasant surprise. The basic idea of the puzzle is already a lot more interesting, and the random starting piece makes a huge difference on top of that. Plays quickly, too.

Appallingly derivative but also surprisingly enjoyable, even solo. Quick, engaging, tactile - there's not really much more to ask for. Just make sure you PnP the expansion boards for the maximum variety.

This is not Tetris...Thank goodness! But, it is similar in that it is really quick to teach and play with new gamers! Simple filler game and the replay ability is surprisingly good...every game is different! This is a game you could buy alone and be done with it (no more expansion purchases); however, that being said...I still hope there will be some new expansion boards! 

Everyone starts with the same board...but each player draws a starter piece. This is where the game achieves its diversity!

RATING: 8
A really good, short and competitive abstract game. No interactions between players but I'm not sure that it matters for a game like this. Will need to make up some more boards for variety.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It has the same easy-going solitaire nature as Take It Easy, everyone placing the same piece to the their own copy of the same board, but the different starting pieces ensure no one's placements will be the same. If you like that, you should like this, and any number of people can play with enough sets. It's a pleasant opener with easy rules and it can be pulled out with non-gamers, all of which is a thumbs up for its niche, but it's a bit samey from game to game so you need to spread some time between plays. Especially when you're essentially playing it 4 times each game, the only difference being the variations on how to score (complete rows, leave certain spaces uncovered, etc).

Simple game play, yes it is like Tetris. There is a lot of frustration when you do not get the piece you want, but you need to play all the pieces as best you can, so you need to adapt. The different bonuses and penalties on the boards add variety from round to round. A lot of fun and laughs.

The pieces call out for you to touch them, and the four different scoring methods are cleverly designed.  I've had both interesting and dull games of this, and it seems to depend on the mix of players.

RATING: 7
This game has been described as Tetris meets Take It Easy, and that description is apt.  After each player places a different initial tile, tiles are called communally, and each player must fit that tile on their board, trying to cover or not cover certain spaces.  This game is both very accessible and very strategic, but like Take It Easy, there is virtually no player interaction.  I wish the game came with more than four boards, because there's no reason why it shouldn't play with more than four people.

Superb puzzling game that really does capture the feel of Tetris in a boardgame.

It plays quickly, and EVERYONE knows how to play Tetris, so it doesn't take much explaining to introduce this game to new players.

WARNING: The plastic tile pieces are great, although the moulded plastic bases are far too weak & cheaply made to stand up to any abuse - take care during play not to accidentally lean on them for example! Would have preferred a simple flat plastic board with the same grooves for the pieces to slide along if it could have been a bit thicker. The big sloped bases may make a nice photo, but they are definitely not needed.

NOTE: Cards are about 56mm square (maybe just under?). Needs "Standard USA" sleeves from Mayday or FFG.

A nostalgic trip courtesy of Dr Knizia of bringing a Tetris variant to the table, the only difference is the scoring, no sideways movement allowed. One apsect it lacks the speed element to add to the proceedings. If you dislike the elimination aspect of Blockus with more than 2 players and enjoy Take It Easy, check this design out.

I really enjoyed this game and I'm not a big fan of tetris  style games at all. Found it at a local thrift shop brand new and when I finally got to play it my fellow players didn't seem too enthralled but I REALLY enjoyed it.

A game that derives it fun from the social interaction with others as players cheer the perfect piece while cursing the bad ones.  But under that, just really a solitaire game with loses a lot of its interest with that social interaction removed.  A puzzle game in the mode of Tetris but missing the skill of shifting a piece sideways at the last second to hook into overhangs and with a non-clearing board.  Will see how play develops, but think the bonus points on the board are traps.  More points to be scored by filling lines and avoiding the penalty points gaps in general.

Update: This one has grown on me. As a type of abstract "pick-up-and-play" gateway game unbeatable. Plus: Reiner's downloadable expansion still increases longevity of the game.

Another winner from Knizia. Tetris - the board game. All players have the same Tetris pieces and everybody has a different starting piece.

If Tetris were a board game and over in one minute, this would be it. Pieces are announced one at a time and placed at the top of your "frame" and slid into place. Components are nice. The game has several scoring rounds to make things more interesting. At first you get points for full lines only, then they dock you for each gap you leave, then they change the scoring for certain gaps so some are better to cover and some to show. Overall, it's a simple non-interactive puzzle game. I'm fine with playing it every so often if the others at the table really want to, but I don't see a reason to own it. Sold my copy.

As multiplayer solitaire goes, this is pretty good. It doesn't even pretend it's not multiplayer solitaire, which is not what you can say with a lot of Euros. Fun game that tests your Tetris-like skills, and it's actually fun playing solo. The board design smells of Knizia, and so does the simple elegance of letting everybody have different start tiles to mess your dropping order up.

That said, I'll introduce this to people at game night, but I wouldn't want to spend too much time playing it.

One of my favorite video games of all time is Tetris.  I burned away hours of my freshman year at college playing the game.  I still play a 3D implementation called Blockout to this day.  Pair this with Knizia (who still at least gets a look from me) and this ended up being a must-buy for me.

Fortunately, the game play followed through.  Sure, it is nothing terribly difficult and the order that the tiles come out can have a profound impact on the game.  But it is a quick game, and it is fun.  It definitely appeals to the puzzle-fitting portion of my brain that Ubongo also strokes only on a friendlier (and much less stressful) level of competition.   

While my plays have slowed down somewhat, I do still try to get it in every now again.  My kids in particular enjoy it.  Perhaps it is about time to look at some of the expansion boards that are out there?  [12/15/2010]

Fits -- Played once; four-players.

The quality of the bits definitely improves the experience of the gameplay.  I scored the worst in every round, but I found it quite fun.  I think this will have broad appeal, as it is very approachable, and plays quickly.  Furthermore, like [i]Bingo[/i], and [i]Take It to the Limit[/i], the number of players can be increased by adding more sets.

The similarity to Tetris gets a first-timer going very quickly and makes this a great entry game. The changing game boards (and unique shapes) are the stroke of genius that make it a very different experience than the video game classic.
With easily-made homemade extensions (and now a Knizia one) the game will seem to have many lives. Highly recommended.

Silly spatial fun. Players start with a random Tetri-style piece they place on their board. Cards are then flipped and all players have to decide how to orientate and slide the pieces down. Points are scored according to the board (there are four) being played.

Quick 20-minute filler that's good for laughs as players' faces are locked in deep concentration as they try to orientate pieces...and then screw placement up anyway.

Very un-Kniza and I like it even though my score is usually in the negative.

Knizia does Tetris! This quick, simple little game was played almost continuously! It's a nice diversion, although a bit light for my tastes.

Each player has the same mix of blokus/tetris like shapes. A deck of 4 starter shapes is shuffled and dealt 1/player --> starting piece. Another deck of cards, 1/shape is shuffled; then each is revealed, one by one. For each, play the piece shown almost like Tetris pieces: the difference is that no lateral movement is allowed. Play through the deck 4 times, each time with slightly different scoring rules (and appropriate backgrounds for each player's play area):
1. complete row = 1VP, visible spot = -1VP
2. visible numbers = +VP, visible spot = -1VP
3. visible numbers = +VP, visible spot or penalty spot = -VP
4. each visible pair of matching symbols = +3VP, each visible unmatched symbol = -3VP

My wife played this at a con a while ago and liked it so I had it on my list and finally picked it up and had a chance to play it.  I wasn’t expecting a whole lot but it surprised me how difficult it was to score.  It IS multi-player solitaire, and the angled boards make it even MORE solitaire since it is difficult to see what others have done or are doing unless they show you.  All in all I liked it as a fast 15-20 minute filler.

addictive simple filler gameplay, with interesting knizia scoring.  Has a place in most people's collections.  Is it luck-based?  Yes, almost entirely, but like most good push-your-luck games, the fun lies in trying to mitigate the luck as much as possible through placing tiles in their best possible location to leave open spots for your remaining tiles.

RATING: 7
[Ravensburger USA 2009 edition] {Abstract, family; puzzle, multiplayer-solitaire; scalable} FITS is an interesting puzzle game from Knizia.  It's especially attractive for Tetris fans.  Round 1-3 are easy and Round 4 is the only challenging one.  The game time is appropriate: 30-40 minutes per game.  I have some concerns about Replayability.  But I see opportunities for expansions.

It's a good gateway / entry game. (maybe, it's more approachable than Ubongo, which some of my friends find it difficult.)

The components are attractive.  It is colorful.  The trays and tiles are nicely crafted.  However, the cards are too thin!

During Gathering 2009 I was proclaiming this the hit of the week. By the end of the week, however (approximately 6-7 plays later), I had seen just about all there is to see. If I can find a copy at a reasonable price, I'll probably grab it, as it will be great to introduce to non-gamers.

This game is perfect in every way.  Fun, easy to teach, and infinitely replayable.  Sure, it may get a bit samey once you've played the heck out of it, but it's always challenging and a lot of fun.  A brilliant design by Reiner Knizia that is so simple kids can play it yet challenging enough to torture adults.

Tetris - the board game.  Strange idea, but it works!

RATING: 7
tl;dr: fun, family puzzle

I'm quite good at spacial games, so this is a good game for me. The rules are really simple, yet the way that the pieces come out (which causes a good amount of luck) makes it a good challenge. Optimizing the pieces you get and planning ahead for the next rounds, not knowing what will be next, is quite good fun. Also, the different boards add different challenges and scoring opportunities.
Very basic, but also very effective.

This one could have been called Tetris: The Boardgame pretty darn easily. 

I'm not saying that as a bad thing.  I like Tetris, many people do, which also makes this a very good candidate for Gateway game.  I think this one is a pretty good one to fill that niche.

If I can't figure out a better way to score Ubongo, then I'm probably going to trade it and keep Fits.

RATING: 6
Not a bad game.  After hearing about it on a few podcasts and then downloading the rules I felt this game would land in a certain niche in my collection that could use a little help.  Essentially the "non boardgamer" section.  This game will certainly appeal to those that normally would not even CONSIDER sitting down to a boardgame - and add to it that I don't mind it much either - it will be a good addtion.

Tetris with a board!  This one is a winner.  Sure, it's abstract, sure, it's not exactly the most complicated thing ever, and sure, it's hard to believe someone hadn't thought of it previously.  But they didn't, which meant Knizia got my money.  A hit in my group.

RATING: 6
Its Tetris the Boardgame. Like Tetris, you play a piece the wrong way and you are screwed. Sometimes it is easy to score big and it is also easy to hose yourself. Less frentic than  Tetris, but if you don't like that game, you probably won't like this either.

RATING: 6
This is a familiar feeling game to those of us who played a lot of Tetris way back when.  I think this game benefits from a little bit of a rushed feeling, since that forces people to not overthink things, which is a good thing in a filler game.

Not great, but better than I thought. However, printing some of the pnp expansions is mandatory for replayability. I dont understand why they only put 4 in the box,

If you like games like Ubongo, Take it easy, Factory fun, etc., you should also like Fits.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very fun, quick-playing game for 1-4 players. Since there are only 4 playing boards and all 4 boards are used each game, there might be limited replayability, but Bezier Games is publishing several print-and-play expansion boards soon. This game is very much like Tetris and has some very nice scoring differences from one board to the next. Perfect family game as anybody can play it.

A dead-ringer for a spouse-pleasing game.  Most of the girls I know, or at least those in my family, love Tetris.  And this game is manual Tetris, with some interesting goal-oriented twists.  Good little game, and one that will be played for years to come in our house.  Kids love it as well.

My wife loves Carcassonne and one of the things she loves is the puzzle building aspect.  FITS fits that criteria.  She really likes it and so do I. 

I would like to pause here and reflect on the depth and breadth of Knizia's designs.

Scales well from 2-4 and is great to play with gamers and non-gamers, adults and kids (even young kids, they don't play well, but they can join without effecting other's games).

I will be getting/printing all expansions.  10 plays in I can see it will be getting played a lot more.

Update:  Rating falls from 7.5 to a 7. Has not gotten played a lot more. I still like the game and it clearly fits a niche in my collection.  

Update: rating holds at 7. This fits (seriously, I do not want to make a pun here) so many gaming situations for me that it will get its share of plays.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 2
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 3

This game works well for me, perhaps because I've played Blokus a lot, so the pieces are quite familiar, and I know how to interlock them. The multiple boards keep this game interesting. I'd like another copy (or two) so that more than four players can participate...

RATING: 6
Here's a filler that I actually enjoyed, despite my general spatial impairment. This is just a really clever Knizia design and it's nice to see him doing an original game for once rather than repackaging an existing design. Of course it shares the same pieces as Blokus, but is really a completely different game. It's an enjoyable solitaire puzzle that you can try to solve while sitting around the table with friends and then compare how you did at the end. The different boards, including the Alspach expansion boards, certainly help keep it interesting.

I like this game a lot since it's easy for all types of people to play.  Strategy is very limited yet this also means that children will have an easier time playing aside adults.  Any game that is quick and painless to play with my daughter and wife together is a great game!  The additional game boards add a lot of replayability to an already fun game.  Downside to the game is that it's only 4-player without having to buy more boards.

Tetris in board game form. Each player gets a different starting piece to place on their board, then all players place the same piece as the rest of the pieces come out. You must place each one following the simple rule of "rotate it however you wish, then drop it straight down from the top of the board".

It's amazing how different each player's board can get, given that all the pieces are the same order except for the first one. As with most spatial games, I massively sucked at it, ending up with a final score of 0. My round scores were +1 +1 -1 -1.

Fun, but this was enough plays for me. I no longer feel the need to purchase it.

At first, there seems to be a lot of luck playing into the game, since the card draw determines when you place your pieces, but at the same time, it's a lot like Tetris, in that you need to plan ahead for the pieces that you know are coming (and all the pieces WILL come into play).  You can even choose not to play a piece if it doesn't work toward your plan, so you're not stuck with something that you can't use.  At first, it seems like the game doesn't have much replayability, since you only get the four play mats, but with Ted Alspach creating expansions, I can see this having a better shelflife than as it comes from the publisher.  Plus, each player begins with a different start piece, so there's not as much chance that everyone will be playing the same game, as with Take It Easy.  Nice, and addictive.

FITS (Fill In The Spaces) is essentially a multi-player Tetris. Each player has an inclined board on which they place different polyominoes, with three, four, or five squares. Cards are drawn from a pile to tell the players which piece to take. The pieces may be rotated and reversed before they slide down the inclined area to dock to other gaming pieces, but unlike Tetris cannot be slid horizontally once dropped. Scoring is based on quantity and configuration of squares left uncovered.

Even though Knizia has been recycling a lot of old ideas and mechanics in his new releases, I have to say that FITS actually hits a nice spot in the casual gaming category.  True it doesn't take much skill to arrange the pieces as they come up nor does it involve a lot of strategy or planning.  However, the Take It Easy style of placement with the different goals each round complements well enough with each other to make the game enjoyable.

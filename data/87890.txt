Gra do ogarnięcia w krótkim czasie a myślenie nikomu jeszcze nie zaszkodziło polecam jako grę nad którą trzeba pomyśleć.

I like economic games, but this one was a little too heavy for me.  First of all, the amount of iconography is crippling, and there's no one place to reconcile it.  (I'm sure a player aid will help some.)  Secondly, it is a little too rules-heavy for me.  Even if I had a rules summary, it would take a while to refresh every time we played.  Lastly, it was unforgiving.  I made a mistake in month 1, realized it in month 2, and spent the next 3 hours or so with no hope of catching up.  Sheesh.

Having said that, I think the design is well-made, but I just don't think it's my style.

Pret is a worker placer that doesn't quite live up to its billing as a heavy economic game.  Sure, there's an economy here, but it is not at all difficult to fathom what's needed to make it work.  The heart of the game is a large variety of contract, building and employee cards that all make your engine run better in one way or another.  Some are clearly better than others, but I see that as a positive feature, forcing some tough decisions about prioritizing those worker placements. The cards offer various strategic options and therefore bring replayability. 

Pret also delivers a sense of too much to do in too little time; there are but two turns between each fashion show in which to put together your new collection and buy the necessary materials.  I quite enjoyed my game of Pret, though it did seem a bit long-winded for what isn't a heavy economic game.  However, game length could easily be reduced from twelve to nine turns.

I welcome the fashion industry theme as a refreshing change from medieval Germany.  I felt that the artwork was rather bland and could have made much more of flamboyant subject matter.  Production quality is good.

This game is great but very heavy. So much pieces and tokens and book keeping. I am biased though, I have a predisposition to like this game because of the unique theme. My wife and I like Fashion and there are not many games out there that tackle it. After getting another round in with the rules all ironed out, I can say this game is easily an 8.5 maybe even higher as I peel back all of the different strategies with more plays. Great game, but a real brain burner. I would give this a higher rating if I liked heavy games, but I prefer much lighter games that take somewhere in the hour mark to play. Still fantastic, just gotta pick and choose when we want this to hit the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
Second play.  Still very promising title.  I do very much like the tight competition for stars (awards for a good performance at the fashion shows).  It's pretty cut-throat, especially with 3 or 4 players.  There are lots of options and some calculations going on, which can lead to AP but once you get past the rules there is a very satsifying economic game here.   

This one is trending upwards and may rise further in my rankings.
*****
One play in some slightly distracting conditions (Iron Man was on the TV), but shows lots of promise as a difficult, ecommic game, with a novel and refreshing theme.  

Plays a lot like Agricola where it seems like you just dont have enought turns and/or workers to get it all done before the next fashion show comes around.

The structure is similar but instead of being dealt a hand of cards at the begining of the game, players use their actions and money to buy the cards as they go -- almost a "deck building" version of everyone's favorite farming game.

If you like this style of game it's worth a look.

my rating is pending another play.

I bought Prêt-à-Porter because I am always fascinated by economic snowball games, and this one has worker placement. And it has also fashion shows! A theme I couldn't care less... but pretty unusual for a boardgame! C'mon, wouldn't you jump at the chance to bee Zoolander for one day?

I was also wary about the unquestioned Ignacy Trzewiczek's quirk, paired with a tendency to not polishing mechanics enough and, worse, to produce troublesome rulebooks: I had a bad experience with 51st State and various friends had even worser with Stronghold...

Indeed the rules are definitely not user friendly: the english is not the best I've read (why didn't they find a native english-speaking translator??), and the key information is not easily understandable. Together with parsimony in illustrated examples, these problems let us struggling for a couple of hours, while parsing BGG for FAQ, before starting the game...

But back to the game: every player runs a fashion house for 12 months. There are fashion shows in march, june, september and december, and the other are preparation months. Every player has three actions (selected by placing action pawns) in each preparation month, so gets a grandtotal of 24 actions.
The actions allow to collect various types of cards (contracts, employees, buildings or designs) or materials, and the goal is presenting a large and/or trendy and/or quality collection at the next show(s). This leads to making money through selling collections, and in the end the player with most money wins.

The mechanics are well oiled and run quite smoothly. The interesting part of the game lays in the different cards, and the correct evaluation of which ones you need is tricky.

The theme is well integrated, and the production value is good (good materials, too tiny icons everywhere tough).

Overall, the game is indeed quite interesting, while not very innovative, and would like to play it again in the future.

IF this game idea was executed well it would be an average slightly boring euro with a bit too much downtime, and for me a bit too much randomness and kind-of-snowball. potentially, this idea could be made into a 6/10 game.

however, this game was NOT playtested. the rulebook was NOT playtested even more certainly. and graphic design is a joke. it's as if the artist went out of their way to make the graphic design hinder play. in places you have to hope the rulebook is plain wrong, or the game would be broken.

sadly, in current shape, avoid.
if this gets published in english hopefully the graphic design will be completely remade, and the rulebook completely rewritten (and this time perhaps someone will read it and try to play using it before publication), so if you see it in english it might be worth a play or 2.

A few minor changes to the graphic side of the game and I would love it. Unfortunately I hate being forced to read lots of text during the game and it makes it a lot harder to keep track of what everybody is doing around you. Really, there is a reason why in most of the games you have lots of easy to interprate icons not tons of text. It's not a big thing but personally for me it made it impossible to enjoy the game. Otherwise the mechanics seem to be really good.

The game has elements for a good game. But the designers just put too much elements in the game. The economy in the game works well, so it should be a good game... but there are way too many different cards with too many difficult and very small icons, so this ruins the game completely. Nobody at the table (all multiplayers) weren't keen to play this game a second time. So this game will end in the archives.

Essen '11: Mixed feelings on this one. The graphic design left something to be desired, ironic considering the fashion theme. There are also so many interacting mechanisms that it's hard to keep everything straight on a first (and likely second or third) play. This could be great with an experienced group, but I'm not so sure it's worth the effort.

RATING: 6
First play: In engineering terms this is a complex and interactive game. With a strong worker placement and financial engine, on paper I should really like this, but after two hours wrangling with the rules and another two hours play, I found the execution of this game tortuous.

The game is fiddly to say the least, the iconography mainly fails to adequately describe what each contract, building, and employer can do. As a result there is huge down time as each card is researched over and over again. The end result is a fragmented non cohesive experience that left me willing the game to end well before half time.

I'm guessing this is a game that needs several games to appreciate the rules, cards and nuances of what routes to take. However I'm plain not prepared to burn further hours on such a dry soulless experiences. My rating is generous for the build quality and structure of the mechanics, however a six in my book doesn't register a wish to replay willingly.

Likes:
   - The variety of things to do is simply amazing.  Interesting choices to be made each and every turn.
   - The graphic design of the game is totally awesome.
   - Very deep economic game, with a very elegent game engine.
Dislikes:
   - The theme is not my cup of tea, but at least it was different.
   - The rules leave a lot to be desired.  Really needed better player aids as well.
   - The symbols are terrible and pretty much useless.

Notes:
   - High quality components with nice art.  Really want to play again after fighting through the definitions of all the symbols.

Jan 2016 - I'm not sure about this.  First game was quite rough in having to look up every.single.card and then go to BGG to see how it should be applied.  This was very annoying.  

The cards also seemed to be strangely unbalanced in some aspects.  Perhaps this was because we didn't know the game?  

I, personally, didn't care for the randomness in the cards when you have so few actions to take.  I got nailed a couple of times thinking this would be a good thing to do only to watch the cards sit useless for two to four rounds because things did not come out.  Again, was this because it was our first game.

I'm not sure if I will play this again to see as it goes for quite a bit of cash at the moment.  If I don't sell or trade it, maybe I'll try it again and see.  Right now, I give this a 5.

There is a lot going on in this game, and a lot of depth that remains untouched after one incomplete game. Understanding how the buildings and staff work together to create combos is going to need a few more plays. The theme is novel, but it does nothing for me, not helped by the slightly dodgy art except the excellent cover. Overall, good but not spectacular. Needs more plays to see how good it can be.

One of my favorite games of 2011.  I've played it 4 times so far (3x in the first weekend).  We've played 3-player 3x and 4-player once.  It plays excellent across the player counts although the valuation of some buildings and of stars/money changes so much that it is almost like playing two different games.  Lots of tough decisions and multiple paths to victory.  Lots of different options about how to invest and where, although I think the basic strategy of "get lots of cubes and designs" is consistent across all the paths to victory.

RATING: 4
First play: Tough choices and many paths to victory. The rules lack clarity in places and the wording (style, design, etc) added to the confusion. There are also a lot of icons to learn and in common with many other games, they are too small to be easily read from across the table so it's hard to know exactly what trend/PR/quality markers each of your opponents will gain after a show. This is actually a pretty good game despite the slightly off-putting theme though maybe this will be a draw for female gamers.

Second play: I went into debt in the first quarter and from then on, the debt just piled up and I was never able to clear it. I hadn't realised just how unforgiving this game can be. If I play again I will be much more cautious when it comes to renting buildings and hiring staff. Only the most useful ones (i.e. cards that let you buy cheap cubes without a token, get more design cards without a token and reduce the management costs) should be taken and quickly upgraded for their maximum effect.

Comments after first play: I prepared so much to be able to teach this game properly and have a smooth first game. The teaching part went well, but it's inevitable, as rulebook is unclear at times (botched translation + mistakes) you'll make a few mistakes along the way AND you'll have to go back to the rules to check what the cards are and what they do exactly. This made the game drag... It was quite long. I know second game will be a lot better, but it'll be hard to convince my friends to invest so much time in another round of this one. We have too many great games to try/play already.

I was ready to love this game so much though since I do work in fashion and I love worker placement. I guess I expected more fun in less time and with less mathematic.

Also, I believe the game would be THAT MUCH MORE enjoyable if it had great artwork. It's litterally screaming for great visuals!! Let's be honest here, the board, cards, icons and actual fashion designs look outdated and that's certainly not how you want your fashion game to look! The whole rules and graphic design needs to be revised completely.

Nice, tight economic game. Worker placement and set collection to present designs at a year-end show. Players can hire contractors, construct buildings (departments), and hire employees that all contribute to the overall goal of producing and then presenting one or more fashion designs at four different shows in the game. 

Not much good to say about the rulebook, but I'm willing to put forth some work to figure out the questionable areas because it's that good of a game. This is a heavy game, rules-wise. Very difficult to grasp all the working parts, much like Vinhos was to me. It really helps to have someone who is *very* familiar with the game teach, as trying to learn it from the rulebook would be very challenging. And this was designed for the Bank of Poland in order to teach kids about money??!! 

The art is very good, the production materials are great, and there is cardboard instead of paper money. Bonus.

Heavy engine game of worker placement and cash-flow which very closely matches its theme.

The designer threw lots of interesting ideas into this game; in fact, too many. It's too long. You'll select from among 72 cards with special abilities over the course of the game. You'll keep many of these cards until the end, invoking their powers every round. The later rounds become tedious affairs as the players examine the numerous cards that they have accumulated and try to calculate their best moves.

Pret-A-Porter is a worker placement economic game that is about as heavy as Agricola.  This is normally a little too heavy for me, but I make a few exceptions when a game catches my fancy.  I like this one, probably because it simulates the start-up environment of an entrepreneur.  

There is a big problem with the English translation of the rules, and there are tons of icons to learn, so expect to take an extra hour getting through your first game.  As with most heavy games, this one can lead to some downtime because of how much there is to think about on a player's turn (read AP).  I am also a little worried about a run-away leader problem, but I have not played enough to know if this is a problem.

I have only played it with 2 players, so it will be interesting to see how it holds up with more.  I expect it will be even better!

Players are owners of a fashion house, trying to earn the most money from running their company for 12 months. Structurally simple game where players place three pawns out to claim actions, which pick up clothes designs, fabric cubes, as well as contract, building and employee cards.  Every third turn, fashion designs are presented at a show and earn stars, which inflate the sell back price.  So place pawns, finish clothes, present them to beef up the profits... easy.  However, the three decks of cards grant abilities, and this adds a lot of complexity to the game and decision space.  To complicate things further, the translation is confusing and a little inconsistent.   I suspect there is an excellent business game lurking in here, very much in the Vinhos style, if you are prepared to dig through and find it. Worth a look.

Ordered from the GamesKeep and received on 12/18/14.

Played 3 times.  Rating suffers a bit due to the horrible rulebook and how difficult it is to get started due to checking and re-checking the rules.  Once you remember what to do, it goes smoothly.  Super challenging economic game that is VERY thematically integrated in its options and actions.  I'd love to have a reprinted comprehensive rulebook that is clear on all its many confusing points (and I'm not alone in this feeling).  Brain melts tons while playing, so it's not a title I'd want to play consecutively or on consecutive days.  More like a once a month game, so as to not forget how to play.  Always enjoyable, tense, and interesting.  Just have to figure out how to beat my husband.  Initial rating after 3 plays a respectable 9.

Bloated. Cool theme but way too much going on from there. At its heart PaP is a set collection/WP game but there is simply way too much going on in the game to keep track of. Every card is complicated, icons are not too helpful, and I felt the gameplay was too complicated for what you ended up with. If you want a really modular, complicated worker placement game you may be pleased. 

I do have to add that I really liked the mechanic of brand value. That is an element that is often missing in economic games, but the way Pret a Porter handled it was really nice.

I liked the game, even though I had a rough start with the rules, which are not the best. Once you start playing everything falls on its place. This is a worker placement game in its core.

This game has a high replayability.

Awesome game! Lots of options, many paths to victory, long term strategy, and the cards really fit to the theme.

This is quite an interesting worker placement game that is an economic game at heart, even though the theme seems light (in this, I suspect it's like the fashion industry.)  I like it better than some similar games, like Vinhos.

The rules are hard to understand, though, and as far as I can tell, neither the designer nor the publisher has any interest in supporting the game.  I don't feel it's possible to play this game with any understanding of what the rules are supposed to be.

More of a standard Euro than the economic game I was looking forward to. The worker placement and infrastructure-building appear to be the most important parts of the game; perhaps there's something about debt levels in there too.

Anyway, the game is about pushing for pluralities every three rounds, and the limits imposed by the worker placement limit the snowball effect of having more money.

RATING: 6
Despite a fun theme, it feels very tired in terms of worker placement.  The long term-strategy failed to intrigue me such that I felt like I was just making tactical choices the whole game and clocking in over 3 hours that's pretty harsh.  Even at a 2 hour game, it would feel long to me.  Still, it's a very solid game.  I'd HIGHLY recommend it to those that truly love the worker placement genre.

Seems to be decent economic game but it is too much accountant-ish for my taste. Sit down, think 20 minutes, count everything, move. For people who like this kind of game it is must try! It seems that graphic designer hadn't heard anything about modern boardgames. After good and very good graphic designs from Portal it is a surprise for me!

RATING: 5
For a game that lasts several hours (I don't think anything shorter is reasonable for the first few plays) there is surprisingly little long-term planning in here. Almost every decision is tactical in nature and coupled with lots of very situational and fairly imbalanced cards the game simply takes far too long, and that situation certainly isn't helped by a less than helpful rulebook and lots of different and not exactly self-explanatory card powers.

Prêt-à-Porter is fiddly. There are more fiddly games around (like, say, Mage Knight) but the administrative overhead felt a lot bigger in this one, most likely because many of the effects aren't very intuitive with regards to the thematic integration. To a large degree you don't do stuff because it makes sense thematically, but because the mechanisms demand it or because "it's in the rules." Despite the unusual theme the game really doesn't provide anything new or different when compared to other worker placement games.

All of that is not to say the game is broken. With the exception of the imbalanced card powers it is solidly built. It does, however, resemble day labour a lot more than craftsmanship or even art. There may be a succinct statement about the fashion industry in there somewhere but it provides little reason to choose this game over the competition.

RATING: 9
Note: Rating ONLY applies to 4 player game, and using a modified turn order (strange disclaimers, I know).
  
Tight economic game using worker placement, card drafting, area majority, and set collection.  The gameplay video on BGG is long, but immensely helpful in learning the game.  The game tensions come together well and after a few plays, I feel there is a good amount of meat on this one.  I'm not sure the cards have enough variation for tons of replay, but I suspect this has many more plays left in it.  Oh, and bizarrely, it doesn't come with enough money to play a 4 player game....hopefully you own poker chips or don't mind writing down your scores for each show.

Follow-up: having played a few more games, I need to up the rating, provided the game is played with 4 players --3 is too imbalanced because of the importance of turn order early in the game.  Overall, it's a little more fiddly than my first plays --remembering how the cards work, and tracking everything, but it's more meaty than I first thought.  There's a lot of tension to cash flow, actions, card drafts, and the majorities that win stars, with a lot of chaos from turn-to-turn.

Follow-up 2: upped rating again.  Some of the fiddly can be overcome by simply writing down the stars from each player at each show and using chips instead of the tiny flippable counters.  I'm considering a modification to turn order based on balance questions (see forum thread "Turn order balance".  Have been using a Rochester style draft order (for season 1, comprising of turns 1 and 2, order is 1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1.)  Order rotates for each season.  If the standard rules are used, P4 is terribly handicapped.

If there were a 15 minute learning video, I think this game would be much better received.  I suspect a lot of negative comments come from the difficulty of picking up the rules while simultaneously having card questions come up.  PaP is a very solid 2 hour gamer's game that I've had great success introducing to other players.

Follow-up:
The game is already wearing, which means 2 things: the quality is not as good as appeared, and I'm playing it a lot.  I'd rather have a game I play a lot, so am upping the rating to a 9.

Taught the game several times at Origins 2012.  Game was well received by those that played it.  Needs an FAQ though.  Also, I'm more convinced that the turn order is not balanced.  See my thread in the general forum.

Family games usually have themes that are appealing to both man, woman (and kids). Gamers games for true geeks have (due to 90% men who play) cool themes like Fantasy (Dragons/Mages) or Sci-Fi (Starships) etc. So I really was surprised that a publisher takes on "Fashion" with a gamers game. Despite the women's (or gay) theme, our group gave it a try. The game is icon heavy but all in all the mechanics to interlock well and the theme seems not just pasted on. There is not much luck, but the part that is may screw you hardly. Some cards are better than others, so lucky you are when you are first player (or second). We had a few open questions to the rules/scoring but still it was an enjoyable evening.

Very well made cutthroat game in the world of fashion. 

I think this is a solid design, yet, it is a long game, in some parts somewhat fiddly (the star mechanic), and you got to calculate yourself to death. All things that I'm not absolutely thrilled about.

That said, if you like hard and cold euros, with tight money and cutthroat interactions, this game's for you. The game's particularly cruel at the beginning, but towards middle-and-end there are many ways to mitigate some of the pitfalls one may experience.

Three and a half hours of drudgery. Worker placement and searching out card combos are not my thing and the theme holds no appeal. I think what bumps it down from mediocre to bad is the rules, which seemed unnecessarily convoluted and which took more than an hour to parse. The unintuitive iconography is less than helpful. There are too many good games out there to bother with this.

RATING: 7
Yeah its close to an 8 for me so far after one play, it seems to be a very good strong themed strategic and tight economic euro game with a nice original theme and likely multiple paths. Its on the heavy side but maybe no more than Automobile, and the first game sees a brutal learning curve due to everything going on and the poor rule clarity regarding cards and such and having to look them all up due to icons (which could hopefully be further improved in a 3rd ed, and/or player aids could be made with text that does NOT require a magnifying glass to read!) which is a shame, because the core game itself is very straight-forward. 

I can imagine without the fan-made re-written rules and FAQ and playing with a 1st edition etc that many people's experience was completely ruined, and I can see why and it shows in the ratings. I was fully prepared for the game which is 2nd ed, which was still a PITA to prep but it turned out good mostly, less some of the cards which were not fully clarified. Once you get past the rules, you find a somewhat realistic game of what its like to run a business in the Fashion Industry.  

My one concern is balance issues, it seemed a couple things were way too good, accountants seem very good, a couple other things handing out stars also but in particular the Spokesperson paying out 2 stars every tie you get in seems WAY too powerful unless I have the rules wrong (maybe with 4 players it should be 1 star?). These things also mean that turn order can be very important (which is also where luck comes in and hopefully it balances out most times) and in the 3 player game its not equal turns going first so maybe there should be a small compensation for that. Well I also wonder if its a tad long too or even a full 1/4 too long, but having only played once this is hard to judge since we were getting much faster as we went, I could see fast groups playing 2 hours tops, slower groups likely 2.5 or 3 if playing with 4 players, all assuming rules are fully digested....

I think if it weren't for the highly original theme and how strong it is my rating could be a full point lower just due to the barrier to entry from rules and icons, but as it is I am glad to own the game and just wish it would have been easier to learn. 

[u]Update:[/u] 7.75 => 7 Got in two more plays. Unfortunately the game did not move any faster, between having to read out 9 new cards each turn and some book-keeping/fiddliness, it just moves a little too slow which is a shame as it is such an original theme for a game. Having the text ON the cards would help, as would more play of course but I am not sure these things would ever happen. Could hit trade pile not sure as apparently Dungeon Petz is same type of game but quicker (obviously different theme), only theme and wife are stopping it I think. Note though, if I play again I will only play THREE rounds, not 4 with 4 people as it runs too long. 

----

Read the rules and watched the walk through vid, this will be very close to an 8 for me, theme seems strong to me but its a pure Euro to be sure

Pret a Porter is a medium-heavy economic worker placement game. I really like it. This is the first game my GF has asked me to buy :D, at first I thought the theme wasn’t for me but, all things considered, I prefer the fashion theme over Agricola´s or Puerto Rico´s. 

You have only 2 months (6 plays) before each Fashion show so you have lots of tough decisions :devil: and as you know what the other players are doing you can try to screw them. I think the game is highly strategic as you know from the beginning where will be all the fashion shows and it has a low luck factor IF you are already familiar with the cards (otherwise the luck factor increases). A very tight game indeed.

On the bad side, the rules are awfully written, also the $10 bills are way too similar to the $100 bills so it is very easy to make a mistake with this. It would have been a nice thematic touch if you knew what the fabrics were (for example egyptian silk, cotton, etc.). 

I recommend It.

I have played Pret a Porter two more times. As I´m trying to get my ratings according to the BGG rating guide, I’m downgrading Pret a Porter`s rating to a 7.0. The reasons are 1. The game is too long for what it offers with the full complement of players, I don’t think I will play with 4 players again, I think its sweet spot is 3 players. 2. I usually want to play it but I don’t want to play it at all game sessions. 3. The $100 and $50 bills are too similar to the $10 and $5 counterparts, this has led to critical mistakes in our games.

However I still think it is a very good game with a fresh and different theme.

I still recommend It

Before Spiel 2011, I dismissed Pret-a-Porter on account of the length of the rules which are beyond what I usually accept for a worker placement Eurogame. But as there was a table available when I finished my game of City Tycoon, I gave it a try.

Bearing in mind my low expectations, this was a positive surprise. I'm not too fond of worker placement as a mechanism. It has a tendency to be repetitive and resolution of placement can get boring. Pret-a-Porter avoids this trap by many unique actions (drawn tiles) that can be chosen and will change from turn to turn. It definitely helped that we had a skilled game explainer from Portal that spared us the hassle of constantly browsing the manual. The explanation also mitigated the few rough corners that this game has (stars for the exhibition first provide additional money for each exhibition piece and one turn later they provide a second type of money that only counts at game end). I have one worry though: due to the multitude of different tiles they strongly differ in strength. As there's no way to influence turn order, there's the potential for lucky shots that could throw off the game balance.

I would call Pret-a-Porter 2011's Vinhos. Let's see if it will have a longer life span. For me, the points go to Pret-a-Porter. If I only could see playing it with some regularity which is necessary to get a flow into the game.

Very fun game with a fun theme as well: Fashion. Yes, capital F Fashion.

Gameplay is smooth but quite mathsy. So beware of AP-prone players or just people that prefer taking ages over their turns, calculating every action against every other possible action, just to get a few more points. Looking at you, Tim. So yeah, won't play this with some people.

Their seem to be some overpowered cards and combos but since they're good for everyone, regardless of what strategy you're pursuing, I find it hard to believe one player will be able to collect them all.

Lots of interesting cards. Excellent. Always love seeing new (and interesting) stuff in an exhausted genre.
Also really like how the stars make player counts feel very different. And by extension, quite a few of the cards as well.

Rulebook is ok. Certainly not terrible as some people told me.

I wasn't really even expecting to enjoy this one but as I've played other Portal designs decided to check this one out when the opportunity presented itself.  This game is very fiddly and you have to pay attention to details and what other people have as far as trend, PR, quality, etc.  Ties are brutal.  Still trying to figure out if the Spokesperson character is too powerful.  As the game only grants a person six actions before each show, it is imperative to make your actions work well together.  Taking an unexpected loan can be painful and you darn well better be able to pay it off by the end of the upcoming fashion show.  Luck of the draw in all the different types of cards can be frustrating - perhaps the most frustrating aspect of the game.  I'd like to say that it will even out over the course of the game and you can mitigate some of the problems, but I'm not sure if enough is done.

This is pretty much a straight-up economic engine game, with a few details added for the theme. For example, after your collection is shown you sell it, but the selling price is increased depending on how well you did in the show. Also, there are different markets from which you can buy your materials, and this affects the quality of your finished product. It's a very tight and unforgiving economic game that requires careful planning and resource management. Of course, it hasn’t gotten as much attention as it should because it’s about the fashion industry and therefore, you know, "gay". People who apparently have no problem playing a Renaissance merchant loading oranges onto a boat just can’t get into the theme in this game.

This is a medium-heavy economic game. It was supposedly designed in response to a contest to make a game that simulated business, and you can tell that's true. You really do feel you're running a business with small profit margins, initially trying to bootstrap yourself, and then reinvesting a lot of your money into a killer collection to make a huge amount of profit towards the end of the year.

The only downside to this game is how new cards come up every round, so it can lead to some card-reading fatigue (especially since the icons aren't the clearest thing in the world).

All in all, it's a fantastic game. It plays very differently from time to time and it tells a very different story every time. I'm always happy to play it.

Finally got this to the table after owning it for 6 years.  Very good economic game but runs fairly long.

For once, the mechanics actually worked very nicely with the theme.

RATING: 6
Another of this seasons games that has a high degree of randomness that's completely manageable. I think competent decision making is derived from small number of cards in the game and the fact that there is perfect information among the players themselves.

Pret teaches you to focus on a handful of scoring categories and specialize in your buildings and employees to be successful. Failure to do so will not only see you lose but struggle throughout the game. In the latter sense Pret can be very brutal and unforgiving.

Update:

Given it's length, and the inability to catch a distant leader, this game has regrettably fallen from grace.

RATING: 9
The game's economic system is incredibly heavy. You would think that a game about fashion would be light-family fun.  You would be wrong.  This game is difficult for gamers and you are looking at over 2 hour inventment to play it.  It is likely to go 3 hours.  The worker placement and resource management is very interesting.  Also the idea of expanding your buildings and employees is an interesting one.  I love the fashion shows and the cut-throat competition.  But I agree with Ignacy that he never should have used a fashion theme.  I tried to play this with my young girls 8 and 10 but we had to break it up over 2 days and I had to assist them throughout the game.  They were not keen to play again.  

Excellent game.  One of the better economic games out there but not family weight.

After two plays, I was feeling pretty enthusiastic about [i]Prêt-à-Porter[/i].  But after four games, my enthusiasm had began to wane.  Every game has had a runaway leader and it started to take the fun out of the fashion industry.  One bad turn can destroy any chances of ever catching up.  Since then, we've had a number of plays and most have ended up with an obvious winner.  Nevertheless, we're still playing it.

RATING: 8.5
Rating after one shorter test-session and one full 4-player game.
It is really good, rather heavy, economic game when you fully comprehended the rules. Unfortunately the rulebook is either poorly traslated or not completely worked through before publishing (or perhaps a combo of both). For me it took a couple of hours scanning through the rulesforum before I got the knack of them. Some of the components also leave some additional requirements like the size of the money, that make the game unneccessary fiddly. 

Exept from this it is actually a really good economic game with lots of tough decissions to make. There are seem to be several routes to score and possibillities to trade-offs between in investing in current show or hold designtypes for comming collections to maximze the outcome in stars from the shows. To do this you need to have a rather good insight in what you opponents do. As usual in economic woker placement games you do not have time to do everything you want and need to plan your actions depending on turn order. 

Most of the special cards offers rule-bending abilities that give oportunity for long time strategies as well as short term tactical decissions. 

The set-up is rather quick but there is alot going on in the game and before all players a aquitaned with rules and cards the game tends to drag out a bit in time as well. In short it is a gamers game played best with 3-4 experienced players.

It's ironic for a game with such theme to lack... elegance. It could really use some streamlining (or a computer version so that all the tedious constant bookeeping is done for you) and rulebook editing.
An average "worker placement to get resources to score VPs" just too bloated and long.

Great economic game. Advertised as a business simulator and it delivers. Thematically, the employees, buildings, and contracts work perfectly.

Highly recommended.

This is the heaviest game I have played in my young geekdom.  Like many, the theme didn't exactly excite me.  Rating would probably go up with more plays and familiarity, seems like having the cards' roles and powers memorized would give one a big leg up in this game.

RATING: 8.5
This one I was pretty excited to play... despite the very poorly written rulebook and the poor choice of iconography (and some errors were made due to this 2 things) that causes the game length to increase for a game that is already very long even when you are all experienced players!

I have to say it didn't disappoint at all... this one is an excellent economic game with a pretty cool unique theme.

But don't be fooled with the theme of the game, yes, you are the head of a Fashion Company and people might dismiss the game because of that, others might think it's a light game, etc... but this is a game of hard choices... a game of very strategical and carefully made decisions because if you looking at the board you don't think ahead and you just go with the gut feeling you'll find yourself without money and if you can't pay your maintenance costs you'll be forced to take a credit with some loan sharks that can be pretty damaging...

RATING: 8.6
This is a tough, tight economic game. You have so few actions that you need to be really precise in preparing a good line of clothes for each fashion show while also capitalizing on opportunities that come available for contracts, buildings and employees. However, there's no safety net in this game: if you over-invest in corporate expansion and go too deeply into debt, you can really sink yourself.  On the other hand, it is really rewarding to have a great show and bask in the wealth it brings in!

Game of the year 2011!
I've played this only twice but both plays have had me enamoured. I don't know if it's the quirky theme (maybe I'm a repressed Fashionista!) or it's the tight economy, or the worker placement (you only have 3 pawns!), or the cards... Somehow it just works for me (unlike my disappointments - see below). I haven't played Dungeon Petz but to me this is the" show" game of the year. The only drawback is both games have clocked 4 hours... which I suspect is due to unfamiliarity with the cards (all of them enter play) but I really want to get it on the table, like now!

Here come the hotstepper.

The illegitimate baby of Agricola and Caylus, set in the cutthroat world of high fashion, Pret-a-Porter forces tough decisions on you at each turn.  For a limited turn, Stefan Feld-style "too many choices, not enough time" game, Pret nails the feel with a quarterly fashion show designed to let players excel in one area while fighting it out for second in others.  The utterly brutal economic engine will make you work for every dollar you earn, and no matter how much you make it will never feel like you've got enough to win.

Pret keeps getting better the more I play it.  It ranks high on my 2011 list, higher than most, and certainly higher than 7 Wonders.  Get this game an American release.

Quite nice family game. One rule is totally broken (order of players on track with PR, quality, trend etc.) but it's easy to repair.
Also I'm a bit worried about card balance - some cards look much more stronger then other. On the other hand I have played only two "not so strong" cards and win game quite easy so maybe it's not so bad ;)
On it's core, it's a very simple game - buy resources to complete your orders. Cards add some twist.

心得:
卡片能力過多又只有圖示
第一次玩比較要花時間搞懂
基本上算是一個金錢流的遊戲
跟之前的prime time有點像
每幾個回合就要比一次各項指數
真的要算要贏人家會很累
所以weight就變重了
不過遊戲性基本上是還不錯
感覺最後就跟卡運有點關係(因為卡牌強度不一)
規則:
*契約/建築/員工卡把只有單面跟雙面的分開洗勻，單面的放在雙面的上面再放圖板對應位置，從底部發牌補滿圖板，時裝秀卡除了最後回合的四張其他洗勻在時裝秀的3個回合依序放1/2/3張，最後一個放最後的四張，月分標誌放在1
*每個人發兩張設計卡(必須沒有特殊符號且不同風格)，剩下的洗勻放圖板並開對應張數，每人拿40元，隨機起始，倒序選個人版，如果設計圖對應到個人圖板的類型就拿一個時尚標記放上面，每個人拿3個行動柱，跟兩個金額標記標成-3
*遊戲分12個月由2個準備月伴隨1個時裝秀月重複4次組成，每個準備月結束都會起始玩家
*準備月分四階段
1.玩家由起始開始輪流擺行動柱，一定要從最左邊開始擺，借貸區無擺放上限
2.行動執行 依數字每個區域在按箭頭順序執行，不須放工人的照起始順序執行
>銀行 每一組一樣風格為一個組合可每張可借貸10元一次，並調整維持費用為借貸費的10%
>契約卡 拿了放圖板旁直到下個時裝秀結束
>建築卡 付左上費用，並根據右上調整維持費用
>雇用卡 覆蓋下放空格，並調整維持費用，如果下方三格都用完可放到建築卡下方，可付兩倍維持費用解雇他
>設計卡 拿一張，如果有隨機拿能力則先照行動柱在此的順位暗抽，沒放行動柱的則等所有人拿完再拿，上面有兩個需求資源就算完成
>在地工廠 一個行動柱可選一個資源買任意個並獲得1個品質標記

3.訓練發展階段 可選擇一個職員跟一個建築付下面金額升級翻面，可能要調整維持費用
4.維持階段 支付維持費用，清空所有場上卡牌開心的，最後一季從最上面開新的並推進月份一格
*時裝秀月分5階段
1.每個之前拿到的星2/3/4人換成1/2/3元，這邊拿的錢用金色面算是品牌價值，不能花，最後算分，然後星棄掉
2.選擇一組風格的所有完成設計卡參賽
3.根據這個月份的時裝秀卡評比拿星，第1/2/3/4次只評比前4/3/2/1項，第一名根據項次依序拿4/3/2/1星，第二名則在2/3/4人時拿1/211/221分，平手一起降一名，該評比項目如果完全沒有就不能拿星
4.賣作品，根據卡片上價格加上設計卡數量乘所有星拿錢
5.維持 付維持費用之後必須盡量還借貸，所有沒延展的契約卡棄掉
*最後一個時裝秀同上只是最後星也換錢，並結算所有的錢最多的獲勝
*借貸為任何時候前不夠用可拿20，也要付利息，且還的時候要還28，如果時裝秀後信貸或借貸還不出來就要拿扣10分標記，每一筆一個

Was there a theme? I didn't notice once I started playing, being focused on the pure worker placement mechanics of buying cards to build my engine, collecting contracts to build, buying the resources needed to fulfil the contracts, and competing after every 2 turns to see who could deliver the most contracts, collect the most trendy chips, the most PR chips and the most quality chips (each of which are mostly a function of engine building cards and leftover actions). Repeat that 4 times, which felt 1 time too many, but gives any snowball engine more chance to keep gleaning its benefit I guess. Most things hung together nicely. There were a few bits and pieces which felt extraneous (the star system for one), and the icons on the cards weren't obvious on first glance and all needed to be looked up, which made for a slowish first play. Overall it was decent and engaging but without making me want to push for a replay - I felt I'd explored it after a game, as weighing up the pros and cons of each card was fairly calculatable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Based on one play: Don't let the theme fool you, this is a worker placement game and a fairly good one. The goal is clear to see, but there are many routes to victory as you can get points a lot of ways. The fashion show where you present your clothing line scores based on up to four criteria and as you move through the rounds you have more and more to manage. The last round is fairly heavy and can turn off some as the start is much lighter, but if you like worker placement, the game is very good.

This is a heavy economic game featuring multi-stage production that reminds me a little of Vinhos.  Here, you're trying to assemble the best (according to a number of changing but known criteria) line of clothing in a number of fashion shows.  This turns into money, either of the usable type with which you can invest in more equipment, or end-game money which only counts at the end (most money wins).  Where this game is different is in the drafting (via worker selection) of cards, which give players special abilities, but also cost players money in the form of upkeep.  There's definitely a lot going on here, and despite it's glamorous theme, it'll probably only appeal to hardcore business game fans.

Heavy Economic game. Set collection and worker placement. There is a lot to take in and consider. I didn't expect to love it- and I didn't love it. 

I found it OK. I would play again if asked and in the right mood. It is a LONG game. 3 hours for 3 players. I don't suspect it gets much faster with more plays. 

It won't be for everyone- but it was definitely good to consider the options.

A fun game with a nice theme. My biggest gripe with it is that having a large collection seems to be too profitable, making getting a large collection a dominant strategy in a game that suggests there should be more paths to victory. (This might be group think at work.) It also means that being lucky and drawing matching designs has a large impact.

The rulebook isn't great, and the icons on the cards also cause some confusion, meaning that you often have to check the rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very interesting and deep economics game. The rulebook is written so poorly it's completely valueless. Be sure to download the rules written properly from BGG before even trying to play.

The game has three main areas. Build your business, grab new designs, and buy materials. You get two rounds of three actions each to prepare for the scoring rounds, and in each scoring round points are given to the players who are best in one of four scoring categories.

The game might have run-away leader issues, as there is no catchup mechanic other than just doing better in the future.

Interesting mechanic of trying to maximize a collection for income while at the same time maximizing other parameters for bonuses.  The number of designs seems to be such that all will be turned up at some point in the game so knowledge of the available designs is likely to make for a more competitive game rather than relying on "luck of the draw" to get good collections to show.

A bit concerned about 3P games and the 8 prep turns meaning that not all players will have equal chances at each position in the turn order.

Portal makes an economic worker placement game about the fashion industry, with art of women in pretty dresses instead of zombies and mutants shooting each other?! :)

Played once at Pionek 2010-12-04, and we enjoyed it a lot. Good serious game, well worth checking out. We hope to play more, even though the Polish card text slowed me down a lot. But I think with more experience I will know the cards pretty easily anyway. As usual in a game with lots of cards with special actions (especially from Portal) there are various murky rule ambiguities...

Played several more times and continued to enjoy, although it's longer and more complex than my preferred type these days (and has that element of "everyone has various special cards that do special stuff in their tableau and you should keep it all in mind if you want to play well" which I find I'm not so fond of, e.g. in extreme cases like La Havre). But the core system works fine and is enjoyable.

The 2011 Essen release version apparently improves the rules, definitely improves the board layout problems, and supposedly makes the cards non-text-dependent with icons which clearly represent what they do. I've not tried this version yet but heard positive comments from some who have.

--Dec2011-- Rules: clunky; incomplete; not particularly good for looking up concepts.  Game: held back a bit by "So what does this card do, then?" but, in the end, thematic and charming.  I'd expect a second play to take about half the 3h of our first attempt.
It could easily go up in rating, though:  provided that a reasonable selection of the card choices are viable (something that's not clear; some of them look much stronger than others.)

I really enjoy the theme - very Project Runway-like.  The rulebook is a travesty and even the cleaned-up version on here still leaves some holes.  It's the kind of game that was made way more complicated than it had to be and the terrible rule set certainly affected how approachable it is to even a mid-level gamer.  Quite a bit seems to hinge on the final run of shows too.  If you can get past the rules issues and the un-intuitive iconography, there is a fun experience under there.

We played a few rounds and actually got the rules explained from the designer himself. I'd say it is complex in a not exactly positive way, somewhat similar to Greed. In other words, there are 24 completely different contract cards, 24 completely different worker cards, and 24 completely different factory cards. And you don't know in what order they will come up, so you can't really plan your strategy much ahead. Then you want to collect sets of the same "fashion line", but again, you have no influence or knowledge about the order in which they will come up. So if the colour you are collecting just doesn't come up, you're screwed. Of course, you only get 24 actions in the entire game, so who cares if you can't actually use some of those because the cards you need don't come up, and you don't have money to buy stuff, and taking loans takes actions, and how much loan you can get with one action depends on how big your biggest fashion line is. Oh, did I mention that this depends on collecting cards that might or might not come up?

There seems to be something like an "emergency loan" that was obviously designed solely in case that someone is unable to count to ten and doesn't have the money to pay salaries at the end of the turn. The designer seemed genuinely perplexed when I asked whether I am allowed to intentionally spend more than I have and take such a loan. But you know, I still have the feeling that paying 8 money for one extra action is absolutely worth it.

In case it was not obvious, you are unlikely to see me playing this ever again.

Worker Placement, Economic. Rating after one play. This is a very tight Euro game, with not enough money to do everything you want while placing just 3 workers each round. There are only 8 rounds of actions (as the last month of each quarter is just scoring the fashion shows), adding to the pressure.

We all enjoyed it, but got off to a rocky start due to the rulebook. The game is somewhat icon-heavy, but mainly it was getting through setup and the first few turns that were frustrating. For example, the rulebook and aid sheet have descriptions of all the cards, but they aren't in alphabetical order so you have to hunt for the one you need (I suspect they were in alpha order in Polish, but weren't re-sorted in English?).

In the end, I think we only got a couple rules wrong and I really look forward to playing/teaching the game now that I know how it goes. It's a great game once you learn it.

Traded. Realized my wife was never going to try it and it's somewhat difficult to teach.

Overly long, and repetitive worker placement game.  I like all the super powers and upgrades, but many of the cards are tactically circumstantial, while others are just obscenely good (namely the tying on every single scoring).  There are just better games that do the same type of thing quicker.

Did I mention that: holy crap this is a long game for what it is? 

All in all it just doesn't feel finished.  It is clunky and unbalanced.  Did it really need the first scoring round?

The BGG entry says language dependance; no necessary in game text. However the smaller cards have Polish text on, though as we haven't played it, we dont know if that is important.
Rules are in Polish, so English rules would (presumably) need downloading.

This is a worker placement game about managing a fashion company.  My wife quite enjoyed loudly reminding me and my entire game group that I own two games about dress making (the other being Rococo which I quite enjoy!).

This is actually a very deep economic and resource management game.  The game is split up into 12 rounds, representing months of the year, and every 3rd month you present your dress collection at a fashion show.  During these quarterly fashion shows you do not get to play through the worker placement step so all your resource collection and preparation needs to be complete in two turns and each player only has 3 workers to place during these turns.

Resources are very tight and the cost of taking a credit or a personal loan is high.  This makes the game incredibly unforgiving to mistakes.  Each subsequent quarter there is one more fashion show than the previous quarter so there are more scoring opportunities but losing big in one quarter and you can find yourself in a financial hole, unable to scramble out.  In my first game even with my opponent winning first in 3 out of 4 of the final 4 fashion shows he finished with 23 points and I finished with over 270.

The game is actually incredibly deep requiring your constant attention but the formula is also incredibly simple.  Place workers, carry out actions, pay costs.  Then during fashion shows you present your collection and receive points (stars).  Some rules are unnecessarily convoluted, I think.  Like the way stars are handed out when scoring fashion shows, but then turn into "golden dollars" at the beginning of next year's fashion show, then there are also cards that provide you with additional stars that you don't know what to do with.

My two biggest gripes are that even though there are lots of options for varying up your play of the game with contracts, employees, and buildings...there isn't, really.  There are many copies of different contracts, employees, and buildings and different ones can still do very similar things or even the same thing across different card types.  Also, you play through the entire deck each game so you see the same exact 36 cards each game.  And finally, the rulebook is AWFUL!  There are rules completely absent, descriptions have very little illustrations to show you what they are talking about, and some terminology is incorrectly used interchangeably or simply wrong.  I don't even think these are all mistakes with language translation, some things you just don't do like omit illustrations, especially with game setup.  Publishers, always have an illustration to accompany game setup.

This is another game I'm still looking forward to playing with more than 2.  It plays up to 4 and the number of available spaces increases with player count but not the number of cards set out each turn so more players means much more cutthroat competition.  With 2 there was occasionally a time when we were competing over a specific card but not that often.  Especially since, like I said, there are many copies of the same card in each deck.  I think this is an incredibly designed game with some real depth to it but ultimately not one that excites me, we will see how I feel once I play with more people.

RATING: N/A
Here's an economic game with a few good ideas but that gets lost in all of the details provided by the cards. Each special card makes part of a plan, which is good because they help players's strategies, but they also have small resolution details and mainly they are executed out of players's main turns, which drags the game play and changes the course of the game in a bad way, IMO. It's one of those games in which the solution is also part of the problem because cards add complexity and strategy but they also add chaos, mess, downtime and confusion.
As an economic experience it really seems unbalanced. Strategies seem more obvious for everyone now, of course, but they also seem too obvious.

Now here's how to take worker placement and turn it into something other than a resource conversion engine builder. Though mechanically straightforward, it's a much heavier game than it first appears. You really have to plan things out several turns in advance or you'll get left in the dust.

This is a terrific game and it's absolutely criminal people are turned off by the theme, which absolutely shines in this game. 

Worth noting that the game is way, way longer than BGG would have you believe. 2.5-3 hours is much closer to the actual playing time.

I expect Portal will blow the re-theme of this much in the same way they screwed up First Martians. If you can get your hands on a copy of the original, it's worth the effort.

The Good
Complex strategy game with lots to do and limited actions. There are so many different strategies and card combinations to try that it's either overwhelming or a guarantee of replayability, depending on how you see it. 

The Bad
The rules! There are holes in the rules and official FAQ doesn't seem to address all questions printed in it, not explicitly anyway. Personal minus for me is that it's a bit mathy. But I suck at math, so if you have no trouble with Power Grid or Scepter of Zavandor, you won't have any trouble with Prêt-à-Porter either.

The Beautiful
The theme! So nice to have a fresh theme after shipping a bunch of stuff and building various buildings in medieval cities.

Although the cards are well designed and this game offers plenty of engaging decisions from start to finish, it may be too much of a good thing. Our complete 3-player learning game took 4 hours, mainly to read the operation instructions on the legion of cards to be acquired, front and back. Elegance has been thrown to the curb, and the multitude of choices each turn encourages AP. This is my type of game (economic, worker placement), but this one will likely scare all but the hardcore gamers away.

About [thing=87890][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=87890][/thing], as said in its presentation, is an economic strategy game set in a world of fashion. Players run clothes companies and fight for dominance during fashion shows. During the game players open new branches and outlets, hire new workers and try to gain new capabilities. New Design Agencies, Brand stores or Preparation rooms are opened, Accountants, Models and Designers are hired, lucrative contracts are sign to allow for short-term profits and expand company’s competencies.

[thing=87890][/thing] makes an interesting mix of work placement and building an engine (your company), struggling to manage not only to put up a nice line of clothes for the fashions shows, but also accomplish this while controlling expanses, since keeping a compnay running and buying fabric isn't cheap. And the loans are looming over with a promise of money, which will become a bigger hole later.

It isn't easy to stay fashionable in today's world.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Everyone starts with some money, which they will spend to pay for workers, build and keep buildings, and buy fabric to create the clothes for the fashion shows.

The game lasts for 12 rounds, and in the 3, 6, 9 and 12th, there will be fashion shows. Those will give stars for the players that have more of something that is more important in the given shows: it can be Quality, or PR, or Quantity or Trending. For the first phase (1 show), all 4 will be scored. For the second (2 shows) it will be scored the first three items shown in the city card. In the third (3 shows), only the first and second items. And in the last round of shows (4 shows), only the first item will be scored in each city.

Therefore, say that Quality was big in the first show of the season. But can now be only in third place in one of the two next cities and not even score in the other, returning to shine again in the third phase of shows. This means that players must manage their Quality "income" to match the needs of the shows. And this is valid for each of the four items evaluated.

In the rounds between the shows, players will use 3 pawns to:
- acquire "power" cards (contracts, which have a shorter duration; workers, that enter in the payroll; and new capabilitie/buildings, which cost money to "activate" and, afterwards, have a cost to sustain) - these cards have all kinds of effects: earning PR, Trending, Quality tokens, making you gain money, bringing extra clothes, and so many other things;
- take clothe cards (which is what players are trying to make);
- buy fabric (one spot allow to buy any amount of one color of cube; other allow to buy at the most one cube of each color; and the third spot allow the same as the first - any number of one type of cube -, but of higher Quality - and each spot give Quality tokens - the first one, the second two, and the third, three);
- to get $5 money, or one Trending or PR, or 2 Quality tokens;
- finally, is possible to use pawns to take loans, which charge monthly interest.

The spots on the board are activated in order: first the Loan, then the Power cards (contract first, abilities next and, in the end, workers), then the Clothes cards, passing to buying fabric and ending the round with the tokens and/or the money.

All clothes require two colors of cubes to be completed. After two full rounds of using pawns, there is a round of fashion shows. Players must decide which clothes to take to the shows. Only one type of clothes can be taken (this will be your line for the season) - different types of clothes doesn't naturally mix (there are cards that allow this). After the stars were awarded for each aspect of value in the show (those that I mentioned earlier: Quality, Quantity, Trending and PR), players will get money selling their clothes: the value written on the cards of the clothes of the line + the number of clothes x the number of stars received. For instance: say I sold three clothes, one worth 17, other 17 and other 26, and gained 10 stars. So I have $60 for the clothes, than 3 (number of clothes sold) x 10 (stars) = $90 total.

In the next round of shows, the stars I received in the former shows will be transformed in money, in the basis of 1 to 3 (so I would get $30 with my 10 stars). However, this money stays separately and will only count in the game's end.

And the game ends after 12 rounds (8 actions rounds, 4 rounds of shows). The player with the most money will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Oh, so many. The first three will be: where to position the pawns. The spots in each area are limited, and, not only this, the first to go somewhere gets to pick first (in the fabric purchase this doesn't really matter), except in the last place, where you get tokens, as there the order is the inverse.

Second, in each area, you will have to choose what to get. Even in the loans you get options of value. To you will need to consider what the cards do, the value to keep them (except for contracts), what is required to make them (for clothes) and of which type they are. Then what fabric (cubes) to buy, not only to make the clothes you already have, but might be worth to spend a little and advance. Money is tight, and without some cards, you will only get more once every three rounds, so the calculations must be precise.

When you already have workers and buildings, you can choose to upgrade them - they will cost more to mantain, but will also give a better bonus/ability.

And this is all made considering what the others are doing. Not that you must have an hawk eye all the time, but is very important to keep track of how much, in each aspect (quality, trending, quantity and PR) the other players have or will have, as winning in these aspects during the fashions shows is key to win the game, and you won't be able to overcame someone on the fly, only with careful preparation.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Highly strategic, but with enough randomness in order to prevent much AP and keeps the replay value high;
- So many possibilities of combos, since there are loads of different effects in the three types of "power" cards;
- Allows for different paths to victory - doing well in the fashion shows is important, but the "machine" behind (how much you are spending each round) also counts a great deal.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Basically all the interaction in the game is indirect (which many appreciate more), keeping in the blocking spots, taking what someone else wants and being ahead in the aspects judged in the fashion  cities;
- The manual for the game is seriously lacking in so many points it isn't even funny;
- Which leads to a FAQ that is bigger than most manuals of other games;
- The flow of the game is clunky: during the action rounds, 9 "power" cards will be revealed each round, and there is the constant need to lose time explaining most of them, as the iconography alone doesn't do the job (and is necessary to confirm with the FAQ what they can and can't do). Also, after the fashion shows, the calculations, though not much complex, stops the game and is prone to mistakes;
- The iconography is small and is difficult to see what others have on the other side of the table, and even to look at the cards available and see and understand what they do on a glance.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like in a fierce competition - not to sell, but to excel. Everyone will sell clothes during the fashion shows. If you made it and you took it there, it will be sold. There are even no dispute in prices - you skirt could cost twice the price of someone else, and you will gain 100% of the price of it. Selling isn't the issue. Excel is. Every city in the fashion show circle has a demand, and the goal is to meet it in the best way possible. Mind you that selling is important, I just mean that there isn't a challenge to sell once the clothe is done (you have the fabric/cubes for it).

The heart of emotion, tension and dispute of [thing=87890][/thing] is in gaining the stars. The stars not only will earn you money for the game end and increase the amount received on the fashion show, but also will provide the feeling of achievement - is the true measure of success. Sadly, the person that gains the most stars isn't necessarily the one that will win - it would be neat if is was, and the money gained from sales would only help in keeping the machine going. Fame would be the goal. As it is, you want be Nike, Old Navy or Gap, instead of Armani, Karan or Versace.

[thing=87890][/thing] has is problems, most coming from the terrible manual, which make the players lose trust if what they are doing it right, and from the iconography, that crushes the flow of the game, making start of a new round a slog, as players try to decipher the meaning of the 9 cards - adding around 5 minutes 9 times during the game, which is almost a crime. This is something that will be lessened with constant play, but, come on, very few groups can sustain constant play of a single title to the point to make dozens of special cards intuitive to a simple look.

In the end, [thing=87890][/thing] is a good game, one that is unique and charming, and works pretty well, when it is flowing. Too bad most of these are hidden somewhere in the veritable booklet of FAQ. Still, I recommend it for those looking for a solid economic and work placement game, with indirect interaction, smart and tight gameplay, and with a theme that works enough to not be called "glued on". During the parts that weren't counting and uncovering meanings in the aids and FAQ, I liked [thing=87890][/thing].

Pret-a-Porter is an economic strategy game set in a world of fashion. Players run clothes companies and fight for dominance during fashion shows. It is – perhaps – one of the most cruel and ruthless of all our games. Money can be a dangerous weapon.
During the game players open new branches and outlets, hire new workers and try to gain new capabilities. New Design Agencies, Brand stores or Preparation rooms are opened, Accountants, Models and Designers are hired, lucrative contracts are sign to allow for short-term profits and expand company’s competencies.
Every single month player’s company gains new capabilities.
Each quarter held fashion shows – each player has to prepare a collection of clothing and has to show it on the show. The public, media, experts estimate collections in four categories and award prizes and diplomas. The more awards (represented by ‘stars’ in the game) will be collected at the show, the more money the players earn for selling their collection!
Will you get award for best Trends? Will you manage to be best in Public Relations and get the Media award? Will you earn more ‘stars’ than your opponent?

This is a solid economic game. I'm not sure that it is better or worse than any of the other examples out there, so the only thing that will really dictate if it needs to be in a collection or not is its unique theme. Gameplay is straight forward worker placement, but it leans pretty heavily on language independent iconography, which significantly slows down the game unless you manage to get it into regular circulation on game night. Most of the cards have unique powers, so the crib sheet for translating the symbols might as well be a whole other rulebook. As with most games of this ilk, with multiple plays that would go away, but I'm not sure if this game is different enough to make me want to play it all that often.

Genuinely enjoyable worker placement game where the theme consistently shines through the mechanics. The translation of the rulebook is a little unclear in a few places, but overall the symbols used are straightforward and the diverse game strategies keeps things interesting.

I'm normally not a big fan of the Euro worker-placement genre, but I'm really glad I bought this game. It's so refreshing to play a game that's not about farming, trading or building a castle.

The theme is so unique and rare, and I really like how it's handled and presented. There's a part of me that wants to support almost any game that isn't another 18xx/Renaissance, trading/resource management, fantasy/sci- fi game (though here's to more sci- fi games damnit!)

I like all of those things, but there are just so many of them. I like that the theme of fashion here works really well and how easy it is to really get into planning, constructing and presenting.

Portal Games convinced me, yet again, after just one play how good they are! A wonderfull mix between economics and workerplacement. You can only perform six actions before showtime, which creates a good kind of tension. Constantly counting and calculating which action will leave you with the most profit! Only downside, yet again, that damned rulebook. The last couple of years they worked hard on that issue, but this one is a hard nut to crack! But once you struggled yourselve through the rules, a rough diamond appears for you to polish into an 18-karrat game! ... and I sooo want to polish this!!!

Ignacy Trzewiczek was kind enough to take my brother, Daniel and I through a 3-player demo of this game at SPIEL '11, and that was enough for me to fall in love with the game. Immediately after finishing the demo I bought a signed copy.

It is a very tight economical worker placement game, and very strategic in play. Sure, you may have to change tactics based on your opponents' moves, but given the fact that the year's full schedule of shows and what features they reward are displayed at the start of the game provide you with an excellent base for a highly strategic game. I highly recommend Prêt-à-Porter!

Playing this game makes me feel like I'm operating my own company, and I love how wildly different strategies can succeed in the game. I've seen a high risk, high reward play go tit for tat with an opposite strategy that focused on keeping down costs - great fun and a fantastic business simulation!

Note that you don't need to worry about this game being language dependent, apart from card titles there is nothing but icons and numbers on its many cards.

However, the rules are the usual hot mess that Portal usually serves up, full of hard to understand and awkward use of the English language. There are some god documents in the files section that helps in this regards, and after a few plays you understand what's meant even if the rules make it sound much more complicated.

One very important point. I adore the game, but not as a three player game. There are eight Preparation Months in the game, that is the rounds in which you employ the worker placement mechanism. The first player is determined randomly to start and then rotate one player to the left at the end of each Preparation Month. Unfortunately, getting to go first is highly important in this game, and in a three player game, one player will only get to go first twice, while the other two players do it thrice each. That becomes a severe disadvantage in competitive games.

Still, the game is amazing with four players, and good with two, however I'd rather pass on it with just three players.

What a nice, intricate game, with [b]plenty[/b] of interaction between the cards you can get into play!  I strongly recommend forcing your players to use the little chits that indicate how much PR, Quality, and/or Trendiness they have, going into the show.  The competition is a bit unfair if people have to ask all the time, and it slows the game down.  Nonetheless, there are a ton of moving parts in the game, but few actions with few workers, which is a delight.  One unfortunate part is that you do have to do a bit of gambling when placing your workers, and just one bad gamble wastes 33% of a round's actions.  When you have only 24 actions in the game, that's a lot.  A number of aspects of this game remind me of [thing=42052][/thing], but the gambles in that game are fewer — by which I mean that it's basically only vying for the endgame that involves placing workers (barrels, in that case) that might end up being useless.  It does sting in Vinhos, too, though.  The difference is that you probably had chances to use them for other purposes before then.  [shrug]  I look forward to playing Prêt-à-Porter more.  I dig a game in which you can waste 50% of the game in a huge deficit, but come back to second place… even if it is only a little over half of first place.  :gulp:

Bardzo przyjemna gra ekonomiczna (acz nowa (angielska niestety) edycja znacząco poprawia zrównoważenie). Acz bardzo brzydka jak na grę o modzie ;)

This and Dungeon Petz are my favorite Euro games but the typical Euro crowd doesn't like games this heavy (and it isn't THAT heavy).

Too long for what is essentially un-fun tedium. Sorry.

A lot of downtime. Rulebook sucks. And cards not readable enough. But that was after first game. Maybe I'll give a new try in the near future ...

This is a very good game.  In my experience, there isn't as much tension when playing it two-player, which is my only complaint about the game; however, for three or four players, it's quite good.  

You need to be constantly aware of which features your opponents are pursuing and stay abreast and/or exceed as many of them as possible.  The theme is unique and refreshing, and I enjoy the accounting and resource management.

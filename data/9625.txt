Phew! Where to start. A grand scale game that plays quickly compared to others of this nature. The many mechanisms fit so well together. The game appears to scale very well between 2 & 7 players. Mutliple playings should be rewarded by new and interesting situations and approaches. However, I am becoming increasingly tired of some of the fiddly rules which don't really add anything to the game and it would have been nice to see those developed out. Rating is dropping (originally an 8). The alliance mechanism is still excellent however.

RATING: 7.5
Relatively straightforward gameplay with limited actions, but there are many possibilities to consider.  Seems to be a game that only works well with even numbers of players.  It would have been nice to use another mechanic other than dice-rolling, but the game is good enough to easily overcome this limitation.

RATING: 9.5
Sublime!  Sophisticated, deep, multi-layered and brain-burning. Love it!

The Alliance structure makes it close all the way through and there is enough variation in the tiles to keep every game fresh.

It is interesting to compare my feelings about this game and it's brother in depth - AoS.  I can admire and appreciate AoS, but love SoE.  For me, AoS is a clever game for accountants, SoE a clever game for adventurers and fighters.

SoE plays well from 4 up, but really it's with 5 and more that it shines - and odd numbers work best of all.  Don't expect a short game though -  this one lasts between 3 and 4 hours.

RATING: 9
Rating of 9 based on one play, but this game earns every point. The bidding for shifting alliances is pure genius. Typical Wallace management of negative attributes, which I love.

UPDATE: After some thought following a second play, I'm lowering my rating a point to 8. I love it, but the game is just soul-crushing, and because of that I can't see wanting to play too often. Still, amazing design. The rules for crossing the rope are inspired.

UPDATE2 (Dec '13): Back to 9 after play No. 3. I did terribly, but had a great time playing. It's a clever game.

This game got its moments. The mechanic works nicely and the theme fits the game well. It is possible, however, to be cut off from winning pretty early in the game if you have a streak of bad luck. The dice system for solving combat is not that bad, but its not that great either. Personally I get the feeling that I am a part of the struggle between 16th century great powers, when playing this game, and that makes a game fun in my book.

Enjoyable, very tense, strategic, and tactical.  I like it but it's a little long for me (3-4 hours).  Also, bad dice can make it difficult to win.  All things considered, it's a good game, although one I'd probably not purchase.  Definitely not a family game.

I like this game a lot, but usually it runs too long.  The rules are a bit complex, and unless you play it a lot, you're going to spend a lot of time looking things up.  Luck is a strong factor as combat is decided partially by dice roles.  It's a good game, but I prefer Liberte and other Wallace titles that give you the same rush without dragging on twice as long.

RATING: 8.5
A very well-done game. Some horribly fiddly movement rules aside, it's easy to understand and there's quite a lot of action. Because armies can move around the board so quickly, I always feel as though I'm walking a tightrope halfway through. Refreshingly different feeling than El Grande (to which it is oddly similar), which certainly isn't static but feels more constrained.
Unsure if the odd dice rules are a problem or not - as others have noted, there are typically one or two critical rolls throughout the game and luck can play a major role. So to speak.

RATING: 3.7
:cry::snore::snore::snore::snore::snore::snore: This rating is really more about my nearly non-existent desire to ever play this again (another bummer, as I was fairly interested in trying it). I mean, it's probably a good game, but a lot of times I don't really "get" Martin Wallace games or his style. It felt more like work than play, went on way too long for what it was (almost an hour of rules, plus 90 minutes for one war with six people), and just had too many things going on in too many directions for me to enjoy it. You probably need to already know the rules and tiles to enjoy it, and I don't think it's particularly worth the investment. We scored the endgame after one war. I think I was third or fourth, despite being the only one to lose a ship and getting clocked out of South America. The exception is that I might be convinced to like it as 2P, as then it would be a regular 1v1 wargame, which I grok better than this kind of wild, non-linear free-for-all. However, I also suspect that approximately nobody who actually owns this would WANT to play it as a 2P, because presumably it's intended to be in the multiplayer wargame genre, and there are already better 2P wargames anyway.

RATING: 6
There are some Euro games, where you feel that the theme is just tacked on, and it doesnt feel immersive.  In others, the theme and mecahnics match perfectly, and you really feel engrossed in the play of the game.

Then there is Struggle of Empires, where the game is as realistic as possible in the execution of its Slavery mechanic.  It really makes you feel like you aredeveloping navies off the coast of africa, shipping slaves off to plantations in north america.  Never let it be said that this game lacks in theme!  It does a great job of making you feel like an absolute piece of shit, destroying the lives of all these lesser peons, all those poor folks in the world who had the misfortune to be born with less privilege.

RATING: 8
Brilliant game. The randomness of dice rolling is decreased due to the fact that the two rolls will be compared. On top of that you can easily influence on what you are trying to attack by increasing your odds. A good light strategic wargame with economic influence. I did almost overlook it.

Interesting little game. The game always seems to go for way too long, but [i]if you have the patience and willingness to keep at it,[/i] there is a lot to be liked here. (Unfortunately, I don't have the patience for it.)

The unrest mechanic is the sword of Damocles, and the Alliance mechanism is evil -- in a good way. I am confident that once a group masters the rules and has a better sense of what to do (and how to accomplish it), the game will be shorter and may see more play.

Played 2/3 game with 6 and then 5 players. The alliance mechanic is very cool. 

Played 1/3 game with 7 players over 5 hours. The alliance mechanism slows down the game since alliance members have the option to assist on attack/defense, and the discussion/decision to assist doesn't happen until a player has committed to the action during their turn. 

Overall, the gaming group finds the game too dry, long, and very AP-prone. There are tons of options and the mechanic are neat, but other than that too long of a game to finish. 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Great, great game. Plenty of tough decisions and you always wish you could have one more action. Incredible theme sucks you into the era with shifting alliances and the constant tension of trying to expand while keeping the economic/population/unrest forces at bay. Just enough luck with dice rolls and placement of country markers at the start of each war to make things interesting, but not enough to offset the skill and planning of the players. Tons of replayability with the large number of tiles, and random country markers to convert to control.

Hitherto, I've either found fault with Martin Wallace's games or they have not been to my taste.  In my view Struggle is pretty close to faultless.  As ever, there are lots of clever mechanics; the alliance auction, improvement and ally tiles, the threat of unrest, the need to balance areas earning income and victory points.  In Struggle they all mesh together really well.  I gripe about downtime in turn-based games with many options.  It feels less of an issue with Struggle because you will want to keep a close eye on your opponents' actions.

RATING: 7
First play was 3p, which is strongly influenced by the 2v1 alliance that happens every turn, and the necessity to ensure everyone is the "1" for one of the three wars. Interesting system, would certainly play again, interested to try 4 or 5. The key with battles seems to be to only fight when the odds are heavily on your side-- don't go in and hope to roll well, as the costs to engage are high.

Wonderful depth.  A light wargame, to be sure, but there's nothing here that would be hard to teach to any gamer.  Some may not like the depth or some of the historical themes but I foud this wonderfully done.  I originally bought this with the intention of trading it but when I opened and played it, it immediately came off my list of games for trade.

RATING: 6
This is a decent dice throwing war game.  You could do worse than this if you wanted to play a long multi-player "conquest of the world" war game.  

However, it incorporates two VERY annoying mechanics that should have been edited out of the game.  First, every time you roll a seven with your two combat dice, you lose a unit.  What?  Why?  Because, life, and war, are unpredictable. Great, every time I roll a seven, how about I get something good in the game, because life is unpredictable?  Is that a good mechanic? Hint:  edit out this rule.

Second, every time you transport troops, or move ships to half the board, you roll one dice to see if you lose the ship, or lose the movement.  Because....life can be random.  It might seem thematic, but it ends up feeling dumb if it happens to you, and not others.

The "use the difference between your combat dice" is novel in this game, but for me, added an extra level of annoyance to the act of dice rolling.  Ready, set, try to roll two dice, with a maximum spread between them, and do not add up to seven!?  Wow, how does one even "wish" for that to happen in your mind?  How about trying to roll a straight with 3 dice? Or three dice, with a difference of 1 and 2 between them!  Fun?  

Sure, the idea here is to roll two dice to dependably create low numbers. Exciting?  Nope.  Why not just use a digital random number generator which generates numbers between 0 to 5, with greater weight being given to the lower numbers?  This would feel flat to me, just as the dice rolling in this game fell very flat to me.

Admittedly, the auctioning of alliances likely feels clever and interesting to hard-core wargamers, but as best I could tell, this mechanic has absolutely no real thematic connection to the world of this game, or reality.       

In the final analysis this is a game that feels like it was designed for wargamers who have tired of their titles, and want to play a variant on the same old-same old war game.  The game thus feels like a very well dressed version of Risk, without the fun.  And did I mention the game is too long with lots of boring down time?

{1 play, 5 player} Wow.  You have to know that a) I'm not that big a fan of Martin Wallace games, b) I'm not really into the whole area influence, psudeo war-gamey thing, and c) I blanche at most games that take 3+ hours to play.  Three stikes... and yet I was knocked out!  I hope my opinion does not drop with future play (assuming I can get in some future play), because this one just all gelled together for me.  Love the alliances, didn't mind the dice rolling, and was absorbed enough to not feel the length.  A real surprise winner for now.

*** TWO YEARS LATER ***

Ha!  Well, I've yet to get in that second game.  And I may never, though I'm not sure why.  I think having the time to really let my feelings for the game gel and mature made me realize that, though I liked it, I don't think I'll like it as much the next time, especially for 3+ hours.  And so, in this case, I think I've avoided the game specifically so that I can remember my one and only play fondly, as a game I truly enjoyed.  I'm leaving my 8 rating, though, as I think it deserves it.

Great game! It is definitely a multi-layer strategy game.
Many things to consider when thinking about your next two actions and your medium term plan.

And unlike other Wallace designs, this one has very few exceptions or weird, non intuitive rules.

I am grateful to have found a copy at this small store in Prague.

Aunque en el fondo es un Eurogame de mayorías, la presencia de dado le hace ser un poco menos predecible y un poco más divertido de lo habitual.

La fase de subasta de alianzas es realmente interesante y las losetas especiales le dan variación y una pequeña evolución que lo hace parecer un juego de civilizaciones (aunque no lo sea). Tampoco es que vaya muy sobrado de "chrome" pero al menos esos detalles le dan un mínimo sabor.

Por contra el juego es largo y con menos de 5 jugadores no creo que funcione demasiado bien. También se le puede achacar que si te echan muy pronto de la partida es muy complicado (o directamente imposible) meterte de nuevo en la lucha por la victoria.

He de reconocer que pese a que las mayorías las detesto, el juego está bien pensado y me parece de lo mejor de Wallace, junto con Brass.

Rating based on two plays.

We had a very positive experience, and this rating could rise.  The alliance mechanism and the different combination of special power tokens made for an interesting game.  We look forward to trying it again.  

The only possible downside is that there seems to be a greater element of luck here than with our other multiplayer wargame alternatives.

RATING: 7
I actually enjoyed this thoroughly.  I think the Alliance system is very nifty (you could set yourself up to utterly waste someone next war, and end up being their ally the rest of the game).  The combat system is just alright, but I think it works for this game's purpose.

It's pretty balanced too, in my opinion.  I do think, the one time we played, that things would have been better had everyone been more aggressive, but I think that might just be because we were new to the game.

As "everyone" notes, fantastic alliance/bidding system. Decent enough core game. Biggest complaints would be the difficulty in advancing one's position (the "taketh away" aspect of alliances) and the difficulty in securing military victory (I could still consider this a feature), tough one to rate. Complaints aren't what come first to mind when I think of this game, though. A full suite of 7 is a memory-making all-day event. I'd like to see what 4 and even 2 players might be like. Keeps me thinking about it. Very happy to revisit. Brass and Struggle are the two great Wallace games for me, with Brass still having a clear advantage.

RATING: 6
This is very long game - don't be fooled.  The game play is interesting though, but it depends on the players for balance since the game has no built in balancing mechanic.  It is easy to go after the colonies for the points, but a solid presence in Europe is essential to scoring points.  You likely won't win if you ignore the colonies, but you'll do much better than you might expect.  At its heart this is a negotiation game.  It is easy to think that the opponents during a war are in fact your enemies, but like in the times the game models, alliances are for convenience and do not reflect the real power or threat.  Picking your 'opponent' to be on your side in a war can be a critical move but one easy to overlook if you are vieing for revenge over a lost territory. [GTI: AGSD]

Got this to the table in Oct 17 in a six player game. rulebook is difficult to understand in some parts, but clarifications on BGG and a few players with at least one game under their belts helps. alliance and play order mechanic is very interesting and keeps everyone on their toes. suspect it would take quite a few plays to really develop an understanding of tile combos and strategy.

RATING: 9
This is definitely a niche game for a specific type of player.  At 3  hours and many may find this game too long or may not care for the direct conflict.  Love the bidding for alliances which is key to success.  Make sure that you don't end up outnumbered 1 against 2 on the european continent.   If you allow this to happen it's not going to be pretty.  The more players you have the more important naval forces are.

Plays best with more players.  A 7 player game with new players can take 4+ hours.  I think that an odd number of players is better as it makes everyone more uncomfortable and the bidding process more important.  The bidding is the best and most important aspect of the game.  This is a game where Kingmaking is build into the mechanics.  Always position yourself as the underdog, otherwise you will be lined up for execution in the bidding.

I bid high in comparison to others, but on the other hand the game unfolds more to my liking.

Truly fantastic game. A wargame area control Euro hybrid, this one really nails it.

The alliance system together with the tiles that distinguish your empire from the others are all genius.

Diplomacy, warfare, economics etc. this game has it all in a playable, customizable fashion.

Long game, even with three players.  I believe it can be quite unbalanced with three players, especially if the others outbid with their advantage and repeat the same 2-on-1 alliance.

Everybody seems to be angry for the whole game.  I believe the randomness in critical situations really frustrates all the players.

The wide assortment of free-action tiles makes for a lot of interesting combinations.  It's a little like Puerto Rico in that manner, except you can just buy Victory Points with gold.

Although Army Training and War Machine were quite useful, stacking up multiple Reserves seemed to be a real winner.

RATING: 7.9
Muy buen juego. No es de los míos pero lo cortés no quita lo valiente, y este juego de valentía va "sobrao".
Cada jugador representa una de las naciones poderosas del XVIII, y lucha en el tablero por conseguir, con el sistéma de mayorías, y en tres recuentos distintos a lo largo de la partida, la mayor puntuación.
Lo que hace de él especial, a mí modo de ver, son cuatro cosas:
- A través de una puja, con pelas, se consiguen fijar el orden del turno (importantísimo, no siempre será bueno jugar primero y no siempre malo jugar el último) y también se forman la alianzas (más que importante, vital). De tal manera que los jugadores primero, tercero,  quinto y séptimo formarán una alianza y los jugadores segundo, cuarto y sexto formarán la otra alianza de la mesa. Los jugadores de una misma alianza no se pueden atacar entre sí. Estas dos cosas hacen que la fase de puja sea una delicia. 
- El sistéma de puntuación. A lo largo de la partida, y en tres ocasiones distintas, se contará quien tiene mayoría de contadores políticos en cada región que puntúa en el tablero. Pero lo que lo hace distinto es que este recuento ocurre tres veces a lo largo de la partida. Y acto seguido, después de cada recuento de puntos, se hace una nueva puja de alianzas... Estas dos cosas van ligadas y hace que ocurra el famoso dicho de " al que destaca, placa, pacla".
- Las acciones del jugador son pocas, sencillas, intuitivas y fáciles de ejecutar. Esto hace que seis/siete tíos jueguen un muy buen juego en poco más de 3 horas. Un gran mérito. 
- El tema del Unrest es interesante. En cualquier momento te puedes hipotecar para hacer efectivo un pago (salvo en el momento de la puja) a razón de un unrest por cada dos monedas (un añito después Wallace usará un sistéma parecido en el Railroad Tycoon). Pero el jugador que llegue a 20 o más al finalizar la partida es descalificado y no puntúa, amén de que los dos jugadores que más unrest consigan al finalizar la partida tendrán una penalización en puntos brutal (creo que 7 y 4 puntos respectivamente). Otra manera de conseguir unrest sería por cada tropa (tile de cartón) que te peten en una batalla. 
Por cierto. tres cosas básicas para poder jugar bien: Cuidadín con las alanzas, el dinero y sobre todo la presencia en Europa. Las colonias decantan la victoria a favor de los jugadores que mejor lo hayan hecho en Europa. 

Lo malo, a mi modo de ver, es la temática y los componentes (bendito plástico de FFG!)... Me imagíno un TI3 basado en este juego y creo que sería una compra segura... Lo que refuerza mi teoría de que a mí me entran los juegos por los ojos....

Kb. 2 évet vártam rá, hogy kipróbálhassam, bár nem az ideális létszámmal, mert csak 4 fő jött össze, de így is megérte szerintem!
A játéknak vannak pozitívumai, de néhány negatívum sajnos rányomja a bélyegét.
Először is a licit zseniális, már 4-en se volt rossz, de 7-en egész érdekes lehet. Sehol se láttam még ilyet, hogy a szöveségeseket licittel határozzuk meg. A szabály maga nem hosszú, de a sokféle lapka miatt nem annyira könnyű (plusz lásd a néhány szokásos Wallace féle apró kivételt, pl. Törökország esetében. meg hogy ki kinek a szomszédja, stb.). A lapkák változatossá teszik a játékot, van pár egész ötletes köztük. A végkifejlet nagyon izgalmasan alakult nálunk, végig néhány ponton belül volt mindenki, nem lehetett tudni, kit kellene ütni, ki a rivális. A kivitel szép, bár elég puritán (a játék előtt valaki lefitymálta a design-t, de szerintem egy 2004-es játéktól ez bőven elég...nem a külsőségek miatt népszerű gondolom.) A játékvégi büntetés nagyon ötletes módon kompenzál a játék közben elköltött pénzekért (szerintem ötletesebb, mint bármely másik általam ismerte Wallace féle hitel- mechanizmus).
Negatívumok: frusztráló a kockadobás szerepe. A csatában akár 5 különbség is adódhat kockadobásból, ezt nagyon nehéz kompenzálni, simán leverhető egy jóval erősebb sereg is. Ráadásul ott az a fránya 7-es dobás, ami annak ellenére, hogy (ha jól számolom) csak 1/6 eséllyel fordul elő, nálunk elég sokszor előfordult, és az a két ember lett az utolsó, aki legtöbbször dobott 7-est... A hajózásnál is van szerencsefaktor, de az nem bosszant, ott eltalálták a jó arányt. És még a háborúk elején a zsákból húzott 10 lapka is elég nagy szerencsetényező, bár a lapkák eloszlása ismert a játék elején...
Dícsértem a játékvégi minuszpontokat a végén. Nos az alapkoncepció jó, de a pontozás maga igazságtalan. Hogy egy példával érzékeltessem: ha a 4 játékosnak a játék végén 19,19,19 ill. 0 lázadás pontja van, akkor a kapott minusz pontok rendre: 7,7,7 ill 4 !!! No comment. Egyébként különlegesség, hogy kvázi nullázódhat a pont, ez viszont nem kiesést jelent, mert csak a játék végén derül ki, inkább ötletes pénzköltés-visszatartó erőnek nevezném, tehát ez nálam a pozitív kalapban van.
Összességében jó, de az ajánlott nagy létszám, és a bő 1 óra szabály + bő 3 óra játékidő (7-en gondolom 4-5 óra) miatt nem kerülhet elő sokat...

Playing is poignant and open to risk-taking strategy. But a game is long and weary and the rules are not fully comprehensives. Then, with lots of interactions and diplomacy (alliances and negociations), fatigue and uncertainty may result in tension between players. This makes planing a game with (up to) 7 players for 6+ hours a risky enterprise.

One of the best if not the best from the "multiplayer conflict game" genre, there's a feeling of epicness when playing it. I especially like the fair number and variety of improvement tiles at players' disposal, this allows for some nice differences among players. The other very clever mechanism is how the alliances are formed. It mitigates the main problems in games of this genre - leader bashing and ganging up on people.

One of the truly excellent Wallace's designs, and I say this without being an area-control fan. I particularly love the many different tiles that provide truly balanced and interesting strategic choices and a lot of replayability. I would also like to see alliances to be even more committing. The dice roll to move on colonies bothers me a bit but I gotta have more plays to form an opinion about this mechanic. Another thing that bothers me is that players should consider the fact that it is costly to attack without an advantage. If they don't they could all team up randomly against a player.
This is the best area control game I've played, and probably one of the best games for 6-7 players.

Fantastic wargame, with the good idea of coalitions. Been a while I've played this game.
A new play about 10 years later wasn't that fantastic anymore : I was very unlucky with the dice and because besides the cost of every attack, I received almost everytime unrest my situation became hopeless. 
We just played with 4 players and maybe that's not enough.

RATING: 7
The great thing about this game is the bidding for forced alliances.  Basically, players are forced to be in one of two groups.  If you are in the same group as another player, you cannot attack them... which is Awesome!  I can only imagine alliances being even more awesome with an odd number of players.

Struggle of Empires has a lot of randomness that can really hose you, but I made peace with it early.  Keep in mind that this is coming from someone who usually dislikes randomness.  An example of some pretty random stuff is the dice based combat.  Instead of adding up the total of two dice (like in most games,) your attack value is instead the difference of your own two dice! To make combat even more random, any player who rolls a seven also loses 1 unit.  This can result in some pretty random shifts in power, but for some strange reason, I thinks it's brilliant. 

Unfortunately there are a few artistic decisions that could have been made better, but I guess that can be said of most Warfrog games.  To be honest, I'd probably rate SoE even higher if the game didn't require "fan" made player aids, if the tiles were larger, and if more wood was used instead of cardboard chits.

Two playings, though neither to the end game.  It's just taken too long, first 4  hours as a 6er and 3  hours as a 4er.  

The game itself is fairly straightforward, though there is a lot going on and a great deal to plan through.   The Alliance mechanism is well implemented and creates a real need for diplomacy throughout the game.

I wish Mr. Wallace made games playable in an hour so I could have them hit the table more often!

RATING: 10
Its long, it can be brutal, but it is satisfying. There seems to be plenty of depth in the variety of choices available each action round, attempting to use the tiles and units to hold on to scoring regions is a challenge with multiple enemies. The auctions for alliances is the best way I've seen to handle multiplayer diplomacy games, since it limits how many players can pounce on the leader. Everyone has a say in how these alliances are set, including the leaders, and allies don't have to cooperate. There are even ways for allies to indirectly attack each other. All of these in a highly thematic package.

I set-up the game board, read the rules over 20+/- times (and still missed critical areas which just seem to sneak right between the eyes) and gave it a go.  I appreciate how neatly and easily the counters and tiles separate, a sign of good quality (and having punced many a wargame sheet, I know good, bad and ugggggly).  I think I've played it incorrectly several times, but I am learning--I hope.
 
Well, it is not a wargame by any stretch of the imagination, but as a strategy game of area control, it appears to be quite good.  Combat is so abstracted that it makes the battle card system in Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage look absolutely sophisticated (and that's not good).  When does the desire for simplicity and ease of play become an "issue"?  Would it have increased the complexity too much to have given particular nations certain combat benefits that match their historical strengths.  For example, the British fleet was the best in the world, and it should have a +1 advantage in any fight, end of story.  Perhaps the Prussian army, when fighting in the German States, should have a +1 advantage.  Food for thought.  

The mechanism(s) for making strategy decisions are quite excellent, and add a high degree of enjoyable tension.  The greater the number of players, the more likely that you will not acquire every improvement tile that you might want

I do find it more than odd that, in a most ahistorical fashion, Prussia and Austria can become great global powers.  I understand that the players who take these countries deserve to have an equal playing field, but that field needs to be Europe, not South America or the Far East.

I can understand the complaints about luck, but how can this element be removed from the games we love?

The alliance system is nifty, as has been observed by about a gizzillion others.  Yet, only one can win ("one ring to bind them," perhaps).  There's nothing quite like placing a slave revolt tile on your ally, who was leading by one point ahead of you, but now finishes in second place.

I wish the rules were clearer and longer, with more examples.  Why put so much effort into other aspects of the game (basic gameplay, components, etc.) and get "lazy" with the rules?  Why go 1st class in some areas and 3rd class in others?

I know that Martin Wallace likes dice in games like some people like sugar in tea. Unfortunately the dice in SoE is the equivalent of 6 sugars and half a cup of syrup, except the game is alot more sickly.

It starts off badly with a randon draw of territories to occupy. A nice spread would be a good start but the randomness can cause a huge disparity in starting advantage with 3 counters in one zone effectively cutting a player off from 65% of the board in war 1.

Build a ship and roll a die, attack, roll 2 die, rol a 7 and lose an army regardless, yuk yuk yuk. Sure the dice can be biased with purchased tiles but bad rolls will scupper you into submission regardless before the game even starts. The game will be won on the roll of dice.

For learners the game is tortuously slow, the rules are fiddly and there is endless cross referencing of rules to establish who can do what and when. 

After 3.5 hours we were speeding up but I had lost the will to live early on. Someone had to catch a train and the game was mercifully put to the sword.

A truly nasty experience and never to be repeated. Fine if you love dice and get all excited about rolling good numbers. Crap if you like to drive the game instead iof being a passenger.

Played it twice, Waay too long.  The auction process takes too long, though I love some elements of it.  After my second play, I did better understanding the mechanics but still think it's just an average game.

Cracking empire building (and empire maintaining) game. It seems to solve many of the aspects of this genre that irritate me: very little downtime, you always seem involved (and everything matters!); plenty of things to do without being overwhelming and much more to the strategy than simply 'stay in the pack until the last turn then bash the leader." Can play long but the time passes quickly. All the mechanisms seem to fit together very well and the game comfortably combines the abstract (bidding for alliances, improvement tiles etc) and concrete (military movement, control and combat). There is some luck insofar as you can win some lucky battles and lose some that should have been walkovers but c'est la guerre. However,I would bet that few games are won by a player who has simply been lucky. And the thematic flavour is spot on. I can understand why some people might find the slavery element an inappropriate, or at least uncomfortable subject for a game that could hardly be described as an accurate simulation of the time, but it does provide a useful extra layer of strategy and period flavour, and to deny the slave trade a role in a game that is inspired by the colonial age would be revisionist in the extreme. (And perhaps it is good to feel uncomfortable.) Mind you, you'll never get me to play a game of Geronimo. Have played with five and six players - might not be quite so much fun with less but am open to persuasion.

This game resides somewhere in the twilight between wargames and eurogames. But for me it's too abstract for a wargame while not being original enough for an engaging euro. Some of the design choices made, defy all logic from my point of view. For instance I don't like the way ties are handled, it just makes no sense. The map is among the worst designed gameboards I've ever seen. It's too small and just very counter-intuitive. The only thing making this game worth playing for me is the alliance mechanic. This auction at the start of each war is the pumping heart of the game and saves the game from a very bad rating. So certainly not one of Wallace's best games.

Although it has the illusion of being chaotic, random and brutal, playing Struggle of Empires with experienced players leaves you satiated and satisfied in the civilization, area control and conquest genres. The bidding for alliance mechanic is tense and engaging when competent players vie for the right choice of allies. The tile upgrades provide abilities to mitigate the randomness while providing varied approaches and interesting strategical and tactical decision points.

 Struggles of Empires can be long and haphazard, but the different paths available maintains it's freshness and charm. The consensus is that it scales best with five and I would tend to agree with that opinion. 

This is a gamer's game with a Martin Wallace pedigree that has substantial replayability and gameplay. A keeper!

First impression: Unapproachable. I think I will  never get to play this due tovery very very long spendt of time SoE needs.

In our first attempt (7 players) after the rules explanation we started the game and in the 1st turn of the 1st war, everybody knew that the game was impossible to finish in few than 6 hours, so disappointment grew on us and after 3 turns, we decided to change to another game.

I don't want to trade it away but I'm convinced that it will fill of dust in my shelves.

Can't really think of a flaw on this one. Movement rules can be somewhat hard to remember (with German state having no sea battles even though it has a shore, and boats in the Mediterranean counting for the Ottoman Empire...) and the very-clear scoring track can make some of the players that are left behind feel discouraged (this game does support a lot of players), but this is definitely the best game of "porrada" (the portuguese equivalent for "ass kicking") I've ever played. Simple area-majority scoring with a great battle system (the dice system works very well) and an incredible alliance dispute at the start of each turn. Awesome stuff.

I love it!

Okay for a long game that is heavy in politics/diplomacy.  Unrest tokens are a good balancing mechanism; they reduce conflict and over-spending.  (game#1,7p,6hr; game#2,3p,4h).  Personally, I prefer fewer players b/c it reduces time spent on diplomacy and increases randomness b/c fewer country tokens are revealed.

Note to self -- in a 3 player game, it is unwise (certain death) to avoid making alliances for the entire game.  It might save you a bunch of money if opponents are bidding high, but you will lose (and likely get beaten up and kicked out of every country on the board) if you fail to pony up some cash and make an ally for at least one "era" or "turn" of the game.

Another excellent Martin Wallace game. Area Movement/influence game. Two main alliances decided by auction will fight three wars lasting five or six rounds each.

Player turns involve picking two actions from a menu to build, move, fight, colonize, choose tiles or pass. Battles are abstract but instead of the usual method of totalling strengths, drms and adding the result of a die roll, Martin has you roll two dice and take the difference to which is added various drms to determine the final tally. Ties are a push (no influence markers change hands), but each side loses a unit. A win allows the placement of an influence marker. The placement of influence markers in the various areas will determine the VPs to be gained, which are scored at the end of each war.

The alliance mechanic makes the usual "gang up on the leader" harder to arrange, and the variety of tiles available to provide various advantages adds to the range of decisions players are constantly facing. This game of strategy is fast paced, relatively simple to learn and highly thematic. One of Martin's very best!

Might even go up to 9. I would like a tiny bit more chrome in the game (historic "powers" for the empires or somthing). As is some strange stuff can happen. In my last game Russia and Prussia where fighting it out in North America...
The game does a ver y good job of showing some core features of the erea depicted. Countries can´t attack each other directly, You are often allied with your most bitter enemy, and all the natives pay the price for your power-lust. Might be too random/non historic for wargamers and too conflict oriented and random (and long, approx. 4h) for eurogamers, but for me it strikes a great ballance.

Strategy game with many possible actions to take. Usually, you have to wait quite long for your turn. Dice rolling has a big influence on results. It lacks "handicap" system - taking a bad action has more and more bad results, therefore, losing players can't really catch up with winners in later turns. Several rules could be omitted as they only make game even more random. You can win almost without any interaction with your opponents.

[Bought from DE 2006-09-14]
Played with four friends and it was a very intriguing game, with a lot of tough decisions.
The two actions you get per turn is very limiting in the things you would like to do.
Needs a well planned strategy and a good reserve plan as the game can turn on you very quick.
The board is a bit too small, and the pieces could have been a bit bigger. Otherwise its another good Wallace game.
As usual is Wallace rules written in a way that is very non-informative. I would have liked a lot more examples and explanatory text.

Really like this game, but it's sheer volume and length prohibit much table-time with our crew. I suspect this problem would be somewhat abrogated by a tableful of experienced players. Nevertheless, pretty nifty game that masterfully straddles the fine line between Euro and Wargame.

I'd give this game a [10] but for the length - it's inconveniently long and prone to AP, which means it won't get brought out for one of my groups.  It's a very fine game, with an awful lot of things going on. One of those ones where you have loads you want to do and never enough time to do it. The combat system can be frustrating but it's easily accounted for, as long as you attack always with superior forces. Unrest and the alliances mechanics make this game; and the En Garde style Area Control scoring is the icing on this tasty cake.

2-7 | (5,7) | 360 min | 13+ | Martin Wallace
The exquisite alliance system is the shining point of the game. Difficult choices abound: how to develop your civilization, when to establish/break pacts, why, when and whom to attack, how to manage your unrest... Can be a bit long (5-6 hours) with 7 players, which is my favorite player count, but hilarious situations often take place. On the downside, dice rolls can really make the difference, and players can get obliterated if others gang up on them. Avoid it with sore losers or irrational players.

Based on one 5 player game.
Second only to Princes of the Renaissance for a Wallace game.
He's the master of weuros, though this one leans towards conflicts. 
Liked the mechanic of bidding for alliances.
Dice can be particularly frustrating in this one. Unlike, Princes of the Renaissance or Perikles,in which the luck of the dice roll is mitigated by the size of your army, dice in SoE can wreak havoc despite army size differences.
Very lengthy game. Ours took 4.5 hours.
Serious kingmaking problems towards the end of the game prevent this from being a better game.

Update: our third game with 6 players took 3 hours.

This game is showing its age. Having said that it is a good game, maybe just needs a little polishing and a few rules tweaks (I found moving/attacking very tough to do). A great 7 player game though - and the alliance bidding is an awesome part of this game!

Played first time tonight.  I think I could like this game, but I don't envision our game group playing it very often.

Played it again last week.  Interesting mechanic, but takes too long to see any playing time at my Friday night group.  I like the "alliances" mechanic.  Need to play this with an even number of players (6 or 8), otherwise the players in the smaller alliance get crushed.

RATING: 8
A clever variation on the classic Risk theme, Struggle Of Empires succesfully mixes a typical dice-rolling war game with economics and political mechanisms. The result is an excellent strategy game, not suited for light-minded players but perfect if you want to engage in a really tactical and deep battle. Matches usually take at least 2 hours and a half to be played and rarely surpass the 3 hours of length. Nice table design too. Too bad the different nations do not spot special abilites.

SoE has got a good old school wargame feel to it along the lines of Age of Renaissance but is a lot shorter, better balanced, less fiddly, less painful, and more fun.  The game is pretty well balanced and the alliance system is really cool.  Five players was excellent, four was brutal, and seven was hell on wheels!  The alliance selection with seven players is some of the most fun bidding you will ever have!

RATING: 6.5
As one of the few Martin Wallace designs that accomodates 2 right out of the box, this was highly sought-after on my part, but hard to find.  Well, not hard to find, but I wasn't willing to spend $50+ on a used copy.  In one of my math trade coups, though, I managed to trade an old, well loved (but never played) copy of Civ for an in-shrink copy of this.  I was very happy.

As a 2 player game, SoE loses only one aspect of the multiplayer game - the alliance mechanism.  To some, this will be a big deal.  For us, not so much.  I can see how the alliance aspect makes the game different, and really expands the burn, but there is a lot of game here, even for 2.  It is like a deeper, more subtle version of AoE3, with all those Wallace interlocking mechanisms we've come to love.  This is one of the best area-control games for two out there (that I've played at least), and all the improvement tiles give the game legs, spice, and variety (all 3!).  Plus, with 2 it is a bit less intense, and certainly a lot faster than with more.  My favorite colonization/conquest game as of now (when ruling out games such as Puerto Rico, which have a more pasted-on theme).

RATING: 8
After London, perhaps my favorite Martin Wallace game. It really gives you the feeling of a war game, but is actually an area-control Euro with a very well-integrated theme. The historical subject is represented in almost every decision you make: I realized this in the very first turn of our very first game, when my first move was to enslave the people of the Carribbean. As horrifying as that is, I am amazed at how the mechanics of the game (combined with one's own desire to win) press players into repeating the same atrocities that were made three- or four-hundred years ago, all in the name of self-advancement.

The historical subject carries through to the rest of the board: the Ottoman empire is notoriously difficult to conquer, Africa is distant and not incredibly lucrative (whereas India is), and the Americas are easier to navigate but are hotly contested, just as they were in the eighteenth-century. I probably won't ask to play this all the time, but it's a fine game with a very well thought-out historical theme. I'm not Martin Wallace's biggest fan, but as far as game design goes, he has yet to fail to impress me (exception: Toledo).

RATING: 6
The best Wallace I've played.  That's like saying it's the best kick in the nuts I've ever gotten.  It's clunky, long, and boring in many parts.  Screwing Spain, wonky sea movement that randomly hurts people, and the dice off system all completely suck.  There is something appealing about the game though, and I think it's the alliance bidding system.

Best with 5, too chaotic with 7.

Sort of an El Grande with combat mapped on to it. Lots of neat mechanisms, shifting alliances primarily. As with most of Wallace's games, lots going on. Too much to digest in one playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
(Rating is after one five-player game.)  Boy, this is a tough game to rate.  So, let me explain my thought process.  SoE is NOT a wargame, it's just a Euro with direct conflict.  In many ways, SoE is El Grande with a real theme and some slightly fiddly rules.  There are so many things going on, especially with the special power tiles, that my first game was a learning game.  I had no appreciable chance to win against experienced players (though that is OK, a good thing to have a game in which you have to improve).  The alliance and turn order auction mechanic is important, but it was not quite obvious how important it was to me at first - which in an auction game makes your first couple turns a waste as you try to figure out relative value.  I had no strategy, other than to get many tiles so I could see how they worked... and my score reflected this.  War is expensive, unrest sucks, and screw assisting alliance members in battle as I lost my unit in the battle exactly half the time.  I did not find luck in the game to be that overpowering an element, but the roll-a-7 rule is nasty and adds risk.  Risk is good... battles should not be entered lightly.  We played a five player game in 3 hours.  I was hoping for seven players, but oh, well.

Bottom line - I want to play again pretty badly, and I have no real criticism of the game, but for some reason I can't rate the game higher than 7.5 right now.  This rating will certainly change after the next game.

After playing a more controlled game with players who knew how to play and without someone having to leave after the first war, I have upgraded my rating from 8 to 9.  This game is full of tense moments and there is not enough time or money to do the things you need to do.  Keeping a handle on unrest throws a huge element of resource management into the equation and there is just enough luck to shake things up without destroying the balance or flow.

Not really my kind of game, as it feels kind of wargamish and runs a little long for my tastes.  However, I can see that this is a great game and could be convinced to give it another whirl.  Once again, Wallace comes up with a very tight game system, full of difficult choices!

[i]1 play.

[thing=9625]Struggle of Empires[/thing] was my second foray into the world of Martin Wallace "Empire" games.  Although it was certainly an entertaining foray, I couldn't help but find myself making comparisons between this and [thing=30658]Rise of Empires[/thing] -- comparisons that did not always bear favorably for Struggle of Empires. 

Struggle is, fundamentally, an area majority Euro in which players score points for having the first-, second-, and occasionally third-most "control" markers in each country on the board at the end of each of three "wars."  Naturally control is obtained through military conquest, and most of the game is spent carefully accumulating and maneuvering military units to time selective (and expensive) attacks.  The game also contains additional civilization-themed tiles that provide players special powers throughout the game at the cost of the action spent selecting them (a none-too-easy tradeoff, believe me).

Struggle is appropriately tight and unforgiving, and I enjoyed the implementation of a number of the game's traditional Wallace staples: each player's turn comprises exactly two actions, bringing efficiency and timing to the forefront of player strategy; unrest markers for military losses and overspending provide the signature "pain" currency; and a novel alliance mechanic provides the required "Hey, that's clever" moments.  Among experienced players, I have no doubt that the game can provide an extremely entertaining and tense affair, fraught with difficult choices and palpable trade offs.  The core of the game is that good.

Peripheral game features, however, were often much less effective and detracted from my appreciation for the design.  First, the alliance system depends on several rounds of seemingly endless bidding that ran nearly half as long as the rest of the game combined (you know, the parts where you actually [i]do[/i] stuff).  Second, naval movement rules were fiddly and unpredictable, with seemingly little countervailing usefulness.  Third, the civ-tile feature consisted of selecting from a large pool of forty-some-odd small, mostly indistinguishable tiles, a prospect that significantly slowed the game with a few new and a few rusty players at the table.  (For those wondering, our play ran 4-5 hours, including a third war lightening round.)

Although I've previously criticized Rise of Empires for being too abstracted and streamlined (and I did find Struggle more theme rich and oddly charming), at times I found myself longing for its elegance, as well as wishing for secondary points-scoring opportunities once it became clear I wasn't in league with the area-majority big boys (in Rise, this takes the form of city purchases and goods production).  It is clear that Rise of Empires is a refinement of some of Wallace's earlier ideas.

If I could somehow mix Struggle of Empires and Rise of Empires, I think I might find a truly elite empire conquest Euro.  But each in isolation falls short of my ideal, and both typically leave me longing for more.  Moreover, the genre is not one that I have a particular affinity for, so I'm likely less willing to overlook some of the mechanical quibbles than others might be.  Struggle is certainly something I'd play again, but not something I'd be likely to request.  [thing=62219]Dominant Species[/thing] covers so much of the same appealing ground while being neither so fiddly nor so frustrating.  That's good enough for me.

A gem of a game. 

I was put off buying SoE because I played the forgettable trash-abomination, 'Conquest of the Empire', twice, which had its origins from SoE. I finally bought SoE for a very good price. This game is highly recommended, but requires minimum of 5 players for a great time.  One of Martin Wallace's better games.

Completed a full playing. Very good game. I dare say it's among my top ten favourites.

----
Played exactly one war round with six players. All of us newbies with me trying to explain the rules. Guess we were at it for three hours, including rules teaching. 

I think this is a game that will grow on us. It's got a greater learning curve than PotR, I believe.

Have to say though that at least the German rules should have been clearer in places. Indeed, a German language play aid on the web seems to have misinterpreted the rules in some places. Not all is clear or unambiguous.

As for common mistakes we made, nearly all of us six engaged in battles which weren't advisable. Considering the action, gold and possible unrest costs involved, one needs to put more energy into obtaining good odds and reaping the benefits of warmongering. 60-40% affairs aren't the way to go - at least until late in the game, I should say.

Oh yeah, pity the game's tiles aren't bilingual as in PotR. That was a very nice touch and certainly caters to both the international and German gaming market. Best of both worlds. Okay, French would have not got the same treatment, but then tiles have only two sides...

Played one 4 player game with learning mistakes but seem to have the rules right. Would love to play it again with 5 or 7 players.

Nice game for a large group. The alliance system prevents ganging up on the leader and involves a lot of tricky negotiations. It also eliminates a lot of the metagame that goes into alliances. Much better to play with people you know well so backstabbing is allowed and encouraged. A little too much in the way of special tiles (becomes difficult to keep track of who has what). Overall, nicely done, even if it is not my favorite genre of game.

My favourite game. It has great replayability because of the random setup, the alliance system and the great variety of improvement tiles. The alliance mechanic is very clever and doesn't generate the hurt feelings produced by games like Diplomacy or Game of Thrones. You know who is on each side and you can always pay to change it. Also much of the combat is against neutral counters.

The range of improvement tiles lets you pursue all sorts of strategies. Limiting your choice to just one each turn is really tough. The unrest counters (taken for losing units or taxing your home country for gold) make the end of the game a real nail-biter if the scores are at all close. After playing this over 20 times, I feel some of the costs of the tiles may be a little off - War Office seems too expensive and Militia too cheap.

Which areas in Europe are adjacent and which can have fleets could have been more clearly shown on the map. The European part of the map is one aspect of the game I'd like to see redone. Why, for instance, call Italy the Mediterranean? It just leads to confusion. The rules leave many unanswered questions. It's worth printing out the FAQ in the files section and keeping a rolled-up copy at hand to swat the rules lawyers with. 

The game length of about 4 hours including rules explanation makes this tricky to get to the table but at least there's not too much downtime since each player only has two actions per turn. 4 is okay for a learning game but it is definitely better with 6 or 7. The alliances with 5 can be very unbalanced. If you end up on the smaller alliance twice (or even all three times) with an ally who doesn't share any of your interests it really will be a struggle.

Jeu simulant la situation géostratégique du 18e siècle.

I am liking this game the more I play it.  I very much enjoy the establishing of allies before each war/era so that you can only pick on certain other players for a number of turns.

Rated 7 after one third of a play. I had been eyeballing Struggle of Empires in the past because I had read about its clever alliance mechanic, and it played well with 6 or even 7 players. It's a "dudes on a map" game, and that's a style that I tend to enjoy.

So, after having been taught the rules, our group sat down and played the first "war" or first third of the game... and then two hours later, we decided to wrap it up for the night. What I saw I really enjoyed, but the potential knock on this game is that if it's going to take 4+ hours, I'm not sure I want to revisit it with any regularity. I am intrigued enough though to give it a shot again and see if familiarity helps the game play quicker.

Area control based wargame with several interesting twists. The special power cards open up the possible strategies. I like the minus one dice from another to determine the outcomes of battles. The wars drag out and are far less decisive than in most other wargames. The way alliances work more to get in the way of some players aggresive intentions in a nice touch. It captures the spirit of colonial greed with each player pursuing their own objectives rather than looking for clean dominance in certain areas.

Struggle of Empires is a remarkably sleek game from Martin Wallace. It is a multiplayer conflict game that takes place over three 'wars'. During each war players take turns in order building units, moving them, and attacking. Another option is to take a special power tile which tend to improve your income, your battle modifiers, and other important dynamics. So far, so typical. What makes the game special is that between each war, there is a series of auctions to determine who is on who's 'alliance'. While members of the two teams don't need to work with each other, they are NOT ALLOWED to attack each other. This makes the auctions incredibly intense as players try to manage turn order, who they don't want attacking them, who they think might help them, and who they want attacking who else. A brilliant mechanism that makes for a great game despite the whole thing clocking in at 6+ hours.

I enjoy this game.  Recieved it as a Christmas present a few years ago, and it has disappointingly got few plays.  It has been tough to find willing players.

RATING: 9
:sugar: :( :what: :what: :what: :D :) :D The bad aspects, to get them out of the way at the top: this is a supremely dabbler-hostile game. Mechanically quite simple compared to just about every war-themed game I know, but with a lot of information overload up front. It demands attention from its players. It's a bit long (it's eminently possible to play in under three hours -- I've done it -- but it takes buy-in from the players at the table). It more or less requires a minimum of five players, and getting four to six willing opponents for this sort of game is not an everyday event for me. It's dependent on the players at the table getting into the spirit of the thing -- interaction is everything. And you can get screwed a bit by luck of the dice, though that tends to balance out over the long haul.

Having said that, I would like to advance the hypothesis that SoE is not only a stockholding game masquerading as a wargame, a la Imperial, but that SoE is a [i]better[/i] stockholding game masquerading as a wargame than Imperial is, with the control tokens serving as your portfolio. 

And I like Imperial quite a bit.

At game start, everyone is more or less equal, though the random draw of a few tokens ensures a variable setup game-to-game. (The downside, such as it is, of this variability is that what little fidelity to historicity the game has goes utterly by the wayside the second you gaze upon the fertile plantations of the Russian West Indies.) The canny player is on the lookout for opportunities to score cheap points, and the ways in which the multi-polar alliance auction at the start of each of the three wars can be manipulated are both intriguing and hard to appreciate when you first start -- the auction determines both turn order (in which both the first and last positions have some merit depending on the board position) and the alliance structure. Is it worth precious gold to go early to grab that fat colonization chit in the Caribbean? Maybe, but if you ensure you go first, you will have less control over who your allies and enemies are, and everyone will get one shot to play off your moves in Round 5. The tiles, too, are a source of joy and angst in equal measure. The more you grab, the stronger your position will be, but the more actions you are sacrificing, and actions are precious and scarce.

SoE is not to everyone's taste. It's too much wargame for Europhiles and too much Euro for the grogs, and there's a tremendous amount of information to drink in. But it hits a sweet spot for me and I am quite fond of it.

The one aspect that I'm not sure about is the relative value of a few of the unique tiles available to the first couple players in the first turn. However, since turn order is a matter of auction determination...I think that's a really cool way to fix what might otherwise have been a detraction from the game. As it is...you have a choice to make about how badly you want something. I'm really looking forward to getting more experience with SoE.

I really didn't expect to like this game as much as I did given all the talk about the randomness of the dice. In reality, luck plays a lesser role (roll?) in the combat of this game than it does in Princes of the Ren, as the "roll two and the difference is the result mechanism" tends to tighten the distribution up more than a straight roll 1 die, and add it to the starting total. That isn't to say that there isn't a significant random aspect in other parts of the game (initial seeding, native resistence, rolls to see if you lose ships going across the pond, &c.) but I think there is enough control via the special power chits to make it not only serviceable but very good even for a control freak like me.

Interesting game in any case, a hybrid of sorts between a traditional area influence game and an empire building one with a metric tonne of special chits to tailor your strategy with. I had to catch myself several times in the game trying to attack from adjacent territories with units because the presentation was pure Risk, but the gameplay is most definitely not in any way, shape, or form. Very tight resources as seems to be standard for Wallace games too...never enough population, spare unrest, or money for that matter. The alliance system is also wonderful, and it saved my proverbial bacon in many situations. Overall, really, really high quality...grafts an area influence scoring system and Euro tightness onto an American style conquest game and makes it not only work but shine. Definitely prefer playing this with odd player counts, and this is one of the few games that I think actually scales well to 7. 5 is also very good.

Damn you Paul and Jon.  You didn't give this game enough of a chance - it's fantastic.  The best game in the Age of Imperialism, a fantastic war game with brilliant mechanics.  Yet, two of my friends had a bad reaction and now we never get to play.  If you come for a visit and say "Hey, I saw you on BGG" expect to be subjected to this game - my usual crew wimp out on it too often.

After struggling to get people in my game group to play it ("too long", "too complex", etc.) and finally getting to play this excellent game, I've realized that German games have had the same effect on gamers as MTV has had on, well, everything.  I think gamers have been spoiled by fancy graphics/visuals and short play times and as a result attention spans for richer, longer games seem to be on the decline.  After our first test game, at least three people thought it was too long and never wanted to play it again.  Which is a shame, because SoE is a magisterial, elegant empire-building game very much in the mold of classic Avalon Hill titles like Age of Renaissance and Civilization seasoned with some of the usual Eurogame mechanics (area control in particular).  Make no mistake, this is not a 90 minute game by any stretch of the imagination but because the game has time to develop there is a level of depth, development, and strategy that is much more rewarding to serious players than most games we've seen come out in the past few years.  Rules-wise, the game isn't any more complex than Puerto Rico and once you get past the  (as usual for Warfrog) horrible rule book you'll find a game that will be well worth revisiting long after your copy of Goa has been traded off.  This is a good one, buy it while it's around or pay out the nose for it later on when it's OOP and everyone realizes they missed a winner.

Another amazing game by Mr. Wallace. I came in dead last in a 6 player game but that still doesn't change my opinion. 4 of the others had played this before so I had some excuse to finish a close 6th. I had some bad luck at the start but these things tend to even out and it makes life interesting when that happens.

RATING: 7.5
Great game, Rating is for 4 players, I guess with 5 it is even better. Might be not as good with three (alliances problematic) or 7 (too long, more chaotic).

Basic rules are rather simple, but there are many many options to choose from each round. So it is a long game. Because of playing time reasons you might not be able to play it as often as you like.
 
Great unique auction for alliances system.

One play - compelling game with a variety of strategic paths.  Our game seemed to go overly long, but that may have had a lot to do with people taking their time to learn the various options available.  Hopefully that would pick up with repeated play.  Didn't mind the downtime much because there was a lot to focus on and ponder even when I was not the active player.  I like that.

Martin Wallace seems to be my thing, so I picked this up, since I couldn't justify AOS (I have Railroad Tycoon, and I can't get it played) and PotR is OOP (How is that for acronym heavy)

Unfortunately in one play this game has not lived up to my hopes.  The game itself is fine.  But it has been cursed with the "long game that feels long" problem.  I find that if a game feels long, I won't end up playing it.

The game itself is a lot of fun.  It feels like a Struggle.  Play with the right people and this will be a winner.

Struggle of Empires recreates the various wars fought between the European powers as they attempted to become the dominant force in Europe and the rest of the world during the eighteenth century. Build armies and fleets, make alliances, establish colonies, improve your economy, and ultimately wage war to expand your empire. Be careful, though, as a profligate country can end up being consumed by revolution.

RATING: 8
Un juego muy divertido con cierta regustillo "civlite". Se trata simple y llanamente de un juego de mayorías, pero para conseguir las mayorías hay que gestionar varipintos detalles que se acercan a lo que podría ser un juego de civilizaciones. Hay que gestionar ejércitos, flotas, batallas, dinero, población, el descontento de la población, en fin, que son muchos aspectos donde hay que intentar mantener un equilibrio que no es sencillo. El multijugador está conseguidísimo, la mecánica de alianzas es simplemente genial, y su único defecto es el que presentan casi todos los juegos de civilizaciones o "semejantes", y es que o te juntas con gente que juegue con sentido común o a lo que juegas es a la ruleta rusa ... jugar con jugadores impulsivos a este juego es como conducir con un mono con una ballesta al lado xD

RATING: 9
A great conquest game. There are many different options to take with your empire. Just the perfect amount of randomness for this type of game. Alliances are fickle, but in the end it's basically every man for himself. Includes many interesting mechanisms, including auction for turn order (and alliances), taxing for money and causing unrest among population, spending population to build armies, paying upkeep for armies, and combat rolls using the spread of dice outcomes. Easy to learn, but difficult to master, it seems.  Probably better, the more players participating. Just the right amount of negotiation in a game, and I love how the alliances can change over the course of the game. Overall, an excellent psuedo-wargame with quite a bit of player interaction.

Enjoyable twist on "influence in areas". Its got that wonderful tension which comes from wanting to do a hundred different things, but you can only do two. The tile buying mechanic and slow release of new country tiles work wonderfully and the battles resolve quickly. Also has a good balance between being able to reel in a leader, but not too easily.

It's a game I shouldn't like, with direct agression, very long play time, and dice based combat.  But each of these factors is mitigated by something: team play, interesting short turns, and an ability to play the odds and manipulate the dice.  On the positive side, it's a game with variable player powers, and many paths to victory.  Overall, I like it, but wouldn't want to play frequently.

I like this game.
I want to like it more but it loses 2 points from a perfect rating because its':
1. Very long 3-4 hours.
2. Dice-based movement and combat (it can be frustrating to lose a couple of key battles in the first war when the odds are heavily in your favour).

Otherwise, this is a game I will enjoy playing, whenever suggested, and is a fine addition to my game collection. I particularly like the tough improvement tile choices and the alliance mechanism.

Great game of empire building and brain burning. 

The map could have been better planned as some areas are too small as it is now and some areas like England, France, Spain take up larger areas than really needed.

The difference between nations is weird as well, some nations like Austria or Prussia is so much better than England, Spain or the Netherlands as they can easily reach most of Europe without having navies around.

Despite this it's an awesome game I'll gladly play again.

Update: Not as impressed any longer, it's way too long and random which contradicts the image of the game as a brain burner that rewards clever plans. Down from 8.5.

RATING: 6
Superb, if long, game where players assume control of a major power in the 18th century.  The game lasts 3 wars (turns) during which players take 5 or 6 rounds of  two actions.  Actions include building troops/fleets, moving, colonising, fighting or acquiring upgrade/alliance/company tiles.  These tiles create a lot of variety and interest in the way they interact.  After each war an El Grande like scoring takes place over several areas of the board - the Americas, Asia, and Europe.  Scoring is based on the presence of your control markers in these regions - these are placed by defeating the native states, other players present, or by colonising the regions.  A very clean game to play, probably around 3 hours in length once everyone is up to speed.  Several nice things going on - the alliance/turn order bidding system is very clever, and I love the unlimited bankroll/Unrest system (along with the consequences if it's abused!).  This game has made an excellent early impression.

RATING: 8
Amazing diplomatic wargame, and if feels like the game that Martin Wallace has been building up to for quite some time. The only game that is in the same ballpark is Dune. 
 
For a wargame, it uses an awful lot of classic German mechanisms: scarce action points, auctions for turn order, area-control scoring, and so on. One clever breakthrough is the dice convention, to use the difference of dice to generate a number. But the real crowning beauty is the alliances: every turn you auction off the partnerships and rivalries that determine which players will be allies. Or maybe alliegence is too strong a term, more like mutual non-aggression pacts.
 
In any case, the design is a thing of beauty and the only caveat is the massive time commitment to enjoy this rare gem of a game. No matter how well-versed the players, this is a long long long gruelling experience that limits its ability to hit the table.

I have played Struggle of Empires once recently. We were 7 players. We only played 2 of the 3 wars since someone had to leave. It was enough to get our feet wet with the game rules.

Every player was new to Struggle of Empires except one which just played once before. So with newbies, downtime was to be expected. 

At first I wasn't much into the game. Once the game made some progress, slowly but surely I was starting to warm up to the game. At the end of the second war when we decided to stop, I was very happy with the overall game experience. I would want to play the game again sometime soon. Looking forward to my second game.

UPDATE: Struggle of Empires is an interesting game which I would like to try again, though maybe with 5 players instead of 7 players. There was a very long downtime during turns since we were all newbies when we played Struggle of Empires. I suppose that the game would play faster with experience knowing the game rules.

Also, with 5 players, Struggle of Empires should be more interesting when bidding for force alliances. In my opinion, players would spend more money than in a 7 player game. Especially for the 5th player in order who gets a 3 vs. 2 advantage. 

Example, having a oppenent which is right at your door step and is stronger than you, you would want to net to have him in your alliance so that he would attack you the next turn.

Simple to learn empire-building game, with plenty of depth and lots of strategic choices.  Due to random placement of neutral counters, it would be hard for this game to grow stale.  Even though it's certainly historically accurate in gaming terms and is only presented as one option among many, I do have a problem with being able to profit from slave trading ... in fact, we don't even play with it as an option. (Africa was good for other material goods besides slaves, you know!)

RATING: 7
A very good design by master Wallace. People who like his games will like this as well, people who don't won't find anything here that will change their opinion. The alliance system is a good way to counteract "bash-the-leader"-syndrome (but the leader has to pay for it dearly), but still this is a game of backstabbing and evil moves, and it also involves a lot of dicerolling, which might not be everybody's taste. The number of improvement tiles is daunting at first (in this respect the game compares to "Princes of the Renaissance"), and more than other Wallace games you need several plays to really understand the game system well enough to follow a sound strategy.

Probably the best Warfrog game so far. The forced alliance system gets around the problem of "random violence" that happens in these multi-player conflict games.

RATING: 2
Pretty impressive.  The alliance auction in SoE is actually even better than it appears at first glance.  It is simple to understand the idea, that you want to pay to get a player who might attack you on your side.  It takes a play to understand that mitigating almost all of the random chance in battle is possible if you can create board situations where it is clearly in another players' interest to join you.  This requires that you spot these opportunities before they are obvious, AND that you arrange the alliances to take advantage of them (or, similarly, to neutralize others doing it to you).

The luck in this game is therefore mostly manageable.  The rolls for sea voyages are a bit more problematic, because they cannot be well mitigated, except by taking Navigation tiles, and there aren't enough rolls to not feel a little capricious.

All things aside, I would probably rate this an 8.5 or even a 9 because it is hella fun (although the dealmaking starts to get weird in the last war). But I have rated it in line with my desire to play because of the shocking amoral casualness of turning the players into explicit Transatlantic slave traders.

Played one two player game, and would love to try a game with at least four players.  Quite impressed with the quick play time, and elegant rules.  Alliance mechanic would shine with 4+ players, and I would expect possibility of excellent negotiation/interaction.  Interesting blend of euro game (area control mechanic) and war game.  Quite deep, and would best be played with experienced players.  Components are okay, using Antike bits might enhance the game.
I'm very intrigued with this, but pragmatically wonder how often I'd find a group of four or more willing to get into this and play it multiple times.  Mare Nostrum perhaps gets a slight edge in this style of game (economy, diplomacy, warfare).
Glenn Drover reworked the diplomacy mechanics of this game in [gameid=17710], which has impressive miniatures and a map, and since I have Conquest of Empires, Struggle of Empires isn't necessary.

RATING: 4
The much lauded alliance system is brilliant and is the main attraction here. Scoring is done via the mundane process of area majority, but it gives you something to fight about. I just wish there was another mechanism to score points (build Wonders, maybe? I'm joking). There are two big problems that hang me up in this game. 

First is that there are choke points in the game that drag the flow to a halt, especially with my group. The bidding takes way too long to conduct. Oh, how I wish it was a once-around with the start player getting last bid. The game drags with too many "whose bid is it?" moments and rotations around the table. Complicating matters is that my group takes forever to negotiate; we have point, counterpoint, counter to the counter, and then final word, summary, parting shot, and one more thing. [i]Whose bid is it?[/i]

The second major problem is that it's not uncommon for players to be effectively out of it by the end of the first war, and certainly a good bit are out if it by the second such that the game is down to a few key players on stage with everyone else watching. I’m all for dramatic battle results due to dice, but here the penalty for losing a battle you had prepared heavily for are so devastating in terms of the actions you had taken and the ones you’ll need to take to fix it that it ends up being de facto player elimination. It's not uncommon for players to relegated to spoilers mid-way through. The third war turns into players identifying who they think the leader is -- [i]Him! No, it's him![/i] -- and attacking that person/those people. The winner will be one of the few people in position at the end of the second war, everyone else is reduced to spoiler if not already.

This comment sounds harsher than I intended, I'm just disappointed I'm not among the ranks of those who are delighted by this game.

Great area control game that encourages people not to eliminate the other players, but to cohabitate with them.

For a game with such simple rules, I was really surprised at the depth of strategy involved with this historically-themed game of alliances, exploration, and conquering. A great game to introduce newbies to more in-depth Eurogames/war games. I especially love how the theme integrates. If you are familiar with the real history of the eighteenth-century, you'll get a great amount of entertainment playing "what if" with reality.

One of the most elegant games I have ever had the pleasure to play.  Incredible replay value, no two games are ever the same, and the rules are so straightforward and simple.

The alliance mechanism is a fresh take on the often chaotic atmosphere of empire building games.  There are many ways to affect your progression and indher your opponents'; much strategy is to be discovered in the many useful tiles.  The bidding for the alliance building phase is something that requires extra attention as it determines friend and foe for the next war.  It is good to choose the right "friends" and to select the enemies you will be picking on next.  All around good solid fun not without challenges.

Fantastic game and a great option for a large group of wargame minded folks.  The tiles are work to learn but the game turns speed by.  Lots to enjoy here.  This game and Through the Ages seem to boil down the kind of games that I love into Eurogame form.  It helps you sneak a wargame or civ game into a Eurogame mainstream.  Great game!

I need to play some more; rating may rise.

I absolutely love the alliance/turn order determination.

There is definitely more depth than meets the eye, as each game seems to evolve very differently.  Rating remains at 8, still has potential to rise.

A nicely made area-control wargame where players form alliances in order to conquer colonies and gain vp.Its has nice mechanics that really work out and its kinda realistic with the alliances idea.Although, despite the theme is obvious during the game i would have prefer it if it was possible that alliances were broken in order to aim for a specific player. Although that works too as it is interactive on its way and the alliance changes eventually.Another thing that bothered me during the game was the amount of luck on the battles which in combination of its long duration is a stepback

I am not totally secure with my rating here.  I feel as this game has a lot to offer, but after post game conversations and thought I don't know if it really does.  The too few actions to do what you want does add tension, but it also makes the action stumble along.  All actions seem to progress at snails pace allowing for very few surprises in battle, and most of the time basically just gives your opponenet a heads up to your plans.  This causes a lot of turtling.  A lot of the rules and mechanics feel gamey, and in contrast to the theme.  The alliance auction although clever makes little sense when applied to the idea of nations at war.  Why would a pummeled nation ally with it's pummeler?  This really plays as an area control game more than a war title as it is a game of efficently gathering VPs rather than conquests of nations.  The idea that territories are shared, and the way ties are resolved all pull away from any real sense that you are engaged in battle.  Another issue is with the cards.  The cards that seem most powerful are limited to one or two, significantly aiding the first players in turn order during the first war.  I'm just not convinced there are any real decisions here.  I had fun yes, it felt tense, yes, but really not sure if that is just a mirage set up by limiting actions.  Will have to play again.

UPDATE: No interest to play again

Very rarely does every member of our group come to a complete agreement regarding a game the first time we play it. This, however, has happened with Struggle of Empires. This is a game gone all bad due to the huge element of dice rolling involved. It does not matter what you plan or decide, winners and loser alike are solely determined by the roll of the die. This is not a bad thing in a game like Formula De (which I believe still has a lower element of luck than this game), but to me (and apparently all others in my group) is unacceptable in a game from Martin Wallace. The worst thing is that this could have been a great game, what with the alliance mechanisms, improvement tiles, etc. However, if we want a random luckfest, we’ll play something that is simple and fun, and not a game that takes itself seriously but should never have introduced such a high element of luck.

I had to lower my rating on this after getting some more chances to play it.  I love the theme, and some of the mechanics appeal to me, but we ran into some issues.  Specifically, the nature of the unrest mechanic seems really clever until you come up against someone who gets too deep early on and therefore has no reason to play cautiously or logically, instead playing kingmaker.

As the designer says in the rules, "this is not a simple game." It's not a hard game to learn to play, it's that there are so many choices with many paths to military victory.  It has plenty of tension.  This game will frustrate those who like to find the perfect strategy (at least for a while).

The rules are very succinct. Everything is there but it's quite an achievement for only 6 pages or so. Great colonial game- I only wish the mapboard was a bit bigger and better designed- I really hate the way areas are 'boxed in'. This would be a great game if it had a map similar to Colonial Europe's Empires Overseas- it would've helped the theme. The plethora of tiles which gives players all types of bonuses and advancements, provides a simple to understand method to tweak your nation. The Alliance system works quite well- adding much political flavor. A very enjoyable game that plays a bit long (4-5 hours). It does need an updated, larger & nicer mapboard. I'm thinking of creating my own & printing it onto a mat.

The tiles are quite interesting.  This is a game with a lot of chaos, as players have to decide what to take in the early part, and then have to take from one another in the later rounds.  There's a big pick on the leader(s) element that makes it very hard to hold any kind of lead.  Well-produced.  If you like chaotic strategy games, I suspect you would love this one as it's quite rich for it's type.

Is this Risk advanced? I enjoyed this game quite a bit. It has a good combination of wargame, managing limited resources within your empire, special advancements, and negotiation. It may very well increase in rating with more plays. The question is whether it is possible to sufficiently mitigate the randomness of dice rolling by negotiating. The first play was clearly a learning experience and I rolled terribly losing almost every battle despite reasonable odds in my favor. Unlike other games that use dice modifiers, it seems very difficult to substantially reduce the randomness of the rolls without good political negotiation and alliances. Essentially negotiating beneficial alliances seems much more important than having an extremely strong military presence. 

Rating increasing slightly with second play. Clearly the key to this game is the alliance system and competent negotiation to not only secure crucial modifier bonuses, but also to deal with other alliance formed on the board. Greatly enjoying this game.

Although it is not a hard game, it has a lot of chrome in the rules as well as many unclear situations that must be solved with a FAQ. Its subtle and is hard to know the correct way to play it. Struggle of Empires creates a web of alliances that must be wisely used in the wars during the game flow. It is a very psicologycal game, in which temperate reactions against betrayal or other players actions is often the key to succed. Never hurt another player if you are not going to benefit yourself, break the alliances in the important moments, keep an eye on these silent players who are really dangerous if they manouvre without oposition... just an amazing experience.

I've played twice now (with six and with four), and I have to admit that I'm rather disappointed.  First of all, the game is very long - too long for a game with such overwhelming luck and so much arbitrary whacking among the players.  I was very surprised that the game is such a diplomatic bash-your-neighbor free-for-all - not quite what I expected.  I also was surprised by the degree that the game turned on the luck of the dice.  A bad roll or two at just the wrong time can put you completely out of the game, with no chance to recover.  Every unit, control marker, and action is precious, and it's much too easy to lose many of them due to some capricious die rolling.  Consider the following scenario: 

It's nearing the end of the first war.  I wish to attack the Ottoman Empire, where two players have one control marker each, with no neutral armies present.  I choose the weaker of the two opponents, who has just one army in the territory, one fleet in the Mediterranean, and no army superiority.  I have two armies, two fleets, army superiority, and the Ottoman Empire alliance tile.  Overwhelming forces.  I choose to use the alliance tile to aid in the naval battle, since the +1 naval support bonus will all but guarantee victory in the land battle.  I roll 4/3 = 1 + 2 for fleets + 1 for alliance = 4.  My opponent rolls 5/1 = 4 + 1 for his fleet = 5.  I lose the naval battle and the ensuing support bonus, lose both of my fleets, and gain two unrest.  Okay, that's very bad for me, but at least I still have the advantage in the land battle.  I roll 3/4 = 1 + 2 for armies + 1 for army training = 4.  My opponent rolls 3/6 = 3 + 1 for his army + 1 for naval support = 5.  I lose the battle, lose both of my armies, and gain two more unrest.  My opponent will score four points that he shouldn't have scored for the territory, while I won't score the four that I should have.  That's an eight-point swing in victory points and a two-point swing in income - even more of both if he can hold his control for future wars.  I've lost four units, which represents four actions and four population (remember, population is also income!).  That's probably about half of my entire military force, and so I'm liable to be hammered and hindered everywhere on the board, not just in the Ottoman Empire.  Additionally, the extra four unrest could cause me a loss of seven more victory points at the end of the game.  I may need two additional actions to get rid of it (governemnt reform tiles).  In short, I'm in a hopeless position with three quarters of the game left to be played.  That stinks.  It's not sour grapes, either, since I've won once and come second once in my two sessions. 

There are some great ideas in this game, but overall it just doesn't pass muster.  I loved Liberte and Age of Steam, and liked Princes of the Renaissance, but I think I'm finished with Struggle of Empires.

Initially this felt like a really good game, but it dragged on for 4 hours, which was too long. Myself I thought it was quite easy to plan in advance and made most of the turns within half a minut, but my opponents could spend up 3-4 minutes. The worst was that I won in the last turn, as another player had 3 times 50-50 throw on dice to knock me down and win instead of myself. At that moment I decided that this game is far too much luck-dependant, although the positioning in the game is very important.

RATING: 6.5
Three plays, each with four players, I think. The game has two really cool features, which are the alliance mechanism and the "character" of the different regions dictated by the neutral control markers that are turned over each round. It's also kind of neat in that it's often a better idea for players to settle into detentes with each other and be concerned with the balance of power than it is to try to dominate the board outright. Otherwise, though, it's pretty much the ol' push-each-other-around-and-score-majorities type of thing. There is a large array of tiles that one can buy, but these end up being less interesting than they look, since most of them just allow the player extra resources or the ability to pack extra actions into his turn and so don't really affect overall strategy much. Additionally, the need for constant opportunism and the need to spread yourself as thinly as possible makes for a game that is both extremely demanding and paranoia-inducing. Overall I think it's a solid game that *could* be fun with the right group, but even so it's not one I'm especially enthusiastic about.

A high rating after one play. Another gem from this author (I am also a fan of Age of Steam). Layers of hidden and subtle decision making that communicates the concerns of 18th century statesmen (if not the exact wars and history they experienced). Might be a bit long with more than four players, but I wouldn't mind much -- it's that good.

Played with 7 players. Took over 4 hrs.
Nice game but needs some house rules, i.e. instead of 3x 5/6 rounds better 4x 4 rounds so that the improvement tiles have more impact and the alliances change once more (I was many times paralysed because the players I needed to attack were allies not foes). I also had appreciated when there were more economic improvement tiles. Starting positions have a great influence on if you succeed easier or not.

This rating is only after two plays and may go up.  There are a number of fiddly rules; however, I greatly enjoyed the area influence aspect of the game and am looking forward to trying to wrap my mind around this game again in the future.  UPDATE:  There's a lot going on in this game that I didn't see before.  The endgame is particularly a bear, if you weren't careful about your cashflow and unrest levels early in the game.  Very interesting.

An excellent game. Great subtleties in tactics and choosing alliances. From my experiences an early leader sets themself up as a target so it's often an advantage to be in the chasing pack come the end of the 2nd war, providing the leader isn't too far ahead.

The rules aren't all that complicated but there are a lot of different tiles to learn and for a beginner it can be quite daunting knowing what action to take.

So far I've been unable to sell the idea of this game to my girlfriend as she isn't keen on wargames. This is despite my attempts to reason with her and inform her that this isn't actually a wargame. In fact I've often noticed that avoiding combat where possible is usually the best thing to do.

Edit: Managed to persuade my girlfriend to try it and she wasn't as averse to it as she expected and has since played again. Steep learning curve though, especially for a non-hardcore gamer like her.

Wonderfully difficult choices based on the myriad tile uses.

The elegantly simple bidding mechanism for Alliance position is sheer genius BUT this game has the typical Kingmaker/Bash the Leader problem inherant in most multi-player wargames.

Two possible Play Balance mechanisms would be to have players bid for nations initially and then each turn have the player in last place point-wise rather than positionally at the end of the current war be first (followed in ascending order) to choose potential Alliances for the next war. Small advantages but this game needs SOMETHING to prevent or slowdown runaway leaders who come about due to the initial placement.

Es un 4X que funciona en base a mayorias. se juega en un mapa de europa y ciertas partes del mundo, y el objetivo es ser el mejor imperio (el que mas conquiste, basicamente). 

La premisa esta bien, suena un poco a risk. el desarrollo es bastante mas complejo. tiene partes en plan eurogame y ir desarrollando unidades militares (que consigues mediante mayorias en territorios conquistados) y expandiendo con ellas tus dominios. 

El gran punto del juego es el sistema de alianzas. cambia de ronda a ronda y basicamente crea dos "superbandos", de modo que si coincides en un lugar del mapa con alguien con quien estas aliado, no te peleas con el, y en caso contrario, si. Esto es lo mejor del juego sin ninguna duda, y lo que le da una gran diferencia respecto a cualquier otro juego del genero. 

El resto... es bastante farragoso, y el juego es notoriamente mediocre en diseño y calidades materiales. mencion especial a las unidades militares, que bien podrian pasar por un juego de los 80s. 

Es uno de esos juegos que es un clasico, pero que no necesariamente es una experiencia que quieras repetir. xD

Long but rewarding. Fills most of an evening. 

Another play, with 5 this time, 3 who often claim not to like heavy boardgames or gravitate towards the lighter titles. All of them remained thoroughly immersed for the five hour play time, and it remained relatively tight (though I took an early lead, lack of cash left me with poor alliances in the third war and I ended up drawing with the other experienced player). Really is a marvelous game. Playing with girlfriend who doesn't often like war-themed games, but aiming to gain control markers and loss of maximum two units instead of aiming to obliterate and remove opponents entirely lessened the confrontational feel of wargames and kept it all civil and lighthearted. Movement rules are a little complex, but for this group were a delight, as defeats in one area weren't taken hard by the casual-ish players, as they were able to move all over the board to gain points elsewhere. I continue to be impressed by this game every time I play it. The dice rolling is annoyingly swingy.

Martin Wallace's best game I've played.  Combination area control, with risk-like combat, layered with a very cool alliance mechanism.  The game uses lots of variable player power tiles you can buy.  Like a lot of martin wallace games, there is a debt mechanism and debt is encouraged.  The alliance mechanism is probably the best mechanic.  I wish someone would steal it and use it in a game that doesn't involve 4 hours of risk plus area majority, which to be honest isn't a very interesting exercise.  The alliance mechanism drives the game.  Its also an interesting way to deal with kingmaking/player elimination/etc., because the people in the alliance act in the alliance's best interest.  

The negatives are game length and end game diplomacy that can sometimes drive the winner of the game.  Its a four hour game and it feels a little long for what it is.  If they could fit this game into a 2 or 2.5 hour window it would be incredible.  The end game diplomacy can get a little silly as the 2 or 3 players in contention for the win beg for help from the players that aren't in the lead.  "He is going to win.  No I'm not, he is!"  Its a little crazy that a four hour long euro-wargame hybrid can come down to this type of bickering.  I enjoy social interaction in games, but it feels odd here because it happens after 3 hours of cold number crunching through battles and area majority stuff.

Overall, a very good game but not one I'm interested in owning.

There is a lot to like about this game. The pre-war auction is long but fun and sets up the 'flavour' of the subsequent war. The tiles provide rich strategic choices, movement and combat systems are elegant, the money/population/units/unrest inter-dependency skillfully addresses kingmaking and there's plenty of player interaction, direct, indirect, onboard and off. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Resources (money and population) are agonizingly tight in this game. The game rewards people who find a way to do more with less. What I like about the scarcity of resources is that it increases the risk-taking. There is an incentive to spread yourself a bit thin if you can because you can trust that it is probably too costly for your opponent to attack you here or there. But you never know: they might just decide to spend the coin and take the unrest to attack you anyway. But if you shore up your defenses in anticipation of an attack, you don't have the resources to expand. That agony provides the perfect motivation for, and premium on, the diplomacy/alliances mechanic, which makes for a very exciting gaming experience.

A game of diplomacy where the system mostly excludes bad feelings between the players, with a nice theme.  
Dice are there, although as a modifier that statistically weights heavier towards 0, which means that the stronger side (even by a short margin) more often wins a battle than in systems with flat distribution.
The production is so-so as for other Warfrog titles, and the rules could have been written much better.
It could have been much shorter, too.

Highs: A great auction determines player order and alliances. The area influence is handled well, with the variable amount of available slots in each area keeping things fresh. The unrest idea is very clever as well.

Lows: Ugh, those dice rolls are awful. Good luck won't win you the game, but bad luck will definitely lose it. The huge array of special actions and rule breaking tiles was a bit overwhelming... I felt like a bunch of them could have been omitted. The six hour play time seemed a bit much, but I've never been one for marathon games anyway. I'd play again in the right mood, but overall not really my thing.

This one is OK but I enjoyed Prince of the Renaissance much more. I am not a fan of die rolls to resolve confliucts and that puts this game at a distinct disadvantage.

This is yet a another winner from Martin Wallace.

He's taken a big, sloppy dicefest game, tightened up the actions and the funds (a lot!), and then added a no-man's line in the sand with the concept of unrest.

It still has some of the feeling of a Risk, but every loss stings because of unrest, and even some wins.

It's not a quick game, but you don't notice the time much once you get started- or at least only that there's not enough time or money to do what you want to with your Empire.

It doesn't pretend to follow history, but the need to watch your expenses while maximizing your gains makes it a real gamer's game, despite it's sloppy roots.

Even on the first play, this is (at least) a 7.5 - no doubt in my mind.

Ahhh, yes.  Colonialism!

I suppose it's not the most politically sensitive of games, but it is fun!

The game has so many elements that make it a hit at our table : forcing opponents to be your 'ally' for the turn, playing surprise cards, avoiding a revolution in your home country, upgrading your nation's capabilities and, of course, gaining all those lovely new colonies.

The only downside to the game is that it takes a strong constitution to teach or learn this game and then play it in one sitting.  That, and it really is better suited (and more interesting!) with an odd number of players.

RATING: 8
Wow... this has to be Martin Wallace's perfect empire building game.

The game mechanics and finances are so tight, with battles so costly and bloody, that the game conveys an epic feel of "struggle" through three "wars". It is similar in feel and scope to Age of Renaissance or Rise of Empires, but without the civilization aspect of it. It is more of a war game, with euro concepts like area control and bidding, along with an Ameritrash "fog of war" feel through its simple dice combat system.  

The alliance bidding mechanic is simply brilliant, with a "game within a game", where players propose combatant pairings, which ultimately form alliances as well as the turn order for a given war.

Players only have two actions per each of the six rounds that make up a war. There is a limited menu of actions available, but great flexibility about where, who, and what, much like in Railroad Tycoon. Like RRT, there are a number of tiles that can be picked up as an action (but you can only pick up one per round), similar to the operation cards, but these are all out. Some are temporary, signifying alliances with the locals for one war, while others are permanent, giving additional income or combat capabilities.

There is also the interesting "unrest" counters that are dished out for every military unit lost in combat. They are similar to the "misery" in AoR, or like corruption in Cleopatra and the Architects. 20x unrest, and your empire collapses. Having more unrest than your opponents will cost serious points at the end of the game. However, generating unrest is a crucial way of generating income, which is extremely hard to come by.

This has all the hallmarks of a great Wallace game. Simple mechanics, limited set of actions, but great flexibility on application, which results in a myriad of agonizing choices and strategies.

After one play, it seems like it will scale nicely, but is optimum with an odd number of players, as this will make the alliance bidding part of the game tension-filled and entertaining!

In comparison with other "empire" games:
1) It plays in a shorter amount of time than AoR (3 vs 6 hours);
2) The overall mechanics seem to blend more naturally than the "stock market/rondel" aspect of Imperial and Imperial 2030;
3) It is more focused on empire building through military action than Wallace's later attempt in Rise of Empires, which tries to mix some civilization/culture aspect, but is essentially also an area control game (which uses a similar scoring system).

I like it. I can see why it is so revered in some gaming circles. I eagerly look forward to more plays. 

Update (07/04/11): We replaced the cardboard military unit counters with detailed plastic miniatures from Viktory II from Morrison Games. There are enough units in Viktory II (the 8-player set) to replace all the cardboard unit counters. Plus, the colors of the plastic units match the colors of the 7 nations! As the [b][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/1031180/struggle-of-empires]image[/url][/b] shows, this gives the game a more vibrant 3D feel. After this, there is no going back to cardboard units.

Update (01/20/12): I just finished reading the rules of my own copy, which BTW are well written. Despite the rules density, I was surprised to see how simple the game is in terms of mechanics. Although there are a limited set of actions a player can take, it is how those various simple elements interact that makes the game sophisticated and engrossingly complex. At first glance, I thought the alliance auction mechanism would be too constraining, for what I thought was an empire building game. It became immediately apparent that without the alliance mechanism, the game would quickly fall into chaos, due to the openness of the board--there are no "fronts" per se, like an area control/conquest game such as Risk or Twilight Imperium (especially the 1st and 2nd editions), since there is fluidity of movement to almost everywhere on the board. Alliances allow each player to [i]focus[/i] their extremely limited number of units and resources (when compared to Risk or TI) on achieving specific objectives, instead of wasting it on defending their "perimeter"--what perimeter? Consolidation then becomes a matter of shrewdly forming alliances that force enemies to cooperate, while also forcing them to eat away at their friends. It seems counter-intuitive at first, but the alliance mechanism brilliantly simulates the chaotic, seemingly schizophrenic, but ultimately [i]self-serving[/i] nature of constantly changing alliances of the period. Depending on how the alliances form, this may remove the inhibitions of timid and cautious players, while constrain the vengeful tendencies of players who hold a grudge--the game is "forcing" you to attack; it's nothing personal. The alliances can also be used by the crafty player to passively-aggressively and opportunistically achieve their long-term goals, provided they are willing to pay the price in gold to "buy" this leverage. 

In this manner, SoE compares favorably with Shogun, rather than Risk, where it is about consolidation, rather than expansion, exploiting opportunities subtly, rather than through sheer force. There is admittedly a lot going on in the shifting alliances, under the seemingly simple and clean mechanisms. It is not a game of conquest.

As for the seemingly random nature of combat, after contemplating this, I am more comfortable with the dice rolling. Waging battles and wars was expensive, and fraught with peril. The game models this unpredictability well, but also offers enough ways to mitigate the randomness.

This is a fantastic game and one of my all-time favorites.

My favourite game.  Great theme & endlessly replayable due to the possible combinations of 'tech upgrades' (i.e. tiles), the starting setup & the alliance system.

Resources are scarce & actions seem even more limited so there's lots of difficult decisions.

I think the combat system is great (with battles determined without losing lots of units) & I even like the risk involved in sea movement.

Prefer to play with more players than less & ideally odd numbers (for the alliance system) so 5 or 7 players is ideal.

Like most Warfrog games, this empire building epic contains lots of good ideas, but they never seem to form a coherent whole as they do in German games. The main problem here is playing time, caused by lots of fiddly rules to get to grips with while 5 or 6 rounds of actions per war feels overly generous and rather than being in a quandary, I found myself casting around for things to do towards the end of the second and third wars. Better than average production values for a Warfog game, colours match reasonably well and the 'tiddlywink' money is a one step improvement over that in Age of Steam in that copper coins are at least copper coloured. Overlong by 50%.

The biggest struggle here is sitting through a whole game.

Interesting game about the quest for dominance among 18th century European empires.  Unfortunately, the game starts off on the wrong foot with an unforgivable design decision: random starting locations.  Thus, right off the bat, the British can control Poland while the Russians control Virginia and the Austrians dominate South America.  All this before the game even starts.  The lack of predetermined setups is a major omission.  Most of the game's mechanics work pretty well, although I found the celebrated alliance bidding system boring and tedious.  I can see how fans of auction games would like it.  I really like the simple yet effective combat system and the way that all of the different tiles affect play.  There are many strategic options available, from European vs colonial to militaristic vs economic; although again, much of this will be forced upon you by the random setup.  Like most multi-player games, this game has a serious smear the leader problem, so it probably works best with two players taking multiple empires.  Overall, it's a very solid design, but the random setup and the usual multi-player game problems keep me from getting too excited about it.

Buenas mecánicas como la de las alianzas (subasta quién será tu enemigo), la resta en los dos dados de combate (para que no haya demasiada ventaja por la suerte) y la de las losetas (que eleva exponencialmente los distintos modos de juego y las estrategias). Indispensable hacer una buena selección de tus losetas iniciales. El número de turnos prefijado hace que finalice en un tiempo razonable. Aún así es largo (recuerda que es para 7 jugadores). Reglas sencillas, pero con muchos efectos de las losetas (cartas) por aprender y saber cómo combinan. No olvides la parte de “diplomático” que tiene el juego.

I find Wallace games a mixed bag of love or loathe.  This one is too long, has too much downtime and too much information spread amongst 7 players.  There's no easy way to get a handle on the fiddly and unclear rules nor to easily take in all the different combinations of alliances and special cards held by other players.  Add in the forced alliance mechanic and it can be a frustrating 3 hours.  By war 2 I was thoroughly bored and by the beginning of war 3 the winner had been decided.

Only three plays of the game and the first game went for only 2 wars.  I enjoy this game.  Alliances are such a key part to the game and I like the fact that they are fixed for a whole war.  You realize this quickly when you really want/need to attack someone and then see that they are in your alliance.  Although some will not like the die rolling for resolving battle I enjoy it.  It reminds me of battling in Wallenstein; you need a significant majority to have any real chance of victory and even then fate may not be kind to you.

Rating after games with 3, 4 and 5 players. Struggle of Empires is better than I expected. It bears a resemblance to Princes of the Renaissance sharing, for example, the use of tiles which can provide income, increased combat ability or other benefits. However, SoE seems to be a more structured game, and has a better rulebook and components. On the negative side, SoE could be a little more refined - I think there are a few too many types of tiles and the die rolling for sea movement is largely pointless.

I _really_ appreciate the whole mechanism (despite insane luck when resolving battles with dice – because there are so many battles to be fought that a better player prevails anyway).  The alliance system is worth a special mention.  It's a novel and impressive idea...

...BUT: the game is long, difficult (for me) to control (and thus - enjoy) and requires a bunch of commited players.  Barring all that I prefer to play El Grande instead, which does - more or less – the same (->area control) in more accessible, controllable and faster way.  I just enjoy El Grande more despite it's simpler and it's got less dimensions.

Plus I'm not really into warrish dudes-on-the-map games in which negotiations play their role too.  And that's the gist of SoE.

Sold.

A very good game that plays somewhat quickly for the type of game it is. The decisions are very crucial and it feels like the game should be longer than it is. I was left with a feeling that it ended too soon, not sure if that's a good thing yet or not. But overall I very much enjoyed it. There can be a gang up on the leader problem which I experienced in my 2nd game.

Another good game by Mr. Wallace. Easy to learn game. Deep, tense and full strategic. Original the alliance system. 	
A great multiplayer game. Negotiation and wargame with a really interesting design, only possible failure is game is long to explain and after explaining can take 3-4 hours per game, but overall, is a great game for 4 to 7 players.

What an excellent game!  I played and enjoyed Age of Steam, but here's something by Wallace that I can sink my teeth into.  Civ-building area control is right up my alley.  I'm discovering that I'm more of a wargamer than a euro-gamer, but this title just might please both crowds.  It's not a war game to be sure, but it does have some nice war game elements to it, and difficult strategic decisions.  The alliance/turn order bid mechanism is brilliant, and one of the most enjoyable yet confounding aspects of the game.  There's just enough 'chrome' in the tile options to add a nice replay factor.  It's definitel on the long side for your average eurogame, and I doubt I'd be interested in a game with less than 4 players... on the other hand if you've got 5-7 people ready to vie for global domination for the afternoon, Struggle of Empires will suit your needs quite nicely.

Area control/empire building game set in the 18th century. Despite being area control (which sounds slightly abstract and German-ish), the game is really mostly about building units and fighting the other players for control of the world. Lots of die-rolling involved in combat, which gets more than a little tiresome in the long run. Only for players who like games featuring diplomacy and backstabbing. With 7 players it's also a very long game with significant down-time between player turns. The bidding-for-alliances round at the start of each turn is clever, but of course you only get to do it three times during the course of the game. The various special ability tiles are also well thought out and work really well. Apart from that, I really didn't like it.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (Jul 2017)

Martin Wallace is one of my favorite game designers. I tend to like his older stuff more so I was very keen to play Struggle of Empires. Before playing the game, I didn’t know (remember) it has any relation to Conquest of the Empire.

The rules seem complex at first but they aren’t hard to teach once you understand them, however, the rulebook doesn’t do a good job at teaching them, so we had many questions during the game. This made the game a lot longer. Playtime could be around 4-5 hours if all players are familiar with the rules. With more than 4 players , it has too much downtime for me, however, the game really shines with 6 or more players :/.

The theme is ok.

The game components are functional, but as is usual from Wallace´s games, they aren’t very pretty. The same applies to the art. The game map isn’t very functional as it appear to have some boundaries that aren’t really boundaries in the rules :/.

Struggle of Empires is a area control game with some neat mechanisms. The alliance system works very well and is the main feature of the game. You can’t directly attack your ally and you can fight together if both players wish to do so. The alliance system also decides turn order. The game´s decisions aren’t simple or trivial. The first part of each turn is to bid for alliances, this decision is very tense and fun as money is tight so choosing the right amount of money and alliance combination isn’t obvious. Each turn you have only two actions (attack, build a unit, move, buy a development, colonize, enslave population, pass) so it isn’t easy to choose the best one, there are many considerations. I really like this part of the game.

There is considerable luck with the battles and the movement to the colonies, but I feel there are ways to mitigate it, so it doesn’t bother me much. However, a bad roll can really hose you at a critical moment. I´m not sure how I feel about the random setup, here, luck decides everything and there is no way to mitigate it.

My big issue with the game is the blatant kingmaking it promotes (one of the worst sins a game can commit). In our game, I decimated a player in the second year, he was out of the game, but in the third year he decided to help another player just to spite me, that’s ok, it’s part of life, but what I really loathe is the way the game allowed him to hinder the rest of us. In the alliance phase he borrowed a lot of money to decide the alliances and he had access to unlimited money. As he couldn’t win, he didn’t care about the penalties so he decided the alliance, even though he had a lot less money than the rest of us. Until this point, I was enjoying the game, after this happened I lost all interest in it and I only finished the game due to courtesy to other players. I didn’t care about the end result. It is hard to understand why Wallace would permit such abuse of the money system, but, reading the rules, it seems we played it correctly (I wasn’t the player who read the rules but I parsed them while we played it, so perhaps I missed something). This is my main issue with the game.

Another consideration, I would have liked the game very much a couple of years ago, but I have changed a lot during this time. I no longer enjoy “dudes on a map” wargame style of games and its derivatives so my desire to play this kind of game was and is very low. I don’t like games in which bash the perceived leader is a constant.

Bottom line, Struggle of Empires can be a good game in its genre, it has hard decisions and lots of tension during its gameplay, but it has a fatal flaw for me, it promotes a blatant kingmaking with its money system and I heavily dislike this feature of the game. It has a high luck factor which I dislike in long games, however there are way to, somewhat, mitigate it. Its best feature is the alliance system which is brilliant. The downtime is too much for me. I will sell the game ASAP. I prefer to play Princes of the Renaissance. I´m disappointed by Struggle of Empires.

Struggle of Empires does so many things right - a large variety of special powers, opposed combat rolls that somehow don't feel as random as they could, and an alliance system that is both perfectly thematic and perfectly executed mechanically.

I do wish it were more Civ-like in the victory point scoring; area control is just too stressful for me.  But it is what it is.  It at the very least belongs with El Grande and Acquire on the list of area control games worth playing despite the mechanic.  Might be worthy of a 9 after another play or three, but I'm slotting it at 8 because that's where it's more likely to fall for me through no fault of its own, just because it's area control.

RATING: 9
2 plays only.

Long but absorbing Euro/wargame hybrid combining Euro area control scoring and action point turn mechanisms with wargame conflict. 

Each turn you're faced with many temptimg options of which you can choose but a couple. This makes for some tense decision making.

Rules are fairly simple, although knowledge of the large number of tiles to be bought (each giving some rule-altering advantage) gives a player an edge. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Outstanding game - lots of decision points - rules are somewhat of a jumble and some important parts seem to show up on the "Useful information" reference card and not in the rules. Can also be tough if you take some actions personally (where everyone else spends a few turns attacking your forces all over the world.  )

* I have now played this game a half-dozen times.  Bumped to a 9.  After each play, I have wished for the time to immediately play again.  In spite of the time commitment, I always enjoy the hell out of this game.

It's tight, balanced, and quite exciting.   Decisions are difficult, and everything is limited - money, population, and actions.

I like the mechanism of the total number of control counters available in a region being dependent on the number of neutral counters getting placed.  

Overall, given the relative speed of this game (~30 minutes per player), this may even make a jump up after a few more plays.  I'd like to play with different numbers first, though, to see the range.

RATING: 6
Another play... another loss.  Man, for the simplicity of its design (the entire ruleset is contained in 6 pages), the game plays way too long and seems to be overly complicated for what it is trying to do.

Movement in Europe is a gamble for most, because some countries have a decided advantage (e.g.-Austria).  With Naval movement (and the movement of armies to colonies) roughly every 4th or 5th round you are going to lose at least one unit (maybe it was just bad luck, but by the end of the second war in our game, each of our players had lost at least 3  units).

Tiles seem imbalanced (and some are too expensive), alliances aren't flexible enough... I could go on.

One more thing... conflict.  Dice roll after dice roll... with the "difference" of the dice adding to your total.  You are going to get sick of this after the first 'War'.  After one playing, the game rates a 6 only because of the components.  Another Martin Wallace effort that just misses the mark...

Played once and if I'm lucky that'll be the extent of my time with this game. To me the game is in league with many of the other big war games. Granted you do get to purchase abilities and bid on forming alliances both of which are nice. However, the game really comes down to moving your units and attacking your enemies. With the amount of time needed to play and the seemingly endless dice rolling needed to resolve actions I'm not planning on playing this game any time soon.

Struggle of Empires is Martin Wallace's biggest game in terms of scope - players are colonial powers vying for control of distant colonies and weak European states. It plays up to 7, a huge and unusual number for a game of this strategic depth. At its heart, the game is majority control - the players try to have a majority of control markers in each area in order to score the maximum points at the end of each war. A game consists of 3 wars and each war consists of 5 action rounds. For a majority game, the level of conflict is very high. Players cannot simply place control markers from their stock into a region, they either have to defeat native armies, or the armies of other players to increase their control. Some areas can be colonized or enslaved, but that is the only way to get a control marker without fighting for it. And fighting is expensive. It costs population (and thus income) to produce units. You need to pay money directly in order to fight. And any units lost in battle creates unrest among your people, which can count against your score at the end of the game. Money is tight, but you can always get it at the cost of further unrest...

There are lots of options. Players can form alliances with the native populations to help them. Players can form companies in areas where they have control in order to generate income. Also, there are numerous improvement tiles that can increase an empire's capacity to fight, generate soldiers and navies more cheaply, reduce unrest, and generate additional income. It all can be a bit overwhelming the first time playing, but despite the way Wallace has jammed so many different mechanics into a single game (majority control, card drafting, economics, fighting, special powers...) it comes together beautifully and, miraculously, it all works.

Flaws? The game does use dice for combat and for the risks of transporting troops across the vast oceans, but Wallace has built in mechanics in order to minimize the extreme results that dice sometimes provide. Rather than a straight die roll for combat, two dice are rolled and the difference between them is the base result added to your army's strength. This results in lots of zeros and ones, making the battles frequently close so that army strength is a greater factor than dice rolls. Still, stronger armies do lose. There are tiles, though, that mitigate these risks. I don't think the dice hurt the game because of all the opportunities provided to improve or change results. One thing that I do think is an issue is that players who are significantly behind after the 2nd War really have no chance to catch up. This leads to them being able to choose which leaders to hurt with no benefit to themselves. A problem that exists with many interactive multiplayer games.

I haven't even gotten to the best part! The one absolutely brilliant part of the game is the alliance system. At the beginning of each war, players bid money in order to dictate, 2 empires at a time, who will be allied with whom. In each war there are one of two alliances that every empire falls into and you are not allowed to directly attack an ally. So at the beginning of each war, you need to decide who you want to be allied with and how much you are willing to pay to make it happen. It's generally best to be allied with your enemies and a war with your friends in order to protect your interests. Although allies are not obligated to help each other, allies are allowed to fight for one another - if they can be convinced to do so. Money can be freely exchanged between players for a number of purposes - to convince an ally to help you in an attack or defense, extort money from an enemy with the threat of force, pay an enemy to attack one of your allies. The alliance system is a truly inspired piece of game design.

Bought for A$30 (about US$24) at CanCon '07.  Very clever alliance system and 'unrest' mechanism.  Can be long and dry.  Downtime is a big problem, luck a small problem.  Despite the alliance system, this is still a multiplayer war game with the usual devolving into a 'game' of A trying to convince B to attack C, and much of the result depends on this aspect.

Most of the game is a DOAM/wargamy/empire-building type game with lots of theme-related chrome in terms of different chits you can buy that help you in different ways.  But the most interesting part is the alliance building where you ally with about half the players and can't attack them, and than after bidding on that, then maximizing your position based on the resulting alliances during the rest of each War.

Struggle of Empires models itself on El Grande, yet somehow it emerges from that game's considerable shadow. Each nation begins with some funds and a moderately sized population from which to train armies. Waging war costs money, money requires taxes, taxes create political unrest, and political unrest can undermine your position at the end of the game. On their turn, players may augment their strategies by selecting from a pool of available tiles. For example, a player in India may take an East India Company tile to increase funds. Another player may select a tile that denotes advanced training for armies or innovation in banking. The pool of strategy tiles helps vary the approaches taken from game to game. Players also participate in alliances that are valid for a full third of the game (each round of the game represents a cross-continental war). In a five player game, three players will be one one side, and two will be on another. Alliances do not require players to actively help one another, but they do make certain targets off limits, preventing the game from being an outright free-for-all. Alliances are pay-to-play, so you may find your coffers bare after buying off an aggressor or sowing discord between two neighboring powers. The alliances are the stand-out feature of Struggle of Empires.

Update 10-18-09: Second play several months later. Masterpiece of a game. 

Update: 12-17-09: A 9 may have been over-enthusiastic. The alliance system is great, and the strategy-tile drafting really forks players down different paths, but in the second half of the game, amassing forces and attacking the leader(s) can seem like a real chore. By contrast, El Grande always remains quite fluid and there are always clever options to take. Here, when two players have to double-up on army-building to outpace an entrenched leader, and then slowly grind him down - it's just not the most satisfying way to close out the game. Also, [i]in theory[/i] perhaps the dice are rolled often enough for luck to even out, but this game seems to consistently frustrate players with all kinds of low-odds losses (1/36 ish). It could be that I have no idea what the real odds are when you attack with +1 or +2. Even if I'm misunderstanding that, the two-action limit makes it very hard to amass forces without the defender matching or even outpacing you with forts.

What a difference between my first and my second play (this time with 7 players). All the clever mechanisms which enthused me on first play, paled when the problems of this game showed up. The game was slow killing any atmosphere, uneven distributions in starting positions and dice rolls did their part to take players (ok, include me here) out of the running and a final alliance round gone wrong led to a runaway leader. The alternative would have been a solid game of leaderbashing with a nearly random winner out of the two or three next players. For the amount of rules, the supposedly many strategic options and length of play both possibilities are no acceptable outcome. 6/10 is the average of my both plays (4/10 for the second game) although I'm not sure if I'll ever find the mood again to invest the needed effort in this game when there are so many more satisfying games to be played.  
---
What looks confusing at first comes together real smooth. It features two innovative mechanisms: forced alliances by bidding and the unrest system as economic core of the game. Each turn the targets change depending on the current alliances and keep the game open until the end. Luck plays a big part in attacks but there's much more to consider than war and a bad strategy won't win even with the biggest luck. Definitely want to play again but I wouldn't play it with less than 5 players. Below that number the alliance mechanism won't live up to its potential.

As far as multi-player war games go, this is the best yet. Limited ability to act is what causes us that special Martin Wallace style of pain in this game. You just can't accomplish everything you'd like. Action limits, population limits, money limits, even the alliance system limits your ability to attack when and where you'd like. Then again, everyone is in the same boat, so the game is about being more efficient than your opponents. The improvement tiles offer a multitude of strategies. The theme captures the era fairly well. A bit long for your average Eurogamer, especially when learning. Experienced players should be able to complete the game well within everyone's attention span: 30 minutes per players seems a reasonable guideline, and worth every minute.

I feel bad giving the game this low of a rating, since I know it is so well regarded.  I can tell that it is a well designed game, but I am just too bothered by the game length.  I have played other long games like Die Macher or Roads and Boats, but I felt constantly engaged the whole time.  I didn't envision how long it would take between my turns when going through the rules.  So my dislike of the game may be a function of the group I played it with (and especially the number of players - 7), but I highly doubt that I'd ever be able to find people willing to give the game another try.  I think that I would like the game much more if it played more quickly, but who knows if I'll ever get the chance to find out.  I like the forced alliances, I think it's a great idea, and the die rolls don't bother me as much as others, so maybe my rating is a little harsh.  I also don't think that the learning curve is too steep, it's not too complicated once you have surveyed the tiles a bit.

Well... simply put this is the best multi-player wargame I've seen.  I know many players would characterize this as a "strategy game" instead of a wargame, but I feel differently  The reason for that is because the came DEMANDS conflict.

The game is a master piece of design.  Well balanced, and absolutely rich in the depth of game experience.  The bidding for Alliances and turn order is so simple, yet so sublime.

What would I change?  
-I'd love the rulebook to be better organized, with some additional clarity.
-I'd love to see the game with super production values, i.e. wooden pieces shaped like soldiers, ships and forts.

Despite these desires I still give this game a 10 because it plays so well.  I will not pass up a chance to play it.

Gahh, so fiddly. I really thought Conquest did it better with the components. An interesting but long, long war/area-majority game. There was nothing I found particularly special about this game. You had a lot of options (too many, in fact) which is hell if you're playing with slow players. 

I never really felt like I had much control (6 player game). Too many things happened in between that changed or completely negated long-term strategy.

Only thing holding this back from an elite game for me is the "kingmaker" problem at the 3rd war.  Or maybe it is more "kill the leader".  If you are leading after war 2, you have little, little chance to win.  Still amazing game with so many tough decisions, I  would NEVER turn down playing and wish it hit the table more often.

Sometimes I feel like this game's most boring and tireless promoter. It's a great empire-building game with a perfect balance of depth and ease of play; it can run a little long for some people, but the downtime is interesting enough, particularly with 5-6 players. Some people think the most original element of this game is the alliance mechanism, in which you bid over who you're allowed to attack. Personally, I think the best thing about Struggle of Empires is that while it doesn't have too terribly many measurements of success to keep track of, it has a wide range of tiles that allow you to really customize your strategy. There is no single obvious route to victory. [Editor: I've never come close to winning without Banking, though...] The dice mechanism is pretty innovative (and a leetle homage to Settlers, perhaps?). Manages to be on-theme despite the somewhat plain board. While it's quite complex due to the choice of tiles, the rules fit onto three or four pages.  

Since there's no game I'd rather play, and there's no game that would even give me pause if I had to choose between the two, this is among only two or three 10s I can think of, but of those, it's by far the best.

RATING: 7
Rating based on just 1 play. I think this game has a lot of potential and rating will probably rise after more plays. In the first game it was rather overwhelming with all the civilisation-tiles and alliancemarkers. Very difficult to form a generel view of the strategy. This game needs to be played more in order to have a good grasp of the game.

[LUP 03-Sep-2006] Only one play so far on Chee-Yan's copy.  I liked it.  Interesting enough for what is definitely not a Civilization game, i.e. no trading, no tech tree (although I suppose you could call the tiles techs) it had a nice Civ Light fell.

After a couple of plays, I fear this game has a runaway leader issue.  Maybe we just aren't keeping them in check enough.  but halfway through it seems as though you can predict the winner 90% of the time, this can be discouraging especially if you are well behind because the game can take a while...

Looking forward to trying Rise of Empires though.

Based on 3.5 plays.  So far SoE is my favorite take on the empire-building genre.  The forced alliance system is brilliant, the area control is elegant, and the combat resolution is quick (albeit a bit random).  Still, it's not perfect.  The length of play is a bit long, and some of the rules (movement in particular) are clunky.  My biggest beef with the game is the quality of the components.  The cardboard chits really should be wooden bits, the tiles ought to be full-blown cards, and the board is far too small.    Still, the gameplay is strong enough for me to favor SoE over its glitzier cousin, Conquest of the Empire.

TOO LONG !!! Our first game was OVER FIVE HOURS for 4 players. There is a steep learning curve, due to innumerable special tiles that can be purchased. In my opinion it will take many games to gain a decent feel for the special tiles. That is a huge time investment. Game also has a runaway leader problem built into it. The leader gains special tiles that boost his power to lead ever more.

RATING: 8
Highly entertaining, but can go too long with new players.  Be sure to protect the matte counters (see picture) which can become worn with little use.  (As replayable as this is, you'll need to.)  I prefer multi-player conflict games to allow for wheeling and dealing, which seems limited here unless playing with five or more.  Uses several clever concepts that will hopefully reappear in later game designs.

RATING: 8
Solid longer, multi-player wargame.
Simpler than it looks with all the chits out.

You own Control Points in the various geographic regions.  Having presence in a region gets you victory points.  You want to gain control of other player's to expand, but the beginning of each of the 3 wars involves an auction that forces an alliance between certain players.  You cannot attack allies, and you're not forced to attack non-allies.  So what trusts you built up over one war can be completely shifted in the next war.

Combat uses dice, but it is a very interesting dice mechanic.  Roll 2D6, and substract the two numbers.  i.e. 5 & 2 is 3.  Doubles are BAD as they're always a 0 difference.  Also, roll that _adds_ up to 7 is an instant troop loss for you.

A bit of meta-game to learn with the chits, but the player aid made it clear.  I enjoyed the chits because their special abilities/alliances made your empire feel unique to your opponents due to limited quantities of each.  They provided a psuedo-civ building aspect to what is primarily a wargame.

I've played three times, twice in 2011.  I find this game mildly good.  I don't especially love multi-player wargames, and so my estimation of this game will suffer.  This game has an interesting alliance system which puts some control on the proceedings, which is a brilliant stroke.  

I'm never going to love this game, but I can accept an occasional match.

A great game doomed to become a classic. It distinguishes itself from the mass of the rule-monsters: nice beautiful simple rules, but complicated (and I mean: COMPLICATED) strategical options.

Is SOE a wargame or a eurogame?  It's both!  Tense gameplay and agonizing decisions.

I bought the limited edition "Zeitalter der Vernunft".
First I was a little dissapointed due to all the downtime. It´s probably a game you don´t want to play with the all seven players.

But it is still a very good game. Not being a big fan of area control games I still enjoy this one as it has a few very nice mechanisms (war is expensive, Index of "happiness" of you people, different abilities of the nations etc.) which are so masterfully integrated that they don´t take up much time.

Played tonight at Halesowen Boardgamers - 4 player. I was France (gotta be blue you see) and finished 3rd. Great fun, requires thinking in "different" ways - an invasion of an area is not necessarily a threat to you, and equally moving into an area may not trigger a war. Definately one id want to play again.
Update. Played as France again, oh my did I get mullered. In my defence I was saving my effort for the final war, which we never reached ! Still fun, Ive reduced to 8 (from 9) purely because there are other games I want to play.

Superb area control game by Martin Wallace and an excellent simulation of 18th century warfare and grand strategy! The alliance mechanism is original and making the difference of two dice in combat prevents luck from playing a too high factor. The selection of a good set of tiles is crucial. The fixed number of turns ensures that the game will end in a reasonable timeframe, not like some other games where you have to be the last one standing and that drag on endlessly. ***** Try to control the German States and to secure a source of income via one of the colonies.

I love this game! It has very simple rules but offers great number of strategies and ways to achieve victory which I'm amazed with. With very little you can do very much.

The alliance system is the second great feature. You are only able to define your allies and enemies at the beginning of the war, what makes negotiations and player out-of-the-game sympathies during the war less important.

The game has one little drawback. Because of great number of tiles and free choice between them, the game is overwhelming for beginners who simply don't know what to take.

Udany system sprzymierzeń (i jego licytacja) i jego wpływ na grę; dobra symulacja wydatków państwowych (na początku hulaj dusza, potem jest ciasno); masa różnych ulepszeń do wyboru, według którego prowadzi się politykę (uwzględnione aspekty militaryzmu, finansów, logistyki, dyplomacji); jest trochę stochastyki (walki, podróże). MINUS
Zdobywanie punktów ustalane przez banalny system większościowy.

Partia symuluję (szczególnie w siódemkę) wyścig o ulepszenia dla własnego państwa, walkę o wpływy, ich obronę i żonglowanie kredytami i rewolucją wewnątrz własnego państwa.

PLUS
Good working alliance system (and the bidding for it) and its influence on the game; good simulation of state expenses (and of the change of attitudes: at the beginning "hulajdusza", towards the end "fin de siècle"); many various improvements to choose from for application in your state and shaping of your policy (aspects considered: military, finance, logistics, diplomacy); some stochastic implemented (battles, navigation).
MINUS
Points acquirement happens in a banal majority manner.
SUM
The game simulates (especially with seven players) the scramble for improvements for your country, the fight for influence and its protection and the juggling with credits and revolution inside your own country.

Really good game. Just right when you fancy a nice chunky 'fight' amongst friends...

The diplomacy element really makes it shine, and can bring plenty of trash talking to the table.

i've played lots of 3-player games of this and i feel it works really well [sack-off the aliances and just bid on turn order each war].

once you know the drill this plays quickly and is [currently] my favorite multi-player war game.

This is a very long game with an interesting system of setting alliances and tempering unrest.

I have since traded the game away.

Pros:  it has some interesting elements, such as the alliance mechanism.  The limitations of money and actions seems well balanced.  Cons:  loads of downtime.  Movement is way too easy which significantly adds to the "free-for-all" effect.  It's virtually impossible to build yourself a stronghold when armies can practically teleport around.

RATING: 7
Couple of games played. It takes some time to explain the rules, then ~3 hours to play. Normally I'm not a big fan of longer games, but SoE works. 

Some thoughts: there is always "situation going on" so SoE is full of interaction. Negotiation and diplomatic skills are needed, but at the end every problems can be solved using armies. Great. Battle-system is nice: roll two dice and your "power" is the difference of those. The other player roll dice as well and that's it... the rest is history.

Byzantium and Perikles were a big disappointments for me, but Struggle of Empires is a good one. I'm glad, that Mr. Wallace can make a nice civilization games as well...

Martin Wallace has done it again with another excellent design.  A fantastic influence/war game that seems to have similiar elements with (or a blend of) Adv Civ, El Grande and Princes of the Renaissance.  The Alliances system is innovative and very important to conflict, especially in the 3rd War phase.  A good deep game with lots of tile purchase combinations and tactical war elements and area scoring.  I'd personally rather play Princes of the Renaissance or Mare Nostrum (less analysis paralysis for me personally) a little more often, this is excellent design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Excellent game with both strategic and tactical decisions to be made.  The game really seems to center around the alliance auction AND the unrest which comes in huge at the end of the game.  The tiles, while certainly not created equal, also really play out interestingly as there can be several powerful combos in the game.  And who knows, perhaps this game will mark the beginning of a mending of relationship between Tony and I as we were allied twice in the three wars...;-)

RATING: 9
This game is brilliant - straightforward, yet deep with complex decisions. If you liked the world domination play of Risk, then this is the Euro version. Build your economy/style by purchasing tiles (abilities). Most of the tiles are very good, and their limited availability is a tense sub-game in itself. The world domination aspect doesn't have the sweeping advances like Risk does, (approve!), the combat is more sophisticated, and there is a naval component added. 

There are many tiles to coordinate, so SOE rewards repeated plays. Could have dropped the "Slavery" references with no loss in gameplay, (prefer "Tribal"). Too long with 7 players, 5 players is the sweet spot. 

Must play NOW!

RATING: 7
Looks like a playable strategic scale game on the imperial Europe.  Always a welcome as it is a card multiplayer game.   The gameplay is abstract but the relevant and important elements are factored in.  The only thing that hit me is the lack of historicity, e.g. Russia may be selling Afican slaves to the North America.  All powers are the same with no special characters.  Game-wise, however, it offers quite an enjoyment to look for players interacting and expanding their empires.  This game would be more fun to play if you can find more players.

[microbadge=7][microbadge=37554]

Things I didn't like about Struggle of Empires:
* Bidding for allies. For some reason this rubbed me wrong. It seemed like it just rewarded the people who were already doing well and had extra money to spend. The way it seemed, those who needed to attack someone because they were in a desperate situation may not be able to secure a position in the opposite alliance, thus negating their ability to enact a practical strategy.
* Getting control, and military not affecting scoring. Tiles that give you control aside (slavery, etc.), the way to get control is to beat someone in combat. This too seems to limit your options, making whole areas of the map potentially void of scoring opportunities, because there will be no control and no military there.
* The combat system. It's not complicated and I understand it, but it seems like it's going the long way about regardless for no important reason.
* What country you are. My favored country for games like this is England, just because I like her history. However, in this game, England is possibly the worst country to play. Austria and Prussia both have instant access to three European countries, and England has none; she isn't adjacent to anything. I understand the game actually tries to go far with its theme, but I think a bit of balance might have been a wiser idea this time.

A very under-rated game where you are trying to gain control of colonies or Europe.  It is an area control game where you acquire control tokens by attacking local tribes or opposing players who control European powers.  It is a "war" game with very Euro mechanics.  You have all kinds of special powers that help you win wars and gain advantages.  

There are some print outs on the Geek that provide you with some chit numbers and tile organization which makes it easier for new players to learn where they need to concentrate.

RATING: 2
The most disappointing game in some time.  I really wanted to like it based on theme and initial reading of the rules.  Instead it turned out to be a horrific blend of nearly perfect information, euro mechanics and a huge dose of luck.  The fun has been carefully sucked out of this game one mechanic at a time.  It was more of a struggle to finish the game than anything else.  The game is far too long for what it is.  The rules and components are far too fiddly, when it basically boils down to a very basic auction game and a dice game posing as an Uber-designer weurogame.  I'd rather play Modern Art and Roll Through the Ages a couple times.  Heck, I'd rather take out the trash, do the dishes and mop the floors than play this again.  It makes gaming a chore.  Bleah!

RATING: 3
Disclaimer: I love Martin (Brass is the first game I got signed in Essen), I love long and epic games, and I love dice. However, for this game, I just have to agree with everyone that gave this game a score of 3 or lower: Struggle of Empires combines the most unmatch elements in boardgames together: Long platime and high level of luck. Worse is that you need to spend at least 2 precious turns (total 15 in at least 3 hour game) to come back. Worse is that you get poorer because of just 1 unlucky rolls erly as the establishment by others would get them more money and better prepared for upcoming attacks. Worse is that the downtime between players is like hell.
If not for Martin, I would just give this game a 1. Sorry Martin, this game is just a piece of crap.

[Played 4 times]
Several decisions, strong interaction between players, some diplomacy. Suffers downtime with more players, but the area majority and alliances aspects suffer with few players.
Occasional bad rolls can seriously damage a player (and between expert players, luck seems to play a greater role; e.g. "7" in battles). "Kingmaking" is possible and likely to happen. Tiles aren't balanced (on purpouse), but then their selection is bound to be repetitive with expert players. The best compromise between interaction, downtime, etc. is likely achieved with 5 players. Overall it's "too wargame rather than eurogame" and too long for what it offers (and the somewhat random outcome).

I'm not sure about this one. Now that I've played both this and Rise of Empires, I am inclined to think I'd rather play the latter. Gaming time is such a premium that if a game doesn't flip my switch the first time, I'm not likely to come back for more (and winning doesn't matter, I've not won yet at Brass, but I really like that game).

I have played this a few times now and can say that it is a solid area control game. Sometime the game can take too long for what it is (it should take 3 hrs I have seen it near 5) Also there are all those annoying things that always accompany War Frog games, like horrible graphic design of the board, insanely small tiles with cryptic symbols on them (un readable from across the table) and annoying rules like rolling to see if ships sink on a trip across the pond. I know that sounds like i do not like the game much, but i do, the game play is solid.

Un juego de guerra con elementos de economía y control de zonas. REGALADO a César. Tres horas al menos de duración, con algunos tiempos muertos entre los turnos de cada jugador.
Primera partida de aprendizaje un poco lenta (2 guerras en 4 horas).
UPDATE: se rebaja de 8 a 7, porque el factor suerte está más presente de lo deseado: dónde se ponen los marcadores neutrales; los dados al overse en mar; los dados para la guera.
23 MAYO 2005: baja de 7 a 6. Nuevamente, pese a una relativmente buena estrategia que me llevó a ir ganando las dos primeras guerras, al final por un asutno de dados pasé a un tercer lugar.
Es decir, no es un juego en que uno se quede pensando en qué debí  hacer mejor (como In The Shadow of Emperors, Power Grid o Puerto Rico), sino que lamentando la mala suerte.
Entonces, un juego que dura 3 horas y que se decida por suerte, es mucho. Está bien para un filler o Ticket to ride, pero no para un juego que se presenta como serio.

Fantastic multiplayer that can be finished in one session (first game finished in 4 hours and not one of the 5 players had played a compleate game yet).

Mechanics are very simple but strategys are complex insuring this will be hitting the table a lot for our group.

Thoughts: Still my favorite Martin Wallace game to date. This game merges theme with elegant mechanics like no other game I've seen.

This is a very slick diplomatic game about European power politics in the age of discovery.  The engine is not very complicated, and the number of "exception" rules are manageable, but learning to play well is NOT a quick journey.  The depth of decision making (even without the diplomacy elements) is still over my head right now.  If only it did not take so long to play! To be fair, play speeds greatly up when you know what you are doing, but I don't believe the 3 hours stated time frame is going to be the norm.  I would say double that is not out of the question, especially on a first play through.

Martin Wallace's game of colonization and warfare is a clever euro game with a war theme that is very difficult to win and a great strategy eludes me - I have played twice and been badly beaten once and was second place the last time.  In this game we were all winners though, because it was very satisfying.  I'm looking forward to the next time around.

That was my first impression.  I have since played quite a few times more - this was in heavy rotation for a while. I really like this game, but it really doesn't depict the theme very well.  Also, to shine you need at least five players.

11/02/05 Received. A lot of negative comments in this ratings section on this game are from wargamers who don’t like the Eurogame elements in SoE, and from Eurogamers who don’t like the wargame elements in the game.  Well, as a player of both types of games SoE is right up my alley.  I will say this, the multitude of tile types can overwhelm the uninitiated.  A good rules teacher is required to guide new players through which tiles are of the most value to them. And make sure you have the FAQ handy.  I wouldn’t recommend including players who start to fidget because they’re used to playing games that last at most 90 minutes. Expect about 3.5 hours. 
As of 10/04/15 I've played four times.

I was impressed. Better than Conquest of the Empire and on par with A Game of Thrones.
  Diplomatics and Politics
  Special Tiles
  Tense and interesting gameplay
  Multiple choices everytime

- The board was too small and plain (more "chrome" please)
- Home countries were next to useless
- Badly worded movement rules in Europe (or badly designed)

Very good.

I loved this game from the start, very rich. Great interaction, wheeling and dealing when making the coalitions, the best part of the game. Playing SoE with the right group, that is really the best way to spend a game night. 5 players is optimal. 7 takes too long, while with less the negotiations about the alliances is not as intense.

Needs aggressive play. Playing "for place" makes the game pointless & is utterly irritating in this game especially with the enforced alliance rules.

Initial rating: Impressive! Although the rules seem quite easy, it's definitely not easy to play. Somebody wrote "complex, long & slow". All true, but for me not in a negative way.

It's quite complex, some of it thanks to the big amount of "alliance" & other special tiles. But it seems this game really fits together quite well & logically. It's definitely a long game, (longer than I usually want a game to last) but with no noticable downtime, since you're continously involved.

The first game went real slow, due to the complexity, trying to pick the best options, trying to adapt to what the other players do etc. But it all happens in a captivating way.

Played it with 6, first time for everyone, and everyone was very enthusiastic about this brilliant game and wants to play it again. Would have loved to just leave it on the table and play it again tomorrow...This is the first time I really wanted to give a 9 based on a first game.

Not something to be pulled off for a quick game, but definitely among the best choices if you're in for a gamers game that will last for an exciting evening.

My second game was a session with 7, with 2 newbies. It took 7 hours thanks to loads of A.P... But we had fun all the way.

Despite wanting to play this it took 3.5 years before I managed to play a third session, with 5 players, all experienced gamers. Much tougher.... Still a great game. Probably Wallace's best long game.

Wonderful, relatively simple empire, area majority game. Rules are, honestly, terrible, and there are some map ambiguities (at least to my mind) but there is a better rewrite on BGG under the game files. It's really more opaque than it should be. Gameplay is fairly complex, mechanics are simple. Definitely a lot to consider, especially when learning all the tiles. All in all, a typical Wallace stew of genius and some clunkiness.

But seriously -- this is a prime example of a horrible rules set.

Long, somewhat "epic" multiplayer conflict game. Love the interlocking mechanics, the alliances, the negotiating, and the development through tiles. In my play group the negotiating element was a bit too prevalent, though; and while fun, it prolonged the game excessively. Increased plays should tell whether play time can be reduced significantly towards the box time of 3 hrs.

Superb, but some analysis paralysis issues in the final few plays. Rating has climbed with successive plays. Wriggling into the 'right' alliance is crucial for a happy result, but is easier said than done (keep your enemies closer!).

Rectified my potential error of passing on it at Essen by purchasing a used copy.  A nice blend of elements which plays pretty fast.  Not a 'heavy' game as I expected, but interesting elements, including the alliance making; really affects the play of the game.  Glad I managed to finally put this on my shelf.  We played with three, and it seemed to work fine, although there was plenty of space left on the board at the end.  Our game with 5 was even better- the best Wallace I have played.

An amazing, deep, complex game. Probably the best multi-player wargame I've played, and certainly the best of Wallace's generally great games.

3 hour game, best with 5, or 4 people.  Better to play with an established gaming group, otherwise there's a strong chance it will turn into smash-the-leader.  Luck plays a big role. Potential for a lot of down time, but this can be largely avoided if players know what they want to do.

Another Martin Wallace gem.  This one has a lot of depth and an ingenious auction which determines turn-order and your allies for the round.  Add some light warfare, economics, area control and backstabbing and you've got your hands full for the next few hours.  As usual money is tight but in this game one has to worry about "unrest" as well.  The random country & resource assignments in the beginning of the game make for a variety of scenarios & new challenges each play.  UPDATE: I hate playing this game: it's nerve racking!  Somehow, still, I love it.

Pick actions, draft tiles and move your armies for area majority in the colonies.

Plays: A couple?
Type: Faux wargame = a game where you move military forces on a map, but where victory isn't intrinsically about conquest or destruction of enemies.
Complexity: Medium. For such a long game, the rules are surprisingly straightforward.
# of players: 5-7.
Playing time: 60 mins per player.
Player interaction: Conflict, Diplomacy and Competition for scarce resources - colonies and tiles.
Randomness: Medium - dice, with high impact but with control over when to roll and what odds to accept.

Replayability: Pretty high, there seems to be multiple paths to victory thanks to the tile drafting. Your empire "engine" will probably be different from game to game. The diplomacy also makes for an interactive game 
Fun: Good fun. The unique alliance mechanism is the most fun - you bid for your allies and you have to keep the alliance until the next bid. This creates wonderful tension as players try to outbid each other to end up in the stronger alliance. The resource management is also surprisingly fun here - balancing actions, population, money, armies and unrest is an interesting puzzle where you have to adapt to changing circumstances.
Memorability: Decent. Under the hood it's still a VP race. You are optimizing resources more than you are building an empire. Quick term gains are often more important than long term ones.

Thematic integration: Decent. Some mechanisms bring the colonialism theme home, like needing a ship off the coast of Africa to be able to take the Slavery action (no matter what you think of including slavery in a game). At heart it's a VP race though. The VP track running around the edge of the map is a sure sign.
Components: Functional. The map is suprisingly small for an epic game like this and it gets cluttered with counters at 7 players, but this is not much of a problem because the counters are cleanly printed with contrasting colours. It's not a pretty game, but it gets the job done.

Who will like this: People that like multi-player strategy games with conflict and don't mind slavery as a mechanism.

Multi-player area control game based on 18th Century European Colonial expansion. A clever bidding-based system establishes players into two alliances. But don't be fooled, this isn't in any way a cooperative game. The only thing that allies cannot do is attack each other - any other form of competition is OK. So, if you get into alliance with your biggest competitor he will find it difficult to take control of a region from you. There are lots of option tiles which allow you to tailor a strategy that suits you and you have to keep an eye on your population, treasury and unrest level as you forge your expansion plans. Like most Martin Wallace games everything is extremely tight - you always want to do much more than the number of actions allows. Very intense and involving game that will take at least 3 hours.

I've really enjoyed both my solo run-through and one and only actual play of this with other players. I'm usually the one hating dice in games like this (see Perikles), but they didn't bother me at all here: it was extremely simple and was virtually deterministic when one opponent had any sort of clear advantage. There's some additional randomness in the chit pulls that seed the map prior to each war, but everyone sees this ahead of time and [i]then[/i] gets to bid on turn order. Compare this to something like Eclipse, where all the random "exploration" is individual: I flip a tile, it sucks, and only I am screwed. Anyway, after muddling through the rules and the first war, we accelerated rapidly; I'd be surprised if this really took three hours with five players. The Alliance mechanism is excellent and can win or lose someone the game; playing that right is key to the game. Very interested in playing this again.

RATING: 6
Not bad for a souped-up Euro.  Has elements of combat and economic building, with what looks like some good strategery as well.  As a big plus it seemed to play well with seven players, and only took an evening to play.  On the downside, the rules are said to be quite sketchy, and the FAQ has more pages than the rulebook.  However, this didn't cause too many problems when we played. Not to be played with those with analysis-paralysis or min-maxers.

I have played this several times (~6 or 7) and I think every game has been interesting and fun.

UPDATE: Ugh! What's going on this year? First I find Successors III untenable, and now this? Finished a 6-player game that took...6 hours. Not only that, but through a combination of sub-optimal play and abysmal rolls I got hosed early. By hour 2 I was done for, possibly playing for fifth but more likely a definite sixth, and the next four hours were sheer torture. Rating has plunged accordingly.

By great Tresham's beard this is a good game!  Just played 5 player and it's exactly my style of multiplayer conflict game.  Love it!  The only problem is the movement/build rules which are pretty difficult for a first time player to get one's head around.  Like other good Wallace games, although I want to play again, I would have a hard time teaching it without more games with experienced players.  But, constroversial subject matter aside, it's a classic.

Does Mr. Wallace know his rulebooks blow, or is this a highly classified state secret?

I've only played one 3-player game, but this is another one I want to try again. Seems like you have a lot of decisions to make. I like a lot of the rules, like the possibility of losing men even in a victory. 

There are a ton of those little square cards, though, that provide bonuses. With everything on the table, it looks a little daunting. Not a good game to try to get more casual gamers to play. I believe this game would be better with 7 players. It gets a '7' for now, but I will revisit the rating if I get to play more.

UPDATE: For trade, simply because I have only played it once in the past 10 years.

Played: 1 time.

Meh. Another war-ish game with Wallace's overabundance of actions to choose from. Just when I think I'm a fan of his designs, he has these games that feel very mechanical and boring. My biggest problem was that I felt the game didn't have much of a focus to it.

RATING: 7.5
Very good game. I've played this with 2 players and the game moves along very quickly. Of course the game is always going to be better when played multi-player because of the alliances which are an interesting and entertaining part of the game... whereas in a 2 player game the game is much more about spreading your armies and navies about to grab control or at least a share of control in as many regions as possible. The various tile choices require a bit of thought as to which are most useful but I must say once the rules and basic game play is understood, the game moves along very smoothly with a minimum of downtime... this does increase with more than 2 players but not so much that the game suffers badly for it. All in all a solid game with a very good thematic touch and certainly not a game I would call overly complex or heavy.

Tight area-control game. Combat is pretty random and can destroy your best-layed plans.

If you play this with 2 people, the very first and very last player turn should only give 1 action and not 2. Else, the first player will hog all the good tiles, and the last player has too big an impact on scoring.

RATING: 7
This game is excellent in my book, though I prefer the Conquest of the Empire version to this.  Downgraded from a 10 after further play as the political element can be quite brutal so you have to have very thick skin.  If I'm in the right mood with the right group I'm ok.  With the wrong group it can really suck, actually, esp. if someone starts kingmaking or doing things just for "shits and giggles".The abundant number of choices for actions (and limited number of actions) in the game between tiles/regions/economy and gaining victory points is quite a mental "struggle". The mechanism of maintaining a balance between military ventures and area control and keeping unrest to a minimum is very well designed.  Then you have to balance population and income on top of that!! The addition of bidding for turn order and alliances is totally unique and changes this into much more than a war game as money is very tight and must be managed carefully with colonial ventures.  Beautiful map and tokens and tiles.  First Class and Highly recomommended. Rule Book gives very helpful tips on game play which is a feature many games leave out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another solid Wallace design.  Not as elegant as earlier designs.  It suffers from length and a bit of downtime between turns.  The heart of the game, the alliance phase, is great.  The actions you take during your turn are less fun than in Age of Steam and rely on combat with dice for excitement.

In 18th century warfare, buy tiles, move armies, attack or populate/enslave nations in this Martin Wallace area control game. Novel mechanic is bidding for alliances (you cannot attack allies) at the beginning of each epcoh. Combat resolved by rolling 2 dice, and taking the difference of the dice as your combat strength.  Many things going on with unrest counters, tiles, actions of your opponents, etc. Dicing off in combat, and the usual problems with area control wargames on picking on the leader(s) still leads to a not so good taste in the mouth. The games are long too! Expect 4 hrs for 6 players, and probably five hours with 7 players. Sorry Martin Wallace, I really wanted to like this game, but the dice off in combat makes this game too variable. I suspect this game plays best with 4 players - even number of players so no unbalanced alliances and turns go quicker.

RATING: 7.5
Very, very viscious. In fact, it must be played visciously; otherwise the auctions will be pointless and the balance of the gameplay will break down. A little bit of every Wallace games so far. Great, well thought-out game, but not for everyone I guess.

One of the better Wallace games, but stops short of true greatness due to the silly sea movement rules and the headache-inducing smorgasboard of options open to you from the very first turn.  Also, I see absoulutely no point in playing with only two or three players, even though there'd be a lot less downtime.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game sums up political, scientific, military and expansionist elements into simple game mechanics.  The game has some depth to it, and all the tile options can be a bit daunting to a newbie, so I give it a tad heavier weight because of this, but really, the rules are quite simple.  The strategy is not.  I love empire builder games.  Probably the only part missing in this game is resource management, but it would unnecessarily complicate the game.  It is long, and does lend itself to AP from individuals that are inclined to be so.  The combat system is geniously simple.  I like this game.

Wow! It's rare for me to give a first playng of a game anything over an 8, but SoE is another instant classic by Martin Wallace. Our 5-player game lasted 6 hours (probably an hour or more was spent looking up rules and extra time was need as we were all unfamilair with the tiles and their uses) but it was 6 of the best gaming hours I've spent in a while. In fact, I didn't want to leave the table when it wasn't my turn for fear of missing a key opening that I could exploit on my next turn. This will definitely get a lot of table time despite its length.

Real fun multi-player hybrid. The more the merrier. Not a true wargame but there is always conflict. Has the "angst" of a CDG but there are no cards. You're allowed two actions per turn but you always want to do more than that, hence the "angst" comes in. Very clever design. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a rather good multiplayer conflict game that plays quickly enough. However, this game does feel underdeveloped and it lacks theme (abstract history). Players really need to bash the leader. That is something I do not find that interesting in multiplayer conflicts. Some countries are better than others when it comes to movement. That is not a big issue but an issue nevertheless. What is the real issue is that the initial starting places dictate who can do what. One player can get a very good start. Furtermore, and this is also a big issue, bad luck can easily ruin your chances. You can spend several turns preparing something. Then you try to do it and roll a die. You happen to roll a poor result and you realise that all your efforts were for nothing. That is too harsh! Oh well, at least this game is fun. I want to like it more than I really do. The alliance system is brilliant.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.4
A fun game that suffers from a somewhat out-of-control finish where players make suicide attacks because they know it's the last turn.  

A variable ending would have been much better, and this game loses some points because of this.  However, a fun way to spend 4 hours.

Absolute brilliance.  Area control game that bursts with different paths to victory and yet the game does not have a steep learning curve.  First game you will get a feel for all that is possible and then it's pure gaming bliss. Five or even 6 would be the sweet spot.  Only reason it's not a perfect 10 is it IS a bit lengthy.  Allow 3 hours minimum.

A game with a lot of decisions that seem to have little impact on the final score. Unnecessary "complexity", e.g. the way combat is handled. Why roll 2 dice, then calculate the difference between both rolls when a single dice would have been sufficient?

Very good game, but not perfect. The name is very well chosen as playing it feels like a struggle between the Empires. The rulebook is terrible and the map design could have been so much better. Why waste so much space on UK, France, Spain while you don't need that map piece? Why place water on the border of Germany while you cannot go there with a ship? The alliance piece is the brilliant element in the game, but the random 30 countries markers that appear during the game influence too much what direction the game will take. Also, it is impossible, even with an alliance, to come back and win the game when you had some losses or bad luck with the dice. And then it takes a long time to finish. There are some very good elements for sure and it is a great game to play. But it is inferior in terms of some of the alliance and negotiation game elements that you can find in a game like Diplomacy (which obviously takes even longer to play, but has zero luck and has a flawless design).

It's a multi-player area acquisition with all the normal pluses and minuses. Those tiles that seem to provide so little and yet end up conferring so much drive me nuts I'll confess - no matter what you get, you end up wishing you had something else. My other reservation is that the alliance system is designed to limit the normal leader bash-up, but all it seems to do (in my limited experience) is king-make before the final beat-em-ups happen.

My initial impressions of this game are very positive. It is reminiscent of Empires of the Ancient World, with its simple map, confusing rules, three turns each divided into several rounds, a generic rather than specific historical situation, and a blending of Euro influence game and multi-player wargame mechanics. I think Struggle of Empires is a significant step forward from the earlier game. In particular, the alliance auction is a very clever mechanic which prevents the game from being a typical multiplayer beat-up-the-leader negotiation game.

Martin Wallaces's "posh box" games have been getting better each time, and this one is really rather good indeed. Repeated play has identified several alternative ways to lose this game, but I still have hope. 

Problems? There is a tendency for cash flow to increase towards the end of the game as you get more control markers for your trading companies to work with, but the major unavoidable expenditure occurs right at the start. Maybe there should be ~something~ to spend that huge cash surplus on. Of course, all that money with nothing to spend it on is natures way of telling you that you have been fouling up (see above) but it feels a bit negative.

Based on one play: The initial rules explanation can be long as there are a lot of tiles to be used and some specific that must be explained with the battles and how to get units and markers to areas.Once the game gets going though, it flows very smoothly and passes quickly as you only have two actions per turns, the downtime (of course depending on the players) goes quickly. The game has three "War" periods, the first two are mainly a setup for the large battles in the end to get majority in each territory, since that is where you get points (similar to El Grande). By the end, we all quite enjoyed it and would definitely play again. Worth the three hours.

Bel giocone di scontro di civiltà: come al solito, la regola Risikiana dell'accumulare carrarmatini non paga: meglio raccogliere punti un po' dappertutto, magari spalleggiati da alleati e autoctoni. Il sistema delle alleanze è favoloso: una buona pianificazione in questa fase ti permette di tenerti vicini i tuoi nemici più rognosi, che così non potranno attaccarti. Grafica del tabellone sopra la media dei giochi di Wallace. Infine, un appello ai creatori di giochi: un daltonico si trova in difficoltà con toni di colore poco saturi. Davvero non si può fare nulla?

An initial rating of 7.  I've played it only a couple of times so far, and two-player games at that.  I like it, and I think it's got potential, but I won't get the full flavour until I play some larger games.  Unfortunately the game is plagued by a dreadful rulebook - it's poorly laid out and (partly because of the layout) there are too many ambiguities and areas that are unclear.  Learning it from the rulebook (i.e. without an experienced player to explain things) is a bit of a task, and one really needs to hunt down all the FAQ lists one can find!

How the mighty have fallen!  I used to love this game, mostly due to it's clever design (and it is a terrific design).  That said, repeated plays have revealed it to be lengthy and fiddly with the rules being needlessly convoluted.  The last two times I've played, I've won huge victories through no fault of my own; once I just rolled lucky the entire game and the second time alliances ensured that all worthy opponents were unable to attack me.  Any game that takes 3 hours and grants victory so arbitrarily should be treated with caution.

-

I like this game a lot, although I in my first game I had my frustrating moments when the dice were especially unfriendly. I ended up with a tie for the most "unrest" tokens, which subtract from your total victory points. You get an unrest token every time you lose a battle, which are settled by dice rolling. Even though the dice have a big role in determining battle results, the effect of dice is not blatant and pre-planning for defense and attack and choosing your battles wisely would minimize the luck element. 

The rules are long and you need at least a couple of hours to go over them the first time, and there are lots of various tiles and counters, but the gameplay becomes much more clear after a few rounds and you start to enjoy it. Once players know the rules and are familiar with the various tiles, I don't think a full game will take longer than 3.5 hours.  Good balance for a game in which everyone has the option to attack one or two opponents on their turn. The Alliance feature is a nice mechanic of the game and enhances the long term strategy. This game is worth the time investment.

The game is a combination of History of the World and Age of Steam. Every turn is tense and the option/decisions borders on overload. SoE is the only game to compete well with Dune. SoE has one advantage over Dune in that it is playable with as few as 3 players. The game is intense.

Finally we got our first game in, a 4 hour 5 player fest. This is a fine game from Mr Wallace and worthy of the collection, although a bit long. The calculations for VP's in the last round can get a little much and alliances make a big difference. A good time was had by all but most would prefer POTR because of the time difference. Hopefully, future playings will be shorter.

TRADES: good condition, played a few times. Would move for the right offer but it's not high on my trade list.

Elegant, lean design that captures the essence of expansionist european war games. The only drawback is the somewhat low play enjoyment versus the complexity of the slave revolt and piracy tiles. I'd just as soon play without them to keep the game clean and reduce late round backstabbing.

Wallace játék, de ennek ellenére dühös vagyok rá, mert játék közben nem éreztem, hogy a saját játékomat játszom. többen is úgy éreztük, hogy a kocka oly mértékben beleszólt, ami ilyen hosszban már nem tolerálható kellőképpen. Az én partim, mondjuk nem ezen ment el, hanem az esztelen liciteken amit leműveltem. :) 
szóval csalódtam, és nem mondom, hogy jobb szabályismerettel később nem lesz újabb parti, de most ideges voltam játék közben. Persze ebbe bele tartozott az is, hogy a szabályokat - ami kaotikusnak mondanék - nem a kellő részletességgel ismertem. Jajj, azok a kivételek, meg apró kis szabályszösszenetek. 
Ami még eszembe jutott az a áttekinthetetlen és rettentően praktikátlan(ha van ilyen szó)játéktér.

RATING: 7.25
A great civilization variant with a handful of key mechanics which makes this stand out from the average bulk of civ games. The bidding for alliances bid is an amazing mechanic and really what this whole game is about. Of course, apart from the official alliances, there is no limited as to how many spoken agreement can be made and broken, lots of backstabbing and negotiation going on. I have played it only once but found that some players overreact whenever you become to vicious, despite the fact that the game and theme calls for being ruthless, so be careful who you play with, this is a sure-fire temper riser. The initial setup adds some randomness which makes this game way more re-playable than other civ games. It takes a while to learn all the available upgrades and such by heart but once you manage to, the game is actually very simple. The board and card artwork could do with an overhaul, both in style as well as usability but that is a minor issue. All in all, an above than average civ game which should be your holy grail if you are really into the subject matter. It is not my preferred theme and as I said, I am usually a nasty player and like to be vicious and cruel when playing games which call for it and found that many geeks cannot take it because to them, gaming is everything and they cannot lose. Great game. HX

A Eurogame wargame. Could become a 9 with more plays. A great gateway game for Eurogamers to explore wargaming (add to that list Wallenstein/Shogun). The rules are only five pages long, but don't let that deceive you into thinking it's a simple game. It's a top game for me due to its accessibility to non-war gamers and the alliance aspect, which creates more player interaction.

I really enjoy this game and because the game is always almost different every time (due to the different start up of pieces for all players), it has a strong replay value. I think the game is best played with 5, 6, or 7 players. Some of the best games I have played are with 6 and 7 players. With 7 players, the game takes a little longer but having a 7th player makes the game more intense at times. For example, there are only 6x Army Training tiles (someone doesn't get one) and 3v4 alliances can be helpful or a problem for a player.

RATING: 6.5
The more I play this game (which is not very often considering its length), the less I like it.

Cons:
* This game plods. The only way to get points is to get a majority of control tokens. There is really only one way to get these tokens. Even though there are mechanisms that enable you to secure these tokens more easily (in the form of purchasing special powers), there is no way of getting them faster. Add this to the limited number of actions you can do during your turn, and the fixed number of turns during the game, SoE feels very procedural; there isn't any drama -- there are no "big" moves or dramatic changes of leaders.
     Unfortunately, the only souce of drama is the area-majority scoring mechanic, which is so overused, but for a reason; it effectively creates dramatic swings in scoring.
* Thematically very abstracted and dry. The area-majority scoring as well as the auctioning for alliances don't mesh well with the colonization theme.
* The alliance auction mechanism limits free-for-all attacking, which perhaps stabilizes the game, but because these auctions only happen (I think) three times per game, it feels like it actually limits your options, making the game far less dynamic.

Pros:
* I really like the economic layer in the game in which you are free to choose any special power available. In addition, all powers are affordable at the start of the game so players can pursue different strategies.

Symmary: 
Wallace truly designs Euro-wargame hybrids. The wargame part is always welcome; it introduces direct conflict and dice rolling, but the Euro part -- constraining player actions and conflicts between players and unthematic game mechanisms -- are becoming very tiresome for me.

OK, if someone who enjoys empire building games asked me to recommend SoE, I would. There's a lot to like. So why the 5? Empire building games are themes I would prefer to stay away from. Excessive downtime, tit-for-tat combat, special ability chits spread everywhere and just too long (4 hours with 4 players?) for my tastes.

The only reason I'd play this again is Age of Steam. I actively disliked this the first time I played, but managed to enjoy it with four or less players after several attempts - could the same thing happen here?

Based on only one play with 6 players. Had a great time playing and the time didn't seem to drag as I was having fun. The game seemed to be very well balanced and players always had several options. I really only have a few complaints about this one: The slave revolt tile seems to be too powerful to deal with if it's played on you early. It can really screw you. Initial placement seemed to be way to critical and the random draw of starting positions may put some folks in better/worse position. The board could have been a bit bigger as it gets somewhat congested toward the end of the game. I think some of my opinions of the game will change after some more plays. I expect to move this up to a 9 after the next play. Can't wait. **UPDATED, moving up to a 9.5 after a many plays

There are so many aspects of this game that I really like, it really is a cross between a Euro game and a war game, which I think has been done very well.  Its been recieved well by most groups I've played with and poorly only by one who loved Risk and was expecting something as simple and straight forward and as gamey.

The way the rules are written, however, has made me read them many times very, very carefully.  I think most people I've played this with don't play the full rules for movement because of the way its written.

Non-the-less, it is a fantastic game and well worth the efforts to play and own.

RATING: 6
A good game in the Risk super-family, where you balance various currencies (money population unrest) with your military needs.  It gains marks for trying to regulate player diplomacy with game mechanics.  These mechanics half work, as by joining the same Alliance as your rival you protect yourself from their overt aggression, however you can still be hurt by malicious tile play.  Where they fall down is that non-aggression pacts can as easily go across Alliances as within them, and Alliance partners are not compulsorarily drawn into each other's wars.
Pluses are that the game is fairly clean and fast-playing (for what it is - we're talking 3-4 hours), and not too chaotic given the number of players.  Negatives are that the open availability of all tiles makes the first few turns very important but tricky for new players, that leader bashing is still the main factor, there are a few mis-judged chromey/lucky rules such as sinking on sea voyages, the system is a bit too grainy so losing a battle involving a couple of units is a major disaster.

Strong Martin Wallace multiplayer design which definitely improves with replays. The tempo and value of tile draws in the game changes with the number of players and strategies shift with shifting groupthink.

An area control/influence game played over three rounds (wars), each including auctioning for alliances, troop introduction and movement, tile acquisition for development, and dice-based conflict to gain/replace influence. Auctioning to newly define alliances at the start of each round allows players to use gold to build or break support and is unique, making gold more important than you think. Movement rules are somewhat confusing, and should have been simplified. The dice mechanic for battle attempts to be different (calculation of the *difference* between two rolls) but may as well have been simplified, as it adds nothing new from a strategy and tactics standpoint. Components are fiddly and not as good as the wooden bits introduced in the Treefrog line; although the rules are easy to learn and very well written. Lots of luck introduced by the dice -- I prefer more strategy.

RATING: 8
Like most of Wallace's games this is best played with experienced players, since the alliance phase is the crucial aspect of the game.

Not sure if an odd number of players would make a difference.

With new players it would seem common for some players to get behind and stay behind. but with experienced players it would seem that the alliances would be conducive to catching up.

The basic strategy would seem to have a power region and have the company tile for that region, then try to get a presence in as many of the other regions as possible. 

First in a region is great but difficult to hold without a lot of effort. Several second places in regions, especially Europe is essential to staying competitive.

RATING: 6.75
I would certainly like to play this in future but I have some doubts about it. It is exactly what you would expect from Martin Wallace does Diplomacy - tiresome, fiddly, full of little bits of card board. When Knizia does a classic game (like Stratego/Rat & Elephant) he bores down to the essence of the game and produces something new and fresh. Wallace somehow layers bits on top without ever quite convincing you there is anything new in the game.
This must sound like I hate the game, but I don't. It has clever elements - in the game players bid to be parts of particular alliances which hads a whole level of subtelty I had not really considered to it. Its just that I could list quite a long list of other games covering very similar ground which given the choice I would play in preference.

Great game - very much a Euro-wargame, it feels quite a bit like El Grande with combat, where players are competing for 1st/2nd/3rd place area majorities.  The bidding for who you're allied with and who you're opposing each of 3 wars is the most novel aspect of the game and quite an elegant way to simulate unstable, changing alliance, compared to something like the more complex alliance tracks in Napoleonic Wars.  Downtime can be a bit high with 7 players, especially if your plans get blocked and you don't have much to do effectively towards the end of each War.  There's no attempt to be historical really, which means it doesn't really matter which country you play to pursue the strategy you want. I do prefer the semi-historical nature of Imperial where each county does tend to have a common strategy from game to game even if that doesn't really match anything historical.  Which tiles you take really dictates what type of strategy you're going to pursue that game, in addition to the starting locations of your 5 control markers. The "map" is very abstracted in terms of movement, which can be a bit difficult to grasp (e.g. you can't move armies by land to adjacent areas in the Americas - you just need to have a ship in the area you're moving to).  And combat can be surprisingly swingy, even with the odd nature of the dice rolling (adding the difference between 2d6 to your army strength).  But all that said, it's an amazing game for someone looking for a large-player count Euro with combat.

Mmmmmmm, Martin Wallace goodness....! This is a game that I try and play every chance I get, but never seem to be able to get it on the table. Much more an Area Influence game that a Wargame, I feel that this is almost the very definition of a Waro. You only get two actions per turn, and they can be whatever you want. Although there is about 10 things you want to do, and if you don't do at least 4 of them, your screwed!  I love the "cards" in this game, that are actually rectangular counters, and the artwork and bit quality are beautiful. Units are all generic, and only the countries with influence counters on them (drawn randomly at the beginning of each round (of which there are three)) can be targeted for VP's. Influence counters can also only be replaced, never added, except through the random drawings. So once a player takes it over, it must be converted by another player, by attacking! The person with the most Influence markers in a country at the end of a round recives that countries max VP's. There are lower VP amounts for second place, and sometimes even some for third. Attacking is pretty easy, and fairly common, considering it has to take place in order for players to win. The action "cards" give some advantages, and helps with certain situations. There is an economic factor also, which is called Unrest, and you get that if you can't pay for your armies, or other things, and the person with the most Unrest immediatly loses the game, at final scoring. There is also the famed alliance mechanic. At the beggining of each round, there is an auction for who's on who's "team". If you have an alliance with somebody, then you can't attack them. This brings the value of money up very high. Rich players can guarantee that thier closest rival can't attack them, and vice versa. It can be very interesting, with many a back stabbed. I really like this game for its Area Influence aspect, abstract movement, and the alliance factor.

Too many players required for this to run properly (6-7), making downtime significant. It's a long game and not easy on new players, as assessing the value of particular tiles is difficult without experience, while wrong choices will hurt you badly later on. I might like it better nowadays, when I'm more experienced with heavier games than when I first tried it in 2009, but I'm not that sure.

"constant warfare" (as the period is referred to in the Historical settings) is a good description of the game too. I felt a little disappointed that the game is essentially an all out wargame. And I mean all out. The rules are muddled and need a serious dose of editing to give them a structure. Additionally the rules are vague and ambiguous - as is the board. Very disappointing that yet again certain things in a Warfrog game didn't seem very well thought out - such as the third victory point level in the Ottoman Empire that can never be achieved. Once again Wallace has come so close and unfortunately overshot the mark.Simplifying some of the rules might have been a good start - my poor little brain is never going to remember all the ifs and buts in the rules between games. (Perhaps the designer could have got rid of square symbols on tiles and just made them the same as the dark grey keep and use once only tiles. Maybe put rope between North America, the Caribbean and South America - Spain to Morocco too. Copper coins = one gold, while silver coins = five gold? Huh? Who thought that up? What about following convention and make small gold = one gold and large gold = five gold?  Don't write sentences in the rules like "Naval combat and land combat follow the same rules- Each army/navy has a value of one. Forts have a value of 2 when defending..." You know it's not unheard of in real life for some forts to defend against attack from the sea - I certainly misinterpreted this rule until I read the contradiction by the designer, and etc.)One feature of the game I like is the combat dice roll system. The probability of a high number outcome versus a low number is very clever, and  extra losses on a roll of seven is brilliant. Another redeeming factor is that it's a good multiplayer wargame if played regularly. Finally, it just seemed to be the wrong game for my group - it was a bit too rule heavy for them.

Players are European Powers trying to control colonies and influence minor countries in the Old Continent with a majority system.  If you like a game with much fighting this is your choice.  Hard to learn, cause there are many tiles involved that modify the abilities of the players.  It has also a peculiar and a bit complex battle mechanic.  The movement method turns very hard to asure control of the areas, cause is easy to move troops from everywhere.  Another great Wallace's game.

After the first play, I thought about this on the drive home and the next day. This was by far the least "fiddly" Wallace game I've played. All of the mechanics seemed straightforward and made sense in the context. I love all of the different tiles--it allows for various strategies to try out, and you can combine some into interesting and cool "combos." I don't think the luck is out of whack--though good heavens, one guy had rotten luck with the dice. I lost 3 ships myself to bad dice...and if I pursue a "colonial strategy" again, I'd probably pick Navigation early. 

The auction for alliances and turn order is a great mechanic. It's a tense and vital part of the game--underestimate it at your peril. 
A winner for me. I'd definitely play this again, and it proves that Martin Wallace can produce a nonfiddly game that just works.

Update: Played again, and it might be a 10. What a great game.

Very good wargame with euro elements. Although grognards might say the opposite. The "alliance" mechanism is very interesting, especially since it's tied to an auction, but this works best with an even number of players. Only thing I don't like is the big platter of cards you can buy - right from the outset you need to study the cards to know what to buy or you'll get reamed. I prefer games that ease you into your choices, rather than relying on my weak eyes to read two dozen cards across the table. But once you know them it's okay. If we're in the mood for a medium-plus wargamey take-that kind of experience this is a good pick.

WARNING - This is not a game that you will just be able to jump into.  It takes about 45 minutes to explain to complete newbies.  Once you get through all of the rules and nuances, there will be some plodding through the first war.  IF you can keep everyone with you for that long, you will be rewarded with a VERY fun experience, that plays fairly quickly, especially if you are thinking about what you are going to do during the other players' turns.  The alliance swapping via the bidding system is very fun as is the blatant extortion and blackmail.  It takes some work to get into, but you'll be rewarded if you stick it out.

Покупая игру переживал за требовательность к количеству игроков и к избытку военных действий. Конечно, интересней играть, как и в большинство подобных игр, в неё большим составом, и конечно войны здесь много. Однако требование к количеству игроков не критично (втроём проходят вполне полноценные партии - аукцион за Союзы-Порядок проходит при этом так же вполне интригующе), да и война представляет собой скорее тактическое соперничество нежели стратегическое. Немного великовато количество бросков кубика. Так же после 5 партий игра уже не кажется столь вариабельной, как это кажется в самом начале. Но такое с играми Мартина нашего случается:)

The thing I like most about SoE is that it is a multiplayer conflict game that is structured in such a way that it doesn't produce a Risk style free-for-all.

Dry amalgam of war- and eurogame. Has neither fixed nor free alliances, which embezzles player interaction by neglecting both team-play and backstabbing.

There are only two ways to gain influence in countries and therefore victory points: 

1) Combat. Bad idea if you and your opponent are the only ones who battle it out, because this'll costs you the game. 

2) Luck. Initial set-up and random events that happen to occur when it's your turn.

There are some clever design ideas, but the game suffers from all drawbacks a victory point track bestows upon a multiplayer-game. It also drags on too long.

Sok jó ötlet, amit elront egy kicsit az a fránya kockadobálás. Röviden így tudnám összefoglalni a SoE-t. Minden játékos egy nagyhatalmat irányít, akik 3-szor 6 kört játszanak 4 játékos esetén. 6 kör után van pontozás a jelenlegi elfoglalt területek szerint. 11 területért megy a harc, ami mint az El Grandéban pontot ad, az ott elhelyezkedő befolyásszámunk után. Minden helyen a második helyezett is kap pontot, néhány helyen a harmadik is. A játékban hajó és szárazföldi egységek vannak, a harc pedig kockadobással dől el. Jó ötlet, hogy a hajók csak támogatják a szárazföldi erőket, az ő csatájuk csak a támogatás eldöntéséről szól. Jó ötlet, hogy legrosszabb kockadobás esetén is maximum két egysége veszhet a vesztesnek. Két kockával dob mindkét fél és a két kocka különbségéhez adja hozzá a csatában szereplő egységeinek számát, illetve egyéb bónuszait. A nagyobb értékkel rendelkező győz és cserélhet egy ott levő befolyásjelzőt a sajátjára az ellenfélétől. Az ellenfél egy egységet veszít, bármelyik fél hetes dobása esetén az adott fél még egyet. A játék ott kompenzál a rossz dobásért, hogy a kör végén minden egység pénzbe kerül, kevesebb egységgel több bevételünk lesz. A játékot a különböző lapkák dobják föl, amik különböző bónuszokat nyújthatnak a harcban vagy pénzbevételben. A pénz a csaták indításához kell, illetve lapkák szerzéséhez. Új egység felállítása popuplációpontba kerül, amiből mindenki 3-szor kap 5 darabot. Ez is egy jó megoldás. A legérdekesebb része a játéknak a diplomácia eldöntése. A megfelelő játékos két játékost beállíthat, akik egymással szemben állnak az adott nagykörben, ezt több pénz beadásával teljesen megváltoztathatja más és ez így tulajdonképpen licitálással dől el. Ez dönti el az adott nagykör játékossorrendjét is. Tehát nagyon más lehet ki kivel van egy-egy nagykörben. Ez nagyon ötletes rész. A kockadobás ellenére teljesen kiegyenlített volt a játék. Szóval nagyon vegyes az összkép. Érezhetően jó játékról van szó, de az ilyen kockásoknál mindig benne van az, hogy ha valaki rosszul dob sokszor, akkor nincs esélye sajnos. Látszik, hogy komolyan van tesztelve és mivel az élmény is jó volt így 7-est adok rá, főleg mert négyen is tökéletesen működött, többen pedig még jobb lehet véleményem szerint.

War for the sake of war. Enslavement. Colonial oppression. Didn't like this game at all.

If dice have to be rolled, the designer needs to make sure they're rolled enough times for luck to even out in the long run. Don't take the middle path.

While this game is certainly not trying to be a historical simulation in any specific sense, I am still very impressed with the way it does distill and convey the major strategic issues faced with 18th century powers, culminating with the threat of the French revolution in background (represented by unrest). Seen purely as a game, this is certainly one of Wallace's most inspired systems.

As a downside, I am disturbed by the generic feel each power has, and have hence proposed minimalist adjustments to set-up which might affect balance and re-playability but certainly also help giving the game some historical plausibility (see Variants section on the game's page). to my taste, that greatly improves the overall experience.

RATING: 10
What a great game.  The Alliance/Turn order decision is brilliant.  Too many tough choices for what little action that you have makes this gripping right up to the end. I'm so glad that they decided not to call it Birth of Nations.  

It really feels like you are building your Empire from the ground up.  The theme is emersive and works well with all the different upgrades or bonuses you can get.  Keeping the balance between keeping up with the tile race and grabing position on the board is vital.  I love the way that Unrests works.  The game just amps up as you progress.  

This game gets a 9 with an even number of people and a 10 with an odd number of players.  I now only pursue this with 5 or 7.  Crazy things happen when you stack odd alliances.  

Tons of great choices with too little ability to do them from beginning till the end, Wallace shinning as usual.

"'Almost' only counts in horseshoes and hand-grenades"

Oh i was so disappointed playing this one.
To me, the strategic opportunities (which are there, for sure), are simply not enough to overcome the luck factor: variance is too high when you look at the difference of two dice, and to worsen (is that even a word?) the deal, the luck doesn't only come from combat and dice, but it is there in the setup (initial token placement) and when drawing natives, which can go horribly wrong.
Mind you, i often don't mind luck in games when it's well balanced and highly mitigable, but this is not the case here.
The only really interesting mechanic is the auction when choosing alliances. 5 minutes of fun in a 3 hour experience. This is not the kind of game i wanna play.

The rules are pretty simple - the complexity comes from the abilities the various (37?) tiles give you, and from the interesting alliance mechanism! The unrest markers are equivalent to share markers in Age of Steam - ya gotta take 'em to play, but if you take too many you lose. 
My first game (7er, 6 newbies) dragged on way too long. I'd guess that 4 or 5 player game would be ideal, although my 3er game (with timer - works great!) worked surprisingly well! I wish we could get it to the table more!

Outstanding blend of wargame with Euro-mechanics.  Very tight economics and overall game decisions, you feel like you are on a tightrope trying to keep everything in balance.  The alliance/turn order bidding is one of the best auction phases of a game I have experienced.  It very well may be my favorite individual game phase I have ever experienced.  Combat resolution is streamlined making it very easy to figure out, yet makes for tense decisions when committing to an attack.

Strategy is rendered completely irrelevant by blind luck, and woe be to the player who leads after the first war.  It's true, most other war games involve dice, but I've never seen a war game so utterly dominated by the vagaries of random chance as Struggle, except perhaps Risk.  Vastly, inexplicably overrated.

Great game by Wallace. Alliance system is great and so is map play (movement, battles, reinforcement, conversion). Some rules exception for thematic sake could be trimmed off, but otherwise small ruleset considering the heaviness and time it takes to play. Art design is terrible though. It's often hard to know who has what power and distinguish colours.

You need a tolerance for certain things when playing: luck of the dice, shifting alliances, getting beat down, etc. You also need a learning game because it's hard to gauge what's good the first time you play. For a game this long, it can turn off player to be eliminated in the second war.

It'd get an 8 from me if it weren't just a little on the longish side.

Based on two three player games.  I think it will move it if playing with 5 or more, but I need to get a game in to be sure.  With three, the alliance system and diplomacy aspects don't have a very large impact.

I love the unlimited funds for unrest transfer and the tile system.  El Grande is one of my 2-3 favorite games and if the multiplayer really works here this could be El Grande plus!

Problems: the rulebook is below average, and I don't like that your starting country is not as important as the five random tiles you draw.  Couldn't there be a better way to do it than random?  There is also an issue with some starting countries just being better than others because they border more countries.  Since your home country can't be attacked there is no reason to want to be spain rather than Austria that I can tell - am I missing something?

Very excited to play with 5+ players.

RATING: 5.75
A very "meh" game to me. The mechanisms are extremely clunky and are very typical of a Martin Wallace design. There are weird rules for movement to colonies, with rolling a 1 on a d6 and then a 1-2 kills, 3-4 sends back, and 5-6 completes. Extremely complex and arbitrary for no real reason. Also, the combat has both sides rolling 1d6 - 1d6 and adding it to their attack value, which gives a very large variance in combat results.

Additionally, there is a large amount of randomness in what influence tiles are drawn, and an even more pigeonholing effect through your starting influence locations.

Also, the improvement tiles are grossly overpowered. The extra free units are extremely clutch in comparison to some of the others.

Besides all that (which is a lot of faults) there are some interesting mechanisms involved. I did enjoy the alliance system, that really made you think about positioning and placement. But for the type of game it is, I'd rather just play a better area control type game.

RATING: 4
This game is a tough game to rate.  I can see the brilliance in the design, but it's not my kind of game so I would trade it away, hence 4.  The alliance system is really cool; it has such a huge effect on the outcome of the three wars.  The myriad of tiles that you can buy give everyone the ability to pursue divergent strategies.  The die add a bit of unpredictability to a decent combat system.  But at the end of the day it's still a game of combat and you win by having a decent strategy and trying not to get bashed on very much. 2009/05/03

This is a difficult game to rate after one play. The game is an area majority, conflict game over three phases. The in game decisions around special abilities, unit creation, movement and economics are difficult and seem to have a range of subtlety and nuance. This is pure Martin Wallace, 'black cubes', two actions per turn stuff, slightly dry in presentation whilst still being thematic in play and with enough weird rules to keep you coming back to the rulebook. This is the type of game I love but it is long and the production quality could be higher but those are minor issues. 

My big concern is that these decisions might be overshadowed by the alliance phase where players bid to place each other into one of two temporary alliances, the outcomes of which can make or break any strategy. It is also possible to be knocked out of the running and still have to play for another hour or two. As games for up to 7 players go this is awesome, and it didn't hurt that I scraped a 1 point victory.

Played this game for the first time this past weekend.  I am already hooked and cannot wait to play this one again! I think after a few more plays, it could be a 10.  Easy game to explain.  Not a ton of time is spent having to teach it to others.  It is a fun, light wargame!  I see the complaints about luck being involved, and yes, there is some luck in it, but how many games don't have some degree of luck?  If people complain about luck, then they'll be complaining about all games for the rest of their life.  Granted, some games have more luck and dice involved than others, but I found this one to have a great balance of both.  Everyone should play this one at least once.....but after that first play, I can guarantee you'll want to play it again!

Simple yet deep, with high player interaction, and lots of choices each turn without being overly complex.  This is my favorite game.  Requires some House Rules to make a two-player game work best, but it is possible to play with that player count.  It takes some time to learn about what all the different tiles do; however, the rule book is small and straightforward.  It is by no means a historically simulation (Germany colonizing South America or India?), but having the freedom to explore all the possibilities is fun.

Good mixture between war game and german kind in Wallace style. Tiles power remember "Princess of Renaissance" but they are really too much for me, the map is enough abstract balancing games movements but the game seems starting with a not well balanced situation. It's too "heavy" for my taste but it's really a good game for who like this mix. Visible victory points drives too much players in their diplomatic choice, IMO.

Martin Wallace games just don't do it for me.

An okay wargame that's actually not a wargame, but the buildings from AoE III with penalties for doing anything.

It reminds me of a joke from Red Dwarf where (badly paraphrased) AoE III would be a case of you start with a score of zero and for everything that you do well, you gain points. In SoE, it takes the French/Satre approach and you start with 100% and lose points for everything you do badly.

I find that less than fun.

I feel like it was missing something. It just felt a bit too...constrained compared to Pax Britannica.

Actually I can nail down what I dislike about this game. The alliance system.  If I want to be peaceful, I can...but technically, I'm always at war. Always. That bothers me a lot.  Hence my preference for Pax Britannica.

All the alliance system does is add an artificial Euro-style element into a game that should be purely diplomatic in nature. And that rubs me the wrong way.

Just learning the rules now and waiting for the right opportunity to bring this one out. I'm excited to give it a go.

1/11/13 - After one play, this is in my top 10. In fact, it's #2 currently. There is a solid economic system driving the conflict throughout the entire game, which I love! Especially when the economy has been created by Wallace. Perhaps that's why I love it so much, because while I don't usually gravitate to a dudes-on-a-map type game. But this one stands alone as one with many more interesting decisions, that go beyond the typical war-game questions (like "Who do I attack this turn?"). 

If you can get a solid bunch of players together, that have enough time to dedicate to a longer, but nail-biting experience, and you want a war game that feels like an economic war as much as a blood war, I don't think there's a better option than Struggle of Empires.

RATING: 6.5
I give it 6.5. It doesn't excite me but usually if I give something a 6.0 it is tending towards inherently flawed.

I was surprised, not in a bad way, by how abstract this is. The movement restrictions are just enough to make it seem like it's really a world map. I also really like how there is a limited amount of control to fight over. If you want presence in a region, it's at somebody else's expense. You don't create colonies out of thin air just by "placing influence cubes" or something.

The alliance system is nice, making it harder to directly smack whoever you want to fight. Though it does seem a little weird to use cash to bid on it. Also, whenever the system [i]doesn't[/i] restrict you, I sometimes feel disturbingly little guidance from the game regarding who I should go attack.

I wish the game were simpler. You have to take unrest tokens to borrow money, but you can only borrow what you need. Makes almost all transactions very tedious. I think there are a few too many different tiles also. Quite daunting at first.

As an area control game, what seems missing is some natural way for the controller of an area to lose control. One is likely to become dominant in a region or two, and hard to oust. It's worth more points to have smaller presence in a larger number of regions, but this is both harder to defend, and makes you a leader that people want to bash.

The game is made up of three "wars," and it takes most of a war to pull off a task like "go here and knock the guy who owns it out of there." I just don't get the feeling that much happens or that it will be very surprising.

...I wish I had taken more notes on what happened. Despite everyone knowing who needed to be bashed in the third war, that leader still won the game easily. It's alarming to wonder if the game was already decided. But it could be that I just don't understand the game well enough.

Learnt to play this back-to-back with learning to play Power Grid, which was not the best plan - my brain was left dribbling from my ears after 6-7 hours between the two.

Long, a bit fiddly, but very much worth the effort.  There is so much to think about, and never anywhere near enough resource to do all the things you want to do - everything you accomplish feels like an achievement.

The ever-changing alliances mean screwage is kept reasonable, as you almost certainly will be back teamed with the person you backstabbed later in the game.  It prevents a runaway leader from beating up on *everyone* at once too.

I can't ever seeing myself getting the time it deserves for repeated plays to really learn it though.

RATING: 7
A dizzying array of choices that vex even seasoned gamers.  More paths to victory that Catan has sheep.  But even the best player can be foiled by unlucky dice rolls.  In my first-ever game, two of the heavyweights at the table were compeletey robbed by a series of unlucky rolls.  I ended up tying for the victory.  Interesting, but I can think of more fun & exciting ways to spend 6 hours at the game table.
I've been thinking about this today, and think my initial reaction was too harsh.  The bidding-for-allies-&-turn-order mechanic in the game is excellent: for two wars we didn't care very much what happened, in the third, the bidding was furious, with players pooling money to get their desired result.  The luck factor was manageable to a certain degree (though truly bad rolls, like x y=7 or 1 1, REALLY hurt).  Whittling down your possible actions to two per turn was interesting, as is the civil unrest factor, which helped me tie for the win.  Finally, the shifting alliances caused people who had helped each other in previous wars to go toe-to-toe just minutes later.

I finally got to "play" this one, well at least through one war.  We are typically a slow group, so I knew it would be hard to fit in the time allowed.  Once we got going, I was surprised at how fast it was moving.  The problem was that it really wasn't going all that fast, it only seemed that way.

I was surprised at how tight the actions were during the first war.  I thought the number of options would be overwhelming, and maybe it was at first, but once the easy country tiles started to dry up, so did the available actions. It was an alliance of three against two, and I was on the two side.  The two of use became the only source of additional control markers, and there was no way to defend everything.  Once they had picked off the easy targets, we could afford to make our remaining holdings a more expensive target.  The war ended just as the situation was becoming really tight, and while I have only played this one partial game, I bet that tension is no accident.

I look forward to seeing how the character of the game changes in wars 2 and 3.  We could have continued the game later, but we decided to start our next game from scratch to benefit from our new experience.

I got this to the table and loved it. It's not really a wargame (with more than 2, anyway), although there is some combat. Money is tight, and attacking costs money, so you really have to make your attacks count and only attack where it will help you, not just hurt someone else. Sometimes you just have to settle for second place in a region in order to be first overall.

One play with 6.  I preferred it to Princes of the Renaissance, but wouldn't rush to play it again.  There was much I liked about the mechanics of the game - the set number of rounds, the action point system, the majority scoring, the tiles giving special abilities/bonuses, and most of all, the alliances.  However, the importance of combat and the use of dice in it were turn-offs for me, as was the game length (which presumably would have been less with only 4 players).

The bidding toward alliances, unrest and asymmetric play are neat. The rulebook is basically a tire fire and the map looks like wet garbage.

Gets better with every play.  Masterful flourishes take a vanilla area-majority game and turn it into a wonderfully nuanced and thematic piece.  The alliance system is mind-bending, the money always tight, and the unrest a work of genius.  The interleaving between the tiles is both easily grasped and subtle.  There's even space for negotiation and bribery.  This is the best Wallace game I've played, and I like a lot of his efforts.  It's crisper and less wonky that most of his war-themed games, and it's less dry than his economic affairs.  There's fewer gotcha rules in this game than the others, and the whole comes together very clearly.  The ability to share ties for area majority also means that there is a symbiosis possible that is very unique.  Make sure you play it with 5+ players, preferably 6 or 7 to get the most out of the alliance system.

The alliance mechanic in SoE is the most ingenious solution I have ever seen to the bash-the-leader problem in multi-player conflict games. My friend calls this "Risk-done-right" and I agree- this is my favorite dudes on a map game by far. The "you count the difference between the two dice" system elegantly condenses the probability distribution to make results feel less arbitrary while still delivering the hope and drama of unexpected outcomes on occasion. Make no mistake Princes of the Renaissance is the deeper and more interesting game, but SoE is just plain fun. The myriad of special tiles add that chrome which really enhances the flavor of the game. Best with 5 or 7!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's a combination wargame/area control game (two games that aren't quite my thing), but it intrigues me.  It has a nice balance and some interesting things happening to keep my interest and burn my brain, and it's common to wish that you had one extra move on your turn to complete what you really want to do.  It has a good turn angst, but it also has a lot of down time, with not much that you can do until it's your turn, since so much can happen between them.  I'd like to play it some more.

Anything that gives you something for free or an additional action. Be careful with how many battles you try and take on, the unrest markers can definitely add up, as battles are hard to predict.

I quite like this game; it's not quite as flavourful as Liberté, and not quite as well balanced or developed as Age Of Steam. But it's definitely one of Wallace's better efforts.

After owning this game since it was released, I dared to play this game at last on 18 DEC 2005... Not that it's a difficult game, but this was for me the first time that the Warfrog rules were hard to grasp. On reading it makes all sense, but a solo-play gave me many questions and I kept rereading the rules. I own Age of Steam, Liberté, Prinses of the Renaissance and Empires of the Ancient World, but the rules of these games gave me less problems. So I waited until the game was fully covered here on BGG before I picked this game up again.

The player aids here on BGG, especially Innovan's work (compliments on his FAQ/Quick Reference/Sheets for Tiles and Country counters), was just the right stuff I needed to teach and play SoE.

My first game was a 2 player learning game with a friend of mine. The few questions I didn't know directly from the rules and the FAQ were all covered in the FAQ. Then I played the game on my regular gaming club. A four player game, 3 newbies...

Two of them had checked the game out here on BGG on my advice. The third one was completely blank on the game. Board setup/ Rules explenation took about 45 minutes. We started playing, it went smoothly. All my preparations on this game really helped.

It took us 3 hours to finish the game. Time flew by, it's a tense game with so much to want and only 2 actions on a turn. I ended dead last with -7 points for first place on unrest. I had 55 points, number 3-60 points, number 2-62 and number 1-64 points.

With the right tiles you can conquer the dice. Maybe one/two times the dice were against a player.

People who like games like Vinci and/or Wallenstein, should try and play this one. One warning; this game takes a (maybe too) steap learning curve if no one has prepared this game well. I personally think people will not enjoy this game without someone who has really prepared the first session; because people will start asking questions and you better know most answers...otherwise you will be playing a 'rules reading game'.

Also; Just reading the rules and playing the game is asking for trouble in my opinion. The FAQ is essential!

You can find it at Innovans site, look at the link section for SoE. After reading and rereading this file and using his player aids the game fell in place for me.

Recommended gamers-game! I've put it from my HOT 10 list to my PERSONAL TOP 10.

Simply super.  A historical game similar to El Grande with many more options, more accuracy, and more depth.  Not for the casual gamer.  A Eurogame with a wargame flavor.

Well, there sure is a lot going on here.  Finally got to play with 5 players, and it was excellent.  My group feels that 5 is optimal.  Very strong, interesting game.  I will a have a more developed opinion when I play it a few more times.  This one is a keeper.

Very good game.  It seemed a bit long, but there is plenty of meat here!

UPDATE - Its kind of funny, I have played this and loved it, but I have not had the urge to play this one again.  Downgrading to a 7 for now.

 I haven’t played this in years. I remember it as a fun game. The fact that you swift the alliance forces you to think in the long term. I think that the player who had been in the lead before the last war always lost..
But nowadays I never have time or enough friends in one session to play a game with seven people...

210305 purchased. First game 6 plyr. started at 8 and finished the 2nd war at midnight, so roughly taking 2 hrs per war. We were a bit slow and initially I quite like it. Give it a 7 to begin. Would like to try with 5 maybe..Next game was with f and we played in about 4-5 hours with 3 newbies. Rating goes up and did well until the last war where I was the perceived leader and was crucified for being the big threat, coming in at 2nd to last but took 4 unrest also in my final maintanence phase cause I was never lucrative, ending with 19 unrest and sharing the first-most unrest penalty (-7 vps!). Good game. You've got to manage you armies, unrest, money and influence and at the same time juggle alliances and much diplomacy. rates an 8 now. Third game I was in the wrong alliance and almost was pushed right out of the game by the end of war 2. But this game gets props for allowing a player to never really being out of the game and caught up to the pack on the final war. Still running a little long for my liking..over 4 hours with 5. but the game is so tense, 2 of us went away with a pretty nasty headache...

RATING: 7
Players often end up overcommitting their troops and control markers to certain scoring areas, which ends up spiraling into an even further committal by the same players.  The end result: troop mobility and the  opportunities for scoring points both become extremely limited.

Still, the whole engine is run by a bid-for-enemies mechanic that is truly inspired.  And I do enjoy it (mostly) while it's happening.  Just not, I recall, with more than five players.

Like a cross between El Grande and Princes of the Renaissance, both of which are much more enjoyable. The changing alliances from turn to turn are a nice touch.

Only played this twice, and did well both times (first, second) but then it is a game that suits my playing style well.  Simple combat, a lot of development options and a unique (as far as I know) diplomacy phase where everyone ends up on one or two opposing teams, and something that you can bid on. This really makes the game!  Very frustrating if you end up on teh same side as someone who you want to take out, they can cock their thumb at you, at least until the next turn! Takes a long time to set up and expect to be playing for 4 hours or more in a 6 player game.

In reading the comments here its a bit surprising how many people don't know how to control randomness. They think to have an advantage is cause enough to trust to luck and roll the dice.  A good player will only fight with [b]strong[/b] odds and use money to control alliances to always have (1) aliances where they want aid to atack non-allies and  (2) alliances where they want immunity from combat.

(Trade Interest: low) this is another pretty good game by Wallace.  while it is good, it does not hit the table very often.  not sure why.  maybe because there's just too many other better games, with similar mechanics.

I have yet to play this enough times to really appreciate all of it's ins and outs, but so far it's been quite a brain burner. As with most really good games, there just isn't enough time to get everything you want done ... and the neighbours crapping on your lawn doesn't help either. Best sick the natives after them so they leave you alone!
Will play this any time it nears a table!

Enjoyable enough. I wasn't wowed by it but then again I did play one 6.5 hour game and didn't get bored. If you like keeping multiple threads in your head and working for your own ends while also thwarting those of others it can be a lot of fun. I like the general idea and strategies involved as well as the overall thematic feel of warring empires. I didn't feel compelled to run out and buy it right away, but I would definitely play again.

After 1 Play: Some interesting mechanics, but it also has the flaws common to multiplayer direct-confrontation games. I enjoyed the first 1/2 of my play, but I was starting to zone out around the 6 hour mark. Honestly, I'm just not going to commit 7 hours to a game that's anything less than flawless.

RATING: 7
Good game. The alliances are shifting so fast that they mean virtually nothing. It is short-term Realpolitik that matters. The only thing I personally lack in the game is the symmetry between players. I would have preferred each power to have a unique trait, if nothing else in order to make players change strategies when taking charge of a new country. You will learn little about the time period, but it is a eurogame after all.

Finally played it. Many people whine about the length or the luck factor.
-Time passed really quickly
-If the dice were not there, the analysis paralysis would be huge and the game would last around 8 hours in our group (just like AGoT).

Pros: neat historic sweep, the tile powers

Cons: TOO LONG. Not enough happens. Debt-rule problem. Alliance mechanic deepens runaway effect. Tiles might not be priced correctly (reliant on order bidding to sort of correct), and a handful are very powerful. Combat results a bit too variable. You should probably should cap your die diff result to 3 (and perhaps just roll 1d6/2 round down?), and maybe tone down the extra casualty on '7's to some weaker penalty.

Likely needed more development. Might be excusable if the game were 2 hours long instead of 7.

4/24/09 -- After 1.5 plays, I'm rating this a 6.  A fairly solid game, especially considering it's predecessor, the disastrous Princes of the Renaissance.  In general, longer multiplayer games hold a lot of appeal for me, but I tend to not like big leader-bashing/kingmaking end-game scenarios, which this game has bigtime.  In Struggle of Empires, you try to stay conspicuously in 2nd or 3rd place right up until the end, and then try to time a power grab for first at just the right time after having tried to convince everyone else to take down the leader.  For me, this just isn't very interesting, and I'd rather play something where the designer has at least made an effort to address this (rather common) issue.  Dune, Cosmic Encounter, Civilization and Titan, for example (all big, multi-player games), all provide differing and effective mechanisms for avoiding this problem.

A very tense multiplayers-game.

This is not a simulation game.

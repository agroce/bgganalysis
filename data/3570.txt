Great fun.

RATING: 5
This is just a stupid race game that lasts too long, and doesn't allow for any strategy as recourse for children with not so fantastic memories.  

That one kid with the fantastic memory will kick the butts of the other children.  How is that fun?

Nice little kids memory based games. Chase other chickens around the Board trying to steal their feathers by matching turned over tiles with their equivalent face up stepping stones. Can be tailored to different sizes (2 to 4) and different lengths by adding or subtracting tiles. My 5 year old loves this as do younger visitors. My wife and I regularly get beaten by him which is a depressing commentary on how poor our memories have gotten as we get older. Highly recommended.

When playing with kids this is a fine game. The forever loop I mentioned earlier doesn't seem to happen much.

I don't see how this is better than Memo. And I do see how it is worse: if there are two players of similar skill and luck the game takes forever to finish.

RATING: 7.5
A delightfully produced memory game with such a simple ruleset of flip and look - trying to keep some 12 different images in place in your mind. Once accomplished by a player, the game nearly instantly ends (lapping all opponents). It has incredible wooden chickens, colorful illustrations and is charming in every way. The youngest of children and adults alike will find this game very enjoyable!

RATING: 7.5
I'm rating this as a kid's game.  It's lots of fun.  Ok, so it's just a memory game, BUT as memory games go it's one of the best - Shicki Micki, also about chickens, is pretty good, too.  It's colourful and well themed and it draws you in whether you're an adult or a child.

The pieces and card art are lovely.  If you have kids under 7, they'll love it and older ones will like it, too.

Rated as a kid's game.
Quite fun to play with my 3 year old (not exactly by the rules). It's nice how the memory aspect naturally leads to the game's conclusion (i.e. as the players get to know where the tiles are, the game accellerates to the end)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

My kids love this, and so anything that gets them gaming more is a good thing. And with the memory component to it, my 6 and 4 year olds can stay competitive with me!

I play this with my two daughters (7 and 9).

The components are very high quality.  The chickens are large  enough for little kids to easily hold them.

And this is one of those games kids will beat you at most every time.

I won't rate this because I have no idea how I would have responded to it if I had played it as a child.  I probably would have liked it because I have a pretty good memory.  As an adult playing with children, it is too easy for me, making it frustrating for them.  If I were to play a game of this genre, I would choose Coco Crazy just because I think the monkey pieces are more cute.

Not a bad little matching game. Great with the kids. I owned the MB Dragon Tales version that is virtually identical but it doesn't have the nice wooden chickens. Then again, I picked it up for about $6! This version also has the distinction of having the most original game name ever: Dragon Tales Matching Game!!! Whoever said the big US game companies have lost their imagination when you get a name like that! :-)

Jasmine at 4 is great at the game, for about 10 minutes, after which she loses interest. Next time play with multiple players (3 or more) or play with fewer eggs in the circle so that the race to catch up to the other chicken is quicker. Update - Fewer eggs worked for two player. She still dominated. Excellent short term memory workout, and the chase adds another layer of fun tension.

Seems like a solid children game. Better than normal memory games because the memorizing is a bit harder (you can't choose what piece you try to find and the quantity of pieces doesn't drop during the game). The winner is the player who memorizes the whole set fastets.

RATING: 9
I didn't have high hopes for this one and the first play with my 3 year old didn't make much of an impression. Something sparked it into life with her older sister joining in a later playing and a competitive rivalry growing. 

It quickly became the Christmas go to game. Surprisingly, it has a 3 and 7 year old on a level playing field with two parents. We also have Gulo Gulo and have seen people say kids do well in that but even with my sausage fingers I've been able to easily win when I please.

I honestly couldn't pick who'd win this game when we sit down to play. At a guess the 7 year old is slightly the most consistent followed by the 3 year old. Then marginally behind are the two parents.

The first family game that isn't all luck that we can all play at 100%. Great Game!

The game is capable of stalling but only if the players memories are poor.

Simple memory game with racing built on top. Nothing much really as an adult but my 4 years old cannot take enough of this. This is by far the most successful game that worked for her without any rule tweaks. She started to get it and the moment it clicked she jumped out and said "Oh! So I can flip another one if I move, right?" (I told you so just a minute ago...) Priceless.

How could anyone be afraid of a feather, you say? That's an honest question, and I'll try to give an honest answer.

First of all, did I say it was a poison feather?

April 2011: I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the pieces and the appealing artwork.  Overall it's a very solid game, and I think the kids will enjoy this a little more as they get a little older.  Perhaps this game will help the older one practice focusing a little more on a task.

The game has the obvious flaw in that it's possible that it might never end, as our first game encountered.   It's quite possible to go around and around for a very long time without a winner being crowned.   Initial rating a 7.

This game is an absolute delight. Played four times with my 8-year-old son today, and while I won the first three, he was always right in it, rattling off long stretches of movement. In the last game, I was right on his tailfeathers, but forgot where the Easter Bunny was and then the kid took off — went all the way around the track — and jumped me, landing on the same spot from which he began his turn. Just awesome.

An okay children's game that is pure memory. Your chicken moves around the outside circle of the board trying to match one of the face down tiles in the middle. The game starts slow, but after a few times around you are able to make some big moves if you can remember what other people have picked. My daughter has a great memory for this and won both games easily. Me on the other hand because it's pure memory I could care less about it. There are much better children's games out there in my opinion.

[thing=3570][/thing] introduces more of a competitive element than other memory games as you are trying to catch up to other people's chickens and steal their tail feathers. This is fun as it provides a light tension to the game that helps teach your child how to be competitive within the game without being vindictive. The next step above this, in terms of "take that", would be [thing=34819][/thing].

[b]Update[/b] Even when nearing 5, he still finds it difficult. Memorising a string of things really is taxing on the mind. As a matter of fact, daddy finds it tricky too, and it gets in the way of enjoying a nice game with the lil' one.

For the kids rating.  My 4-year-old is obsessed with it.  A memory game while chasing other chickens in a circle.  Lots of fun.

Sometimes we eliminate a few of the eggs around the edge to shorten the game play.  

I can only take one or two rounds before my memory head explodes.

Great game to play with children (6-12 years) because they can be really good and competitive at that, even against mature players, especially if they're over their 50s. Small suggestion if your children can't keep up: avoid looking at the face-up tiles before start and only let them do that. This will increase their memorization skills and prevent you from instant-winning the game.

The standard Memory kids' game, but with an added competitive element that makes for a fun time with younger kids. I'd definitely call this a kids' game, as opposed to a family game. As such, it's a good one.

At 5 years old, though, my daughter has gotten a little too good at memory games, and I'm not sure how long this will keep her interest. I wish we'd found it when she was younger.

This is a pure memory game --- an extremely good-looking memory game, but still just a memory game. Kids seem to love it. And, if you do not mind routinely being defeated by bratty future felons who are one-seventh of your age, then you'll like it well enough.

RATING: 7.5
This is simply the best kids' game I've played. What's great about you is that kids will trounce you in it, even if you try your very best, thanks to their incredible ability to concentrate and superior short-term memory. Beautiful components + quick plays = great family fun. If you buy only one kids game, this is the one to get.

Thrift store find ($1).

Impossible game to rate. My 4 year old daughter loves it, my 7 year old son thinks it is ok and my 10 year old son think it is totally pointless.

So I'm going with the average here. It really is a memory game for smaller kids, but much more fun than standard memory.

Simple game for children, spruced up by the amazing Zoch components.  Players move their chicken pieces around a loop of 24 tiles, each tile having one of 12 illustrations on it.  In order to advance you have to play Memory, locating the next illustration from amongst 12 face down tiles in the centre of the loop.  If you overtake an opponent, you get to steal their tail feather and add it to your own chicken.  Great game for the under five brigade, and the game is beautiful.  Doris is still one of the best game artists.

Very nice kids memory game.  The bits are great, the pictures are wonderful and the game simple and fast enough not to drag.  This has even been broken out with just the adults before (although I'm now banned from playing with them as my memory is better than theirs).

Oh, and I just got schooled at this by my 4 year old.  Seriously, the 4 year old!

Kid's Rating: High quality bits. The chits are thick, heavy cardstock with lovely artwork. The chickens are large, wood and nicely done. A memory game with 12 face down tiles in the middle and 24 tiles face up (2 for each one in the middle) randomly placed around in a track. Your chicken starts with a feather in the tail and if you jump over another chicken, you take their tail feathers. First player with all the feathers wins. My almost 4 year old still having a touch of trouble with this one - will pull it out again in a couple months.

The game looks good and as it's a memory game you'd think my 4.5-year-old would really like this one but for some reason doesn't really care for it.  Maybe it's the art style (she's particular about that kind of thing), or the fact that you take each others feathers (competition doesn't go well unless she wins).  She likes it more the more crazy chicken noises we make but for me this game was a surprising let down (perhaps my expectations were too high as it took some trouble to get a copy).

A classic that should rank highly on anyone's list of games for children. It's a glorified memory game, but with fantastic bits and much more fun. A great game for playing all-out as an adult and still getting your pants beaten off you by a 5-year-old.
Update: This was one of my first child's favorites when he was younger, but his younger brother was always more or less indifferent to it, so I finally sold it and its accompanying poop expansion. But I still think it's a classic if only for its production values. Remember, it was sooooo successful with my first child.

The real winner with kids and uncles and it's got a quick set up. Best game for 4 year olds who pick the game up quick. Games don't last too long and everyone has a chance to win - particularly when players get bunched up (and steal each others tails). Of all the kids games I have I would say this is number 1. Update:  Youngest (5) can now give her older brother (7) a run for his money. When we all play, it's nearly always the kids that win.

I rate children's games according to how excited I am to play with the appropriately aged child.

Memory games are so common for 4 year olds, and rightfully so, but it is a pleasure to play a memory game that just isn't turning over tiles or cards to make a match.

This is perfect for 4 year olds because there are only 12 tiles in the center kept face down in the same position to remember.  Each child has a chicken that cha cha's from egg to egg.  Each egg has a picture and in order to move they must turn over the matching tile in the center.  Next comes the inspiration and truly fun part of the game--each child's colorful and cute chicken is a whopping 3" tall and has a tail feather that can be inserted and removed in one of 4 holes in the chicken's rear.  When a child jumps over another chicken they get that chicken's tail feather which they stick in the back of their chicken.  The chicken who gathers all the tail feathers wins.

Fun, fun, fun.  What a refreshing memory game for this age group.

Let me explain the rating before you judge me too harshly.  I'm a dad.  I'm a gamer with kids who see their dad spending a lot of time around games.  Naturally, they want to play as often as possible so finding suitable choices for my two daughters can be difficult.  Enter Zoch.

We as a family have played lots of the other smaller games (Pick Picknick & Pickomino).  They are accessible and fun for all ages.  Chicken Cha Cha Cha goes that extra step in that it really makes it challenging for the parents to compete against the kids.  Try it and you will see what I mean.  A 6 year old's memory assimilates the hidden tiles so quickly, you hardly stand a chance against such a formidable opponent.  Had to that the quality of the components (does chickens are darn cute and plucking those feathers really makes us laugh), and you have a winner for everyone in the family.  This is not a family game which you can play uninvolved, unless you don't mind having your hat handed to you by a child.  Great great family game which should be part of any family's collection.

No setup montam-se os tiles de ovo, virados para cima, formando um circulo (caminho) e em seguida colocam-se os tiles hexagonais, virados para baixo, no centro. Cada jogador coloca sua galinha em um ponto do caminho circular e em seguida deve virar um tile hexagonal que tenha o mesmo desenho, do tile do ovo livre a sua esquerda, para poder avançar. Depois desvira e é a vez do outro jogador. Jogo de memória. Se tiver alguém na sua frente você pula a pessoa roubando o rabinho da galinha e coloca no rabinho da sua galinha. Estranho! Quem juntar três rabinhos vence o jogo. Péssimo e dependendo de quem está na mesa pornográfico.

This is a great memorization game for kids.  Since moving pieces involves memorizing tiles, you learn and your chicken gets faster as the game progresses.  This has two effects: one, the game converges more quickly to a solution as it progresses, and two, it introduces a neat play mechanic whereby your chicken gets better at something with practice, just like in real life.  On the other hand, I can't help but feel this is just a very simple memorization game dolled up with bells and whistles.  It got old quickly so I have mixed feelings.

When a kid grabs someone else's chicken's tail it's fun. Until you realise that the victim took the tail back (hint: it's not in the rules).

Purchased for daughter's 4th birthday. She likes it a lot but is distressed by the fact that mommy's memory is actually pretty good so she does NOT win all the time. Strongly suspect this would play better with 3 or 4 players and with just two the game is over as soon as one player overtakes the other (and takes too long if you start with 2 feathers each and can only steal one with each pass)

Rated in comparison to other children's games. Really nice simple memory game that's very easily made more or less difficult by removing or adding tiles. Easy to start your child off with just a few tiles and then increase the number as they improve. Part of the game is to jump over other players' pieces and take their fruit, which can lead to some sad faces, but it didn't take long to get past that. I have the Hedgehog version.

(Just kidding, though this is a game kids will most surely beat me in.)  Would it be ironic if I conveniently forget where I put this memory game so I avoid any further humiliation?  Hmm...  Had to increase score as this the most requested game that I have by my nieces and nephews.  I am expected to show up with it.  I still really suck though.

Rated as a kids game. Memory game with great components. I rated this a 7 for a while, just because memory is not my favorite mechanic, but the kids like it so much that I felt I had to up the rating. When my younger son was age 3-4, this was his favorite, I think mostly because he could beat the whole family at it.

RATING: 7
Rating reflects a child's perspective.  For an adult, depending on your memory level, this can be an embarassingly difficult game, depending on the age of the child.  I don't know how many times I have picked up the same mistaken tile multiple turns in a row.  This is basically a souped up game of memory with nice Zoch bits, but it offers just the right amount of challenge and lasts the perfect amount of time, gathering momentum as the game progresses.  Initially it seems difficult to get all the other tail feathers, but as you see the same tiles over and over your memory gets better and better.  A great idea, and a lot of fun to play with kids.

Tends to run long; I've played with other adults and the game has stretched on due to our being unable to recall the placement of the (visually similar) tiles. You could shorten the game by removing the duplicate stepping-path chits so that there were 12 on the table instead of 24, making the route to victory somewhat shorter.

Excellent production values.

Probably my favourite pure memory game. Pieces are practically indestructible, which is essential for the target age group. Have quite a lot of fun playing this with my 3.5 year-old, who loves performing some Cha-cha action with her preferred chicken. Her memory is good for about 4-5 tiles in a row, definitely enough to keep the game in balance. She absolutely must start on a rabbit egg.

Acquired maybe around 2003; whenever the English version was released. Played only twice in 2007. Total number of plays > 20. I can only play this game *once* in a single sitting. It's surprisingly fun for having only twelve "unknowns". The choice of artwork themes and colours is very, very clever and makes the game a little trickier than you might think from reading the rules. Works great with kids and certainly gives us older folks enough of a challenge (you have to concentrate).

memory game in race game. 
The four year olds had fun and continued asking to play this again. The three year old wanted to join but found it a little too tough.

I was afraid taking the feather of the other chicken would end in tears but it didn't.

Toughest thing was to show the picked tile to everyone. The rules they got easily enough.

Pronably good with a four year old. too light with 6year olds only.

Best Children's game that I have ever encountered.  My older daughter loves it.  This game has been played in my house more than any other.  The version we have is French and called Pique Plume.  UPDATE: It's been several years since I returned from a trip to Paris with this game and it's still a family favorite.  I've now become concerned about keeping all the pieces in order as I would like her to be able to share this game with her children some day as she has enjoyed so much. My son who was just born when I bought this now plays with me.

In this game, there are 24 tiles in a circle (2 of each symbol) and 12 in the middle face down (1 of each symbol). Each player is a chicken trying to lap the other chickens and take their tail feathers. It's a memory game where you need to reveal the symbol on the tile in front of you to keep going, and you stop once you're wrong.

Cute, quick, and fun, this was a nice quasi-filler that could be a great drinking game.

Bought Christmas 2007. Comments based on 1 play. Otto (4y9m) was upset to have her tail feathers taken away. Winner was Biggie (9y4m) who managed to get all the way around the board in one turn. I'm surprised that there aren't more issues with the taking away of those hard-earned tail feathers - it was a real problem when we played. Both kids are okay with earning things (some people have more, etc etc), but losing her hard-earned feathers was distressing for the little one.

Maybe I'm getting tired of memory games, but this one didn't really live up to the hype for me- the components are beautiful, but the game is pretty run-of-the mill.  I prefer Leapin' Lilypads and Sherlock to this, and you could buy them both for the price of this, and still have a lot of money left over.

UPDATE:  I've raised my rating on this from a 6 to a 7 because my four-year-old loves it.  I'm still a little indifferent to it, but she picks the games in our house and this is her current #1.

ANOTHER UPDATE:  This was a favorite for quite a while and really deserves an 8 from me.

My 7 year old's favorite game. We taught her to create a "memory palace" in the  style that Joshua Foer recommends in his book "Moonwalking with Einstein", and this game lends itself perfectly to practicing the technique. She can remember the location of every picture after just one trip around the board (seeing each image once). We have plenty of other memory games, but the humourous art and beautiful wooden chickens make Chicken Cha Cha Cha our favorite by far. :)

This is a great memory game with amazing bits! We have tried this with a 2-year old...still too advanced for him yet! I think it is a nice game for adults to play with kids though! The chickens have a path of eggs, each egg depicts a picture, if you uncover a hexagon tile that matches the egg, then your chicken can continue on the path. If the chicken passes another chicken and correctly makes a match, then you take a tail feather from the chicken! Once you have collected a feather of each color you win!

The winner will be the one who can memorise the 12 tiles fastest, and then reveal them in correct order. There's nothing more to it and no surprises along the way, except when people get something wrong they got right before. Theoretically it should be over immediately 11 tiles have been revealed, as a decent memory will mean you can now travel around the board without fault and win the game. But, it can be hard to care in a memory game sometimes.

Picked a bunch of games for the holidays but the most popular has been Chicken Cha Cha Cha - by far.  Kids love it and adults of all ages too.  The rules are extremely simple but our memory makes this game challenging.

The only game that a 6 year old can win without luck consistently.

Now that my son is older, we don't play as much.  Great game for what it is.

RATING: 7
Update: Most of my plays have been with my youngest 4 yo and I've enjoyed each and every play with him, not just because he has legitimately beaten me most of the time, but the insight as to what may be going on in both our heads and why his younger brain does better than mine: 

It is interesting that the only way I could improve my performance was applying mnemonic principles, much like with the Sherlock and Leo games. The latter two memory dependent games have a fixed circular or linear track to recall, whereas CCC has a scattered pattern to remember unless you keep them in a 4 x 3 pattern. With Leo and Sherlock I used number pegs, and of course making it easy takes away the challenge and onto the trade pile. I didn't think to apply number pegs to CCC, instead I tried to link or network the images by their adjacency. Not really effective, but it just got me wondering how do young brains recall so effectively without memory aids. The only elements I can think of is firstly stimuli is so refreshing to his brain, compared to my desensitised mind...I've seen it all before. 

Secondly, I strongly suspect his brain is constantly associating whereas my brain has been conditioned to filter/discriminate so that I think my son sees 12 connected tiles and I see them as individual tiles and sadly been deconditioned not to see them as a whole display. Obviously this is just a hunch but interesting to consider and wonder if that is where some of our potential lies. The other interesting thing was that when I did start to win, he would get extremely upset, at one point when I was getting closer that he didn't want to fail, and that just floored me about the content of his motivation, a game I will never forget.

A game I bought to play with my kids (perhaps obviously...) but what I'm most excited about is how it can comfortably be played by my older children together -- it's hard to find things a 6 year old and 3 year old can play that doesn't bore the older and frustrate the younger. But we can all play this one competently, as it's basically a memory game and little else. 

Even if the game starts slowly with lots of mistakes, it ramps up mighty fast--all of our plays have ended with someone running the table and stealing multiple feathers. Very long build-up and a very quick endgame. Another enjoyable memory game, which I never thought I'd say -- having kids has made me more appreciative of memory games.

We have the Dragon Tales themed version.
Nice enough memory game - of course kids have such a huge advantage over adults. I'm glad, too, since it would take forever if someone doesn't end up memorizing the whole board and lap everyone to finish the game.
I'm glad I didn't pay $30 for the Chicken CCC version - memory games simply are not worth that much IMO. And from the look of things, the Dragon Tales tiles are easier to distinguish from each other (easier to memorize).
Cant decide which I like better for memory games: Froggy Boogie or Chicken Cha Cha Cha.

Excellent use of a memory mechanic - and the pieces are great!  The wooden chickens alone make me want to play this game.  It's a little too advanced for my (currently) three year old, but I can see us playing this a lot fairly soon. Update: he just turned four and is starting to make some serious chicken advances, but just like his old man stalls right before the tail feather stealing jump!  His pulling the first three tiles he needed blind the other night was almost fun enough to raise this rating by itself.  I recommend this game!

Note:  I'm rating this game for kids.  For a memory game, not bad!  However, I realize that there are a number of good takes on the kid's memory game genre that I haven't tried yet.  Without that basis of comparison, all I can say is that it was fun to play with kids, to race and pay attention and goad, and the bits are very cute. The game was a challenge to me, having such a terrible memory.  Also, it was a little too long for the kids (5 and 8 yr old)--they got impatient, and it seems their memories weren't much better than mine.  However, this is correctible by just taking out a couple pieces from the board.

Interminable children's memory game, with amazing components. I'm sure children love it, but it drives this grownup insane. For a memory game that won't make you poke your eyes out I suggest Geistertreppe or Dawn Under.

Good memory game for young kids... and adults. Quite impressive when your three year old manages to pick up 18 correct tiles in a row - after a few rounds - for the win. (She taunted me too - "I'm going to get you.")

Got this plus the 'poop' expansion for my nephew. The components are excellent. Large colourful wooden pieces plus thick durable cardboard tiles. The chickens could probably serve as toys. They easily catch the attention of more reluctant gamers. And you'll invariable raise a smile after mentioning the poop. The box is at least two times larger than necessary. 

I'm continuously amazed at how poorly I do at this game. My nephew barely seems to be paying attention to the game (and he still hasn't cottoned to the idea of leaving the poop in one place - he trails it along behind his chicken like a little spooled wagon). Then, suddenly, he'll start flipping whole series of tiles like it was nothing. If necessary, you can reduce the difficulty of the game by lining up the centre tiles to form a grid. Sadly, even that doesn't seem to be enough help for me...

UPDATE: Bought a second copy for when he comes to my house.

Correcting my rating (making it higher). 
In the time since I've last played, I've began to appretiate kids games more, playing them with various kids more. This one is pretty good "for what it is", namely a simple memory game. You race around the circular track by the power of memory, and the more you remember, the faster you go. 
Not sure if it's challenging for me (while some memory games can be, hence not a higher rating), but kids did love it. It's accessible, simple and looks nice. Honestly it's better than many racing games out there.

[17 plays] Very high production quality enhances my opinion of this simple kid's memory game.

With young children, reduce the number of matching cards to make the memory aspect more manageable. It is very fun to watch their memory skills increase over time with this and other games.

Most recent play 12-3-10 with Ruth, Etta, and Orrin.

RATING: 6
Overproduced kid's memory game with a twist. Players start with chunky wooden chickens (which look great!) and have to flip over a tile matching the egg space in front of them. If they are successful, they get to move forward. When they come to an opponent, they must match the egg tile in front of the opponent. Doing so gives them the tail feather of that opponent.

Wonderfully thick tiles and cute little chickens will delight kids. The gameplay is above average but it's overpriced for what it is.

In contrast to many other BGG players' reports, Chicken Cha Cha has not been a hit with my 4-yo. He totally gets the rules, but has trouble keeping attention for as long as the game tends to take to play. Also gets terribly upset when somebody steals his tail feathers, so much so that so far we have succeeded in only a couple of completed plays, and after them we were fed up and a bit stressed out, and had to go outside and ride bikes for a while ...

Ridiculously big empty box, equal to Gulo Gulo.

My points are for the nice Chickeeples & tiles.

EDIT: Kid is now almost 6, and we still don't enjoy this. I regret spending money & making a smaller box & coming up for a Norwegian name for it. Even though my kid wants to try this every once in a while, I still beat him easily (and I refuse to play stupid) & he still just wants to put tail feathers in his chicken.

Cute racing game that is fueled by memory to keep your Chicken moving.  It can play quick, but with good players it can go indefinitely. For adults there is not a lot of there there, but for kids this is great.  The memory element gives them an advantage over adults and it levels the field for them.  That said, I FAR prefer Der Plumpsack as it offers not only memory but spacial relation.

This game has perhaps the coolest pieces around.

This game shows me how stupid I am. The best part is seeing my Oxford Grad (Masters in Biochem) blow a fuse and throw his chicken about. Half a point for that. I don't score it so high because while the game is fine with the pictures similar enough to thwart your memory... it just causes a headache so that I'd rather play something less grating.

Remarkably good and fun for a simple memory-style, matching game. Over time, you begin to learn where everything is, yet the tension builds as you can taste victory by getting the sequence right but also know that one false decision will cost you the game. What this has over a memory game like Repeat Pete is that the learning builds throughout the game to culminate in a nice climax, rather than learning an entirely new sequence each time someone make a mistake.

Every game ends in a humiliating defeat for me.  My 8 year old has an awesome memory for the various tiles and even though I keep trying to develop a system, I quickly lose track of what's where.  Maybe my dear daughter's secret weapon is table talk

We've played this ALOT. We created our own Duckling Dancing "poo", which makes the base game even more fun and challenging. I win half the time, but the difficulty can be adapted by moving your opponents chicken closer to you, or limiting the amount of correct eggs you can move forward in a turn.

Beats Gulo Gulo as the all-time champion most requested game by my children, especially my youngest.
My four and seven year-olds both loved it right after we started.  The twist is that you can see what others did right before you and catch up quickly, which works well for a children's game.  Since it is indeed a children's game, my rating reflects that genre.

Brilliant game for small children at MANY levels.  We bought this for our daughter when she was 1 yo, and she has been playing with it ever since.  Initially just as toys, of course.  Then as a dexterity challenge of putting the feather in and out of the chickens, and finally at 3, beginning to play the game .This game is NOT overproduced--it is produced for young kids and can stand up to their play.  Now our daughter didn't bite or chew on the pieces, but she did treat them in every other way as a 1 yo is wont to do, and the game is still in GREAT condition 2 years later.  In those terms this was an incredibly fair price for a long lasting and changing toy.

[RGG 2003 Edition] {Chicken, kid; memory; optimal 3-4p} A good memory game for children (5-9). It's only a children game. It's easy to explain and learn and children have no problem in understanding the rule. The chickens are cute and children really like them; esp. when they pick the feather of other chicken.

I have bought one as a gift for my colleague. He and his daughter like the game very much. His daughter even teaches her friends to play it. Well, she cries when the tail of her children is picked.

[Expansion] Its expansion seems funny; however, the addition of ducks and dropping seems not directly related to chickens. I would skip it.

I can't explain it, but this game is great.  The only strike against it is that kids can get a little frustrated if they can't find that one tile, and they get stuck.  But everything else about this game is top-notch.  One of the best kids games that I have ever played.

You know, every so often, you come across a sublime gaming moment--one that you will never forget.  I experienced one of those with this game.  My 6 year old daughter was about to overtake me for the win when I went on a sudden memory streak wherein I tore all the way around the circle and overtook her for the win.  I threw my arms in the air and cheered like I had just won the World Series.  

For an adult to win this game is almost unheard of.  Once in a lifetime.

RATING: 7
the ideal type of kids game (like Gulo Gulo) where the young kids have as good (or at least almost) a chance to win as adults, as they seem to get the memory game so much quicker. honestly, straight up "Memory" type games drive me crazy, but this one seems much more fun. Something about the twist of the randomly placed "eggs" around the edge gives the memory aspect one more variable to add some challenge.

so far this hasn't interested my 3 year old, which was my intended target. 6 year old plays it great.

seems to have an issue with a player falling behind...hard to catch up. in this way, Gulo Gulo is a bit more clever.

UPDATE: my 3 year old is now nine, and this has been her favorite game for at least 4 years in a row. and she's quite good at it. Also, the catch up thing isn't a problem...if someone is paying attention, they can really rocket ahead when they get in the right groove. Also, multiple plays in a row will REALLY benefit the kids as adult heads start to hurt.

RATING: 6
Embarrassing but true:  I bought this thinking it would be nice to have something the younger kids could play while the big kids [their parents] were playing grown up games in the other room with me.  Inexplicably ended up playing this with big kids and enjoyed it [also kicked butt]  Kids have never played it. The lure of the Wii is too strong.

A "racing" game where the pieces are fueled by a memory game. Good for children, and maybe better than the old "Memory".

Very fun game to play with kids.  They usually win and love that.  Nice pieces make the game a little funner. Probably a 8 for kids game.  Not so much for adult only game.

Fantastic fun memory game to play with small children. I started with this one when my boy was still two, now he is three if I can keep him focused long enough he will to beat me!

Great fun for up to four players. With only two I tend to remove a couple of the symbols.

He loves it and asks to play it so it gets an 8, personally I'd give it a 4, maybe less, but that's only as I'm so crap at it! But seriously, is a great game to play with young children.

A fine children's game, and a fun game for adults to play with children.  Undeniably great components.  If the 12 tiles are muddled a bit (that is, not put into a nice 4x3 grid), it's even better.

This is the near-perfect children's game. Beautiful components, very simple rules, short playtime, and fun for adults, too! 
(I've actually played this one a couple of times with no children in sight...)
Oh, and I can never beat my girls at this. Even the youngest one (3 years old) beats the crap out of me.

Don't be surprise if adults shy away from this memory game. The rules say for 4 and above. I would say 4 to ...perhaps 30?

Fantastic game to play with children even as young as 4. The one with the best ability to memorize will probably win each time, so it might need some luck element added, but the tension that builds as each player learns the location of each tile builds so well. This is the best memory-style game I've played. (Rated as a game played with children - I have a lot of fun playing it but I wouldn't bring it out with only adults).  Note: Memory games are problematic for me; I avoid them always, similar to deduction. Most other game mechanics are more level in ability (e.g. someone can't really be better than someone else at set collection). Memory and Deduction are two that seem to create the same result every time - either someone is able to deduce or not, either someone can remember or not. I have not lost a game of Zicke Zacke because I can remember the location of things really quickly. If I could find someone who could do the same I would enjoy the competition. As it is I enjoy playing with kids and adjusting my "memory" to fit them. In theory a kid can beat an adult at memory games, which makes them really good kids games - I need to find that kid! (Hoping my own kids are good or that I can develop their memories through playing games like this ;)

Good for a memory game (not a genre I'm a big fan of). I just gave this to my daughter, and she loves it. She has been improving at it frighteningly quickly.

Rating assumes for playing against my daughter. Against an adult it would be a few ranks lower.

I increased the rating to 8 now that my grandson is 5. The game goes much more quickly and is much more fun. Most importantly he likes it much more, an in turn we adults like it better. Some unexpected turns in players' fortunes adds to the enjoyment.

Just got this for my 4 year-old grandson. We have tried it about 4 times and each time he got bored with it. I was kind of bored too. Will try again when he is older.

Just played with my wife and 15 year-old. Enjoyable, although our daughter wiped us off the map. Raised my rating from 5 to 7. Memory games are not my cup of tea, but this was a fun one.

Nice change from the average memory game. Too bad I don't like memory games! Kids like it, the bits are extremely well produced, and you can use the funky chickens as solid toys.

Fun game with kids. A memory game with a twist, and kids usually have a easier time for memory games than adults. This is a  good game for young children and something they can even play by themselves, without adults. It is even better with the Ducklin' Dancing expansion though, and I highly recommend that you get them both.

You are all playing chickens, roosters (and in the expansion ducks) dancing the Chicken Cha Cha Cha around a track of very colorful egg-shaped tiles with great pictures on them. Each picture is repeated twice, with 24 tiles total. There are 12 octagon-shaped tiles face down, encircled by the egg-shaped tiles. Each turn you must flip one of the octagon tiles over, and in order to move your fowl to the next egg tile, you must find the matching picture. If you succeed you get to go again, and if you pass another bird you steal one of their tail-feathers. The first bird with four tail-feathers wins. This works out so well in practice, and the tension really rises towards the conclusion of the game.

So why does the expansion improve things? By adding bird poop to the game of course. :)

This is a lot more entertaining than you'd think.  It's just a memory matching game… but you have to match specific things, at the right moment.  In the meantime, other players take their turns, and you may see what you need, but you'll see a lot more of what you don't, and as you get more amused, you mess up more easily.

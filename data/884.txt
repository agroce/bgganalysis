This is a very good cross between a Euro and a American game. It's got nice graphics but with some shooting and cattle rustling. The worst thing about the game is the scoring system and the lack of a good score sheet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
With 3 players this is a little on the dull side, but with more it comes alive - more bidding interest and more battles.

The game wasn't quite as fun as I'd imagined it to be - but was deeper. In one respect, it's a bit between stools.  It's not as light as I thought it would be.  So, it's not a barrel of laughs like, for instance, Pirate's Cove - which has a similarly strong theme, but involves the players in more interaction and has a lighter feel.  On the other hand, there is a LOT more strategy in it than PC - though much less Tactics. 
  
We use the Wounded Cowboy variant - where a cowboy is only killed on the roll of a 6.  A 5 merely wounds him and forces him to retreat to another town.  We also allow the Railroad to be bought with $15 instead of $20, so it comes into play more.  In a bank-raid, we have the owning player only paying up for the first die roll, and the other two come from the reserve.  We haven't used the Morgue variant yet, but I think that we will - may be at $3 to buy.  If a cowboy is killed the owning player gets $2. Morgue owners could become rather vulture like, I guess!

The bottom line is, though that the game isn't as much fun as some Euros and isn't as deep as others...hmm, not bad, but not great either.  Worth a 7.5 for play with 4/5 players, only a 5 with 3.

RATING: 5.5
{1 play • 5 player} Frustrating and kind of unforgiving.  On the one hand, there's all this fairly cool economic planning... and then that all goes out the window when you roll dice.  And you must roll dice - there's doesn't seem to be a viable non-gunfight strategy.  Still, now that I know that, perhaps my next game will be more enjoyable.  I was "taken out" fairly early - another frustrating thing: it's often easier to hit the guy in last, and just as lucrative, sometimes moreso - so I went for broke on dominating the final town... and won (thus the ".5")... but only because other players were in a kingmaking position, and chose not to hit me (when they probably should have).  And even that was possible *only* because I placed there round one, on a whim.  Another player got zapped mid-game, and had no way to recover (I think his final score was less than 10).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Finally played. Not too sure about it. The theme works and the towns slowly build up into "bustling cities" full of gun totting cowboys. The rules are a little confusing (a few typos) but in depth. There are a lot of little exceptions here and there.
The end bogs down to number crunching which is usually a turn off for me in a game.
However I'll give this another go.
I just don't think Wallace games are for me.

I didn't give it another go. Traded.

RATING: 6
it's amazing what a boring set of board and bits can do to bring out a theme!  somehow it just happens with this one.  bank and railroad need help, and a lot of the game doesn't feel tested.  still a lot to like, including the action selection.  first example of worker placement type mechanics i encountered, way before caylus and company.  i have a player aid in the files section.

RATING: 7
I think this is a good game, but not based on the first playing.  There were lots of mistakes in play (not rules) made by players and horrid die rolls placed some players out of the running.  If players are famaliar with the available options and actions, the game does a nice job of presenting much of the old west feel.  I do not think this is Wallace's strongest showing, but it is still a solid game.  Be prepared for a game that takes a slight bit longer than expected.  Also be open to playing it a couple of times to see how the options combine.  The learning curve won't be so bad that your early plays will be unenjoyable - its just a game that will likely get better with more plays.

This Wallace game has the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. The Good is it's theme. Not to many Western themed "German style" point games. The box art is good also. The Bad is some of it's mechanics. You can tell it wasn't tested well enough. The Ugly is it's chaotic gun fights and poor investment of the Bank. A player can be wiped out of the game if the others gang up. The wounded cowboy varient works well and improves the game immensely. All in all I enjoy playing this one. "If it's not Wallace it's Crap!"

There's a very strong western theme to be enjoyed here. This another game with plenty of options and relatively little time to carry them out, so you have to use your brain. The transition from setups that accumulate cash in early scoring rounds to the final layout for VP scoring has to be mastered or you're done for.

The bidding for turn order is interesting as there are definitely times when going first is important and other times when it is better to go last. 

And yes, the bank is definitely broken. No-one in the game I played bought one, despite lots of effort spent by all of us in suggesting that someone else bought one :)

Probably one of the more fun 5-6's I have played.  The theme is great.  The buildings and cattle and stuff are all cool.  You can rob the bank, rustle cattle, have a dirty sherrif, etc.  Yet, it seems a little too fiddly and the rules weren't so intuitive at first.  I really have heartburn about the ability to have 4 cowboys attack 5, shoot first, kill a couple of them, and totally have the upper hand.  Does the train ever get used?  It seems like a useless piece (costs far too much for the payoff).  And the bank is like owning a timebomb in many instances.  So great theme but not quite polished.

Cool game, but it seems to be one with a pretty hard ceiling at around 5 games. I rather enjoyed those first 5 games, but after that it just seemed to become apparent that the economic game took a backseat to the shoot-out game, and the shoot-out game isn't all that interesting. Still recommended, but not a great game (some games seem to play out, but are still replayable ocasionally over a long period of time - La Citta is a good example for me. With Way Out West, I think I'm just done). Oh, and it has a fairly bad kingmaker problem on the last turn.

My first playing ran long - but I think we played an extra turn than what was written in the rules.  I liked it, but I'm not necessarily itching to get it out again.  But I wouldn't object if enough others decided it was a good one to play.  We played with some of the variants right off the bat, and they did seem to make it better.

1 play (3p). Liked it. Liked the simple progression of play with tough choices and conflict. Some fuzzy edges to the rules causing angst; used the fan revised rules with FAQ posted here. There are two main gears to the mini-maxy euromachine, dollars and VPs, with "american" aggression and dice to add excitement and uncertainty. I thought the mechanics worked well with the theme, mostly. Had the familiar Wallace feel, competing for majorities for VPs. VPs are tricky; I had no idea how the final VP would end up. Would like to try it with 4p and 5p. A keeper.

I'm a big fan of many Martin Wallace designs.  This is one that I'd wanted to play for a long time, but had heard it had some flaws.

The theme is great and I think it holds up well during the game play. There really ought to be more good Western/cowboy games. Surprised that theme hasn't been put to better use.

Two main quibbles:
1) The endgame scoring is both a bit anticlimactic and feels disjointed from the rest of the thematic play. Maybe with more experience everyone would just intuitively know the scoring system, but until then it seems a little separated from all the other things you're doing.

2) Its true the gunfights allow for some luck to change your fate. You can get screwed or get lucky. Actions are so scarce all game long, that taking a gunfight action only to LOSE is doubly painful.  I know there are some recommended house rules to try and mitigate the luck here, but I prefer to play with the game as designed. I think the luck is actually just part of the theme. But you'll need to accept that before the game starts or be frustrated.

The game could play very quickly with experienced players.

Really like the turn-order auction.

I'd be willing to play this one any time, but its not among Wallace's upper tier.

RATING: 5
I expected quite a bit from this title, and it let me down in ways I wouldn't have anticipated.

First, let me say: the combat system doesn't really need tweaking. As much as people talk about it here, the system seemed to work fine, and there were still plenty of gunfights.

The issue with this is the buildings though, and it's a pretty big one. The scoring system for the game is dependent on all 6 buildings being viable purchases. If they're not, then the later towns that have more slots for buildings are not much better than the lower towns, which screws up the game. The problem is that two buildings are basically useless. One, the railroad, is just too expensive to ever be placed, the second, the bank, is so ridiculously dangerous to own that the only real way to use it is to place it at the very end of the game and to pray that no one robs it in the interim.

I like a lot of the ideas that this one has. The action tightness is superb for instance, and the cattle concept seems to work well; but I would term this an unfinished concept. If there had been more playtesting and balancing the game could have been very good, as it stands it would require some extensive house rules to fix up, and I'm just not willing to put the time in.

Should be great, but just comes out very good.  The theme is a million bucks, the gameplay and scoring are a little creaky and the rules are mysterious but so what, it's the rootinest', tootinest cowboy board game around.  I really like the action menu and the way the buildings pay out but the combat is a little dodgy and I'm not so sure about the need for an auction. Nonetheless, it's a fun game for at least 4 players.  Warfrog production...keeeeeerap, as usual!

One play.  When I played this I made serious errors at the begining and was quickly whiped off the board.  I was ready to walk away and give this a 4.  I made a nice comeback, however and finished in a strong second.  That's good ... the only thing worse than player elimation is defacto player elimination that requires the player to keep playing.  This game does promote a "beat on the weak guy" philosophy which I'm not sure I liked.

Seriously buggy. I cannot believe anyone actually played with the bank rules as written before the game was published and actually thought that it was balanced. But that's not the only problem. A more general problem is that you have to remember a lot of details for how payouts and scoring works. The details should come from the bits, or at worst reference cards. I actually don't mind the randomness of gunfights, as I feel they should be random. I think there's a decent game in there somewhere, but the bank must be fixed before we can have any hope of finding it.

Used copy. Purchased through BGG Marketplace. Typical Martin Wallace. Very thematic, but needs a fix for the poorly designed bank. We play that the bank itself draws money from the buildings built into the town, with the bank owner skimming 20% off the top. That way, when a bank gets robbed, most of the "take" comes out of the bank's holdings, not the owning player's money. Otherwise, everything else represents a great game where the theme sticks.

Imagine a typically Wallacian set-up where with a multi-layered victory point system based on majorities where the presence of other players is a major driving force to your income. The board is set-up such that the game is pushed towards conflict between the roving bands of gunslingers under each player's control. As the game continue, the board fills up and conflict becomes inevitable. Unfortunately, two of the buildings are complete red herrings in a way that is not obvious until the game progresses and the combat system (you hit 1/3 of the time and there are tons of strange, unclear modifiers and the lower total strength shoots first) is such that combat is a pure crapshoot, leading to a degenerate pointless end game.

I'm not sure what to think of this game.  It seems to be more advantageous to use cowboys to take over buildings/cattle, rather than spending money to build them yourself, so the game can devolve into a series of dice-rolling gun battles.  Attacking is further reinforced by the bonus for wanted posters.  It would be nice if the game offered a better balance between lawlessness and "civilized" progress.  Having said that, the game can be fun to play, and the relatively short length is appropriately suited to the game's level of depth.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game is an old design and there certainly are better titles today (Carson City), but it has a certain charm. You draft actions and place your pieces on the board to maximize their income (and endgame VP) production. You use your money (VPs) to both bid for turn order and to buy more pieces and the cowboys to protect 'em. 

But soon there's no room for what you want to do and the only alternative is to fight another player by rolling dice. The clever idea here is that whoever has fewer cowboys rolls first and has the chance to take some of the opponent's cowboys out before they even roll.  

I got into an ill-advised battle early on in the game and rolled crazy good and won. I took over another player's building. He felt as if the game were over for him due to the setback but he actually finished ahead of me, so I'm happy to see players can survive at least some setbacks in the game.

Not one to be taken too seriously but fun with a group who's in the right mood for something lighter yet still with interesting decisions. My one play was at a public game club and it worked perfectly for that environment.

Played this again (3 player) after a long break last night and I was reminded of why, whilst liking much of it and the theme I haven't rushed out and bought one.  Aside from the question of why would you ever build a bank, the game desperately needs a player aid as to what the different buildings/people do (in terms of income and scoring), and this together with the difficulty of appraising the scoring position and relative strengths (there are some people who would recount the scoring position before a turn) means that I'm not about to rush out and buy one.

More of a cowboy sim than a full sort of game, we struggled to play this properly. A poorly written set of rules, including serious typos (the word 'no' is missing from one rule), and our mistakes made this seem a weak game. But, by the end, we finally had a handle on it, and I would be willing to try this again. If we'd understood it properly, it would have been a much more cut-throat game. The basic game itself is good, but it needs redesigning. A better board lay-out, player-aids, much better rules, and this would be a top game.

WAY too much luck in this game.  For a much cheaper alternative just roll dice and see who can roll higher for an hour.  Buildings (which costs lots of money) can switch in a couple of rolls and give the winner a big advantage while the loser scrambles to salvage anything they have in that town.  This game has a huge steamroller effect.

Two plays, one with five and one with four. Our first game was very chaotic, but in the second the veterans had grasped the importance of/were more skilled at achieving détentes and so the game felt a little more strategic. Regardless, there is still a huge luck factor; yes, you need to maneuver yourself into contention through smart play, but among those front-runners the game is going to be decided by the shootouts on the final turn. If you can deal with that and you don't mind the slightly heavy rule set, the game will be enjoyable; if not, you'll probably want to stay away. Incidentally, I think I would rather play with four than five just because the game will be shorter and will require less mental effort; why should I knock my brains out when it's going to come down to a dice-off anyway?

This is not a game to fall in love on first sight. But still it's somehow a keeper, as there are not so many games with western theme that have enough player interaction. If you like other M. Wallace design you should try this as well. If you dislike his designs then this will be no exception. When playing I often felt "with a house rule we could make it better".

I'm no fan of the theme, but it's well implemented, despite some quite unintuitive rules. It's reasonable that a game with such theme has combats, but a few bad die rolls may severely harm your strategy. One production flaw: some buildings look too similar and their tokens should be larger.

Two games that likely make my "Best" lists are by Martin Wallace. This game isn't one of them.

Two Wallace games definitely make my "Worst" list, however. And Way Out West is high on that list.

It does a lot of what other Wallace games do. It's abstract and fiddly (Wallace hallmarks). It champions limited actions, worker placement, economic/resource austerity, and severe punishments for any inefficiency.

But the times that Wallace really drives me screaming from the table - as he did with Way Out West - is the fact that he builds all of these popular mechanics onto straight up dice rolling that isn't any more sophisticated than Risk, but much fiddlier.

Ameritrash is often marked by direct conflict, player elimination, kingmaking, chaos, and wild swings due to chaos/luck. 

Euro designers have tried "build a better mousetrap" in a manner of speaking - finding ways to lessen these pitfalls and still make a game with that Ameritrash sensibility or flavor, but with some Euro influences. Croc is one designer that comes to mind with Age of Gods and Claustrophobia. Feld is another with Bora Bora.

Wallace's attempts at Ameritrash - with WAY OUT WEST and MOONGHA INVADERS (not surprisingly, the other Wallace title on my "Worst" list) - always boil down to dice rolling which impacts severely the outcome. To the point where you're watching everyone else play - another characteristic of bad Ameritrash experiences. 

And this isn't a type of game where you shrug off the chaos and luck (or bad luck) because 1) it doesn't play that fast, and 2) there's all the other dense and tense mechanics in the game to manage. Lose some gunfights early and you fall behind and your choices become limited or only serve to feed the other players. 

At one point in the game one of the player's only possible move to try to make any gains was to place two cowboys in a city to try to stave off cattle elimination in that city. Each action she paid two dollars to the opponent who was stealing her cattle for the privilege of placing two cowboys that were then quickly dispatched by that same opponent's stockpile of 6-7 cowboys.  

This game is an earlier design of Wallace's. And to me it really shows in the fledgling game experience. It's not elegant. It feels like a thought experiment he cooked up where he wanted to play with certain mechanics and not worry about how they stitched together. And I think he still has this obsession with reinventing Ameritrash, but with poor predictable results.  

WAY OUT WEST makes Risk look like chess, and that's not a good thing at all.

RATING: 7
Great fun and most everything involved in the theme is suffed in here somehow. The rules are simple but perhaps a bit "fiddly," as they say. Buildings have different effects when you successfully attack them, different things happen when you do this as opposed to that, etc. Gets a little frustrating for a light and well-themed game like this. Still good, though.

Quite enjoyable.  At first I thought... &quot;eh, another tile placement game&quot;... but it&#039;s more than that in spades.  The theme plays into the design nicely, and the mechanics are very nicely balanced.  I&#039;ve played it four times and there were no obvious runaways during our games.  Not the most *serious* game on the West out there, but might be one of the more fun ones.

After another trip through wild west territories in America, my child hood awoke. The Loan Ranger, trailblazing, cattle drives, a man and his horse, self made destiny, sunrises, storms clouds boiling over the lips of the mountains under a bruised purple sky, bandits, desperadoes, native Americans, huge sprawling vistas under the wide blue sky, bird calls, campfires, gambling, the stage coach small against golden hills and green waves of prairie, scrub brush, dust, rain, and lightning strokes pounding the ground at the horizon line, mist in the vales, ground boiling, sulfur clouds, pine forests, geysers throwing up billowing white silk sheets silent in their glory, acid pools, and a man's wits.

This game is my remembrance of all that, all my dreams of slinging six shooters and being the lone hero riding slowly into some small town in need. It's a way to recall Wyoming, Deadwood, Montana, South Dakota, and Jesse James days in Northfield Minnesota.

This and Samurai, and Shogun (the GameMasters series) are my souvenir games to bring my mind to loved places I've visited. For that alone, I'm glad to have it in my collection.

RATING: 7
Initially complex and rules a little fiddly with several queries from players, but this does allow game to fit in with theme.  Can get quite viscous and luck does play a large part if players get involved in lots of shoot-outs.  Keep a low profile and let others do most of the shooting.

Nasty game when the end reaches near.  At first you do not suspect the brutality, but as the game progresses, the players tend to step on each other's toes, and gunfights are really violent!  Very good game indeed, with simple, easy-to-learn rules!

RATING: 5
An early Wallace that displays an early version of his challenging decision points that were put to better use in better games. This one is brought down by having buildings that are not worth their cost and overly complicated income and scoring relationships. Difficult decisions, yes, that can be ruined by lucky or unlucky dice rolls. Can be fun or can be frustrating depending on what you like. This falls into the frustrating camp for me. Much better western-themed games these days.

The theme really clicks with the gameplay. Some in my group didn't like the dice rolling combat, felt that it became too luck dependent, but I did not mind. I feel it helps minimize analysis and leads to a quicker game. I think an interesting variant is to add a new building, The Morgue. For every cowboy killed in town the owner of the morgue gets cash.

RATING: 5
Clearly a Wallace design from the Warfrog time before he converted it to Treefrog. Firmly in the Weuro niche which usually doesn't do it for me. Too much conflict and kingmaking potential to enjoy the planning, not enough theme and too abstract to enjoy the conflict. Also features the typical quirky Wallace design decisions. This time, two of the buildings (rail, bank) are ridiculously overpriced. And there even is the action of robbing the bank that will never happen as nobody is going to take the bank.

RATING: 6
2nd play: I'm starting to see the game inside this. The interplay of buildings and cattle and cowboys drives the income and final scoring. It's not immediately obvious and you should give the game a few tries before passing judgement. 

*******************************
I'm a huge fan of Wallace's games, so I was surprised at how lukewarm I was after playing this. It has Wallace's trademark limited actions and money mechanics. However, the only things you can't afford to buy are things that you don't necessarily want anyway (train, bank.) The limited actions make it seem like a huge burden to act aggressively - build cowboys, move cowboys, gunfight - that's 3 of your 18 actions in the game. Why not just build cowboys and let the others come after you? The theme is pretty strong so that helps, but it just didn't seem like much happened in the course of the game. I do look forward to trying it again and seeing if my opinion changes.

The Good: Something that is tough to find: A good game with a Western theme. This game is an economic builder with area control. Money is tight in this game which adds to the challenge. Lots of tough decisions every turn, with so many things you want to do.  

The Bad: The components are just functional - board is a little drab and cardboard chits are used. There is conflict, and it involves rolling dice. However, this part did not bother me, as a majority almost always wins, and so if you want to avoid fights, keep a majority there. Unfortunately, the Bank and the Train are not that useful, so are rarely seen.

Added a whole point to my experience playing it.
we played it three players and I think there was one city too much in play. Could have been tighter.
There were not enough cowboys and cattle available.

Cowboys I kind of understand but in the end I could leave my cattle behind in a city without cowboys since my opponent had no cattle anymore of his own to make it his.

I also lost pretty badly after losing a fight early on (round 2 or 3 in the 3 city with 4 cowboys and a jail against 2 cowboys. Lost me three cattle and left me short on cash the entire game. 


In the end I had to pick a winner and again faith determined it was against Micheal. His store was unprotected by other cowboys. So it  the biggest benefit for me and easiest to pull off.

I had hoped Micheal and James would have picked a fight earlier and I could profit from it but they didn't.

If you don't care for dice, stay far away.  A fair bit of chaos/luck in the gunfighting system which is fun and suspenseful at times but feels like it needs a bit of modification - not sure what though.  Bonus points awarded to most successful gunfighter, most money earned, and then points awarded for cattle and buildings as well as majorities in each of the five towns.  Banks seem fairly pointless and potentially dangerous as you can lose all your money if they are raided!

I much prefer Carson City for the Western theme at this point...

The game play:

Some old school majorities and synergy. You can see this is an obvious early "Martin Wallace does something not involving trains". It has potential, and I think if he ever revised it and smoothed out the rough edges (bad comparison but think Brass to Age of Industry) that it would be possible to make a game I'd want to play here.

The Combat:

This game requires and encourages combat. Combat is simply roll offs of D6's. The results of this are equal parts encouraging and distressing.

I wouldn't seek it out. Perhaps it needs another play but with so much good Wallace out there I'm not sure that I would want to.

RATING: 7.5
OK, so there are some potential flaws in this game (bank, train, the gunfights), and one undeniably confirmed flaw (the poor writing of the rulebook).  But no game this "broken" has produced so much fun for me thus far.  

After two plays, I like it a lot more than I thought I would when I first opened the box.  It's fun.  Ooozes theme, despite the fact that it's cardboard counters on a plain looking board.

Try it as written if you can.  We didn't find such glaring holes it in as everyone else did.

Found that for experienced players, it can play very quickly.

Wallace has better games. 
While the cowboy theme is cool, it is so tacked on that it means nothing. The game could be called wacked out ho' and work just the same. Replace the cows with hookers, cowboys with pimps, hotels with crack houses... you get the idea.
Bigger problems than tacked on theme include:
 
The combat in this is really wacky. Why would the guy with fewer cowboys have the advantage? The wounded cowboy house rule doesn't really solve the problem. (I think simultaneous combat might) but it still seems wacky. Also the whole built in defender/sheriff thing gets strange.

Banks, why would you build these they can bankrupt you pretty quickly with the rules as written. 

As typical if you do not understand the end game scoring from the start you will lose this game in the early rounds with out knowing it.

This one was a pleasant surprise as I went in thinking I wouldn't like it much.  The components are sub-par though.  Chits could have been made slightly larger.  Text on what each building does could have been added to chits or to game board for easy reference.  Rules were poorly produced (no graphics and very small type). I would think that this game would be ripe for a reprint as the gameplay is solid. I felt the scoring was too complicated and could be simplified.  Since there is no scoring track for victory points or other way to track them - why not have everything converted back to money?  The Railroad and Bank are too expensive and not worth buying.  A few tweaks to the rules and a prettier reprint would make this game very solid (Top 200 worthy). In its current state its about a 6 for me.

06/25/06 I played a three player game, once (1.5 hours). San Antonia?!? I'm from Texas, and misspelling San Antonio irked me. Otherwise its a nice game. I'm not sure why anyone would build a bank (unless you were playing last on the final turn). Its expensive to construct and looks like nothing but a magnet for robbers. The other items you could purchase seemed to have value, use, or both. 
07/07/12 Played a four-player game in 1.75 hours. I guess my standards have gone up in the last six years, For today I found the graphics in this game poor. The Store, Hotel, and Bank look almost exactly alike, especially upside down, across the table. Even the train and stagecoach look too similar from a distance. Plus the whole board looks dreary. In a word the graphics look Primitive. Therefore I'm lowering my rating from "7" to "6". (Especially after they reprinted the game in the last few years and still didn't fix San Antonia!)

Lots of great elements in this game.  Great combination of economics, risky combat, and area control.  Definitely plays okay the way that it is, it's not "broken" but there are some odd elements (i.e. high price of the train).    Banks and Trains are certainly risky - this is just one of those matters that everyone will have their own take on.  The only thing that seemed to needlessly clutter the game is the bid for turn order (although I have not played 5 player).  It certainly hasn't been tweaked enough in the area of number of players/adjustments.  For example, why would you need all five cities with 3 players?  Just not logical.  I enjoyed this one, not so sure my game group did.

A nice, lighter, kinda goofy Martin Wallace that I was lucky enough to pick up cheap on Tanga.  I like it.

It's a bit of a worker placement game, I guess, with some area control, which isn't my favorite, but it's not too overbearing to the rest of the game.  Typical of a number of Wallace games, you basically have two actions per turn.  Here, though, you don't get the actions back to back, like Brass, or A Few Acres of Snow.  There aren't unlimited things for you to do over the game so you have to make your choices count.  If you don't get what you want, well you can always send in some cowboys to try to take it from somebody else.  This brings what I think is the best aspect of the game. It can't be too thinky because it comes down to the luck of the dice.  That doesn't mean your choices aren't meaningful but don't overthink it because you can't totally plan for how those dice will roll.  

We were all pleasantly surprised in our 4 player game.  The one real downside is the art is pretty plain.  Nothing about the look of the game excites you much, and that's too bad because they could have really played up the theme more.  I mean, this is the Wild West.  But at least the game FEELS like the Wild West.  

The game feels a little basic compared to games today, but I think that's ultimately a good thing.  It's not overburdened by clunky mechanics and heavy strategy.  I'd almost call it elegant, even with a few of those niddly rules inconsistencies that Wallace games tend to have.  I think the original rules don't have a tie breaker at the end.  So we just played that if anyone ended up with a tie they had a big shootout at the end with all of their cowboys (and we did).  I highly recommend this variant.  Sure, it comes down to some dice but hey, it's not that serious of a game.

Glad to have it in my collection.  Can't wait to try this again.

Combines the "German style" of boardgaming with an element of luck and gunfight.

Components are excellent. Especially the counters are very well done. The board is also very good and the pictures can't convey the feeling that this simple looking map can create.

The rules are purely written and you have to read them at least two or three times. Although I would say the game is quite simple there are a lot of rules to remember. I suggest you print one of the available player aids and give one to each player.

In order to enjoy this game you need to play it at least 2-3 times because the first time it's difficult to understand its balance and know exactly what to do.

The game play is degenerate, IMO. If you build something expensive, another player takes it away from you and you'll likely lose the game because you can't recuperate the losses (money is tight). So why are the expensive buildings even there? This game might be much better with a revised combat system that involves less die rolling and makes it harder to steal property.

And here, ladies and gentlemen, is where Martin Wallace's six-shooter fired a dud.  I find myself in very strong agreement with the most common complaints about this game;  I hate the non-simultaneous gunfight casualties, the trains are outrageously expensive for a game in which money is so tight, and the bank is 10% benefit vs. 90% liability.  And, although this is strictly personal, the theme holds absolutely no appeal for me.

I really want to love this game.  I also feel like there is a great game in there.  As it is though, I have a several problems with this game.  The rules are really poor but I can get over that. My biggest problems are the scoring and the dice chucking.  Scoring is a chore, very fiddly, and seems like they gave little thought to the scoring.  The cowboy shootouts should have had a better mechanic attached than "random".  That being said, the theme is there in spades, the components are great (although little plastic cowboys, cows and farmers would have been cooler) and it's relatively fun as is.  I just feel this could have been a real winner with some modification.  (maybe Martin Wallace will give it a retool...Way, Way Out West?) c'mon Martin!

Un gioco dove si riconosce la firma di Wallace. Impossibile limitarsi a coltivare il proprio orticello, bisogna sporcarsi le mani usando i cowboy come Bravi di manzoniana memoria, assicurarsi di essere lo sceriffo (per proteggere i propri edifici o chiudere gli occhi quando vengono a far fuori il tuo avversario), piazzare coloni dove gli altri guadagnano più punti con il bestiame, ecc. Carino e bilanciato il combattimento, che permette a chi è in svantaggio di sparare per primo. Unico neo (ma per i giochi di Wallace pare una consuetudine): la grafica dei componenti e del tabellone è pessima. E visto che anche l'occhio vuole la sua parte, non posso rigiocare una bella meccanica se non c'è anche qualche lustrino ad appagare la vista.

(1 play)  OK, we tried this game with 3 players, and I can honestly say that none of us "got it".  This one will take awhile to figure out.  It seems like nothing you do can directly help you out.  One of those "What the hell am I supposed to be doing?" games, which makes it way too hard to get on the table.

I need to play this again. It's a "typical Martin Wallace game" with a tight economic system and a set of trade-offs that's hard to internalize on the first play. Confrontation is built into the game and is heavily rewarded. Otherwise it's basically a euro. I'm not ready to rate it yet.

You have to use your cowboys to defend your cities and herds and to attack other's. So, gunfights among cowboys are very common in these cities. I really liked the game. I think I'll try some variants (the wounded cowboy, surely).

Needs another play because of the rather fiddly rules, which took a while to grasp. I am dubious about this game - I suspect that fighting is too easy - but another playing could alter my rating either way. As is usual in my experience with Warfrog, the rulebook is badly edited, but I'm pleased to see that someone has reformatted it here.

RATING: 6
My firts reaction after playing the game was to rate it low, I mean very low.  A total chaos, very hard to have a strategy, when you do it can be easily attacked and at the end it seems that all depends on the dice rolls.  Nevertheless, after a play players have to conclude that the experience was very fun.  So even when it says [i]Wallace[/i] on the box and it is possible to have some sort of a plan, this is a kind of game that has to be approached in a joy mood.  It is not that players don't have to take it seriosly, just with the right attitude.

Very nice design is what bumped this one up to an eight, in my estimation.  Typically, I don't care about theme too much, but this one nails it, and is fun playing to boot.  The bidding mechanism feels a little bit tacked-on, but everything else seems fairly well balanced - I'm looking forward to more plays.

Very rich in theme.  Plays best if all players agree to keep the game rollin' avoiding mini/maxing.  I only play the wounded cowboy variant, $10 trains, and Struggle of Empire pay out rolls for the Banks (personal payout difference of two dice then matched by the "government", 7s bank blows up). Tons of cool tactical and strategic decisions, if you want a western themed game this is the one.  Works best with 4 or 5 players.  It really has everything you need.

It's not Brass or SoE but still quite a laugh . First session caused much mirth and John Wayne impressions. Played with variant that bank robbery only gets 1d6.

Played Randy's copy April 2007; A bit more luck based than some of Martin's other games, at least at first glance.  Some bad rolls with the cowboys can cause a big swing.  Maybe there is enough rolls to even out?  Not sure.  Nice theme, though!

Y'all might be thinkin it's broken, what with all them wild-eyed reviews, but it ain't, no sir.  This here's a great game loaded with a dash of luck and a whole lotta steel-nerved stand-offs.

Really, it's not broken.  Far from it.  You'd think from some of the commetns and reviews that robbing a bank is easy, but fighting is very very risky, and best only entered if you are slightly undergunned or even in cowboys.  Plus having a bank and a jail in the same town is effectively plus 2 dice.

You only get 2 actions in a turn, and you have to bid for turn order--most of the actions have fewer available than there are players.  And with 4 or 5 players, you only have 9 turns to work with--for the math challenged you're going to get 18 "things" to do, will you use some of those buying cowboys and starting a gun fight?  If so, there goes 2 phases and your turn is over!  There's just not enough actions to go around robbing banks since it'll cost you cowboy investment and an entire action which could be better served getting money through building or "planting" cows.

Difficult choices driven by restrictions on actions and turn order keep this one tense and interesting. I'm a little torn on game balance. If the die rolls equal out, the gunfights are a see-saw affair with players typically losing out in one area only to gain control in another. But the game certainly has the potential for one person to get hot, mow down the opposing cowboys and sheriffs and run away with the game. I dunno. The gunfights are fun, but they seem somehow out of place amid all of the other, development-oriented player actions. Perhaps that dichotomy is part of the game's charm. But it also keeps this from being a perennial favorite ... Guess this is what it is - an early Martin Wallace game that shows some of the brilliance he now exhibits on a regular basis but that also definitely exhibits some rough edges, too.

A middle-weight Wallace game that is not as involving as Princes Of The Renaissance, but definitely shares similarities with it. Gunfights add to the theme, but also make the game a lot lighter. Still question the benefits of the extremely expensive train though.

RATING: 9
The Western theme is perfectly applied here, and that's probably why I rate the game so high.  

I've had mixed success introducing it to other gamers.  Many find that the gunfights introduce too much randomness into a game that would otherwise be pure Euro.  Personally, I love the gunfights and can only laugh when I watch someone throw away any chance of winning so that they can hold on to one or two buildings, usually to satisfy some strange gaming honor.

RATING: 4
Tries to be a cross between die-rolling shoot-em-up, and area majority Euro, and doesn't do either particularly well.  This is one of Wallace's worst -- uninspired, not very evocative, and chaotic and confrontational in a way that doesn't lead to people having a good time.  Go for any number of other Wallace titles rather than this one.  Other than the box art, there's nothing to recommend this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good, interactive, worker placement (from 1998! see where it all began) and area/majority control game with cowboy shoot-outs over opponent's buildings and cattle. Plays very smoothly with quick turns and fairly short playing time.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I want to like Way Out West more than I actually do. The early game when the board gets developed is dynamic and interesting; the remainder of the game less so as players build up forces and shoot it out in an endgame free-for-all.  Not that I don't enjoy rolling dice to resolve conflict- it was raucous fun seeing my lone cow beat the crap out of three enemy cowboys trying to wrangle it. But in the end the game falls a bit short relative to what's out there. Still, an impressive design for its time, before action drafting / worker placement games became popular.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Between the dice and the convoluted rules (defending a cattle by itself uses the same number of dice as a cattle AND a cowboy), this one doesn't grab me at all.  It just doesn't make any sense.

Played once (with 4 players). I expected better from this game, but as it is, it was rather a disappointment. The rules are a bit unclear, some buildings are obviously overpriced or not interesting enough, and it seems to be quite easy for a player to be out of the game quickly (with no money and almost no income). I could live with the randomness of the fights if there were not so many other negative points.

Ugly looking game from Warfrog that is heavy on theme but has little else going for it.  When it was being explained to me, it sounded fairly complex and exciting.  When played, it becomes apparent how trivial almost all aspects of the game are aside from building up jails/cowboys.  Win the race there and the rest of the game, buying cattle, etc. is just the winner spending $ to finalize victory.  Dice-based combat system is actually one of the things I didn't dislike about the game.  The costs of various buildings are way off and the overall design just doesn't feel polished.

A fun take on rummy, with nice artwork and enough interesting mechanics to make for a very tactical game.  My only complaint is that it only supports 2 players, which is probably necessary due to the limited numbers of some mushrooms.

RATING: 6
Beautiful game with a nice theme and great illustrations, but having to rearrange the cards on the table constantly is very frustrating in the long run, and the fact that the different cards are not very distinguishable in your hand makes it rather awkward and means that what would have been a 7 becomes only a 6.

I had high hopes for this one after several recommendations from gamer friends. But I don't think it beats out Jaipur for my favorite 2-player set collection game. This one has some seemingly bad corners - like when you have a hand of cards with zero matches. Or zero pans. And it is fiddly in the continual movement of cards after each and every round of play. I'll give it a few more goes and see if it has any hope of staying in my collection. Right now, it kinda falls flat.

A much more interesting theme and flavor than Jaipur. However, Jaipur has a much more elegant system and sometimes Morel feels like you're playing against the flow of the deck instead of against each other. I think they might be too similar to keep both - and I think I'd rather play Jaipur.

A really good game for 2. Basically a set collection game, where you know _almost_ all cards of the other player. Because of this, and the total number of cards of each set, you can try to screw your opponent up. But there is so much to do for yourself!
The card (mushrooms) wander very quickly through the display, and there is _always_ a card you would love to have. But your hand limit stops that an forces you to actually play some cards, too.
Tricky: Do I play the sets for victory points, or do I trade them for "jokers" to be able taking any card on the display I want?
Clever design, beautiful artwork - a really good game!

RATING: 7
A pleasant rummyesque game. To basic card drawing and melding Fungi adds the possibility of increasing your hand limit (baskets), the need for a frying pan in which to place each meld, and a choice of melding (cooking) for vps or selling mushrooms in return for greater options in your card draws. There are lots of nice thematic touches, from cider and butter to enhance the flavour of your mushrooms, to the whole game resembling the progress of a woodland walk.

The artwork is quite appealing. Card quality is somewhat less than top quality. The rules are a fairly easy read, although I found the way they are set out in the Pegasus edition less than ideal.

There are so many set-collection games, but I've yet to play one that I enjoy more than Morels. This game offers really tough decisions based on the pacing of cards entering the wandering row, and the shifting of the decay pile. It's brilliant. Played with the circular-wandering row setup, it's also not fiddly at all. I think it's grand. The scoring is rich and really makes you think, the art and theme are fabulous, and the game is quick enough to warrant another immediate play every time.

First of all, it should be played with the circular forest placement in order to reduce time spent on sliding cards around. 

It's a bit similar to Jaipur and is less elegant compared to it. These facts do not make Fungi a bad game though, it is a solid game with a decent amount of options available to choose from in most of the decisions. I'm just not sure if Fungi and Jaipur both have a place in a small collection such as mine.

Morels has a strong connection to Gin Rummy but with some added elements. The "walk through the forest"-mechanism  is a novel idea. This game completely kills Lost Cities for a light 2-player game due to the possibility for more options during game-play.

RATING: 10
it's hard to explain what makes this game so fun for us. The game play is simplistic (it's set collection in its simplest form). The art is good. And the theme is ok. But we love playing this as much as any strategic two-players game like say 51st State. It must be that it somehow manages to be greater than the sum of its parts.

May 2015:
The theme appeals to my under 5 y.o. who enjoys real mushroom hunting and forest hiking (does a kid picking up every acorn, cone or stick sound familiar?). We play open handed with some other minor rule tweaks and he is getting really good at it. Counting, planning, hand management, mushrooms recognition, tactical thinking, competitive play are skills he has been developing with this little gem. I really enjoy the game as well and would strongly recommend it for couples and families (only for 2 players though, but you could play two teams).

June 2015:
Keeping the rating high as my wife has found it interesting and enjoyable as well. The game is exciting and could be tense for the little one who squeaks watching which mushrooms could disappear before he gets to them.
The downside: constant cards shifting (the "walk through the forest" mechanic) is a bit fiddly and requires more space than I would like (making it less portable). Apart from that, still great fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.9
Really unique 2-player game where you're foraging through a forest of cards, cooking sets of mushrooms and there are also other variable in play, cards with powers to affect your points tallies, or even affect you negatively (the Destroying Angel). Nice artwork, nice theme, and fun to play!

Interesting 2 player game that can be a bit fiddly.  The movement of the fungi around can be a bit confusing.  Basically is a set collection game: get mushrooms either to sell them or to cook them for points.
Needs to be played more.
UPDATE: Finally I could take it to table again.  As in the first impression, I think it can be confusing for the first couple of games due to the movement of the cards.  But also because the cards are difficult to distinguish.  Art is superb, no doubt about it, but it is quite difficult to realize at first glanze what you have in the forest, in your hand and the discard pile, because the art is quite similar in all mushroom cards.  That makes a little of a problem.

Fungi is a light set collection for two. Basically is kinda like Bonhanza for couples, without the trading and hand sequence.
It has some nice little touches (baskets, sticks, pans) and it forces some kind of planning. Hand size is big but somewhat it constrains players and forces choices.
It has a little memorization aspect and it could be slightly annoying for some people, but that doesn't bother me.
As a couple, we are in deeper games, but this could enter the rotation when we seek lighter fare...

Really enjoying this one! It's a creative blend of different elements that we love: easy rules with many  difficult and challenging tactical decisions. Plus it's one of the most attractive games we have seen in a long time.

Rating likely to go up after more plays. In our last game, my wife edged me 22-21. Loved it!

Purchased from Two Lanterns and are waiting for hand-crafted foraging sticks.

UPDATE: Raised from 9 to 10. This is one amazing game. It has everything we could possibly want from a 2-P game and is it ever FUN! 

How often do you get a game that is deliciously tense but enjoyable, has been precisely designed so everything fits together and compels you to play your very best if you expect to win? Plus it was thoroughly play tested before it went to print and the rule book has answered every question we have had. 

A brilliant effort by a first-time designer who also is active on BGG. Buy it, enjoy it then buy some for your friends. It will be interesting to see what other games Brent Povis designs for us!

Such a unique, elegant game for two. The rules are simple, but the implementation is really clever as each player pursues different mushroom varieties and paths to victory.

// I like this game more than my wife does, which is too 
bad since it's such an accessible 2-player filler. The 
theme goes a long way for me, but it's a fun set collection 
game in general. There's a newer edition out with 
supposedly better artwork, but the trade off is that the 
mushroom  names are in Latin on each card, which I don't

A clever and challenging 2-player set collection game.  The constraints on hand size and card play (combined with the fact that you cannot discard) really make this game tricky, tense and fun.  The theme is different and refreshing as well.  There's a lot of luck of the draw, but it seems to balance out with other mechanics.  One minor quibble I have with Morels is that you constantly need to shift cards down the tableau unless you arrange them in a circle instead.

Decent set collection game with a market mechanic (a la Through the Ages) that makes it slightly more interesting than other games like it. The theme is really boring, and I thought the night deck really should have included at least one or two bad cards to undercut the advantage they usually give. I don't see this holding my interest over many plays but I'll hold on to it for now.

If you like set collection games and want a slightly different twist on it, this one is a pretty harmless and light entry into that genre.

For me, the game was pretty dry and there was nothing really exciting about the game to make me want to play again.  There is a little interest in the hand management aspect and balancing your needs vs. denying your opponent the cards he's looking for, but overall it just didn't have anything to bring that fun factor or add enough interesting decisions for me.

A super fun quick play (30 min) for my wife and I. Truly a staple of our 2player friendly game collection, we play at least one round nearly every game night! We absolutely love the theme and artwork, the set building gameplay is alot of fun too! Very strategic but not super head to head competitive which is great for couples. I just wish we had discovered this game while the first edition run with the mini pans and foraging sticks was still available. The cardboard pop out tokens are just fine, but I got some serious fomo once I saw the deluxe game bits! Gonna have to make my own I guess...

2 player game about collecting and cooking mushrooms. I suppose the theme is there but it's not exactly a theme that interests me much. Cards are available to both players for drafting, so you need to take them at the appropriate time before they either disappear or your opponent takes them. The more of one type of mushroom you collect, the better.

I'd heard a lot of praise for this game, but honestly didn't seek it out because it's about mushrooms - which we hate!  But Scott was convinced by the folks at our FLGS that this was worth playing, so he picked it up.

Morels is a fast-paced set-collection game, where you're trying to get as many of one type of mushroom as you can while keeping within your hand limit.  A key is deciding when to "cash out" by cooking up the mushrooms and locking those in for points.  Alternatively you can sell them for the short-term flexibility of walking sticks, which open up more choice cards.

There's a lot to like here - my main beef is just that the line of cards has to be constantly moved, to the point that you wish there was a conveyor belt to handle it for you.  I suspect in future plays we'll just figure out some sort of circular arrangement instead...

The cards have their point values in their corners.  So if you want to know what you have in your hand, memorize the points.  Or just refer to the cards as their point values e.g. (1,1), (1,2), etc...  When I play, I just refer to the background art in the corner e.g. A white-bark, short-green, tall-green, roof, etc..

Seems like a bad design decision to me.  It makes the game frustrating having to look through my hand to find the names of the cards.

Pretty easy gateway game for 2P. I love good 2P games. The down-to-earth theme (collecting mushrooms in the forest) is great, and so is the artwork. You collect sets of mushrooms in a shared forest, so there is possibility for blocking the other player too. I found it to be girlfriend-friendl.

Mediocre hand management and set collection game. Inelegant, chaotic and frustrating with few interesting choices and too much unnecessary complexity (1 of the 6 pages in the rule book is dedicated entirely to explaining the one bad mushroom). No idea what folks are seeing in this. Lost Cities and Jaipur are the two I most often see this compared with, and both are far better, cleaner designs. 

This review nails every issue I have with the game:

This one reminds me of Jaipur, but I like Morels a little better. In both games, you're collecting sets, but the mechanisms force you to use cards in ways other than as parts of sets. In Morels' case, the chief dilemma is whether to add a card to a set or discard it to increase your purchasing power.

RATING: 10
I don't give out 10's freely. This is a perfect quick 2p card game. The decisions are tough from turn one, hands are varied tremendously by the shuffle (totally different game when pans or baskets are bottom-decked or Morels are in the initial tableau). The art may seem cutesy but the game has plenty of depth and is endlessly replayable. 

Try playing for a dollar a point!

EDIT: Morels seems to me to be the only cardgame that truly solves the inherent flaw in cardgames: that some hands, because of the way the cards fall, are always going to be a total wash.

I'm not talking about games like Mascarade of course, but specifically set collection games... I guess you'd say the 'rummy' genre.

Because of the forest layout and the walking sticks either player can draw any card, if they want it badly enough, and if they've planned ahead for it coming up at an inconvenient time by stocking up on sticks.

For example, in Jaipur, which I've also played a lot, there will be sessions where in two of the three hands one player will draw much more of the rubies and gold. There's nothing the other player can do.

In Morels that never happens. 

I think it's easy to look at it as a light, family themed rummy game and miss the fact that it's actually a pretty  revolutionary design.

Edit: So glad to see that this game has recovered from Tom Vasel's unfounded bad review, in which he:

Assumed it is a children's game,

Demonstrated a complete lack of understanding of the game's tactics,

And damned the game with incredibly faint praise by comparing it to freaking Balloon Cup.

The average rating is now above a 7 and the game has gone through multiple printings. Congrats, Brent Povis and Two Lanterns games for hanging tough.

If you are one of the 11,500 youtube viewers who watched that garbage review and didn't realize that Mr. Vasel... let's say "had an off day", do yourself a favor and take another look at Morels.

EDIT: I finally got a copy of Fungi, the import version. The art is great and I like the Latin names. Most importantly, the game totally holds up. It's still far and away the best of its genre.

My one complaint - and it's minor- with both the US and import editions is that I wish the card stock was as good as the coated cards you get in Jaipur, for example. It would be awesome to riffle shuffle that big deck and not worry about bending cards.

Deluxe edition? Maybe one day? I'd definitely be in... :)

A pleasant 2-player card game with very nice art (2014 English/German edition). Mechanically it is a bit of a mash-up between Lost Cities and Jaipur but that's not such a bad thing.

Including the card distribution on the cards is a nice functional touch but it can be a bit hard to identify the different fungi types from across the table and upside down and in your hand when the main graphic is obscured - a small graphic for each type of mushroom alongside the stick and pan value of the fungi would have helped. A minor niggle though.

Players are hiking through the woods, hunting different species of mushrooms, to cook/eat, or sell.  Lovely two player card game, where a large deck of mushroom cards is swiftly worked through.  Eight cards make the forest path, which you may draft a card off.  If you have traded mushrooms in for hiking sticks, you may pay these to go deeper into the path to pluck out the best cards.  Either way, the cards shuffle down the path into the "decay", a tipping bucket of cards that can be collected, or it resets when it contains four cards.  Sets of muchrooms can be melded with a frying pan for points, or cashed in for hiking sticks.  

Delightful game, obviously influenced by the stronger Kosmos two player titles, and works very well.  Plays quickly, offers up some very difficult choices, tactical in that you have to watch/deny mushrooms that your opponent is collecting, and has some wonderful timing problems to solve.  When playing out the end game I was reminded of the time pressure of the closing moments of Lost Cities - no higher priase than that.

[b]OPINIÓN PERSONAL:[/b]
El Fungi es un juego de reglas simples. Tanto es así, que en la primera partida te puedes encontrar un poco perdido: entiendes las normas y sabes que tienes que ir reuniendo setas iguales para ganar puntos, pero no pillas muy bien qué tipo de estrategia te conviene seguir, por lo que acabas cogiendo las primeras setas que te van saliendo.

Según vas jugando varias partidas, vas calibrando mejor el valor que tiene cada cosa y lo que te merece la pena coger en cada momento, pero ahí te encuentras con el primer gran problema del juego: el azar tiene un peso bastante elevado.

Ahí es cuando alguno dirá que es posible controlarlo, que puedes ir llevando la cuenta de las cartas que coge el otro y de las que quedan por salir (hay una tarjeta en la que te vienen cuántas setas de cada tipo hay en la baraja), pero es que entonces te topas con el segundo problema de Fungi: al ser tan simple y rápido, no merece la pena quemarse el cerebro con él (y de hecho, pensarse demasiado las cosas podría alargarlo en exceso y hacerlo soporífero). Por tanto, acabas cogiendo más o menos lo que te va viniendo y confiando en que la dama fortuna te sonría más a ti que a tu oponente. 

Está claro que no es un juego estratégico, pero es que además hay que tener claro que la interacción con el rival se limita a coger alguna seta que pudiera haberle interesado a él, lo que lo hace aún más flojo.

Por compararlo con algún otro, sus mecánicas son muy similares a las del Jaipur, así que si tenéis ese juego ya sabéis por dónde van los tiros (de hecho, no aconsejaría comprar Fungi si ya se tiene Jaipur, pues son demasiado similares).


[b]PD:[/b] Recomiendo no intentar distinguir las setas por el nombre/dibujo, se puede hacer muy confuso. Es mejor fijarse únicamente en los puntos/bastones que dan al cocinarse/venderse, pues no hay dos setas iguales en ese aspecto.

Interesting and unusual theme.   Good art style.   The line mechanic a little like Small World and that ilk, where you can pay to get cards further up the line.   Sets of mushrooms can be sold for buying power, or cooked for points.   You need a pan to score each set.   It's pretty basic set collection after that.   Would play again a few more times, but that's probably the ceiling for this filler.

Nagyon megtetszett elsőre ez a jó kis set collection, gyüjtögetős játék, amit feleséggel, barátnővel is nyugodtan lehet játszani a főzős témája miatt. Természetesen csak vicceltem :), a könnyed, mégis elgondolkodtató játékmenet miatt. Jól meg kell gondolni, természetesen a másik játékos lehetőségeit is megvizsgálva, hogy a nyolc elérhető lehetőség közül melyikre érdemes hajtani, figyelembe véve a sor végéről a komposztálóba hulló lapokat is. A kosár és az éjszakai lapok eléggé értékesek. A játék hossza is éppen ideális, hogy egyből lehessen kérni egy visszavágót. (2017.04.10)

Solid two player game of set collection with a nice theme. Cards are lovely to look at and good quality. The game is a pleasant challenge without giving you too much to think about. If Arboretum feels like too much for the brain, then Fungi/Morels is definitely a good alternative option - ideal for weeknights when a bit worn out.

Right out of the box, the cards are really high quality. Made of very thick cardstock. The card compartment fits sleeves (65x90mm) but can't contain all the cards when stack.

[b][Update][/b]: I still don't get the buzz about the game. Right now, what I'm thinking is that to fully enjoy this game, you have to play aggressively. Meaning, not all mushrooms are for you to cook (for VPs) but some are meant to be sold to get foraging sticks. With this, you can enter deeper into the jungle (by paying with 1 foraging stick per card that you skip) and snag cards that are far more valuable than relying on cards/mushroom that are available at your feet (available for free).

So far, in all my plays, I've never went deeper into the jungle. All mushrooms that I got, I focused on selling them to get VPs. I need to change my play from now on.

I played Morels for the first time tonight and had a lot of fun.  I had read a review where someone was complaining about moving the cards all the time.  I rolled my eyes at the time, but soon realized that, with a notch in my table, this was a chore.  Oh well, no way around that.  The art is gorgeous, as others have mentioned.  I'd hate to foul that up, but it would be nice to show the card identity so it can be read on both sides, allowing for the suggested layout.  We oriented the cards sideways to get around this very minor issue.  I need to play a few more times before deciding on a numerical rating.  For now, I'd say Morels is a cool, light game card propelled a bit higher by impressive artwork and a thoughtful designer who put a nice message on and signed the package my game arrived in.  OH WAIT - one other thing.  My wife and I didn't know if there was a Destroying Angel in the night deck (there isn't).  Assuming that such a card existed made choosing the night cards that much harder.  I think the game should be expanded to throw a night DA in once and again.  Perhaps, one could shuffle nine cards (w/ the DA) and only use eight?  Anyway, I liked that aspect of our mis-played game.

Morels is a nice little 2 player rummy variant, made all the better by lovely artwork and a cohesive theme.  The "walk in the forest" concept works well and managing the card hand limit and timing issues to get the right cards gives it just enough head scratching to make it interesting.  My wife loves this one and is very, very difficult to beat.

A short set collection game with enough advanced strategy to make players really think about what cards they want to hang on to and which they need to burn to make room for the rest. Games feel the same after a few plays, not sure how to change that.

Fungi (which is the version of Morels that I have) is an enjoyable set collection  and drafting game that has a little bit more going on than I initially thought it might. Most of this revolves around the strict hand limit of 8 cards, the fact that you may not go above it and discard down, and finding ways to manage it. Cards are in a drafting line where you only have access to the last two cards unless you spend  currency. After every action you're adding the last card in the line card to a decay pile and refreshing the line. People can take cards from the Decay pile but, as soon as a 5th card would be added, you discard the other 4 cards. There is also an element managing your speed through the deck (because when all cards are gone the game ends) and the drafting line. Even though there are some very different mechanisms, it had a similar feel to Jaipur: collect sets, manage your hand limit carefully, and try to limit your opponent from taking good things. Regardless of which edition of Morels you have, I would strongly recommend the circular setup detailed in the Fungi rules for less constant shifting of cards. I'd probably also recommend using the streamlined "Fly Agaric" rules of Fungi over the Destroying Angel's rules in Morels. I also prefer Fungi's art aesthetic, but wish there were tokens instead of cards for the walking sticks. Pretty good!

RATING: 5
Neither love nor hate, though the opportunity cost (I could have gotten a much better game for the same price) irks me a little bit. 

Good:
-like the art
-like the idea
-components are decent quality 
-some agonizing decisions

Bad:
-destroying angels, for all the ink spent on explaining them, what they do to your hand, how long for, and so on, are a non-event. It actually remains unclear to me how you would even end up getting stuck with one since the flow of cards, and alternate actions options let you weasel out of taking one. Seems dumb to me. 
-the "walking" mechanic, while maybe a good idea initially in the planning stages, is poorly implemented; a classic example of design v user experience, attempts at alternate approaches not withstanding. Constantly moving the cards gets as annoying as everyone has already indicated, esp when you're trying to keep track of all the cards in your hand. 

Not sure what tweaks would improve this game, perhaps a way of trading, or even auctioning cards?

Morels offers a certainly unique theme over a fairly straight forward push-your-luck set collecting game. This is a perfectly reasonable game to own, for me however, Jaipur and a few others beat it out and it isn't the sort of thing one needs multiple versions of.

Kudos to the publisher on the original release of the game for hand making the bits inside. What a truly devoted dude.

A charming walk through the woods for two. This game does so many things right. Choices are simple yet engaging. The mechanics fit the theme, mostly (I'm not sure why I get so excited to get decaying butter and cider, for example). The playing time of 25-30 minutes feels just right. The components are excellent. I would prefer if the cards were a little thicker but that's a minor quibble. One other minor problem is moving the cards down the line every turn, it gets a little fiddly. But the bottom line is this game is wonderful.

Disappointing.  I was expecting more after the reviews and hype. The "sticks" do help to dig deeper for the cards you want, but the uncertainty of which moon cards get drawn, and the randomness of how the cards come out, including the pans and baskets, all conspire to make this a chaotic luck fest. Rating 4

addendum: tried once more and seemed a little better. Still don't especially like the randomness of the moon cards. Increased rating to a 6.

Nem rossz. De azért nem annyira elegáns, mint a Jaipur a folyamatos kártyaadminisztráció miatt. A kézlimit a fő momentum, hiszen lapot eldobni nem lehet, csak a gyilkos galócával lehet megszabadulni a felesleges lapoktól. Nagyon figyelni kell mi marad a kézben. A rothadáspakli egy nagyon jó taktikai elem, de elsőre még nem éreztem hogyan lehet jól használni. Jó lesz ez, de az már biztos, hogy nem lesz akkor kedvenc, mint a Jaipur. Ár/érték aránya viszont nagyon rendben van: inzertes doboz, egy halom jó minőségű kártya 2700 Ft-ért.

This is a very good game for couples (no surprise).  I've got four other similar 2-player games and this one falls very nicely right in the middle of the pack.  

I like it just a tad more than Odin's Ravens and a full 2 ratings points more than Lost Cities.  Jaipur and especially Traders of Carthage, however, are meatier and allow for more player control as well as more indirect interaction.  For those reasons I would choose one of the latter two to play with a gamer friend as medium-light games.

That said, for a fun, relaxing-but-not-boring under 30-minute game with a girlfriend/wife, I would recommend Morels before ALL the games I've mentioned.  It has just the right mix of delightful artwork, theme, choice/control, randomness, limited interaction/obstruction and length to be played casually in a relaxed setting (in a park or just the two of you after dinner).

This is a nice, fairly light 2-player set collection game with a cool theme for someone who enjoys gourmet mushrooms. I had heard it favorably compared with Lost Cities and was slightly disappointed to find that it didn't hold as much tension for me. Still it offers some mildly interesting decisions. To play it well requires a sharp eye looking out for what the opponent is collecting. Some people may be turned off by the fiddliness of having to adjust the line of forest cards after every single turn - this game needs to come with its own personal conveyer belt.  For 2-player set collection games, I would rate it a little under Lost Cities but over Jaipur.

This is the most gripping and simple two player game that I know of. Can teach a non gamer in the matter of minutes. Grade based on fun factor, replay, creativity, simplicity, and back story. Very well done.

The cards are thin so i sleeved them. Night cards just got a special symbol painted on the back(or at first a different colored sleeve) 

My house rule with the angels are that they are with held from the deck until the dealing is done. Then shuffled in after so there is no chance of starting your hand with one.

I bought this game thinking that it was the version that included the handcrafted sticks..I was wrong and disappointed at the seller whom was misleading. But after the first play I was completely satisfied. I soon after bought my own two little doll pans and carved my own sticks which in the grand scheme of things will be worth a whole lot more to my daughter when I hand this down to her :) 
As of Jan 2013..my favorite game

Viszonylag egyszerű mechanizmus köré sikerült egy nagyon hangulatos, és eléggé agyalós játékot építeni. Mindez lemegy 20 perc alatt. A konfrontáció minimálisra is szorítható, így pároknak is nagyon ajánlott.
Két hibája van csak az én szememben:
1. az erdő "adminisztrálása", azaz a kártyák tologatása nagyon fárasztó
2. elég komoly benne a memória elem. Nem árt, ha tisztában vagy vele, hogy mi van az ellenfeled kezében, nomeg mik vannak a dobott lapok között. Ez nem is olyan egyszerű feladat.

RATING: 6
Fairly simple drafting and set collection game with some original ideas to keep things interesting. The primary concern of the game is getting around your hand limit in one way or another.

The game should appeal to card counters as keeping track of mushrooms that have been removed from the game is quite important. It's also a little cumbersome, requiring the card row to be shifted each and every turn.

RATING: 7.9
Very cool card game for two. The night cards are an interesting twist, but the sticks don't seem to have a lot of value. What they do is clear, but they are rarely used. I only see them used when racing for the last Morel card, either to complete your set or to deny the set to your opponent.

Very thematic and fun, but runs a little long for my taste.

Fun two player game that reminds me a little of Bohnanza or The Reef. The Pegasus version has nice artwork certainly, but I much prefer the clear artwork and production of the Two Lanterns version. Plays quickly, and has some fun decisions to be made.

I think this game was a bit overhyped. It's a very streamlined auction style hand builder. You take what's available from a common tableau, paying extra for some cards that are higher up, attempting to lay down matching pairs or special items (frying pans, etc). It's ok for a lighter game, but I never felt any tension except maintaining a limited hand size (which can and SHOULD BE increased asap!) Decent, but probably not worth the $25 asking price. This should be $10-15 max.

A perfectly quaint 2-player stroll, collecting mushrooms as you go. Should you sell your mushrooms now to earn walking sticks to help you run ahead of your opponent? Or, should you instead save your 'shrooms and cook them later for maximum points? It's a well balanced affair unless you discard too many pans early in the game. You must save a few with which to cook! Also, it's too easy to avoid the negative avenging angel cards.

An excellent two-player game on par with the Kosmos two-player line.  Lots of interesting decisions to make while playing.  Plays in about 20 minutes and is easy to teach and pick up.  I love the theme and how the mechanics match it quite well.  It makes me want to go out and forage for mushrooms!

Sold Fungi, kickstarted Morels.  I prefer the plain english mushroom names on the cards, and the artwork in Morels more.  Plus handcrafted bits!

UPDATE: Switching from Fungi to Morels was a good move.  It's more approachable, and the handcrafted bits are way better than cards.  It's a small things, but the tactile quality really helps.  This is a great game for tired parents of toddlers when you want to play a game together like you used to, but you don't have the energy to play a 90 minute Euro game.  This is easy breezy, but still offers some really difficult decisions.  And there's depth in here... Destroying Angels are totally fine if you have enough baskets :)

This is a fantastic two player game that is fast paced and addicting.  My boyfriend and I have been playing it almost everyday for the last seven months. Want proof? Oh, I have proof, my friends. We have been recording our scores for every game, usually playing a three-game series, so we can claim a true victory at the end. The two key elements that I love about this game are a) it has the perfect balance between strategy and luck and b) one of the reasons we like to play so much is because there are a vast number of strategies you can use, which means every game has a different outcome, usually resulting in one of us exclaiming, "I can't believe you did that! Rematch!" Game ensues...

First of all, I really like this game. The game runs in about 45 minutes, and my partner and I like the satisfaction we get when we can put down a bunch of cards at once (collecting points). 

The premise of this game is adorable. The players are foraging for mushrooms in the woods, searching high and low for tasty fungi for a hearty meal. 

At first glace at the directions, the game could seem too simple. But the beauty of this game is the replay-ability. The game feels low stress, and feels like a friendly competitive game where the players are working together. Yes, one player will win, but both players end up feeling good about their progress at the end.  

Pros:
- Simple game (easy to learn, fast to play)
- Replayable
- Set collecting game

Con:
- It can be hard to plan strategy ahead of time
- A lighter game compared to many

*As of 4-11-14 I am increasing the rating from a 6.5 to a 7 because I enjoy playing this game, and I will play it when suggested most of the time (unless I thirst for a heavier game).

Looks to be a relaxing "couples" game which has a small foot print/is portable. Looking forward to getting this I the table.

A fun and interesting set collection card game with cool mechanics. Very nice artwork, too. Some people say it's too fiddly pushing the cards around after every turn, but if you lay out the cards in a rectangle instead of a line, you can just let the end of the row migrate around the rectangle from turn to turn and you barely ever have to slide any cards at all.

This game fits an important niche for me; short 2 player game with a bit of strategy and some interesting decisions. It plays for us in about 20 minutes and our first play was close, second a blow out, and third a tie as we started to each form strategies. If you really want to get in to the game you can go so far as to count the mushroom cards and keep close track of what the other person is gathering. I really like the constant shifting of the cards mechanic which is meant to simulate a walk through the woods. I also love the artwork on the cards.

Morels is an engaging two player set collection card game with a decent amount of thinking going on, and a lot of love, artwork and thematic integrity.
The game involves collecting and playing sets of like cards representing mushrooms. It's an atypical theme, but it is clearly loved by the designer, Brent Povis, and the artist, Vince Dorse, made some nice flights of fancy, like Fairies on the night card of the Fairy Ring, Japanese arches behind the Shitake, and what appears to be a Specter or a Dementor on the Destroying Angel.
Unlike Lost Cities, the set collection is played together to be scored, with a pan and possibly other accessories, when you eat the mushrooms.  If mushrooms are sold, the currency gained are collecting sticks (the kind a child might beat against trees in the wood).  Baskets, logically enough increase hand size limits.
The rules are nicely written; concise, but covering all the possibilities, and penned with an obvious fondness for the subject matter.  One might easily think it was written by a hobbit, given the fondness for the topic, and for eating!
The game doesn't take too long for what it is, and moves along to a conclusion, at the same time offering some thoughtful choices about which action to take on one's turn given cards available, opponent's strategy, timing, etc.
I really like this game- even though I didn't like mushrooms until my twenties- and I think the love included in the game, in the custom bits, in the personal note on the packaging I received it in all add up to something a little more than the sum of the parts.
I'm starting this at a 7.5, and I hope I get to play it a lot with my spouse, with my daughter, with people I love.  I'm a game collector more than a mushroom collector, but I'm glad I collected this one, and I bet many other owners will be glad too.

RATING: 7.5
This is a very pleasant, well designed game. It's lovingly crafted (the wooden sticks are awesome!). The game is very easy to learn: on your turn, do one of five things clearly listed on a reference card. 

It's basically a walk through the woods, managing probability, timing actions correctly, and trying to deny your opponent precious mushrooms. Such a unique, well executed game.

I love the look and feel of Morels. It's pretty straightforward set collection, and I find it to be relaxing. I think it's one of the better games I have to play with my significant other who isn't a gamer. The worst part of this game we found was the tedium of sliding the cards over after every draw. Yes, it sort of simulated walking through the woods, but it made playing the game a bit more of a chore than I would have liked. 

We began playing with the circular set up from the forums here, which helps a lot. The solo variant is also very challenging.

Waaay too fiddly for my tastes:

* A lot if time is spent on moving cards. After each player's turn you need to put sth in the decay pile, possibly discarding the pile, then move the forest cards (although the latter can be avoided by using the circular variant). 

* Hand sizes are large and can become quite different between players. It is hard to remember your current hand size, let alone check if your opponent's hand is over limit.

* Poor layout (Fungi, Pegasus ed.): Why, o why didn't they add a colored border to each type of mushroom? The artwork is beautiful, but quite distracting. It is very hard to distinguish the cards at a glance.

* I like the idea of the decay pile, but the limit of 4 cards is annoying and means more card-moving. (I suppose a sliding/trailing decay pile behind the forest might have worked slightly better?)

It’s refreshing to see a game start with the premise that mushrooms should be eaten cooked.

There are a few games that pull me in completely, that relax me while I play even if they allow you to be a God’s honest shit. [thing=40628]Finca[/thing] is one of these; [thing=119432]Snowdonia[/thing] is another. Morels isn’t quite.

It’s hard to say why, other than that perhaps I just don’t enjoy set collection games as much as the next fellow. Thinking about it, it really is one of my least favorite mechanics, so my rating for Morels says something good about the game that I don’t shrink from saying: It is a very engaging game. It makes set collecting fun, and it replaces [thing=12002]Jambo[/thing] for me, which is half of what I set out to do in buying it. I also bought it because I thought Jane would like it, and she does—even more than I do. I think it’s a credit to its genre, certainly a good couples game to consider.

Shifting the cards down every turn is undeniably fiddly, but it’s acceptable even if the repetition of moving, then group-sliding, then straightening the cards can come to be annoying. Shifting the path into the decay every turn can start to feel like playing Jaina against Argagarg—and if you know what that means you should consider whether Morels is the game for you.

This is probably the foremost member of a group of games I like to call “Games That Would Be Better Played on a Conveyer Belt”.[color=#ffffff]a9Z4MnAx[/color]

I've only won once against my partner; just thought i'd mention that. I love the theme. I find this game quite tense, you see cards coming up that you want, so do you sell to jump the line? or go for the freebies? or go for the decay? Go for big pointers? Many low points with some acv or butter? Night card? A mix of everything? Make hay while the sun shines because your opponent is looking at the same cards you are and that ending is coming up pretty fast! A great addition for any predominantly 2 player gamer collection.

I have to admit, the theme and the art help this one a lot.  Yummy delicious mushrooms were definitely enough to get me on board.  But even if I didn't love mushrooms as much as I do (and seriously, I love mushrooms), I think I'd still enjoy this little card game.  It's light but clever.  The central decision is how long to hold onto a collection of mushrooms before cooking or selling them, but part of that decision is looking ahead and seeing what's going to happen with the stack. The decay pile is interesting because it gives you an opportunity to sweep up several rejected cards at the same time... but only if you have room in your hand.  So there's a little planning, a little risk assessment, a little deliciousness. I play more long two-player games than short ones these days, but if I ever want a short two-player game, this is definitely one I'll pull out. (1 play)

The first game I picked up to specifically play with my wife and it's only hit the table on a couple of occasions.  This game taught me that I won't (normally) be playing 2 player games with her - but that isn't a bad thing. She sees gaming more as a social activity to be played with a group. She doesn't have the focus to sit down and play a game with just me for any length of time (having a toddler doesn't help). All of this is good stuff - the game is just fine, but nothing special imo. It gets pulled out on occasion when it's just me and another friend.

Morels feels a little like a 2-player variant of Bohnanza, but more exciting, more fun, and with more purpose. The art is remarkable; after spending about 10 plays enjoying every illustration, it's no surprise that the illustration concept descriptions seem just as involved as the descriptions given to Magic: the Gathering's artists (see http://www.twolanternsgames.com/Morels__The_Cards.html).

This is one of those games that I'll never get rid of. I expect to be taking leisurely strolls through the woods for a while yet.

My only (only only only, emphasis on the only) very minor (minor minor minor, emphasis on the minor) complaint is that I wish each card had the number of copies in the deck printed on it. That would make the card manifest printed on the player aid unnecessary to reference during the average game.

To be honest, I didn't know anything about this game when I picked it up at GenCon this year. My wifeis into morel foraging, so I grabbed it thinking I could entice her to play it with me given the theme. 

I wasn't really expecting much of a game (because I hadn't heard about it before). Boy, was I wrong! This is an incredibly enjoyable game. We both liked it a lot and I have a feeling it will be getting to the table a lot. 

Thanks for a great game!

Morels is a solid two-player experience. The give-and-take is much more open than it is in a two-player game like Lost Cities as more cards are on the table and can be acquired in a more strategic way.

Each turn gives you options, the forest lets you plan ahead to a degree and the moon cards add that little element of testing your luck. It comes together in a beautiful and thoughtful game with a lovely theme. The card movement is still fiddly though.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (July 2015)

Harmless light game, it has some interesting decisions but mainly I found it to be obvious. Morels has a high degree of luck in many ways, but the offender for me were the night cards. They are very powerful and you draw one of them face down so you never know beforehand if it will fit your cards or not. As they are so powerful, they dictate your whole strategy. Mercifully the playtime is very short, so the luck factor doesn’t bother me that much.

Having to refill the forest each turn (slide the cards) gets boring and repetitive rather quickly.
 
The theme is novel, I don’t like it nor dislike it. The art is very good and the game aids are excellent as well. 

Bottom line, it is way too light for my tastes, If I wanted to play a light 2 player game I would play instead Schotten-Totten. I think it can be a good game to introduce someone to the hobby but, overall, I found it to be forgettable. Already removed it from my wish list.

Some parts of this I really enjoy, others I find a bit too swingy.  It's easy to get "stuck" and have no options, which I don't like (it's like player elimination in a 2p game) and the randomness/extremely fast mov't of the cards makes it hard to plan, which I also don't like.  The theme is neat and I think even integrated fairly well, I def liked it better than my husband so the likelihood of this hitting the table is pretty low.

Initial impression: a really nice hand management game, quick turns with real decisions.

My copy is the Fungi version from Pegasus. It has a major graphic design failing in that you can't glance at your hand, or the cards in the forest, and quickly tell which mushroom is which. The art is quite nice but they really should have included some iconography or colour coding to be able to quickly distinguish.

This is a set-collecting game with the unusual theme of cooking mushrooms. Unfortunately the gameplay is just that simple. You draw a card every turn and try to complete your sets of mushrooms.

When a copy became available on the market where I live I couldn't resist buying this game. I love mushrooms, shaped as mystic aliens, hiding in fairy tale forests... and some are delicious as well.

After a few plays: at first I was worried about how well the mechanics would work. Would it become to static? Too fiddly? Lack alternative strategies? One game was enough to find out that there's more game to it, than I initially thought. 

As in many games you could probably experience a disastrous combination of cards, practically ruin you chance to win. However the dynamics of pan & walking-stick values, baskets & card limit, choice between mushroom or pan, butter & cider, all together open up for a whole lot of options, that makes it possible to balance the advantage of rare high value mushrooms and lower value ones.

Jaipur has in my view a notch better mechanics. Morels is not far off and has better artwork. Both are a bit fiddly, because of components used and setup. Anyway, I gave Jaipur an 8 and so far Morels gets a 7.5.

An elegant hand management and set collection fare with a unique theme of foraging for mushrooms in order to sell them to be able to venture deeper into the forest or cook them for mushroom varietal points.

A game that I could definitely see playing with my significant other or other non-gamer family member.

I could have liked the game because it's mechanics are great. The biggest dissapointment is the lay-out of the cards. I have to go though my cards over and over again to see what I own, and what it was that I was collecting. The artwork is great, but having to look at my handcards is really slowing the game down. It would have been great if there were colloured symbols in the corners so you could see immediately what you have in hand. Somewhat like the cards in Ticket to ride

Wow. I really enjoy this game. It feels in a way kindred to Lost Cities even though it shares little in common bar the genre of a 2-player card game.

Where Lost Cities feels competitive, Morels feels constructive. Like you are building towards a great collection. Your opponent doesn't feel in your face but more like an annoying bee buzzing off to the side.

There is a quant charm that I struggle to place in this game, but I certainly do enjoy experiencing it.

It's been described as "challenging and relaxing".  After playing, I totally get that!  I think this is a great game.  Not real heady or complicated, but it can be challenging nonetheless.  It requires some thought and planning, and is a great wind down for my wife and I.  We enjoyed meeting the designer at BGG.CON, bought a copy and had him sign it!  We love our Morels!

Upped the rating to a 10 after a great game last night.  I lost, but hey, I really like it!  I think it might be a "perfect moment" game, but when that perfect moment comes, I can't think of another game that would fill Morel's shoes in complex ease and relaxing artwork.

Backed it back down to a 9.  It just doesn't have the depth I need to give it a 10.  But I do really like it, so I'll keep it in the upper tier!

This nicely themed card game, portraying a walk in the woods foraging for mushrooms, adds interesting decisions to the basic set collection mechanic to reward those who manage their hands well and time their plays efficiently. Morels is an enjoyable, competitive and quick game that just begs for repeated plays.
[hr]In Fungi cards are labeled by their scientific name as opposed to Morels which uses their common name. Also, Fungi substituted two of the original Morel cards with different mushrooms indigenous to Europe, namely Birch bolete for Fairy Ring and Fly agaric for Destroying Angel

There's a small rule change concerning Destroying Angels/Fly agaric, but all copies of Morels from 3rd edition onward include this change as a variant option. Basically, the length of time one is hampered by that card has been simplified as until the end of your next turn. See the files section for an update from Brent Povis, the designer, detailing this variant along with an optional method for arranging the forest path.

While both versions include an overview card listing the card frequency for each type of card, the Fungi version has the added benefit of including that number printed atop the cards. Also, the Fungi version lists card stats on both the left and right side of cards making them visible regardless of which way you fan cards in your hand, whereas the Morels version only lists stats on the left side of cards.

This is becoming one of my favorite two-player games.  There’s a surprising amount of strategy involved for what’s essentially a card drafting and hand management game, largely because it add an element of memorization (for the Decay) and a time limit that forces you to think several steps ahead.  There’s a degree of randomization, but it doesn’t throw the balance of the game off too much, just adds an element of chance to things.

It’s cute thematically (and a good example of a game that isn’t based on violence, if that’s what you’re looking for) and has some nice design and artwork.  It’s a quick, easy-to-learn two-player game, portable and with no need for a ton of space, and it’s very replayable.  A great bar/vacation game.

Rating based on solo variant play:

As a 2-player game it really didn't click at all. I'd much rather just pull out Jaipur to be honest. 

I recently however discovered the solo variant which transformed my experience significantly. Fun! I'm thankful to whoever took the initiative as it has breathed life back into a game I very much wanted to like from the beginning but had instead been relegated to my gaming graveyard for a loooong time. A handful of the things that stand out: 

1) Selling cards for walking sticks to avoid end game points penalties. It helps to provide the tension I missed. Before, I felt very little desire (pressure) to forage more than what was at my feet.
 
2) The circular set-up feels much more fluid. And the option to move the deck further into the forest or keep it where it is adds a nice element of strategic choice, which I found was missing in the original.

3) The AI actions can change the landscape of the cards quite dramatically. It's not just a dummy placeholder kind of thing. It does interesting things to the game that make you rethink your strategy.  

4)The purpose of the Destroying Angel is more tangible to me, and more multi-layered. Early game is a good moment to pounce on one as you maybe haven't cooked anything yet, so the penalty is minimal and you're getting rid of a DA card that the AI could potentially use to your disadvantage by removing desired cards from the forest and getting through the deck faster; two new elements that add another layer of thought.    

5) The end game scoring is just more interesting. As with the previously mentioned walking sticks, the pressure to get cards out of your hand to avoid points penalties at the end is a welcome addition.  

6) The fact that the game ends if you cook the Morels is a nice touch. They become both a blessing and a curse as you try to justify clogging your hand with them. 

In short, the solo variant brought Morels to life. Now I can finally enjoy foraging for mushrooms and enjoy the great (original) artwork, and play with those hand-made walking sticks and pans that the designer made himself.

Morels is a mediocre game that looks beautiful.  It does not add anything or does anything better than many other similar games.  It looks charming, but under looks is a game of card counting, playing the odds, and random draws.  I would only play it if nothing better was offered, it's a nice game but there are other games that give me more.

I keep thinking, "maybe with more players...".

My biggest problem is the pace. Thematically, it wants to play slow; mechanically it just doesn't go that way. I really can't get myself to invest in thinking deeply with this one. The upkeep (replacing cards at the end of the 'trail'and moving the 'feet' selection card) doesn't keep pace with the player actions, throwing the pacing, and frankly becoming easily disorganized. 

Buuuut... It is pretty mushroom art :/

Using your whole turn to just place a pan is not fun. We have been experimenting with some house rules here, including a draw 1 play 1 system. Might also try all the resource cards shuffled in a separate pile with night mushrooms AND the poison mushrooms and see how that plays.

This comment is after 1 play (which I didn't enjoy much)

The game feels very mechanical. Not only the moving of the cards is annoying, but every move you make is very repetitive . Taking a card, Putting a pan down, selling 2 cards for sticks (which we didn't do much), aren't very exciting actions. The one action that does matter, cooking the mushrooms, it a very solitary action that goes by unnoticed by the other player. 

It feels like you are making very small steps towards your goal. And these steps are so small, that they make the game much longer than it should be.

The cards look great though. Very nice (autumn) color palet. 

Minus: 1 - 3 - 5 - 8 (too mechanical) - 10

A unique theme, and a fairly original game of set collection. The lovely illustrations hide some tense decisions (hand size is a constant thorn in your side) and a couple of ways to mess with your opponent's plans. Keeping pans (needed to score the collected mushrooms) from his grasp, for example, can stall him for quite a while and really makes the hand limit hurt.

This comparatively high level of interaction might give Morels the longetivity that such light card games often lack, but I have not played enough to really ascertain this.

This game really surprised me with its depth. The hand/table management required makes this game much more complicated than it looks. It's a quick, highly strategy dependent game that is extremely satisfying to play well. DEFINITELY learn and use the alternate setup (circular) to minimize card shifting. Otherwise, the constant moving of cards gets tiring fast.

Ok you call it Morels I call it Fungi. What could be better than a gentle stroll through the forest picking mushrooms. Nothing right? Only when it is a battle to fry up the best mushrooms and a race to get to them .. and then chuck in some butter (and no, not as in THAT film, your not Marlon Brando!) and cider and you are bound to have a good time.

This a great two player game. Love playing it over a cup of coffee. It's relaxed, and at the same time as complicated as you want it to be, and most of all fun.

I will say the Pegasus Spiele version has slightly too busy artwork. Sometimes my eyes are too relaxed and have difficulty spotting the different types of mushrooms along the forest path.

Also make your path through the forest into a circle otherwise you will get tennis elbow with the constant sliding of cards.

Good game. Keeper.

Beautiful, fun, smooth playing game. What makes this stand out as a set collection game, in my opinion, is paying sticks to reach a later card, the decay where cards go if they aren't chosen, and the poisonous cards that you don't want to take.

Very solid 2p game about collecting and cooking mushrooms.  Looking forward to the expansion.  Only issue I have with the game is the card quality.  The cards are prone to creasing.  Not once, but twice has this happened.  The first time it was my son getting a hold of the cards.  The 2nd time, my wife went to shuffle them poker-style and creased a card in the process.

Holy smokes, this game! It's everything I hoped and more.

The artwork is among my favorite of any game I've played. It's beautiful and detailed without distracting from the mechanical information involved, and it conveys the relaxing, "just chuffing about, picking mushrooms and cooking them up" vibe that suffuses the game.

And the game itself is tight, surprising, and delightful in every way. There are so many things to consider, but the option set each turn is small enough to keep the game moving briskly along. Do I grab a morel, even though I likely won't get a cooking set of them? Should I max out my hand by taking the decay, or play it safe? Should I sell these for sticks instead of working towards cooking them? Every aspect of the game is part of a web of decisions and choices.

Some turns don't offer a difficult choice, but those turns are part of a larger "set" of difficult choices. The hand management is brutal, and the deck cycles so quickly that everything you do matters.

The rules are clear and easy to learn and teach; they clicked for us partway through our first game, and we were making sharper choices in our second game. It's a breeze.

In my second game, I spent roughly the first half doing essentially nothing. I thought there was no way to recover, but a couple lucky pulls from the night deck, and some good hedging of my bets, and I managed to win by 4 points.

Morels clicked perfectly for my wife, too. She doesn't get excited about seeing more of all of the games we play, but she loves this one.

I can see this rising to a 10.

Wow! This might be my new favorite 2 player. It's definitely a great game to play with your spouse. Our other favorite 2 player is Balloon Cup, but I think this is just a better game all around. It is more strategic, offers more interesting choices, and is decidedly more thematic. Morels is an incredible game!

Update 8/23/15:

My wife and I played Morels again last night. I hadn't played this game in at least 18 months. I almost forgot how much I enjoyed it. It's such a cool little game. The only thing I don't like about it (and it is quite annoying), is that you are constantly shifting cards down the main row during the game. Every turn! That aside, it's one of the best 2-player-only games in our collection. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Super fun, cute game.  Set collection where you need to really manage your hand.  Maxing out your hand size can be crippling.  Do I take that mushroom to get a bigger set or just fry these and start a new one.  So many tough quick decisions.  Love it!

I honestly can't say enough about this game. It just hits the sweet spot for my wife and me. It has more options than Jaipur and carries more fun than Jambo with less chaos and clunkiness that the Jambo cards do.

Really a great two-player set collection game and the artwork is fantastic.

Agonizingly tough decisions makes this game tougher than it looks at a glance.  With its mix of lots of skill and just the right amount of luck thrown in to make things interesting while still being light enough to hold a conversation during play, this has shot to the top of our light 2p games list.  As with all games time will tell if it stays there, but it certainly has all the ingredients to do just that.  Its 30 minutes or so playtime means it will hit the table more often than heavier games too.  Outstanding light game that should be in every 2p group's collection.

I was quite disappointed in this after the first play. Everybody seems to like it, but it did nothing for us. Big part of it was the card design (German version 'Fungi'). Holding them in hand, it's impossible to discern which Fungus is on it. All you see is borders. Really, would it have killed them to at least add some icons to the upper left corners? As it is, you constantly shuffle your cards around, lest you want to play a game of Memory. Add to that the 'conveyor belt' mechanic of the table cards, and it gets much too flimsy. Also, strange choice of Fungi, if I dare say so. There was a plethora of nice mushrooms to choose from, why do so many of them have to grow on a tree trunk? We will give this game another chance, but if that one doesn't go over significantly better, it will be traded away.

Traded away in Nov. '14 math trade.

I haven't taken a Destroying Angel into my hand yet but can see that there may be times when it would be worthwhile:it poisons your hand one turn plus the number of meals you've cooked.

For a set collection card game this is pretty good. I like the theme of collection and cooking mushrooms, very original. The hand limit makes taking cards a real decision since it is hard to get rid of cards. The card row works nice too, especially the decay pile is interesting. It is a surprising tight game. Paying attention to your opponent is key. The walking sticks can give a pretty huge advantage as long as your opponent had none. Interesting game, but after four plays I had seen enough. In the end it didn't bring enough new things to keep it aroundd, but solid game none the less.

I wouldn't say it's better than LOST CITIES, JAMBO, JAIPUR, or any of the other two player card game classics. But it surely deserves to be ranked with them. Bottom line...clever, light, thoughtful, and lots of fun!

Puntos fuertes: Un arte muy cuidado, ilustraciones realistas, una mecánica interesante. Fácil de aprender. Independiente del idioma.
Puntos débiles: El único punto débil que le vemos es el mercado. Sin duda la parte más fastidiosa de este juego. Se mueve constantemente en cada turno y tienes que desplazar 8 cartas todo el rato. Aunque solo son cartas, requiere una superficie bastante amplia.

Conclusión: Este juego engaña. Compras una caja preciosa con setitas de colores en una cesta y crees que va a ser un juego facilón, o incluso un filler. NADA MÁS LEJOS DE LA REALIDAD. 
Es un juego sesudo, de estrategia, que te hará medir cada movimiento. No basta con coger buenas combinaciones, tienes que terminar tu jugada cocinando las setas y estar atento a lo que coge el contrario para no quedarte con setas chungas. Las partidas duran entorno 40 minutos o algo más. Entretenido y diferente. Juego exclusivamente de 2 jugadores.

An excellent 2p game. The first time I played it, I couldn't believe how fast it went. Subsequent plays have shown that slow and steady often wins the race, but there are so many tough decisions to make no matter what. You have to juggle your hand size, what cards you want, what cards you can take, and looking ahead to what your opponent does as well as the decay pile. The theme could have literally been anything else, and as it is, it keeps Morels from being something I want to play all the time. However, mechanically-speaking, this is on the level of other awesome 2p games like Sun Tzu and 7 Wonders: Duel.

The rules are straight forward and can be learned during the first game session.  The artwork for the cards is truly awesome.  I recommend it.

Little game which my wife loves to play because of the theme. Mechanics of mushrooms and other things coming and going as in the conveyor belt is full of interesting decisions. Never you have enough time to do and get everything you want (which is cool).

The cards are little thin in our international version with Latin, but you can't beat the price.

Really nice light 2-p card game. Forest upkeep is the only minus - even with the circular forest it takes a bit of work.
Edit: Upped to 8 since it's still interesting after 16 plays. Taught it to a 7-year old.

Jeu similaire à Sobek mais calibré pour 2 joueurs. Collections de champignons, soit ramasser une des 2 premie`res cartes de la foret ou payer en baton de marche pour récuperer des cartes plus loin. On peut aussi récupérer des cartes dans la défausse (max4) cuire avec du beurre ou cidre. Les paniers sont très très forts et indispensables. Les champignons mortels sont gérables. Une bonne durée avec intercation entre les joueurs.

Beautiful artwork! Also a fun game, though it bugs me that I have to re-read the rules for the Destroying Angel every single time I play (and tend to avoid picking it up, not so much because of its detrimental effects, but because I just can't be bothered working out what happens): it's the one clunky element in an otherwise well-designed game.

This game feels like a 2 player Kosmos game, but it's not. Out of all the games I've played in that series (10+ at time of writing), this one tops them hands down. It's thematic, has interesting decisions, and takes no longer than an hour.

This game is a bit boring. Moving cards after your turn takes more time than taking your turn. The gameplay is rather simplistic. There is no direct player interaction and the indirect interaction is basically just "taking cards the other guy might need". The rest is card counting.

A cool 2 player game in the vein of Kosmos 2 player releases.  In this game you are trying to set-collect different mushrooms and either sell them for walking sticks (used to pick up far away shrooms) or cook them for points.  There are a few different point modifier cards in the mix as well.

The idea is your opponent and you are walking down through the forest trail looking for mushrooms, and the mechanic that shows this (moving the cards along every turn) fits quite well, although you are constantly shifting cards non-stop, it is only a minor-irritant.  You can pick up the group of spoiling cards, 1-4 cards, or choose to pick one up from the trail in the 1 or 2 spot.  If you want a shroom farther down the line it costs you one walking stick per space farther away from the 2 spot.

The game is essentially a clever and quick set-collecting game with an awesome theme that brings everything together very enjoyably.  With a game taking 20 minutes you are almost always tempted to get one more game in.

Just so/so on this one. My wife enjoys it though, which is a plus for it, so that is why I purchased it. I think the graphic design could've been a bit better and I think I'll just shuffle the night cards in with the regular cards instead of separating them out every time. I don't know. I just feel like it is missing something to be on the caliber of Jaipur or Traders of Carthage as a two-player game.

A quick two-player set collection card game. Nothing especially memorable here but the size and price of the Pegasus edition make this easy to try out. 

The rulebook structure and wording is amazingly confusing regarding the turn sequence (especially the removal of the 'oldest' card) but once you get that sorted out, it all flows smoothly. The Pegasus edition obfuscates this even further by having a critical error on the English rules.

Pleasingly-paced and -themed game of timing and push-your-luck, marred a little by fussy administration (you absolutely MUST use the alternative layout suggested in the rules if you don't to go crazy) and a suggestion that some games might be virtually over by halfway down the deck. Sweet art and presentation that doesn't quite carry over to the fussy rulebook. As a cosy couples' game, it's easily as good as any of the alternatives.

2 player game. Didn't really get into it so far, maybe have to play it again. 
It just seems too similar to Jaipur (collecting sets that are differently common and selling them, a cardtype to help you collect cards that you could normally not take (yet), handcard limit, bonuses for bigger sets) but then is somehow missing to me mainly the pressure of having to sell your stuff before the other player does, because of limited points available. 
I can see that some people might actually prefer not having that part of the other player messing with your scoring so much. So Fungi is in that sense maybe a little more laid back and then has some more strategic decisions for increasing your card limit. 

Although I really like the artwork overall, when holding the cards they are actually not always easy to distinguish (maybe some symbols in the upper corner would be nice) Also managing the cards is getting a little annoying even in the circular setup.

An interesting Rummy variant where you are trying to meld sets down to your tableau. Low levelin strategy, yet interesting decisions to be made throughout. The complaint about constant fiddling with the card row is legit but not enough for me to write this one off. A neat little filler of a game that the lighter game fans of the house (read: "wife" here) will take to.

Update: After repeated plays increased rating. Fun game that stands up to repeated play.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]This was one of our first games and my wife and kids still love playing this game a 3 years later. (Even after my wife spilled coffee on the cards.) I had the opportunity to play the new Fungi version and while I like the new artwork, I still prefer the original version's artwork. This is still one of my favorite 2p card games and one I highly recommend.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8.5):[/COLOR]

[i]- Excellent cafe game, this game has a small footprint.
- Great theme and beautiful artwork; I especially appreciate the different art found on the night time cards.
- May be the best had management game I own, the limit on hand size combined with that fact that you can not just discard cards creates a nice amount of tension in the game.
- Brent (the designer) is extremely helpful and supports the people that play his game. 
I have had two separate issues and he has generously sent me replacement cards!

This is one of my wife's favorite games and it is probably my favorite 2p card game to play with her. I was also lucky enough to get the actual frying pans and wooden sticks, they look awesome.[/i]

Great theme on this game, the idea that you are walking through the forest described by a moving line of cards is quite poetic. The mechanics of constantly shifting those cards is tiring, and we only played it once so i am sure we be better able to valuate which thing on the line is most important and when. Baskets are good, pans are common. Etc. Update the circle setup while lessening the thematic appeal makes the cycle of cards better. This is an ok game, its so hard to get a two player game right, I still think Jaipur might do it the best.

What A Find!!!! Fun, Fresh, Beautiful!! 2 player set-collection hand-management card game about mushroom foraging in the forest. This'll be a timeless keeper for me and my wife. BTW, she kicks my butt often at this game.

Gameplay can get ruthless when you start collecting 'shrooms the other player is looking for! Timing is key; do you forage, do you sell one of your collections for sticks, or do you cook it up for points? Quality artwork! Physically and play-wise, Morels is of Kosmos caliber. We still enjoy the original rules for the Death Angel, but we play with the circular "forest".

Reminds me a little of Monopoly Deal and Jaipus, BUT CERTAINLY STANDS OUT ON IT'S OWN.

Beautiful game, unique concept, and great artwork. There is nothing in the rules about the penalty for when players accidentally find themselves with too many cards in their hand, but otherwise the rules are written well and leave no room for confusion, and there are even some alternate rules included. The cards are far too difficult to shuffle, though, and already two or three of them have been damaged. My favorite game that I've played. Wish I could find more games like this.

After an initial positive impact, after a few only plays I felt that this game does not have a lot of replay value. I will give it a few more goes but I already feel that this feels a lot like a "sit and wait" type of game. Not nearly as good as Jaipur (it's most obvious comparison).

Haven't played it yet enough to rate it but I have to say sth about the quality of the components of the Pegasus Fungi edition (I never saw the Morels edition).

In photographs I was amazed by the artwork but when I got my copy I found the cards to be flimsy and "uninteresting" to touch. 

The fist thing that came to mind was my Incan gold Gryphon edition where I hated the artwork immensely but when I touched and seen the cards I was very impressed! Fungi gave me the complete opposite feeling. 

Hope the game proves to be great but for me looks and feel are major parts of enjoying a board game.

Even the box of the game managed to disappoint me.

I had heard that this game for many fired Jambo AND Jaipur.  Well, for me, it's not as good as either of those games.  The turns are very quick and so the constant pushing of cards along the forest from the deck and management of the decay pile is just overwhelming for such a quick game that it detracts from the enjoyment of play.  I would much rather play Jaipur.

This is a relaxing 2-player set collection game.  There are a number of mushroom and utility cards that can be drafted; creating smaller sets of mushrooms allows you to get "sticks" which help you draft further along the line, while creating larger sets will score points.  The game ends when the deck is exhausted--making it particularly important to count cards to know how big you can make your sets.  A reference card showing you the distribution in the deck helps somewhat, but you really need to remember what's gone by.  Despite having a decent amount of rules overhead, the negative card was very easy to avoid.

What a beautiful little set collection game. We have played this so much. Very very rarely, luck will go out of bounds leading to an unbalanced game, but 19 out of 20 games will be well balanced and a blast. Don't make the mistake of getting more than two baskets to increase your hand size, it'll just make you greedy and clog your deck and you'll end the game with a handful of cards and nothing scored. It's all about balance and knowing when to wait and when to pull the trigger. Tons of fun.

This is an excellent two player card game that is far more strategic than one would at first expect. Each turn, you are confronted with a number of tough decisions. Grab the card that benefits you or the one that your opponent needs? Forgo a new card to sell the mushrooms in your hand? Or maybe fry up a fresh batch? But if you do that, the Destroying Angel will keep you from getting the card you want in the Decay Pile! Aaaugh! A truly delightful romp through the forest, picking 'shrooms, and frying them for dinner.

This is a very cute set collection game for 2 players. The theme is you gather mushrooms and when you have enough, you can either sell them, which lets you gather cards from further down the faceup purchase line, or if you have a pan card, you can cook them, which essentially just means you score them. It's complex enough that it held my attention and I'd be happy to play it again, which sets it above many of the other light 2 player games I've played recently.

Morels is a step-up from Jaipur in 2P games that uses hand management / set collection mechanics. The aim is to collect and cook mushrooms during a "walk in the forest". Morels has more strategy to it than Jaipur and while there is luck too, in terms of the order in which cards come onto the forest path, one can anticipate and collect foraging sticks so as to gain more control on the card collection sequence.

I'd place Morels between Jaipur and Targi in 2P games. It fits the bill when you want something that isn't as much of autopilot as a Jaipur but you don't have the time or inclination for something as deep as Targi.

I like how the mechanics match the theme, and the art is quite nice. The game can be almost soothing (unless you're looking for that last freaking fairy ring!). The act of moving the cards after each turn can get a bit old, but we could always try the alternate forest arrangement. I enjoy the press your luck element. Morels doesn't see a ton of play, but I'm glad it's in our collection.

Played three times. The third time we had to force ourselves to play it in the hopes of learning to like it.

It's a quick game, but cumbersome. The game is fiddly, and it seems to require one person be the "banker" to keep things ordered. It took us three plays to get all the rules right and we found ourselves referencing the rules quite a bit in our first two plays.

* Cards have to slide after every turn (we've figured out ways to avoid most of this), which breaks the flow of an otherwise quick moving game.
* It is absolutely necessary to count cards. Jaipur handled this better by having the point stacks show you how many of something was left.
* Speaking of counting cards, you'll find yourself needing to count how many cards you have in your hand far too often. Hand limits are common in games, but in this game your hand limit changes and can get pretty high.
* It's way too easy to get junk in your hand and way too hard to get it back out, so taking a card to keep the other player from getting it can hurt you more than the other person. If you can't mess with the other person, the game just becomes a race to get the most points.
* Where going for Leather in Jaipur could often be a good strategy, going for low value cards in Morels never felt worthwhile. Sure, five Honey Fungus and a Cider can get you 10 points, but three Porcini can get you to 9 in half the turns and if you're trying to collect those six cards, you probably don't have much room in your hand to mess with your opponent.
* We like luck in our games, but the difficulty of getting crud out of your hands makes the risk of picking up random night cards a bit much. If you pick up something you're already collecting, it can be a huge point swing. If you pick up something else, I suppose you can at least get some walking sticks when you waste a turn to dump it.

We haven't tried any strategies involving intentionally taking Destroying Angels yet. Their effects get worse the further you get into the game, which is also when you might have the most junk in your hand you want to get rid of. Clearing that junk out could give you some advantages, but it might take three or four turns before you can benefit from it.

I don't dislike Morels, but it's a frustrating and cumbersome game and I'd MUCH rather play Jaipur or Traders of Carthage.

Oh, I'd also rather play 500 Rummy. Similar feel, better game.

It is very hard to understand the decay mechanic and how it affects what is available to a player without playing at least 3/4 of a game to see it work.

RATING: 5
Tried it several times and it didn't thrill us. A rather dull game with a lot of card manipulation. And because the choices are often obvious, you're mainly moving the cards around instead of playing. For such a simple affair, it's hell of a fiddly game!

About the game itself: try it only if you enjoy set collection. Like with many card games, it's very random, though there are some mechanics to alleviate that issue (mainly the sticks that let you collect mushrooms farther away in the woods). But in the end we always felt like it was 15-20 minutes of our time lost. There are so, SO many better quick 2p games!

RATING: 6
I had been on the look out for Morels for ages so it came as something of a shock to discover that Fungi was the same game and readily available in UK stores.

Although the game is good, after such anticipation it ended up being a bit of a disappointment. Maintaining the card display is a bit of a drag (the alternative layout in the rulebook helps) but the set collection mechanic is just a bit too vanilla for my tastes. There are some interest decisions but the game just isn't that exciting.

Some call it light, but my wife and I really like this set-collection game about mushroom foraging a lot.  Being able to sell two or more like cards for foraging sticks (that help you break the rules and get cards faster than others) instead of only cooking them up for points is nice.  It does seem like in some of my plays the sticks do not really get used much, or that the people that use them lose more frequently.   Perhaps that is simply because we're still newer to the game.  Easy to learn but with a nice depth that seems to grow a bit after repeated plays.  Highly recommended.

People describe this as a lovely stroll through the forest, but I have a tendency to count cards, so for me I found myself getting very anxious about the number or certain mushrooms left in the deck and watching the rummage pile clear at all the wrong moments. I a, sure this will get better with repeated plays. I definitely acknowledge how original and interesting the game mechanics can be. Will probably raise the rating with future plays.

I rate Morels high for it's beauty and simplicity. A great game for two, with a pleasant theme and plenty of choices. Mushroom or the basket? Moon or the pan? Let this card slide to the decay and hope your opponent doesn't collect the lot? Cook now, or hold out for that shiitake that you just KNOW is hiding out in the draw deck?

And sometimes it's just heartbreaking to see that decay pile wiped away to the discard.

Really fun 2 player game. I enjoy the different situations/decisions that come up each game. You really need to look at what cards are down the trail and plan your plays accordingly. At the same time, better keep an eye on the cards your opponent is collecting and think about taking those cards to deny extra points. 

Buying walking sticks might seem like a waste, but if your opponent has sticks and you don't they have the power to determine which of the top cards get within your reach.

It's a straight forward game, but the hand limit and constantly rolling trail/decay lead to tough choices.

Charming game, beautiful to look at. Has that "once more" quality that defines the best lighter games. I'd say that this is a near perfect couples game; it's not complicated & has just the right amount of screwage. And the sticks are fun to fidget with:)

My goodness, this game is beautiful.  A quick two player game by new designer, Brent Povis, this is a real find.  Basic premise is walking through the woods foraging for mushrooms which you can then cook for victory points.  Butter and cider can add to scores but you will need pans to cook and learn how to deal with the Destroying Angel.  Only the one play so far but the number of difficult decisions I had to make - caused chiefly by the low hand limit - meant that this was a real brain burner, considering the relatively simple mechanics.

(+) Night cards add a welcome piece of intrigue to delve into should you seek a boost in your mushroom value.  

(-) Can devolve into hoarding specific mushrooms.

You could do a lot worse than this quick little innocuous card game. There' nothing terribly innovative, but theme wise it strays well away from all the space, trading and fantasy themed games. Here you're transported to a world of mushroom collecting and cooking. I've seen much bigger stretches with the theme of a game, but my opponents by a large just don't find mushroom collecting and cooking terribly engrossing. That said, nobody has complained about it either.

There's a few choices to be made each turn with future investments, timing of cooking and picking, not leaving yourself short of certain cards, etc. Each turn there's always more than one thing you'd like to do, so therein lies the angst and difficult choices. Sure, you can get unlucky or lucky with the card draw, but it only happens with the high value mushrooms and those are the risks.

Not a bad way to spend 20 minutes and is a lot less fiddly if you follow the Pegasus edition's alternative card layout.

There's something captivating, for me, about this theme: the casual atmosphere of a hike in the woods, foraging ahead with your walking stick and collecting mushrooms in your wicker baskets; the idea of cooking those same mushrooms out in the woods using a heavy pan set over a small, smoking bonfire with some butter or cider, or both; it's just pleasant. But, on top of that, there are meaningful and occasionally quite tough decisions to be made, timing to be planned for, and exquisite tension in the wait to see whether your opponent will take that one card you really don't want them to have. I think it's a wonderful, dare I say delectable, game.

Took a chance and bought this game directly from the designer on the assumption that it would get a lot of gameplay for the money.  I wasn't wrong.  We've played several times, and we are still figuring out the best strategies.  Perfect game to play while waiting for daughter to finish eating her dinner.  Liked it more when we switched to a circular layout (eliminating the need to slide cards all the time).

Someday I'd like to have a Kallax dedicated solely to "Games For People With Good Souls". This is where all of the charmers like Morels would rest, waiting for players who delight in walks in the woods, foraging for nature's gifts, maybe letting a little calculating side-eye overcome them once in awhile as they let lust for a beautiful mushroom overtake their hearts. Morels is a gentle, easy game, and I will forever regret not getting the actual little fungus-frying pans offered with the early copies. (I did buy some black Sculpey, but 7th grade Art did not prepare me to replicate anything other than asymmetrical pinch pots.)

[Pegasus Spiele Fungi 2014 Edition] {Forest; card-drafting, set-collection; 2p} Fungi is in the same genre of Balloon Cup / Lost Cities.  Players compete to collect mushrooms in the display to get higher score.  The starting hand limit is 8 cards, too!

In this game, sticks is the currency for a player to select better cards down the display.  So, maintaining a balance of sticks and score is essential: 3+ mushrooms of a type can be sold for scores, 2+ mushrooms of a type can be sold for sticks.

Luck of draw is not very critical in this game.  It allows tactical decisions & planning.   The decay pile is a good one for getting cards to exchange for resources.

The tension is good in this game.  Player interaction is strong; esp. in getting Pans.  Good.

I like the illustration of mushrooms.

My most frequent playing partners are my wife, 10 year old son and 5 year old daughter.  I have a lot of games but not that many that they all like.  Morels is one of these games. 

It's easy to teach and quick to play.  It has options and tough choices.  Probably my favorite two player game to play with my wife.

I also was able to get the hand crafted parts from the designer.  I was really impressed with the designer...very friendly.  Makes me want to support his game even more.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Small set collection game with some added twists built in by using hand-size (red mushrooms, basket), tactical collection (sticks), bonus cards (night cards) and delayed scoring (pans). All in all, the space to choose your action from is just right: small enough to quickly grasp the possibilities, big enough to have a meaningful choice. As in many set collection games, you have to pay attention what your opponent is doing, and while there is no direct interaction between players, there is the 'grabbing the right set' vs 'making sure the opponent does not get his set' vs 'setting myself up for a bigger set/possibilities in the future' choice which makes each turn enjoyable.

This game is a bit light for my taste, but it is a game that will really go down well when played with my (non-gamer) spouse while I still enjoy playing. There are not many other games in this genre (competitive enjoyable 2p cardgames without direct interaction) that accomplish this (Jaipur being my only exception) so this game is highly recommended if you want to try something else without putting a coop down.

Morels is fun, mostly because the theme comes through so wonderfully.  The art, the names of the mushrooms and the game play terminology is really adorable. 

I find the play to be engaging but curious.  Sometimes at the end of the game I am stuck with a hand of crap and my opponent as well.  We can't match anything and we just call it.  A strange way for a game to end.  I am hoping with more plays we will discover that we can snatch everything up till the last card.  The use of sticks is something that we need to use more of and I am sure that is the key.  I like the Destroying Angels as a way of thinning your hand if timed correctly.

I wish I had an automatic card conveyor belt to layout the cards.  Not too bad but mildly fiddly.  I can deal with it.  Overall, a fun, good looking game for two.

update : getting better at being more efficient for the endgame.  Now it's just a matter of the damn timing of things!

Sort of a bizarre theme, but it comes through well enough in the mechanics (walking down a path to pick mushrooms to fry up).

(But, not terribly interested in trying it again, so likely will never know.)

Nice light-weight game for 2 players that serves well as a filler or is perfect for gamenights with less time on hand. A little bit of Push-your-luck paired with decision-making, what's not to like? Only minor letdown for me would be the question why you are finding pans in the forest instead of buying them but this way it probably works best mechanically .

This is the first small 2-player game in my 25+ years of gaming that I would rate at a 10/10. It's easy to pick up and play but the tactics can be quite subtle and pleasingly tense.

If you like a tactical game with wonderful art, & a novel theme, that plays in under 30 minutes, this is a sure-fire hit. It's got set-collection, variable costs to balance, important decisions to make every turn, subtle but meaningful interaction between players, and always leaves you wanting to do more than you can on any turn. Fun and rewarding play from a talented indy designer. Enjoy.

Proof positive that good things come in small packages.  On second thought,  I recant.  Good is a colossal misnomer - this game forays into that all too rare great territory.

This is a brilliant design with stunning artwork that is relaxing, fresh and beautiful to look at.  For a simple game, it boasts a mix of mechanics that are unlike any I have encountered before and game play that is so addictive,  the game manual should include a hotline for those that are undoubtedly going to need help.

In case you haven't surmised it already - this is my favorite 2 player card game.  It inexplicably transcends the sum of its parts like no other before it.

If you game with two - do not pass this one by.

This two player set collection game is simply delightful.  I love the theme... hiking in the woods, collecting and cooking mushrooms.  The game is beautiful, especially the night cards.  Play is competitive and strategic despite being a fairly quick game.

I have only two nits about the game.  First, it requires constant sliding, although there is a variant layout pattern that might minimize that.  Second, the cards are hard to identify when held as a hand.

RATING: 7.5
[thing=122298][/thing] is a set collection game with some complications thrown in, like demanding pans to cook mushrooms, baskets to carry more things, additions to spice the food (butter and cider), decaying and night mushrooms. Yet, in its heart, is a standard set collection: managing the cards in order to obtain the maximum from them.

Thus, one takes mushrooms to form sets of at least 3 of the same kind in order to be able to cook them and, with this, earn points at the end of the game - the more mushrooms cooked, bigger the score. To cook is necessary pans - players start with one, but more are required, as each one can be used just one time. Then, to form bigger sets, one needs more room in the hand, which is what baskets do - they raise the hand limit by 2 cards. Is also possible to add butter (4+) or cider (5+) to big sets in order to make them worth more (3 and 5 additional points, respectively) - the problem is, of course, to be able to take and hold the high number of cards. Along side this, players try to grab the night mushrooms, which are worth for 2 of the normal types, but is possible to take cards with little use to yourself, that will do more harm than good, by clogging the hand of cards. Is also possible to sell 2 of the same kind of mushroom to gain sticks, which can be used to take cards further away. Finally, a player can take all the decaying cards (one, per turn, goes into decaying - up to 4 card be there). There is a good deal of options for the player.

On each round the player makes 1 action of 5 possible ones: taking one card, taking all the decaying cards (if she has room for all of them in her hand), puting down a pan, selling mushrooms for sticks, or cooking. Is mandatory to make an action if the person can make one, which means thay is possible to be obligated to sell mushrooms, wanting or not. And is likely to have to pass on a good card since the player is already at the limit in the hand, requiring the player to cook sooner than she would want, just to open some room for new cards.

Thus, [thing=122298][/thing] has a lot of planning, as players can see with 3 to 4 rounds in advance what cards will be available, hand management and search for the best opportunities. It works pretty well for 2, since the players have more control, allowing them to even manipulate the availability of cards, be to make sure that one will be up for them to grab, or to prevent the other from taking a particular one.

Though it is a 2 players game, [thing=122298][/thing] ins't truly agressive, as the hand limit hinders the chances of someone playing too mean, taking what the other wants, unless it also helps the person doing the blocking, otherwise the player will have her back on the wall quickly. 

The flow of the play is lively, as turns go fast, since each player do just one action at a time, and a whole game will last around 20 minutes. There is some dose of luck in the game (basically in the night mushrooms), but good planning, decisions and timming will decide the winner.

Overall, [thing=122298][/thing] is a fine 2 players game, with an easy and relaxed gameplay, filled with a good amount of choices in a short playing time. Recommended.

Nice 2 player set collection game based around foraging for mushrooms. 

Has some rough edges design-wise: the death angel rules seem overworked for a card which is seldom played (edit: these have been improved in the new version). The moon cards are almost always a no-brainer. The "conveyor belt" setup as written doesn't work well and needs a variant to cut down the admin.

That you have to slide cards along the centre row after almost every turn might not sound like the greatest failing a game has ever had. However, my defining memory of this game is the interminable sliding it involved.

Thankfully there is no nasty 'take that'. Instead, as someone else has commented, you can be a bit sneaky  which makes this a great couples game.

On my first play through I thought the game rather pedestrian but from the second play belatedly realised possible strategies. I'm still being beaten on a regular basis but one day.....!

Sliding the display along really adds to your sense of walking through the forest.....oh lord, sometimes I think I value theme too much!

Sliding the card row was annoying the first couple of times, but now it's just part of the routine. This game reminds me a lot of Lost Cities - the mechanics are quite different, but the tension of 'should I begin collecting a new set or is there not enough time?' definitely comes from the same place. Morels gets better the more I play it, and even though all the cards in the deck will come out every time, the order in which they appear can make a huge difference in the strategy and feel of the game.

It's a bit frustrating of a design because it feels like it could have been so much more -- the theme is nice, it promises a fair amount of complexity with its different mushrooms, and it builds itself up to have a lot of cases (should I take storage space or take the 3rd porcini so I can cook?)

Problem is, though, in the end, the game plays itself out more often than not (storage space beats these three worthless mushrooms, there's rarely a need to pick up a Destroying Angel, etc.). It's sort of an in-between weight, trying to be heavier than it needs to be.

There's nonstop, agonizing decisions you have to make every turn.

Deeply relaxing and enjoyable. Somehow manages to conjure the feel of an autumn stroll through the forest. Some luck of the draw, but I suspect superior play will win out on average.

I'm a sucker for cool components, so when I heard that the special version with real frying pans and wooden sticks was being sold at BGG.con, I had to go there first thing and buy a copy.

The game is enjoyable. It didn't knock my socks off, but it's a fun 2 player game. There's definitely a memory element in remembering which mushrooms have been discarded, so shouldn't be pursued any more for points, and should be traded for cash. Not a strong suit for me.

If there was a complaint, it's that it is fiddly. You take a card, then have to slide 6 or 7 other cards down on the table, since you fill in cards from the opposite end. So every turn it's "take card, slide slide slide slide slide slide slide, refill, your turn".

On our most recent play, we tried a marker instead of moving cards. Arrange the 8 cards in a circle or square, and place a pawn that represents the front of the line where you may choose cards. After taking or decaying a card, move the marker clockwise to the first available card, and refill the hole from the deck. Works much much better.

RATING: 7.5
An intriguing, light card game involving gathering delicious mushrooms in the forest (and some toxic ones, too?). I enjoy the attention to detail in the artwork and the opportunities to out-think your opponent, but this game doesn't tick quite enough boxes for me to consider it a top choice among our light games.

My wife and I play a lot of games together and we have both been fascinated by the theme of this gem. Moreover, she prefers a little less player interaction than I do and the balance of interaction and playing your own game looks to be just right for us in this one.

Mushrooms...yum!

Ok... Nothing special. Nice cards, a bit meh, a keeper definitely but I wouldn't go out of your way for it.

RATING: 8.2
Often described as the perfect husband and wife game, which could not be more spot on. It moves pleasantly quickly and has the right luck to skill ratio. The theme is non-offensive and player interactions are only indirect.

The basic mechanic of cards moving down a ladder to become cheaper and cheaper is common to many games, but here it is done especially well. Most turns two cards move at once which makes things speedier, and cards at the bottom of the ladder get collected and can be picked up in bulk, which adds a strategic element. A special card in the set "poisons" the bulk collection, which adds just the right amount of complexity. A well rounded filler for two.

Rating may change but currently really enjoying this as a 'couples' game. Doesn't take long, looks simple, fairly easy to learn but feels like quite a lot going on. The decay system creates some interesting choices and keeps the pace ticking along.

Interesting mechanics, but there were a lot of times both my opponent and I ended up picking up cards that weren't going to be useful (too many of the same type of mushroom had already gone into the discard) for cooking OR selling.  Without a fallback "discard a card" option, this really bogged down our hands throughout the game.  The next time we play, I'll also try house ruling that any Destroying Angels in your initial hand go back to the deck.

This was apparently the biggest thing to come out of Origins 2012. I'm not quite sure why it made such big waves, as it's little more than Bohnanza with the trading phase removed. Granted, Morels is strictly a two player affair, so trading would be hard to pull off, but it's still weird to me that they would try to emulate a game and then remove it's most interesting part.

The rules are simple enough. Player's collect cards as they move down a path, similar to Through the Ages or The Manhattan Project, paying extra currency to choose cards that are new to the board and paying less for cards as they move closer to the end of the line. Players try to collect sets of 3-5 cards and then play them to score. 

I wasn't nearly as taken with it as everyone else seems to be. I was also kind of annoyed by having to constantly refill the card track after every selection, not to mention discarding the trash pile every other turn. There is little to no down time between a player's turns, so you are absolutely churning through those cards and constantly fiddling with them gets very tedious.

It's very quick and there is little to agonize over on any particular turn, so it does work well as a filler game. The kids seemed to enjoy it quite a bit as well, so it's possible that I am just jaded by having played too many games of this sort.

This game is easy to teach and quick to play, with beautiful art and meaningful decisions. It's affordable and very portable. The theme is calming, and it also doesn't have any direct attacks against the opponent, which is great. This is currently my favorite game, and I would play it a lot more if I had more opportunities to be in a 2-player-only situation.

My wife and I truly enjoy this game.  It is always in the game bag in our camper.  Many a night, we like to sit at the picnic table next to the camp fire, the lantern glow over our card walk down the mushroom path while enjoying a glass of wine. I'm going to fry 5 Porcinis in apple cider... delicious.

Fun little game, but I would prefer Jaipur over this.  The main gripe I had with this game was the row management where you had to constantly shift the cards to keep them on the table or in the approximate same position.  With the turns being very quick, this quickly became a headache to deal with.

Played a few rounds of this in one sitting when we broke it out for the first time. The cards move through pretty quickly when you're playing, so fast hand-management seems to be clutch for success in this two-player game. 

I've seen the game Morels in some game shops since picking this up and they seem to be the same game (possibly Morels is a licensed version?), but I prefer the artwork on this version (cards are quite beautiful given that mushrooms are the main subject matter) 

This is not a game where you can plan ahead too much as the cards wipe from the available group very quickly, so there is a fair amount of tension in deciding if you are going to act now or try to hold off until later. Being able to keep track of the cards played will help as you don't want to get stuck with cards that you won't get you any points at round's end. 

We found this to be a fairly meaty experience for quick a card game. There are enough ways to get points (in combining some of the point modifiers with the base mushroom points) that you don't feel stuck doing the same thing each time. Some might find the quickness with which cards come and go a bit frustrating but it keeps the game pace moving along nicely. Looking forward to playing more often.

Decent filler, set collection card game. It is marred by the amount of upkeep that has to happen at the end of every turn to keep the game going (moving cards around, dealing new cards out, cleaning out the discard once it hits 5+). We played it a few times, I'm not sure if I'm interested in playing it much more.

Pulled this out again after over a year and enjoyed it. Holding on to this one.

I had positive hopes for this as a set collection filler, but the upkeep is a major turn-off: sliding cards down, adding new cards, and constantly checking your hand size limit. The end game is also a bit wonky where its clear from a long way out you won't be able to cook anymore. My wife refuses to play this anymore, so away it goes.

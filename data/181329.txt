Surprisingly decent partnership game which, despite heroic language-neutral efforts to explain everything, falls flat for me on both iconography and (especially) art. I think this is a high-quality, native production away from being at least a point higher.

This is a great game for those who are unfamiliar with mechanisms found in many modern hobby games. It is quite similar to traditional card games that many casual gamers are used to. It highly emphasizes the team aspect. To do well, it helps if you are paying attention to what your partner has already picked up.

Bridge for people who don't want to learn bridge. I'm not really interested in card games that seem to take inspiration from classics but require special decks of cards to play. I guess I'd play it with a group if that's what they wanted to do as a filler between longer games but something I wouldn't go out of my way to play. There's enough you can do with a standard deck of cards.

The goal cards take longer to explain than it does to play the game.   I wonder if these could have been made a lot more clear.   There are only two colors of cards in the deck.  I find that mildly annoying.   It's probably clever and necessary, and it probably makes the card passing a LOT more interesting.   I could not help but think this was a lot like FUSE! but as a card game.   Has the feel of a mass market card game.   Happy to play again, but not really my cup of tea.

This is a great discovery from Essen 2016.   You play with a partner, so 4 or 6 players can play.  Cards are numbered and appear in one of two colours.  Each person has a task card: this may be to make a run of three, or to make 2 blue pairs, or 4 of the same number, or whatever; and there is a single task card for all players to achieve in the centre.  On your turn you draw cards from a central pool of turned up cards and, importantly, you can give two cards from your hand to your partner.  You are not allowed to communicate with your partner to say what you require.  Therefore you must keep your eye on what your partner is drawing, and attempt to work out what they need.  Similarly you watch what your opponents are drawing and attempt to draw cards from the pool to deny them the cards they might require.

The game is very easy to explain and very simple in its structure, yet it is very entertaining to play.  My largely light gaming family absolutely loved this game, and there are enough decisions in it to make it feel satisfying.   The pièce de résistance is the clever interplay between partners which gives the game a wonderfully interactive and fresh feel.

Team Play is a very easy to learn and play partnership game. The only thing that may throw people for a loop is the iconography on the goal cards. They aren't terrible, but they do take some getting used to. Additionally, it's not so bad because they are open information, rather than private. So, it's easy to help new players with the objectives. I could see some people thinking this is too simplistic, and I'd probably prefer to play Codenames as a partnership game, but this is a good alternative to use from time-to-time.

2016-12-27: Very simple game where you are not allowed to talk about what you are doing which make me kind of question the name of the game. ;-)
I guess you can get better at it when playing a lot, but this is just not the kind of game I care a lot about. I think the 'teamplay' of the game makes me care less about this than for instance 'For Sale' and 'No Thanks!' which has similar footprint/heaviness.

If you look at the game without taking the team-play aspect into account, it is almost Phase 10 level simple (and similarly dull). The team play aspect is what elevates it to a game that is worth playing at all. Whether it makes it a good game is a different matter still. Personally, I think the game is still too simple to be very interesting. A nice light team experience for when there isn't a lot of time or the socializing is more important than the gaming (which, I suppose, is all it's really wanting to be).

Light partnership game with a really bad name. The scores of the cards are line up fairly well so most people tend to end with similar scores (ie: harder goals are worth more points but need more cards; easier goals need less cards but worth less points).

It's very important to pay attention to what your partner is doing on their turn so you can pass useful cards to them.

Each player has a goal and there is a common goal. Draw two cards a turn, Ticket to Ride style, then pass up to two cards to your partner. When you meet a goal, you discard the appropriate cards to collect it. It's worth points based on difficulty, then a new goal comes out. Most points wins.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game consists of two decks - number cards and mission cards. Number cards have 8 cards of each number, half red and half blue, going up to number 8. This deck is shuffled, six card hands are dealt and a display of four cards are put up next to the draw pile. Every player is also dealt a face up mission card. Players are partnered with the player across from them. The team who has the most points when one team completes 8 missions wins. A player can draw up to two cards and complete any missions that they are able to with their hand. Missions require different combinations of sets and colors and score points according to difficulty. At the end of your turn, you can pass zero, one, or two cards to your partner, hopefully helping them to complete their face up mission.

That's all there is to it. It is a stupidly simple game, but the interaction between partners and the race quality of trying to beat out the other team makes this a good dose of simple fun you can play with non-gamers and still enjoy it yourself.

RATING: 9
This is a simple and brilliant card game. Players play on teams of 2. Each player has a public goal card which demands certain configurations of cards (e.g. three red 6's, or a 3,4,5,6 straight). There is also a single communal goal card shared by all players. There's a face up display of 3 cards to draw from. On your turn you can draw 2 cards and complete your goal (or the communal one), each goal is worth some points based on how easy it is to complete (statistically). At the end of your turn you may pass 1-2 cards to your partner. However, you are not allowed to discuss anything with your partner.

It's a light game but there are some interesting decisions that crop up. There's a little bit of depth. I am also finding I really like partnership games. [thing=146278]Tash-Kalar[/thing] with 4 players in partnership mode is awesome.

Teams of two draw cards Ticket-To-Ride-style from a central display to fulfill tasks. At the end of the turn, up to two cards can be passed on to the other player to help him fulfill his task. No communication is allowed between the players.

Team Play can be fun if played reasonably fast and with only two teams. With three teams (=6 players) it takes too long and luck of getting the right cards at the right time is too high. Too often, turns consist of drawing only hidden cards hoping for the best and then waiting too long. A '6' with four players, otherwise at best a '5'.

A perfectly cromulent partnership game. I would say that the outcome will probably be determined 60 - 70% by luck, but it's quick enough where that doesn't really matter. It seems fairly unique, but not convincing enough to make me want to play it all the time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A phenomenal team game where you're working together to essentially fulfill contracts that are worth points using a simple system of numbers and colors.  There are enough decision points here where a more skilled player will have a better chance of winning over a less-skilled player.  You really have to pay attention to what your teammate takes, plays, and gives to you because you can't speak with them about what they have or what you need.  It's cheap, portable, and so much fun.  A classic card game you should have!

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I found this partnership game fairly charming. It is important to pay attention to what your partner is collecting as you can aid in his/her goal, particularly if you find your goal difficult to achieve. Iconology is a bit confusing initially, but it becomes pretty clear fairly quickly on the goal cards. Curious to try with 5-6 players.

RATING: 9
Fun team-based card game. I enjoy Tichu for the team aspect, and this scratches the same itch. In Team Play, you are working towards completing goal cards along the lines of poker hands (e.g. 3 of a kind, 2 pairs, straight, etc.), but you can pass up to two cards to your partner at the end of your turn to assist with his/her goals as well. All goal cards are face up on the table.

Fun, light partnership game in which players will be racing to complete objective cards with simple objectives (a straight, a full house, two pair of even cards, etc...). The game works well primarily because of its partnership aspect, which only exists with 4 or 6 players. Players can't discuss their hands with their partners, but can pass one another two cards as part of their turn. This reduces the luck required to complete a mission card and enhances the tactical decisionmaking... grabbing cards your partner might want is almost as important as grabbing them for yourself. Presumably useless with 3 or 5.

This is a very clever little partnership card game filler. The rules and scoring combos are very simple to understand, and have VP rewards appropriate to difficulty. The passing rule, I think, is what makes the game especially interesting and fun. Fun!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]

The deck has red and blue cards numbered 1-8 (4 of each combo). Players get a random starting hand of 1+ cards (depends on player order), and there's a face up display of 3 cards. A separate scoring card deck is shuffled: each player gets one, and one is placed in the center. The score cards denote specific combinations of cards and a VP award. Any time a player gets a new score card, including at the start, they may discard it and replace off the top of the deck (must keep this one). 

On your turn, first discard down to 6 cards if you have more than 6. Then, you get 1-2 actions (in any order; must complete the action in full):
- MUST draw 2 cards (Ticket to Ride style)
- MAY pass 1-2 cards to your partner
In addition, if you meet the conditions of either your score card or the center score card, discard appropriate cards, bank the card, and immediately draw a new card (again, with right to refuse X 1).

The game end triggers when one team has collected 8 score cards: every player, including triggering player, gets one final turn. Most VP wins!

I liked Team Play quite a bit. There's a bit of luck in terms of which goal cards you receive (even though you can veto one each time you receive a new goal), but in the end partners who work together well to fulfill their goals will be rewarded. Simple and fun, with most of the thought/decisions/skill involved in deciding whether and what cards to pass to your partner.

I'm liking it so far but not sure if it will be a keeper.

The basic gameplay is dead simple. You have a goal card and you try to collect cards that match that goal (2 pairs, 3 of a kind, a run, etc.). This alone would almost be more of an activity than a game.

But the team aspect makes it more interesting. If you're not able to get cards that help with your goal, you can draw cards specifically to pass to your teammate. You can mostly keep up with which cards in the other players' hands because you draw from a face-up selection of cards a la Ticket to Ride. This adds some strategy in the form of blocking your opponents from reaching their goals because all goals are visible to all players. 

An incredibly simple game that has a nice layer of teamwork to help spice it up a little.

This game is a perfect game for small groups of people who like games but maybe haven't moved too far away from old-school card games. It's small, so you can be flexible with it, and it doesn't take people too long to get the mechanics. The design is crisp and enjoyable. We have a group of 4 who regularly play it and we keep track of which teams win the most. It's a lovely, little game!

RATING: 6
Perfect example of a game that would be dry, abstract, and simplistic as an 'everyone for themselves' competition, but is just fine as a silent partnership game.  You minimally have to pay attention to the cards that your teammate is drawing, which keeps you more engaged than you would be otherwise. 

Still, there's plenty of luck with respect to cards and contracts.  More than hard-core gamers would like, I suspect, though admittedly there's the opportunity to ditch a just-drawn contract for a second random draw.

At heart Western Town is the kind of game I just don't like; one where you collect resources to convert into buildings to collect even more resources.  What makes it more tolerable than the average cube pusher is a higher degree of player interaction than usual.  Choosing a hand of building cards each turn, playing some and then exploiting those others played if you have that card in hand is really quite interesting.  The build up of two Indian raiding parties supplies some randomized headaches, though they seem a little too easy to see off.

Western Town's artwork is quite pleasing, though it scores negative points for some too subtle shading and some impenetrable iconography.  Production quality is good.

Had owned from November 2013 - September 2017 and never got around to playing this one as it wasn't quite the game we thought it was going to be. We gave up on thinking we'd get around to at least trying the game and put it onto the for trade/sale list. It sat there for more than 3 years and nobody had taken it in math trades. Had a hard time selling it for $4, so that seems like an indication of just how good this game really is. Sold in FallCon 30 auction.

Had a chance to play this game at this year's Heidelberger Burgevent and it was an absolute blast. Even though it was 1am in the morning when we started - the rules are complex but easy to grasp after two rounds and I can't wait to see it again in Essen.

Thank you Olivier for the wonderful rules explanation ;)

UPDATE: Played the final version now. Just as I remembered it - VERY good game. My first edition had misprinted tile backs - but don't let that discourage you.

First Play: struggled with the rules at first. The playing structure isn't intuitive. Once we kicked off the play options are quite straightforward. The end game scoring structure is strange and makes efforts put toward getting Lincoln cards hardly worth the effort. Just build buildings and try to second guess your opponents cards. Really this is just another card drafting experience with rather awkward additional mechanics bolted on. The Indian die isn't too random but hey it's still random.

Rule book is hard work and the in game iconography is frankly bloody dreadful. Whoever designed these utterly non intuitive and unintelligible icons should be shot or strung up. This isn't a streamlined game and has a very clunky feel as you stagger through it. It's ok but will appeal more to fans of Dominion.

Western Town has flown under the radar which is sad as it’s a very unique eurogame. This is because of the way you play your cards which is truly innovative! I’m sad that I’ve only got to play it twice so far; I’m definitely intrigued by the gameplay and the strategies.

It’s very important to guess/estimate which cards the other players are using so you can exploit their cards! Otherwise you have no chance of winning. While going first in player order has some advantages, there are also advantages by going later. What was the biggest disappointment in the game was the fact that there can be some some kingmaking when somebody gets to choose where the Indians attack; it actually happened in our game and it actually caused me to lose simply because the player chose me instead of another player… So that left a bad impression, but despite of this I had a lot of fun with the rest of the game, and I’m hoping it was just a coincidence. 

I definitely want to try it again soon and explore some of the other strategies. The replayability seems good because of the different goals and the different buildings which come into play as well as the overall strategies; you can focus on the goals or on some special buildings like the gallows etc., but it never turns into a point salad game (after all, Feld is not the designer…) so that’s definitely a plus.

Excellent firts impressions, a Caylus-like game but with more fun . The card selection mechanism is innovative as well as the interaction thrown in it (use others buidings & cancel their income)

Spoiler alert: I love this game!

Western theme, city building, ressource management, guessing (even if it's something I'm not fond of usually).
Medium weight.

Each player starts with the same basic buildings and associated cards and try its best to build its town while protecting himself from the Native Indians (yes, kind of cliché). Each turn, you'll activate your buildings to your best interest and try to guess what your neighbors will play so you can avoid him from using its buildings.

Very fun!

There's an element to like here with the main action -- leeching action card play, and we all were drawn to it initially, but the game is overloaded. It'd be so much better if it had less. There's just way too much overhead in terms of rules, preparation, and considerations for the players. I realize that last element is usually a good thing, but here you get so jammed up, the game never develops a flow. 

It sounds on paper like a game any heavy gamer should like, but the end result feels sluggish and bloated, not measured and chewy. You have to pick a hand of cards out of the ones in your deck to play each turn, and since the game is so tight and points are so, so hard fought over 5 turns, you can't afford any missteps in choosing which cards will be available to you. There's no going back and getting that card you should've kept in your hand. You need to think through so many "action to resource to action" steps to make sure you can do what you want and then hope the other players comply by playing cards that will help you with leeching actions. 

This all sounds like a lot of fun, but the result ends up being a lot of AP and downtime as players think through the exigencies of each turn followed by incremental moves. If all that thinking and planning time was followed by ever more powerful moves as the game goes on, I'd probably find it satisfying, but you never get more than 3 basic actions (leeching actions may add), and it's more likely that your plans will be retarded by other players and not aggrandized. A lot of thinking + small moves + player interference = not the return on mental investment I like. See the way [gameid=140620] or [gameid=119012] gives you thinky turns that result in more and more powerful effects as the game goes on.

Furthermore, you're not allowed to know what the value of the VP categories will be till the penultimate turn such that the experience is highly tactical, and just when you get an engine going, the game ends. This aspect seems clearly intentional in the design, as are the foggy VP category values, but they add to the sense of being boxed in. I can't help but feel the game would be better off with less going on or with more powerful results throughout the game. 

NOTE: I *strongly* suggest if you are going to try this game to play a practice round first and then restart.

Western Town is a card game based on 2 aspects : bluff and incitement.

Building are not placed on a common board : each player has a board representing his city where his buildings are constructed. Each constructed building brings a card into the owner's hand, ready to be played straight away. Each card can be played in 2 ways :
- for your own : you play a card to activate a building in your town -- The Gold Mine earns you 1 or 2 gold, the Bank allows you to earn a gold, send a gold to the nation (federal government) but you must roll the indian dice (sending a gold convoy increase their anger).
- in order to exploit other player's same building : you get extra action -- The Gold mine earns you 1 gold, the Bank allows you to send a gold to the nation (without dice rolling) and you opponent won't earn anything at the end of turn (lure in general).

So this mechanic brings interesting choices with strong theme integration :
- what cards to choose for this turn given what you want/plan to do and the buildings of your opponents ?
- what cards to play for your own ?
- what cards to play to exploit other players ?
- will you go for originality -- you are not copied, not exploited and you will earn lure at the end of the turn
- will you copy one's town -- they built a lucrative Saloon, why not you ?

You will have to keep and eye on Lincoln desire :
- population ? focus yourself on Homesteads, Saloon and Hotel. Capitalize your population with the Barber (i love this card !) or the General Store
- gold sent to the nation ? run you Gold Mine, your Bank and your Marshal but beware of indians !
- lure ? be original in order to earn lure at the end of each turn (your buildings won't be exploited) or build and run a Saloon

And defend yourself against indians : after all, the Gunsmith, the Blacksmith and the Church are here for that.

What i liked :
- The bluffing aspect : who will fire (=play a card) the first ? who will play first his third card ?
- The strong theme : building are self explanatory-- the more you send gold convoys, the more you can see an indian attack
- Space exploitation of the city : the more you build near the indian camp, the more you distrupt them and see an indian attack; it is easy to defend a downtown building against indians
- Great combo system
- General concept and mechanism : lure and exploitation system
- Transformation of peace pipes into lure : an elegant, simple and thematic mechanism to bring tension and focusing the game. The more you city is developped and attractive, the more it is a potential target for indians

Nagyon tematikus, elég érdekes mechanizmusok. Azonban túl nagy tanulási idő, kell legalább 5-6 játék, hogy élvezetes legyen és egy-egy játék nagyon el tud húzódni. Ezen felül az akasztófát az első játék után túl erősnek érzem, valamint a kezdőjáték szinte behozhatatlanul nagy hátránnyal indul.

Some interesting ideas that never really form a greater whole.  Western Town suffers from too much thought and too little control.  The highly tactical play over burdens the long term strategy.  

The feel is strange as well, almost as if it is spiritually bent.  Some players can feel as though they are riding along easy street while others are exploited and kicked in the teeth.  The end result however can reflect this situation almost 180 degrees. 

The actions fall in line thematically, but I haven't felt like I was pushing wooden cubes around this much in a long time.  

Graphically, the icons drastically remove any sense of aesthetic immersion and help to dry up this one horse town.  

Playing this again will take a herculean effort with a silver tongue by the person who introduces it to the table.

„Porfészekből Lincoln kedvenc városa”
Röviden: egy kis vadnyugati porfészket a törvény emberként irányítasz, felvirágoztatsz miközben még jóban is szeretnél lenni az indiánokkal.
A játék nem mai gyermek és az euro oltárán született meg. A játékosok az 5 fix forduló fázisaiban fejlesztgetik városaikat. A különböző épületeket, tevékenységeket ábrázoló kártyákból a Vezető Marshall-al megkezdve kettőt kijátszva (ebben is van egy kis csavar) végrehajtod azok kijátszási hatásait (épületek felépítése, nyersanyagok megszerzése, városod vonzóbbá tétele, fejlesztése, indiánok megjelenése, …). Ezek után vagy kijátszol még egy kártyát annak kijátszási hatásáért vagy a szomszédjaid épületét kihasználva, azt inaktívvá téve kihasználod a lap „exploit” hatását. Ha 3 lapot kijátszottál passzolhatsz, és ekkor megkapod a Vezető Marshall tisztséget, tehát a következő fordulóban te leszel a kezdőjátékos (illetve a jobb oldaladon ülő megkapja a Nagy Törzsfő szerepet).
Az épületek felépítésének fontos szerepe van. Ezek után kapod meg annak lapját, amit később kijátszhatsz, illetve kihasználhatod szomszédjaid épületeit. A játék végén pontot jelenetnek és minden forduló elején meghatározzák, hogy a rendelkezésre álló lapok közül mennyit tudsz a kezedben tartani.
Miután mindenki passzolt megkapod a kijátszott 3 lapod közül az aktívak bevételét (amennyit tárolni tudsz a felépített épületeken és a játékostábládon) és megjelenik maga Lincoln is abban a városban, amely a forduló elején általa meghatározott (minden fordulóban más-más) elvárásokat a legjobban teljesítette.
Az Indiánok még külön említést érdemlenek, mert képesek a városokat megtámadni, amit csak tehenészlegényeiddel tudsz kivédeni, ha akarsz. Itt jut szerep a Nagy Törzsfőnek, akinek a kezében van a döntés, hogy a megvadult rézbőrűek kit és mit is támadnak meg.
Az ötödik forduló után pontozás és vége a kalandnak.
Maga a játékelemek nyelv függetlenek, az ikonográfia pár játék alatt elsajátítható. Az épületek képességeit részletező segédlap és a szabály magyarul nem, de más nyelveken elérhető.
Az alaplépések könnyen tanulhatóak, azonban csak több játék alatt érhető el, hogy tényleg átlásd a lehetőségeidet, a megfelelő kombókat. Illetve a játékidő is eléggé elhúzódhat.
A játékba kódolt „mindgame” (milyen lapokat tartasz meg a kezedben, milyen sorrendben játszod ki őket, mit és kit használsz ki) tetszett a legjobban, így ajánlani tudom kipróbálásra.

I like it, I dislike it, I like it, I dislike it...

The first couple of games have been pure frustration and as people told me, that seems to be true for anyone who is new to this. Completely counter-intuitive and hard to get into.

Well, the good thing is, it's very different from other games and it works, just not as good as one may hope for. The option to abuse someone else's building (denying resources and forcing him top start the next round, which is bad) is just frustrating and nothing else. I like direct interaction and all this, but this leaves a very bad taste.

Next problem are the buildings. They are not balanced at all. Some can earn you ALOT points, while others can't and since everyone got the same buildings to build, it's like forcing them to do the same.

To sum it up, good ideas, but not so good execution.

RATING: 6
First impression: A bit muddled. Our 3+ hour learning game was intriguing but this game is not easy to learn. There is room for subtle play, as position and turn order manipulation can be very useful. There are a lot of small contests that are prone to ties, and the tiebreakers are maddeningly arbitrary. Still, I suspect the player who can manipulate the cards best will win. Getting lots of actions via "exploiting" your opponents' cards is key. To do this you'll want to try to predict what your opponents will play, which is pretty interesting. 

It has to be noted that this is one of the worst game productions I've seen from a usability standpoint. Each card is full of complex glyphs that look like they've been inscribed by space aliens. And tiny print too? Oh yes. Lines of near-microscopic icons line the bottom of each of your tiles. At least the game comes with a full list of what the card text ought to have been. You'll want to read up on every single card. If I owned this game I would probably print out the English translations and paste/sleeve the cards. That alone would help shift the game from very unwieldy to mostly playable.

The design certainly has some merit, and it says a lot that I actually would like to play this again in spite of a truly atrocious presentation.

RATING: 8.5
Very clever game. Parallels to Glass Road in terms of hand management, but it's cleverer than that.

There's a strong benefit to going a different way to your opponents so that you can get your end of round bonuses, but there's also a strong benefit in going the same way as them so that you can do the bottom half of theirs... Very keen to try out more tactics here to work out which of these two contradictory paths is optimal.

There's a bluff element (as to what you pick into your hand) and it's all about managing your position in the round to ensure that you are able to continue taking actions while others must or play their third card, thus giving you new options to copy.

Big hand sizes are far more beneficial than they first seem. Also don't disregard building multiple additional homesteads. Playing the homestead card each round ensures a strong population - especially so if you have 4/5 of the homestead buildings.

At the end of it all never lose sight of the aim of the game. Population, Reputation and Exportation are the three ways you will gain favour with Lincoln each round (this is a BIG benefit) and also the three ways in which you will score a strong chunk of end game points. Do NOT get left behind in any of these three races.

Great game!!

In Western Town, players are building their towns in order to score points at game's end by having built certain buildings and having best pleased President Lincoln each round by making their towns attractive, increasing population, and exporting gold to the capital. Each turn players play two cards in order to build buildings or gain/convert population and the resources gold, wood, and lure. Lure represents the attractiveness of your town to the citizenry, but it comes at the cost of "peace pipes", which makes you more susceptible to attacks from the natives. Buildings can grant points, increased hand-sizes, additional homes, and additional storage in addition to giving you an additional card to play. 

After every player has played two cards there is an "Exploit" phase where, beginning with the start player, everyone takes turns exploiting a card of one of their neighbors. You have to have played the same card yourself or have it in your hand in order to do so. By exploiting the card, not only do you get something - usually a resource - the player you exploited needs to turn the card over and it won't earn income for them this turn. There are a few mechanical design contortions for this to work. Players have a hand limit they must discard down to at the start of their turns, making half or more of their cards inactive for the round. That's where the guessing comes in for what you might be able to exploit. Also, the active player and the next player play their cards face down simultaneously in order to limit the turn order advantage inherent in the idea. 

Additionally, some actions get the natives riled up and they eventually attack and are usually controlled by the player last in turn order. I also dislike directed attacks that have no impact or cost for the director. The game isn't terrible and there are some interesting things going on, but with a few primary aspects running against my tastes, it isn't for me.

Hand building game that was way ahead of it's time. The core of the game is, however, the exploitation mechanism that really requires you to pay attention to what others are doing and to read the game. I really like both the exploitation and the hand building. What's lacking is the graphic layout with mini sized icons and some confusing iconography. The game also probably plays best with four as exploitation is likely to function best when there's one player who you can't exploit and also the indians are likely to be more active.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Played two player I found it quite interesting to play with the different buildings and strategy options for gaining points. One definitely wants to guess well in what the other player is doing in order to potentially make that person lose his/her income and get a special exploitation action. I think the variant of the first person going out choosing what role they want to be is likely quite important to use. Cards come into play when one builds the respective building but one can only potentially exploit someone else if both have the card/building in play.

---- Preliminary thoughts ----
The base is an engine building game that seems quite fine, with a nice deal of interaction (trying to second guess other players actions/cards to deny bonuses), but there are some issues:
-> The game is overloaded with mechanics and things that, while might seem cool to euro-lovers, make the game too heavy, prone to AP. Just too much stuff. 
-> The guessing mechanic doesn't mix well with the game being that exigent; others players' interferences and wrong guessing make the mental effort required by the game not worthy.
-> The rulebook is a pain.
-> Quite pricey.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Simple resource collection through outguessing and occasionally heavy take that. The exploit system is fascinating, and I'd be willing to try this again to see whether there's a real game behind all that face-punching. Edit: Tried again with three players. There was very little indian activity, and the exploit phase was quite short. Looks like the game works best with four players.

Some visibility issues with the icons, and the rulebook does not perform very well at explaining actual gameplay. The rulebook is also quite poorly structured, with lots of essential rules hidden in the side notes; The most important of these being the rules for multiple homesteads, and the effects of 'destroyed' markers.

Somewhat expensive, and you don't even get any meeples unless you buy the expansion as well.

One 2 player game to get acquainted, the first impression was positive, this rate might go up or down, depending on the further games with more players. Nice that playing card and exploitation phases, it gets quite tactical, and seems that the 3 or 4 player game is where the game might shine. In the 2 player game, as soon as you are the only with some buildings the exploitation vanishes, what might not happen with more players.

This is a city-building game based in the American West.  Players used resources to place buildings on their player board, allowing them access to the card associated with the building.  Later, if they drew that card, they could take the associated action.  However, if someone else had that same card, they could reveal that card without playing it to gain some minor bonuses and deny some end-turn bonuses to the targeted player.  As such, it was very interactive--you really wanted to pay close attention to what other players were doing to take advantage of them and prevent them from doing the same.  I really liked that about the game--it felt fairly innovative to me.  Beyond that, though, the game was a mess.  It felt very unpolished.  The start player is at a clear disadvantage, as he has to play his cards first, and further, he's likely to remain start player as he'll probably run out of cards first.  The rules are a complete disaster too.  Some good concepts here, but I wish it had more polish and/or playtesting.

Very good worker placement with some original ideas. My fellow players didn't like the indian camp, but I found it to be a nice addition. The only minus with this game is that the iconagraphy isn't all that clear, resulting in players who have to look up what everything is doing and lots of downtime on your first game. But off course, this will resolve itself with more plays.

Decent game. The rulebook is bad at explaining the rules, and the iconography takes some getting used to, but once we got going, we were having a good time. In this game, you get five rounds to build your town and then you score based on how much the accumulated Lincon cards like what you've done, plus your building points. In our game, I had trouble knowing what to focus on, as there is a card play element similar to Glass Road, where other players can get benefits from your stuff if they predict correctly what you are going to play. You are also at risk when you take certain actions of being attacked by Native Americans, (who yes, as sadly represented as colored red and orange meeples).

At Essen "Spiel12" fair we played a complete short game with only two rounds.
This game offers an innovative new mechanism of how to do actions. I can either use my own handcard or I can exploit the played cards of the player to my right or left. There is little luck involved in this game (only the drawing of the president cards and the dice rolling of how many indians are going to attack). There are lots of buildings with special function that I may build in my town. I'd like to play it again to better see how it works.

Everyone starts with the same buildings and the same cards.  Granted players will have variations on their start position as a result of the Western Town Marshall cards, but there doesn't seem to be any advantage to any particular Marshall.  The decision is how to expand out from that base effectively.  Not only in playing cards, but also in managing the exploit phase of the game.  That will drive which subset of cards to keep active in hand.

Rules are rather quickly explained (the devil is in the details of the various buildings, but each player will have a handy summary sheet so is free to ponder on their own.)  Game is likely to start rather cooperatively, but will be a bit more cutthroat once players realize how they can interfere with each other.  As well as seeing just how is leading and then try to gain on their position by outscoring them and/or reducing their scoring potential.

Building and development Euro with building activation mechanic. Thematic failure but unique play. More interaction than the usual Euro - but it is of the French School, which explains that, I think. The "exploit phase" is the heart & soul of this title and what sets it apart from other Euros.

Number of players: 3
Time: 3h (with explanations)

First game for everybody, so we spent a few minutes to look at the components and the rulebook even though two of us have already read them.

Inventory:
We quickly identified each component. The only surprise was about the building tiles, which are printed on both sides (and we did not see that, at first). Cards could be bigger for an easier reading. Other details were a little bit odd but we were playing on a prototype and the author told us it was to be changed. Last but not least, the iconography is more than effective (and the author said it was the only “definitive” part… great!). Drawings should help the immersion, especially on the boards: a big town illustration will definitely put you under the skin of a Marshal.

Preparation:
Here is the moment we found difficulty with the rulebook: the setup of the starting buildings seemed quite confuse to us. Indeed, some buildings are placed on each player’s board, others are the initial ones and can be built by everybody, and the remaining ones are randomly chosen to be played on their front side or their “Dwelling” side (the back one) and are available from turn 1, 2 or 3. Maybe including these statuses on the boards would clarify this point.

Phases of a turn:
Phases 2 and 3 are not easy to understand because they are truly the original part of the game, and the difference between “first player” and “active player” is very important. Having read it twice, it seems quite clear, finally, but the first view requires attention, in particular about the visualization.

Mechanics:
First of all, once the setup done, you really feel the potential of the game thanks to the numerous buildings and the setup cards: at the beginning of the game, each town is different so each player will have to deal with it using what he has and what is available.

Lincoln cards also contextualize each game. They make Western Town kind of a delivery game in which one has to manage at best to satisfy a demand you know in advance.

During phase 2, the disadvantage of first player –who need to guess everything– is balanced by his rank for phase 3, during which playing first can be decisive. In our 3-player game, phase 2 was quickly done. Each one felt like missing actions, which is a proof that WT is a good game with tension.

The fact that you get in hand the card of a building as soon as you built it is quite similar to a deckbuilding game. I even made this funny mistake during turn 2: I discarded the card to draw it later the next turn instead of… This point made me think of the immediate effect of A few acres of snow, and I do appreciate that.

One building seems unavoidable at the beginning: the woodwork. Indeed, all of us used it during the first turns to get a 5- or 6-card hand, and the more the game goes on, the more difficult it is to play it. However, nobody built a second one. When reading this piece of advice, do not forget it was our first play; I am sure we did not see some “building” combos.

Phase 3 is merely awesome. It gives a tactical finesse which is very pleasant and a guessing aspect which is very original in this kind of game. We also found the option of playing a third action quite surprising , but the author told us we made a mistake with this point: a third action does not oblige you to pass. Knowing that, it now makes sense and I guess there are even more possibilities during this phase.

Indians seem well balanced. All of us played carefully and the threat was never too far. They attacked me twice but the consequences were not too dreadful: it only took me little time in my town’s development.

Final score (quite simple):
1/ Black houses. The idea of earning points thanks to who has the majority and also how many players rank after you is great and really original because differences between possible configurations matter.
2/ Lincoln’s wishes are a good idea, too, because they reward the whole game efforts and let the opportunity to come back during the last turns.
3/ Buildings. A way no one shall forget, especially the ones with Heroes and hanged cow-boys.

Even if everything is perfect, here, I think that buildings’ position should also be taken into account. Julien talked about a “main street”, and it is an interesting thing. In Carson City, for instance, position means points depending on the type of buildings and their place on the board. The immersion would be emphasized with this way to earn points during and/or at the end of the game. The author is working on that point, looking for a solution that would keep the game’s fluidity.

Another discussion to have after next game would be about the loop between Peace Pipe and Development points. Indeed, all my Peace Pipe points turned quite quickly into Development ones, so Development was no more important for me at the end of the game. Even if I was the Indians’ best target, was this a bad idea?

To conclude, I truly enjoyed this game. There are many combos, a good turnover with many different setups, and a very original interaction very well thought.

About the experience itself, I tried what seemed natural to me: Lincoln’s wishes. I finally got all the cards, even if Jokerounet was always close to me.

First, I took a Gold for the Nation strategy whereas Jokerounet was playing the Inhabitants and Tomstille was building a big city prison where one cow-boy out of two was hanged. Then, I developed my town to make it more attractive; Indians were not happy with that so they destroyed some dwellings. In the end, result was predictable: Jokerounet’s city was very polyvalent but this was not what Lincoln wanted so he earned less points (hey, this is a combo game, okay?), and Tomstille finally ranked second thanks to a point generator he was the only one to use.

Last word: to play again ASAP. ^^

Oh my, I enjoyed this a lot on my first play. We fudged a few rules (yay for speed reading rules at a convention!), but I love the interesting choices to be made at every turn: engine building which then allows a sort of deck building which then becomes a hand management game plus a little bit of cube churning (not usually my sort of thing), coupled with some beautiful art work and variable set-ups and available cards.

Just wow.

I love the artwork, I love how the designer solved the integration of indians in not only a mechanical but highly thematic way (good idea of turning peace pipes into appeal. Flourishing cities = more and more people coming = indians feeling threatened in their lifestyle and fearing for their lands - once again:big thumps up to this great idea!)

Other than that I must say, that it feels like a regular cube converter machine with aninnovative game engine that keeps the whole thing running at a pleasant pace. So despite the artwork (and the indians) it only manages to convey its theme mediocre.
Also, I think population is way too weak a factor. 
And last but not least the rulebook  could really go way more into detail. Some things aren't clarified and one has to deduct from previous experience how things could be handled.Why not have an "end of the round"-chapter?  Also there are some translation errata which become obvious only when counterchecking with the english or french rules. Also the end game scoring is lacking. Why only award the most households? Why not award i.e. most population, most peace pipes, most cowboys, fewest spaces left on player board etc.? 

Nevertheless, it's the best Western-themed game I've played so far.

The game is not bad, but it incorporates too many different mechanics that make the game overall fiddly.
I think that it could be streamlined a little bit with some house rules.
